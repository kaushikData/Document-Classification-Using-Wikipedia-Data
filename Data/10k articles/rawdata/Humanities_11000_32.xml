      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3239">'''Alphabet soup''' is a metaphor for an abundance of [[abbreviation]]s or [[acronym]]s, named for a common dish made from [[alphabet pasta]]. Use dates at least as far back as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt's]] [[alphabet agencies]] of the [[New Deal#Notable New Deal programs|New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746464,00.html "Relief: Alphabet Soup"], ''Time Magazine'', December 11, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the [[United States Government|Federal Government]] is described as an alphabet soup on account of the multitude of agencies that it has spawned, including the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], [[CIA]], [[FBI]], [[United States Secret Service|USSS]], [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|NCIS]], [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] and [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]].   In 1938, a US barbershop harmony organization was founded, aptly named [[SPEBSQSA]] or '''The Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America, Inc.''' as a humorous lampoon to these numerous "alphabet soup" agencies.

The alphabet soup metaphor has been used to describe issues in comprehension that have major effects on scholarship, including confusion between different theories. One such example of alphabet soup affecting scholarship is in [[Statistics|statistical testing]], in which distinction between p and α are not always made clear because of the "alphabet soup" of letters referring to statistical evidence and errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hubbard|first=Raymond|date=2016-08-18|title=Alphabet Soup: Blurring the Distinctions Betweenp’s anda’s in Psychological Research|url=http://tap.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0959354304043638|journal=Theory &amp; Psychology|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=295–327|doi=10.1177/0959354304043638}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many different distinctions between types of [[pneumonia]] have also been described as an alphabet soup, requiring a scholarly article detailing the differences between the many acronyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anand|first=Nitin|last2=Kollef|first2=Marin|date=2009-02-01|title=The Alphabet Soup of Pneumonia: CAP, HAP, HCAP, NHAP, and VAP|url=http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-0028-1119803|journal=Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|language=en|volume=30|issue=01|pages=003–009|doi=10.1055/s-0028-1119803|issn=1069-3424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alphabet soup is also used to describe historical language scripts that appear as long sequences of symbols that do not have clear demarcations of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howe|first=Nicholas R.|last2=Feng|first2=Shaolei|last3=Manmatha|first3=R.|year=2009|title=Finding words in alphabet soup: Inference on freeform character recognition for historical scripts|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320309000375|journal=Pattern Recognition|volume=42|issue=12|pages=3338–3347|doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2009.01.012|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bao Luong''' (1909-1976) was born Nguyen Trung Nguyet (“faithful moon), in the rural [[Bình Đại District]] of Vietnam’s [[Bến Tre Province]].  She was a member of the [[Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League]], a communist group fighting against French rule in Vietnam. She became the first female political prisoner in Vietnam. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Passion, Betrayal, and the Revolution in Colonial Saigon: The Memoirs of Bao Luong|last=Ho Tai|first=Hue-Tam|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

= Early life =
Nguyen Trung Nguyet grew up on her parents farm in Binh Dai. Although few girls received an education at this time, Nguyen Trung Nguyet went to an all-boys night school run by her uncle. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2011/03/bao-luong|title=Brief Life of Bao Luong|last=Ho Tai|first=Hue Tam|date=2011|website=Harvard University Press|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At nine years old her family moved from Binh Dai to [[Rạch Giá|Rach Gia]] (now [[Kiên Giang Province|Kien Giang]]), and at age twelve, they again uprooted to Phuoc Long (now part of [[Bạc Liêu Province|Bac Lieu Province]]). Her father, Nguyen van Nham, was a French resistor, and told her stories of anticolonial resistance. He encouraged her to write patriotic poems and question the French rule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  At her age, most young Vietnamese women were expected to be married, but Nguyen Trung Nguyet did not want to be distracted from the revolution against the French. Trung Nguyet often tried to persuade her parents to let her leave home to engage in revolutionary activities, but they resisted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the Spring of 1927, Nguyen Trung Nguyet left home for Saigon, where she stayed with her aunt, Kim Oanh and her uncle Ton Duc Thang. Around the time she left home, Nguyen Trung Nguyet adopted the name Bao Luong (“Precious Honesty”), which she had originally used as a pen name while writing poetry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

= Activism =
Her uncle, [[Tôn Đức Thắng|Ton Duc Thang]] was the leader of the southern section of the [[Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After four months, during which Ton Duc Thang assessed Bao Luong’s interest and potential, she was recruited to join the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League. Training for the Youth League was in Guangzhou, China, and before boarding the boat, Bao Luong’s family disguised her as a boy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her true identity was discovered only after she gained the trust and loyalty of the other revolutionary activists on board. In Guangzhou, Bao and the other trainees attended lectures on revolutionary ideologies, evolution, and the socialist movement.  At the training school, Bao wrote poetry and other articles for the cause. When her training was complete, she went back to her family in Phuoc Long.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Her first task was to convince her family to support her efforts in the revolution, and her parents vowed to support her and keep her secret&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  She went on to recruit women to join the revolution. Bao Luong traveled throughout the Mekong Delta pretending to sell fabric. Along the way, she gathered women that supported the Revolutionary Youth League. Many of these women hoped that the revolution would lead to education reforms and the freedom to choose their own husbands.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bao Luong then received permission to start an all-women cell of the Revolutionary Youth League. She hosted meetings that gathered women from a wide geographical area, spanning five regions. All female meetings were unprecedented at the time, and Bao’s superiors warned her to be more careful. At these meetings, the women decided to use poetry to spread the anticolonial message, and used stories of exemplary women throughout history to help make their points.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

= Murder on Barbier Street =
Bao Luong’s passionate fight against French rule led her to become involved in an assassination plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeWald|first=Erich|date=June 2013|title=Patronage, Passion, and the Power of Networks|url=|journal=Cross Currents: East Asian History and Culture Review|volume=7|pages=118–120|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 1928, Le van Phat was found in his home on Barbier Street.  Le van Phat was known as Lang to the members of the Revolutionary Youth League. Lang was the chairman of the Saigon Provincial regional committee of the Revolutionary Youth League. Lang was accused of forcing a younger member of his cell to become his mistress. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=R.B|date=October 1998|title=The Foundation of the Indochinese Communist Party, 1929-1930|url=|journal=Cambridge University Press Modern Asian Studies|volume=32|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also began abusing power, disrespecting orders, and missing meetings. Bao Luong chaired the meeting where the decision to execute Lang's murder was made.  She directed members at the meeting to draw ballots to see who would commit the murder and three men (including Bao Luong's cousin) were selected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bao Luong drafted a love letter which was used to make sure Lang would be home at the time of the murder.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her cousin and the two other men attempted to kill Lang with poison, before slitting his throat. The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Youth League was against the murder and ordered the Saigon cell to disband. This group went on to become the Communist Party of Indochina. After Bao Luong and her fellow Saigon cell members refused, an anonymous letter was sent to the [[Republic of Vietnam National Police]], known as the [[Sûreté|Surete]], that implicated Bao Luong and other league members in the murder of Lang. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

= Imprisonment and later life =
Bao Luong was beaten in prison, as the Surete tried to get her to confess. She was then moved to the Saigon Central Prison, where she awaited trial. At her trial, she spoke out to the French judge about the poor treatment of women in French Indochina and maintained her revolutionary ideas. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;She was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison, but her behavior in court added three more years to her sentence. The men who committed the murder were sentenced to death.  Her mentor and uncle, Ton Duc Thang, served a short prison sentence before becoming the president of [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In prison, a male nurse who cared for Bao Luong fell in love with her. Through an intermediary, the nurse (Nguyen van Thom) asked her family for her hand in marriage. After being questioned by the head of the prison for his plans to marry Bao Luong upon her release, Nguyen van Thom quit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  After Bao's release, the two moved to O Mon and had children. She was later encouraged to rejoin the revolution, but denied the invitation to care for her children and in-laws. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Plot==
Set in the late 90s in Delhi, Bhanwarey &lt;ref&gt;https://www.filmipop.com/movies/bhanwarey-movie-15151/reviews&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dekhnews.com/entertainment/bhanwarey-movie-review/&lt;/ref&gt; revolves around three friends and their struggle of survival in a shoddy apartment. It is also the story of their daily problems and how they accidentally get involved in wrongdoings, drugs, a porn racket, news media and to solve these problems they eventually get trapped between the hand of law and a couple of gangster groups.

Manoj ([[Shaurya Singh]]) and Pushp (Karhan Dev) live together in an apartment in Delhi. Machchinder (Jashan Singh), their third friend lives in the same building as well. While Manoj has a girl friend Soniya (Priyanka Shukla), he is still not settled in the city and is jobless. Whereas Pushp has a job but is pervert by nature.

Manoj is trying different methods to cure sexual weakness in him which gets him and his roommate Pushp into trouble.
One day Pushp introduces Manoj to Raghav (Puneet Kumar), a childhood friend of his, who is a member of a rock band. While talking to him, Raghav introduces Manoj to a performance enhancement drug which Manoj takes without any precautions and ends up roaming the streets of Delhi, like a ghoul, without any memory of it the next day.

Raghav is a drug addict who is in debt of an underworld don Maqsood bhai (Manoj Bakshi) who has multiple illegal businesses such as Drugs, Porn films, extortion etc. 
While Manoj wants to experiment with the drug, Raghav takes Manoj to Maqsood’s den. As both of them didn’t have money, Maqsood forces Manoj into performing in a porn film made by his gang. Maqsood tells them that this film will not be sold in India and will only sell overseas.

Contrary to Maqsood’s words, the forthcoming week, the porn movie DVDs spread in the capital.

The gang members while writing one of the DVDs mistakenly write Maqsood’s important data on the DVD and distribute it. This DVD falls in the hands of Pushp.

Inspector Hukum Singh (Padmender Rawat) gets under the radar of his senior police officers for under-performing and is asked to solve this porn racket case, failing of which could cost him his job. Maqsood and his gang members want to retrieve the DVD. Inspector Hukum Singh too is after the boys, specially Manoj after the news leaks into media that some local boy has worked in a porn film. Manoj, Pushp and Machchi get into the hands of Maqsood’s gang while trying to escape from Hukum Singh and media. Machchi handovers the DVD to Maqsood and they manage to escape from Maqsood’s den only to realize that Machchi has handed over the wrong DVD to Maqsood.

Manoj, Pushp and Machchinder seek help from a local small time goon Susu Pandey (Matin Khan). But he too has different motives for utilizing the DVD for his own benefits. They run away from Susu Pandey only to get caught by Ins. Hukum Singh and party.

Hukum Singh along with his constable beat them black and blue and they narrate the whole story to Hukum Singh. Hukum Singh formulates a plan to catch Maqsood and his gang along with Manoj, Pushp and Machchi.

Maqsood calls Manoj at a secluded warehouse where Machchi fails the plan and falls from the roof where he was hidden. Hukum Singh, Pushp and Raghav come to rescue Manoj and Machchi. Susu Pandey gang too joins the rumble in the warehouse. After a long battle the goons are caught and Manoj’s sexual health problem is solved after he falls into a bagful of Indian herbs known for curing sex problems.

The DVD is still missing.

The '''California Dream''' is the psychological motivation to gain fast wealth or fame in a new land. As a result of the [[California Gold Rush]] after 1849, [[California|California's]] name became indelibly connected with the Gold Rush, and fast success in a new world became known as the "California Dream".&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Starr, ''Americans and the California Dream, 1850–1915'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; California was perceived as a place of new beginnings, where great wealth could reward hard work and good luck. The notion inspired the idea of an [[American Dream]]. California was seen as a lucky place, a land of opportunity and good fortune. It was a powerful belief, underlying many of the accomplishments of the state, and equally potent when threatened.&lt;ref&gt;Starr,'' Americans and the California Dream'' and Starr, ''Inventing the Dream'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historian [[H. W. Brands]] noted that in the years after the Gold Rush, the California Dream spread across the nation:
:{{cquote|The old American Dream . . . was the dream of the Puritans, of Benjamin Franklin's "Poor Richard" . . . of men and women content to accumulate their modest fortunes a little at a time, year by year by year. The new dream was the dream of instant wealth, won in a twinkling by audacity and good luck.  &lt;nowiki&gt;[This]&lt;/nowiki&gt; golden dream . . . became a prominent part of the American psyche only after [[Sutter's Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;Brands, 2003), p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Overnight, California gained the international reputation as the "golden state"—with gold and lawlessness the main themes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Burchell, "The Loss of a Reputation; or, The Image of California in Britain before 1875," ''California Historical Quarterly'' 53 (Summer I974): 115–30, shows that stories about Gold Rush lawlessness deterred immigration for two decades.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Seal of California.svg|thumb|right|[[Seal of California]]]]

==Migrants==

Generations of immigrants have been attracted by the California Dream. California farmers,&lt;ref&gt;Starr, 2005), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; oil drillers,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.,'' [[Signal Hill, California]], [[Bakersfield, California]]; [[History of Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles, California]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cinema of the United States|movie makers]],&lt;ref&gt;Leading studios include  [[20th Century Fox]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Universal Pictures]], [[Columbia Pictures]], and [[United Artists]]&lt;/ref&gt; aerospace corporations &lt;ref&gt;Such as [[Hughes Aircraft]], [[Douglas Aircraft]], [[North American Aviation]], [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]], and [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Aircraft]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dot-com bubble|"dot-com" entrepreneurs]] have each had their boom times in the decades after the Gold Rush.
[[Image:California Clipper 500.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Sailing to California at the beginning of the Gold Rush]]

Part of the "California Dream" was "that every family could have its own private home."&lt;ref&gt;Warren A. Beck, David A. Williams, ''California: a history of the Golden State'' (1972) p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Orr, "Joy Neugebauer Purchasing the California Dream in Postwar Suburbia," ch 12 in ''The human tradition in California'' ed. by Clark Davis, David Igler (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Starr has pointed out, for many if not most migrants to the golden state, "the dream outran the reality."&lt;ref&gt;Starr (1985) p. viii&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Okies]] of the 1930s "found their California dream transformed into a nightmare,' notes Walter Stein.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Stein, ''California and the Dust Bowl Migration'' (1973) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, "the California Dream is a love affair with an idea, a marriage to a myth" &lt;ref&gt;Claudia K. Jurmain, ''California: a place, a people, a dream'' (1986) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Observers report a common stereotyped perception that people are happier in California. This perception is anchored in the perceived superiority of the California climate, and is justified to some extent by the fact that Californians are indeed more satisfied with their climate than are Midwesterners, with much of California enjoying a [[Mediterranean climate]]. Surveys of students show the advantages of life in California were not reflected in differences in the self-reported overall life satisfaction of those who live there.&lt;ref&gt;Schkade and Kahneman. "Does Living in California Make People Happy?'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
Historian [[Kevin Starr]] in his seven-volume history of the state has explored in great depth the "California Dream"—the realization by ordinary Californians of the [[American Dream]]. California starting in the late 19th century promised the highest possible standard of life for the middle classes, and indeed for the skilled blue collar workers and farm owners as well. Poverty existed, but was concentrated among the migrant farm workers made famous in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', where the Joad family, driven out of the [[Dust Bowl]], searches for the California Dream.  By the 1950s the Joads and the other "Okies" and "Arkies" (migrants from Oklahoma and Arkansas) were achieving the dream too.  It was not so much the upper class (who preferred to live in New York and Boston). The California Dream meant an improved and more affordable family life: a small but stylish and airy house marked by a fluidity of indoor and outdoor space, such as the ubiquitous California bungalow and a lush [[backyard]]—the stage, that is, for quiet family life in a sunny climate. It meant very good jobs, excellent roads, plentiful facilities for outdoor recreation, and the schools and universities that were the best in the world by the 1940s. James M. Cain, an eastern writer who visited the Golden State, reported in 1933 that the archetypal Californian "addresses you in easy grammar, completes his sentences, shows familiarity with good manners, and in addition gives you a pleasant smile."&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Starr, ''Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance, 1950–1963'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural phenomena which have fed into the California Dream include the rise of the [[Hollywood]] film industry, [[Silicon Valley]], California's aerospace industry, the [[History of California wine|California wine industry]] and the [[Dotcom boom]]. The phrase has been used in describing Californian's struggles to find a suitable location in the state to achieve success, in 2017, when the cost of living in places like the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] were prohibitive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/11/18/bay-area-residents-seek-the-california-dream-in-sacramento/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "Taking the Cure" was conjured to describe 1950s "u-haul" migrants who, after a year or so pined for home. One drive back home was enough to convince them to stay after all.

==Popular culture==
[[File:La-et-ms-los-angeles-sheet-music-20130529-dto-002.jpg|thumb|1907 sheet music for ''Glorious Southern California'']]
The term has been referenced in numerous media, most notably in the song title ''[[California Dreamin']]'', with "California dreaming" used in book and film titles that reference some aspect of the California Dream,  such as the 2007 film ''[[California Dreaming (2007 film)|California Dreaming]]'', and the 2005 UK reality TV series ''[[California Dreaming (TV series)|California Dreaming]]''. [[Lawrence Donegan]]'s ''California Dreaming: A Smooth-running, Low-mileage, Cut-price American Adventure'' references the California, (and American) Dream. Also referencing it is poet [[Christopher Buckley (poet)|Christopher Buckley]]'s ''Sleepwalk: California dreamin' and a last dance with the '60s''. Numerous songs have been written about the California Dream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/columnone/la-et-ms-los-angeles-sheet-music-20130529-dto,0,4682948.htmlstory]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{nihongo|Nyāko|にゃーこ}}, the older sister of {{nihongo|Nyatta|にゃっ太}}, lies very ill in her room. By accident, Nyatta drowns in the bathtub and, whilst being clinically dead, sees his sister leaving the house holding hands with the Japanese version of [[Ksitigarbha]] (known as Jizou in Japanese) and proceeds to follow them. Nyatta tries to take his sister back from Jizou but it holds on to her refusing to let go. Nyāko splits in two leaving Jizou with half of her soul while her brother runs away with the other half. Jizou sends a clue about a flower they must search for in order to retrieve the missing half-soul, then walks away with it.

Meanwhile, Nyatta's father finds his son in the bathtub and revives him. Then, all the family members gather in Nyāko's room to find out that she is dead. Nyatta gets closer with the half-soul in his arms and puts it back in his sister's body through her nose. Nyāko wakes up, but she remains despondent and semi-catatonic. After that Nyatta and Nyāko begin their journey (because their mother asks them to go and buy some fried tofu). During their outing they visit the 'Big Whale Circus', the final act of which is a giant penguin-looking bird "filled" with various weather, causes a flood of water which covers everything. The two of them end up on an Ark-esque boat with a pig, which they eventually begin to eat (by unzipping his stomach and pulling out butcher slabs). God drains the world of the oceans (by holding up the world so the water on it runs down his arm), leaving the cats and pig stranded in a desert. The pig is beaten to death and bites off Nyatta's arm, which is repaired by a desert-dweller who makes dolls from the pieces of other cats.

Traveling across the desert, they are brought to a house by the smell of food, and are invited inside by a man. They are fed, and when full the man attempts to turn them into soup, attacking them with a pair of scissors. He ends up falling into the cauldron, Nyatta cuts him into pieces with the scissors and the cats escape. Wandering further across the desert dehydrated, Nyatta digs and finds an elephant made of water, which cools them off and travels with them, though the elephant eventually evaporates from the heat. God accidentally stops the flow of time and disrupts space, and the cats play with the time-frozen scenes. Father Time turns time back on, shooting it forward and reversing it, showing various scenes of random events either rapidly going forth in time or back. Eventually the cats find themselves back on their boat in the ocean. They drift into a marsh of metallic plants and creatures, coming across the flower they were seeking. Nyatta places the flower on Nyākos face, which restores her to normal. Together, they go back home.

In the end, the entire family of cats are gathered in their house leisurely watching TV. Nyatta leaves them to visit the toilet, and while he is gone, the other family members disappear one by one into thin air. The show on the TV also disappears, leaving only a flashing screen behind. Nyatta returns to find everyone gone. Outside the nearby lamppost extinguishes leaving the house in darkness. Finally the movie also "turns off", leaving behind a flashing screen of static before the credits roll.

==Background==
The characters of Nyāko and Nyatta first appeared in the June 1990 issue of the monthly manga magazine [[Garo (magazine)|Garo]].  They also appeared in a series of 27 two-minute television episodes, collectively titled {{Nihongo|''[[Nekojiru Gekijō]]''|ねこぢる劇場|Nekojiru Theatre}}.  The series appeared in 1999 as a segment on [[TV Asahi]]'s {{Nihongo|''Bakushō-Mondai no Boss-Kyara-Ō''|爆笑問題のボスキャラ王}}.

Nekojiru (the artist) was born on January 19, 1967 and died by suicide on May 10, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoshinaga|first1=Yoshiaki|title=Yoshiaki Yoshinaga on Nekojiru - pt. 2|url=http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php/yoshiaki_yoshinaga_on_nekojiru_pt_2|website=Anipages|publisher=Benjamin Ettinger|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mag.awn.com/?article_no=1925&amp;ltype=acrmag|title=New from Japan: Anime Film Reviews|last=Patten|first=Fred|publisher=Animation World Magazine|date=November 21, 2003|accessdate=23 May 2009}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her actual name was {{Nihongo|Chiyomi Hashiguchi|橋口 千代美|Hashiguchi Chiyomi|née {{Nihongo|Nakayama|中山}}}}.

'''Cluttering''' (also called '''tachyphemia''' or '''tachyphrasia''') is a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[communication disorder]] characterized by a rapid rate of speech, erratic rhythm, and poor [[syntax]] or grammar, making speech difficult to understand.

==Classification==
Cluttering is a [[speech disorder|speech]] and [[communication disorder]] that has also been described as a [[fluency]] disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is defined as:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Cluttering is a fluency disorder characterized by a rate that is perceived to be abnormally rapid, irregular, or both for the speaker (although measured syllable rates may not exceed normal limits). These rate abnormalities further are manifest in one or more of the following symptoms: (a) an excessive number of [[disfluencies]], the majority of which are not typical of people with [[stuttering]]; (b) the frequent placement of pauses and use of [[prosodic|prosodic patterns]] that do not conform to [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] constraints; and (c) inappropriate (usually excessive) degrees of [[coarticulation]] among sounds, especially in multisyllabic words".&lt;ref&gt;St. Louis, K. O., Myers, F. L., Bakker, K., &amp; Raphael, L. J. (2007). Understanding and treating cluttering. In E. G. Conture &amp; R. F. Curlee (Eds.) Stuttering and related disorders of fluency, 3rd ed. (pp. 297-325). NY: Thieme.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[Stuttering]] is often misapplied as a common term referring to any dysfluency. It is also often incorrectly applied to normal dysfluency rather than dysfluency from a disorder.  Cluttered speech is exhibited by normal speakers, and is often referred to as stuttering. This is especially true when the speaker is nervous, where nervous speech more closely resembles cluttering than stuttering.

Cluttering is sometimes confused with stuttering. Both communication disorders break the normal flow of speech, but they are distinct. A stutterer has a coherent pattern of thoughts, but may have a difficult time vocally expressing those thoughts; in contrast, a clutterer has no problem putting thoughts into words, but those thoughts become disorganized during speaking. Cluttering affects not only speech, but also thought patterns, writing, typing, and conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html When speech is too cluttered - British Stammering Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151645/http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stutterers are usually dysfluent on initial sounds, when beginning to speak, and become more fluent towards the ends of utterances. In contrast, clutterers are most clear at the start of utterances, but their speaking rate increases and intelligibility decreases towards the end of utterances.

Stuttering is characterized by struggle behavior, such as overtense speech production muscles. Cluttering, in contrast, is effortless.  Cluttering is also characterized by [[Relaxed pronunciation|slurred speech]], especially dropped or distorted /r/ and /l/ sounds; and monotone speech that starts loud and trails off into a murmur.

A clutterer described the feeling associated with a clutter as:
{{cquote|It feels like 1) about twenty thoughts explode on my mind all at once, and I need to express them all, 2) that when I'm trying to make a point, that I just remembered something that I was supposed to say, so the person can understand, and I need to interrupt myself to say something that I should have said before, and 3) that I need to constantly revise the sentences that I'm working on, to get it out right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Differential diagnosis==
Cluttering can often be confused with [[language delay]], [[language disorder]], [[learning disabilities]], and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | page=233
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clutterers often have [[reading disabilities|reading]] and writing disabilities, especially sprawling, disorderly handwriting, which poorly integrate ideas and space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 Fluency Disorders: Stuttering vs Cluttering&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729022709/http://www.content.onlypunjab.com/Article/Fluency-Disorders--Stuttering-vs-Cluttering/4200320092003249120 |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Because clutterers have poor awareness of their disorder, they may be indifferent or even hostile to speech-language pathologists. [[Delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF) is usually used to produce a more deliberate, exaggerated oral-motor response pattern. Other treatment components include improving [[narrative structure]] with [[Storytelling|story-telling]] [[picture book]]s, turn-taking practice, pausing practice, and language therapy.

==History==
[[Battaros]] was a legendary [[Libya]]n king who spoke quickly and in a disorderly fashion.  Others who spoke as he did were said to suffer from ''battarismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the earliest record of the speech disorder of cluttering.

In the 1960s, cluttering was called ''tachyphemia'', a word derived from the Greek for "fast speech". This word is no longer used to describe cluttering because fast speech is not a required element of cluttering.

Deso Weiss described cluttering as the outward manifestation of a "central language imbalance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Society and culture==
Weiss claimed that Battaros, [[Demosthenes]], [[Pericles]], [[Justinian]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], and [[Winston Churchill]] were clutterers.  He says about these people, "Each of these contributors to [[World History|world history]] viewed his world holistically, and was not deflected by exaggerated attention to small details.

The '''Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar''', founded in the late 1970s, provides training for dealers in out-of-print, used, and antiquarian books.

==Origins==
The Seminar was the brainchild of Margaret Knox Goggin, on the faculty (and formerly dean) of the School of Librarianship at the [[University of Denver]]. The first session, held at the University in December 1977, was primarily intended for librarians who wished to improve their skills in buying used, out-of-print, and rare books.&lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 23, 1980, p. 4886.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five registrants heard lectures by Goggin, Jacob L. Chernofsky (Editor and Publisher of [[AB Bookman's Weekly]]), Lee Ash, and Harry U. Mooney (Collection Development Coordinator, [[Denver Public Library]]). The success of the venture encouraged Goggin and Chernofsky to offer an annual seminar beginning in 1979 on the out-of-print and antiquarian book market, "designed to help librarians throughout the country with a working knowledge of the out-of-print and antiquarian book trade and the role of that market in acquisitions procedures and collection development." &lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 18, 1980, p. 4664.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 50 students attended the 1979 Seminar, which was oriented toward the needs of librarians; nevertheless, "a half dozen booksellers also registered — pointing up the need for such a course for booksellers as well as librarians.” &lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' June 23, 1980 p. 4886.&lt;/ref&gt; Faculty members at the 1979 Seminar included the autograph dealer Mary A. Benjamin, Franklin Gilliam (Brick Row Book Shop, San Francisco), Edwin V. Glaser (a dealer specializing in rare medical books, based in Sausalito, CA), Katharine Kyes Leab (Editor of ''American Book Prices Current''), Murray S. Martin (Penn State), Bernard M. Rosenthal (a San Francisco-based dealer specializing in early printed books), and Florian Shasky (Stanford University Libraries).

==Early years==
The Seminar became an annual event held in August at the University of Denver under the co-directorship of Goggin and Chernofsky, its title settling down as "A Workshop-Seminar on the Out-of-Print and Antiquarian Book Market for Booksellers and Librarians," designed "to meet the needs of acquisitions librarians, those responsible for developing collections, rare book librarians, as well as booksellers and prospective booksellers.".&lt;ref&gt;''AB Bookman's Weekly,'' 23 June 1980, pp. 4886-89; July 7, 1980, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The Seminar lecturers varied somewhat from year to year, but a core faculty emerged that included, besides Jake Chernofsky and Margaret Goggin, Michael Ginsberg (an Americana dealer based in Sharon, MA), Ed Glaser, Robert W. Topp (Hermitage Book Shop, Denver), and [[Jake Zeitlin]] (Zeitlin &amp; Ver Brugge, Los Angeles). Other stalwart faculty members were to include Mary Francis Ciletti, Lois Harvey, Jennifer Larson, Jean Parmer, and Richard Weatherford. Though there were always a few librarians in attendance, by the mid-1980s, the typical Seminar student was a used, out-of-print, or rare bookseller (or someone who wished to become one).

==Success==
The Seminar was soon attracting over 100 registrants annually. It ran extra sessions at the University of Florida in March 1988 and March 1994, in addition to the annual sessions in Colorado each August. Its success was chronicled in a series of annual articles by ''AB Bookman's Weekly'''s Associate Editor, Rebecca Myers, often titled with some variant of "Book is a four-letter word."&lt;ref&gt;"Antiquarian Book Seminar Entering Its 2nd Decade," May 29, 1989, pp. 2397-2402; "Antiquarian Book Seminar Launches Second Decade," May 28, 1990; "Where the Favorite Four-Letter Word is Book," June 24, 1991, pp. 2619-24 and May 11, 1992, 1929-32; "Sharing the Fingerspitzengefuehl," May 17, 1993, pp. 2091-94; "Where the Favorite Four-Letter Word is Book," May 16, 1994, pp. 2155-58 and Jan 9, 1995, pp. 9=-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1985, a keynote speaker began the proceedings on Sunday night. Notable keynoters included John Y. Cole (1985; [[Center for the Book]], [[Library of Congress]]); Marcus A. McCorison (1987; Director and Librarian, [[American Antiquarian Society]]); Robert Rosenthal (1989; head of special collections, [[University of Chicago]]); and Louis Weinstein (1999; Heritage Book Shop, Los Angeles). By the late 1980s, the Seminar had established a tradition of asking a different specialist dealer to join the faculty each year: Diane deBlois in 1988 (aGatherin', Wynanskill, NY; printed ephemera); Patterson Smith in 1990 (Montclair, NJ; true crime); John Crichton in 1991 (Brick Row Book Shop, San Francisco: literature); Priscilla Juvelis in 1996 (Boston; artists' books); and so on.

==Transition Years==
Margaret Knox Goggin stepped down as co-director of the Seminar after the 1994 Gainesville and Colorado Seminars, and the Denver connection weakened. The 1993 Seminar was hosted by the Colorado School of Mines in Golden; in 1995 the Seminar moved to [[Colorado College]], in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] (where it has been, ever since). Chernofsky continued as director, with Jennifer Larson as unnamed co-director; but in the later 1990s his magazine, [[AB Bookman's Weekly]], was faltering, unable to cope with the rise of internet bookselling; ''AB'' ceased publication in 1999, and Chernofsky sold the Seminar to faculty members Michael Ginsberg, Edwin Glaser, Lois Harvey, and Jennifer Larson (later, Daniel De Simone and Robert Rulon-Miller, Jr. jointly purchased a 1/5 share of the Seminar from the other shareholders). The Seminar was slow to refocus its presentations on what students most wanted to learn: more about researching and pricing used general-interest books; more about selling on eBay and the internet; less about older and more valuable antiquarian books. Attendance declined; by 2004, the average number of participants had fallen to well under 50.

==CABS Becomes a 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Corporation==
The Seminar reinvigorated itself in the mid-2000s, with faculty additions [[Terry Belanger]], Thomas E. Congalton (Between the Covers Rare Books, Gloucester City, NJ), Daniel De Simone (Rosenwald Curator, Library of Congress), internet specialist Dan Gregory (Between the Covers), [[Kevin Royal Johnson]] (Royal Books, Baltimore), and Robert Rulon-Miller, Jr. (Rulon-Miller Books, St Paul, MN) joining Seminar stalwarts Ginsberg and Glaser. Participant response was enthusiastic,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, comments by Kenny Parolini, https://web.archive.org/web/20080704124325/http://ioba.org/newsletter/archive/7%282%29/toolbox2.php, accessed 2011-11-01; by Maria Hutchison, http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2007/08/08/update-from-the-colorado-antiquarian-book-seminar, accessed 2011-11-01; and by Joel Perlman (in the newsletter of the Independent Online Booksellers Association, http://ioba.org/standard/2011/06/2009-colorado-antiquarian-book-seminar-cabs-journal-or-teaching-an-old-dog-some-new-tricks/, accessed 2011-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and attendance began to climb. The Seminar's title was given its present form: Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar (CABS) and a new [http://www.bookseminars.com website], and the proprietors relinquished their shares to a tax-exempt, not-for-profit corporation called the Antiquarian Book School Foundation. The current director of CABS is Rob Rulon-Miller and the current local coordinator at [[Colorado College]] is Kathy Lindeman; the chairman of the Foundation's board is Rob Rulon-Miller. The ongoing faculty comprises bookseller Lorne W. Bair (Winchester, VA); Terry Belanger (Charlottesville, VA); Brian Cassidy (Silver Spring, MD), Maria Lin (Saint Paul, MN); Katherine Reagan (Curator ofRare Books and Manuscripts, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), Rob Rulon-Miller (Saint Paul, MN) and Garrett Scott (Ann Arbor, MI).

Since 1980, nearly 3,000 persons have attended the Seminar, which throughout its existence has had the strong support of the [[Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America]] (ABAA): CABS board and faculty members over the years have included ABAA Presidents Thomas E. Congalton, Edwin V. Glaser, Michael Ginsberg, Bernard M. Rosenthal, Robert Rulon-Miller Jr, John Thomson, and others. In recent years, scholarships to CABS have been provided not only by ABAA (Woodburn Scholarships) but also by [[AbeBooks]], [[Biblio.com]], Bibliopolis, IOBA [[Independent Online Booksellers Association]], and the Rocky Mountain Antiquarian Booksellers Association (RMABA) as well as by the faculty themselves. Most of the current attendees are booksellers (or prospective booksellers), but librarians and book collectors sometimes attend, as well.

Now in its 40th year, the Colorado Antiquarian Book Seminar is the oldest, continuously operated educational institution in the world for the antiquarian book trade, predating Rare Book School in Virginia, which was partially modeled on the Colorado Seminar, by nearly five years. Of the nearly 3,000 or so graduates of the Seminar, a remarkably high percentage of them are still involved in books, either as booksellers, librarians, and/or collectors.

The '''conservation and restoration of parchment''' constitutes the care and treatment of [[parchment]] materials which have cultural and historical significance. Typically undertaken by professional [[Conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera|book and document conservators]], this process can include preventative measures which protect against future deterioration as well as specific treatments to alleviate changes already caused by agents of deterioration.  

==Parchment manufacturing and properties==
[[File:Perkament fabricage-516117.ogv|thumb|left|The making of parchment in the Netherlands]]
[[Parchment]] is the skin of an animal, usually sheep, calf or goat, which has been dehaired, processed with a lime solution and stretched under tension. The dried material is a thin membrane which is most commonly used as a writing surface, but can also be used to make other items like [[bookbinding]]s and [[drumhead]]s. Throughout Europe, parchment was the primary writing substrate from its development in the 2nd century BCE through the [[Middle Ages]], though it is used through the present day for various official documents. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whymark|first1=Francesca|title=Is not parchment made of sheepskins? Ay, my lord, and of calfskins too...|url=http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/collectioncare/2013/09/parchment-conservation-lyte-geneaology.html|website=British Library Collection Care Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically parchment made from calfskin is called [[vellum]], though the term can also be used to refer to very fine quality parchment made from the skins of other animals. For the purposes of conservation and restoration, the term parchment is used in reference to vellum objects, as the terms have been used interchangeably throughout time to refer to objects with the same conservation concerns. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parchment Treatments|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/pcc/18_parchment.pdf|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parchment has unique structural qualities which differentiate it from paper-based materials. Typically, parchment is resistant to mechanical damage like tears or creasing, though it is easily susceptible to damage from mold and high temperatures.&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt; Parchment is also highly [[hygroscopic]] in nature, meaning that changes in [[relative humidity]] can cause irreversible variations to its structural makeup. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for your collections: Parchment documents|url=http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/276234/Caring-for-your-collections-Parchment-documents.pdf|website=State Library of Queensland|accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These specific qualities dictate the conservation and restoration treatments required for parchment. 

===Physical and chemical properties===
Most skins used for parchment are between 1 – 3 mm in thickness before processing. Animal skin used for parchment all has the same basic structure, with slight variations due to the species, age and diet of the specific animal. Skin is composed of innumerable fibrils made up of the protein [[collagen]], which are held in bundles that interweave in a three dimensional manner through the skin.  The fibrous material is composed of many long chain molecules of collagen, which can react with certain environmental factors. One universal property of collagen is that it exhibits sudden shrinkage when heated in water, starting at 65&amp;#176;C. Prolonged exposure to alkali, like in parchment liming process, changes the amino acids, consequently dropping shrinkage temperatures as low as 55&amp;#176;C. 
&lt;ref name="Betty Haines"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haines|first1=Betty|title=Parchment|publisher=Leather Conservation Center|isbn=9780946072057}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Manufacturing===
Once it is removed from the animal, the skin is temporarily preserved, either by drying or liberal application of salt, until it can be processed. The skin is then immersed in water for 48 hours, which cleans and rehydrates it. This step also removes the non-collagenous materials, like [[hyaluronic acid]], [[dermaten sulphate]] and [[plasma proteins]]. The skin is then soaked in a lime or [[alkali]] solution, known as the [[Liming (leather processing)|liming]] process.&lt;ref name="Betty Haines" /&gt; In the 19th century, chemicals were added to speed up the liming process, which resulted in weaker parchments. These added compounds sometimes reacted to produce gypsum, giving the parchment a characteristic gray hue.&lt;ref name="NEDCC" /&gt; The skin is then stretched in suspension on a frame, constricting it as it dries. This ensures even contraction across the entire parchment which ensures that it will remain flat when dried. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hingley|first1=Mark|title=Success in the Treatment of Parchment and Vellum using a Suction Table|journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists|date=2001|volume=22|issue=1|doi=10.1080/00379810120037513}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being prepared, parchment is sometimes coated so that it is more receptive to pigment and ink. Historical coatings, which include chalk, egg whites and matte paint, must be taken into consideration as a meaningful part of the preservation and conservation plan.&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt; 

The manufacturing process, which removes the skin's natural fats and oils, means that parchment is more reactive to moisture and relative humidity than other skin-based material. After being stretched, parchment has an inherent desire to revert to its original animal shape, especially if left unrestrained or exposed to repeated changes in relative humidity.&lt;ref name="Sackville manuscript"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxtable|first1=Merryl|title=Tethering the cow – Treatment and display of the Sackville Pedigree – a large 16th century heraldic parchment manuscript|journal=Conservation Journal|date=Autumn 2002|issue=42|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-42/tethering-the-cowtreatment-and-display-of-the-sackville-pedigreea-large-16th-century-heraldic-parchment-manuscript/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===
Parchment is usually positively identified by sight, sometimes with the assistance of a [[hand lens]] or [[microscope]]. Visible hair follicle pattern, veining, scars, bruises and sometimes fat deposits all help confirm the animal origin of the material. Additional light sources including [[ultraviolet]] lights, can make these properties more easily identifiable. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parchment|url=https://www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/librarypreservation/mee/preservation/parchment.html|website=Library Preservation and Conservation|publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes visual examination is not sufficient to distinguish parchment from certain types of highly [[calender]]ed papers. Misidentification of these materials can lead to inappropriate preservation methods or conservation treatments.&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt; Analytical testing, which involves removing a small piece of parchment, can be done by or under the supervision of a professional conservator-restorer to ensure positive identification. One type of analytical testing involves examining the parchment specimen under a [[light microscope]] or [[scanning electron microscopy]]. A simple flame test can also be done on the parchment specimen; true parchment will emit the meaty smell of burned protein, while other look-alike materials will smell like paper or wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Jack|title=Identifying Parchment|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byform/mailing-lists/cdl/2002/0610.html|website=Conservation OnLine DistList}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agents of deterioration==

*'''Relative humidity changes''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansen, Lee &amp; Sobel|title=THE EFFECTS OF RELATIVE HUMIDITY ON SOME PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MODERN VELLUM:|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|date=1991|volume=33|issue=3|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic31-03-005.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Changes in [[relative humidity]] can cause parchment to change shape, especially if movement is restrained by a frame or mount at certain parts of the object, which leads to uneven distortion. This distortion can result in cockling and destabilization of any pigments affixed to the parchment.&lt;ref name="Single leaf parchment"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norman|first1=Daniel|title=The mounting of single leaf parchment &amp; vellum objects for display and storage|journal=Conservation Journal|date=October 1993|issue=09|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-09/the-mounting-of-single-leaf-parchment-and-vellum-objects-for-display-and-storage/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low humidity levels can cause parchment to [[Desiccation|desiccate]]. &lt;ref name="PSAP" /&gt;
*'''Water and excessive moisture'''
Direct water contact and excessive moisture in the environment can cause structural problems for parchment including: expansion of object; discoloration; alteration of surface coatings; gelatinization of skin; and realignment of fibers. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;
*'''Oxygen'''
Atmospheric oxygen reacts with the chemical composition of parchment, which subsequently changes the physical properties of the object over time. &lt;ref name="Oxygen-Free" /&gt;
*'''Mold'''
Mold is a probable consequence of water damage to parchment, especially when the object is not dried within 48 hours of the initial contact with water. &lt;ref name="Drying methods - NARA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaplan &amp; Ludwig|title=Efficacy of Various Drying Methods|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/conservation/drying-methods-01.html|website=Archives.gov|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Heat:'''
Heat in excess of the ideal storage conditions can cause damage to collagen structure, irreversible contraction and alteration of surface materials in parchment objects. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;
*'''Light exposure'''
Lower wavelength and [[ultraviolet]] light lead to degradation of the collagen structure and photodiscoloration, usually causing yellowing of parchment.&lt;ref name="Betty Haines" /&gt; Parchment exposed to UV light can also have a photochemical reaction causing it to become brittle.&lt;ref name="NEDCC"&gt;{{cite web|title=INHERENT VICe: Materials|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-4/2inherent-vice-materials#parchment|website=NEDCC|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Flaking and friability:'''
Consolidation of media on parchment, such as those found in [[Conservation and restoration of illuminated manuscripts#inks and pigments|illuminated manuscripts]], is compromised by the instability of the parchment substrate. Excessive flexing or chemical changes in the parchment can lead to loss of pigment and text. &lt;ref name="Quandt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quandt|first1=Abigail|title=Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts|journal=The Book and Paper Group Annual|date=1996|volume=15|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-14.html|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Poor storage'''
Parchment which has been adhered to a rigid mount for storage or display is unable to expand and contract, as its natural tendency. This poor storage technique can lead to tears, perforations and loss. Parchment stored in an unregulated and inconsistent environment is more susceptible to damage. &lt;ref name="PSAP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parchment|url=https://psap.library.illinois.edu/format-id-guide/parchment|website=Preservation Self-Assessment Program|publisher=University of Illinois Libraries|accessdate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage and Preventative Care==
Proper storage environments can help ward off structural, chemical and environmental changes which affects the long-term preservation of parchment. Storage factors must take into account the factors of the particular parchment object, including its condition, age, storage history and plans for use. [[Conservation and restoration of illuminated manuscripts|Illuminated manuscripts]] and composite parchment objects, which may include [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] and ribbons, may have additional storage needs.&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt; A consistent storage environment is crucial for the long-term stability of parchment, which is especially vulnerable to changes in humidity, temperature and other environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Single leaf parchment" /&gt; 

Microenvironments are less expensive ways to provide consistent storage environments for parchment if the external storage conditions are not ideal. Moisture sensitive parchments can be stored in a [[Plexiglas]] sandwich by inserting the matted parchment between two sheets of acrylic and taping off all sides. Parchment can also be stored in envelopes constructed out of [[polyester]] sheets. &lt;ref name="Garside Microenvironments"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garside &amp; Walker|title=The Formation of Microenvironments in Polyester Enclosures|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies|volume=13|issue=1|url=http://www.jcms-journal.com/articles/10.5334/jcms.1021223/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the long-term preservation of organic material like parchment, the ideal temperature range is 10-15&amp;#176;C with a [[relative humidity]] level of 30-50%. The ideal storage and display environment is oxygen-free, as oxygen prevalence has been shown to react with collagen over time, leading to increased brittleness of parchment. Oxygen-free storage and display cases are filled with [[inert gas]] as well as a chemical substance that reacts as an absorber if any stray oxygen leaks into the encasement. &lt;ref name="Oxygen-Free"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maekawa|first1=Shin|title=Oxygen-Free Museum Cases|publisher=The Getty Institute|isbn=0-89236-529-3|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/oxygenfree.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical concerns of conservation==
All conservation and restoration treatments of parchment objects should follow the conduct set forth in [[American Institute for Conservation]]'s Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice#.VxrIGUdTLAo]. The hazards of specific treatments need to be weighed against the benefits, as many traditional liquid-based conservation techniques can pose risks to parchment.

==Conservation treatments==
===Removal of previous restorations===
Previous repairs and conservation treatments are removed if it is determined that the parchment is in good condition and that the repair is not of historic importance to the parchment. Dried out patches are removed via cleaning and humidification techniques. Parchment objects that have been attached to mounts are removed with a sharpened lifting tool and a small amount of moisture. Previous laminations, like [[Goldbeater's skin]] and Mipofolie, can sometimes be removed with solvents and mechanical techniques, though this removal technique can risk additional damage to the original parchment. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;

===Cleaning===
Surface cleaning of parchment has been developed after methods used for cleaning paper, with a few key differences related to the structural and chemical properties of parchment.  For the most part, chemical treatments are ineffective and some, like hypochlorites and [[methyl bromide]], can [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturalize]] parchment. Prior to cleaning, any flaking or vulnerable media is [[Conservation_and_restoration_of_illuminated_manuscripts#Consolidation|consolidated]] to ensure it does not detach from the parchment substrate. Consolidation of parchment media is undertaken by applying various dilute adhesives like isinglass, gelatin or parchment size through brush application or by the use of an ultrasonic humidifcation apparatus.  

If their presence is determined upon examination, insects and pests are eliminated and the parchment disinfected. An appropriate round of [[fumigation]] in an [[autoclave]] is used to remove pests and sterilize the object. Dry and wet cleaning techniques can both be used effectively on parchment objects. Mechanical cleaning using erasers and other abrasive tools is used to remove mildew and dirt. Surface cleaning of parchment is typically completed using white vinyl erasers (solid and grated) and confined to areas where no media is present. Water baths, which sometimes use neutral detergents or alcohol as additives, can be used to clean as well as prepare the parchment for stretching as part of the conservation process. &lt;ref name="RAMP Study"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vinas|title=Traditional restoration techniques: a RAMP study|date=1988|publisher=UNESCO|location=Paris|url=http://www.unesco.org/webworld/ramp/html/r8817e/r8817e09.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another wet cleaning method, which is especially useful for removing mold and mildew, uses a cotton swab covered in fluid, usually [[denatured alcohol]], ethanol or saliva. [[Laser]] cleaning may provide a non-contact cleaning process, though conservation labs throughout Europe still mostly use traditional wet and dry cleaning methods for parchment.&lt;ref name="Laser cleaning Vest"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vest|first1=Marie|title=Critical evaluation of laser cleaning of parchment documents|journal=Conservation Journal|date=Spring 2002|volume=40|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-40/critical-evaluation-of-laser-cleaning-of-parchment-documents/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humidification===
Humidification is a parchment conservation treatment which involves the controlled and monitored increase in relative humidity. Humidified parchments are more flexible, which will allow for corrections to distortions like cockling, puckering and changes in original size. Some methods of humidification are: humidification chambers: moisture chambers with ultrasonic [[humidifier]], moisture chambers with steam/ultrasonic mist; and application of alcohol and water. Localized humidification is sometimes used to treat specific folds or creases in parchment objects. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;

===Flattening, tensioning and drying=== 
After humidification, drying techniques are necessary to ensure that the parchment lays flat and does not suffer additional moisture-related issues. The specific method is dependent on the condition of the object, as well as the humidification process utilized. Some of the most common methods include:
*Drying and flattening under pressure, often pressed between two absorbent surfaces
*Tensioning at the edges, where the parchment is constricted at the edges with weights or clips. This techniques most closely reflects parchment's original manufacturing process.
*Stretch drying on [[Polyethylene terephthalate|Terylene]]
*Vacuum suction table flattening&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;

Localized creases are eased with a solution of 80% to 90% [[isopropyl alcohol]] and water, which is applied to the creases directly with a cotton swab and then gently pulled flat by hand. The Alcohol-Water mixture is [[azeotropic]], meaning both components evaporate simultaneously. The solution has a lower surface tension than just water, which causes the fibers to suffer less shrinkage.&lt;ref name=woods1995&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00379819509511780|author=Woods, Chris|year=1995|title= Conservation Treatments for Parchment Documents|journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists|volume=16|issue =2|pages=221–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mending and in-filling losses===
Sewing tears is not recommended as a conservation treatment, unless it is replacing a sewn portion original to the object. Correcting non-original splits, tears, perforations and losses in parchment requires careful consideration of its specific condition. For losses that don't require much support, transparent membranes, such as fish skin or sausage casing, are placed over the damaged area with an adhesive. Infill materials, including new parchment, reconstituted parchment and [[Washi|Japanese paper]], are used to repair losses requiring greater structural support. All infill materials have some conservation concerns, as they will react differently  to environmental factors than the original parchment. 
*New parchment: It is difficult to match the infill material to the original parchment type in terms of animal, thickness and appearance. Modern parchments that appear visually similar also respond differently to humidity fluctuations, causing potential problems after the conservation treatment. Parchment infills are matched by thinning them to the appropriate size and [[Bevel|bevelling]] the original parchment before the repair.
*Japanese paper: Paper is dissimilar to parchment in both appearance and behavior, which can pose the future issue of storing an object with composite materials. Paper infills can be toned with watercolor or [[acrylic paints]] to better match the original parchment appearance. Acrylic-toned papers are treated with various adhesives such as B-72, Aquazol, or PVA to mimic the translucency of the surrounding parchment. Varying layers of application are used to best approximate the thickness and condition of the specific original parchment.&lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;
*Reconstituted parchment: Collagen fibers and dry [[cellulose]] materials are mixed together with liquid ingredients to create a [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]]-like substance. This material is applied to the original parchment in a process similar to [[leafcasting]] paper.&lt;ref name="Reconstituted parchment fill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wikarski, Eyb-Green &amp; Baatz|title=Filling in Losses in Parchment Bound Volumes – Part I: Assessment of Parchment and Paper Fibres in Reconstituted Parchment|journal=Restaurator|date=2015|volume=36|issue=1|pages=25-46|url=http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle.fullcontentlink:pdfeventlink/$002fj$002frest.2015.36.issue-1$002fres-2014-0103$002fres-2014-0103.pdf?format=INT&amp;t:ac=j$002frest.2015.36.issue-1$002fres-2014-0103$002fres-2014-0103.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disaster Recovery===
Parchment which has been accidentally exposed to excess moisture or water is extremely susceptible to mold, mechanical damage and irreversible dimensional changes. Emergencies often affect large quantities of objects, therefore the mass treatment of objects usually includes freezing or [[freeze-drying]] as the first step. As time permits, parchment object are then thawed and dried using more traditional measures. &lt;ref name="18 Parchment Treatments" /&gt;

==Case Studies==

===Charters of Freedom===
The United States [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], collectively known as the Charters of Freedom, were housed in metal and glass encasements, filled with [[helium]] gas, from 1952 to 2001. In 1951, the [[National Bureau of Standards]] reported that an inert gas environment would be the best means of preserving the Charters of Freedom.  &lt;ref name="Oxygen-Free" /&gt; In 1982, the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] partnered with the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] on a 9-year project which determined that the encasement glass was deteriorating. Upon the issuing of this report, it was decided that new encasements and conservation treatments were needed for the long-term preservation of the Charters of Freedom. The documents were thoroughly examined for signs of deterioration and past restorations, all of which were thoroughly documented in condition reports. 

The first step of treatment stabilized the ink of the text using a gelatin adhesive. The dirt and grime were then cleaned from the parchments, though original intentional marks were left alone. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were then humidified and dried under tension to flatten the parchments. The Declaration of Independence, which has been damaged by frequent handling and exposure, was not humidified because of its increased moisture sensitivity. All the parchments were then installed into new titanium and aluminum encasements, developed by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], which are filled with inert [[argon]] gas. The current environmental conditions of the Charters of Freedom encasements is monitored by scientists and conservators for signs of possible deterioration agents. &lt;ref name="NARA Charters"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ritzenthaler &amp; Nicholson|title=A New Era Begins for the Charters of Freedom|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_preservation_02.html|website=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canterbury Magna Carta===
In 1731, one of four surviving copies of the 1215 [[Magna Carta]], known as the Canterbury Magna Carta, was partially damaged in a fire at its temporary storage location at [[Ashburnham House]]. Damage included shrinkage and discoloration of the parchment substrate, though the ink text was still legible. In the 1830s, [[British Museum]] staff attempted a restoration, using chemicals to treat the parchment and unintentionally rendering the text illegible. 

In 2014, the [[British Library]] undertook a [[Multispectral image|multispectral imaging]] project to determine if the text on the damaged document could be recovered. Analysis under [[ultraviolet]] light allowed scientists and conservators to see text that was invisible to the naked eye. This new technology allows the document to be used for continued research purposes, despite the previous botched restoration.&lt;ref name="Magna Carta conservation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Christina|title=Revealing the secrets of the burnt Magna Carta|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/revealing-the-secrets-of-the-burnt-magna-carta|website=British Library|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4640">The term '''Context art''' ({{lang-de|Kontext Kunst}}) was introduced through the seminal exhibition and an accompanying publication ''Kontext Kunst. The Art of the 90s''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuegalerie-archiv.at/93/kunst/cover.html Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; curated by [[Peter Weibel]] at the Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Graz (Austria) in 1993 (02.10.–07.11.1993).

== Exhibition and publication ==

Both exhibition and publication aimed to establish grounds for recognizing a new form of artistic practice emerging in the early 1990s. The presentation displayed different approaches though all shared an interest in the use of methods of contextualization to reveal connections between the art works and their conditions of production, whether these were formal, social, or ideologically defined. Institutional critique, feminist positions, later also critiques of precarious economic conditions and issues of globalization, all closely related to social and political changes, became relevant subjects of artistic production.

“It is no longer purely about critiquing the art system, but about critiquing reality and analyzing and creating social processes. In the ’90s, non-art contexts are being increasingly drawn into the art discourse. Artists are becoming autonomous agents of social processes, partisans of the real. The interaction between artists and social situations, between art and non-art contexts has led to a new art form, where both are folded together: Context art. The aim of this social construction of art is to take part in the social construction of reality.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shiftyparadigms.org/false_economies.htm Peter Weibel, Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre (Köln: DuMont Verlag, 1994), p. 57, translated by Barnaby Drabble / resource: Rebecca Gordon Nesbitt, ''False Economies: Time to Take Stock'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

It might be due to the fact that the term was introduced under the German translation ''[[KontextKunst]]'' instead of ''Context Art'' or its likewise politically tended orientation (see Maria Lind’s reference&lt;ref&gt;[http://eipcp.net/transversal/1204/lind/en/#_ftn16 Actualisation of Space: The Case of Oda Projesi]''Kontextkunst'' is, if you wish a German parallel to the so-called 'relational aesthetics' but more programmatically political and academic. Both imply a more dynamic notion of art, which actively takes the context into consideration and which often goes beyond the exhibition space. Some of the artists used as 'good' examples by Christian Kravagna have been associated with Kontextkunst.

Instead vaguely similar strategies were labeled as ''Models of Participatory Practice''&lt;ref&gt;[http://republicart.net/disc/aap/kravagna01_en.htm Working on the Community Models of Participatory Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998 by Christian Kravagna’s attempt to define the field or the later appearing and quite moderate [[Relational Art]] based on the 2002 book ''[[Relational Aesthetics]]'' by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]].

'''''Cupid Making His Bow''''' (c. 1533–1535) is a painting by the Italian late [[Renaissance]] artist [[Parmigianino]]. It is housed in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]],  [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].

==History==
The work appears in the inventory of Francesco Baiardo in [[Parma]], who was a friend and patron of  Parmigianino. Late Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] writes that Baiardo had commissioned the '' Cupido che fabbrica di sua mano un arco''.&lt;ref name=DiGiam&gt;{{cite book|first=Mario |last=Di Giampaolo |author2=Elisabetta Fadda|title=Parmigianino|publisher= Keybook|location=[[Sant'Arcangelo di Romagna]]|year=2002|isbn=88-18-02236-9|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was inherited by  Marcantonio Cavalca and later went to  Antonio Pérez, secretary of state of [[Philip II of Spain]], who brought it with him to [[Spain]]. In 1579 Pérez fell in disgrace, and was forced to sell the painting to an envoy of emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. It was however blocked by the Spanish crown, and could be acquired and arrive to [[Prague]], together with [[Correggio]]'s ''[[Jupiter and Io]] '' and ''[[Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle]]'', in 1603. It was transferred to Vienna's Schatzkammer in 1631.&lt;ref name=DiGiam/&gt;

A preparatory drawing for Cupid's head is in the [[Cabinet des Dessins]] of the [[Louvre]] (n. 1662). The work was frequently copied and used as a model by numerous artists. There are copies by [[Joseph Heintz the Elder]] and [[Rubens]] in the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of [[Munich]].&lt;ref name=DiGiam/&gt;

The '''Dominican Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Dominicano}}, PD) was the ''[[de facto]]'' [[One-party state|only political party]] in the [[Dominican Republic]] during the dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo]], who ruled the country from 1930 to 1961. Its symbol was a [[Arecaceae|palm tree]].

== History ==
The Dominican Party was founded on 2 August 1931, a year after Trujillo came to power. It was an outgrowth of the "Patriotic Coalition of Citizens" that supported Trujillo's run for president. Soon afterward, it was proclaimed to be the only legal party.

On 16 August 1935, the HIN radio station, known as "The Voice of the Dominican Party", was opened. It was dedicated to serving as the media propagator of the activities of the Dominican Party.

The insignia of the Party had a motto that coincided with Trujillo's initials:

*'''R'''ectitud (Righteousness) = Rafael
*'''L'''ibertad (Freedom; Liberty) = Leonidas
*'''T'''rabajo (Work; Labour; Job) = Trujillo.

Later, he added: '''M'''oralidad (Morality) = Molina.

Officially, Trujillo was only president from 1930 until 1938 and from 1942 until 1952, and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1953 until 1961.  However, for 30 years he held the real power as leader of the Dominican Party and [[Generalissimo]] of the [[Dominican Army]]. In these roles, he was able to ensure that when he was not actually president, the position was held by family members or politicians allied to him: [[Jacinto Peynado]] (President from 1938 until 1940), [[Manuel de Jesús Troncoso de la Concha]] (President from 1940 until 1942), his brother [[Héctor Trujillo|Hector]] (President from 1952 until 1960), and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] (took office as president in 1960; was president at the time of Trujillo's death). In this way, for the 31 years of his rule, he was able to maintain all governing power in the nation while appearing to be honorable and only hold power for 18 years.

All adult citizens of the Dominican Republic were required to be members of the party. They needed to carry "[the] three strikes" ({{lang-es|"los tres golpes"}})

*Personal Identity Card
*Compulsory Military Service Card
*Dominican Party Membership Card, popularly known as "La Palmita"

The party had no real ideology other than support for Trujillo.  It lingered for a brief time after Trujillo's assassination in 1961.  However, it was apparent there was no place for the party in the more open society, and it was finally wound up in January 1962.

At various times, Trujillo allowed other political parties to coexist.  However, this was done only to impress foreign observers that democratization was progressing, and to allow Trujillo to monitor opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Crassweller RD |title=Trujillo.

{{Feminism sidebar}}
The '''feminist art movement''' refers to the efforts and accomplishments of [[feminism|feminists]] internationally to produce [[feminist art|art that reflects women's lives and experiences]], as well as to change the foundation for the production and reception of contemporary art. It also sought to bring more visibility to women within [[art history]] and art practice. Corresponding with general developments within [[feminism]], and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s as an outgrowth of the so-called [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]]. It has been called "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/20/AR2007042000400.html Jeremy Strick], director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in the ''Washington Post'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 1960s was period of civil rights and [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay and lesbian rights]] movements and protests against war. It was also a period when women artists wanted to gain equal rights as men within the established art world, influenced by modernist movements "utopian ideals," and to create [[feminist art]], often in non-traditional ways, to help "change the world."&lt;ref name="Art Story"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-feminist-art.htm# | title=Feminist art movement | publisher=The Art Story Foundation | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louise Bourgeois]] (1911-2010) and German-American [[Eva Hesse]] (1936-1970) explore some of the themes in [[feminist art]], like domestic life, personal experience and the women's body.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

On 20 July 1964 [[Yoko Ono]], an avant-garde artist, singer, and activist, presented ''Cut Piece'' at the Yamaichi Concert Hall, Kyoto, Japan where she sat still as parts of her clothing were cut off of her, which meant to protest violence against women. She performed it again at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="CBS Yoko Ono"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/crowd-cuts-yoko-onos-clothing-off/ | title=Crowd Cuts Yoko Ono's Clothing Off | work=CBS News | date=16 October 2003 | accessdate=12 January 2014 | author=Jarett Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son, Sean, participated in the artist performance on 15 September 2013 at the Théâtre le Ranelagh in Paris.  ''[[The Guardian]]'''s Jonathan Jones considered it "one of the 10 most shocking performance artworks ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/11/scrotum-top-10-shocking-performance-art | title=The 10 most shocking performance artworks ever | publisher=The Guardian | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=12 January 2014 | author=Jonathan Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women artists, motivated by [[feminist theory]] and the [[feminist movement]], began the feminist art movement in the 1970s. Feminist art represented a shift away from [[modernism]], where art made by women was put in a different class to works made by men. The movement cultivated a new feminist consciousness, a "freedom to respond to life... [Unimpeded] by traditional male mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;Deoritha Anne Waters, Three Feminist Perspectives on Visual Media: Influences of the Second Wave Feminist Movement on Women’s Art Education and Their Lives as Artists, ed. Deoritha Anne Waters (Michigan: ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2014), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Or, as Griselda Pollock and Roszika Parker put it—a separation of Art with a capital "A" from art made by women produced a "feminine stereotype".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roszika Parker|author2=Griselda Pollock| title=Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideology |publisher=Pandora, RKP|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This demand for equality in representation was codified in the [[Art Workers' Coalition]]'s (AWC) Statement of Demands, which was developed in 1969 and published in definitive form in March 1970. The AWC was set up to defend the rights of artists and force museums and galleries to reform their practices. While the coalition sprung up as a protest movement following Greek kinetic sculptor [[Takis|Panagiotis "Takis" Vassilakis]]'s physical removal of his work Tele-Sculpture(1960) from a 1969 exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, it quickly issued a broad list of demands to 'art museums in general'.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Alongside calls for free admission, better representation of ethnic minorities, late openings and an agreement that galleries would not exhibit an artwork without the artist's consent, the AWC also demanded that museums 'encourage female artists to overcome centuries of damage done to the image of the female as an artist by establishing equal representation of the sexes in exhibitions, museum purchases and on selection committees'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Charles|title=Art in theory|date=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0-631-16575-4|pages=901–2|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also feminist forms of [[postmodernism]] which emerged in the 1980s. The feminist art movement grew out of the struggle to find a new way to express sexual, material, social and political aspects of life, and femininity.&lt;ref name="Kramarae pp. 92-93"&gt;Entry on feminist art practice by Katy Deepwell in {{cite book|editor1=Cheris Kramarae|editor2=Dale Spender|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfrzBcycB-4C&amp;pg=PA92|date=1 December 2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-92088-9|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist art movements emerged in [[Feminist art movement in the United States|the United States]];  Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gislind Nabakowski|author2=Peter Gorsen|author3=Sander Helke| title=Frauen in der Kunst(2 Vols.)|publisher=Frankfurt,Suhrkamp|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Spain;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mav.org.es/cronologiaMAV/cronologia.html  Mujeres en les Artes Visuales, Women in the Visual Arts, Spanish chronology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian feminist art timeline|Australia]]; Canada;&lt;ref&gt;Marie  Rose Arbour  ''Art et Feminisme'' Exhibition catalogue.

'''Garbage Pail Kids''' is a series of [[sticker]] [[trading card]]s produced by the [[Topps|Topps Company]], originally released in 1985 and designed to [[parody]] the ''[[Cabbage Patch Kids]]'' dolls which were popular at the time.

Each sticker card features a Garbage Pail Kid character having some comical abnormality, deformity, and/or suffering a terrible fate with a humorous, [[word play]] character name such as Adam Bomb or Blasted Billy. Two versions of each card were produced, with variations featuring the same artwork but a different character name denoted by an "a" or "b" letter after the card number. The sticker fronts are die-cut so just the kid with its nameplate and the GPK logo can be peeled from the backing. Many of the card backs feature puzzle pieces that form giant murals while other flip-side subjects vary greatly among the series, from humorous licenses and awards to comic strips and, in more recent releases, "[[Facebook]]" profiles.

Fifteen original series ("OS") of regular trading cards were released in the United States, with various sets released in other countries. Two large-format card editions were also released, as well as a set of fold-out posters. [[Garbage Pail Kids#All-New Series sets|All-New Series]] (ANS) sets were introduced in 2003, [[Garbage Pail Kids#Flashback re-releases|Flashback]] re-releases began in 2010, and a [[Garbage Pail Kids#Brand-New Series sets|Brand-New Series]] (BNS) was announced for 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpkonline.com/about.php About Garbage Pail Kids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628054317/http://www.gpkonline.com/about.php |date=2010-06-28 }} ''Garbage Pail Kids Online''&lt;/ref&gt; with Brand New series 2, Chrome OS1, and BNS3 following in 2013. A new format was released in 2014 using the year to designate the edition, followed by the release name of Series 1, which had an Olympics-style format. In 2016, the format was changed again to themed sets that spoofed different pop-culture topics.

==History==
The series was the brainchild of Topps consultant and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning cartoonist [[Art Spiegelman]] who came up with the product idea after the success of his earlier creations, Garbage Candy and [[Wacky Packages]]. The concept originally began as an unreleased Wacky Packages title,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poundart.com/gpk/unpub/unpub_gpks.html Wacky Packages Garbage Pail Kid] ''Pound Art''&lt;/ref&gt; but the management at Topps thought it would be a good idea for a separate spin-off series. Spiegelman and fellow cartoonist [[Mark Newgarden]] worked together as the editors and art directors of the project, [[Len Brown (comics)|Len Brown]] was the manager, and the first run of the cards was drawn exclusively by artist John Pound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poundart.com/gpk/index.html Garbage Pail Kids Index] ''Pound Art''&lt;/ref&gt; They were first issued in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Louis. [http://www.poundart.com/gpk/index.html "Garbage Pail Kids"]. Poundart. Retrieved May 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aintitcool.com/node/52875 "WTF Hollywood: The Garbage Pail Kids Movie"]. January 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the initial success of the cards, several additional artists and writers were brought in to contribute to the series, including [[Jay Lynch]], [[Tom Bunk]], and [[James Warhola]], among others.

==International versions==
The cards were also known as "Bukimi Kun" ["{{lang|ja|ぶきみくん}}", Mr. Creepy] in [[Japan]], "The Garbage Gang" in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] versions, "{{lang|es|La Pandilla Basura}}" [The Garbage Gang] in [[Spain]], "Havurat Ha-Zevel" ["{{lang|he|חבורת הזבל}}", "The Garbage Gang"] in [[Israel]], "{{lang|es|Basuritas}}" [Trashlings] in [[Latin America]], "{{lang|pt|Gang do Lixo}}/{{lang|pt|Loucomania}}" [Trash Gang/Crazymania] in [[Brazil]], "{{lang|it|Sgorbions}}" [Snotlings] in [[Italy]], "{{lang|fr|Les Crados}}" [The Filthies] in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], and "{{lang|de|Die total kaputten Kids}}" [The Totally Broken Kids] in [[Germany]]. 

===Variations===
A smaller-sized card format was released in Australia and New Zealand. Each pack contained three stickers and the "peel here" arrow pointed to the top left area since there was no die-cut scoring. Initially in New Zealand a 6th series of the Garbage Pail Kids was released as a market test (this version was a mix of the United States series 6 and 7). After this success, Series 1 was released in Australia and New Zealand known as "The Garbage Gang" and was identical to the United States version (albeit smaller in size). The first series was released in Australia and New Zealand in 1989 with different versions: the Australian stickers were darker, had a different banner, and some of the names were changed to reflect cultural differences. From Series 2 onward, the same version was released in Australia and New Zealand. Series 4 was the last release of "The Garbage Gang".

==Commercial success==
The commercial success of the trading cards led to the production of a live-action movie, ''[[The Garbage Pail Kids Movie]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093072/ Garbage Pail Kids Movie] ''Internet Movie Database''&lt;/ref&gt; in 1987. An [[Garbage Pail Kids (animated series)|animated television series]] was also created, but its initial scheduled broadcast in the US was postponed due to parental complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childofthe1980s.com/2011/01/31/garbage-pail-kids/ Garbage Pail Kids TV Series Parental Complaints] ''Child of the 1980s''&lt;/ref&gt; The show did make a brief appearance on US television years after it was originally intended to air and was also briefly aired in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wharble.com/Garbage_Pail_Kids.htm Garbage Paiids TV Series Airs in Europe] ''Wharble''&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was released on DVD by [[MGM Home Entertainment]] on July 12, 2005 (the original VHS had been distributed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), and the cartoon series was later also released on DVD by [[CBS Home Entertainment]] on April 4, 2006 (with distribution by Paramount). A similar set of 160 trading cards called the Sloppy Slobs was released in Italy in 1993.

==Controversy and lawsuit==

===School ban===
During the height of the card series' popularity, Garbage Pail Kids were banned in many schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Garbage Pail Kids Rage Stirring Up Controversy|work= Sun Sentinel|date=February 19, 1986|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-02-19/features/8601110201_1_garbage-pail-kids-cabbage-patch-kids-2-inch-cards|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main reasons for the ban was that teachers cited them as distractions during class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skooldays.com/categories/toys/ty1172.htm Garbage Pail Kids Distracting to Schoolchildren] ''Skool Days''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trademark infringement lawsuit===
Topps was sued by the makers of Cabbage Patch Kids, [[Coleco]], for [[trademark]] infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Copyrights: Trouble in the Garbage Pail|work=Time|date=March 17, 1986|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960905,00.html|accessdate=2010-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Around the Nation; Judge Rules in Case Of Garbage Pail Kids|work= The New York Times|date=August 30, 1986|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/30/us/around-the-nation-judge-rules-in-case-of-garbage-pail-kids.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Cabbage%20Pail%20Kids&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the out-of-court settlement, Topps agreed to modify the appearance of the Garbage Pail Kids to remove the resemblance between the characters, and to change the logo design. Production of the cards themselves continued, but by 1988 sales had dwindled and a planned 16th series was never produced.

==All-New Series sets==
In 2003, Topps reintroduced Garbage Pail Kids with all-new artwork, dubbed the All-New Series ("ANS"). ANS1 was largely made up of artwork intended for release in the 1980s, but 2004's ANS2 featured brand new concepts. Unique numbers on the backs of silver- and gold-foil insert cards could be redeemed online at the official Garbage Pail Kids website where visitors build and "gross out" their own Garbage Pail Kids; as the number of unique code numbers applied to the character increases, the more gross it becomes. Less than six months later, ANS3 was released.

In 2005, Topps celebrated the 20th anniversary of the GPK franchise with special "Sketch Card" original art inserts for its ANS4 set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradercracks.com/news/non-sports/2005/april/overview_gpk4.html Garbage Pail Kids ANS4 Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819101235/http://www.tradercracks.com/news/non-sports/2005/april/overview_gpk4.html |date=2010-08-19 }} ''Trader Crack's''&lt;/ref&gt; These were limited to one randomly inserted card per hobby-exclusive box (available only from specialty retailers) and featured original artwork by series regulars [http://www.poundart.com/gpk/index.html John Pound], [[Tom Bunk]], and [[Jay Lynch]], as well as guest artists Strephon Taylor, John Czop, [[Don Perlin]], and [[Justin Green (cartoonist)|Justin Green]]. Although a regular to the series with over 35 paintings, Luis Diaz was not involved in the sketch cards due to a previous financial dispute with Topps from years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ANS5 was released with 40 more new kids (each with an a/b twin), followed by ANS6 in early 2007. January 2008 saw the release of ANS7 which expanded the base set to 55 new characters and was the last set to feature new artwork until 2010's Flashback Series 1 subset of six previously unpublished kids.

The ANS cards differ from the original series ("OS") in a number of ways, the most obvious being the upgraded quality of card stock with a glossy protective surface. The ANS releases also changed the card numbering format: OS cards used a continuous numbering pattern so that each new set would pick up where the last one ended (e.g. OS1 ended at 41a/b and OS2 picked up at 42a/b while ANS reset the numbering back to 1a/b with each subsequent release). Each ANS also featured special "chase cards" randomly inserted in packs; for example, foil cards show characters from the original series (with modified artwork due to the lawsuit), "[[Scratch and sniff|Scratch 'n Stink]]" cards, [[collectible card game]] cards, [[Temporary tattoos]], 3D pop-up cards, alphabet cards, activity cards, magnets, [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] "Loco Motion" cards, and die-cut jigsaw puzzle cards, along with special bonus cards available only at participating retailers in either "bonus boxes" or rack-packs; these bonus stickers were the first cards not to have a twin set.

==Flashback re-releases==
[[File:GPKBook.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A book with the first five series]]
Topps released a 25th anniversary "Flashback"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topps.com/entertainment/garbage-pail-kids/garbage-pail-kids-flashback |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709042050/http://www.topps.com/entertainment/garbage-pail-kids/garbage-pail-kids-flashback |archivedate=July 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; set on February 24, 2010, featuring reprints of characters from the original 1985–87 GPK series (eight each from OS1 to OS8) plus six previously unpublished "lost" characters and 10 "Where are They Now" cards showing classic GPKs drawn as they would appear today. Packs contained randomly inserted chase cards including lenticular Loco Motion, authentic printing plates, four levels of parallels, and hand-drawn artist sketches by pop-culture artists including [[Layron DeJarnette]], Brent Engstrom, Dave Gross, Mark Pingitore, [[Joe Simko]], Colin Walton, Fred Wheaton, Jeff Zapata, and veteran GPK artists [[Tom Bunk]] and [[Jay Lynch]].

A second Flashback set was released on February 23, 2011, with 65 more OS reprints from series 1 to 9 plus five more "lost" kids, 10 new "Where are They Now" cards, five 3D cards (resembling holograms but in full colour), unique artist sketches, and 10 "Adam Mania" cards showing variants of Adam Bomb's iconic mushroom cloud, plus parallels of the base and Adam Mania sets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B59OtHKW8tVadzMzLVl1WFcwRnM Garbage Pail Kids Flashback Series 2 Master Checklist] ''The Collectibles Workshop''&lt;/ref&gt;

GPK Flashback Series 3 followed on November 2, 2011, with 65 OS reprints, four "lost" kids, 10 "WatN?" cards, five 3D cards, 10 Adam Mania cards, artist sketches, and parallels.

Topps recently released a book that showcases the first five series.  The cover depicts a pack from the very first series released back in 1985.  Each card is displayed with the "a" name and the "b" name on the bottom corner of the page.

==Brand-New Series sets==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
In 2012, Topps announced it would reboot the Garbage Pail Kids franchise with new character and content themes more reminiscent of the original 1980s series in a set called "Brand-New Series 1" (BNS1). The set was released on October 24, 2012. BNS1 features 55 new GPK characters, a reality TV subset, motion cards, mix 'n' match stickers, parallels, artist sketch cards, and code cards redeemable for a chance to be painted as a GPK in the next BNS. BNS2 was released in March and features 55 new characters plus 18 reimagined characters plus lenticular cards, glow in the dark cards and folded cards. Unlike the all new series set and like the old series sets the numbering of BNS continues where the previous series ended. They have now announced that there will be a BNS3 released in the middle of October, after the release of the chrome edition in August.

==Chrome Series sets==
In October 2013, Topps re-released original series 1 as a metallic chromium set containing all 41 kids plus 14 previously unpublished characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beckett.com/news/2013/04/topps-is-bringing-chrome-to-garbage-pail-kids |title=Topps is bringing chrome to Garbage Pail Kids&amp;nbsp;— Beckett News |publisher=Beckett.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2014, Topps re-released 1985's original series 2 set plus 13 returning characters from series 2 characters that have been reimagined in previous garbage pail kid sets as chromium cards. Chrome cards are thicker than the original cards and are not stickers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beckett.com/news/2014/02/garbage-pail-kids-chrome-original-series-2-out-this-summer/ |title=Garbage Pail Kids Chrome Original Series 2 out this summer - Beckett News |publisher=Beckett.com |date=2014-02-20 |accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014 Series 1==
Topps released a series of all new cards with brand new artwork for 2014. Like the older cards, these have activities on the back of the cards including checklists, puzzles, and "[[Facebook|Fakebook]]" profiles.

==30th Anniversary series==
In July 2015, Topps released the 30th Anniversary series with 110 a/b cards (220 cards total). The numbering differed from previous series in that instead of ranging from 1–110a/b it had several themed subsets each of which started at 1 a/b with the subsets being checklist cards featuring variations of Adam Bomb 1–2a/b including Adam Bomb "Don't Push My Button" featuring classic GPK characters pressing Adam Bomb's button 1–10a/b, "Artistic Impression" featuring historical art as GPK characters 1–10a/b, "Artistic Interpretation" featuring characters drawn by guest artists 1–5a/b, "Comic Book Covers" featuring art from the comic books 1–7a/b, "Cutting Room Floor" featuring rejected concepts 1–5a/b, "Garbage Pail Kids' Kids" featuring the children of classic GPK characters 1–10a/b, "Garbage Pail Pets" featuring animals as garbage pail kids 1–10a/b, "Garbage Pail Presidents" featuring 10 former U.S. presidents as Garbage Pail Kids 1–10a/b, "Lost Original Art" featuring the original paintings of classic GPKs which were never before published 1–6a/b, "Zoom Out" featuring zoomed-out GPKs showing what happened in the background 1–10a/b, and "'80s Spoofs" featuring spoofs of things that were popular in the 1980s 1–25a/b.

==Yearly themed series==
After the 30th Anniversary series, Topps began using a new formula that structured each series with an overall theme divided into subsets focusing on particular topics. In January 2016, "American as Apple Pie in Your Face" put GPKs in situations that parodied American culture. A second 2016 series followed in April called "Prime Slime Trashy TV" with humorous takes on popular television shows. The first series for 2017 was January's "Adam-geddon" which put the Garbage Pail Kids (including some classic kids) in perilous end-times scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B59OtHKW8tVaaU1SbVFoV0xjRkE Garbage Pail Kids Adam-geddon Master Checklist] ''The Collectibles Workshop''&lt;/ref&gt; Topps announced that the second series for 2017 will arrive in October and be the "Battle of the Bands" caricaturing popular music acts and album covers.

{{Main|The Garbage Pail Kids Movie}}
On August 21, 1987, a live-action film based on the card characters was released.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lXmuXVGidY Garbage Pail Kids Movie Trailer] ''YouTube''&lt;/ref&gt; Its campy production made it both a critical and commercial flop, opening poorly in 374 theaters with initial receipts of $661,512 and total gross receipts of $1,576,615, barely making back its 1 million dollar budget. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 0% critic rating and 35% audience rating. The film is considered [[List of films considered the worst|one of the worst films ever made]]. Topps featured advertisements for the movie on the original series 9 and 10 box-topper poster and variant wrapper.

===Planned future film===
On March 12, 2012, it was announced that [[Michael Eisner]]'s [[Tornante Company]] would be producing a new movie based on the Garbage Pail Kids, likely with computer-generated character imagery. Michael Vukadinovich was hired to write the screenplay for the film and [[PES (director)|PES]] has been hired to direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= The Garbage Pail Kids Return to the Big Screen|work= ComingSoon.net|date=March 12, 2012|url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=87958|accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/03/michael-eisners-tornante-company-behind-feature-adaptation-of-garbage-pail-kids/ |title=Michael Eisner’s Tornante Company Behind Feature Adaptation Of ‘Garbage Pail Kids’ |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film is currently no longer in development.

The '''Hollywood Indian''' is a fictitious [[stock character]], a stereotype and misrepresentation of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] used in movies, especially in the [[Western film|Western]] genre. The image of the Hollywood Indian reflects neither contemporary nor historical Native American realities; instead, it is based in the views and desires of non-Native producers, screenwriters, directors, and actors. Closely connected to myths and images created about Native Americans and the [[Wild West]], the stereotype has undergone significant changes from the beginning of cinema to the present day.

==Stereotypical images of Native Americans==

===History===
The Hollywood Indian has his roots in the Western as a [[literary genre]]. Ideas such as the vanishing Indian, or the [[noble savage|noble]] and [[ignoble savage]], were made popular by authors such as [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. This popular wild west literature revolved around frontiersmen, [[American pioneer|pioneers]], and settlers struggling against nature, lawlessness, and Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Price, "The Stereotyping of North American Indians in Motion Pictures." In G.M. Bataille and C.L.S. Silet, eds. ''The Pretend Indians: Images of Native Americans in the Movies'' (Ann Arbor: Books on Demand, 1994), 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing upon genres such as the [[captivity narrative]], these novels rely on a variety of stereotypes. Although supposedly sympathetic to Native Americans, Cooper simplified and polarized Native characters and experiences. While portraying some of his Native main characters as regal, he also portrayed them as the last of their kind and thus enforced the image of the 'vanishing Indian'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacquelyin Kilpatrick , ''Celluloid Indians. Native Americans and Film'' (Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1999), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the most persistent images carried into the 20th century. Literary models promoted the idea of Native Americans being either noble or ignoble, and the negative image legitimized concepts such as [[manifest destiny]] and the resulting need to eliminate the "Indian threat" to American [[civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;Ken Nolley, "John Ford and the Hollywood Indian." ''Film and History'' 23.1–4 (1993): 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wild West Shows]] spread these stereotypes to even larger audiences. Some individual Natives were made famous by non-Natives, who then promoted the racist idea that one man could stand for all Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Ward Churchill, Norbert Hill, and Mary Ann Hill, "Media Stereotyping and Native Response: An Historical Overview." ''The Indian Historian'' 11.4 (1978): 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The mainstream image of Natives underwent a major change in the 19th century. While in the centuries before, European depictions of Native Americans had been characterized by a certain nakedness, from mid-century on the naked or partly naked "demi-god or cannibal" was replaced by the mounted, be-feathered, and 'decently' dressed warrior. Most characteristics of this latter stereotypical Native American were taken from various tribal groups of the [[Great Plains]] as they appeared in the 19th century – such as the [[war bonnet]], the [[teepee]], the pipe, and the riding skills. Apparently, already [[Buffalo Bill]] picked the [[Sioux]] as his favourite "tribe" due to their riding skills and outer appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Hill, Hill, "Media Stereotyping", 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Lutz, ''Approaches. Essays in Native North American Studies and Literatures'' (Augsburg: Wißner, 2002), 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of Indian stereotyping===
In the context of the Western movies, images ranged from 'the savage warrior' who took the shape of the [[noble savage]] – the heroic and noble hunter/warrior who is most often [[stoicism|stoic]], in touch with nature, and peace-loving but willing to fight when necessary. Furthermore, derogatory images of the drunken Indian, and the [[shaman]] character, who was depicted as mysterious and deeply religious, exist.&lt;ref&gt;John Mihelich, "Smoke or Signals? American Popular Culture and the Challenge to Hegemonic Images of American Indians in Native American Film." ''Wicazo Sa Review'' 16.2 (2001), 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacquelyn Kilpatrick names three classes of these offensive stereotypes: mental, sexual, and spiritual. She attributes most meaning to the first class, which characterizes Native Americans as being inferior to Euro-Americans in terms of intellect, leading to a "dumb, dirty, and stupid" image of Native Americans. The second class portrays especially male Native Americans as intensely sexual beings who are more "creature than human", run around half-naked, and do little more than lusting after white maidens. The last category views the Native American as a spiritual being. Although this [[spirituality]] is perceived as an inherent closeness to nature and especially the earth, which gives Native peoples a "certain nature-based nobility", it is also regarded as simple and heathen.&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, ''Celluloid Indians'', xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Hollywood Indian===
Hollywood Indians are usually based solely on stereotypes of the [[Plains Indians]], such as the [[Lakota People|Lakota]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Comanche]], ignoring completely the cultural diversity of the many tribes in North America. Although the [[film industry]] "is (mostly) far from purposeful distortion", technical and business-related production decisions affect the Native American screen image.&lt;ref&gt;John E. O'Connor, "The White Man's Indian. An Institutional Approach." In P.C. Rollins and John E. O'Connor, eds. ''Hollywood's Indian: The Portrayal of the Native American in Film'' (Lexington/KY: University Press of Kentucky, 2003), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Connor argues that audiences have certain expectations for characteristic representation – such as easy comprehensibility of the [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] and the [[morality]] – which they value over authenticity, and the same holds true for stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, "The White Man's Indian", 32ff.&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the above features also apply to literature or other media, specific business-related decisions influence film in a way that might advance the stereotypical depiction of Native Americans. The impact of the resulting distorted images in film can be considered in different terms than that of other media. While novels certainly reach a broad public, the world-wide distribution of films allows for an amount of spectators on a totally different scale – not only in numbers, but also emotionally by using filmic devices such as light, music, and [[camera angles]].&lt;ref&gt;Vine Deloria, Jr., "Foreword/American Fantasy." In G.M. Bataille and C.L.S. Silet, eds. ''The Pretend Indians: Images of Native Americans in the Movies.'' (Ann Arbor: Books on Demand, 1994), ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the dominant carrier of filmic misrepresentations of Native Americans, the Western genre emerged in the early days of cinema and remained popular through much of the 20th century. Crucial to the [[frontier myth]], the settlement of the West, and the founding of white civilization are the [[antagonist]]s, and the [[indigenous population]], served as the opposition to the white Western hero personifying the "agent of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Berkhofer, ''The White Man's Indian. Images of the American Indian from Columbus to the Present'' (New York: Random House, 1978), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; These antagonists in form of a fictional, homogenized celluloid Indian have never really existed except in the stories told by white Americans to white audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, ''Celluloid Indians'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] explains how cinema and cultural identity go hand in hand. Identity is not a static fact, but rather something that can be continually reproduced. The ways that identities are portrayed in film are typically not the same as they are in reality. The interpretation of an identity in film is determined both by the filmmakers and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Stuart|title=Cultural identity and cinematic representation|journal=Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media|date=1989|volume=36|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the majority of films in the United States featuring Native Americans were made by Euro-American filmmakers up until the 1970s, Native Americans were not represented from an authentic perspective and were often cast in [[stereotypes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aleiss|first1=Angela|title=From Adversaries to Allies: The American Indian in Hollywood Films, 1930-1950|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth-century images===
Early depictions of Native Americans in film are surprisingly diverse. Although the Indian as the villain, antagonist, or simple-minded savage was present, a complex array of characters populated the silent screens between 1909 and 1913, a period when Indian characters where especially popular: the villain could be white as well as Indian; lasting white–Indian relationships emerged; and mixed-blood Indians could be villainous as well as sympathetic.  [[Edwin Carewe]] (real name Jay Fox), a Chickasaw filmmaker from that era, made more than 60 feature films and directed the 1928 version of ''[[Ramona]]'' starring Delores Del Rio and Waner Baxter.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Aleiss, ''Making the White Man's Indian. Native Americans and Hollywood Movies'' (Westport/CT and London: Praeger, 2005), pp.  2, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late teens, the popularity of Indian movies and [[cowboy]]-and-Indian movies decreased, and even though Indian movies continued to be produced in moderate numbers, they only became popular again by the mid 1930s. One of the most notable directors from 1924's ''[[The Iron Horse]]'' to 1964's ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' was [[John Ford]], often working with [[John Wayne]] as his male protagonist. Ford's depiction of Native Americans actually showed both hostile and sympathetic Indians such as in ''[[Stagecoach]]'' (1939), but also in ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948) and ''[[Wagon Master]]'' (1950).&lt;ref&gt;Angela Aleiss, "A Race Divided: The Indian Westerns of John Ford," ''American Indian Culture &amp; Research Journal'', 18 (2), Summer 1995, 25–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two movies in the [[cavalry trilogy]], ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' and ''[[She Wore A Yellow Ribbon]]'' (1949) feature sympathetic Indians with speaking roles and the conflict is mostly the fault of white prejudice rather than the inherently bad nature of the typical screen Indians. Not all Indian portrayals were savage; by 1950, Delmer Daves' ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' had set the stage for a new era of Indian/white peaceful coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Aleiss, "Hollywood Addresses Postwar Assimilation: Indian/White Attitudes in ''Broken Arrow'', ''American Indian Culture &amp; Research Journal'', 11 (1), 1987, 67–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

A gradual change in the American Indian's screen image did occur from the 1940s and 1950s onwards, at the height of the Western's popularity, when a turn towards "the gradual elimination of the stereotypes in big budget movies " is noticeable. The social and political consequences of the [[World War II]] paved the way, as Native Americans were no longer the principal antagonists and World War II supplied America with new enemies, namely, the Germans, Italians, and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Price, "The Stereotyping of North American Indians", 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1960s and early 1970s saw a decline in the production of Western films, thus also diminishing the representation of Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Price, "The Stereotyping of North American Indians", 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced heavily by the experiences of the Vietnam war, Native Americans symbolically came to signify any indigenous population threatened by annihilation at the hands of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, ''Approaches'', 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, though the typical savage disappeared almost entirely from the big screen, Native Americans in motion pictures were reduced to a vehicle of criticism of contemporary politics.

The 1970s and especially the late 1980s saw the emergence of [[independent film]]s outside the Western genre depicted contemporary Native life. The decisive difference was that "Native American characters become significant in and of themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hilger, ''From Savage to Nobleman. Images of Native Americans in Film'' (Lanham/MD and London: Scarecrow Press, 1995), 205.&lt;/ref&gt; At a time when the Western was nearly extinct, this new image marked an important step towards a greater variety of Native American images on screen. By the mere fact that it involved Native Americans in the production process more than ever before – by employing Native actors for Native parts, for telling stories from a Native perspective, sometimes basing them on Native novels – these films contributed to the visibility of Native peoples. Some examples are ''[[House Made of Dawn]]'' (1972),  ''[[Spirit of the Wind]]'' (1979), and [[Powwow Highway]] (1989), although none of these films attracted a large, mainstream audience. More accurate film representations were now being made, but they were reaching nowhere near the exposure of the earlier, stereotypical  images in Westerns.&lt;ref&gt;James Sandos and Larry Burgess, "The Hollywood Indian versus Native Americans. ''Tell Them Willie Boy is Here'' (1969)." In P.C. Rollins and John E. O'Connor, eds. ''Hollywood's Indian: The Portrayal of the Native American in Film.'' Lexington/KY: University Press of Kentucky, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) unexpectedly revived the Western genre. Arguably the most influential Native American-themed film of the last few decades, it paid reasonably careful attention to the depiction of Lakota life, traditions and clothing, at least compared to earlier efforts. However, the basic formula of the Hollywood stereotypes – at its heart the idea of the white lead '[[going Native]]', the arrival of the 'White Saviour' – was not transcended, and there were still cultural errors in the film. Thus, the evaluation of scholarly criticism boiled down to granting the film good intentions, but at the same time classifying the movie as a [[revisionist Western]] simply replaying the romantic Noble Savage with the white as the hero.&lt;ref&gt;Hilger, ''From Savage to Nobleman'', 223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seth Bovey, "Dances with Stereotypes: Western Films and the Myth of the Noble Red." ''South Dakota Review'' 31.1 (1993), 119ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, "The Radical Conscience in Native American Studies." ''Wicazo Sa Review'' 7.2 (1993), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dances with Wolves'' was followed by other sympathetic or revisionist Western [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] such as ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1992), and ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]'' (1993) and caused [[mainstream]] media to put American Indians on their agenda, at least for a short while. One of the few Hollywood movies that portrays Native life outside the Old West and instead sets its story in contemporary times is ''[[Thunderheart]]''.

===Contemporary Native American cinema===
In the past two decades, a striving Native American independent cinema has developed. Native Americans have formed their own production companies and political organizations to influence their own representations and to counter negative stereotypes. What distinguishes Native American cinema from Hollywood productions is the involvement of American Indians as directors, writers, and producers, such as [[Sherman Alexie]], [[Chris Eyre]], [[Sterlin Harjo]], [[Hanay Geiogamah]], and [[Greg Sarris]]. Two of the most characteristic features are the casting of Native actors for Native roles, and the setting of the stories in contemporary America as opposed to the 19th-century West. ''[[Lakota Woman]]'' (TV 1994), ''[[Skinwalkers]]'' (TV 2002), ''[[Smoke Signals (film)|Smoke Signals]]'' (1998), ''[[The Business of Fancydancing]]'' (2002), [[Grand Avenue (TV series)|Grand Avenue]] (TV 1996), and ''[[Edge of America]]'' (TV 2003) are some best-known examples.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Brockman, "Telling the Truth from Inside Indian Country." ''The New York Times'' (September 29, 2002). Note that Native American filmmakers made several movies after the article's publication.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, new media is providing a platform for short films and videos by independent producers, comedians, and other content-creators.

Filmmakers such as [[Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie|Hulleah J. Tsinhnahjinnie]], [[Shelley Niro]], and [[Sherman Alexie]] have incorporated the stereotypical images of Native Americans into their films and worked to reshape the meaning that has often been historically ascribed to them in cinema. These images include wildlife, beadwork, feathers, smoke, and nature. The stereotypes associated with these images are largely derived from a colonized, Euro-American perspective and are still fueled today by tourism and commercialism.

While the stereotypical representations have not accurately portrayed Native American culture, the fact that the images exist and are historically preserved allow filmmakers to reference well-known aspects of their cultural heritage and then reshape the meaning associated with the images. The stereotypical images represent a piece of Native American heritage that was not assimilated or eliminated.&lt;ref name="Ginsburg2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginsburg|first1=Faye|title=Media Worlds: Anthropology on New Terrain|date=2012|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles, CA|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; From here, contemporary Native American artists have begun to claim visual sovereignty over the images circulated in media. Visual sovereignty provides Native Americans the authority to authentically portray that which belongs to them—the images of their cultural heritage. This is a step towards retelling the legacy of colonization from a Native American perspective instead of the Euro-American perspective, and is also an opportunity to break the mold of stereotypes still around today that are largely driven by consumerism.&lt;ref name="Cummings2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauerkemper|first1=Joseph|title=Videographic Sovereignty: Hulleah J. Tsinhnahjinnie's Aboriginal World View|journal=Visualities: Perspectives on Contemporary American Indian Film and Art|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of contemporary films include themes about identity. Often, at least one of the characters grapples with honoring and acknowledging their cultural heritage while also living in a colonized society. The films also use various [[rhetorical device]]s to convey other cultural beliefs, including spirituality, life and death, time and space.

A short, but powerful representation of contemporary Native American film is ''Aboriginal World View'' (2003) by [[Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie|Hulleah J. Tsinhnahjinnie]]. The film was produced while the political climate was tense between the [[Middle East]] and the United States. The film shows a woman wrapped in a [[burqa]] made of American flags, looking out at the [[Navajo]] reservation. Powwow music plays in the background, which eventually transitions into the sound of the waves of the Pacific Ocean. Tsinhnahjinnie took the opportunity to create a piece from an indigenous person's perspective that spoke to the recurring history of war, land, diaspora, violence, oppression, and dispossession.&lt;ref name="Cummings2014" /&gt;

The film ''It Started With a Whisper'' (1993) by [[Shelley Niro]] is another example of contemporary Native American cinema reshaping the semiotic system behind [[Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America|Native American stereotypes]]. The film has an all-Native cast and was filmed in the Six Nations/Brantford area of Canada. The protagonist in the film, Shanna Sabbath, is an 18-year-old girl who grew up on the reservation, leaves to establish herself in an urban life, and returns to tend to family matters. The opening scene is a compilation of shots that show beadwork, hands throwing dirt in the air, and smoke rising into the air, all while the narrator speaks in the past tense—indicating something that has passed or been lost. The brief shots then give glimpses of a woman walking in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raheja|first1=Michelle|title=Visual Prophecies: Imprint and It Starts With a Whisper|journal=Visualities: Perspectives on Contemporary American Indian Film and Art|date=2014|pages=3–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypical images are heavily used, yet the film uses them to confront many misrepresentations of Native American people. From the opening scene, the film continues with rich, metaphorical images juxtaposed with urban lifestyle, interracial relationships, and allusions to other Native American cultural beliefs about time, space, and death.

Perhaps a more popular film amongst a mainstream audience is [[The Business of Fancydancing]] (2002) by [[Sherman Alexie]]. The film is about a young Native American man who grew up on a reservation and eventually lives his adult life as a gay poet in [[Spokane]]. The stark contrast between life on a reservation and life in a city open a more authentic glimpse into a modern experience of grappling with identity when one is part of both settings. Alexie chose to make a low-budget, independent film in order to maintain all financial and creative control over the film. The cast and crew are predominantly Native American. Alexie has stated that the primary audience is for the film is Native Americans. In an interview with Joelle Fraser in Iowa Review, he explained how the majority those who read his literature and poetry are white. He said, "There's something wrong with my not reaching Indians . . . Generally speaking Indians don't read books. It's not a book culture. That's why I'm trying to make movies. Indians go to movies; Indians own VCRs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Alst|first1=Theo|title=Sherman Shoots Alexie: Working with and without Reservation(s) in "The Business of Fancydancing"|journal=Visualities: Perspectives on Contemporary American Indian Film and Art|page=73-73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film breaks many stereotypes, and also uses dialogue incorporates [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] and subtle cultural nuances that are particularly familiar to a Native American audience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4740">[[File:HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Houmuwu ding at [[National Museum of China]]]]
The '''Houmuwu ding''' ({{zh|s=后母戊鼎|p=Hòumǔwù dǐng}}), formerly called '''Simuwu ding''' ({{zh|s=司母戊鼎|p=Sīmǔwù dǐng}}), is a rectangular bronze ''[[ding (vessel)|ding]]'' (sacrificial vessel, one of the common types of [[Chinese ritual bronze]]s) of the ancient Chinese [[Shang dynasty]]. It is the largest piece of bronzeware to survive from anywhere in the ancient world.&lt;ref name="nmc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_museum/2003-09/24/content_29769.htm|title=The National Museum of China|publisher=China Culture|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527232757/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_museum/2003-09/24/content_29769.htm|archivedate=2014-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unearthed in Wuguan Village, [[Anyang]], [[Henan]] in 1939.

==Owner==
The ''ding'' is named for the inscription in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronze ware script]] on the interior wall, which reads "Queen Mother Wu" ({{zh|c=后母戊|p=Hòumǔwù}}).&lt;ref name="Song. 2011"&gt;Li Song. ''Chinese Bronze Ware'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-521-18685-8}}), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the [[temple name]] of [[Fu Jing]], a queen of [[Wu Ding]].{{sfnp|Zeng|1993|p=71}} The ''ding'' was made after her death, presumably by her son, [[Zu Geng of Shang]].{{sfnp|Li|2012|p=13}} Whilst the ding itself was unearthed in 1939, [[Fu Jing]]'s tomb&lt;ref&gt;[[Yinxu]], tomb 260&lt;/ref&gt; was not located until 1959, and was found to have been [[Grave robbery|robbed out]].{{sfnp|Li|2012|p=13}}

==Description==
[[File:Chiang and HouMuWu Ding.jpg|thumb|[[Chiang Kai-shek]] (right) inspecting the Houmuwu ding in 1948]]
The ''ding'' is of the rectangular type, with four legs. It is 133 centimetres high, 110 centimetres wide, 79 centimetres deep, and weighs 832.84 kilograms.&lt;ref name="Song. 2011"/&gt; Compared to earlier ''ding'', such as the [[Duling rectangular ding]], it is wider and its walls are thicker, making it much more massive.&lt;ref name=LiSong&gt;Li Song. ''Chinese Bronze Ware'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Each side has a blank space in the middle, surrounded by a band of decoration featuring ''[[taotie]]'' (animal faced creatures) and ''[[Kui (Chinese mythology)|kuilong]]'' (one-legged dragons).&lt;ref name=LiSong /&gt; There are two handles, each decorated on the exterior with two [[tiger]]s facing each other, their jaws closing around a human head in between them, an image which is also found on [[Fu Hao]] battle axes.&lt;ref name=LiSong /&gt;

==Inscription debate==
The inscription was originally read as ''sīmǔwù'' (司母戊), but since the 1970s scholars have reached the consensus that the first character should be read as ''hou'' (后), meaning queen, which is the mirror-image of ''si'' (司) in [[oracle bone script]]. The [[National Museum of China]] has officially corrected its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.cntv.cn/20110328/102842.shtml |title="Houmuwu Quadripod" debuts at National Museum of China |newspaper=CCTV |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=20 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reading of the inscription meant that the owner of the ding was supposed to have been a wife of [[Wu Yi of Shang]] (reigned c. 1147–1112 BC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~g380/3.4-Kings-2010.pdf Shang Kingship and Shang Kinship]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the dedicator her son, [[Wen Ding]]&lt;ref name="Song. 2011"/&gt; (reigned c. 1112–1102 BC).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/chinadynasties/p/032509ShangDynst.htm ''Shang Dynasty'' by N.S. Gill], About.com Guide&lt;/ref&gt; However, understanding the first character as ''hou'' makes it the [[temple name]] of [[Fu Jing]], who lived earlier.{{sfnp|Zeng|1993|p=71}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="754">The '''Imperial Party of New Zealand''' is a [[political party]] from [[New Zealand]]. Its leader is Jeffery Robinson. Its policies include restricting [[immigration]], forced [[repatriation]], chemical [[castration]] for [[sex offender]]s, the re-introduction of [[slavery]], and supporting the creation of a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[Parliament]].

'''Incest between twins''' or '''twincest'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wagner|first1=Roy|title=An Anthropology of the Subject: Holographic Worldview in New Guinea and its meaning and significance for the world of anthropology|date=2001|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a subclass of [[sibling incest]] and includes both [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] relationships. While in modern Western European culture such behaviour is considered [[incest taboo|taboo]], incest between twins is a common feature in [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Asia]]n (such as Japan) and [[Oceania]]n [[mythology]], and there are a few societies in which the prohibition on it is limited or it is partially accepted.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== In Asian culture ==
In traditional [[Bali]]nese culture, it was{{when|date=December 2013}} common for a set of [[twin]]s of the opposite sex to marry each other, since it was assumed that they had had sex in utero. The standard anthropological explanation of this custom is based in explications of the conflicts between [[Cultural heritage|descent]] and affinity in Balinese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boon|first=James A.|title=Affinities and Extremes: Crisscrossing the Bittersweet Ethnology of East Indies History, Hindu-Balinese Culture and Indo-European Culture|year=1990|publisher=Chicago University Press|isbn=978-0-226-06463-5|pages=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEp1lzmyceYC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=incest%20twin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twin incest was a common feature of Balinese mythology. As in many other mythologies, the Balinese [[deities]] frequently marry their siblings without any of the incest-related issues faced by similarly-situated human couples.

This was commonplace in [[Southeast Asia]]n [[creation myth]]s which prominently featured twin or sibling couples. In these stories, the brother usually wooed and wed his sister, who bore his child(ren), but on discovering that they are siblings, they are often (but not always) forced to part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Errington, Atkinson |first=Shelley, Jane Monnig|title=Power and Difference: Gender in Island Southeast Asia|year=1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-1781-8|pages=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgWrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=%22incest%22%20%22twins%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] mythology, Malakás ("strong") and Magandá ("beautiful"), the first humans on earth, were fraternal twins born of the same bamboo stalk.

An old Japanese myth says that if two [[star-crossed lovers]] commit [[Suicide pact|dual suicide]], they are [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] as fraternal twins.

== In European culture ==
Twin incest is a prominent feature in ancient Germanic mythology, and its modern manifestations, such as the relationship between Siegmund and Sieglinde in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walküre]]'', and a feature in some [[Greek mythology]], such as the story of [[Byblis]] and [[Kaunos (mythology)|Kaunos]]. There are strong parallels between the Germanic portrayals of twin incest and those of the Balinese [[Ramayana]], and some scholars have speculated an early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boon|first=James A.|title=Affinities and Extremes: Crisscrossing the Bittersweet Ethnology of East Indies History, Hindu-Balinese Culture and Indo-European Culture|year=1990|publisher=Chicago University Press|isbn=978-0-226-06463-5|pages=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEp1lzmyceYC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=incest%20twin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme also appears in [[English literature]], such as the incest between the twins Polydore and Urania in [[Delarivier Manley]]'s ''The New Atlantis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollak|first=Ellen|title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684-1814|year=2003|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-7204-4|pages=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heN14DHX_IIC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=%22incest%22%20%22twins%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1983 review of the scholarly literature on twin homosexuality and twin incest, Ray Bixler concluded that "most same-sex homosexual twins, if reared with their co-twins, do not attempt or even want to seduce them in adulthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bixler |first=Ray H. |date=August 1983 |title=Homosexual Twin Incest Avoidance |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=296–302 |doi=10.1080/00224498309551190  |jstor=3812342}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study drew on [[Edvard Westermarck]]'s [[Westermarck effect|hypothesis]] that sexual desire is generally absent in relationships between members of a [[nuclear family]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edvard Westermarck|Westermarck, Edvard]] (1922). ''The History of Human Marriage'', Vol. II. New York: Allerton, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

One case of incest between twins, in which twins who were adopted by separate families as babies later married without knowing they were brother and sister, was mentioned in a [[House of Lords]] debate on the Human Fertility and Embryology Bill in January 2008. According to the charity Adults Affected by Adoption, there had been other cases of this sort that had involved siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parted-at-birth twins 'married' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7182817.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was widely publicised in the British press,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/shock-for-the-married-couple-who-discovered-they-are-twins-separated-at-birth-6682411.html|title=Shock for the married couple who discovered they are twins separated|last=|first=|date=2008-01-11|website=|publisher=The Evening Standard|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its truthfulness was called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Henley |title=Did a pair of twins really get married by mistake? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/15/familyandrelationships.jonhenley |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech identical twins Michal and Radek Cuma are male pornographic actors who in 2009 began having sex together in video performances as "Milo and Elijah Peters".

'''Iordan Chimet''' (November 18, 1924 – May 23, 2006) was a Romanian poet, children's writer and essayist, whose work was inspired by [[Surrealism]] and [[Onirism]]. He is also known as a memoirist, theater, art and film critic, book publisher and translator. Chimet, who was an opponent of [[totalitarianism]] in general and of the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] in particular, was persecuted by the latter as a [[dissident]], and lived much of his life in obscurity. His experience as an employee of the [[cooperative]] society [[Centrocoop]] also made him one of the first professional [[Copywriting|copywriters]] in his country.

The poems, [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] works and [[fairy tale]]s he authored, although largely ignored locally upon being published, have since drawn acclaim for their accomplished style, and are considered by many unique in [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]]. They explored the themes of [[innocence]] and [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], and have themselves been seen as a venue for a discreet advocacy of disobedience. Chimet was also the author of critical essays on [[Latin American studies]] and [[Western culture|Western]] or [[popular culture]], and a publisher of [[Anthology|anthologies]] on some of the major themes in Romanian society. In addition, he collected and published material on the life and legacy of playwright [[Mihail Sebastian]], as well as on the history of the Romanian [[avant-garde]].

Iordan Chimet had a lifelong friendship with [[Gheorghe Ursu]], a dissident who was killed by the [[Securitate]] secret police in 1985, and with [[science fiction]] author [[Camil Baciu]]. He was also a friend of the German writer [[Michael Ende]] and the Greek poet [[Odysseas Elytis]], with whom he kept in touch in spite of the difficulties posed by their living on different sides of the [[Iron Curtain]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Galaţi]], Chimet belonged to a family of middle-class intellectuals.  His first works of poetry were published by the magazine ''[[Vremea]]'' when he was still in high school.&lt;ref name="ghetquij"&gt;{{ro icon}} Monica Gheț, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna91.pdf "Evocare. «Ultimul Don Quijote»"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029025112/http://revistatribuna.ro/arhiva/tribuna91.pdf |date=2007-10-29 }}, in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Vol. V, Nr. 91, June 2006, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Politically active while still a teenager during [[World War II]], he was part of an [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] group in his native city.&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"&gt;{{ro icon}} Andrei Ursu, [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2006-06-16&amp;art=2811 "Despărţire de Iordan Chimet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016220100/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=2811&amp;nr=2006-06-16 |date=2007-10-16 }}, in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 849, June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The cell, which opposed [[Ion Antonescu]]'s rule and Romania's alliance to the [[Axis Powers]] (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), also included Ursu and Baciu.&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt; The [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]'s secret police, ''[[Siguranţa Statului]]'', had Chimet under surveillance from 1943 until the [[King Michael Coup]] of 1944.&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt; Chimet, unlike his friends, was not drawn into collaboration with the [[Romanian Communist Party]], being apprehensive of [[communism]] in general and of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence in particular.&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;

He was a graduate of the Philology and Philosophy Department (1948), and of the Law Department (1957) of the [[University of Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt; Following the start of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]], he was active in supporting writers proscribed by the new authorities and joined a clandestine society to offer them help—known as the ''Eminescu Association'', after Romania's famous 19th century poet [[Mihai Eminescu]], it sought assistance from the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]].&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cernatscris"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Scrisori-din-Tara-Minunilor*articleID_5450-articles_details.html "Scrisori din Ţara Minunilor"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 25, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asdetinut"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alex.

In the years leading up to the Communist regime's establishment, Iordan Chimet published poems with [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] undertones (''ExiL'', "ExiLe") in ''[[Revista Fundaţiilor Regale]]'' and ''Revista Româno-Americană''.&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Intoarcerea-pestisorului-Baltazar*articleID_2918-articles_details.html "Întoarcerea peştişorului Baltazar"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 59, April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csscutier"&gt;[[Constantin Stănescu (literary critic)|Constantin Stănescu]], "Un scutier al iluziei", in ''[[România Liberă]]'', May 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he met the art and literary critic [[Petru Comarnescu]], who helped him publicize his works.&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt; Reportedly, Comarnescu proposed his poems for an award, but this was never granted.&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"/&gt;

Refusing to adapt his style to [[Socialist realism in Romania|Socialist realism]], Chimet was himself considered a suspect, and lived in extreme poverty during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; Literary critic [[Paul Cernat]] indicated that Chimet was able to evade arrest only because Tonegaru, who had been arrested, did not give in to violent interrogation.&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; Ursu and Baciu were themselves disillusioned with communism after 1949-1950, and broke with the Communist Party around that time.&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;

Chimet was subject to an inquiry for "[[Enemy of the people|anti-people activities]]", and sentenced to work as a [[lathe]] operator for a worker [[cooperative]].  Soon after, he was moved to what was considered a lower position, that of copy-editor for [[Centrocoop]] commercials, an office whose equivalent in [[Capitalism|capitalist]] countries was that of [[Copywriting|copywriter]] (Chimet was thus one of Romania's first persons to have this job description after World War II).  It was in this field that he gained first-hand experience in [[marketing]], which was to prove an important theme in some of his essays.&lt;ref name="dumitrescu40"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Dumitrescu, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=129&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=3083 "40 de zile fără Iordan Chimet"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Vol. III, Nr. 129, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He was allowed to publish beginning in the late 1960s, with the [[liberalization]] coinciding with the early years of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s leadership.&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mfinkenthalint"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Michaël Finkenthal]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/INTERSECTII.-A-murit-Iordan-Chimet*articleID_15512-articles_details.html "A murit Iordan Chimet"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 323, June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Chimet also found employment as a lecturer at the "Friends of Film" club at the ''Cinemateca'' film archive, where he kept company with film critics such as [[Paul Barbăneagră]], [[Tudor Caranfil]], [[Eugen Schileru]] and [[D. I. Suchianu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[G. Brătescu]], ''Ce-a fost să fie. Notații autobiografice'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2003, p.307.  {{ISBN|973-50-0425-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works of criticism touched aspects of [[Western culture]] that he intended to popularize in Romania: two of them were dedicated, respectively, to the American-born [[Western (genre)|Western genre]] (''Western. Filmele Vestului îndepărtat''—"Western. The Films of the Far West") and to the [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]] in general (''Eroi, fantome, șoricei''—"Heroes, Ghosts, Little Mice");&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt; other works dealt with the visual arts in [[South America]], with [[Latin American art]] and [[Latin American studies]].&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt; This focus, together with the praise to [[innocence]] he provided in his [[fairy tale]]s and [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] works, as well as in his 1972 [[Editura Ion Creangă]] anthology (''Cele 12 luni ale visului. O antologie a inocenței'', "The 12 Months of Dreaming. An Anthology of Innocence"), have themselves been seen as signs of resistance through culture.&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mdsubvers"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marina Debattista, [http://www.romlit.ro/subversiunea_inocenei "Subversiunea inocenţei"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 22/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

While his work was ignored at home, it brought Chimet a measure of success abroad. His essays on American culture were generally not distributed in Romania, but were translated in other [[Eastern bloc]] countries, where they became appreciated for their subversive undertones.  In parallel, his works of [[children's literature]] were translated into several languages, and became known in America, as well as in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], on both sides of the [[Iron Curtain]]. He was selected to be part of the jury for the [[University of Oklahoma]]'s [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] (the only Romanian to enjoy this appointment), but the communist authorities' hostility prevented him from honoring the request.&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt;

Iordan Chimet did not cease his contacts with Western writers, and generally appealed to clandestine mail in order to have his messages sent across.&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; In 1977, he began corresponding with [[Michael Ende]], who was living in [[West Germany]].  The two shared a rejection for normative control over literature: while Chimet centered his criticism on the cultural guidelines imposed by Ceaușescu (''see [[April Theses]]''), Ende depicted in negative terms the impact of [[Neorealism (art)|Neorealism]] and the [[Marxist aesthetics]] popularized by [[Bertold Brecht]].  The writers never met face to face.  Later in life, Chimet was to preface the first Romanian edition of ''[[The Neverending Story]]''.&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; He also befriended the celebrated poet [[Odysseas Elytis]], as well as prominent critics of the Communist regime (historian [[Katherine Verdery]] and exiled writer [[Norman Manea]]) and artists from South and [[Central America]]n countries.&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt; Chimet edited and published Elytis' work in Romania—the resulting volume of collected poetry was deemed by Elytis "the most beautiful book dedicated to my work to have ever been published anywhere in the world."&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;

According to one theory, Gheorghe Ursu's 1985 killing, which was the result of repeated beatings in custody, was the result of [[Securitate]] pressures to have him expose some of his writer friends—Chimet's name was cited, alongside those of poets [[Nina Cassian]] and [[Geo Bogza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Gabriela Blebea Nicolae, [http://www.erudit.org/revue/ethno/2003/v25/n1/007132ar.html "Les défis de l'identité: Étude sur la problématique de l'identité dans la période post-communiste en Roumanie"], in ''Ethnologies'', Vol. 25, Nr. 1/2003 (hosted by [http://www.erudit.org/ Érudit.org])&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Chimet braved ongoing Securitate surveillance and attended Ursu's funeral.&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], Iordan Chimet centered his efforts on educating the Romanian public in respect to [[Democracy|democratic]] values. In collaboration with the [[Cluj-Napoca]]-based publishing company [[Editura Dacia]], he issued a collection of volumes, published under the collective title ''Ieșirea din labirint'' ("Exiting The Labyrinth"). It was as part of this that, in 1992-1993, he printed a four-volume dictionary on Romanian identity, ''Dreptul la memorie'' ("The Right to a Memory"), and the 1996 anthology called ''Momentul adevărului'' ("The Moment of Truth").  The two texts earned Ursu the Gheorghe Ursu Foundation Award for 1997.&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt; A member of the [[Romanian Writers' Union]], he was the recipient of its special prize in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.uniuneascriitorilor.ro/premii.html ''Premiile USR pentru anul editorial 2003''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211163730/http://www.uniuneascriitorilor.ro/premii.html |date=2007-12-11 }} at the [[Romanian Writers' Union]] site; retrieved November 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he published a volume of essays, titled ''Cele două Europe, cele două Românii'' ("The Two Europes, The Two Romanias").&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;

For most of his life, Chimet attempted to remain a [[freelancer]], and, despite financial constraints, refused state employment for all but five years of his life.&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt; During his final years, despite usually refusing to comment on his incidental career in marketing, Chimet agreed to give lectures on [[selling technique]] for a [[private university]]—it was one of the first courses of its kind in Romania.&lt;ref name="dumitrescu40"/&gt;

He died in the small apartment he owned, located in the [[Titan, Bucharest|Titan]] area of Bucharest.&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt; His last work, a second volume of collected correspondence, was published posthumously.&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csscutier"/&gt;

==Literary contributions==

===Style and literary credo===
Inspired by [[Surrealism]],&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csscutier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mdsubvers"/&gt; Iordan Chimet was a representative of the [[World War II]] generation in [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], and his anti-[[totalitarianism]] was placed in connection with his upbringing in a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] city.&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt; [[Paul Cernat]] proposed that Chimet was in may ways similar to members of the [[Onirism|Oniric]] trend—who also mixed subversive messages with imagery inspired by Surrealism—and especially to its representatives [[Leonid Dimov]] and [[Emil Brumaru]].&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; Like his friend Gheorghe Ursu, Iordan Chimet cultivated the [[avant-garde]],&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; and was interested in the writings of his predecessors [[Urmuz]], [[Gherasim Luca]] and [[Tristan Tzara]], as well as in those of his Surrealist contemporary [[Gellu Naum]].&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt; In 1999, he edited one of the first compilations of the Romanian avant-garde, with its title borrowed from Urmuz: ''Cică niște cronicari, duceau lipsă de șalvari'' ("It Seems It Did Happen Once, Some Chroniclers Lacked Baggy Pants").&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Recuperarea-lui-Ionathan-X.-Uranus*articleID_14491-articles_details.html "Recuperarea lui Ionathan X. Uranus"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 299, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to replicate the experience of [[Interwar period|interwar]] authors, who, as he himself argued, practiced "art as an exercise in admiration, as a statement of love, as a manifestation of the artist's solidarity with beings forgotten by history."&lt;ref name="mfinkenthalint"/&gt;

In parallel, his active and determined involvement in cultural resistance has led several authors to liken him to [[Don Quixote]], the [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgo]] character crafted by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] (''see [[Quixotism]]'').&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csscutier"/&gt; Seen as withdrawn and original,&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; he doubled his political criticism with a vivid interest in topics related to [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]], including [[mythology]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[alchemy]] and [[demonology]]—part of his work as a literary critic involved tracing the influences these had on [[popular culture]] and [[naïve art]], as well as in [[science fiction]] and other areas of [[paraliterature]].&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; According to his friend, essayist Monica Gheț, Chimet's style was the equivalent of "a mirror held in front of the local art's [[subconscious]] in times of need", while his stance was "pure and combative".&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;

In a 1980 book of literary and art criticism, Romanian author and [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] hermit [[Nicolae Steinhardt]] voiced admiration for Chimet's interpretation of [[Romanian folklore]], both rural and urban, as noted in Chimet's 1976 [[travel writing]] volume ''Baladă pentru vechiul drum'' ("A Ballad to the Old Road"). Steinhardt sees Chimet's "entire effort" and lifelong message concentrated and explained by the book's title, together with that of Chimet's [[fairy tale]] novel ''Închide ochii și vei vedea Orașul'' (which translates as "Close Your Eyes and You Will See The Town"). In his interpretation: "''Vechiul drum'' is the road to reality, to nature, to the awareness of people and their age-old, eternal, culture, acute and responsible in the present as well. […] Close your eyes in front of the superficial, in front of retail merchandise, in front of the "in other news" columns and in front of all gadgets which may tempt you, delude you, entice you and fool you, in front of all dissimulation, hasty lies and noisy or shiny glass beads of the county fairs, and you will see the true reality, poetic and perennial, of your space and the people who inhabit it—the underlying structures, the columns, the crowns."&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinhardt argues that his fellow writer had helped the public make comparisons between the tenets of Surrealism and the natural tendencies in [[folk art]]: "The conclusion, I do believe, is unavoidable: surreality exists, only people call it reality. By vesting the most modest of realities with the prestige and the charm of fairy tales and poetry, Chimet invites (and compels) us to admit them as situated at an energetic and [[incantation]]al level by no means inferior to the most delicate fantasies and the least bound reveries of Surrealism."&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; He adds: "The world reveals itself [to Chimet] in its entirety, in its rich coloring, in the unending complexity of its textures, in the steady and calm rhythm of various activities and contemplations synchronized with the individual's [[Wiktionary:Psychosomatic|psychosomatic]] foundations. Nature […], the inanimate world […], even costumes or musical instruments […] evoke in him human activities, while the energies of matter are interpreted in a human sense and joined up with aspirations and sorrows found the human soul."&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt, p.74-75&lt;/ref&gt; The critic also proposed that such images in ''Vechiul drum'' were superior to a separate chapter on film history "from ''[[Fantômas (1913 serial)|Fantômas]]'' to [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]] and ''[[Hatari!|Hatari]]''": "No matter how much Iordan Chimet is enchanted by the screen, no matter how contagious his [[cinemaphile]] passion may be, it is not in this area that he is truly at ease and worthy of being called a discoverer and unveiler of poetry. He earns these qualifiers mostly when he takes hold […] of a traveler's cane, setting off to the country's villages, workshops, establishments and hidden corners in order to set before our eyes […] the treasures of a reality on whose shoulders ''time sets itself with old age'' [Steinhardt's italics], but who has lost neither courage, nor warm wisdom or a charm renewed with each fresh gaze."&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
As a political essayist, in addition to his critique of totalitarian systems both [[Left-wing politics|left]]- and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]], Chimet was noted for his rejection of all forms of [[racism]], and for being an outspoken critic of [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csscutier"/&gt; According to Andrei Ursu, Gheorghe Ursu's son, this led [[Nationalism|nationalist]] voices to accuse Chimet, an [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] who defended members of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]], of having become a ''jidovit'' ("Jew-turned").&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt; Literary critic [[Constantin Stănescu]] linked his political views to the spirit of his works of fiction, defining him as "a Surrealist recoverer of innocence and a Utopian militant for purity, with a stubborn and inflexible faith […] in the victory of tolerance and communion against racial or class intolerance, as well as against the outbursts of the aggressive primeval spirit during the long century into which he was given to be born."&lt;ref name="csscutier"/&gt; Writing in 2006, Gheț argued that his anthologies were drawing up "the map of spiritual freedom and its impartation along unsuspected [[Transatlantic relations|Euro-Atlantic]] lines, long before the political-strategic «axes» presently reclaimed."&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt; His activity in support of [[civil society]] has drawn comparisons with that of literary historian [[Adrian Marino]], a leading member of the [[Civic Alliance Foundation|Romanian Civic Alliance]],&lt;ref name="dumitrescu40"/&gt; while Marino himself referred to Chimet, [[Alexandru George]], [[Alexandru Paleologu]] and members of the [[Group for Social Dialogue]] as the sole "defenders of [[centrism|centrist]] cultural values" in [[History of Romania since 1989|post-1989 letters]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Marino]], ''Pentru Europa. Integrarea României: Aspecte ideologice și culturale'', [[Polirom]], Iași, 2005, p.183.  {{ISBN|973-681-819-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to essayist [[Michaël Finkenthal]], Chimet "spent the last years of his life in a ceaseless battle to retrieve a past that some have forgotten and others have preferred, for various reasons, to neglect." Finkenthal also defined Chimet's message as: "before incriminating, before accusing, research the facts carefully. When man is in chains, when speaking is replaced by yelling, [man] is weak and can be easily tempted by the devil."&lt;ref name="mfinkenthalint"/&gt;

Chimet himself argued: "All I could do was to defend, in the books I managed to publish, as well as in the everyday life that emerges and disappears, the ideas of friendship, loyalty and human solidarity which the world of my childhood was presenting to us as the foundations of existence." He was self-effacing when it came to his legacy: "the new taste of the times shall be viewing these [goals] from the stratosphere, [they] shall be viewed as a concise moral, perhaps worthy of children in a church choir, a [[Boy Scout]] mentality, a [[Red Cross]] program, a street concert for the [[Salvation Army]]. The comparisons are unflattering, any plea in favor of these simple values seems compromised from the get-go. I must accept this handicap."&lt;ref name="csscutier"/&gt;

===''ExiL''===
His ''ExiL'' poems, some of which were first published in the West during the 1940s, have drawn comparisons with the imagery of original [[modern art]]ists such as [[Joan Miró]] and [[Paul Klee]].&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt; The title is a wordplay on ''exil'' (the [[Romanian language|Romanian-language]] word for "exile") and ''el'' ("him"), and the lyrics are addressed to a Jewish friend who had been deported during the [[Ion Antonescu]] dictatorship (''see [[Holocaust in Romania]]'').&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"/&gt; Decades later, Chimet indicated: "It was for the first time that the issue of exile showed up in Romania's post-war environment. At the time, it was, shall we say, a premiere. But it was not many years after that the [[Red Army]] turned this theme into a banal poetic motif."&lt;ref name="mfinkenthalint"/&gt;

The poems build on a repertoire of diverse traditions, which combines, in Paul Cernat words, "myths, symbols and ancient spiritual traditions, evoking the miraculous bestiary of humanity's childhood", assuming a shape similar to "[[troubadour]] ballads, [[blues]] and [[Spiritual (music)|Negro spiritual]] songs, with choirs and invocations addressed to a minute universe" and "peopled by creatures and inanimate objects suffering from a silent, nameless pain."&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"/&gt; Among these writings was the 1947 ''Cântec spiritual negru'' ("Negro Spiritual Song"), which centered on the imaginary figure of a Saint Benjamin.&lt;ref name="csscutier"/&gt;

Also according to Cernat, aside from Surrealism, some of the ''ExiL'' poems recalled [[Imagism]], while others were close to [[Lucian Blaga]]'s [[Expressionism]] and the original style developed by [[Constant Tonegaru]], or borrowed themes from the [[Bible|Biblical]] ''[[Ecclesiastes]]'' and the traditional stories of the [[Eastern world]].  A series of "laments", the pieces develop themes which Iordan Chimet would reuse in later works, such as the images of his native [[Galaţi]] as "the Old City" and an exiled monarch who would become "Baltazar the Little Fish".&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"/&gt; In one of the ''ExiL'' [[free verse]] pieces, titled ''Lamento cu o pălărie galbenă'' ("Lament with a Yellow Hat"), Chimet wrote of himself and the landscape of the Old City:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ro|Dar vara întârzia. Şi corăbiile ei cu pânze roşii
nu le-am zărit aruncând ancorele de fum deasupra sălciilor.
Am să cobor acum, să răstorn în praf, în faţa porţilor
turta uscată şi dulce de miere pentru păsările călătoare,
pentru veveriţele cu sacul de alune pe spate
care, în faţa casei noastre, fac un ultim popas
în drum spre pădure.}}&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"/&gt;
|
But summer tarried. And its ships with red sails,
I did not see throwing their smoke-like anchors over the willows.
I shall come down now, to throw in the dust, in front of the gates,
the dried-up and sweet honey cake for the migratory birds,
for the squirrels with their sacks of nuts hanging over their backs
who, in front of our house, make one last rest stop
on their way to the forest.}}

===Fantasy writings===
His fantasy works partly built on the Surrealist-Oniric legacy.&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; Gheț proposed that such writings have been "mistakenly" placed in the field of [[children's literature]]—she preferred to define them as "transfers, evasions from the new mythical-totalitarian reality where all the Romanian sagacity had become stranded."&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt; In Paul Cernat's view, they form part of the fantasy genre to be read by adults, similar to the writings of [[Edward Lear]], [[Antoine de Saint Exupéry]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Peter Beagle]], and [[Lewis Carroll]].&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; Cernat argued: "Condescending prejudice has sought to exile [Chimet] into a shelf of curiosities merely frequented by a closed circle of connoisseurs: Chimet—the children's author, Chimet—the author of anthologies-manifestos for the innocence of adults, for the freedom of imagination and for the right to memory…"&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"/&gt;

Also set in the Old City, his ''Lamento pentru peștișorul Baltazar'' ("Lament for Baltazar the Little Fish") was authored during the 1940s, but, due to political constraints, was only published in 1968 (when it reportedly failed to be chronicled by any literary magazine). The story, divided into independent chapters which function as discourses, comprises several distinct poems: it opens with a "Song to the Sea", and comprises one in Chimet's series of "Laments".&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"/&gt;

Baltazar, who was defined by Cernat as "the messenger of innocence", is subjected to a trial and has to leave the Old City.  In his adventures, the little fish is confronted with a various composite beings, whose identities are imprecise: ''Noi toți'', which translates as "All of us", ''Mierea Pământului''—"The Honey of the Earth", ''Vreo Doi (Vreo Doi era un șarpe de apă)''—"Twosome (Twosome was a water snake)", ''Căpitanul de trei coți lungime, de trei coți lățime''—"The three-cubit-long three-cubit-wide captain", ''Prințesa de Satin''—"The Satin Princess" etc.  Cernat paralleled these elements to the [[Theatre of the Absurd|Absurdist]] plays of [[Eugène Ionesco]], as well as to the tradition of [[nonsense verse]] in [[English literature]].  He likened the wordplays and intricate [[calligraphy]] associated with the characters and plot to the [[Lettrism|Lettrist]] experiments, and the themes they alluded to with those present in some later works by Romanian poet [[Marin Sorescu]].  Thus, he proposed that an episode marking the mythological age of Chimet's sea realm, where a character named Arghir asks a whale to swallow him, reminded one of Sorescu's poem ''Iona'' (with both of them being reinterpretations of the [[Old Testament]] story of [[Jonah]]).&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"/&gt;

Cernat also noted that the playful atmosphere was doubled by "the diffuse sentiment of absence, estrangement and universal extinguishment".  To illustrate this, he quoted one of Baltazar's lines, accompanied by the narrator's voice: "«To wake up at the earliest hour, with the flowers. To hear their suave virgin-like voices. To see if my hungry and thirsty fish […] have been properly fed. And if all things are as they should, in orchards and in waters, as they should be for ever and ever.» But his fish were gone, as was the good fairy, as was the pond of the water of life, of the water of death. And all of them had gone out of sight. He could hear them neighing and clattering at the gates, far away."&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"/&gt;

One of the most influential works in this series was ''Închide ochii și vei vedea Orașul''. Cernat called it: "a refined musical poem, apparently naïve, unveiling unexpected depths to the reader, through the means of shared asides" and "an open game of fantasy filled with love for all that exists, where reality fades into the genuine fantastic of an eternal childhood's unreality, hardly shadowed by [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]."&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; The story centers on a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] city (based on Chimet's vision of Galați),&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; which is disputed between the orange-colored [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]s who live in the "[[labyrinth]] forest" and the [[shapeshifting]] [[ogre]] Gagafu, who is assisted by an evil cat named Sultan.  The latter two twice kidnap Eli, a girl who serves as protector of the city and is introduced as the narrator's daughter: she is ultimately rescued by the dwarfs, who transport her to their forest; Elli pines for her home, and the dwarfs ultimately decide to let her return.  Melancholy, sad musings, and reflections about the fragility of existence are present throughout the book; at one point toward the end of the story, Chimet's narrator confesses: "And then I withdrew, tiptoeing, to my canopy in the garden and I asked myself, sitting alone, what the sense of all these events was. And it seemed to me that I discovered it. And I flinched. And I perked up my ears, believing that I heard unheard footsteps outside or the flapping of wings in the sky. But there was no such thing."&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt;

In ''Cele 12 luni...'', an anthology for the benefit of young readers, Chimet honored fellow children's writer and avant-garde fantasy authors; the authors quoted include Carroll, Ionesco, Saint Exupéry, [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Tudor Arghezi]], [[Ion Creangă]], [[Alfred Jarry]], [[Henri Michaux]], [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Urmuz]], [[Tiberiu Utan]] etc.&lt;ref name="mdsubvers"/&gt; Chimet's own piece was ''Lamento cu o mare baaaaalenă'' ("Lament with One Big Whaaaaale") seen by critic Marina Debattista as a sample of Chimet's mix of "the hero narrative" and "tiny Surrealist poems" into a single original format.&lt;ref name="mdsubvers"/&gt;

The book was richly illustrated, mostly with samples of Surrealist art, from [[Paul Klee]] to [[Max Ernst]].&lt;ref name="mdsubvers"/&gt; It also hosted unusual collages of literary contributions by [[Christian Pineau]] and drawings by Arghezi, [[Mateiu Caragiale]], [[Franz Kafka]] or [[Federico García Lorca]].&lt;ref name="mdsubvers"/&gt; Commenting on the anthology's subversive content, Marina Debattista noted: "The reader is discreetly engaged into practicing a form of Surrealism, which temporarily frees him from the clutches of reality. The latter effect is significant for the context in which 'The Anthology of Innocence' saw print: in 1970s Romania, the [[wooden language]], like some acid, insidious sea, eroded spirits and clamped down on their natural opening for the miraculous."&lt;ref name="mdsubvers"/&gt;

==Legacy==
For long after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]], Chimet's work remained unknown to the local public.  Paul Cernat noted that, when the [[Romanian Democratic Convention|Democratic Convention]] governments allowed private publishing houses to issue school textbooks of Romanian literature, Iordan Chimet's were made more available to schoolchildren.  He also recorded that, since the new educational approaches favored familiarizing students with works of universal and [[History of modern literature|modern literature]] at the detriment of local classics, Chimet was the subject of attacks in the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] press (who listed Chimet, alongside authors such as Ende, [[Edward Lear]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Mircea Horia Simionescu]], not worthy of inclusion in the textbooks).&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt;

In 2000, ''Lamento pentru peștișorul Baltazar'' was reprinted in a Romanian-German bilingual edition, with assistance from the [[Goethe-Institut]].  The volume was illustrated with drawings made for this purpose by some of Chimet's friends: the writers Ionesco, [[Claude Aveline]], [[Richard Bach]], [[Emilio Breda]], [[Odysseas Elytis]], and the Mexican visual artists [[Juan Soriano]] and [[José Garcia Ocejo]].&lt;ref name="cernatbalt"/&gt;

It is believed that ''Închide ochii și vei vedea Orașul'' inspired various aspects of Michael Ende's ''[[The Neverending Story]]''&lt;ref name="ghetquij"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dumitrescu40"/&gt; and that, in Ende's ''Das Gauklermärchen'' ("The Juggler's Tale"), Chimet's Elli became Eli, a simple and poor girl who believes herself a princess.&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; The Chimet-Ende correspondence was published as a book in 1999.&lt;ref name="cernatscris"/&gt; In 2006-2007, Chimet also published two volumes of the letters he exchanged with various other authors, including Ursu and [[Camil Baciu]], under the title ''Cartea prietenilor mei'' ("My Friends' Book").&lt;ref name="aursuchimet"/&gt; Following a [[Romanian Writers' Union]] initiative, a memorial plaque was placed at his apartment bloc in [[Titan, Bucharest|Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.uniuneascriitorilor.ro/noutati.html ''Iniţiativă importantă a U.S.R.

'''Jan Białostocki''' (born August 14, 1921 in [[Saratov]], [[Russia]]; died December 25, 1988 in [[Warsaw]]) was one of the most famous&lt;ref&gt;According to Maria Poprzęcka, he was "one of the greatest scholars and humanists of our time" and had "world fame". See [http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/2771/1/Poprzecka_A_reminiscence_about_Jan_Bialostocki_1991.pdf Maria Poprzęcka, "A reminiscence about Jan Białostocki (1921-1988)", ''Polish Art Studies'', 12 (1991), pp. 251-253]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poland|Polish]] [[art historian]]s of the 20th century.

==Life and work==
During the German [[Occupation of Poland (1939–45)]], Białostocki studied at the so-called "Secret University of Warsaw" [[philosophy]] and [[art history]] under [[Wladyslaw Tatarkiewicz]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] and [[Michał Walicki]]. From September 1944 to May 1945 he was a prisoner in several German [[concentration camp]]s. After [[World War II]] he worked for about ten years as an assistant at the [[National Museum, Warsaw]] and from 1956 on, he directed the museum's art gallery. From 1945 on, he also worked at the [[University of Warsaw]], first as an assistant at the Department of Medieval Art, then as a lecturer. In 1962 he was appointed professor of art history.

Since 1964 Białostocki was a member of the [[Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art]], since 1973 a member of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] of [[Princeton University]]. He lectured at numerous academic institutions and museums in many European countries, the USA and Mexico, for instance, at [[Princeton University]] (1958), [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] (1965-1966),&lt;ref&gt;Jan Białostocki, "Ars Auro Prior". In Jean G. Harrell and Alina Wierzbiańska, eds., ''Aesthetics in Twentieth-century Poland: Selected Essays''. Cranbury, New Jersey 1973, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York University]] (1972), the [[University of Wisconsin]] (1972), the [[Pennsylvania State University]] (1973), the [[Collège de France]] (1978) and the [[University of Cambridge]] (1984-1985).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoart.cam.ac.uk/aboutthedept/sladeprofs/sladeprofs/jb1234@cam.ac.uk Jan Bialostocki: Slade Professor from 1984-85]&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated in the Twentieth International Congress for the History of Art in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opac.regesta-imperii.de/lang_en/anzeige.php?sammelwerk=Studies+in+Western+art.+Acts+of+the+Twentieth+International+Congress+of+the+History+of+Art	Studies in Western Art: Acts of the Twentieth International Congress of the History of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 he was awarded the first ever [[Aby Warburg Prize]] of [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamburg.de/kulturbehoerde/kulturpreise/3605240/aby-m-warburg-preis/ Abi Warburg-Preis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220082314/http://www.hamburg.de/kulturbehoerde/kulturpreise/3605240/aby-m-warburg-preis/ |date=2015-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Białostocki's research interests were exceptionally broad and included the art of the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]], [[Rembrandt]] and the Dutch seventeenth century, [[Romanticism]], [[history painting]], the history of art doctrines, and methodological questions of the history of art. According to Józef Grabski, he "tried to instill in his students a need for a broad perspective when looking at a particular work of art. He was, in a way, an intellectual son of Erwin Panofsky. Prof. Białostocki directed the attention of his students to the wide context of every work of art: social, psychological, archival, but also historical, economica, as well as purely artistic. [...] He tried to show us the art historical research not only as pure history of art, but in connection with other humanist disciplines."&lt;ref&gt;[http://irsa.com.pl/news/2015/02/the-35th-anniversary-of-the-irsa-institute-for-art-historical-researc The 35th Anniversary of the IRSA Institute for Art Historical Research]&lt;/ref&gt; He has published more than 600 publications in several languages mainly on art from the Renaissance to the 18th century.

Białostocki was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002364 |title=Jan Bialostocki (1921 - 1988) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kamil Václav Zvelebil''' (September 17, 1927 – January 17, 2009) was a distinguished [[Czechs|Czech]] scholar in Indian [[literature]] and [[linguistics]], notably [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] [[linguistics]] and literature and [[philology]].

== Life and career ==
Zvelebil studied at the [[Charles University in Prague]] from 1946 to 1952 where he majored in [[Indology]], English language, literature and philosophy. After obtaining his Ph.D in 1952 and until 1970 he was a senior research fellow in Tamil and Dravidian linguistics and literature at the [[Oriental Institute, ASCR|Oriental Institute]] of the [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]]. He held the role of associate professor of Tamil and Dravidian at Charles University in Prague until 1968, when he and his family (including his son, the later archaeologist, [[Marek Zvelebil]]) were forced to flee after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. They fled to the United States at first, but later settled in the Netherlands.

During the late 1960s, he made many field trips including those to South India. From 1965 to 1966, he was a temporary professor in Dravidian studies at the [[University of Chicago]] in the United States and was a visiting professor at [[Heidelberg University]] between 1967 and 1968. Furthermore, he is very well known among the Tamil Nadu and has earnt a permanent place in the educational syllabus of the Dravidian states.

In 1970, after more time at the [[University of Chicago]], he was a visiting professor at the [[Collège de France]] in Paris. After more travel through European universities he became the professor of Dravidian linguistics and South Indian literature and culture at [[Utrecht University]] until his retirement in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketaz.co.uk/Zveleb1.html Prof. Dr. K.V.

To take land values for public purposes is not really to impose a tax, but to take for public purposes a value created by the community. And out of the fund which would thus accrue from the common property, we might, without degradation to anybody, provide enough to actually secure from want all who were deprived of their natural protectors or met with accident, or any man who should grow so old that he could not work. All prating that is heard from some quarters about its hurting the common people to give them what they do not work for is humbug. The truth is, that anything that injures self-respect, degrades, does harm; but if you give it as a right, as something to which every citizen is entitled to, it does not degrade. Charity schools do degrade children that are sent to them, but public schools do not.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=George|first=Henry|date=1871|title=Our Land and Land Policy, National and State|url=https://archive.org/details/ourlandandlandp00georgoog|publisher=White &amp; Bauer [etc.]|page=230|isbn=9781230444703|author-link=Henry George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manualism Hand Music.jpg|right|thumb|'''Manualism:''' Squeezing air through the hands to play musical notes]]'''Manualism''' is the art of playing music by squeezing air through the hands. Because the sound produced has a distinctly [[flatulence|flatulent]] tone, such music is usually presented as a form of musical comedy or [[parody]]. The musical performer is called a [[wiktionary:manualist|manualist]], who may perform [[a cappella]] or with instrumental accompaniment.

Playing recognizable tunes by squeezing the hands together is extremely difficult, and could take many years of practice to master the art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www13.pair.com/handman/hands.htm The Manualism Page], by Gaston and Purcell&lt;/ref&gt; Some manualists practice for as many as 30 years before finally reaching a presentable level of proficiency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Technique==
Just as a [[trumpeter]] makes sound by blowing air between the lips, a manualist makes sound by squeezing air between two hands.

The hands are held together, trapping a pocket of air between the two palms.&lt;ref name="WilsonRadioInterview"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5579711 R. A. Wilson radio interview], "Hand Music: No Manual Needed", NPR: Morning Edition, July 25, 2006 (text and audio)&lt;/ref&gt; Using the fingers of one hand, the air is squeezed out the top, between the base of the thumb and the opposite hand, to form a [[musical note]]. The pitch is determined by the force used to hold the hands together. The tighter the grip, the higher the note.&lt;ref name="WilsonTVInterview"&gt;[http://www.tvland.com/video/index.jhtml?bcpid=192878568&amp;bclid=207371517&amp;bctid=207371516 R. A. Wilson video interview], "An Interview with R. A. Wilson, Manualist", TVLand (video)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bass notes may be produced by squeezing the air pocket out the opposite side, near the [[pinky finger]].

Even with years of practice, manualism is very difficult to control. It may be one of the hardest "instruments" in the world to play, and live stage performances are extremely rare.

==Historical references==
Records of manualists performing the art prior to the 20th Century have yet to be discovered, though it seems likely that someone must have attempted to make music in this fashion from the earliest days of musical parody.

===The first documented manualist===
A [[Universal Studios]] [[newsreel]] from 1933&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/1933-10-11_Farmer_Plays_Tune_With_Hands Cecil Dill performing ''Yankee Doodle''], Universal Studios Newsreel, 1933 (video)&lt;/ref&gt; may be the oldest filmed record of a manualist performing the art. The footage documents a farmer named '''Cecil Dill''' from [[Traverse City]], [[Michigan]], who claims that he first learned to play "[[Yankee Doodle]]" in 1914.

===John Twomey===
In 1974, '''[[John Twomey (musician)|John Twomey]]''', a successful Grand Rapids, Michigan attorney, performed "[[Stars and Stripes Forever]]" on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' . This performance was seen by several million people in the United States, not only in 1974, but annually for many years thereafter, as the segment was repeated many times on the annual ''Best of Carson'' shows. It is also included in the ''Best of [[Johnny Carson]]'' collection.&lt;ref&gt;''The Best of [[Johnny Carson]] Collection'', Volume 1, Title 2, Chapter 23 (DVD)&lt;/ref&gt;

Twomey introduced himself as "a manualist", perhaps the first use of the term in a musical context. He appeared on several other programs including ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' where he performed the "[[Colonel Bogey March]]," made famous in the film ''[[The Bridge Over the River Kwai]]'', and ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' where he performed "[[When the Saints Go Marching In]]."  He provided audio for the [[Barney Miller]] episode "The Dentist," first aired December 27, 1979, in which a manualist musician is hauled in for disturbing the peace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519114/ Barney Miller - "The Dentist"], [[IMDb]]&lt;/ref&gt;

John Twomey's last public performance was on November 21, 1998 on the radio show ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' with [[Garrison Keillor]], where he performed "[[Stardust (song)|Stardust]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/19981121 John Twomey performing ''Stardust''], National Public Radio, "A Prairie Home Companion", November 21, 1998 (audio)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marilyn French''' (née ''Edwards'') (November 21, 1929{{spaced ndash}}May 2, 2009) was a radical feminist American [[author]].

==Early life and education==
French was born in [[Brooklyn]] to E. Charles Edwards, an engineer, and Isabel Hazz Edwards, a department store clerk. In her youth, she was a young journalist, writing a neighborhood newsletter. She played the piano and dreamed of becoming a composer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the Name of Friendship|last=French|first=Marilyn|publisher=The Feminist Press at the City University of New York|year=2005|isbn=978-1-55861-520-5|location=New York|pages=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a bachelor's degree from [[Hofstra University]] (then [[Hofstra College]]) in 1951, in philosophy and English literature.  Marilyn Edwards married Robert M. French Jr. in 1950 and supported him while he attended law school. The couple had two children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; French also received a master's degree in English from Hofstra, in 1964.  She divorced Robert French in 1967 and then pursued a doctorate&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; at [[Harvard University]], where she earned a Ph.D in 1972.&lt;ref name=kirjasto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mfrench.htm |title=Marilyn French |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327225226/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/mfrench.htm |archivedate=27 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Teaching===
She was an English instructor at Hofstra, from 1964 to 1968, and was an assistant professor of English at the [[College of the Holy Cross]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], from 1972 to 1976.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/04/arts/04french.html | work=The New York Times | first1=A. G. | last1=Sulzberger | first2=Herbert | last2=Mitgang | title=Marilyn French, Novelist and Champion of Feminism, Dies at 79 | date=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views and written works===
French's first serious publication, ''The Book as World: James Joyce's Ulysses,'' was her Harvard thesis.&lt;ref name=kirjasto /&gt;

In her work, French asserted that women's oppression is an intrinsic part of the male-dominated global culture. For instance, one of her first non-fiction works, ''Beyond Power: On Women, Men and Morals'' (1985), is a historical examination of the effects of [[patriarchy]] on the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} French took issue with the expectations of married women in the post-World War II era and became a leading, if controversial, opinion maker on gender issues who decried the [[patriarchal]] society she saw around her. "My goal in life is to change the entire social and economic structure of Western civilization, to make it a feminist world," she once declared.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

French's first and best-known novel, ''[[The Women's Room]]'' (1977), follows the lives of Mira and her friends in 1950s and 1960s America, including Val, a militant [[radical feminist]]. The novel portrays the details of the lives of women at this time and the [[feminist movement]] of this era in the United States. At one point in the book the character Val says, "all men are rapists, and that's all they are. They rape us with their eyes, their laws, and their codes."&lt;ref name=kirjasto /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=French |first1=Marilyn |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |title=[[The Women's Room]] |year=1977 |isbn=0-345-35361-7 |at=Book 5. Chapter 19 |quote=" — [...] Whatever they may be in public life, whatever their relations with men, in their relations with women, all men are rapists, and that's all they are. They rape us with their eyes, their laws, and their codes."}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Women's Room'' sold more than 20 million copies and was translated into 20 languages.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} [[Gloria Steinem]], a close friend, compared the impact of the book on the discussion surrounding women's rights to the one that [[Ralph Ellison]]'s ''[[Invisible Man]]'' (1952) had had on racial equality 25 years earlier.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Her most significant work in later life was ''From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women''. It was published in a Dutch translation in 1995 (in one volume of 1312 pages),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Een vrouwelijk geschiedenis van de wereld|language=Dutch|authors=French, Marilyn &amp; Franken, Viviane e.a. (Translator)| location=Amsterdam|publisher= Meulenhoff|date= 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not appear in English until 2002 and 2003 (published in three volumes by Mcarthur &amp; Company), and then again in English in four volumes (published by [[The Feminist Press]]) in 2008. It is built around the premise that exclusion from the prevailing intellectual histories denied women their past, present and future.  Despite carefully chronicling a long history of oppression, the last volume ends on an optimistic note, said [[Florence Howe]], who recently retired as director of the publishing house. "For the first time women have history," she said of Ms. French's work. "The world changed and she helped change it."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

While French was pleased by significant gains made by women in the three decades since her landmark novel, ''The Women's Room'', she was also just as quick to point out lingering deficiencies in gender equality.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

==Personal life, health, and death==
She married Robert M. French Jr., in 1950. They had two children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The couple divorced in 1967.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

French was diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer]] in 1992. This experience was the basis for her book ''A Season in Hell: A Memoir'' (1998). She survived cancer and later died from heart failure at age 79, on May 2, 2009, in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
*Marilyn French is mentioned in [[ABBA]]'s song "[[The Day Before You Came]]" ([[1982 in music|1982]]), in the lyric: "I must have read a while, the latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=MetroLyrics.com|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-day-before-you-came-lyrics-abba.html|title=The Day Before You Came Lyrics (from the Definitive Edition)|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}, and the video clip for the song vaguely reflects the strangers-meeting-on-a-train plot of The Bleeding Heart&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Primemeridian.jpg|thumb|300px|Meridians run between the North and South poles.]]
A ('''geographical''') '''meridian''' (or '''line of longitude''') is the half of an imaginary [[great circle]] on the Earth's surface, terminated by the [[North Pole]] and the [[South Pole]], connecting points of equal [[longitude]], as measured in angular degrees east or west of the Prime Meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=“Absurd Vanity”: The World&amp;#x2019;s Prime Meridians before c. 1790|date=2017|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1n2ttsj.6|work=Zero Degrees|pages=25–72|editor-last=WITHERS|editor-first=CHARLES W. J.|series=Geographies of the Prime Meridian|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674088818|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of a point along the meridian is given by that longitude and its [[latitude]], measured in angular degrees north or south of the [[Equator]]. Each meridian is perpendicular to all [[circle of latitude|circles of latitude]]. Each is also the same length, being half of a great circle on the Earth's surface and therefore measuring 20,003.93&amp;nbsp;km (12,429.9 miles).

== Pre-Greenwich ==
The first prime meridian was set by [[Eratosthenes]] in 276 BCE. This prime meridian was used to provide measurement of the earth, but had many issues because of the lack of latitude measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=“Absurd Vanity”: The World&amp;#x2019;s Prime Meridians before c. 1790|date=2017|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1n2ttsj.6|work=Zero Degrees|pages=25–72|editor-last=WITHERS|editor-first=CHARLES W. J.|series=Geographies of the Prime Meridian|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674088818|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later around the 19th century there was still concerns of the prime meridian. The idea of having one prime meridian came from [[William Parker Snow]], because he realized the confusion of having multiple prime meridian locations. Many of theses geographical locations were traced back to the ancient Greeks, and others were created by several nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=PROLOGUE|date=2017|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1n2ttsj.4|work=Zero Degrees|pages=1–4|editor-last=WITHERS|editor-first=CHARLES W. J.|series=Geographies of the Prime Meridian|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674088818|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple locations for the geographical meridian meant that there was inconsistency, because each country had their own guidelines for where the prime meridian was located.

==Etymology==
The term ''meridian'' comes from the Latin ''meridies'', meaning "midday"; the [[subsolar point]] passes through a given meridian at solar [[noon]], midway between the times of sunrise and sunset on that meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qnQDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=The+term+%22meridian%22+comes+from+the+Latin+meridies,+meaning+%22midday%22;+th&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=23Ptfdvd3h&amp;sig=frtap1TC1R4OuIo5KJ9i5sTuBZ8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMqqTTg8HcAhUQLHwKHRbiBL4Q6AEwDXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20term%20%22meridian%22%20comes%20from%20the%20Latin%20meridies,%20meaning%20%22midday%22;%20th&amp;f=false|title=First Teachings about the Earth; its lands and waters; its countries and States, etc|last=|first=|date=1870|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Sun]] crosses the [[meridian (astronomy)|celestial meridian]] at the same time. The same Latin stem gives rise to the terms [[12-hour clock|a.m. (ante meridiem) and p.m. (post meridiem)]] used to disambiguate hours of the day when utilizing the [[12-hour clock]].

== Geographic ==
[[File:Prime_meridian.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Prime_meridian.jpg|right|thumb|The astronomic prime meridian at Greenwich, England. The geodetic prime meridian is actually 102.478 meters east of this point since the adoption of [[WGS84]].]]Toward the ending of the 19th century there were two main locations that were acknowledged as the geographic location of the meridian, France and Britain. These two locations often conflicted and a settlement was reached only after there was an International Meridian Conference held, in which Greenwich was recognized as the 0° location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ruling Space, Fixing Time|date=2017|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1n2ttsj.12|work=Zero Degrees|pages=263–274|editor-last=WITHERS|editor-first=CHARLES W.

The meridian through [[Royal Greenwich Observatory|Greenwich (inside Greenwich Park)]], England, called the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Prime Meridian]], was set at zero degrees of longitude, while other meridians were defined by the angle at the center of the earth between where it and the prime meridian cross the equator.  As there are 360 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] in a circle, the meridian on the opposite side of the earth from Greenwich, the antimeridian, forms the other half of a circle with the one through Greenwich, and is at  [[180° longitude]]  near the [[International Date Line]] (with land mass and island deviations for boundary reasons). The meridians from West of Greenwich (0°) to the antimeridian (180°) define the [[Western Hemisphere]] and the meridians from East of Greenwich (0°) to the antimeridian (180°) define the [[Eastern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-the-prime-meridian-definition-facts-location.html|title=What is the Prime Meridian? - Definition, Facts &amp; Location - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=study.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|certain=|date=July 2018}}  Most maps show the lines of longitude.

The position of the prime meridian has changed a few times throughout history, mainly due to the transit observatory being built next door to the previous one (to maintain the service to shipping). Such changes had no significant practical effect. Historically, the average error in the determination of longitude was much larger than the change in position. The adoption of [[WGS84]] ("World Geodetic System 84") as the positioning system has moved the [[Satellite geodesy|geodetic]] prime meridian 102.478 metres east of its last [[Geodetic astronomy|astronomic]] position (measured at Greenwich).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-09-22|title=A&amp;G Volume 56 Issue 5, Full Issue|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/astrogeo/atv173|journal=Astronomy &amp; Geophysics|language=en|volume=56|issue=5|pages=ASTROG|doi=10.1093/astrogeo/atv173|issn=1366-8781}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The position of the current geodetic prime meridian is not identified at all by any kind of sign or marking (as the older astronomic position was) in Greenwich,  but can be located using a GPS receiver.

== Impact of Prime Meridian ( Greenwich Time) ==
It was in the best interests of the nations to agree to one standard meridian to benefit their fast growing economy and production. The disorganized system they had before was not sufficient for their increasing mobility. The coach services in England had erratic timing before the GWT. U.S. and Canada were also improving their railroad system and needed a standard time as well. With a standard meridian, stage coach and trains were able to be more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1976-01-01|title=Greenwich time and the prime meridian|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0083665676900398|journal=Vistas in Astronomy|language=en|volume=20|pages=219–229|doi=10.1016/0083-6656(76)90039-8|issn=0083-6656}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument of which meridian is more scientific was set aside in order to find the most convenient for practical reasons. They were also able to agree that the universal day was going to be the mean solar day. They agreed that the days would begin at midnight and the universal day would not impact the use of local time. In the "Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada a report was submitted, dated 10 May 1894; on the Unification of the Astronomical, Civil and Nautical Days" it states that:

'''civil day'''- begins at midnight and ends at midnight following

'''astronomical day'''- begins at noon of civil day and continue until following noon

'''nautical day'''- concludes at noon of civil day, starting at preceding noon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1976-01-01|title=Greenwich time and the prime meridian|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0083665676900398|journal=Vistas in Astronomy|language=en|volume=20|pages=219–229|doi=10.1016/0083-6656(76)90039-8|issn=0083-6656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Magnetic Meridian ==
The '''magnetic meridian''' is an equivalent imaginary line connecting the magnetic [[South magnetic pole|south]] and [[North magnetic pole|north poles]] and can be taken as the horizontal [[Component (vector)|component]] of magnetic force lines along the surface of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=8&amp;sid=91d6805f-0515-4459-b829-049879336d9c@sessionmgr120|title=Induction effects of geomagnetic disturbances in the geo-electric field var...: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a compass needle will be parallel to the magnetic meridian. However, a compass needle will not be steady in the magnetic meridian, because of the longitude from east to west being complete [[geodesic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haughton|first=Graves C.|date=1843|title=On the Relative Dynamic Value of the Degrees of the Compass; and on the Cause of the Needle Resting in the Magnetic Meridian.

== True Meridian ==
The '''true meridian''' is the plane that passes through true north poles and true south poles at the spot of the observer. The difference between true meridian and magnetic meridian is that the true meridian is fixed while the magnetic meridian is formed through the movement of the needle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-true-meridian-and-vs-magnetic-meridian/|title=Difference Between True Meridian and Magnetic Meridian - DifferenceBetween.com|date=2011-08-14|work=DifferenceBetween.com|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|date=July 2018}} True bearing is the horizontal angle between true meridian and a line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-is-true-meridian|title=What is true meridian? - Quora|last=maneesh|first=kumar|date=|website=www.quora.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|date=July 2018}} Henry D. Thoreau classified this true meridian versus the magnetic meridian in order to have a more qualitative, intuitive, and abstract function. He used the true meridian since his compass varied by a few degrees. There were some variations. When he noted the sight line for the True Meridian from his family's house to the depot, he could check the declination of his compass before and after surveying throughout the day. He noted this variation down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLean|first=Albert F.|date=1968|title=Thoreau's True Meridian: Natural Fact and Metaphor|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2711017|journal=American Quarterly|volume=20|issue=3|pages=567–579|doi=10.2307/2711017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meridian Passage ==
The '''meridian passage''' is the moment when a celestial object passes the meridian of longitude of the observer. At this point, the celestial object is at its highest point.  When the sun passes two times an altitude while rising and setting can be averaged to give the time of meridian passage. Navigators utilized the sun’s declination and the sun’s altitude at local meridian passage, in order to calculate their latitude with the formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huth|first=John|date=2013|title=Lost Art of Finding Our Way|url=|journal=Cambridge: Harvard University Press|volume=|pages=99–200|via=ProQuest Ebook Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latitude = (90o – noon altitude + declination)

The declination of major stars are their angles north and south from the celestial equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huth|first1=John|date=2013|title=Lost Art of Finding Our Way|journal=Cambridge; Harvard University Press|volume=|pages=|pmid=|via=ProQuest Ebook Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that  the Meridian passage will not occur exactly at 12 hours because of the inclination of the earth. The meridian passage can occur within a few minutes of variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.myseatime.com/discussion/what-is-the-difference-of-noon-position-and-meridian-passage|title=What is the difference of noon position and meridian passage? - MySeaTime|last=Jassal|first=Reeve|date=|website=www.myseatime.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement of Earth Rotation ==
Many of these instruments rely on the ability to measure the longitude and latitude of the earth. These instruments also were typically effected by local gravity, which paired well with existing technologies such as the magnetic meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malys|first=Stephen|last2=Seago|first2=John H.|last3=Pavlis|first3=Nikolaos K.|last4=Seidelmann|first4=P.

'''Michif''' (also '''Mitchif''', '''Mechif''', '''Michif-Cree''', '''Métif''', '''Métchif''', '''French Cree''') is the [[language]] of the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis people of Canada]] and the [[Métis people (United States)|United States]], who are the descendants of [[First Nations]] women (mainly [[Cree]], [[Nakota]], and [[Ojibwe]]) and [[fur trade]] workers of European ancestry (mainly [[French Canadians|French]] and [[Scottish Canadians]]). Currently, Michif is spoken in scattered Métis communities in the provinces of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] in Canada and in [[North Dakota]] in the U.S., with about 50 speakers in [[Alberta]], all over age 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted a consistent character between about 1820 and 1840.

Michif combines [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[Métis French]] (Rhodes 1977, Bakker 1997:85), a variety of [[Canadian French]], with some additional borrowing from [[English language|English]] and [[indigenous languages of the Americas]] such as [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] and [[Assiniboine language|Assiniboine]]. In general, Michif [[noun phrase]] [[phonology]], [[lexicon]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and [[syntax]] are derived from Métis French, while [[verb phrase]] phonology, lexicon, morphology, and syntax are from a southern variety of [[Plains Cree]]. (Plains Cree is a western dialect of Cree.) Articles and adjectives are also of Métis French origin but demonstratives are from Plains Cree.

The Michif language was first brought to scholarly attention in 1976 by John Crawford at the [[University of North Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;Michif: A new language. ''North Dakota English'' 4.1:3-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the subsequent research on Michif was also related to UND, including four more pieces by Crawford, plus work by Evans, Rhodes, and Weaver.

The Michif language is unusual (and possibly even unique) among [[mixed language]]s, in that rather than forming a simplified grammar, it developed by incorporating complex elements of the chief languages from which it was born. French-origin noun phrases retain lexical [[grammatical gender|gender]] and adjective agreement; Cree-origin verbs retain much of their [[polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]] structure. This suggests that instead of haltingly using words from another's tongue, the people who gradually came to speak Michif were fully fluent in both French and Cree.

The number of speakers is estimated at fewer than 1,000; it was probably double or triple this number at the close of the 19th century, but never much higher.

==Phonology==
Michif as recorded starting in the 1970s combined two separate phonological systems: one for French origin elements, and one for Cree origin elements (Rhodes 1977, 1986). For instance, /y/, /l/, /r/ and /f/ exist only in French words, whereas [[Preaspiration|preaspirated]] stops such as {{IPA|/ʰt/}} and {{IPA|/ʰk/}} exist only in Cree words. In this variety of Michif, the French elements were pronounced in ways that have distinctively Canadian French values for the vowels, while the Cree elements have distinctively Cree values for vowels. Nonetheless, there is some Cree influence on French words in the stress system (Rosen 2006). But by the year 2000 there were Michif speakers who had collapsed the two systems into a single system (Rosen 2007).

===Vowels===

Michif has eleven oral vowels and four nasalized vowels.

====Nasalized Vowels====

The following four vowels are nasalized in Michif:

* {{IPA|/ĩ/}}
* {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}}
* {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}}
* {{IPA|/ɑ̃/}}

===Schwa-Deletion===
A [[schwa]] /ə/ appearing between two [[consonant]]s in French-origin words is dropped in Michif. Examples of this process are listed in the table below.

===Liaison consonants===
In French, a [[Liaison (French)|liaison]] is used to bridge the gap between word-final and word-initial vowel sounds. This process does not occur in Michif, though some remnants of it are evident. For many nouns, liaison consonants become integrated into the noun itself.

Adjectives are French-origin (Cree has no adjectives), and as in French they are either pre- or postnominal. Prenominal adjectives agree in gender (like French), however, postnominal adjectives do not agree in gender (unlike French).

===Verb phrase===
The verb phrase is that of Plains Cree-origin with little reduction (there are no dubitative or preterit verb forms).

===Word order===
Michif word order is basically that of Cree (relatively free). However, the more French-origin elements are used, the closer the syntax seems to conform to norms of spoken French.

==Lexicon==
Nouns: 			83-94% French-origin; others are mostly Cree-origin, Ojibwe-origin, or English-origin&lt;br /&gt;
Verbs: 		88-99% Cree-origin&lt;br /&gt;
Question words: Cree-origin&lt;br /&gt;
Personal pronouns: Cree&lt;br /&gt;
Postpositions: Cree-origin&lt;br /&gt;
Prepositions: French-origin&lt;br /&gt;
Conjunctions: 55% Cree-origin; 40% French-origin&lt;br /&gt;
Numerals: French-origin&lt;br /&gt;
Demonstratives: Cree-origin

==Language genesis==
[[File:Engraving at Batoche Cemetery (Michif version).jpg|thumb|Michif engraving at [[Batoche, Saskatchewan|Batoche]]]]
In languages of mixed ethnicities, the language of the mother usually provides the grammatical system, while the language of the father provides the lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, Peter. ''A Language of Our Own: The Genesis of Michif, the Mixed Cree-French Language of the Canadian Metis'', Oxford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons are as follows: children tend to know their mother’s language better;{{dubious|date=October 2017}}&lt;!-- what about Father-Tongue hypothesis--&gt; in the case of the Métis, the men were often immigrants, whereas the women were native to the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} If the bilingual children need to use either of their parents’ languages to converse with outsiders, it is most likely to be the language of their mothers. Thus, the model of language-mixing predicts that Michif should have a Cree grammatical system and French lexicon. However, in reality, Michif has Cree verb phrases and French noun phrases. The explanation for this unusual distribution of Cree and French elements in Michif lies in the polysynthetic nature of Cree morphology. In Cree, verbs can be very complex with up to twenty morphemes, incorporated nouns and unclear boundaries between morphemes. In other words, in Cree verbs it is very difficult to separate grammar from lexicon. As a result, in Michif the grammatical and bound elements are almost all Cree, and the lexical and free elements are almost all French; verbs are almost totally Cree, because the verb consists of grammatical and bound elements. Seen in this way, it can be argued that Michif is fundamentally Cree, but with heavy French borrowing (somewhat like [[Maltese language|Maltese]], a mixed Arabic-Italian language classified as fundamentally Arabic).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3852">[[Image:Mschatta-Fassade (Pergamonmuseum).jpg|thumb|300px|Mshatta Facade]]
'''The Mshatta Facade''' is the decorated part of the [[facade]] of the 8th century [[Umayyad]] residential palace of [[Qasr Mshatta]], one of the [[Desert Castles of Jordan]], which is now installed in the south wing of the [[Pergamon Museum]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It is part of the permanent exhibition of the [[Pergamon Museum of Islamic Art]] dedicated to [[Islamic art]] from the 8th to the 19th centuries.  This was only a relatively small section of the full length of the facade, surrounding the main entrance; most of the wall was undecorated and remains ''in situ''.

==History==
[[File:Pergamon Museum Berlin 2007131.jpg|thumb|left|detail]]
The facade belonged to the Qasr Mshatta or Mshatta palace, which was excavated about 30&amp;nbsp;km south of the contemporary Jordanian capital of [[Amman]]. It is thought to have served as a winter residence and storage halls during the [[Umayyad]] period. The building of the palace probably dates to the era of the [[caliph]] [[Al-Walid II]] (743-744). After Al Walid was murdered, it was left incomplete and later ruined in an [[earthquake]].  The sections of the outer wall remaining ''in situ'' are much plainer.

Unusually for an Umayyad building, the main structures are built from burnt bricks resting on a foundation layer of finely dressed stone; the carved facade is also in stone. The name of the place, Mshatta, is a name used by the modern [[Bedouin]]s in the area, and the original name remains unknown.

The remains of the palace were excavated in 1840. The facade was a gift from the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany]]. A large part of it was brought to the then [[Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]] (now the [[Bode Museum]]) in Berlin in 1903. It was reconstructed as a 33 metres long, 5 metres high facade, with two towers, and parts of a central gateway.  In 1932 it was reconstructed in the Pergamon Museum. It was seriously damaged during the Second World War and the bombardment of Berlin. Today, it is one of the most important exhibits of the ''Museum für Islamische Kunst'' in the [[Pergamon Museum]], and a key monument of early [[Islamic art]] and architecture, demonstrating early forms of the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], [[millefleur]] and also animals carved in [[relief]].

There has been much discussion of the fact that the decoration on the left side of the facade contains many animals among the foliar forms, while on the right of the entranceway in the centre there are no animals. It has been suggested that this is because the right-hand side was the outside wall of the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ettinghausen, [[Oleg Grabar]] and Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, 2001, ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650-1250'', 50, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-08869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:6 Av 44 St debt clock Feb 2017.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Photo of the National Debt Clock at Sixth Avenue and 44th Street, at which time it read $19.9 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] in national debt|The clock at its former location near Sixth Avenue and 44th Street in February 2017, at which time it read $19.9 trillion in national debt]]

The '''National Debt Clock''' is a billboard-sized [[running total]] [[Segment display#Segment displays|display]] which constantly updates to show the current [[United States public debt|United States gross national debt]] and each American family's share of the debt.  It is currently installed on the western side of [[Bank of America Tower (Manhattan)|One Bryant Park]], west of [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] between [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd]] and 43rd Streets in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. It was the first [[debt clock]] installed anywhere.

The idea for the clock came from New York real estate developer [[Seymour Durst]], who wanted to highlight the rising national debt. In 1989, he sponsored the installation of the first clock, which was originally placed on Sixth Avenue between 42nd and 43rd Streets, one block away from [[Times Square]]. In 2004, the original clock was dismantled and replaced by a newer clock near 44th Street and Sixth Avenue. In 2008, as the U.S. national debt exceeded $10 trillion for the first time, it was reported that the value of the debt may have exceeded the number of digits in the clock. The lit dollar-sign in the clock's leftmost digit position was later changed to the "1" digit to represent the ten-trillionth place. In 2017, the clock was moved again to One Bryant Park, near its original location.

==Context==
New York real estate developer [[Seymour Durst]], who invented and sponsored the clock, stated that it represents a non-partisan effort and explained the motivation behind the project in terms of [[intergenerational equity]]: "We're a family business. We think generationally, and we don't want to see the next generation crippled by this burden."&lt;ref name="chinadaily"/&gt;

According to Seymour's son Douglas, his father had been toying with the basic idea of drawing attention to the growing national debt since at least 1980, when during the holiday season he sent cards that said "Happy New Year. Your share of the national debt is $35,000" to senators and congressmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/13/nyregion/following-up-time-s-hands-go-back-on-national-debt-clock.html |title=FOLLOWING UP; Time's Hands Go Back On National Debt Clock |last=Koh |first=Eun Lee |date=August 13, 2000 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s, when Seymour first developed the idea of a constantly updated clock, the technology required to implement the project was not yet available.&lt;ref name="chinadaily" /&gt; Back then, the debt was quickly approaching $1 trillion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/08/magazine/sunday-november-8-1998-the-national-debt-depressing-displays.html |title=SUNDAY: NOVEMBER 8, 1998: THE NATIONAL DEBT; Depressing Displays |date=November 8, 1998 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of conveying a message through a periodically updated clock found an earlier expression in the [[Doomsday Clock]]. However, the innovation of the National Debt Clock was to feature a constantly running counter; it has since inspired similar projects elsewhere, both in the United States and further afield.&lt;ref name="NYT 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/debt-clock-moves-next-door-to-government/a-1239561 |title=Debt Clock Moves Next Door to Government |date=June 18, 2004 |newspaper=Deutsche Welle |accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it has become a national fixture shows that the U.S.'s increasing debt. By 1995, the ''New York Times'' reported that politicians were citing the clock to advocate for a reduction to the national budget.&lt;ref name="NYT 1995" /&gt; Various tracking counters of national debt are also kept online.{{efn|1=Examples for online debt tracking resources include:

*[http://www.usdebtclock.org/ National Debt in Real Time]
*[http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/ brillig.com]}}

The National Debt Clock has also been credited as the inspiration behind other running totalizers, for example an [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] campaign employing an electronic billboard; instead of a debt, it tracked the supposed additional cost of using a rival chip.&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{Cite news |title=AMD Sticks It to Intel—Again |first=Arik |last=Hesseldahl |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2006/tc20060502_146680.htm |newspaper=BusinessWeek |date=May 3, 2006 |accessdate=October 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a "death clock" parodying the debt clock was erected in Times Square, counting how many maternal deaths happen worldwide every 90 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/nyregion/21nyc.html |title=An Alarm on Maternal Deaths, Global and Local |last=Haberman |first=Clyde |date=September 20, 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two displays related to the national debt were shown during the [[2012 Republican National Convention]]. One of the displays showed a ticking number similar to the original clock. The second display showed a number estimating the amount the national debt had increased since the start of the convention.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/as-convention-opens-debt-clock-ticks/ |title=As Convention Opens, Debt Clock Ticks |last=Southall |first=Ashley |date=August 27, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], the purpose of the RNC's clock was to underscore the fact that national debt had grown at a fast pace under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|presidency]] of [[Barack Obama]], who was then [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|running for reelection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/republican-convention-to-highlight-debt-clock/article/650922 |title=Republican Convention to Highlight Debt Clock |date=August 27, 2012 |newspaper=Weekly Standard|access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNC chair [[Reince Priebus]] stated that the clock represented the "unprecedented fiscal recklessness of the Obama administration."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
The clock is featured in the 2006 documentary ''[[Maxed Out]]'', which is about national debt''.'' Several members of the Durst family appear in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/maxed-out-a-high-interest-look-at-our-collective-debts/ |title="Maxed Out" - A high-interest look at our collective debts |last= |first= |date=March 9, 2007 |work= |newspaper=The Seattle Times |language=en-US|access-date=February 2, 2017 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''oxymoron''' (usual plural '''oxymorons''',  more rarely '''oxymora''') is a [[rhetorical device]] that uses an ostensible [[self-contradiction]] to illustrate a rhetorical point or to reveal a [[paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Charlton T.|last2=Short|first2=Charles|title=A Latin Dictionary|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=oxymorus|publisher=Clarendon Press|accessdate=27 October 2015|location=Oxford|date=1879|quote=''acutely silly'': oxymora verba, ''expressions which at first sight appear absurd, but which contain a concealed point''; so especially of such apparently contradictory assertions as: cum tacent clamant, etc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jebb|first1=Sir Richard C.|title=Sophocles: The Plays and Fragments, with critical notes, commentary, and translation in English prose. Part III: The Antigone|date=1900|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=567|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0023:text=comm:commline=74&amp;highlight=o%29cu%2Fmwron|chapter=Sophocles, ''Oedipus at Colonus''|quote=The phrase is an '' 'ὀξύμωρον' '' (a paradox with a point).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A more general meaning of "contradiction in terms" (not necessarily for rhetoric effect) is recorded by the ''[[OED]]'' for 1902.&lt;ref&gt;"A figure of speech in which a pair of opposed or markedly contradictory terms are placed in conjunction for emphasis" ''[[OED]]''&lt;/ref&gt;.

The term is first recorded as latinized Greek ''{{lang|la|oxymōrum}}'', in [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] (c. AD 400);&lt;ref&gt;Honoratus on ''[[Aeneid]]'' 7.295, ''num capti potuere capi'' (in the voice of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]) "Could captured slaves not be enslaved again?" (William 1910): ''capti potuere capi, cum felle dictum est: nam si hoc removeas, erit oxymorum.'' "the captured can be captured: said with bitterness, for if you were to remove that, it would be ''oxymorum''." see H. Klingenberg in Birkmann et al. (ed.), ''FS Werner'',  de Gruyter (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=F5UDDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143 p. 143].&lt;/ref&gt; it is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὀξύς}} ''{{transl|grc|oksús}}'' "sharp, keen, pointed"&lt;ref name=LSJ1&gt;{{LSJ|o)cu/s2|ὀξύς|longref}}. Retrieved 2013-02-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|μωρός}} {{transl|grc|''mōros''}} "dull, stupid, foolish";&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|mwro/s|μωρός|shortref}}. Retrieved 2013-02-26.&lt;/ref&gt; as it were, "sharp-dull", "keenly stupid", or "pointedly foolish".&lt;ref name=LSJ2&gt;{{LSJ|o)cu/mwros|ὀξύμωρος|shortref}}. Retrieved 2013-02-26. "Pointedly foolish: a witty saying, the more pointed from being paradoxical or seemingly absurd."&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''oxymoron'' is [[Autological word|autological]], i.e. it is itself an example of an oxymoron. The Greek compound word {{lang|grc|ὀξύμωρον}} ''{{transl|grc|oksýmōron}}'', which would correspond to the Latin formation, does not seem to appear in any known Ancient Greek works prior to the formation of the Latin term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/135679?rskey=7ZL0rI&amp;result=3&amp;isAdvanced=false# |title=oxymoron &amp;#124;accessdate 26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and examples==
Oxymorons in the narrow sense are a rhetorical device used deliberately by the speaker, and intended to be understood as such by the listener.
In a more extended sense, the term "oxymoron" has also been applied to inadvertent or incidental contradictions, as in the case of "[[dead metaphor]]s" ("barely clothed" or "terribly good"). Lederer (1990), in the spirit of "recreational linguistics", goes as far as to construct "logological oxymorons" such as reading the word ''nook'' as composed of "no" and "ok" or the surname ''Noyes'' as composed of "no" plus "yes", or far-fetched punning such as "divorce court", "U.S. Army Intelligence" or "press release".&lt;ref name=Lederer&gt;[[Richard Lederer]], "Oxymoronology" in  ''[[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics]]'' (1990), online version: [http://www.fun-with-words.com/oxym_oxymoronology.html fun-with-words.com].&lt;/ref&gt;
There are a number of single-word oxymorons built from "dependent morphemes"&lt;ref name=Lederer/&gt; (i.e. no longer a productive [[English compound|compound]] in English, but loaned as a compound from a different language),  as with ''[[wikt:preposterous|pre-posterous]]'' (lit. "with the hinder part before", compare ''[[husteron proteron]]'', "[[:wikt: upside-down|upside-down]]", "[[:wikt:head over heels|head over heels]]", [[wikt:ass-backwards|ass-backwards]]" etc.)&lt;ref&gt;"closely related to hysteron proteron, it shouldn't be ''ass backward'', which is the proper arrangement of one's anatomy, to describe things all turned around. For that state of disarray the expression should be ''ass frontward''."
[[Richard Lederer]], ''Amazing Words'' (2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnxQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT107 p. 107].&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[sophomore|sopho-more]]'' (an artificial Greek compound, lit. "wise-foolish").

The most common form of oxymoron involves an [[adjective]]–[[noun]] combination of two words, but they can also be devised in the [[semantics|meaning]] of sentences or phrases.
One classic example of the use of oxymorons in English literature can be found in this example from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', where [[Romeo]] strings together thirteen in a row:
{{poemquote|1=O brawling love! O loving hate!
  O anything of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness, serious vanity!
  Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
  Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shakespeare|first1=William|authorlink1=William Shakespeare|title=[[Romeo and Juliet]]|chapter=Act 1, Scene 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shakespeare heaps up many more oxymorons in ''Romeo and Juliet'' in particular ("Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical! Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb! Despised substance of divinest show!" etc.) and uses them in other plays, e.g. "I must be cruel only to be kind" (''Hamlet''), "fearful bravery" (''Julius Caesar''), "good mischief" (''The Tempest''), and in his sonnets, e.g. "tender churl", "gentle thief".&lt;!-- taken from hubpages.com/literature/shakespeare-oxymorons  -- cannot be bothered to reference this properly because it is too easy to google--&gt;
Other examples from English-language literature include:
"hateful good" ([[Chaucer]], translating ''odibile bonum'')&lt;ref&gt;"Poverte is hate[fu]l good", glossed  ''Secundus philosophus: paupertas odibile bonum''; the saying is recorded by [[Vincent of Beauvais]] as attributed to [[Secundus the Silent]] (also referenced in [[Piers Plowman]]). 
[[Walter William Skeat]] (ed.), ''Notes on the Canterbury Tales'' (''Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer'' vol. 5, 1894), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3efWXPDaIiUC&amp;pg=PA321 p. 321].&lt;/ref&gt;
"proud humility" ([[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epithalamion]]'' (1595), of feminine virtue, echoed by Milton as "modest pride". Joshua Scodel, ''Excess and the Mean in Early Modern English Literature'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5UsxJfvHN3oC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;lpg=PA267 p. 267].&lt;/ref&gt;
"darkness visible" ([[John Milton|Milton]]), 
"beggarly riches" ([[John Donne]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions]]'', (1624)&lt;/ref&gt;
"[[wikt:damn with faint praise|damn with faint praise]]" ([[Alexander Pope|Pope]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot]]'' (1734)&lt;/ref&gt;
"expressive silence" ([[James Thomson (poet, born 1700)|Thomson]], echoing [[Cicero]]'s {{lang-la|cum tacent clamant|lit=when they are silent, they cry out}}), 
"melancholy merriment" ([[Byron]]),
"faith unfaithful", "falsely true" ([[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Idylls of the King]]'': "And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true."&lt;/ref&gt;
"conventionally unconventional", "tortuous spontaneity" ([[Henry James]])&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Lesson of the Master]]'' (1888)&lt;/ref&gt; 
"delighted sorrow", "loyal treachery",  "scalding coolness" ([[Hemingway]]).&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Hily-Mane
, ''Le style de Ernest Hemingway: la plume et le masque'' (1983), [https://books.google.com/books?id=N-1MbsaoWvwC&amp;pg=PA169 p. 169].&lt;/ref&gt;

In literary contexts, the author does not usually signal the use of an oxymoron, but in rhetorical usage, it has become common practice to advertise the use of an oxymoron explicitly to clarify the argument, as in:
:"Voltaire [...] we might call, by an oxymoron which has plenty of truth in it, an 'Epicurean pessimist.'" (''[[Quarterly Review]]'' vol. 170 (1890), p. 289)
In this example, "Epicurean pessimist" would be recognized as an oxymoron in any case, as the core tenet of [[Epicureanism]] is [[Ataraxia|equanimity]] (which would preclude any sort of [[pessimism|pessimist outlook]]). However, the explicit advertisement of the use of oxymorons opened up a sliding scale of less than obvious construction, ending in the "[[#opinion oxymoron|opinion oxymoron]]s" such as "[[business ethics]]".

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] interpreted his own surname as derived from the [[Low German]] equivalent of ''dull-keen'' (High German ''{{lang|de|[[wikt:tollkühn|toll-kühn]]}}'') which would be a literal equivalent of Greek ''oxy-moron''.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Adam Roberts, ^''The Riddles of The Hobbit'' (2013), p. 164f;  J.R. Holmes in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (2007),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=B0loOBA3ejIC&amp;pg=PA53 p. 53]. It has been suggested that the actual etymology of the Tolkien surname is more likely from the village of Tolkynen in [[Kętrzyn|Rastenburg]], [[East Prussia]]. M. Mechow, ''Deutsche Familiennamen preussischer Herkunft'' (1994), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Comical oxymoron"==
{{anchor|comical oxymoron}}{{anchor|opinion oxymoron}}
"Comical oxymoron" is a term for the claim, for comical effect, that a certain phrase or expression is an oxymoron (called "opinion oxymorons" by Lederer (1990)&lt;ref name=Lederer/&gt;).
The humour derives from implying that an assumption (which might otherwise be expected to be controversial or at least non-evident) is so obvious as to be part of the lexicon. 
An example of such a "comical oxymoron" is "[[educational television]]":   the humour derives entirely from the claim that it is an oxymoron by the implication that "television" is so trivial as to be inherently incompatible with "education".&lt;ref&gt;"Hosted for 33 years by the conservative intellectual William F. Buckley Jr., the show [''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]'' taped its final installment [... in 1999.] The show was spawned in the earnest mid-'60s, before popular culture swallowed up the middlebrow and 'educational TV' became a comical oxymoron." ''Time'' Volume 154, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jSHgAAAAMAAJ Issues 18-27] (1999), p.  126.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 2009 article called "Daredevil", [[Garry Wills]]  accused [[William F. Buckley]] of popularising this trend, based on the success of the latter's claim that "an intelligent liberal is an oxymoron."&lt;ref&gt;According to Wills, Buckley has  "poisoned the general currency" of the word oxymoron by using it as just a "fancier word for 'contradiction'", when he said that "an intelligent liberal is an oxymoron".  Wills argues that use of the term "oxymoron" should remain reserved for the conscious use of contradiction to express something that is "surprisingly true". {{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Wills-watching-7069 |title=Wills watching by Michael McDonald |publisher=The New Criterion |date= |accessdate=2012-03-27}} {{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/07/daredevil/307546/?single_page=true |title="Daredevil" - Garry Wills|publisher= ''[[The Atlantic]]'' |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2012-03-27}}  However, the usage of "oxymoron" for "contradiction" is recorded by the [[OED]] from the year 1902 onward.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples popularized by comedian [[George Carlin]] in 1975 include "military intelligence" (a play on the lexical meanings of the term "intelligence", implying that "military" inherently excludes the presence of "intelligence") and "[[business ethics]]" (similarly implying that the mutual exclusion of the two terms is evident or commonly understood rather than the partisan [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] position).&lt;ref&gt;"Saturday Night Live transcripts." Season 1, Episode 1. 11 October 1975. http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75acarlin2.phtml.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly,  the term "civil war" is sometimes jokingly referred to as an "oxymoron" (punning on the lexical meanings of the word "civil").&lt;ref&gt;discussed by L. Coltheart in Moira Gatens, Alison Mackinnon (eds.), ''Gender and Institutions: Welfare, Work and Citizenship'' (1998), p. 131, but already alluded to in 1939 by John Dover Wilson in his edition of William Shakespeare's ''King Richard II'' (p. 193), in reference to the line  ''The King of Heaven forbid our lord the king / Should so with civil and uncivil arms Be rushed upon!'' :"A quibbling oxymoron: 'civil' refers to civil war; 'uncivil' = barbarous".&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include "healthful Mexican food" (1989),&lt;ref&gt;referenced in the negative: "'Healthful' and 'Mexican food' need not be an oxymoron" (''Texas Monthly'', 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; "affordable caviar" (1993),&lt;ref&gt;"This opened up an oxymoron too dreadful to contemplate: affordable caviar" (''The Guardian'', 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Microsoft Works]]" (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Marie Meier, ''A Treasury of Email Humor'', Volume 1
(2000), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antonym pairs ==
{{see|Antonym}}
Listing of antonyms, such as "[[good and evil]]", "[[Sex|male and female]]", "[[Size|great and small]]", etc., does  not create oxymorons, as it is not implied that any given object has the two opposing properties simultaneously.
In some languages, it is not necessary to place a conjunction like ''and'' between the two antonyms; such compounds (not necessarily of antonyms) are known as [[dvandva]]s (a term taken from [[Sanskrit grammar]]). 
For example, in Chinese, compounds like  男女 (man and woman, male and female, gender), 阴阳 ([[yin and yang]]), 善恶 (good and evil, morality)  are used to indicate couples, ranges, or the trait that these are extremes of.
The Italian ''[[pianoforte]]'' or ''[[fortepiano]]'' is an example from a Western language; the term is short for ''gravicembalo col piano e forte'', as it were "harpiscord with a range of different volumes", implying that it is possible to play both soft and loud (as well as intermediate) notes, not that the sound produced is somehow simultaneously "soft and loud".

'''Palingenetic ultranationalism''' is a theory concerning generic [[fascism]] formulated by British political theorist [[Roger Griffin]].&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"&gt;{{cite book| author = Griffin, Roger | title = [[The Nature of Fascism]] | publisher = Pinters Publisher Limited | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-312-07132-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"&gt;{{cite paper| last = Griffin | first = Roger | authorlink = Roger Griffin | title =  Staging The Nation's Rebirth: The Politics and Aesthetics of Performance in the Context of Fascist Studies | year = 1994 | url = http://www.libraryofsocialscience.com/ideologies/docs/staging-the-nations-rebirth/index.html | accessdate = 2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key element of this theory is the belief that fascism can be defined by its core [[mythology|myth]], namely that of revolution in order to achieve a "national rebirth" — [[palingenesis]].&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; Griffin argues that the unique synthesis of palingenesis and [[ultra-nationalism|ultranationalism]] differentiates fascism from [[para-fascism]] and other [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[nationalism|nationalist]] ideologies.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; This is what he calls the "fascist minimum" without which there is no fascism.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; 

The idea was first put forth in the 1991 book ''[[The Nature of Fascism]]'',&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt; and has been expanded in a paper titled ''Staging The Nation's Rebirth: The Politics and Aesthetics of Performance in the Context of Fascist Studies'' in the 1994 volume ''Fascism and Theatre: The Politics and Aesthetics in the Era of Fascism''.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt;

[[Roger Griffin]] argues that fascism uses the "[[palingenesis|palingenetic]] [[mythology|myth]]" to attract large masses of voters who have lost their faith in traditional politics, by promising them a brighter future under fascist rule.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; This promise is not made exclusively by fascists: other political ideologies also incorporate some palingenetic aspects in their party programs, since politicians almost always promise to improve the situation.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; More [[political radicalism|radical]] movements often want to overthrow the old order, which has become [[decadence|decadent]] and alien to the [[commoner|common man]].&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; This powerful and energetic demolition of the old ways may require some form of [[revolution]] or battle, but this is represented as glorious and necessary.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; Such movements thus compare the (recent) past with the future, which is presented as a rebirth of society after a period of decay and misery.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; The palingenetic myth can also possibly stand for a return to a [[Golden Age|golden age]] in the country’s history, so that the past can be a guidebook to a better tomorrow, with an associated regime that superficially resembles a [[reactionary]] one.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; Fascism distinguishes itself by being the only ideology that focuses strongly on the revolution in its myth, or as Griffin puts it:

{{quotation|the mythical horizons of the fascist mentality do not extend beyond this first stage. It promises to replace [[gerontocracy]], mediocrity and national weakness with youth, heroism and national greatness, to banish anarchy and decadence and bring order and health, to inaugurate an exciting new world in place of the played-out one that existed before, to put government in the hands of outstanding personalities instead of non-entities.}}
 
Through all this there will be one great leader who battles the representatives of the old system with [[grassroots]] support.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; They appear as one [[mass movement|mass of people]] who have only one goal: to create their new future.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; They have infinite faith in their mythical [[hero]] as he stands for everything they believe in.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt; With him, the country will rise like a [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] from the ashes of corruption and decadence.&lt;ref name="Griffin 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin 1994"/&gt;

==Contemporary examples==

[[National-anarchism]] has been argued to be a [[syncretic politics|syncretic political ideology]] that was developed in the 1990s by former [[Third Position]]ists to promote a "[[stateless society|stateless]] palingenetic ultranationalism".&lt;ref name="Sunshine 2008"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Sunshine, Spencer | title = Rebranding Fascism: National-Anarchists | date = Winter 2008 | url = http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v23n4/rebranding_fascism.html | accessdate = 2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Plantation Act 1740''' ([[Plantation (settlement or colony)|referring to colonies]]) or the '''Naturalization Act 1740'''&lt;ref&gt;The act received Royal Assent in 1740. However, it was formally dated as 1739 in older official uses because acts passed before the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]] came into force, acts were dated by the year in which the relevant parliamentary session began, which, in this case, was 1739.&lt;/ref&gt; are common names&lt;ref name="LB-US I&amp;N"&gt;Michael Lemay, Elliott Robert Barkan, [https://www.questia.com/read/6846180/u-s-immigration-and-naturalization-laws-and-issues U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Laws and Issues: A Documentary History], pp 6-9.

The act became effective 1 June 1740 and allowed any Protestant [[Alien (law)|alien]] residing in any of their [[British America|American colonies]] for seven years, without being absent from that colony for more than two months, would be deemed to be one of "his Majesty’s natural-born subjects of [[Great Britain|this Kingdom]]." The act also required making specific declarations concerning royal allegiance and succession, profession of the Christian faith, and the payment of two shillings.  Compared to other alternatives available at the time, the act provided a cheap and easy method of imperial naturalization, and the length of residency was not unreasonable.&lt;ref name="Par-NL&amp;Hist"&gt;Clive Parry, [http://www.uniset.ca/naty/parry.htm British Nationality Law and the History of Naturalisation], Milano, Giuffrè (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Reflecting the situation in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;See: [[English Civil War]], [[Glorious Revolution]], [[Restoration (England)]] and [[Nonconformist]]s&lt;/ref&gt; the necessary profession of [[Christian]] faith was distinctly [[Protestant]] and specifically [[Church of England|Anglican]]. The act was not intended for conscientious [[Roman Catholics]], and they were referred to in the law as [[Papists]]. Exceptions however for non-conforming religious scruples and conscience were made, in the case of [[Quakers]] and [[Jews]]. Adherents of both faiths were allowed to dispense with the Sacramental test, with the former being [[Quakers Act 1695|allowed to affirm]] the oaths, and the latter being relieved of the obligation to repeat the words 'Upon the true faith of a Christian', at the end of the Oath of Abjuration required by the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] since 1701.&lt;ref name="Henriq-PREJ"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henriques |first=H. S. Q. |date=Jan 1907 |title=The Political Rights of English Jew |jstor=1451130 |journal=[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]] |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=298–341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see, [[Abjuration#English Commonwealth|Oath of Abjuration]], [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)#Historical oaths|Oath of Allegiance]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The Plantation Act was enacted to systematize naturalization procedures in all localities as well as to encourage immigration to the American colonies.&lt;ref name="LB-US I&amp;N"/&gt;  The act provided a workable naturalization procedure by empowering colonial courts to administer the oath of allegiance to aliens.&lt;ref name="Kettner Rev2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Adams |first=Willi Paul |date=Autumn 1979 |title=Review of ''The Development of American Citizenship, 1608-1870 by James H. Kettner |jstor=1599419 |journal=The University of Chicago Law Review |publisher=The University of Chicago Law Review |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=176–184 |doi=10.2307/1599419}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The secretaries of Colonies were required, under penalty, to send annual lists of such persons to the [[Board of Trade|Commissioners of Trade and Plantations]]. The act endowed colonial courts with the responsibility of deciding when alien petitioners had fulfilled the statutory requirements for imperial citizenship.  In proprietary colonies, the judges were appointed by colonial governors and thus represented the royal or proprietary interest.   However, by delegating authority to colonial officials, Parliament subjected naturalization to the pressure of the same local interest groups that increasingly defied the governor's efforts to implement royal and proprietary instructions on other issues.&lt;ref name="BasAsylum"&gt;Marilyn C. Baseler, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5gJ3tOl20eYC&amp;pg=PA63&amp; "Asylum for Mankind": America, 1607-1800], p.63-69, 124-127. Cornell University Press (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the penalties imposed under the act, only six Secretaries of the thirteen American Colonies and one in the West Indies submitted the mandated lists.&lt;ref name="Par-NL&amp;Hist"/&gt;

==Development==
In England during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, several basic statutes applied to naturalization,&lt;ref name="Par-NL&amp;Hist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, Naturalization p. 257-258 ''ff'' "The following are the basic statutes on naturalization which applied in England during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: 7 Jas. I, c. 2, [1609, [[Naturalization and restoration of blood]]]; 15 Carl. II, c. 15, [[Linen Cloth Act 1663]]; 6 Anne, c. 37, [[Duties on East India Goods Act 1707]];  7 Anne, c. 5, [[Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act 1708]];  13 Geo. II, c. 3, [[Supply of Seamen Act 1739]];  22 Geo. II, c. 45, [[Whale Fishery Act 1748]];  26 Geo. II, c. 26, [[Jewish Naturalization Act 1753]]."&lt;/ref&gt; but these statutes would not include many aliens in the colonies who were considered an integral part of the colonial communities.  Over the same time period, the American provinces (except [[New Hampshire]]) passed their own naturalization laws, which granted citizenship to people living within their province. These laws were based more on local colonial interpretations of community citizenship than on stricter considerations in the mother-country. but they gave no rights beyond their borders. This situation was initially accepted as positive and workable in England, but proved to be too inconsistent with and  broader imperial intentions as time passed.

Britain began withdrawing support to promote immigration to the colonies at the end of the [[Seven Years' War]].  Colonial implementation both before and after the Plantation Act tended to ignore, evade, and reshape English regulations, thus vitiating many policy decisions and generating a chaotic array of citizenship procedures.&lt;ref name="BasAsylum"/&gt;  The [[Navigation Acts]] were a particular target for evasion, since they were seen as acting more as restraint on both colonial naturalization and its peoples' ability to take part fully in the economy.&lt;ref name="BasAsylum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoyt-NatinAC"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoyt |first=Edward A. |date=June 1952 |title=Naturalization Under the American Colonies: Signs of a New Community |jstor=2145724 |journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] |publisher=[[Academy of Political Science]] |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=248–266 | doi = 10.2307/2145724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonial naturalization of aliens was outright forbidden in December 1773,&lt;ref name="Hoyt-NatinAC"/&gt; under any conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Baeler, Asylum, p. 125 "Each royal governor was instructed "that you do not upon any pretense whatsoever give your assent to any Bill or Bills that may have been or shall hereafter be passed by the Council and Assembly of the Province under your Government for the naturalization of Aliens...nor for establishing a Title in any Person to Lands, Tennements &amp; real estates in your said Province originally granted to, or purchased by Aliens antecedent to Naturalization."&lt;/ref&gt;   A ban on royal land grants, initiated earlier in 1773, was made final in February 1774.&lt;ref name="BasAsylum"/&gt;

The colonial naturalization laws and the Plantation Act, during its nearly 30-year utilization would define British North America as a refuge and land of opportunity,&lt;ref name="BasAsylum"/&gt;   The prohibition on naturalizing foreigners under the act was considered intolerable, and would be included, ''inter alia'', in the grievances listed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]],&lt;ref name="BasAsylum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoyt-NatinAC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kettner Rev1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood |first=Gordon S. |date=Jan 1980 |title=Review of ''The Development of American Citizenship, 1608-1870 by James H.

[[File:Bnei Hazir tomb PA180072.JPG|thumb|Detail of the [[Tomb of Benei Hezir]]]]

Hundreds of [[rock-cut tombs]] were constructed in [[Israel]] in ancient times. They were cut into the rock, sometimes with elaborate facades and multiple burial chambers. Some are free-standing, but most are caves. Each tomb typically belonged to a single, wealthy family. Bodies were laid out on stone benches. After a generation, the bones were moved to a bone chamber or, later, into [[ossuaries]] and the benches used for new burials. Rock tombs were the province of the wealthy; the common people were buried in the ground.

The earliest [[Canaan]]ite cut-rock cave tombs date from 3100–2900 BCE, but the custom had lapsed a millennium before the earliest Israelite tombs, which date to the 9th century BCE in [[Jerusalem]]. There are a great many Jewish tombs dating to the [[Second Temple period]], and others in the late Roman or early Byzantine period.

==Canaanite period==

Early Canaanite I (3100–2900 BCE) period tombs are the earliest rock-cut tombs yet discovered in Israel; several have been found beneath the [[Ophel]] in Jerusalem. The custom had lapsed by the second millennium.&lt;ref name=Rahmani2&gt;"Ancient Jerusalem's Funerary Customs and Tombs: Part Two", L. Y. Rahmani, ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', Vol. 44, No. 4 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 229–235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Hebrew Bible==
A number of rock-cut tombs are mentioned in the Bible. Possibly the first, called "Cave of Machpelah", was purchased by [[Abraham]] for [[Sarah]] from [[Ephron]] the [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] ({{Bibleref2|Gen. 23:20}}). Traditionally, this tomb, which may have been either a rock-cut or a natural cave, is identified with the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in modern [[Hebron]]. According to very old traditions, Abraham, [[Isaac]] and [[Rebekah]], [[Jacob]] and [[Leah]] were also buried there ({{Bibleref2|Gen. 25:9; 49:29–33; 50:12}}). The [[New Testament]] reaffirms this tradition: "Their (Jacob and his family) bodies were brought back to [[Shechem]] and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money" ({{Bibleref2|Acts 7:16}}).

Rock-cut tombs are also mentioned in the [[Book of Judges]] ({{Bibleref2|Judges 8:32}}), the [[Books of Samuel|Second Book of Samuel]] ({{Bibleref2|2 Samuel 2:32}}), and the Second [[Books of Kings]] ({{Bibleref2|2 Kings 9:28, 21:26, 23:16, 23:30}}).

==In the Gospels==
The [[Gospel of Matthew]] mentions the newly rock-cut tomb of [[Joseph of Arimathea]] ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 27:60}}).

==First Temple period==
{{main|Silwan necropolis}}
[[File:Tomb of Pharao's Daughter.JPG|thumb|right|Remnants of the [[Monolith of Silwan]], a First Temple period tomb.]]
[[File:Jerusalem Tomb of the Garden.JPG|thumb|The so-called [[Garden Tomb]] (9th–7th century BCE)]]

The [[Silwan necropolis]], the most important ancient cemetery of the First Temple period, is assumed to have been used by the highest-ranking officials residing in [[Jerusalem]], the capital city of the [[Kingdom of Judah]]. Its tombs were cut between the 9th and 7th centuries BCE. It islocated in the [[Kidron Valley]] across from [[City of David|biblical Jerusalem of the kings of Judah]], in the lower part of the ridge where the village of [[Silwan]] now stands.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin70&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3148025/The_Necropolis_from_the_Time_of_the_Kingdom_of_Judah_at_Silwan_Jerusalem] The Necropolis from the Time of the Kingdom of Judah at Silwan, Jerusalem, David Ussishkin, ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', Vol. 33, No. 2 (May 1970), pp. 33–46&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of the tombs and the manner of burial is different "from anything known from contemporary Palestine. Elements such as entrances located high above the surface, gabled ceilings, straight ceilings with a cornice, trough-shaped resting-places with pillows, above-ground tombs, and inscriptions engraved on the facade appear only here."&lt;ref name=Ussishkin70/&gt; The stone benches on which bodies were laid out and the small square entrance doors are similar to those found elsewhere in Judah. Ussishkin believes that the architectural similarity to building styles of the [[Phoenicia]]n cities validates the Biblical description of Phoenician influence on the Israelite kingdoms.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin70/&gt; There are three different types of tombs in the Silwan [[necropolis]], each type concentrated in one specific area. Seven of the tombs feature [[gable]]d ceilings and extremely fine stonework. [[David Ussishkin]] describes them as "among the most beautifully rock-cut tombs known in the Jerusalem area even when compared with tombs of later periods."&lt;ref name=Ussishkin70/&gt; In contrast with the extensive family tombs of later periods, these are for single or double burials, with only one of the seven having room for three bodies. Later destruction has effaced the original doorways.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin70/&gt; A second tomb type described by Ussishkin has flat ceilings and one, two, or three chambers of well-dressed stone carefully squared into spacious rooms. One features a rear chamber of especially "impressive" scale and quality. There are tombs combining characteristics of the two described here above. The third type consists of just three "magnificent" monolith tombs, now located in the northern part of the village. These have been carved out of the cliff to create free-standing buildings above the underground burial chambers. Hebrew inscriptions survive on these three tombs; these are the only ancient inscriptions that survive in Silwan.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin70/&gt;

==Second Temple period==
During the Second Temple period, rock-cut tombs were built outside the walls of the city of Jerusalem in every direction,&lt;ref name=Rahmani3&gt;"Ancient Jerusalem's Funerary Customs and Tombs: Part Three Ancient Jerusalem's Funerary Customs and Tombs: Part Three, L. Y. Rahmani, ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', Vol. 45, No. 1 (Winter 1982), pp. 43–53,&lt;/ref&gt; but predominantly to the north and south of the city.&lt;ref name="Hachlili"&gt;Hachlili, Rachel. [https://books.google.co.il/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=ro&amp;id=8BgLu74SWbAC&amp;q=Qidron#v=onepage&amp;q=Qidron&amp;f=false  Jewish Funerary Customs, Practices and Rites in the Second Temple Period], pages 1-2, 30-36. Boston: Brill, Leiden, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The tombs extend as far as 7&amp;nbsp;km from the city walls, with the more prestigious tombs located close to the city.&lt;ref name=Rahmani3/&gt;

The most elaborate group of tombs was in the [[Kidron Valley]] across from the [[Temple Mount]]. These include the [[Tomb of Benei Hezir]] with the adjacent so-called [[Tomb of Zechariah]] monument (actually not a tomb), and the [[Tomb of Absalom]] along with the [[Cave of Jehoshaphat]] located behind it.&lt;ref name="Hachlili"/&gt; Among the notable tombs are the [[Jason's Tomb]], a large, elaborate, family tomb with multiple chambers and inscriptions in both Hebrew and Greek and the [[Tombs of the Kings (Jerusalem)|Tombs of the Kings]], which is actually the tomb of Queen [[Helena of Adiabene]] and her relatives.&lt;ref name=Rahmani3/&gt; The elaborate [[Tombs of the Sanhedrin]] lie to the north of the city.&lt;ref name=Rahmani3/&gt; They were so called by later generations because the largest of them contains 70 chambers with burial benches, and the [[Sanhedrin]] had seventy members.&lt;ref name=Rahmani3/&gt; Each of the three tombs would actually have contained the burials of a single, multi-generational, wealthy family. They were constructed between the reign of [[Herod the Great|Herod]] and the year 70.&lt;ref name=Rahmani3/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Tomb of Jesus==
According to the Gospels, Jesus was laid out in a rock-cut tomb owned by [[Joseph of Arimathea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/mark/15-46.htm |title=Mark 15:46 |publisher=Bible.cc |date= |accessdate=2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed candidates for the tomb include the rock-cut chamber inside the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], the [[Talpiot Tomb]], and the [[Garden Tomb]].

The statue of [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] stands in the middle of [[Knights' Square (Pisa)|Knights' Square]] of [[Pisa]], just in front of [[Palazzo della Carovana]].

It was commissioned by [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Ferdinando I]] in 1596 to the Franco-Flemish sculptor [[Pietro Francavilla]], who executed it in the elegant [[Mannerism|Late Mannerist]] tradition. The statue celebrates Ferdinando's father as the first Grand Master of the Order of the [[Knights of St. Stephen]] and is a civic symbol of the hegemony of [[Florence]].

The Grand Duke Cosimo is represented in the robes of Grand Master, standing on a high [[pedestal]], in the act of subduing a [[dolphin]], symbol of his domination over the seas. The fountain, in front of the pedestal, was also erected by Francavilla. It has a basin in the form of a shell decorated with two grotesque monsters.

The statue has been damaged in the course of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6587">'''Susan Cummings''' (born July 21, 1962 in [[Monte Carlo]], [[Monaco]]) is an [[United States|American]] heiress, best known for killing her boyfriend in 1997.  She had been charged with [[homicide]], but subsequently convicted of [[voluntary manslaughter]] only. She was released after serving 57 days.&lt;ref name="Scott2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Gini Graham|authorlink=Gini Graham Scott|title=Homicide by the Rich and Famous: A Century of Prominent Killers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Vn_edWffGcC&amp;pg=PA85|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-98346-8|page=85|chapter=A Slap on the wrist: The case of Susan Cummings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killing==

Cummings had been in a relationship with [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[polo]] player Roberto Villegas, who had emigrated to the US in 1991. It was common for Argentine polo players to be recruited onto teams owned by wealthy landowners. The players would also be supplied with horses and accommodation.

Cummings met Villegas in 1995 and by 1996 the relationship had got more intense. He forwent returning to Florida for the polo season to help her on her farm. Cummings was a frugal woman so she never paid Villegas for his work; however, she did pay his rent and costs for the horses he owned that he kept on her farm. Cummings had a lot of control over Villegas due to his not having a real income. By mid 1997, strains on the relationship were starting to show.

On the day of his death, Villegas was to play in a polo tournament representing Argentina. He left his apartment and traveled to Cumming's farm (where he also stored his gear). At 9 in the morning, Cummings shot Villegas four times in the second kitchen of the main house.

She told the [[9-1-1|911 dispatcher]] and police that he had turned [[Domestic violence|abusive]] towards her, threatening her with a knife. Villegas was found with a knife crossing his arm. Cummings had cuts on her arm, which police suspected were self-inflicted. She was arrested on charges of [[homicide]]. She was represented by Blair Howard.&lt;ref name="Scott2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moon2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moon|first=Vicky|title=The Middleburg Mystique: A Peek Inside the Gates of Middleburg, Virginia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdIMBA0Byw0C|year=2001|publisher=Capital Books|isbn=978-1-892123-47-3|pages=117–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard's law firm claims he is one of the best ten lawyers in the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hchlawva.com/blair-d-howard/&lt;/ref&gt;

Cummings was convicted on May 13, 1998, of [[voluntary manslaughter]] in the death of her boyfriend, and was sentenced to 60 days in jail and ordered to pay $2,500; she was released after serving 57 days.&lt;ref name="Scott2005"/&gt;

==Biography==
Cummings and her [[fraternal twin]] sister, Diana, are the only children of billionaire arms dealer [[Samuel Cummings]]. After the family moved to the [[United States]], Samuel Cummings bought his daughters a lavish estate in [[Warrenton, Virginia]], named Ashland Farms. It was here that Cummings shot Villegas on September 7, 1997.

Ms. Cummings sold the {{convert|340|acre|km2|adj=on}} ''Ashland Farm'' estate on the edge of Warrenton in [[Fauquier County, Virginia]] for $4.9 million in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-280984.html|title=Fauquier Heiress Selling Ashland Farm Estate|date=September 7, 2003 |first= Ian|last= Shapira| newspaper=The Washington Post {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her twin sister Diana moved to the {{convert|450|acre|km2|adj=on}} LeBaron Farm in [[Culpeper County, Virginia]]. Their manor house, designed by the firm of Versaci Neumann Partners, won recognition in the 2006 Washingtonian Residential Design awards.

==In film and media==

In 2002, this case was the focus of an episode of [[Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice]]. Entitled "A Scandal in Hunt County," this was the third episode of Season One.

In 2004, [[Lisa Pulitzer]] wrote a book on the case called ''A Woman Scorned''.&lt;ref name="Pulitzer1999"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qngmvQkdPeYC|title=A Woman Scorned: The Shocking Real-Life Case of Billionairess Killer Susan Cummings|last=Pulitzer|first=Lisa|date=15 March 1999|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-96833-5|authorlink=Lisa Pulitzer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Biography Channel]] program about the case included an interview with a young [[Tareq Salahi]], who was a friend of Roberto Villegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=546840&amp;airingid=17194562|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118072244/http://www.biography.com/listings/episode_details.do?episodeid=546840&amp;airingid=17194562|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-18|title=Middleburg: Pistols, Ponies, and Foul Play|publisher=Biography Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap''''' is a 2014 non-fiction book by journalist [[Matt Taibbi]] about [[income inequality in the United States]] and its impact on the American conception of [[justice]] and the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;Noah, Timothy. (April 10, 2014). [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/books/review/the-divide-by-matt-taibbi.html?_r=0 The Justice Gap]. ''The New York Times''. Retrieved April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Published by [[Spiegel &amp; Grau]], the book illustrates the "divide" by looking at the relationship between growing income inequality and the criminalization of poverty, as poor people are increasingly harassed, arrested and imprisoned for minor crimes in the U.S., sometimes for no actual crime at all, {{according to whom?|date=March 2018}} {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}even as [[Crime in the United States|crime rates continue to plummet]], resulting in a prison population that "is now the biggest in the history of human civilization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2014/4/14/read_matt_taibbi_on_the_divide READ: Matt Taibbi on "The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap"]. ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' 14 April 2014. Retrieved 19 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Taibbi writes, [[white-collar criminal]]s who continue to [[Subprime mortgage crisis|defraud the financial system]] avoid punishment, allowing them to accumulate even more wealth without fear of future prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Hendrick. (April 12, 2014).

''The Washington Post''. Retrieved April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Taibbi argues that as a result of this divide, money has now redefined the meaning of justice, distorting the very notion of American citizenship and challenging the founding ideals of its nation.  The ''Los Angeles Times'' called the book "advocacy journalism at its finest, an attempt to stir us up."&lt;ref&gt;Ulin, David L. (March 27, 2014).

'''{{nihongo|Tokyo Kodomo Club|東京こどもクラブ|Tōkyō Kodomo Kurabu}}''', meaning '''Tokyo Children Club''', is an [[early childhood education]] program published in Japan in an audio-visual format, distributed monthly on a [[Gramophone record|record]]. The 7-inch record contained stories and songs, accompanied by a [[picture book]] that could be bound in a special folder. The early-childhood education program came in two courses: a 2-4 year old course and a 5-7 year old course. Each of the courses was designed to complete in 12 months. In addition on a quarterly basis, the Club sent out supplemental stories, songs and other music on a 12-inch record. The recitations on Side A were by {{nihongo|"Uncle Maeda"|前田武彦|Takehiko Maeda}}, and on Side B, {{nihongo|"Bin-chan"|楠トシエ|Toshie Kusunoki}}. The records were monaural recordings at 33-1/3 rpm. Presently, the recordings have gone out of print, making their procurement quite difficult.

==Programs==
The programs were designed to familiarize children with stories and songs from around the world, with emphasis on European orchestral works. Main story narration often featured Classical music as a background music in order to help set the tone of the story. The bullets found in the index to each lesson were color-coded: red for the main story, blue for the songs and yellow for the occasional extra story. In the original course series, the main stories and songs were bulleted with a star and the extra stories with a circle. However, in later course series, they switched their bullets to red circles, blue squares and yellow triangles, keeping the same color code as before.

===Sing in English Group===
The Tokyo Kodomo Club issued two courses of children’s songs in English for the Japanese audience in the '''{{nihongo|Sing in English Group|英語で歌う会|Ei-go de Utau Kai}}''' series. These songs were sung by Esther Ghan and her children. The '''{{nihongo|Let’s Sing English Songs|英語で歌いましょう|Ei-go de Utaimashō}}''' course was designed similarly to their Japanese courses, where the lesson units were distributed monthly on a record. Each of the courses was designed to complete in 12 months, with the course set spanning two years. For the older children, '''{{nihongo| Folk-album for All|みんなのフォーク・アルバム|Minna no Fōku-arubamu}}''' in a set of six lesson units and a Christmas supplement were provided. It also spanned over two years.

[[Image:Christian Aid campaigners with Hilary Benn and Andrew Smith 20050127.jpg|thumb|Activists from [[Christian Aid]] lobbying for Trade Justice.]]

'''Trade justice''' is a campaign by [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]], plus efforts by other actors, to change the rules and practices of [[International trade|world trade]] in order to promote fairness. These organizations include consumer groups, trade unions, faith groups, [[aid agency|aid agencies]] and environmental groups.

The organizations campaigning for trade justice posit this concept in opposition to [[free trade]], the advocates of which often also claim pro-poor outcomes.  Trade justice advocates argue that truly free trade does not and will never exist, and that governmental policies on trade should be in the public interest, rather than the interest of wealthy entities who try to influence trade negotiation to benefit their individual interests. Advocates of trade justice argue that growing inequity and serious gaps in [[social justice]], and the global export of [[terrorism]], are symptoms of an economic system that permits harms to be exported to other countries, while importing their goods.  They point to [[extinction]], [[deforestation]], [[social unrest]], as consequences of [[globalisation]], and in particular of an "unfair" globalisation. In the past, the responses sought by critics of the international trade system included various penalties on "unfair" goods. This argument generally made little headway against the long-term movement towards [[free trade]]; imposition of penalties for "[[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]" was sometimes motivated by domestic political reasons such as the United States imposition of [[steel tariffs]] in 2001).

Today, the trade justice movement concentrates more on the abolition of [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] and dumping, and to a much lesser extent on offsetting penalties on "unfair" goods. Indeed, although there are many who are still critical of free trade in general, there is a trend towards campaigning against what is seen as [[hypocrisy]] by [[developed countries]] in using [[protectionism]] against the poorest countries, especially in agricultural products, while requiring them to leave their own producers without protection.

== Trade justice movement ==

The [[Trade Justice Movement]] in the UK was the first formal coalition of groups to use the term "trade justice" (partly because in the UK, "[[fair trade]]" usually refers to [[Fairtrade certification]] and is a consumer model of change rather than an overtly political movement calling for government action). The term trade justice has been widely adopted internationally by campaign groups, for example by the over 100 national platforms of the [[Global Call to Action Against Poverty]] where it is one of the four main demands. In many countries "[[fair trade]]" is used as well as or instead of "trade justice".

The global institutions that are most often targeted in trade justice campaigns against the alleged injustices of the current international trade system are the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB). Campaigners also lobby their own governments with the intention of creating pressure on them to prioritise poverty reduction when making international trade rules. In trading blocs such as the [[European Union]] (EU), the campaigns seek to influence policy across a number of member state governments.

"Trade Justice" and "Fair Trade" were originally used by those supporting [[social justice]] and the alleviation of the intense [[poverty]] found in many developing nations. They contrasted "fair trade" with 'unfair' [[international trade]] practices. It is associated particularly with [[Labor union|labour unions]] and [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]], in their criticism of disparities between the protections for [[Capital (economics)|capital]] versus those for labour and the environment. The use of the term has expanded beyond campaigns to reform current trading practices, and the major institutions such as the [[World Trade Organization]] which embody them. Now it has become a movement to allow consumers to choose ''not'' to participate in these practices. [[Fairtrade labelling]] or "Fairtrade certification" allows [[consumer]]s to identify goods especially commodities such as [[coffee]], that meet certain agreed standards of fairness.

== Issues ==

Academics such as [[Thomas Alured Faunce]] argue that the insertion of a [[constructive ambiguity]] such as valuing [[innovation]] in [[bilateral trade agreements]] (and then according [[normative]] and ongoing [[lobbying]] power to such textual negotiating truces by formally linking them with [[non-violation nullification of benefits]] provisions) may undermine democratic [[sovereignty]] with regard to construction of domestic policy, particularly in areas such as the environment and public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Faunce | first = Thomas Alured | author-link = Thomas Alured Faunce | title = Reference pricing for pharmaceuticals: is the Australia–United States free trade agreement affecting Australia’s pharmaceutical benefits scheme? | journal = Med J Aust | year = 2007 | volume = 187 | pages = 240–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Faunce | first1 = TA | last2 = Neville | first2 = W | last3 = Anton | first3 = Wasson A | contribution = Non Violation Nullification of Benefit Claims: Opportunities and Dilemmas in a Rule-Based WTO Dispute Settlement System | editor-last = Bray | editor-first = M | title = Ten Years of WTO Dispute Settlement: Australian Perspectives | publisher = Office of Trade Negotiations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade | place = Commonwealth of Australia | pages = 123–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is strenuously contested by trade law officials and many domestic policy makers.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

"The mostly widely referred to demand of trade justice campaigners is access to the markets of developed countries or rich countries. When developing countries export to developed country markets, they often face tariff barriers that can be as much as four times higher than those encountered by developed countries. Poverty claims that those barriers cost poor countries $100 billion a year – twice as much as they receive in aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalfootprints.org/trade|title=Trade footprint|last=|first=|date=|website=HEC Global Learning Centre|access-date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most trade justice campaigners focus in some way on the agricultural subsidies of rich countries that make it difficult for farmers in poor countries to compete.  For example, they argue that the European Union's agricultural export subsidies encourage [[overproduction]] of goods such as [[tomato]]es or [[sugar]], which are then sold cheaply or 'dumped' in poor countries. Local farmers cannot sell their goods as cheaply and go out of business.&lt;ref name="Oxfam"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Godfrey|first1=Claire|title=Stop the Dumping! How EU Agricultural Subsidies Are Damaging Livelihoods in the Developing World|url=http://www.iatp.org/files/Stop_the_Dumping_How_EU_Agricultural_Subsidies.htm|publisher=Institute for Agriculture &amp; Trade Policy|accessdate=16 February 2017|date=2002|archive-date=16 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216214819/https://www.iatp.org/files/Stop_the_Dumping_How_EU_Agricultural_Subsidies.htm|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign points to the treatment of agriculture at the WTO, which has institutionalised these injustices. In the few instances where developing countries have used the complex and expensive WTO process to declare subsidies (e.g. US cotton subsidies) excessive, developed countries ignore these rulings, which the WTO itself does not enforce. Recently rich countries have begun to talk about cutting export subsidies, but they often demand greater access to poor country markets in return.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

The term "trade justice" emphasizes that even if the playing field were level, instead of tilted against developing countries, the poorest developing countries in particular would still struggle to gain from trade if forced to trade under [[free trade]] terms.  This is because of their overwhelming lack of competitiveness – poor countries do not have huge stocks of exports waiting to be shipped to rich countries, instead most small farmers want to be able to sell their goods locally.{{Citation needed |date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.schooleconomicscience.org/em_post/justice-and-international-trade/|title=Justice and International Trade - School of Economic Science|work=School of Economic Science|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/nov/27/farming-subsidies-distort-advantages-food-insecurity|title=Why farming subsidies still distort advantages and cause food insecurity|last=Ghosh|first=Jayati|date=2013-11-27|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-20|work=|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''visual arts''' are [[Art#Forms, genres, media, and styles|art forms]] such as [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[printmaking]], [[design]], [[craft]]s, [[photography]], [[video]], [[filmmaking]], and [[architecture]].

Buzzle.com. Retrieved 11 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[industrial design]], [[graphic design]], [[fashion design]], [[interior design]] and [[decorative art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgebrown.ca/centres/AD/index.aspx |title=Centre for Arts and Design in Toronto, Canada |publisher=Georgebrown.ca |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028075227/http://www.georgebrown.ca/centres/AD/index.aspx |archivedate=28 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current usage of the term "visual arts" includes [[fine art]] as well as the applied, decorative arts and [[craft]]s, but this was not always the case. Before the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and elsewhere at the turn of the 20th century, the term 'artist' was often restricted to a person working in the fine arts (such as painting, sculpture, or printmaking) and not the [[handicraft]], craft, or applied art media. The distinction was emphasized by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwar.com/masters/movements/arts_and_crafts_movement.html Art History: Arts and Crafts Movement: (1861–1900). From World Wide Arts Resources] {{Webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091013011648/http://wwar.com/masters/movements/arts_and_crafts_movement.html |date=13 October 2009 }}. Retrieved 24 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art school]]s made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts, maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts.

The increasing tendency to privilege painting, and to a lesser degree sculpture, above other arts has been a feature of [[Western art]] as well as [[Eastern art history|East Asian]] art.  In both regions painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist, and the furthest removed from manual labour – in [[Chinese painting]] the most highly valued styles were those of "scholar-painting", at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs. The Western [[hierarchy of genres]] reflected similar attitudes.

==Education and training==
{{main|Visual arts education}}
Training in the visual arts has generally been through variations of the [[apprentice]] and workshop systems.  In Europe the [[Renaissance]] movement to increase the prestige of the artist led to the [[academy]] system for training artists, and today most of the people who are pursuing a career in arts train in [[art school]]s at tertiary levels.  Visual arts have now become an elective subject in most education systems.

==Drawing==
{{Main|Drawing}}
[[Drawing]] is a means of making an [[image]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface using dry media such as [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. An artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a ''draftsman'' or ''draughtsman''.

Drawing goes back at least 16,000 years to [[Paleolithic]] [[Cave painting|cave representations]] of animals such as those at [[Lascaux]] in France and [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] in Spain. In [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]], ink drawings on [[papyrus]], often depicting people, were used as models for painting or sculpture. Drawings on [[pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]], initially geometric, later developed to the human form with [[black-figure pottery]] during the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dibujosparapintar.com/english_activities/drawing_course_history.html History of Drawing.

With [[history of paper|paper]] becoming common in Europe by the 15th century, drawing was adopted by masters such as [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..dr085000.a |title=Drawing |date=2006 |website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314224108/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..dr085000.a |archive-date=14 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |access-date=23 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Painting]] taken literally is the practice of applying [[pigment]] suspended in a carrier (or [[Paint#Components|medium]]) and a binding agent (a [[adhesive|glue]]) to a surface (support) such as [[paper]], [[canvas]] or a wall. However, when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with [[drawing]], [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], or other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner. Painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas; sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to [[Sistine Chapel|The Sistine Chapel]] to the human body itself.

===Origins and early history===
{{Main|History of painting}}

Like drawing, painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces. The finest examples, believed by some to be 32,000 years old, are in the [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] and [[Lascaux]] caves in southern France. In shades of red, brown, yellow and black, the paintings on the walls and ceilings are of bison, cattle, horses and deer.

Paintings of human figures can be found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. In the great temple of [[Ramses II]], [[Nefertari]], his queen, is depicted being led by [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=1320&amp;HistoryID=ab20&amp;gtrack=pthc History of Painting. From History World]. Retrieved 23 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks contributed to painting but much of their work has been lost. One of the best remaining representations are the Hellenistic [[Fayum mummy portraits]]. Another example is mosaic of the [[Battle of Issus]] at [[Pompeii]], which was probably based on a Greek painting. Greek and Roman art contributed to [[Byzantine art]] in the 4th century BC, which initiated a tradition in icon painting.

===The Renaissance===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance painting}}

Apart from the [[illuminated manuscripts]] produced by monks during the [[Middle Ages]], the next significant contribution to European art was from [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italy's renaissance painters]]. From [[Giotto]] in the 13th century to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Raphael]] at the beginning of the 16th century, this was the richest period in [[Art of Italy|Italian art]] as the ''chiaroscuro'' techniques were used to create the illusion of 3-D space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.evansville.edu/rl29/art340/f04/renaissancepainting.html History of Renaissance Painting.

[[File:The Nightwatch by Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=Rembrandt painting Night Watch two men striding forward with a crowd|Rembrandt: ''[[Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]'']]
Painters in northern Europe too were influenced by the Italian school. [[Jan van Eyck]] from Belgium, [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] from the Netherlands and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] from Germany are among the most successful painters of the times. They used the [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazing technique]] with oils to achieve depth and luminosity.

===Dutch masters===
{{Main|Dutch Golden Age painting}}
The 17th century witnessed the emergence of the great Dutch masters such as the versatile [[Rembrandt]] who was especially remembered for his portraits and Bible scenes, and [[Vermeer]] who specialized in interior scenes of Dutch life.

===Baroque===
{{Main|Baroque}}
The [[Baroque]] started after the Renaissance, from the late 16th century to the late 17th century. Main artists of the Baroque included [[Caravaggio]], who made heavy use of [[tenebrism]]. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] was a [[flemish]] painter who studied in Italy, worked for local churches in [[Antwerp]] and also painted a series for [[Marie de' Medici]]. [[Annibale Carracci]] took influences from the [[Sistine Chapel]] and created the genre of [[illusionistic ceiling painting]]. Much of the development that happened in the Baroque was because of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the resulting [[Counter Reformation]]. Much of what defines the Baroque is dramatic lighting and overall visuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mutsaers |first=Inge |url=https://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Rethinking_the_Baroque_Intro.pdf |title=Ashgate Joins Routledge - Routledge |publisher=Ashgate.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impressionism===
{{Main|Impressionism}}
[[Impressionism]] began in France in the 19th century with a loose association of artists including [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] who brought a new freely brushed style to painting, often choosing to paint realistic scenes of modern life outside rather than in the studio. This was achieved through a new expression of aesthetic features demonstrated by brush strokes and the impression of reality. They achieved intense colour vibration by using pure, unmixed colours and short brush strokes. The movement influenced art as a dynamic, moving through time and adjusting to new found techniques and perception of art. Attention to detail became less of a priority in achieving, whilst exploring a biased view of landscapes and nature to the artists eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impressionist art &amp; paintings, What is Impressionist art?

===Post-impressionism===
{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}
Towards the end of the 19th century, several young painters took impressionism a stage further, using geometric forms and unnatural colour to depict emotions while striving for deeper symbolism. Of particular note are [[Paul Gauguin]], who was strongly influenced by Asian, African and Japanese art, [[Vincent van Gogh]], a Dutchman who moved to France where he drew on the strong sunlight of the south, and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], remembered for his vivid paintings of night life in the Paris district of [[Montmartre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/poim/hd_poim.htm Post-Impressionism. Metropolitan Museum of Art]. Retrieved 25 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism, expressionism and cubism===
{{Main|Modern art}}
[[Edvard Munch]], a Norwegian artist, developed his symbolistic approach at the end of the 19th century, inspired by the French impressionist [[Manet]]. ''[[The Scream]]'' (1893), his most famous work, is widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man. Partly as a result of Munch's influence, the German [[expressionism|expressionist]] movement originated in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century as artists such as [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Ernst Kirschner]] and [[Erich Heckel]] began to distort reality for an emotional effect.
In parallel, the style known as [[cubism]] developed in France as artists focused on the volume and space of sharp structures within a composition. [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] were the leading proponents of the movement. Objects are broken up, analyzed, and re-assembled in an abstracted form. By the 1920s, the style had developed into surrealism with [[Salvador Dalí|Dali]] and [[René Magritte|Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/modern-art-movements.htm Modern Art Movements.

==Printmaking==
[[File:Ancientchineseinstrumentalists.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Ancient Chinese engraving of female instrumentalists|Ancient Chinese engraving of female instrumentalists]]
{{Main|Printmaking}}
[[Printmaking]] is creating, for artistic purposes, an image on a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] that is then transferred to a two-dimensional (flat) surface by means of ink (or another form of pigmentation). Except in the case of a [[monotype]], the same matrix can be used to produce many examples of the print.
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Albrecht Dürer engraving Melancholia I from 1541 seated angel contemplating figure|Albrecht Dürer: ''[[Melancholia I]]'' (1541)]]
Historically, the major techniques (also called media) involved are [[woodcut]], [[line engraving]], [[etching]], [[lithography]], and screenprinting (serigraphy, silkscreening) but there are many others, including modern digital techniques. Normally, the print is printed on [[paper]], but other mediums range from cloth and [[vellum]] to more modern materials. Major printmaking traditions include that of Japan (''[[ukiyo-e]]'').

===European history===
{{Main|Old master print}}
Prints in the Western tradition produced before about 1830 are known as [[old master print]]s. In Europe, from around 1400 AD [[woodcut]], was used for master prints on paper by using printing techniques developed in the Byzantine and Islamic worlds. [[Michael Wolgemut]] improved German woodcut from about 1475, and [[Erhard Reuwich]], a Dutchman, was the first to use cross-hatching.  At the end of the century [[Albrecht Dürer]] brought the Western woodcut to a stage that has never been surpassed, increasing the status of the single-leaf woodcut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/prnt/hd_prnt.htm The Printed Image in the West: History and Techniques. The Metropolitan Museum of Art]. Retrieved 25 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese origin and practice===

{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
In China, the art of printmaking developed some 1,100 years ago as illustrations alongside text cut in woodblocks for printing on paper. Initially images were mainly religious but in the [[Song Dynasty]], artists began to cut landscapes. During the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] (1616–1911) dynasties, the technique was perfected for both religious and artistic engravings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engraving-review.com/chinese-art-engraving.html Engraving in Chinese Art.

===Development In Japan 1603–1867===
[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Hokusai color print "Red Fuji southern wind clear morning" from Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji| [[Hokusai]]: ''Red Fuji southern wind clear morning'' from ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'']]
{{Main|Woodblock printing in Japan}}
Woodblock printing in Japan (Japanese: 木版画, moku hanga) is a technique best known for its use in the ukiyo-e artistic genre; however, it was also used very widely for printing books in the same period. Woodblock printing had been used in China for centuries to print books, long before the advent of movable type, but was only widely adopted in Japan surprisingly late, during the Edo period (1603–1867). Although similar to woodcut in western printmaking in some regards, moku hanga differs greatly in that water-based inks are used (as opposed to western woodcut, which uses oil-based inks), allowing for a wide range of vivid color, glazes and color transparency.

==Photography==
{{Main|Photography}}

[[Photography]] is the process of making pictures by means of the action of light. Light patterns reflected or emitted from objects are recorded onto a sensitive medium or storage chip through a timed [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]]. The process is done through mechanical [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]] or electronically timed exposure of [[photon]]s into [[chemical]] processing or [[digitizing]] devices known as [[camera]]s.

The word comes from the [[Greek words]] φως ''phos'' ("light"), and γραφις ''graphis'' ("stylus", "paintbrush") or γραφη ''graphê'', together meaning "drawing with light" or "representation by means of lines" or "drawing." Traditionally, the product of photography has been called a [[photograph]]. The term ''photo'' is an abbreviation; many people also call them ''pictures.'' In digital photography, the term ''image'' has begun to replace ''photograph.'' (The term ''image'' is traditional in geometric [[optics]].)

==Filmmaking==
{{Main| Filmmaking}}

Filmmaking is the process of making a motion-picture, from an initial conception and research, through scriptwriting, shooting and recording, animation or other special effects, editing, sound and music work and finally distribution to an audience; it refers broadly to the creation of all types of films, embracing documentary, strains of theatre and literature in film, and poetic or experimental practices, and is often used to refer to video-based processes as well

==Computer art==
{{Main|Computer art}}
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:wiki.Picture by Drawing Machine 2.jpg|thumb|Picture produced by Drawing Machine 2]] --&gt;

Visual artists are no longer limited to [[Media (arts)|traditional art media]]. Computers have been used as an ever more common tool in the visual arts since the 1960s. Uses include the [[Image capture|capturing]] or creating of images and forms, the editing of those images and forms (including exploring multiple [[Composition (visual arts)|compositions]]) and the final [[Artistic rendering|rendering]] or [[printing]] (including [[3D printing]]).

'''Computer art''' is any in which [[computer]]s played a role in production or display. Such art can be an image, sound, [[computer animation|animation]], [[video]], [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]], [[video game]], [[website]], [[algorithm]], [[performance]] or gallery installation. Many traditional disciplines are now integrating [[Digital data|digital]] technologies and, as a result, the lines between traditional works of art and [[new media]] works created using computers have been blurred. For instance, an artist may combine traditional [[painting]] with [[algorithmic art]] and other digital techniques. As a result, defining computer art by its end product can be difficult. Nevertheless, this type of art is beginning to appear in art museum exhibits, though it has yet to prove its legitimacy as a form unto itself and this technology is widely seen in contemporary art more as a tool rather than a form as with painting.

Computer usage has blurred the distinctions between [[illustrator]]s, [[photographer]]s, [[Image editing|photo editors]], [[3D modeling|3-D modelers]], and handicraft artists. Sophisticated rendering and editing software has led to multi-skilled image developers. [[Photographer]]s may become [[digital art]]ists. Illustrators may become [[animator]]s. Handicraft may be [[computer-aided]] or use [[computer-generated imagery]] as a template. Computer [[clip art]] usage has also made the clear distinction between visual arts and [[page layout]] less obvious due to the easy access and editing of clip art in the process of [[pagination|paginating]] a document, especially to the unskilled observer.

==Plastic arts==
{{main|Plastic arts}}

'''Plastic arts''' is a term for art forms that involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by moulding or modeling such as sculpture or ceramics. The term has also been applied to ''all the visual (non-literary, non-musical) arts''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.ksu.edu.sa/DOC/Articles19/Article190588.doc Art Terminology at KSU]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plastic%20arts |title=Merriam-Webster Online (entry for "plastic arts") |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materials that can be carved or shaped, such as stone or wood, concrete or steel, have also been included in the narrower definition, since, with appropriate tools, such materials are also capable of modulation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} This use of the term "plastic" in the arts should not be confused with [[Piet Mondrian]]'s use, nor with the movement he termed, in French and English, "[[Neoplasticism]]."

===Sculpture===
{{main|Sculpture}}

Sculpture is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Work of art|artwork]] created by shaping or combining hard or [[plastic]] material, sound, or text and or light, commonly [[Stone sculpture|stone]] (either [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[marble]]), [[clay]], [[metal]], [[glass]], or [[wood]]. Some sculptures are created directly by finding or [[Wikt:carving|carving]]; others are assembled, built together and [[Kiln|fired]], [[Welding|welded]], [[Molding (process)|molded]], or [[Casting|cast]]. Sculptures are often [[paint]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html Gods in Color: Painted Sculpture of Classical Antiquity 22 September 2007 Through 20 January 2008, The Arthur M. Sackler Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104060402/http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html |date=4 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A person who creates sculptures is called a sculptor.

Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the [[plastic arts]]. The majority of [[public art]] is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a [[garden]] setting may be referred to as a [[sculpture garden]].

Sculptors do not always make sculptures by hand. With increasing technology in the 20th century and the popularity of [[conceptual art]] over technical mastery, more sculptors turned to [[Art fabrication|art fabricators]] to produce their artworks. With fabrication, the artist creates a design and pays a fabricator to produce it. This allows sculptors to create larger and more complex sculptures out of material like cement, metal and plastic, that they would not be able to create by hand. Sculptures can also be made with [[3-d printing]] technology.

''Yaahting'' consisted of a number of short pieces lampooning typical examples of nautical journalism: self-congratulatory how-to pieces, "How to Walk Down a Dock," "Restoring the Buzzards Bay 23," and "At Last--A ''Real'' Instant Boat;" fawning interviews of famous yachtsmen, "Hog Wild in Wallenda" and "Tom Blackballer Looks Ahead;" and fatuous cruising tales, "Hearth of Darkness," "Cruising the Persian Gulf," and "A Perfect Cruising World." Other features included reportage on ''faux'' race events ("The Alcatraz 100," "The Flying Squat Nationals," "Going for Broke," and "The ''Inquirer'' Singlehanded TransAt Race") and features on absurd vessels ("Soave 48HRS--The Shape of Things to Come," "Dumpster Ahoy!" and "Hiva-Oa"). A number of the articles were written as specific parodies of the style of popular writers of the era; travel writer Patience Wales was targeted as "Prudence Porpoise," and globetrotters Lin and Larry Pardee became Lint and Berry Nurdee.

Notable in the magazine were the spectacular color photographs, many set up by publisher Meyer and the products of such well-known nautical photographers as Alastair Black, Christian Fevrier, [[Daniel Forster]], [[Benjamin Mendlowitz]], Dan Nerney, and Neil Rabinowitz. Artwork included contributions by Jan Adkins, Don Demers, Robert Forget, and Jeremy Ross. Several famous figures in the sailing world of the 1980s served as photographic models, including [[Tom Blackaller]] and [[Robby Doyle]].

Included are many photographs of disasters and embarrassments, outtakes from the files of maritime photographers featuring dismastings, collisions, and other examples of bad luck and questionable seamanship. Photographers were eager to find a home for these photographs, which were otherwise unpublishable in mainstream periodicals.

''Yaahting'' also featured nearly a hundred pages of parody advertisements and short articles organized by "department."

Roughly 30,000 copies of ''Yaahting'' were produced and were sold directly by Dreadnaught as well as through bookstores and Nauticalia dealers.

Publisher Elizabeth Meyer went on to restore the [[J-Boat]] ''[[Endeavour (Yacht)|Endeavour]]'', and she is now a principal in J Class Management of Newport, Rhode Island, and of the [[International Yacht Restoration School]]. In 1987 Dreadnaught Publishing also produced ''The [[Concordia Yawls]]: The First Fifty Years''.

Editor-in-chief [[Nathaniel Philbrick]] is a writer on maritime and historical subjects. His bestselling ''[[In the Heart of the Sea]]'' won the [[National Book Award]] in 2001. His book ''Mayflower'' (2006) was nominated for a [[Pulitzer Prize]] and was also a bestseller. Executive editor Peter Gow teaches and has written on educational, historical, and maritime subjects, including a meditation on the educative power of being on the water, ''The Watery Realm'' (2006). Advertising coordinator Bob Payne is a well-known travel writer.

''Yaahting'' was an example of the parody genre that flourished in the 1970s and '80s, inspired by other magazine send-ups produced by ''[[The Harvard Lampoon]]'' and others.

{{Nation of Islam|Beliefs}}
'''Yakub''' (sometimes spelled '''Yacub''' or '''Yaqub''') is a figure in the beliefs of the [[Nation of Islam]] (NOI). According to their beliefs, Yakub was a black [[scientist]] who lived "6,600 years ago" and began the creation of the [[whites|white race]]. He is said to have done this through a form of selective breeding referred to as "grafting", while living on the island of [[Patmos]]. Scientific consensus rejects the [[historicity]] of this figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/Perspectives_1/article_7371.shtml|title=Myth or high science? Is there evidence of Mr. Yakub?|work=[[The Final Call]]|last=Muhammed|first=Alan|date=October 24, 2010|accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nation of Islam theology states that Yakub is the [[Bible|biblical]] [[Jacob]]. All branches of Christianity, Judaism and Islam reject this belief or such characerization of Yakub ([[Jacob]]). The story has caused disputes within the NOI during its history. Under its current leader [[Louis Farrakhan]], the NOI continues to assert that the story of Yakub is true, claiming that modern science is consistent with it.

==The story==
The story of Yakub was originated in the writings of [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], the founder of the Nation of Islam, in his doctrinal Q&amp;A pamphlet ''Lost Found Moslem Lesson No. 2''.&lt;ref name = "mos"&gt;Allen, Ernest, "Identity and Destiny: The Formative Views of the Moorish Science Temple and the Nation of Islam" in Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad; John L. Esposito, ''Muslims on the Americanization Path?'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 192 (footnote, p. 213).&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by his successor [[Elijah Muhammad]] in several writings, most fully in a chapter entitled "The Making of Devil" in his book ''[[Message to the Blackman in America]]''.&lt;ref name = "deu"&gt;Deutsch, Nathaniel, "The Proximate Other The Nation of Islam and Judaism", in ''Black Zion: African American Religious Encounters with Judaism'', Oxford University Press, 2000, pp. 104–108&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakub is said to have been born in [[Mecca]] at a time when 30% of original black people were "dissatisfied".&lt;ref name="lisa"/&gt; He was a member of the Meccan branch of the [[Tribe of Shabazz]]. Yakub acquired the nickname "big head", because of his unusually large head and his arrogance. At the age of six, he discovered the law of attraction and repulsion by playing with [[magnet]]s made of [[steel]].&lt;ref name = "mike"&gt;Michael Angelo Gomez, ''Black Crescent: The Experience and Legacy of African Muslims in the Americas'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; This insight led to a plan to create new people. He "saw an unlike human being, made to attract others, who could, with the knowledge of tricks and lies, rule the original black man."&lt;ref name = "mike"/&gt; By the age of 18, he had exhausted all knowledge in the universities of Mecca. He then discovered that the "original black man" contained both a "black germ" and a "brown germ". With 59,999 followers, he went to an "isle in the Aegean Sea called Pelan", which Muhammad identifies with [[Patmos]]. Once there, he established a [[Despotism|despotic]] regime and set about breeding out the black traits, killed all darker babies, and created a brown race after 200 years. Yakub died at the age of 152, but his followers carried on his work. After 600 years of this deliberate eugenics, the white race was created.&lt;ref&gt;Elijah Muhammad, ''Message to the Blackman in America'' (summarized [http://home.att.net/~phosphor/week1a/message.html here]) and ''Yakub: The Father of Mankind''. See also, Dorothy Blake Fardan, ''Yakub and the Origins of White Supremacy'', Lushena Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The brutal conditions of their creation determined the evil nature of the new race: "by lying to the black mother of the baby, this lie was born into the very nature of the white baby; and, murder for the black people was also born in them—or made by nature a liar and murderer".&lt;ref name = "deu"/&gt;

The new race traveled to Mecca where they caused so much trouble they were exiled to "West Asia (Europe), and stripped of everything but the language....Once there, they were roped in, to keep them out of Paradise....The soldiers patrolled the border armed with swords, to prevent the devils from crossing."&lt;ref name = "deu"/&gt; For many centuries they lived a barbaric life, surviving naked in caves and eating raw meat, but eventually they were drawn out of the caves by [[Moses]] who "taught them to wear clothes". Moses tried to civilize them, but eventually gave up and blew up 300 of the most troublesome of them with [[dynamite]].&lt;ref&gt;Elijah Muhammad, ''Message to the Blackman in America'', Elijah Muhammad Books, 1973, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they had learned to use "tricknology" to usurp power and enslave the black population, bringing the first slaves to America.
According to ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'', all the races other than the black race were by-products of Yakub's (spelled Yacub in the biography) work, as the "red, yellow and brown" races were created during the "bleaching" process;&lt;ref name="lisa"&gt;Nelson, Alondra, "A Black Mass as Black Gothic: Myth and Biosacience in Black Cultural Nationalism" in Lisa Gail Collins, Margo Crawford, ''New Thoughts on the Black Arts Movement'', Rutgers University Press, 2006, pp. 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the "black race" included Asian peoples, considered to be shared ancestors of the [[Moors]]. "Whites" were defined as [[Europe]]ans. Elijah Muhammad also asserted that some of the new white race "tried to graft themselves back into the black nation, but they had nothing to go by." As a result, they became gorillas. "A few were lucky enough to make a start, and got as far as what you call the gorilla. In fact, all of the monkey family are from this 2,000 year history of the white race in Europe."&lt;ref name = "deu"/&gt;

According to NOI doctrine, Yakub's progeny were destined to rule for 6,000 years before the original black peoples of the world regained dominance, a process that had begun in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenationofislam.org/yakubabraham.html Abraham/Mr. Yakub, NOI.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi/noframes/read/4525 Raelist Admissiom from ALLAH Messager]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muhammadspeaks.com/Makingofdevil.html|last=Messenger Elijah Muhammad|title=The Making of Devil|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223190459/http://www.muhammadspeaks.com/Makingofdevil.html|archivedate=23 February 2012|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yakub and Jacob==
The name [[Jacob in Islam|Ya`qub (Yakub)]] is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] variant of the name of the [[Biblical Patriarch]] known as [[Jacob]] in [[English language]] versions of the [[Bible]], and as  ''{{lang|he-Latn|Ya`aqob}}'' in [[Biblical Hebrew]]. [[Fard Muhammad]]'s Yakub has some parallels to the Biblical Jacob's role as the father of the [[tribes of Israel]]. The idea that Jews were an "artificial race" created by interbreeding and dependent on "tricks and lies" already existed in [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] theories of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Linda L. Clark, ''Social Darwinism in France'', University of Alabama Press, 1984, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Yakub includes Jews as part of a wider artificially created "white" race.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd, ''The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World, 1600–2000'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NOI's claim that Jacob altered the skin color of a specific group of humans through selective breeding is similar to [[Jacob#Jacob's marriages|a story in Genesis 30:37–43 where Jacob alters the fur color of the goats and sheep in his uncle Laban's flocks]]. This story could be the origin of the NOI's story of Yakub. One major difference is that while the NOI says that Yakub employed selective breeding, Jacob used [[sympathetic magic]] in the Old Testament.

In speeches by Malcolm X, Yakub is identified completely with Jacob. Referring to the story of [[Jacob wrestling with the angel]], Malcolm X states that Elijah Muhammad told him that "Jacob was Yacub, and the angel that Jacob wrestled with wasn't God, it was the government of the day". This was because Yakub was seeking funds for his expedition to Patmos, "so when it says Jacob wrestled with an angel, 'angel' is only used as a symbol to hide the one he was really wrestling with". However, Malcolm X also states that [[John of Patmos]] was also Yakub, and that the [[Book of Revelation]] refers to his deeds: "John was Yacub. John was out there getting ready to make a new race, he said, for the word of the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm X, Benjamin Karim, ''The End of White World Supremacy: Four Speeches by Malcolm X'', Arcade Publishing, 1989, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
[[File:20041229-Olmec Head (Museo Nacional de Antropología).jpg|thumb|One of the [[Olmec colossal heads|Olmec heads]] claimed to demonstrate the existence of a large-headed "Negro race" in America]]
Ernest Allen argues that "the Yakub myth may have been created out of whole cloth by Prophet Fard", but could conceivably have been influenced by a real historical event during the struggle between Muslims and Christians for control of Spain. Muslim leader [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur]] defeated the Franks at the [[Battle of Alarcos]] (1195). After the battle 40,000 European prisoners of war were taken to Morocco to labor on Yaqub's building projects. They were then set free and "allowed to form a valley settlement located somewhere between Fez and Marrakesh. On his deathbed Ya'qub lamented his decision to allow these Shibanis (as they came to be called) to form an enclave on Moroccan soil, thereby posing a potential threat to the stability of the Moorish empire.".&lt;ref name = "mos"/&gt;

Yusuf Nuruddin says that a more direct source was the doctrine of the "Yacobites" propounded by [[Timothy Drew]]'s [[Moorish Science Temple]], to which Fard had probably belonged before he founded the NOI. According to Drew, early pre-Columbian civilizations were founded by a West African Moor "named Yakub who landed on the Yucatan peninsula".&lt;ref name = "nurr"&gt;Nuruddin, Yusuf, "African-American Muslims and the Question of Identity Between Traditional Islam, African Heritage, and the American Way", in Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad; John L. Esposito, ''Muslims on the Americanization Path?'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; This derived from the then-current notion that the gigantic heads created by the ancient [[Olmec]] peoples of the Yucatán area had "negroid" features (see [[Olmec alternative origin speculations]]), which had led [[Leo Wiener]] to argue that they were migrants from West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz de Montellano, Bernard &amp; Gabriel Haslip Viera &amp; Warren Barbour, "They Were NOT Here before Columbus: Afrocentric Hyperdiffusionism in the 1990s". ''Ethnohistory'', Duke University Press, issued by the American Society for Ethnohistory, 44 (2): pp. 199–234&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;They [Drew's followers] said that the huge stone heads attested to the fact that the Yakubites evolved into a race of scientific geniuses with large heads (as depicted in the sculptures) and small bodies. This legend of Yakub—a bigheaded scientist—finds its way into the mythology of the Nation of Islam, indicating that the founders of the NOI, W. D. Farrad and Elijah Muhammad, were influenced by the Moorish Science Temple, and were possibly even members.&lt;ref name = "nurr"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Harold Bloom]] in his book ''The American Religion'' argues that Yakub combines elements of the biblical God and the Gnostic concept of the [[Demiurge]], saying that "Yakub has an irksome memorability as a crude but pungent Gnostic Demiurge".&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold, ''The American Religion The Emergence of the Post Christian Nation'', New York, Simon Schuster, 1992, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Nathaniel Deutsch also notes that Fard and Muhammad draw on the concept of the Demiurge, along with traditions of esotericism in Biblical interpretation, absorbing aspects of Biblical tales to the new narrative, such as the swords of the Muslim warriors keeping the "white devils" from Paradise, like the flaming sword of the angel protecting the [[Garden of Eden]] in Genesis.&lt;ref name = "deu"/&gt; Edward Curtis calls the story "a black theodicy: a story grounded in a mythological view of history that explained the fall of black civilization, the Middle Passage from Africa to the Americas, and the practice of Christian religion among slaves and their descendants."&lt;ref name = "ed"&gt;Edward E. Curtis IV, "Black Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam, 1960–1975", University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 2006, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several commentators state that the story, by associating blacks with ancient high civilizations and whites with cave-dwelling barbarians and gorillas, both uses and spectacularly reverses the populist and scientific racism of the era which identified Africans as primitive, or closer to apes than whites. This drew on earlier criticisms of white supremacist [[Nordicism]], creating a mythic version of "attacks on AngloSaxon lineage and behavior that had been voiced by more mainstream black thinkers during the nineteenth century....With these references the [NOI] Muslims replicated the images of European savagery in the Middle Ages that were so pervasive in nineteenth-century black racial thought."&lt;ref&gt;Bay, Mia, ''The White Image in the Black Mind: African-American Ideas about White People, 1830–1925'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;  Deutsch says that "Muhammad anchored his radical doctrine within the context of an established scriptural tradition" of Biblical exegesis, which "was therefore a sophisticated form of resistance to white racism".&lt;ref name = "deu"/&gt; In addition, "the long-standing Western tradition of identifying blackness and darkness with evil is thus dramatically reversed".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. Mamiya, "Minister Louis Farrakhan and the Final Call: Schism in the Muslim Movement", Earle H. Waugh (ed) ''The Muslim Community in North America'', University of Alberta Press,: Edmonton, 1983, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the Nation of Islam==
The doctrine of Yakub was one of the reasons for splits in the Nation of Islam. Malcolm X in his ''Autobiography'' notes that, in his travels in the [[Middle East]], many Muslims reacted with shock upon hearing about the doctrine of Yakub, which, while present in NOI theology, does not appear in mainstream Islam. {{Page needed|date=September 2010}} He rejected the story in his later statements, asserting that anyone of any race who intentionally deprives others of basic human rights is a "devil".&lt;ref&gt;Dean E. Robinson, ''Black Nationalism in American Politics and Thought'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warith Deen Mohammed]], who took over the Nation of Islam after his father Elijah's death rejected it almost immediately, and tried to re-invent the Nation as a mainstream Sunni Islam movement.

[[Louis Farrakhan]] reinstated the original Nation of Islam, and has reasserted his belief in the literal truth of the story of Yakub. In a 1996 interview, [[Henry Louis Gates]], Chairman of Harvard University's Afro-American Studies Department, asked him whether the story was a metaphor or literal. Farrakhan claimed that aspects of the story had been proven accurate by modern genetic science and insisted that "Personally, I believe that Yakub is not a mythical figure—he is a very real scientist. Not a big-head silly thing, as they would like to say."&lt;ref&gt;Gates, Henry Louis, “Farrakhan Speaks”, ''Transition: An International Review'', Summer 1996, pp. 140–167; Ostow, Mortimer, "Black Myths and Black Madness: Is Black Antisemitism Different?", in Alan Helmreich; Paul Marcus (ed)''Blacks and Jews on the Couch: Psychoanalytic Reflections on Black-Jewish Conflict'', Praeger Publishers, 1998, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Farrakhan's periodical ''[[The Final Call]]'' continues to publish articles arguing that modern science supports the accuracy of Elijah Muhammad's account of Yakub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/Perspectives_1/article_9878.shtml "National Geographic Proves Teaching on Mr. Yakub", ''The Final Call'', May 23, 2013]; [http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/Perspectives_1/article_7371.shtml "Myth or high science? Is there evidence of Mr. Yakub?", ''The Final Call'', Oct 24, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==

===Drama===
The American author and playwright [[Amiri Baraka]]'s play ''[[A Black Mass]]'' (1965) takes inspiration from the story of Yakub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/baraka.htm |title=Amiri Baraka |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504101347/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/baraka.htm |archivedate=4 May 2009 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to critic Melani McAlister, "the character of Yakub, now called Jacoub, is introduced as one of three 'Black Magicians' who together symbolize the black origin of all religions." McAlister argues that, &lt;blockquote&gt;Baraka turns the Nation's myth into a reinterpretation of the Faust story and a simultaneous meditation on the role and function of art. As with Faust, Jacoub's individualism and egotism are his undoing, but his failings also signal the destruction of a community. Baraka's version of the story also draws on the Frankenstein tale; he conflates the six hundred years of Elijah Muhammad's “history” into a single, terrible moment of the creation of a monster.&lt;ref name = "mel"&gt;Melani McAlister, "Encounters: Culture, Media, and U.S. Interests in the Middle East, 1945–2000, University of California Press, Berkeley, CA, 2001, pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In Baraka's version the experiment creates a single Frankenstein-like "white" monster who kills Jacoub and the other magician-scientists and bites a woman, transforming her in a vampire-like way into a white-devil mate for himself. From this monstrous couple the white race is descended.&lt;ref name = "mel"/&gt;

===Rap===
According to Charise L. Cheney, the doctrine of Yakub has had a significant influence in rap culture, referring to raps by [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] and [[Grand Puba]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;This pseudoscientific theory of racial formation was embraced by rap nationalists like former Ice Cube protégé Kam in his 1995 song “Keep tha Peace.” A self-proclaimed member of the Nation, Kam presented organizational doctrine as a way to explain the roots of black-on-black crime and gang violence in America's inner cities: “I'm really not knowin' who to blame or fault / for this tension / I mention this gump / Yakub's cavey / the blue-eyed punk / playin' both sides against each other / now that's the real mutha[fuckah].”... In 1990 Grand Puba of Brand Nubian announced that his calling was to bring enlightenment to black people and an end to white domination. ... "Here comes the god to send the devil right back to his cave.… We're gonna drop the bomb on the Yakub crew.&lt;ref name = "char"&gt;Charise L. Cheney, ''Brothers Gonna Work It out: Sexual Politics in the Golden Age of Rap Nationalism'', New York University Press, 2005, pp. 81, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] also refers to the story in his song "Party for Your Right to Fight", referring to the Yakub story by attributing the deaths of African American radicals to the “grafted devils” conspiring against the “Black Asiatic Man.”.&lt;ref name = "char"/&gt;

[[Method Man]] of the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] promotes the story of Yakub in the [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]'s song "Raw Hide," saying: "A mystery god that's the work of Yacub / The Holy Ghost got you scared to death kid boo!". In the [[Wu-Tang Clan]]'s song "[[Gravel Pit]]", at the end of it, can be heard a vocal sample from a 1977 movie ''[[Short Eyes (film)|Short Eyes]]'' which says about Yakub: "''Yakub, maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now. Your presence here affects the mind of my people like a fever. You, Yakub, are the bearer of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine diseases, evil, corrupt, porkchop-eatin' brain!''".

[[Wu-Tang]] member [[Ghostface Killah]] also references the story of Yakub in his song "One" from his album [[Supreme Clientele]]. He raps: "A-yo, the Devil planted fear inside the black babies." He concludes the verse with: "Dead meat placed on the shelves, we eat cold cuts / Fast from the hog y'all and grow up,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ghostface Killah (Ft. T.M.F.) – One|url=https://genius.com/Ghostface-killah-one-lyrics|language=en|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating the NOI's dietary practice of avoiding pork.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nation of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}

[[Nas]] raps "You devils will run back into the caves you came from" in his song "Message To The Feds, Sincerely, We The People" from his album [[Street's Disciple]].

On a freestyle to [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]'s song "We Made It", [[Jay Electronica]] says "All these devils, I got to strike some" and [[Jay Z]] says "I'm ready to chase the Yakub back into caves".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10390">'''Yannis Stavrakakis''' ({{lang-el|Γιάννης Σταυρακάκης}}; born 1970) is a Greek–British political theorist. A member of the [[Essex School of discourse analysis]], he is mainly known for his explorations of the importance of psychoanalytic theory ([[Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]) for contemporary political and cultural analysis.

== Work ==

His research interests include contemporary political theory (with emphasis on psychoanalytic and post-structuralist approaches), the analysis of ideology and political discourse in societies of late modernity (with emphasis on the study of political ecology, [[populism]] and [[post-democracy]]) and the political dimensions of artistic practices and theater. His recent work has focused on the political and psychosocial implications of what he calls "debt societies" of Southern Europe (especially Greece) and on the emerging ideological cleavage between populist and anti-populist discourses within this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Stavrakakis | first = Yannis | title = my country is the colony of a larger colony | url = http://www.chronosmag.eu/index.php/y-stavrakakis-my-country-is-the-colony-of-a-larger-colony.html | work = CHRONOS }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Stavrakakis | first1 = Yannis | last2 = Sevastakēs | first2 = Nikolas | title = Laïkismos, antilaïkismos kai krise | publisher = Ekdoseis Nephele | location = Athēna | year = 2012 | isbn = 9789605040468 }} [http://www.nnet.gr/downloads/dt-laikismos.pdf Details.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.anti-pop.gr/ | website = anti-pop.gr | publisher = The "Anti-Pop" Portal }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2014-5 period he has served as Principal Investigator of the POPULISMUS research project, co-funded by the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.populismus.gr/ | website = populismus.gr | publisher = POPULISMUS Research Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; The research focus of the project was on the relationship between populist discourse and democracy and it involved a variety of research and dissemination activities as well as the creation of an international Observatory of populist discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://observatory.populismus.gr/ | website = observatory.populismus.gr | publisher = International Observatory of Populist Discourse }}&lt;/ref&gt;
