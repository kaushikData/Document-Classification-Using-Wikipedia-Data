Only 3 people survived, including 2 patients and a nurse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/news/patients-killed-moscow-psychiatric-hospital-fire-421/ |title=Dozens dead in psych ward fire near Moscow, 3 survive |agency=[[RT (TV network)|RT News]] |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |archivedate=April 29, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429042649/http://rt.com/news/patients-killed-moscow-psychiatric-hospital-fire-421/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22304728 |title=Blaze kills 38 at psychiatric hospital near Moscow |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=April 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428143430/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22304728 |deadurl=no |archivedate=April 28, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/25/world/europe/russia-psychiatric-hospital-fire/index.html |title=38 people dead in fire at psychiatric hospital in Russia |author=Clare Sebastian |agency=[[CNN]] |date=April 25, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430080430/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/25/world/europe/russia-psychiatric-hospital-fire/index.html |archivedate=April 30, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 26, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130426/180855099/38-People-Die-in-Clinic-Fire-Near-Moscow--Health-Ministry.html |title=Fire at Psychiatric Clinic Near Moscow Kills 38 |place=Russia |agency=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |archivedate=April 30, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430214805/http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130426/180855099/38-People-Die-in-Clinic-Fire-Near-Moscow--Health-Ministry.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alexei Anishchuk |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/26/us-russia-fire-idUSBRE93P02P20130426 |title=Fire kills dozens in Russian psychiatric hospital |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |archivedate=April 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428202453/https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/26/us-russia-fire-idUSBRE93P02P20130426 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire==
The fire broke out on the 26th April 2013 at 2:30 Moscow Time (22:30 UTC) in a psychiatric hospital near Moscow in a village called Ramenskyon. Ramenskyon is located approximately 70 miles north of Moscow in the Moscow Oblast in European Russia. The fire ignited on the 2nd floor of the 2 story building in a patient's bed. 3 doctors and 1 nurse ran to the bed but were burned alive immediately. The fire raged through the 2nd floor and killed everyone on that floor. 6 minutes later, the 2nd floor collapsed and crushed patients on the ground floor. 4 minutes later, the fire services reached the hospital and spent the next 3 hours extinguishing the blaze. When the fire finally settled in the morning, the fire brigade broke into the building and searched for survivors but only found 3 injured people alive: a nurse on the 1st floor and 2 patients on  the ground floor.

'''A-process''' refers to the one of the emotional internal processes or responses of the [[opponent-process theory]]. The a-process is in large part responsible for the initial, usually fast and immediate [[emotional reaction]] to a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]].

There is a peak response to any emotional stimuli which usually occurs rapidly, usually out of shock, but last only as long as the stimuli is present. In a physiological sense the a-process is where the [[Pupil|pupils]] [[Pupil dilation|dilate]], the [[heart rate]] increases, and the [[adrenaline]] rushes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/751780873|title=Learning and behavior|last=Mazur|first=James E.|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|year=|isbn=9780205246441|edition=7th|location=Boston|pages=|oclc=751780873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B-Process]], however, the other part of opponent-process theory, is after the initial shock, or emotion. A-process and B-process overlap in somewhat of an intermediate area. While a-process is still in effect, b-process starts to rise, ultimately leveling out a-process' initial spike in emotion. A-process ends once the stimulus is terminated, leaves, or ends. Physiological this is where breathing returns to normal, pulse slows back to its normal rate, and heart rate starts to drop.

The B-process can be thought of as the "after-reaction".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Once B-process has ended, the body returns to [[homeostasis]] and emotions rise back to neutral.

'''Anti-abortion feminism''' or '''pro-life feminism''' is the opposition to [[abortion]] by some [[Feminism|feminists]] who believe that the principles which inform their support of women's rights also call them to support the [[right to life]] of [[Prenatal development|prenatal]] humans. Anti-abortion feminists believe abortion hurts women more than it benefits them.

The anti-abortion feminist movement began to take shape in the early to mid-1970s with the founding of [[Feminists for Life]] (FFL) in the United States and Women for Life in Great Britain amid legal changes in those nations which widely permitted abortion.&lt;ref name="Oaks2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oaks |first1=Laury |last2= |first2= |year=2000 |title='Pro-Woman, Pro-Life'? The Emergence of Pro-Life Feminism in Irish Anti-Abortion Discourses and Practices |journal=Irish Journal of Feminist Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=73–90 |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FFL and the [[Susan B. Anthony List]] (SBA List) are the most prominent anti-abortion feminist organizations in the United States. Other feminist pro-life organizations include [[New Wave Feminists]] and Feminists for Nonviolent Choices.

== Views and goals ==

Anti-abortion feminists consider the legal option of abortion to "support anti-motherhood social attitudes and policies and limit respect for women's citizenship".&lt;ref name=NWSA&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oaks |first=Laury |year=Spring 2009 |title=What Are Pro-Life Feminists Doing on Campus? |journal=[[NWSA Journal]] |volume= 21|issue= 1|pages=178–203 |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nwsa_journal/v021/21.1.oaks.pdf|doi=|pmid= |pmc= |issn=1040-0656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-abortion feminists believe that abortion is an action dictated by society and legal abortion "perpetuates an uncaring, male-dominated society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oaks|first=Laury|year=2009|title=What are Pro-Life Feminists doing on Campus?|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/263661|journal=NWSA|volume=21|pages=178–203|via=Gender Studies Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laury Oaks, Associate Professor of Feminist Studies at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], writes that when abortion is legal, anti-abortion feminists believe, "women come to see pregnancy and parenting as obstacles to full participation in education and the workplace,"&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt; and describes anti-abortion feminist activism in Ireland as more "pro-mother" than "pro-woman".&lt;ref name="Oaks2000"/&gt; Oaks has written that while Irish abortion opponents valorize child-bearing and are critical of the notion that women have "a right to an identity beyond motherhood", some, such as [[Breda O'Brien]], founder of Feminists for Life Ireland, also offer feminist-inspired arguments that women's contributions to society are not limited to such functions.&lt;ref name="Oaks2000"/&gt;

Anti-abortion feminist organizations generally do not distinguish between views on abortion as a legal issue, abortion as a moral issue, and abortion as a medical procedure.&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt; Such distinctions are made by many women, for example, women who would not abort their own pregnancies but would prefer that abortion remain legal.&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt;

Anti-abortion feminist organizations seek to personalize abortion by using women who "survived" abortions to attempt to convince others of their argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Between Jesus and the Market: The Emotions that Matter in Right-Wing America|last=Kintz|first=Linda|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=269|quote=|via=Gender Studies Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent American anti-abortion feminist organizations seek to end abortion in the U.S. The SBA List states this as their "ultimate goal",&lt;ref name="SBA List Mission Statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sba-list.org/about-sba-list/our-mission |title=SBA List Mission: Advancing, Mobilizing and Representing Pro-Life Women |year=2008 |publisher=Susan B.

== Relationship to other movements ==

Anti-abortion feminists form a part of the [[anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion movement]] rather than the mainstream [[feminist movement]].&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt; During the [[second wave feminism|second-wave era]] of the late 1960s and 1970s the tenets of the emerging group of anti-abortion feminists were rejected by mainstream feminists who held that for full participation in society, a woman's "moral and legal right to control her fertility" needed to be a fundamental principle.&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt; From their minority position, anti-abortion feminists said that mainstream feminists did not speak for all women.&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt;

Having failed to gain a respected position within mainstream feminism,&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt; anti-abortion feminists aligned themselves with other anti-abortion and [[Right to life#Abortion debate framing|right to life]] groups. This placement, according to Oaks, has eroded a feminist sense of identity separate from other anti-abortion groups, despite pro-woman arguments that are distinct from the fetal rights arguments put forward by other anti-abortion advocates.&lt;ref name=NWSA/&gt;

== Arguments ==
The abortion debate has primarily been centered around the question of whether or not the fetus is a person.&lt;ref&gt;Markowitz, S. (1990). Abortion and Feminism. ''Social Theory and Practice,16''(1), 1-17. {{jstor|23557071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-abortion feminist organizations do distinguish themselves as "pro-woman" organizations as opposed to "fetal rights" organizations. This sets them apart from other anti-abortion groups.&lt;ref name="NWSA" /&gt;

The "pro-woman" argument frames abortion as harmful to women. Anti-abortion feminists argue that women do not truly want to have abortions,&lt;ref name="Alexa J. Trumpy 2014"&gt;Alexa J. Trumpy (2014) Woman vs. Fetus: Frame Transformation and Intramovement Dynamics in the Pro-Life Movement, Sociological Spectrum, 34:2, 163-184, {{doi|10.1080/02732173.2014.878624}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rather are forced into abortions by third parties, partners or medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="Alexa J. Trumpy 2014"/&gt; These unwanted abortions, they say, cause physical and emotional damage to women.&lt;ref&gt;Melody Rose (2011) Pro-Life, Pro-Woman? Frame Extension in the American Antiabortion Movement, Journal of Women, Politics &amp; Policy, 32:1, 1-27, {{doi|10.1080/1554477X.2011.537565}}&lt;/ref&gt; By positing the existence of a "[[post-abortion syndrome]]" mental condition, which is not medically recognized, anti-abortion feminists reframe opposition to abortion in terms of protecting women's public health.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, R. B. (2008). The right's reasons: constitutional conflict and the spread of woman-protective antiabortion argument. ''Duke Law Journal'', ''57''(6), 1641-1692.&lt;/ref&gt; The "pro-woman" argument has been used to sway men and women against-abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Righting Feminism|last=Schreiber|first=Ronnee|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-533181-3|location=New York|pages=99–101|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th-century feminists ==
Feminist anti-abortion groups say they are continuing the tradition of 19th-century women's rights activists such as [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], [[Victoria Woodhull]], [[Elizabeth Blackwell]], and [[Alice Paul]] who considered abortion to be an evil forced upon women by men.&lt;ref name="obeirne"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060203094203/http://www.nationalreview.com/kob/obeirne200601230842.asp Kate O'Beirne, excerpt from 'Women Who Make the World Worse: and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports' National Review January 23, 2006].

Anthony Birthplace Museum |accessdate=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to historians A. Kennedy and K. D. Mary, Alice Paul felt that abortion was the "ultimate exploitation of women"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kennedy, A., &amp; Mary, K. D. (1999). Feminism and abortion. ''History Today, 49''(8), 34-35. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/202814071&lt;/ref&gt; and worried about female babies being aborted.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Kennedy and Mary also say that Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female doctor in the United States,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; became a doctor because of her passionate hatred for abortion.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; By way of criticism, however, sociologists Nicole Beisel and Tamara Kay have written that white [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Anglo-Saxon Protestants]] (WASPs) in the US were worried that continued abortions by their kind would endanger their position at the top of society's hierarchy, especially fearing the influx of [[Irish Catholic|Irish Catholics]], but also concerned about African Americans, and describe Anthony and Stanton as part of this reactionary racial stance.&lt;ref&gt;Beisel, N., &amp; Kay, T. (2004). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3593062 "Abortion, Race, and Gender in Nineteenth-Century America."] ''American Sociological Review,'' ''69''(4), 498-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

In arguing for "voluntary motherhood&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;" (abstinence until children are wanted), Stanton said that the problem of abortion demonstrates the victimization of women by men who pass laws without women's consent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Woodhull and [[Tennessee Celeste Claflin|her sister]] argued that abortion clinics would go out of business if voluntary motherhood was widely practiced.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gordon, L. (1973). Voluntary Motherhood; The Beginnings of Feminist Birth Control Ideas in the United States. ''Feminist Studies,'' ''1''(3/4), 5-22. {{jstor|1566477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Susan B. Anthony abortion dispute|dispute about Anthony's abortion views]] arose in 1989: anti-abortion feminists in the U.S. began using Anthony's words and image to promote their anti-abortion cause. Scholars of 19th-century American feminism, as well as pro-choice activists, countered what they considered a co-opting of Anthony's legacy as America's most dedicated suffragist, saying that the anti-abortion activists are falsely attributing opinions to Anthony, and that it is misleading to apply 19th century arguments to the modern abortion debate.&lt;ref name=Stevens2006&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevens |first=Allison |title=Susan B.

'''Boracay Island Water Company, Inc.''' (BIWC), branded as '''Boracay Water''', is the joint venture company of [[Manila Water|Manila Water Company]] through its subsidiary [[Manila Water|Manila Water Philippine Ventures]] (MWPV) and the [[Philippine Tourism Authority (Philippines)|Philippine Tourism Authority]] (now [[Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority]]) that delivers potable water service, sewerage service, and eventually, drainage management under a 25-year Concession Agreement to cater the approximately 1,000,000 tourist and 30,000 local residents of [[Boracay|Boracay Island]], [[Malay, Aklan|Malay]], [[Aklan]], [[Philippines]].

Boracay Water was incorporated on December 7, 2009, and commenced its operations last January 1, 2010. It services the entire Island of Boracay governed by three [[barangay]]s namely Manoc-Manoc, Balabag, and Yapak, including the commercial districts popularly known as Stations 1, 2 and 3.&lt;ref name="biwc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boracay Island Water Company|url=http://boracayisland.org/all-service-list/boracay-island-water-company/|website=Boracay Foundation Inc.|accessdate=9 July 2016|ref=BIWC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boracay Water was granted the exclusive right to operate, manage, and expand [[Water industry|water]] and used water facilities for a period of 25 years, renewable for another 25 years. The company was also granted the right to operate and maintain the existing [[Drainage|drainage system]] upon its completion. It assumed operations on January 1, 2010 and began rehabilitating the island’s water and used water infrastructure, to contribute to a sustainable environment and to the economic development of the island.

It helps in keeping the island’s pristine beaches with the rehabilitation of the Balabag Sewage Treatment Plant, a facility that has consistently complied with the stringent pollution control parameters of the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources (Philippines)|Department of Environment and Natural Resources]] (DENR) processing 6.5 million liters of used water per day. Used water service coverage is targeted to be raised by 75 percent by 2016.&lt;ref name="biwc_mwc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Manila Water Philippine Ventures {{pipe}} Boracay Island Water Company, Inc.|url=http://www.manilawater.com/Pages/Manila%20Water%20Philippine%20Ventures.aspx|website=Manila Water Company, Inc.|accessdate=9 July 2016|ref=biwc_mwc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Breastfeeding in public''' is the practice of [[breastfeeding]] babies in a [[public place|public]] or semi-public place in open view of the [[general public]]. Social attitudes and legal protection of the practice varies widely. In many countries, both in the [[Global South]] and in a number of Western countries, breastfeeding in public is common and generally not regarded as an issue. In those countries, laws protect the nursing mother. In many parts of the world including Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bf-info/breastfeeding-and-law/legalright|title=Breastfeeding in public - your legal rights|date=Aug 2016|access-date=12 Nov 2018|publisher=Australian Breastfeeding Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;, some parts of the United States, and Europe, along with some countries in Asia, women have an express legal right to nurse in public and in the workplace. A few countries, such as Saudi Arabia, expressly forbid women to expose their breasts in public, even to breastfeed.

Even though the practice may be legal or socially accepted, some mothers may nevertheless be reluctant to expose a breast in public to breastfeed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://internationalbreastfeedingjournal.com/content/3/1/11|doi=10.1186/1746-4358-3-11|title=Got milk?

=== Africa ===
[[File:Kabala_mother.jpg|thumb|A new mother in Kabala, [[Sierra Leone]] in West Africa nurses outdoors. ]]

In many areas of [[Africa]] breastfeeding in public is the norm. Babies are commonly carried on a mother's back in a length of cloth and merely moved to the front for feeding.  The nursing mother may shield the view of the baby nursing, but generally no attempt is made to hide the baby and the mother's breast from view.  When a baby is seen crying in public it is assumed that the woman with the infant is not the child's mother, since it is normally thought that she would feed the infant if she were the mother.&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding in public"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.007b.com/public-breastfeeding-world.php | title=Breastfeeding in public around the world | publisher=007 Breasts | accessdate=15 October 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008045416/http://www.007b.com/public-breastfeeding-world.php | archivedate=8 October 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China ====
Breastfeeding in public in China has traditionally been uncontroversial, and objection had been unheard of until 2010s. The recent few instances of objection are apparently an effect of magnification of the social media.

In Shanghai, breastfeeding in public is considered embarrassing by some, but it is also accepted by many. There have been calls for the establishment of babycare facilities in public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-01/27/content_794272.htm|title=Congress to consider privacy issue|work=chinadaily.com.cn|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307105647/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-01/27/content_794272.htm|archivedate=2009-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2007-01/29/content_795228.htm|title=Breastfeeding in public|work=chinadaily.com.cn|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620071708/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2007-01/29/content_795228.htm|archivedate=2009-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== India ====
India has no legal statute dealing with breastfeeding. Prevalence and social acceptance vary from region to region.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
In rural India it is completely acceptable. Breastfeeding in public is not a norm in higher sections of society, but is quite common in the lower economic sections.

==== Malaysia ====
Discreet breastfeeding in public is accepted in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com.my/baby/breastfeeding/tips-for-breastfeeding-inpublic/|title=BabyCenter mums’ tips for breastfeeding in public|location=Malaysia|work=BabyCenter|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527144646/http://www.babycenter.com.my/baby/breastfeeding/tips-for-breastfeeding-inpublic/|archivedate=2012-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nepalese society, breastfeeding a child is considered a must for the mothers. Mothers who do not or are unable to breastfeed their child are considered to be 'bokshi' - 'witch', and much social stigma is attached to it.

Breastfeeding in public (restaurants, cafes, libraries etc.) is protected under the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]] under the provision of goods, facilities and services section. If the child is under six months old, the mother has additional protection under a 2008 amendment to the act which protects maternity rights. This is superseded by the [[Equality Act 2010]] which clarifies that a business must not discriminate against a woman who is breastfeeding a child of any age in a public place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/85008/business-quickstart.pdf Equality Act 2010: What do I need to know?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001143/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/85008/business-quickstart.pdf |date=2013-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EqualityAct_2010&gt;{{cite web | title=Equality Act 2010 | publisher=Office of Public Sector Information | date=2010-04-08 | url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=3698792 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224171341/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=3698792 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-12-24 | accessdate=2010-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her companion(s) are also protected by this act.

A 2004 [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|UK Department of Health]] survey found that 84% (about five out of six people) find breastfeeding in public acceptable if done discreetly; however, 67% (two out of three) of mothers were worried about general opinion being against public breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="UK-DOH_2004"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Myths stop women giving babies the best start in life | publisher = UK Department of Health | date = 2004-05-10 | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4081944&amp;chk=b8wDo%2B | accessdate = 2007-02-16 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040519035042/http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4081944&amp;chk=b8wDo%2B | archivedate = 2004-05-19 | df =  }}

A number of issues constrain mothers from breastfeeding in public in the United States. In 2011 the [[Surgeon General of the United States|US Surgeon General]] issued a plea to promote breastfeeding and stated in it: "Although focusing on the sexuality of female breasts is common on the mass media, visual images of breastfeeding are rare, and a mother may never have seen a woman breastfeeding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|year=2011|title=The Surgeon General's call to action to support breastfeeding|url=https://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/calls/breastfeeding/calltoactiontosupportbreastfeeding.pdf|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding is not only a human right for the mother but also the child in need of being fed.

U.S. legislation governing breastfeeding varies from state to state and a limited federal law only applies to federal government premises. A [[United States House of Representatives]] appropriations bill (HR 2490) contained an amendment specifically permitting breastfeeding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d106:HZ00295: |title=Breastfeeding Amendment |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504153044/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d106:HZ00295:# |archivedate=2015-05-04 |df= |access-date=2008-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was signed into law on September 29, 1999. It stipulated that no government funds may be used to enforce any prohibition on women breastfeeding their children in federal buildings or on federal property. Further, a federal law also enacted in 1999 specifically provides that "a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a federal building or on federal property, if the woman and her child are otherwise authorized to be present at the location."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=170184&amp;documentId=67358&amp;glinID=67358|title=Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2000|accessdate=13 July 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} section 647.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of incidents of harassment of nursing mothers which gained media attention prompted a number of U.S. states to act. These incidents included viral videos of people harassing breastfeeding mothers in public, protests, and social media campaigns. A particular incident with a [[Target Corporation|Target]] employee harassing a breastfeeding mother helped to launch a new trend with corporations making breastfeeding accepted in their stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bestforbabes.org/target-employees-bully-breastfeeding-mom-despite-corporate-policy/|title=Target Employees Bully Breastfeeding Mom Despite Corporate Policy - Best for Babes|date=2011-12-14|newspaper=Best for Babes|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017104458/http://www.bestforbabes.org/target-employees-bully-breastfeeding-mom-despite-corporate-policy/|archivedate=2016-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 7AA of the ''[[Sex Discrimination Act 1984]]'' specifically prohibits discrimination against a woman on account of her breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sex Discrimination Act 1984]]'', [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sda1984209/s7aa.html s.7AA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322113138/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/sda1984209/s7aa.html |date=2015-03-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition also applies to a public or semi-public place. State and Territory laws differ, but it is generally illegal to discriminate against women breastfeeding in a public place as a protected attribute in five jurisdictions and by proxy from other existing legislation in the other jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="breastfeeding.asn.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bf-info/breastfeeding-and-law/legalright|title=Breastfeeding in public - your legal rights|work=Australian Breastfeeding Association|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101012310/https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bf-info/breastfeeding-and-law/legalright|archivedate=2012-11-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Breastfeeding Association]] was founded in [[Melbourne]], Victoria in 1964 as the Nursing Mothers' Association, and together with many health professionals, encourages and assists mothers to breastfeed their babies, if necessary also in a public place.&lt;ref name="breastfeeding.asn.au"/&gt;

In February 2003, [[Kirstie Marshall]], member of the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]], was ejected from Parliament for breastfeeding her 11-day-old baby on the basis that the baby was "a stranger" not entitled to be in the Chamber. As a result, a special room was set up for use by nursing mothers.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} A 2007 House of Representatives Committee on Health and Ageing report into breastfeeding recommended that Parliament House seek formal accreditation from the Australian Breastfeeding Association as a breastfeeding-friendly workplace. In March 2008 the Presiding Officers agreed to the recommendation and work commenced to provide facilities to assist breastfeeding mothers at Parliament House. Two small rooms were made available, one on each side of Parliament House, for members of parliament and other building occupants to breastfeed or express milk. Certificates of accreditation were provided in a ceremony at the parliament on 17 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0910/10rp09|title=Children in the parliamentary chambers|work=aph.gov.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030049/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0910/10rp09|archivedate=2015-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
Breastfeeding is encouraged and public breastfeeding is common.  In fact, bottle feeding has been so widely discouraged that public ''bottle'' feeding may make a mother feel more uncomfortable than public breastfeeding. Many shopping centers provide "parent's rooms" where mothers may change and feed their infants in comfort.&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding in public"/&gt;

=== South America ===
In most areas of South America breastfeeding is the norm and public breastfeeding is common in buses, parks, malls, etc. It is less common to see public bottle feeding than breastfeeding. While women are seldom seen nursing in upscale restaurants or on the streets of large cities, nursing is encouraged and thought of as normal and a nursing mother's breasts are not viewed as sexual objects.&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding in public"/&gt;

=== Breastfeeding at work in Canada ===

Under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] women are protected against discrimination, but Canada was one of the only countries that did not have paid breastfeeding breaks. Although over 26% of mothers breastfeed, many of them are forced to stop due to work restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heymann|first=Jody|title=Breastfeeding breaks at work pay off; Canada is in the minority of countries that do not guarantee women paid breaks to feed infants at work,|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1439984164|accessdate=11 March 2014|newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen|date=7 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public breastfeeding in the U.S. ===

There have been incidents of owners of premises, or people present, objecting to or forbidding breastfeeding. In some cases the mothers have left. In other cases, where a law guaranteeing the right to breastfeed has been broken, legal action has been taken.&lt;ref name="Barsch_2006"&gt;{{cite news | last= Barsch | first= Sky | title= Woman alleges she was kicked off Burlington flight for breast-feeding | date= June 11, 2006 | publisher= Associated Press | url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,229390,00.html | accessdate= 2007-01-24 | deadurl= no | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070122232519/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C229390%2C00.html | archivedate= January 22, 2007 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some companies have even apologised afterward.&lt;ref name=legoland&gt;{{cite news|title=Legoland Apologizes To Kelly Sabourin, Breastfeeding Mom Told To Move|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/03/legoland-kelly-sabourin_n_1253276.html|accessdate=28 September 2015|date=February 3, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929005048/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/03/legoland-kelly-sabourin_n_1253276.html|archivedate=29 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One woman who was not allowed to breastfeed despite showing the [[Kentucky]] law that allows her the right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/breastfeeding-state-laws.aspx|title=Summary of Enacted Breastfeeding Legislation Kentucky|accessdate=21 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112805/http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/breastfeeding-state-laws.aspx|archivedate=10 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; left but later organized several "nurse-in" protests in front of the restaurant and other public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/181/story/161782.html |title=Applebee's, woman in dispute over breast-feeding |accessdate=2009-12-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101113120/http://www.kentucky.com/181/story/161782.html |archivedate=2008-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she attempted to be discreet, another patron complained to the manager about [[indecent exposure]]. Both a waitress and the manager asked her to cover up. She handed him a copy of the [[Kentucky]] law that permitted public breastfeeding, but he would not relent.

=== Babytalk magazine cover ===
In 2006, the editors of U.S. ''[[Babytalk (magazine)|Babytalk]]'' magazine received many complaints from readers after the cover of the August issue depicted a baby nursing at a bare breast. Even though the model's nipple was not shown, readers—many of them mothers—wrote that the image was "gross". In a follow-up poll, one-quarter of 4,000 readers who responded thought the cover was negative. ''Babytalk'' editor Susan Kane commented, "There's a huge puritanical streak in Americans."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Mother &amp; Baby magazine ===

In June, 2010, a deputy editor for the leading UK parenting magazine ''Mother &amp; Baby'' set off a storm of protest when she described breastfeeding as "creepy." Kathryn Blundell told readers that she bottlefed her child from birth because, "I wanted my body back [and] to give my boobs at least a chance to stay on my chest rather than dangling around my stomach."  She upset readers when she wrote about her breasts, "They're part of my sexuality, too – not just breasts, but fun bags. And when you have that attitude (and I admit I made no attempt to change it), seeing your teeny, tiny, innocent baby latching on where only a lover has been before feels, well, a little creepy." The anti-breastfeeding tone of her article prompted six complaints to the British [[Press Complaints Commission]] and set off considerable online debate. The magazine also received dozens of messages of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rock|first=Lucy|title=Breastfeeding is 'creepy', says parenting magazine|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/27/breastfeeding-is-creepy-outrage|accessdate=25 November 2011|newspaper=The Observer|date=26 June 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113042/http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jun/27/breastfeeding-is-creepy-outrage|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 US television presenter [[Barbara Walters]] remarked on her talk show ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' that she felt uncomfortable sitting next to a breastfeeding mother during a flight.

In December, 2011, Michelle Hickman was breastfeeding her infant at the back of a Target store in Houston, Texas. Although covered, she was asked by two employees to move to a fitting room. Hickman said one of the employees told her, "You can get a ticket and be reported for indecent exposure." She reported the harassment on Facebook, and in response a number of mothers organized public "nurse-ins" at [[Target Corporation|Target]] stores across the United States in cities including Houston, [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], and Decatur, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Breastfeeding Moms Stage 'Nurse-In' Protest at Target Stores Worldwide|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/12/28/breastfeeding-moms-stage-nurse-in-protest-at-target-stores-worldwide/?test=latestnews#ixzz1htuFYsSp|accessdate=10 February 2012|newspaper=FoxNews|date=December 28, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214112857/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/12/28/breastfeeding-moms-stage-nurse-in-protest-at-target-stores-worldwide/?test=latestnews#ixzz1htuFYsSp|archivedate=14 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Trace Gallagher]] on FoxNews reported on the protest, and female host of ''[[America Live]]'' [[Megyn Kelly]] commented, “You know, I got a lot of thoughts on this, Trace.” She explained, “Let me just put it this way: I used to feel a lot differently before I had babies and you’re breastfeeding; they need to be fed and then sometimes they don’t like the cover.

In 2014 a waiter at [[Claridge's]] hotel in [[Mayfair, London]] asked Louise Burns to breastfeed under a cloth. Burns was told that it was hotel policy for mothers to cover up while breastfeeding.

=== Breastfeeding in uniform in the US military ===

In May 2012, two Air Force National Guard service members stationed at [[Fairchild Air Force Base]], Washington, participated in a breastfeeding awareness campaign hosted by the Mom2Mom of Fairchild Breastfeeding Support Group. Photographer Brynja Sigurdardottir, also a military spouse, staged and photographed Terran Echegoyen-McCabe and Christina Luna breastfeeding in uniform. Crystal Scott, the founder of Mom2Mom, said people thought the photograph was a disgrace to the uniform and compared their actions to defecating or urinating in uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McFarlane | first =  Megan D.  | title = Breastfeeding as subversive: mothers, mammaries and the military | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 191&amp;ndash;208 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14616742.2013.849967 | date = 2015 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616742.2013.849967 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some military personnel felt that it was impossible for a woman to maintain a professional military bearing while nursing in uniform.&lt;ref name=forget/&gt; But some active-duty veteran  military members who are also mothers were more supportive, suggesting that the women enhanced the prestige of the military.&lt;ref name="Weinstein"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinstein|first=Adam|title=Mother of All Wars: The Battle to Breastfeed in Uniform|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/05/breastfeeding-military-uniform|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=25 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423224313/https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/05/breastfeeding-military-uniform|archivedate=23 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The photographs quickly went viral and were shared worldwide.

Facebook has [[Criticism of Facebook#Breastfeeding photos|been criticized]] for removing photos of mothers breastfeeding their children, citing offensive content in violation of the Facebook Terms of Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/lex-appeal-2-breastfeeding/id359323807?i=85336196&amp;mt=2 |title=Episode 2: Breastfeeding and the Right to Go Topless |publisher=Lex Appeal |date=2010-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105549/https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/lex-appeal-2-breastfeeding/id359323807?i=85336196&amp;mt=2 |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook claimed that these photos violated their decency code by showing an exposed breast, even when the baby covered the nipple. This action was described as hypocritical, since Facebook took several days to respond to calls to deactivate a paid advertisement for a dating service that used a photo of a topless model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/facebook-mothers-outraged-at-breastfeeding-ban/2007/09/07/1188783470779.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Facebook ban incurs 'lactivist' wrath | date=2007-09-07 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221035037/http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/facebook-mothers-outraged-at-breastfeeding-ban/2007/09/07/1188783470779.html | archivedate=2009-02-21 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The breastfeeding photos controversy continued following public protests and the growth in the online membership in the Facebook group titled "Hey, Facebook, breastfeeding is not obscene!

'''Sir Charles Bell''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms= [[Knight of the Hanoverian Guelphic Order|KH]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|FRCSE]] [[Member of the Wernerian Society|MWS]]}} (12 November 1774{{spaced ndash}}28 April 1842) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] surgeon, [[anatomist]], [[physiologist]], [[neurologist]], artist, and [[philosophical theologian]]. He is noted for discovering the difference between [[sensory nerves]] and [[motor nerves]] in the spinal cord. He is also noted for describing [[Bell's palsy]].

His three older brothers included Robert Bell (1757–1816) a [[Society of Writers to Her Majesty's Signet|Writer to the Signet]],  [[John Bell (surgeon)|John Bell]] (1763–1820), also a noted surgeon and writer; and the advocate [[George Joseph Bell]] (1770–1843) who became a professor of law at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and a principal clerk at the [[Court of Session]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc2.ark:/13960/t4th8dz6z|title=The life and labours of Sir Charles Bell ...|last=Pichot|first=Amédée|date=1860-01-01|publisher=London :}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Charles Bell was born in [[Edinburgh]] on 12 November 1774,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1211566921.html |title=Sir Charles Bell: The artist who went to the roots!|journal= Journal of Postgraduate Medicine|date=April 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the fourth son of the Reverend William Bell, a clergyman of the [[Episcopal Church of Scotland]]. Charles's father died in 1779 when he was five years old, and thus his mother had a profound influence on his early life teaching him how to read and write.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to this, his mother also helped Charles’s natural artistic ability by paying for his regular drawing and painting lessons from [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]], a well-known Scottish painter.&lt;ref name="GrzybowskiKaufman2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grzybowski|first1=Andrzej|last2=Kaufman|first2=Matthew H.|title=Sir Charles Bell (1774−1842): contributions to neuro-ophthalmology|journal=Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica|volume=85|issue=8|year=2007|pages=897–901|issn=1395-3907|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.00972.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Bell grew up in Edinburgh, and attended the prestigious [[High School Edinburgh|High School]] (1784-8). Although he was not a particularly good student, Charles decided to follow in his brother John’s footsteps and enter a career in medicine.&lt;ref name="pmid21267589"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Gijn J |title=Charles Bell (1774-1842) |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=258 |issue=6 |pages=1189–90 |year=2011 |pmid=21267589 |pmc=3101348 |doi=10.1007/s00415-011-5912-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1792, Charles Bell enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and began assisting his brother John as a surgical apprentice. While at the university, Bell attended the lectures of [[Dugald Stewart]] on the subject of spiritual philosophy. These lectures had considerable impact on Bell, for some of Stewart’s teachings can be traced in Bell’s later works in a passage on his ''Treatise on the Hand''.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In addition to classes on anatomy, Bell took a course on the art of drawing in order to refine his artistic skill. At the university he was also a member of the [[Royal Medical Society]] as a student and spoke at the Society's centenary celebrations in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of the Royal Medical Society 1737-1937|last=Gray|first=James|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1952|isbn=|location=Edinburgh|pages=91, 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1798, Bell graduated from the University of Edinburgh and soon after was admitted to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Edinburgh College of Surgeons]] where he taught anatomy and operated at the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh|Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]]. While developing his talents as a surgeon, Bell’s interests forayed into a field combining anatomy and art. His inherent talent as an artist came to the fore when he helped his brother complete a four-volume work called ''The Anatomy of the Human Body''. Charles Bell completely wrote and illustrated volumes 3 and 4 in 1803, as well as publishing his own set of illustrations in a ''System of Dissections'' in 1798 and 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433082468293|title=Rambles in Europe, in 1839.With sketches of prominent surgeons, physicians, medical schools, hospitals, literary personages, scenery, etc.|last=Gibson|first=William|date=1841-01-01|publisher=Philadelphia,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Bell uses his clinical experience and his artistic eye to develop the hobby of modeling interesting medical cases in wax. He proceeded to accumulate an extensive collection that he dubbed his Museum of Anatomy, some items of which can still be seen today at [[Surgeons' Hall|Surgeon’s Hall]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Charles Bell’s stay in Edinburgh did not last long due to an infamous feud between John Bell and two faculty members at the University of Edinburgh: [[Alexander Monro (secundus)|Alexander Monro Secundus]] and John Gregory. John Gregory was the chairman of the Royal Infirmary and had declared that only six full-time surgical staff members would be appointed to work at the infirmary. The Bell brothers were not selected and thus barred from practicing medicine at the Royal Infirmary. Charles Bell, who was not directly involved in his brother’s feuds, attempted to make a deal with the faculty of the University of Edinburgh by offering the university one hundred guineas and his Museum of Anatomy in exchange for allowing him to observe and sketch the operations performed at the Royal Infirmary, but this deal was rejected.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== Professional career ==
In 1804, Charles Bell left for [[London]] and in 1805 had established himself in the city by buying a house on Leicester Street. From this house Bell taught classes in anatomy and surgery for medical students, doctors, and artists. In 1809, Bell volunteered to attend to the British troops wounded at Corunna and was one of the few civilian surgeons to do so. Bell primarily attended to amputees but was not very successful in his amputation surgeries, producing a 92% mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=Martin R|date=2005|title=A Surgical Artist at War: the Paintings and Sketches of Sir Charles Bell 1809–1815|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=98|issue=11|pages=517|issn=0141-0768|pmc=1276004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the amputation surgeries, Bell was quite fascinated by musket-ball injuries and in 1814, he published a ''Dissertation on Gunshot Wounds''. A number of his illustrations of the wounds are displayed in the hall of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grzybowski|first=Andrzej|last2=Kaufman|first2=Matthew H.|date=2007-12-01|title=Sir Charles Bell (1774−1842): contributions to neuro-ophthalmology|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.00972.x/abstract|journal=Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica|language=en|volume=85|issue=8|pages=897–901|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0420.2007.00972.x|issn=1600-0420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, Charles Bell married Marion Shaw. Using money from his wife's dowry, Bell purchased a share of the Great Windmill Street School of Anatomy which had been founded by the anatomist [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]]. Bell transferred his practice from his house to the Windmill Street School Bell ended up teaching students and conducting his own research until 1824. In 1813-14, he was appointed as a member of the London College of Surgeons and as a surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital.

In addition to his domestic pursuits, Bell also served as a military surgeon, making elaborate recordings of neurological injuries at the [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] and famously documenting his experiences at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815. For three consecutive days and nights, he operated on French soldiers in the Gens d'Armerie Hospital. The condition of the French soldiers was quite poor, and thus many of his patients died shortly after he operated on them. Dr. [[Robert Knox]], who was one of Bell’s surgical assistants at Brussells, was quite critical of Bell’s surgical skills. He commented very negatively on Bell's surgical abilities; (the mortality rate of amputations carried out by Bell ran at about 90%).

Bell was instrumental in the creation of the [[Middlesex Hospital]] Medical School, and became, in 1824, the first professor of Anatomy and Surgery of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|College of Surgeons in London]]. In that same year Bell sold his collection of over 3,000 wax preparations to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] for £3000.

In 1829, the Windmill Street School of Anatomy was incorporated into the new [[King's College London]]. Bell was invited to be its first professor of [[physiology]], and helped establish the Medical School at the University of London, gave the inaugural address when it formally opened, and even helped contribute to the requirements of its certification program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkowitz|first=Carin|date=2014-12-01|title=Charles Bell’s seeing hand: Teaching anatomy to the senses in Britain, 1750–1840|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0073275314559334|journal=History of Science|volume=52|issue=4|pages=377–400|doi=10.1177/0073275314559334|issn=0073-2753}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell's stay at the Medical School did not last long and he resigned from his chair due to differences of opinion with the academic staff. For the next seven years, Bell gave clinical lectures at the Middlesex Hospital and in 1835 he accepted the position of the Chair of Surgery at the University of Edinburgh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Bell, Sir Charles|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was made a Knight of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]] in 1833.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Bell died at Hallow Park near [[Worcester]] in the Midlands, while travelling from Edinburgh to London, in 1842.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

He is buried in [[Hallow, Worcestershire|Hallow]] Churchyard near [[Worcester]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
Bell was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] on 8 June 1807, on the nomination of [[Robert Jameson]], [[William Wright (botanist)|William Wright]] and [[Thomas Macknight]]. He served as a Councillor of the RSE from 1836-9.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of London]] on 16 November 1826,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=9&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27bell%27%29 | title= Library and Archive Catalogue | publisher= Royal Society | accessdate= 12 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the Royal Society's Gold Medal for his numerous discoveries in science. Bell was [[knight]]ed as a Knight of the Guelphic Order of Hanover in 1831 and, like [[Sir Richard Owen]], was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

Charles Bell was a prolific author who combined his anatomical knowledge with his artistic eye to produce a number of highly detailed and beautifully illustrated books. In 1799, Bell published his first work “''A System of Dissections, explaining the Anatomy of the Human Body, the manner of displaying Parts and their Varieties in Disease''”. His second work was the completion of his brother’s four-volume set of “''The Anatomy of the Human Body”'' in 1803. In that same year, Bell published his three series of engravings titled “''Engravings of the Arteries”'', “''Engravings of the Brain''”, and “''Engravings of the Nerves.”'' These set of engravings consisted of intricate and detailed anatomical diagrams accompanied with labels and a brief description of their functionality in the human body and were published as an educational tool for aspiring medical students. The “''Engravings of the Brain”'' are of particular importance for this marked Bell’s first published attempt at fully elucidating the organization of the nervous system. In his introduction to the work, Bell comments on the ambiguous nature of the brain and its inner workings, a topic that would hold his interest for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433011665720|title=The anatomy of the brain, explained in a series of engravings.|last=Bell|first=Charles|date=1802-01-01|publisher=London,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806, with his eye on a teaching post at the [[Royal Academy]], Bell published his ''Essays on The Anatomy of Expression in Painting'' (1806), later re-published as ''Essays on The Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression'' in 1824. In this work, Bell followed the principles of [[natural theology]], asserting the existence of a uniquely human system of [[facial muscles]] in the service of a [[human species]] with a unique relationship to the [[Creator deity|Creator]], ideals which paralleled with those of [[William Paley]].&lt;ref name=Hughes2018&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Sean|last2=Gardner-Thorpe|first2=Christopher|date=2018-08-31|title=Charles Bell (1774–1842) and Natural Theology|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0967772018790736|journal=Journal of Medical Biography|language=en|pages=0967772018790736|doi=10.1177/0967772018790736|issn=0967-7720}}{{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the failure of his application (Sir [[Thomas Lawrence]], later President of the Royal Academy, described Bell as "lacking in temper, modesty and judgement"), Bell turned his attentions to the nervous system.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Bell published detailed studies of the [[nervous system]] in 1811, in his privately circulated book ''An Idea of a New Anatomy of the Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1318665/pdf/janatphys00211-0151.pdf| title=REPRINT OF THE "IDEA OF A NEW ANATOMIY OF THE BRAIN|journal=J Anat Physiol|date= Nov 1868|pmc=1318665|pmid=17230788|volume=3|pages=147–82 |vauthors=Bell C, Shaw A }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Bell described his idea of the different nervous tracts connecting with different parts of brain and thus leading to different functionality. His experiments to investigate this consisted of cutting open the spinal cord of a rabbit and touching different columns of the cord.&lt;ref name="Dalton"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/miun.agq7673.0001.001|title=Vivisection; what it is, and what it has accomplished.|last=Dalton|first=John Call|date=1867-01-01|publisher=New York :}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that an irritation of the anterior columns led to a convulsion of the muscles, while an irritation of the posterior columns had no visible effect. These experiments led Bell to declare that he was the first to distinguish between sensory and motor nerves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044106446636|title=The experimental method in medical science.|last=Dalton|first=John Call|date=1882-01-01|publisher=New York,}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this essay is considered by many to be the founding stone of clinical neurology, it was not well received by Bell’s peers. His experimentation was criticized and the idea that he presented of the anterior and posterior roots being connected to the cerebrum and cerebellum respectively, was rejected. Furthermore, Bell's ''original'' essay of 1811 did not actually contain a clear description of motor and sensory [[nerve roots]] as Bell later claimed, and he seems to have issued subsequent incorrectly dated revisions with subtle textual alterations.&lt;ref name="pmid21267589"/&gt;

]]
Despite this lukewarm response, Charles Bell continued to study the anatomy of the human brain and laid his focus upon the nerves connected to it. In 1821, Bell published the ''“On the Nerves: Giving an Account of some Experiments on Their Structure and Functions, Which Lead to a New Arrangement of the System”'' in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. This paper held Bell’s most famous discovery, that the facial nerve or seventh cranial nerve is a nerve of muscular action. This was quite an important discovery because surgeons would often cut this nerve as an attempted cure for facial neuralgia, but this would often render the patient with a unilateral paralysis of the facial muscles, now known as Bell’s Palsy.&lt;ref name="Dalton"/&gt; Due to this publication, Charles Bell is regarded as one of the first physicians to combine the scientific study of neuroanatomy with clinical practice.

Bell's studies on [[emotional expression]] played a catalytic role in the development of Darwin's considerations of the origins of human emotional life; and, while he rejected Bell's theological arguments, Darwin very much agreed with Bell's emphasis on the expressive role of the [[muscles of respiration]]. Darwin detailed these opinions in his ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' (1872), written with the active collaboration of the psychiatrist [[James Crichton-Browne]]. 
Bell was one of the first physicians to combine the scientific study of neuroanatomy with clinical practice. In 1821, he described in the trajectory of the [[facial nerve]] and a disease, [[Bell's Palsy]] which led to the unilateral paralysis of facial muscles, in one of the classics of neurology, a paper delivered to the Royal Society entitled ''On the Nerves: Giving an Account of some Experiments on Their Structure an Functions, Which Lead to a New Arrangement of the System.''

Bell also combined his many artistic, scientific, literary and teaching talents in a number of wax preparations and detailed anatomical and surgical illustrations, paintings and engravings in his several books on these subjects, such as in his book ''Illustrations of the Great Operations of Surgery: Trepan, Hernia, Amputation, Aneurism, and Lithotomy'' (1821). He wrote also the first treatise on notions of anatomy and physiology of [[facial expression]] for painters and illustrators, titled ''Essays on the Anatomy of Expression in Painting'' (1806).

In 1829, Francis Egerton, the eighth Earl of Bridgewater, died and in his will, he left a large sum of money to the President of the Royal Society of London. The will stipulated that the money was to be used to write, print, and publish one thousand copies of a work On the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God. The President of the Royal Society, Davies Gilbert appointed eight gentlemen to write separate treatises on the subject. In 1833, he published the fourth [[Bridgewater Treatise]], ''The Hand: Its Mechanism and Vital Endowments as Evincing Design''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hand, Its Mechanism and Vital Endowments as Evincing Design|last=Bell|first=Charles|publisher=William Pickering|year=1833|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Bell published four editions of ''The Hand''. In the first few chapters, Bell organizes his treatise as an early textbook of comparative anatomy. The book is full of pictures where Bell compares “hands” of different organisms ranging from human hands, chimpanzee paws, and fish feelers. After the first few chapters, Bell orients his treatise around the significance of the hand and its importance in its use in anatomy.  He emphasizes that the hand is as important as the eye in the field of surgery and that it must be trained.

The Spanish Biomedical Research Centre in Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición: '''CIBERObn''') is a public [[research]] consortium which was founded on November 28, 2006 financed by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (ISCIII) and the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (MICINN).

The '''CIBERObn''' gathers 31 investigation groups from different Spanish Hospitals, Universities and Research Centres. Its mission is to promote a better knowledge about the mechanisms contributing to [[obesity]] development in order to reduce its incidence and prevalence, as well as its complications, in addition to [[nutrition]]-related diseases. 

The '''CIBERObn''' is structured into 8 scientific programs intended to increase the collaboration between researchers, to strengthen synergies and to boost new research lines. Programs are as follows: 

# '''Nutrition''': effects of different types of diet and nutrients on [[human health]].
# '''Adipobiology''': identification of new signals released by the [[adipose tissue]] which are involved in the regulation of [[energy homeostasis]].
# '''Obesity and Cancer''': role of those proteins associated with [[cell cycle]] on metabolic control and obesity development.
# '''Obesity and Cardiovascular risk''': hemodynamic, metabolic and inflammatory factors associated to cardiac and vascular diseases in obesity.
# '''Neurocognitive and Environmental Factors''': environmental and emotional factors in nutrition and obesity disorders.
# '''Obesity in Childhood-Adolescence Period''': biochemical, hormonal, metabolic, genetic, proteomic and body-composition study in children and adolescents.
# '''Biomarkers''': new strategies, therapeutic and prevention technologies, [[biomarker]]s of obesity.
# '''Biological Models and Therapeutic Targets''': development and validation of experimental models and therapeutic targets in case of obesity.

Additionally, CIBERObn lays a particular emphasis on [[translational research]], specially focusing on research transfer to clinical applications and practices. To this end, two cross-cutting programs have been created: 
* '''Staff Training and Recruitment''', which is intended to train our staff according to our research lines and priorities
* “'''Fat Bank'''” Structural Program: [[biobank]] infrastructure connecting the above-mentioned programs in a cross way by contributing with common solutions.

The Fat Bank is a strategic platform of the CIBERObn which offers the Scientific Community different kinds of biological material which are associated to thorough metabolic [[phenotyping]]. This information is entered by means of a tailor-made individualised software. This fat-bank- launched in 2009- currently contains 3000 samples of biologic material from more than 300 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundosalud/2011/07/12/corazon/1310490938.html|title=Nace el primer biobanco español de tejido adiposo {{!}} Corazón {{!}} elmundo.es|last=Internet|first=Unidad Editorial|website=www.elmundo.es|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, 287 indexed articles were published. Their average [[impact factor]] is 4.05, which is very high for this subject area. Of them, 67 (23%) belong to the first decile and 105 more (total 172 papers, 60%) belong to the first quartile of the subject area of indexed journals. They accumulate a total impact factor of 1,165. Provisional data of 2010 show an increase of 10%, highly improving the international visibility of the consortium.

'''Colostrinin''' (also known as '''CLN''', '''proline-rich polypeptides''' or '''PRP''') is a naturally occurring mixture of [[proline]]-rich polypeptides derived from [[colostrum]].

==Early work on Colostrinin==

Colostrinin was originally identified by scientists working in Poland in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Staroscik |first1=K |last2=Janusz |first2=M |last3=Zimecki |first3=M |last4=Wieczorek |first4=Z |last5=Lisowski |first5=J |title=Immunologically active nonapeptide fragment of a proline-rich polypeptide from ovine colostrum: Amino acid sequence and immunoregulatory properties☆ |journal=Molecular Immunology |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=1277–82 |year=1983 |pmid=6656774 |doi=10.1016/0161-5890(83)90157-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason=The provided reference lists a publication made in 1983, which does not support the claim about 70s|date=July 2017}} Colostrinin is derived from colostrum, which is present in the pre-milk fluid produced from mammary glands in the first few days after parturition. It is also known as [[proline-rich polypeptides]], since sequence analysis of the peptides present in this mixture reveals an unusually high proportion of this [[amino acid]] residue. The amino acid compositions of Colostrinin from ovine, bovine, and human colostrum are very similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kruzel |first1=Marion L. |last2=Janusz |first2=Maria |last3=Lisowski |first3=Jozef |last4=Fischleigh |first4=Robert V. |last5=Georgiades |first5=Jerzy A. |title=Towards an Understanding of Biological Role of Colostrinin Peptides |journal=Journal of Molecular Neuroscience |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=379–89 |year=2001 |pmid=11859934 |doi=10.1385/JMN:17:3:379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colostrinin was first characterized in animal and in-vitro studies as a substance that generally stimulates the immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Janusz |first1=M |last2=Lisowski |first2=J |title=Proline-rich polypeptide (PRP)--an immunomodulatory peptide from ovine colostrum |journal=Archivum Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis |volume=41 |issue=5–6 |pages=275–9 |year=1993 |pmid=8010865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an immunomodulatory action may be important in the treatment of a variety of diseases and is consistent with the beneficial effect of colostrum in promoting the development of the immune system in newborn mammals.

==Preparation and synthesis==

Colostrinin is obtained from bovine colostrum by alcohol extraction and filtration. A patented method &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kruzel |first1=Marian L. |last2=Polanowski |first2=Antoni |last3=Wilusz |first3=Tadeusz |last4=Sokołowska |first4=Agata |last5=Pacewicz |first5=Magdalena |last6=Bednarz |first6=Renata |last7=Georgiades |first7=Jerzy A. |title=The Alcohol-Induced Conformational Changes in Casein Micelles: A New Challenge for the Purification of Colostrinin |journal=The Protein Journal |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=127–33 |year=2004 |pmid=15106878 |doi=10.1023/B:JOPC.0000020079.76155.9d}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines the steps that can be used to produce this substance on an industrial scale. In this method, an alcohol, such as [[ethanol]] or [[methanol]], is used to create an alcohol phase. This phase is enriched with the peptide fraction, from which Colostrinin is recovered and purified.

Colostrinin is incompletely defined chemically. Initially, it was assumed to consist of a single protein with a molecular weight of approximately 17 to 18 kDa. However, subsequent studies showed that Colostrinin largely consists of a mixture of at least 32 [[peptides]] ranging in size from 0.5 to 3 kDa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rattray |first1=M |title=Technology evaluation: colostrinin, ReGen |journal=Current Opinion in Molecular Therapeutics |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=78–84 |year=2005 |pmid=15732533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the peptides appear to be derived from proteolytic processing of the milk proteins β-casein and a β-casein homolog. Whether non-peptide components of the mixture contribute to the biological activity is unknown. However, the biological activity of Colostrinin does seem to be due to more than one of the components, since its effects cannot be completely mimicked by any one of the peptide components tested so far.

==Health benefits==

PRP-rich preparations from bovine colostrum have shown possible efficacy against various illnesses including neurodegenerative diseases (such as [[Alzheimer's]]), viral infections, and ailments characterized by an overactive [[immune system]], such as allergies, [[asthma]] and autoimmune diseases.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Some recent research has also indicated possible efficacy in combating [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szaniszlo |first1=P |last2=German |first2=P |last3=Hajas |first3=G |last4=Saenz |first4=D |last5=Woodberry |first5=M |last6=Kruzel |first6=M |last7=Boldogh |first7=I |title=Effects of Colostrinin™ on gene expression-transcriptomal network analysis |journal=International Immunopharmacology |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=181–93 |year=2009 |pmid=19015048 |doi=10.1016/j.intimp.2008.10.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colostrinin’s potential as a cognitive enhancer is fairly well-documented.

Significant research has been done on Colostrinin’s possible efficacy in Alzheimer's disease,&lt;ref name="Pmid_a"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leszek |first1=J |last2=Inglot |first2=AD |last3=Janusz |first3=M |last4=Lisowski |first4=J |last5=Krukowska |first5=K |last6=Georgiades |first6=JA |title=Colostrinin: a proline-rich polypeptide (PRP) complex isolated from ovine colostrum for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study |journal=Archivum Immunologiae et Therapiae Experimentalis |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=377–85 |year=1999 |pmid=10608295}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most common form of dementia  The disease is characterized by extracellular senile plaques consisting mainly of aggregated amyloid-beta (Aß) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, containing the cytoskeletal protein tau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kubis |first1=AM |last2=Janusz |first2=M |title=Alzheimer's disease: new prospects in therapy and applied experimental models |journal=Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online) |volume=62 |pages=372–92 |year=2008 |pmid=18688208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A placebo-controlled clinical trial with Colostrinin in 106 people with Alzheimer's over 30 weeks was completed in 2002 and the results appeared to demonstrate efficacy in a significant proportion of patients treated.&lt;ref name="Pmid"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bilikiewicz |first1=A |last2=Gaus |first2=W |title=Colostrinin (a naturally occurring, proline-rich, polypeptide mixture) in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease |journal=Journal of Alzheimer's Disease |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=17–26 |year=2004 |pmid=15004324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results showed that approximately 40% of patients on Colostrinin were stabilized or improved after 15 weeks of therapy, based on an Analysis of Overall Response. 33% of patients continued to show stabilization or improvement after 30 weeks of treatment, although levels of benefit were slightly higher at the 15-week stage of the trial. The dosage regimen used for the trial was 100 micrograms of Colostrinin administered every second day for three weeks followed by a two-week period without Colostrinin.

A 2010 study demonstrated that Colostrinin significantly relieved amyloid-beta (Aß)-induced cytotoxicity, alleviated the effect of Aß-induced cytotoxicity and caused a significant reduction in the elevated levels of the antioxidant enzyme SOD1.&lt;ref name="FroudWardhaugh2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Froud|first1=Kristina E.|last2=Wardhaugh|first2=Tina|last3=Banks|first3=Duncan|last4=Saffrey|first4=M. Jill|last5=Stewart|first5=Michael G.|title=Colostrinin™ Alleviates Amyloid-β Induced Toxicity in Rat Primary Hippocampal Cultures|journal=Journal of Alzheimer's Disease|volume=20|issue=2|year=2010|pages=423–426|issn=1875-8908|doi=10.3233/JAD-2010-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An in-vitro study completed in 2005 showed that Colostrinin can increase the lifespan of cells isolated from inbred mice predisposed to premature aging and death.&lt;ref&gt;I. Boldogh; A. Bacsi; L. Agulera-Aguirre; P. German; M. Kruzel; Colostrinin Increases the Lifespan and Neurological Performance of Mice, 03, 2008.{{Unreliable medical source|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study showed the effect of Colostrinin on the [[mitochondria]] of cells isolated from strains of senescence-prone (SAMP1) and senescence-resistant (SAMR1) mice. The data showed that cells from SAMP1 mice produce more reactive oxygen species (ROS), exhibit severe mitochondrial dysfunction, and have a decreased lifespan compared to the cells from SAMR1 mice. Addition of Colostrinin to SAMP1 cells significantly decreased ROS levels, normalized mitochondrial function and increased the lifespan to levels similar to those in SAMR1 cells. This in-vitro effect was followed up in actual mice as well.

Another study showed that Colostrinin induces neurite outgrowth of pheochromocytoma cells and inhibits beta amyloid-induced [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bacsi |first1=A |last2=Woodberry |first2=M |last3=Kruzel |first3=M |last4=Boldogh |first4=I |title=Colostrinin delays the onset of proliferative senescence of diploid murine fibroblast cells |journal=Neuropeptides |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=93–101 |year=2007 |pmid=17300837 |doi=10.1016/j.npep.2006.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neurite outgrowth caused by Colostrinin appears to activate signaling pathways common to cell proliferation and differentiation, and to mediate a wide spectrum of activities that are similar to those of hormones and known nerve growth factors. These findings would seem to suggest that Colostrinin treatment may control the expression of genes that are involved in the development, maintenance, and regeneration of neurons in the central nervous system, and thus may also explain the improvements observed in Alzheimer's patients with mild-to-moderate [[dementia]] during treatment with Colostrinin.
Colostrinin affects the early stages of Vitamin D3-induced phenotypic (CD11b and CD14) and functional (phagocytic) differentiation/maturation of monocytes/macrophages. When Colostrinin was administered to the cells after treatment with Vitamin D3, no attenuation of the differentiation/maturation process of the HL-60 cells was observed. Therefore, Colostrinin may regulate in this way the inflammatory processes in which these cells participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kubis |first1=A |last2=Marcinkowska |first2=E |last3=Janusz |first3=M |last4=Lisowski |first4=J |title=Studies on the mechanism of action of a proline-rich polypeptide complex (PRP): Effect on the stage of cell differentiation |journal=Peptides |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages=2188–92 |year=2005 |pmid=15904991 |doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2005.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study in day-old domestic chicks showed enhancement of long-term memory retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=M |last2=Banks |first2=D |title=Enhancement of long-term memory retention by Colostrinin in one-day-old chicks trained on a weak passive avoidance learning paradigm |journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=66–71 |year=2006 |pmid=16473531 |doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2005.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch and published online in March 2008 in the International Archives of Allergy and Immunology showed that Colostrinin is non-allergenic and can prevent allergic inflammation due to common indoor and outdoor [[allergens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boldogh |first1=Istvan |last2=Aguilera-Aguirre |first2=Leopoldo |last3=Bacsi |first3=Attila |last4=Choudhury |first4=Barun K. |last5=Saavedra-Molina |first5=Alfredo |last6=Kruzel |first6=Marian |title=Colostrinin Decreases Hypersensitivity and Allergic Responses to Common Allergens |journal=International Archives of Allergy and Immunology |volume=146 |issue=4 |pages=298–306 |year=2008 |pmid=18367843 |doi=10.1159/000121464}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study used a well characterized mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. Colostrinin (given orally, intranasally or intraperitoneally) significantly decreased IgE/IgG1 production, airway eosinophilia, mucin production and hypersensitivity induced by allergenic extracts from ragweed pollen and house dust mites. In contrast, colostrum induced positive inflammatory responses.

==Anti-aging potential==

A 2006 study published in the Journal of Experimental Therapeutics and Oncology indicated that Colostrinin may affect the [[aging]] process by reducing the spontaneous or induced mutation frequency in the [[DNA]] of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bacsi |first1=A |last2=Aguilera-Aguirre |first2=L |last3=German |first3=P |last4=Kruzel |first4=ML |last5=Boldogh |first5=I |title=Colostrinin decreases spontaneous and induced mutation frequencies at the hprt locus in Chinese hamster V79 cells |journal=Journal of experimental therapeutics &amp; oncology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=249–59 |year=2006 |pmid=17024966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such DNA damage is implicated in the general process of aging. The study, which was performed in both hamster and human cells, looked at the effect of Colostrinin on the frequency of defined DNA mutations in these cells as they occur naturally and when induced by various known chemical or physical agents. In cells stressed oxidatively, Colostrinin reduced the frequency of mutation induced by [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) to nearly background levels in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, Colostrinin reduced the frequency of mutation caused by two mutagenic agents, [[methyl methane sulfonate]] and [[mitomycin-C]], the latter often used in [[cancer]] [[chemotherapy]]. Notably Colostrinin decreased UVA and UVB radiation induced mutation frequency. These damaging radiations are a natural part of sunlight. UVA radiation plays a role in the induction of malignant [[melanoma]] and UVB radiation is the primary cause of squamous cell carcinomas. It is suggested that the antimutagenic properties of Colostrinin are achieved via multiple mechanisms - by decreasing intracellular levels of ROS and so preventing DNA damage and by increasing the efficiency of natural DNA repair mechanisms.

There were also studies of the Colostrinin components and their possible effect on aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta1-42). Results presented suggest that NP - Colostrinin component, can directly interact with amyloid beta, inhibit its aggregation and disrupt existing aggregates acting as a beta sheet breaker and reduce toxicity induced by aggregated forms of Abeta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Janusz |first1=Maria |last2=Woszczyna |first2=Mirosław |last3=Lisowski |first3=Marek |last4=Kubis |first4=Adriana |last5=MacAła |first5=JóZefa |last6=Gotszalk |first6=Teodor |last7=Lisowski |first7=Józef |title=Ovine colostrum nanopeptide affects amyloid beta aggregation |journal=FEBS Letters |volume=583 |issue=1 |pages=190–6 |year=2009 |pmid=19084010 |doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2008.11.053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==

There has been very little mention of toxicity in most published animal studies using Colostrinin, which may suggest that it exhibits low toxicity.

A '''dental implant''' (also known as an '''endosseous implant''' or '''fixture''') is a surgical component that interfaces with the bone of the jaw or skull to support a [[dental prosthesis]] such as a [[crown (dentistry)|crown]], [[bridge (dentistry)|bridge]], [[dentures|denture]], facial prosthesis or to act as an [[Dental braces|orthodontic anchor]]. The basis for modern dental implants is a biologic process called [[osseointegration]], in which  materials such as [[titanium]] form an intimate bond to bone. The implant fixture is first placed so that it is likely to osseointegrate, then a dental prosthetic is added. A variable amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic (a tooth, bridge or denture) is attached to the implant or an [[abutment (dentistry)|abutment]] is placed which will hold a dental prosthetic.

Success or failure of implants depends on the health of the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic since [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] forces created during [[mastication|chewing]] can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using [[computed tomography]] with [[CAD/CAM]] simulations and surgical guides called [[stent]]s. The prerequisites for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy [[bone]] and [[gingiva]]. Since both can [[atrophy]] after [[tooth extraction]], pre-prosthetic procedures such as [[sinus lift]]s or [[gingival graft]]s are sometimes  required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva.

The final prosthetic can be either fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the prosthetic. In each case an abutment is attached to the implant fixture. Where the prosthetic is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the abutment either with [[lag screw]]s or with [[dental cement]]. Where the prosthetic is removable, a corresponding adapter is placed in the prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together.

The risks and complications related to implant therapy divide into those that occur during surgery (such as excessive bleeding or nerve injury), those that occur in the first six months (such as infection and failure to osseointegrate) and those that occur long-term (such as [[peri-implantitis]] and mechanical failures). In the presence of healthy tissues, a well-integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads can have 5-year plus survival rates from 93 to 98 percent&lt;ref name="main1"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Implant and Prosthodontic Survival Rates with Implant Fixed Complete Dental Prostheses in the Edentulous Mandible after at Least 5 Years: A Systematic Review |author1= Papaspyridakos, P. |author2= Mokti, M. |author3= Chen, C.

The primary use of dental implants is to support [[dental prosthesis|dental prosthetics]]. Modern dental implants make use of [[osseointegration]], the biologic process where bone fuses tightly to the surface of specific materials such as titanium and some ceramics. The integration of implant and bone can support physical loads for decades without failure.&lt;ref name="Misch"&gt;{{cite book | title=Contemporary Implant Dentistry | publisher=Mosby Elsevier | author=Misch, Carl E | year=2007 | location=St. Louis, Missouri}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=103–107}}

For individual tooth replacement, an ''implant abutment'' is first secured to the implant with an abutment screw. A [[dental crown|crown]] (the dental prosthesis) is then connected to the abutment with [[dental cement]], a small screw, or fused with the abutment as one piece during fabrication.&lt;ref name="branemark"&gt;{{cite book | title=Tissue-integrated prostheses (in English) | publisher=Quintessence Books |author1=c Branemark, Per-Ingvar |author2=Zarb, George | year=1989 | location=Berlin, German | isbn=0867151293}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=211–232}}  Dental implants, in the same way, can also be used to retain a multiple tooth dental prosthesis either in the form of a [[fixed prosthodontics|fixed bridge]] or [[dentures|removable dentures]].

An implant supported [[bridge (dentistry)|bridge]] (or fixed denture) is a group of teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as [[bridge (dentistry)|pontics]]. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments in the same way as a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.&lt;ref name="branemark" /&gt;

A removable implant supported [[denture]] (also an implant supported overdenture&lt;ref name="Jokstad"&gt;{{cite book | title=Osseointegration and Dental Implants (in English) | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Jokstad, Asbjorn, ed. | year=2009 | isbn=9780813804743}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=31}}) is a type of dental prosthesis which is not permanently fixed in place. The dental prosthesis can be disconnected from the implant abutments with finger pressure by the wearer. To enable this, the abutment is shaped as a small connector (a button, ball, bar or magnet) which can be connected to analogous adapters in the underside of the dental prosthesis. [[Craniofacial prosthesis|Facial prosthetics]], used to correct facial deformities (e.g. from [[Head and neck cancer|cancer]] treatment or injuries) can use connections to implants placed in the facial bones.&lt;ref name="Sinn"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Craniofacial Implant Surgery | author=Sinn, D. P., Bedrossian, E., Vest, A. K. | journal=Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America | year=2011 | volume=23 | issue=2 | pages=321–335 | doi=10.1016/j.coms.2011.01.005 | pmid=21492804| last2=Bedrossian | last3=Vest }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on the situation the implant may be used to retain either a fixed or removable prosthetic that replaces part of the face.&lt;ref name="Arcuri"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Titanium implants in maxillofacial reconstruction | author=Arcuri MR | journal=Otolaryngol Clin N Am | date=Apr 1995 | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages=351–63| pmid=7596615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[dental braces|orthodontics]], small diameter dental implants, referred to as [[Temporary Anchorage Devices]] (or TADs) can assist tooth movement by creating anchor points from which forces can be generated.&lt;ref name="miniimplant"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Critical factors for the success of orthodontic mini-implants: A systematic review |author1=Chen, Y. |author2=Kyung, H. M. |author3=Zhao, W. T. |author4=Yu, W. J. | journal=American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics | year=2009 | volume=135 | issue=3 | pages=284–291 | doi=10.1016/j.ajodo.2007.08.017 | pmid=19268825}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For teeth to move, a force must be applied to them in the direction of the desired movement. The force stimulates [[osteocyte|cells]] in the periodontal ligament to cause [[bone remodeling]], removing bone in the direction of travel of the tooth and adding it to the space created. In order to generate a force on a tooth, an anchor point (something that will not move) is needed. Since implants do not have a periodontal ligament, and bone remodelling will not be stimulated when tension is applied, they are ideal anchor points in orthodontics. Typically, implants designed for orthodontic movement are small and do not fully osseointegrate, allowing easy removal following treatment.&lt;ref name="Lee2007"&gt;{{cite book | title=Applications of orthodontic mini implants | publisher=Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc | author=Lee, SL | year=2007 | location=Hanover Park, IL | pages=1–11 | isbn=9780867154658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General considerations===
Planning for dental implants focuses on the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of the bones of the jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of [[gum disease]] that affects implants called [[peri-implantitis]], increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, [[osteoporosis]] and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.&lt;ref name="branemark"/&gt;{{rp|page=199}}

It has been suggested that [[Radiation therapy|radiotherapy]] can negatively affect the survival of implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shugaa-Addin|first=Bassam|last2=Al-Shamiri|first2=Hashem-Motahir|last3=Al-Maweri|first3=Sadeq|last4=Tarakji|first4=Bassel|date=2016-04-01|title=The effect of radiotherapy on survival of dental implants in head and neck cancer patients |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Dentistry|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e194–e200|doi=10.4317/jced.52346 | pmc=4808316|pmid=27034761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a systemic study published in 2016 concluded that dental implants installed in the irradiated area of an oral cavity may have a high survival rate, provided that the patient maintains oral hygiene measures and regular follow ups to prevent complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejpd.org/article/S0022-3913(16)30195-0/abstract|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bisphosphonate drugs===
The use of bone building drugs, like [[bisphosphonates]] and [[Denosumab|anti-RANKL]] drugs require special consideration with implants, because they have been associated with a disorder called [[Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw]] (BRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger for months or years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the [[American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons]], discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed&lt;ref name="Ruggiero"&gt;{{cite journal | title=American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons Position Paper on Bisphosphonate-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaws—2009 Update |author1=Ruggiero, S. L. |author2=Dodson, T. B. |author3=Assael, L. A. |author4=Landesberg, R. |author5=Marx, R. E. |author6=Mehrotra, B. | journal=J Oral and Maxillofac Surg | year=2009 | volume=67 | issue=5 | pages=2–12 | doi=10.1016/j.joms.2009.01.009 | pmid=19371809}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival.&lt;ref name="Kumar"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Survival of dental implants in bisphosphonate users versus non-users: A systematic review |author1=Kumar, M. N. |author2=Honne, T. | journal=The European journal of prosthodontics and restorative dentistry | year=2012 | volume=20 | issue=4 | pages=159–162| pmid=23495556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biomechanical considerations===
The long-term success of implants is determined, in part, by the forces they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support.&lt;ref name="Branemark1992"&gt;{{cite book | title=Advanced osseointegration surgery: applications in the maxillofacial region (in english) | publisher=Quintessence Books | author=Branemark, Per-Ingvar  Worthington, Philip, ed | year=1992 | location=Carol Stream, Illinois | isbn=0867152427}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=15–39}} Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Optimal implant positioning and soft tissue management for the Branemark system (in english) | publisher=Quintessence Books | author=Pallaci, Patrick | year=1995 | location=Germany | pages=21–33 | isbn=0867153083}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the [[mandible|bottom jaw]] have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the [[maxilla|upper jaw]]. People who [[bruxism|grind their teeth]] also increase the force on implants and increase the likelihood of failures.&lt;ref name="branemark"/&gt;{{rp|page=201–208}}

The design of implants has to account for a lifetime of real-world use in a person's mouth. Regulators and the dental implant industry have created a series of [[Reliability engineering|tests]] to determine the long-term mechanical reliability of implants in a person's mouth where the implant is struck repeatedly with increasing forces (similar in magnitude to biting) until it fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm072424.htm| title=Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Root-form Endosseous Dental Implants and Endosseous Dental Abutments |publisher=FDA |date=2004-05-12 |accessdate= 2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a more exacting plan is needed beyond clinical judgment, the dentist will make an acrylic guide (called a stent) prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get a [[cone beam computed tomography|CT scan]] of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on [[CAD/CAM Dentistry|CAD/CAM]] software. The stent can then be made using [[stereolithography]] following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the [[inferior alveolar nerve]] and the sinus.&lt;ref name="Spector"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Computer-Aided Dental Implant Planning | author=Spector, L | journal=Dental Clinics of N Amer | year=2008 | volume=52 | issue=4 | pages=761–775 | doi=10.1016/j.cden.2008.05.004 | pmid=18805228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LindheJ"&gt;{{cite book | title=Clinical Periodontology and Implant Dentistry 5th edition (in English) | publisher=Blackwell Munksgaard | author=Lindhe, Jan; Lang, Niklaus P; Karring, Thorkild, eds. | year=2008 | location=Oxford, UK | isbn=9781405160995}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=1199}}

====Placing the implant====
Most implant systems have five basic steps for placement of each implant:&lt;ref name="branemark"/&gt;{{rp|pages=214–221}}

# Soft tissue reflection: An incision is made over the crest of bone, splitting the thicker [[gingiva|attached gingiva]] roughly in half so that the final implant will have a thick band of tissue around it. The edges of tissue, each referred to as a ''flap'' are pushed back to expose the bone. Flapless surgery is an alternate technique, where a small punch of tissue (the diameter of the implant) is removed for implant placement rather than raising flaps.
# Drilling at high speed: After reflecting the soft tissue, and using a surgical guide or stent as necessary, pilot holes are placed with precision drills at highly regulated speed to prevent burning or pressure necrosis of the bone.
# Drilling at low speed: The pilot hole is expanded by using progressively wider drills (typically between three and seven successive drilling steps, depending on implant width and length). Care is taken not to damage the [[osteoblast]] or bone cells by overheating. A cooling [[saline (medicine)|saline]] or water spray keeps the [[temperature]] low.
# Placement of the implant: The implant screw is placed and can be [[self-tapping]],&lt;ref name="LindheJ"/&gt;{{rp|pages=100–102}} otherwise the prepared site is tapped with an implant analog. It is then screwed into place with a [[dental torque wrench|torque controlled wrench]]&lt;ref name="McCrackenMitchell2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCracken|first1=Michael S.|last2=Mitchell|first2=Lillian|last3=Hegde|first3=Rashmi|last4=Mavalli|first4=Mahendra D.|title=Variability of Mechanical Torque-Limiting Devices in Clinical Service at a US Dental School|journal=Journal of Prosthodontics|volume=19|issue=1|year=2010|pages=20–24|issn=1059-941X|doi=10.1111/j.1532-849X.2009.00524.x|pmid=19765196}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a precise [[torque]] so as not to overload the surrounding bone (overloaded bone can die, a condition called osteonecrosis, which may lead to failure of the implant to fully integrate or bond with the jawbone).
#  Tissue adaptation: The [[gingiva]] is adapted around the entire implant to provide a thick band of healthy tissue around the ''healing abutment''. In contrast, an implant can be "buried", where the top of the implant is sealed with a ''cover screw'' and the tissue is closed to completely cover it. A second procedure  would then be required to uncover the implant at a later date.

====Timing of implants after extraction of teeth====
There are different approaches to placement dental implants after tooth extraction.&lt;ref name="Esposito90"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Timing of implant placement after tooth extraction: Immediate, immediate-delayed or delayed implants?

#Immediate post-extraction implant placement.
#Delayed immediate post-extraction implant placement (two weeks to three months after extraction).
#Late implantation (three months or more after tooth extraction).

There are also various options for when to attach teeth to dental implants,&lt;ref name="loadtimes" /&gt; classified into:
#Immediate loading procedure.
#Early loading (one week to twelve weeks).
#Delayed loading (over three months)

====Healing time====
&lt;!--single implant procedure links here--&gt;
For an implant to become [[Primary implant stability|permanently stable]], the body must grow bone to the surface of the implant ([[osseointegration]]). Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).&lt;ref name="branemark"/&gt;

However, later research suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 [[Newton metre|Ncm]]) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months.&lt;ref name="loadtimes"/&gt; The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.&lt;ref name="Atieh"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Immediate loading with single implant crowns: A systematic review and meta-analysis |author1=Atieh, M. A. |author2=Atieh, A. H. |author3=Payne, A. G. |author4=Duncan, W. J. | journal=The International journal of prosthodontics | year=2009 | volume=22 | issue=4 | pages=378–387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|healing abutment}}One versus two-stage surgery====
After an implant is placed, the internal components are covered with either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is flush with the surface of the dental implant, and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.&lt;ref name="Peterson2004"&gt;{{cite book | title=Peterson's Principles of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, 2nd Edition | publisher=PMPH-USA | author=Peterson, LJ. Miloro, M | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=190–1}}

In the early stages of implant development (1970−1990), implant systems used a two-stage approach, believing that it improved the odds of initial implant survival. Subsequent research suggests that no difference in implant survival existed between one-stage and two-stage surgeries, and the choice of whether or not to "bury" the implant in the first stage of surgery became a concern of soft tissue ([[gingiva]]) management&lt;ref name="esposito608"&gt;{{cite journal | title=One-stage versus two-stage implant placement. A Cochrane systematic review of randomised controlled clinical trials |author1=Esposito, M. |author2=Grusovin, M. G. |author3=Chew, Y. S. |author4=Coulthard, P. |author5=Worthington, H. V. | journal=European journal of oral implantology | year=2009 | volume=2 | issue=2 | pages=91–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When tissue is deficient or mutilated by the loss of teeth, implants are placed and allowed to osseointegrate, then the gingiva is surgically moved around the healing abutments. The down-side of a two-stage technique is the need for additional surgery and compromise of circulation to the tissue due to repeated surgeries.&lt;ref name="Sclar2003"&gt;{{cite book | title=Soft tissue and esthetic considerations in implant dentistry (in english) | publisher=Quintessence Books | author=Sclar, Anthony | year=2003 | location=Carol Stream, IL | isbn=0867153547}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=9–12}} The choice of one or two-stages, now centers around how best to reconstruct the soft tissues around lost teeth.

====Immediate placement====
An increasingly common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes the placement of a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.&lt;ref name="Esposito90" /&gt;

For an implant to [[osseointegration|osseointegrate]], it needs to be surrounded by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, it needs to have a thick healthy soft tissue ([[gingiva]]) envelope around it. It is common for either the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.&lt;ref name="LindheJ"/&gt;{{rp|page=1084}}

====Hard tissue (bone) reconstruction====
{{Main|Sinus lift |Bone grafting}}
''[[Bone grafting]]'' is necessary when there is a lack of bone. While there are always new implant types, such as short implants, and techniques to allow compromise, a general treatment goal is to have a minimum of 10&amp;nbsp;mm in bone height, and 6&amp;nbsp;mm in width. Alternatively, bone defects are graded from A to D (A=10+&amp;nbsp;mm of bone, B=7–9&amp;nbsp;mm, C=4–6&amp;nbsp;mm and D=0–3&amp;nbsp;mm) where an implant's likelihood of osseointegrating is related to the grade of bone.&lt;ref name="Buser"&gt;{{cite book | title=Guided bone regeneration in implant dentistry (in english) | publisher=Quintessence Books |author1=Buser, Daniel |author2=Schenk, Robert K | year=1994 | location=Hong Kong | isbn=0867152494}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=250}}

To achieve an adequate width and height of bone, various bone grafting techniques have been developed. The most frequently used is called [[Guided bone and tissue regeneration|guided bone graft augmentation]] where a defect is filled with either natural (harvested or autograft) bone or allograft (donor bone or synthetic bone substitute), covered with a semi-permeable membrane and allowed to heal. During the healing phase, natural bone replaces the graft forming a new bony base for the implant.&lt;ref name="Peterson2004"/&gt;{{rp|223}}

Three common procedures are:&lt;ref name="Buser"/&gt;{{rp|page=236}}
# The [[Maxillary sinus floor augmentation procedure|sinus lift]]
# Lateral [[Guided bone and tissue regeneration|alveolar augmentation]] (increase in the width of a site)
# Vertical alveolar augmentation (increase in the height of a site)

Other, more invasive procedures, also exist for larger bone defects including mobilization of the [[inferior alveolar nerve]] to allow placement of a fixture, [[bone grafting|onlay bone grafting]] using the [[iliac crest]] or another large source of bone and [[Microsurgery#Free tissue transfer|microvascular bone graft]] where the blood supply to the bone is transplanted with the source bone and [[Surgical anastomosis|reconnected]] to the local blood supply.&lt;ref name="Branemark1992"/&gt;{{rp|pages=5–6}} The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best is based on an assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3&amp;nbsp;mm loss), moderate (4–6&amp;nbsp;mm loss) or severe (greater than 6&amp;nbsp;mm loss).&lt;ref name="Laskin"&gt;{{cite book | title=Decision making in oral and maxillofacial surgery | publisher=Quintessence Pub.

The [[gingiva]] surrounding a tooth has a 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm band of bright pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, a band of strong, attached gingiva is needed to keep the implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva surrounding an implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer [[biologic width]]).&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book | title=Carranza's Clinical Periodontology (in English) | publisher=Elsevier Saunders | author=Newman, Michael; Takei, Henry; Klokkevold, Perry, eds. | year=2012 | location=St. Louis, Missouri | isbn=9781437704167}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=629–633}}

When an adequate band of attached tissue is absent, it can be recreated with a soft tissue graft. There are four methods that can be used to transplant soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (buccal), [[gingival graft|gingiva from the palate]] can be transplanted, deeper [[subepithelial connective tissue graft|connective tissue from the palate]] can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.&lt;ref name="Sclar2003"/&gt;{{rp|pages=113–188}}

Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, a band of full, plump gingiva is needed to fill in the space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue complication is called a black-triangle, where the [[Interdental papilla|papilla]] (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.&lt;ref name="LindheJ"/&gt;{{rp|pages=81–84}}

==Recovery==
[[File:Dental-implant.gif|thumb|200px|right|The steps taken to secure dental crowns on the implant fixture including placement of the abutment and crown]]
The prosthetic phase begins once the implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance that it will integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even in the event of early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the [[vertical dimension of occlusion]], the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.&lt;ref name="branemark"/&gt;{{rp|pages=241–251}}

'''Prosthetic procedures for single teeth, bridges and fixed dentures'''

An abutment is selected depending on the application. In many single crown and fixed partial denture scenarios (bridgework), custom abutments are used. An impression of the top of the implant is made  with the adjacent teeth and gingiva. A dental lab then simultaneously fabricates an abutment and crown. The abutment is seated on the implant, a screw passes through the abutment to secure it to an internal thread on the implant (lag-screw). There are variations on this, such as when the abutment and implant body are one piece or when a ''stock'' (prefabricated) abutment is used. Custom abutments can be made by hand, as a cast metal piece or custom milled from metal or zirconia, all of which have similar success rates.&lt;ref name="LindheJ"/&gt;{{rp|page=1233}}

The platform between the implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, the collar of the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as [[platform switching]]. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.&lt;ref name="Atieh2010"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Platform Switching for Marginal Bone Preservation Around Dental Implants: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis |author1=Atieh, M. A. |author2=Ibrahim, H. M. |author3=Atieh, A. H. | journal=Journal of Periodontology | year=2010 | volume=81 | issue=10 | pages=1350–66 | doi=10.1902/jop.2010.100232 | pmid=20575657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the abutment material or technique, an impression of the abutment is then taken and a crown secured to the abutment with dental cement. Another variation on abutment/crown model is when the crown and abutment are one piece and the lag-screw traverses both to secure the one-piece structure to the internal thread on the implant. There does not appear to be any benefit, in terms of success, for cement versus screw-retained prosthetics, although the latter is believed to be easier to maintain (and change when the prosthetic fractures) and the former offers high esthetic performance.&lt;ref name="LindheJ"/&gt;{{rp|page=1233}}

}}
When a removable denture is worn, retainers to hold the denture in place can be either custom made or "off-the-shelf" (stock) abutments. When custom retainers are used, four or more implant fixtures are placed and an impression of the implants is taken and a dental lab creates a custom metal bar with attachments to hold the denture in place. Significant retention can be created with multiple attachments and the use of semi-precision attachments (such as a small diameter pin that pushes through the denture and into the bar) which allows for little or no movement in the denture, but it remains removable.&lt;ref name="Jokstad"/&gt;{{rp|pages=33–34}}  However, the same four implants angled in such a way to distribute occlusal forces may be able to safely hold a fixed denture in place with comparable costs and number of procedures giving the denture wearer a fixed solution.&lt;ref name="Patzelt"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The All-on-Four Treatment Concept: A Systematic Review |author1=Patzelt, S.

Alternatively, stock abutments are used to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style retainer and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention to improve the quality of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures.&lt;ref name="Assuncao"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A comparison of patient satisfaction between treatment with conventional complete dentures and overdentures in the elderly: A literature review |author1=Assunção, W.

===Maintenance===
After placement, implants need to be cleaned (similar to natural teeth) with a Teflon instrument to remove any plaque. Because of the more precarious blood supply to the gingiva, care should be taken with dental floss. Implants will lose bone at a rate similar to natural teeth in the mouth (e.g. if someone suffers from periodontal disease, an implant can be affected by a similar disorder) but will otherwise last. The porcelain on crowns should be expected to discolour, fracture or require repair approximately every ten years, although there is significant variation in the service life of dental crowns based on the position in the mouth, the forces being applied from opposing teeth and the restoration material. Where implants are used to retain a complete denture, depending on the type of attachment, connections need to be changed or refreshed every one to two years.&lt;ref name="Branemark1992"/&gt;{{rp|page=76}}  A powered irrigator may also be useful for  cleaning around implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Susan Wingrove|title=Focus on implant home care Before, during, and after restoration|journal=RDH MAGAZINE|volume=33|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks and complications==

===During surgery===
Placement of dental implants is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and [[necrosis]] of the flap of tissue around the implant.

===First six months===

==== {{anchor|PrimaryStability}} Primary implant stability ====
Primary implant stability refers to the stability of a dental implant immediately after implantation. The stability of the [[titanium]] [[screw]] implant in the patient's [[bone tissue]] post surgery may be non-invasively assessed using [[resonance frequency analysis]]. Sufficient initial stability may allow immediate loading with [[prosthetic]] reconstruction, though early loading poses a higher risk of implant failure than conventional loading.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Yanfei|last2=Zheng|first2=Xinyi|last3=Zeng|first3=Guanqi|last4=Xu|first4=Yi|last5=Qu|first5=Xinhua|last6=Zhu|first6=Min|last7=Lu|first7=Eryi|date=2015-11-06|title=Clinical efficacy of early loading versus conventional loading of dental implants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep15995|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=5|doi=10.1038/srep15995|issn=2045-2322|pmc=4635353|pmid=26542097|page=15995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevance of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant in the first weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability is different from the initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant ([[osseointegration]]). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.

====Immediate post-operative risks====
# Infection (pre-op antibiotics reduce the risk of implant failure by 33 percent but do not affect the risk of infection).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esposito|first=Marco|last2=Worthington|first2=Helen V.|last3=Loli|first3=Vassiliki|last4=Coulthard|first4=Paul|last5=Grusovin|first5=Maria Gabriella|date=2010-07-07|title=Interventions for replacing missing teeth: antibiotics at dental implant placement to prevent complications|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=7|pages=CD004152|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004152.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=20614437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Flap breakdown (less-than 5 percent)&lt;ref name="Branemark1992"/&gt;{{rp|page=68}}

====Failure to integrate====
An implant is tested between 8 and 24 weeks to determine if it is integrated. There is significant variation in the criteria used to determine implant success, the most commonly cited criteria at the implant level are the absence of pain, mobility, infection, gingival bleeding, radiographic lucency or peri-implant bone loss greater than 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="criteria"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Success Criteria in Implant Dentistry: A Systematic Review |author1=Papaspyridakos, P. |author2=Chen, C. - J. |author3=Singh, M. |author4=Weber, H. - P. |author5=Gallucci, G.

Dental implant success is related to operator skill, quality and quantity of the bone available at the site, and the patient's oral hygiene, but the most important factor is [[primary implant stability]].&lt;ref name="Javed"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The role of primary stability for successful immediate loading of dental implants.

Integration failure is rare, particularly if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are followed closely by the patient. Immediate loading implants may have a higher rate of failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.

===Long term===
The long-term complications that result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of the patient and the technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to [[biomechanics|biomechanical factors]], where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor [[crown-to-root ratio]]). Similarly, [[bruxism|grinding of the teeth]], lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.&lt;ref name="Renouard"&gt;{{cite book | title=Risk Factors in Implant Dentistry: Simplified Clinical Analysis for Predictable Treatment | publisher=Quintessence International | author=Renouard, Frank | year=1999 | location=Paris, France | isbn=0867153555}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=27–51}}

From these theoretical risks, derive the real world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to [[peri-implantitis]] or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no [[dental enamel]] on an implant, it does not fail due to [[dental caries|cavities]] like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 93&amp;ndash;98 percent depending on their clinical use.&lt;ref name="main1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="main2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="main3" /&gt; During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to get caught in the gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there does not appear to be any additional [[peri-implantitis]] in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.&lt;ref name="debrandao"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Peri-implant bone loss in cement- and screw-retained prostheses: Systematic review and meta-analysis |author1=De Brandão, M.

In compound implants (two stage implants), between the actual implant and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the oral cavity. Later these bacteria will return into the adjacent tissue and can cause periimplantitis. As prophylaxis these implant interior spaces should be sealed.&lt;ref&gt;Fritzemeier, C. U., W. Schmüdderich: Periimplantitisprophylaxe durch Versiegelung der Implantatinnenräume, Implantologie 2007;15(1):71-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Criteria for the success of the implant supported dental prosthetic varies from study to study, but can be broadly classified into failures due to the implant, soft tissues or prosthetic components or a lack of satisfaction on the part of the patient. The most commonly cited criteria for success are function of at least five years in the absence of pain, mobility, radiographic lucency and  peri-implant bone loss of greater than 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm  on the implant, the lack of suppuration or bleeding in the soft tissues and occurrence of technical complications/prosthetic maintenance, adequate function, and esthetics in the prosthetic. In addition, the patient should ideally be free of pain, [[paraesthesia]], able to chew and taste and be pleased with the esthetics.&lt;ref name="criteria" /&gt;

The rates of complications vary by implant use and prosthetic type and are listed below:

==History==
[[File:Greenfield implant.jpg|thumb|Greenfield's basket: one of the earliest examples of a successful endosseous implant was Greenfield's 1913 implant system]] 
[[File:Branemark's initial radiograph.jpg|thumb|right|While studying bone cells in a rabbit tibia using a titanium chamber, Branemark was unable to remove it from bone. His realization that bone would adhere to titanium led to the concept of osseointegration and the development of modern dental implants. The original x-ray film of the chamber embedded in the rabbit tibia is shown (made available by Branemark).]][[File:Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants.jpg|thumb|Panoramic radiograph of historic dental implants, taken 1978]]

There is archeological evidence that humans have attempted to replace missing teeth with root form implants for thousands of years. Remains from ancient China (dating 4000 years ago) have carved bamboo pegs, tapped into the bone, to replace lost teeth, and 2000-year-old remains from ancient Egypt have similarly shaped pegs made of precious metals. Some Egyptian mummies were found to have transplanted human teeth, and in other instances, teeth made of ivory.&lt;ref name=Misch /&gt;{{rp|page=26}}&lt;ref name=Balaji&gt;{{cite book|last=Balaji|first=S. M.|title=Textbook of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier India|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788131203002|pages=301–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anusavice&gt;{{cite book|last=Anusavice|first=Kenneth J.|title=Phillips' Science of Dental Materials|year=2003|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Missouri|isbn=978-0-7020-2903-5|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilson Popenoe]] and his wife in 1931, at a site in Honduras dating back to 600 AD, found the lower mandible of a young [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] woman, with three missing incisors replaced by pieces of shell, shaped to resemble teeth. Bone growth around two of the implants, and the formation of calculus, indicates that they were functional as well as esthetic. The fragment is currently part of the Osteological Collection of the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] at Harvard University.&lt;ref name=Misch /&gt;&lt;ref name=Balaji /&gt;

The early part of the 20th century saw a number of implants made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the Greenfield implant system of 1913 (also known as the Greenfield crib or basket).&lt;ref name="Greenfield's implant"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenfield|first1=E.J.|title=Implantation of artificial crown and bridge abutments|journal=Dental Cosmos|date=1913|volume=55|pages=364–369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenfield's implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years.&lt;ref name="Greenfield's implant" /&gt; The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who observed how close the bone grew to titanium screws, and the difficulty they had in extracting them.&lt;ref name=Bothe&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bothe|first1=R.T.|last2=Beaton|first2=K.E.|last3=Davenport|first3=H.A.|title=Reaction of bone to multiple metallic implants|journal=Surg Gynecol Obstet|date=1940|volume=71|pages=598–602}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bothe et al. were the first researchers to describe what would later be called osseointegration (a name that would be marketed later on by [[Per-Ingvar Brånemark]]). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leventhal|first1=Gottlieb S.|title=Titanium, a metal for surgery|journal=J Bone Joint Surg Am|date=1951|volume=33-A|issue=2|pages=473–474}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leventhal's positive results led him to believe that titanium represented the ideal metal for surgery.&lt;ref name=Gottlieb /&gt;

In the 1950s research was being conducted at [[Cambridge University]] in England on blood flow in living organisms. These workers devised a method of constructing a chamber of titanium which was then embedded into the [[soft tissue]] of the ears of [[rabbit]]s. In 1952 the Swedish [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopaedic surgeon]], [[Per-Ingvar Brånemark]], was interested in studying bone healing and regeneration. During his research time at [[Lund University]] he adopted the Cambridge designed "rabbit ear chamber" for use in the rabbit femur. Following the study, he attempted to retrieve these expensive chambers from the rabbits and found that he was unable to remove them. Brånemark observed that bone had grown into such close proximity with the titanium that it effectively adhered to the metal. Brånemark carried out further studies into this phenomenon, using both animal and human subjects, which all confirmed this unique property of titanium.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Leonard Linkow]], in the 1950s, was one of the first to insert titanium and other metal implants into the bones of the jaw. Artificial teeth were then attached to these pieces of metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fraunhofer|first1=J.A. von|title=Dental materials at a glance|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118646649|page=115|edition=Second edition.|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I4EskQZWuBEC&amp;pg=PT115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 Brånemark placed his first titanium dental implant into a human volunteer. He began working in the mouth as it was more accessible for continued observations and there was a high rate of [[edentulism|missing teeth]] in the general population offered more subjects for widespread study. He termed the clinically observed adherence of bone with titanium as "osseointegration".&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt;{{rp|page=626}}

Since then implants have evolved into three basic types:
# Root form implants; the most common type of implant indicated for all uses. Within the root form type of implant, there are roughly 18 variants, all made of titanium but with different shapes and surface textures. There is limited evidence showing that implants with relatively smooth surfaces are less prone to peri-implantitis than implants with rougher surfaces and no evidence showing that any particular type of dental implant has superior long-term success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esposito|first=Marco|last2=Ardebili|first2=Yasmin|last3=Worthington|first3=Helen V.|date=2014-07-22|title=Interventions for replacing missing teeth: different types of dental implants|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=7|pages=CD003815|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003815.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25048469}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Zygoma]] implant; a long implant that can anchor to the [[zygoma|cheek bone]] by passing through the [[maxillary sinus]] to retain a complete upper denture when bone is absent. While zygomatic implants offer a novel approach to severe bone loss in the [[maxilla|upper jaw]], it has not been shown to offer any advantage over [[bone grafting]] functionally although it may offer a less invasive option, depending on the size of the reconstruction required.&lt;ref name="Esposito2013a"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Interventions for replacing missing teeth: dental implants in zygomatic bone for the rehabilitation of the severely deficient edentulous maxilla |author1=Esposito, M. |author2=Worthington, H.

# Small diameter implants are implants of low diameter with one piece construction (implant and abutment) that are sometimes used for denture retention or orthodontic anchorage.&lt;ref name=miniimplant /&gt;

A typical implant consists of a [[titanium]] screw (resembling a tooth root) with a roughened or smooth surface. The majority of dental implants are made out of commercially pure titanium, which is available in four grades depending upon the amount of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron contained.&lt;ref&gt;Arturo N. Natali (ed.)  (2003). "Dental Biomechanics". Taylor &amp; Francis, London / New York, 273 pp., {{ISBN|978-0-415-30666-9}}, pp. 69-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Cold work hardened CP4 (maximum impurity limits of N .05 percent, C .10 percent, H .015 percent, Fe .50 percent, and O .40 percent) is the most commonly used titanium for implants. Grade 5 titanium, [[Titanium 6AL-4V]], (signifying the titanium alloy containing 6 percent aluminium and 4 percent vanadium alloy) is slightly harder than CP4 and used in the industry mostly for abutment screws and abutments.&lt;ref name="Ferracane"&gt;{{cite book | title=Materials in Dentistry: Principles and Applications (in English) | publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | author=Ferracane, Jack L. | year=2001 | isbn=9780781727334}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=284–285}} Most modern dental implants also have a textured surface (through etching, [[anodic oxidation]] or [[sandblasting|various-media blasting]]) to increase the surface area and [[osseointegration]] potential of the implant.&lt;ref name="Reza"&gt;{{cite book | title=Nanomaterials and Nanosystems for Biomedical Applications [Mozafari] (in English) | publisher=SpringerLink: Springer e-Books | author=Reza, M | year=2007 | isbn=9781402062896}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=55}}

If C.P. titanium or a titanium alloy has more than 85% titanium content it will form a [[Titanium biocompatibility|titanium biocompatable]] [[titanium oxide]] surface layer or veneer that encloses the other metals preventing them from contacting the bone.&lt;ref name="GuoMatinlinna2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guo|first1=Cecilia Yan|last2=Matinlinna|first2=Jukka Pekka|last3=Tang|first3=Alexander Tin Hong|title=Effects of Surface Charges on Dental Implants: Past, Present, and Future|journal=International Journal of Biomaterials|volume=2012|year=2012|pages=1–5|issn=1687-8787|doi=10.1155/2012/381535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest development in implant technology is [[root analogue dental implant|root analogue ceramic implants]], which are produced from [[CT scan|CT/DVT scans]], milled with modern [[CAD/CAM dentistry|CAD/CAM]] technology, and placed immediately after tooth extraction without any surgery.

== Prices in Europe ==
In Belgium, France, UK or Germany the price of a dental implant with prosthesis is on average 1 400 €. This corresponds to the implant, the abutment and the crown. The prices go from 900€ to 3 500 €&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newdentaire.be/prix-implant-dentaire-pays-europe/|title=Price of dental implant in Europe {{!}} Belgium, France, Hungary|last=Vlaemynck|first=Nicolas|date=28 November 2018|work=NewDentaire|access-date=2018-11-28|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the dentist and the technologies. It is frequent to see patients with 25 000 € quotes for a complete restoration of teeth.

In Europe, the price of a dental implant varies a lot according to the country. The price rate is divided by 3 between the most expensive country and the cheapest country. It is thus possible to save thousands of euros abroad. The price of a complete dental implant with prosthesis is 600 € in Hungary and 450 € on average in Romania.

In [[psychodrama]], '''doubling''' is a technique where a participant, perhaps asked by the psychodrama director, supplements the role (self, [[role reversal]]) of the [[Protagonist#Protagonist in psychodrama|protagonist]], usually by standing behind them and saying things that the protagonist might want to say or is withholding.  The person performing the supplemental role is commonly called the Double. The task of the Double is to provide a link between the patient's internal reality and the external environment.&lt;ref&gt;Hudgins, M. K., &amp; Kiesler, D. J. (1987). Individual experiential psychotheraphy: An analogue validation of the intervention module of psychodramatic doubling. ''Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training'', '''24'''(2), 245-255.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way one is able to hear things that may (or not) reflect what they feel or think.  Thereby, the doubling can help provoke [[abreaction|abreactive]] and mental [[catharsis]], insight, and transformation.  However, newer forms of Doubling focus not so much on an abreactive catharsis but more on an integrative catharsis since psychodrama has learned that too much emotion can be re-traumatizing to the client.

'''Thrive Networks''', also known as '''East Meets West''' is an international [[non-governmental organization]] pioneering evidence-based programs and technologies in health, water and sanitation, and education for underserved populations in Asia and Africa. It was founded in 1988 by author and humanitarian [[Le Ly Hayslip]], and is based in [[Oakland]], [[California]], USA.&lt;ref name="eastmeetswest.org"&gt;[http://www.eastmeetswest.org/Page.aspx?pid=410 About Us]. East Meets West/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

East Meets West declares its mission "to transform health, education and communities of disadvantaged people in Asia by building partnerships, developing opportunities and creating sustainable solutions".&lt;ref name="eastmeetswest.org"/&gt; They believe that every person should have access to clean water, proper medical treatment and decent education, which are estimated as fundamental elements of normal life.

It operates in the fields of healthcare, education, and clean water and sanitation aiming to help people in Asia to achieve self-sufficiency.&lt;ref&gt;''VietNamNet Bridge News''&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the key programs are: providing low-income children with a good education, clean water and vital medical care, [[surgery]] program to heal [[heart]] defects in children (Operation Healthy Heart), scholarship program to improve educational outcomes (SPELL), [[Dentistry|dental]] program, support for children with disabilities, and an innovative clean water and sanitation program.&lt;ref&gt;''Global Partnership on Output Based Aid, GPOBA grants US$3m to East Meets West to improve Access to Water Services to rural Vietnam, November 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amchamvietnam.com/organization/472/detail AmCham Vietnam]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year of 2011, East Meets West invested over $13 million USD on its programs. East Meets West has a four-star rating &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.summary/orgid/5207.htm Charity Navigator Rating]&lt;/ref&gt; and was listed as one of the "10 Charities Expanding in a Hurry" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=topten.detail&amp;listid=11 10 Charities Expanding in a Hurry]&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Charity Navigator]].

In 2014, EMW relaunched in the United States as Thrive Networks. Thrive Networks’ mission is refined to improve the health and well-being of underserved communities in Asia and Africa through evidence-based programs and technologies.

== Programs ==

=== Education programs ===
[[File:SPELL EMW.jpg|thumb|right|230px|EMW SPELL recipients, [[Vietnam]]]]

East Meets West's learning programs provide a comprehensive response to a common development problem, helping children from poor families gain a solid education. The Scholarship Program to Enhance Learning and Literacy (SPELL) program provides 10-year scholarships to children from Vietnam's poorest families. Over 11,000 students now have the opportunity to complete high school and get a good job.

The anti-trafficking ADAPT program, implemented by EMW’s partner Pacific Links Foundation, works to stop trafficking at the source by providing vulnerable girls with the resources they need to create  a brighter future.

The School Construction program builds primary schools and kindergartens in rural areas so more children can attend school. Vietnam does not have enough schools to meet the needs of its population EMW has also helped fill in the gaps in Vietnam's higher education system by building key educational facilities such as university libraries, research centers and sports complexes.

Village of Hope is EMW’s disadvantaged children’s center that provides children from the most difficult circumstances with a safe haven where they receive a full education, job training and skills to help them reintegrate into society.&lt;ref name="eastmeetswest.org/education"&gt;[http://www.eastmeetswest.org/Page.aspx?pid=487 EMW Education Programs].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [http://www.coachforcollege.org/ Coach for College], a program that brings together U.S. and local college students to teach children from rural Vietnam, joined Thrive Networks’ Education portfolio.

=== Healthcare programs ===

[[File:Breathoflife emw.jpg|thumb|upright|220px|EMW Breath of Life program, [[Vietnam]]]]
Through the healthcare programs, EMW provides direct assistance to individuals, supports families, trains medical staff and works to improve systemic capacity by developing and constructing improved medical facilities.

The Breath of Life (BOL) neo-natal health program treats over 50,000 babies a year through appropriate technologies.  BOL provides custom-designed, low-cost equipment to hospitals, and targeted training to medical personnel, to save the lives of infants suffering from common newborn pathologies. To ensure sustainability, BOL works to strengthen linkages with local health authorities to involve them in integrating these technologies into the larger health system. EMW’s neonatal health model was adapted and replicated to serve Laos, Cambodia, Timor Leste in 2008 and more recently in India, Myanmar and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastmeetswest.org/Page.aspx?pid=344 EMW Breath of Life Program]&lt;/ref&gt; BOL formed a major partnership with GE Healthcare in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111117005834/en/GE-Healthcare-Partners-East-Meets-West-Foundation "GE Healthcare Partners with East Meets West Foundation" Business Wire (November 17, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The EMW Dental Program serves 15,000 Vietnamese children annually through its modern dental clinic, school dental trailer and rural outreach project that utilizes portable field equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastmeetswest.org/page.aspx?pid=381 EMW Dental Program]&lt;/ref&gt; The program recently treated its 100,000th patient.

The Operation Healthy Heart program addresses the most common birth defect, [[congenital heart disease]], by providing lifesaving cardiac surgery to critically ill children. In addition, EMW provides training to medical staff in numerous hospitals.

EMW provides a comprehensive support system for the disabled through its Support Network for People with Disabilities (SN-PWD) and its INSPIRE Sports program. Many of these disabilities are caused by exposure to [[Agent Orange]] and [[dioxin]], an issue EMW is addressing through a new campaign of healing for [[Agent Orange]] survivors.

EMW builds key medical institutions that are a crucial link between our grassroots development programs and large-scale capacity building. In the past decade, with major support from the [[Atlantic Philanthropies]], EMW has invested over $50 million in building large-scale hospitals in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="eastmeetswest.org/health"&gt;[http://www.eastmeetswest.org/Page.aspx?pid=488 EMW Medical and Healthcare Programs].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Embrace, an organization founded at Stanford University in 2008 to treat newborns suffering from hypothermia, joins Thrive Networks’ healthcare programs. EMW/Thrive’s health portfolio strategy and scope of work is refined to focus on newborn health.

[[File:Cleanwater EMW.jpg|thumb|right|180px|EMW Clean Water and Sanitation program, [[Vietnam]]]]

=== Clean water and sanitation ===
Through the Clean Water &amp; Sanitation Program, EMW provides a sustainable water supply to communities and ensures that the local people are fully invested in the project. To maximize the health benefits, EMW incorporates a hygiene and sanitation training component to address the need for improved sanitation, another critical public health issue.&lt;ref name="eastmeetswest.org/water"&gt;[http://www.eastmeetswest.org/Page.aspx?pid=399 EMW Clean Water and Sanitation Program].&lt;/ref&gt;

Accountability and results of the EMW water system model are insured by the Output-Based Approach, where funders such as the [[World Bank]]  provide reimbursement for a water system only after its functionality is tested and a requisite number of household connections verified. While most villagers pay for their monthly water usage, the program subsidizes the costs of pipe connections and fees for water delivery to the neediest through its “Poorest of the Poor” program.

The program’s critical sanitation component supports hygiene behavioral change by promoting awareness of practices such as hand washing, installing hand washing stations in schools and building hygienic latrines in communities with existing EMW water systems. Providing better sanitation greatly augments the benefits of the water systems, because lack of sanitation increases the risk of disease, directly jeopardizing the health of the entire community.

To date, EMW has helped finance the construction of 12,500 [[latrines]] in partnership with Watershed Asia and [[USAID]]. Since the Clean Water &amp; Sanitation Program’s inception, EMW has built over 200 water systems and brought improved sanitation to almost 62,500 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastmeetswest.org/page.aspx?pid=399 EMW Clean Water and Sanitation Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

EMW received a US $10.9 million grant from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] to improve sanitation and hygiene practices among the rural poor in [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]].  EMW's program will benefit 1.7 million people in 344,000 households and 290 [[communes]] in Vietnam and Cambodia while working with local organizations, government partners, banks and private enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastmeetswest.org/page.aspx?pid=792 East Meets West to Bring Improved Sanitation and Hygiene Practices to 1.7 million in Vietnam, Cambodia]&lt;/ref&gt; The grant uses a results-based approach to sanitation and hygiene aid, which requires an initial investment from recipient families and communes, and then rewards them when results are achieved.&lt;ref name="bizjournals.com"&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2012/08/gates-foundation-awards-11m-to-east.html "Gates Foundation awards $11M to East Meets West" San Francisco Business Times (August 16, 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [http://blueplanetnetwork.org/ Blue Planet Network] (BPN), an online collaboration and impact analysis platform, merged with EMW’s Water and Sanitation portfolio. Founded in 2002, BPN has a mission to exponentially increase the impact of safe drinking water programs for people worldwide.

== Partners and funders ==
EMW partners with government organizations, international organizations, foundations, local associations, hospitals, and educational institutions to enhance the quality of their programs and expand its scope and impact. Key partnerships include: [[GE Healthcare]], [[Design that Matters]], Blue Planet Network, VNHELP, [[Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs]], [[Osprey Packs]], [[Masimo]], International Children Assistance Network (ICAN), Evidence Action, Design that Matters, MTTS, and Pacific Links.&lt;ref name="eastmeetswest.org/partners"&gt;[http://www.eastmeetswest.org/Page.aspx?pid=609 EMW Partners]&lt;/ref&gt;

EMW receives funding support from government agencies, foundations, corporations and individuals. Key funders include The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], The Global Partnership on Output-based aid, [[USAID]], [[AusAID]], [[Irish Aid]], [[The Atlantic Philanthropies]], [[The Lemelson Foundation]],  [[The Ford Foundation]], [[The Boeing Company]], The [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]],&lt;ref name="eastmeetswest.org/funders"&gt;[http://www.eastmeetswest.org/Page.aspx?pid=626 EMW Funders]&lt;/ref&gt; Wellcome Trust and Dubai Cares.

==Geographic areas served==
Thrive Networks/East Meets West is currently serving communities in nine countries throughout [[Asia|Asia and Africa]], including [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[India]], the [[Philippines]], [[Myanmar]], Afghanistan, Benin and Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastmeetswest.org/Page.aspx?pid=410 East Meets West Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
East Meets West was established by [[Le Ly Hayslip]], whose life story was chronicled in two books she wrote and in [[Oliver Stone]]'s film, ''[[Heaven &amp; Earth (1993 film)|Heaven &amp; Earth]]'', based on her memoir ''[[When Heaven and Earth Changed Places]]''. In 1988, she visited her native village in Ky La in Central Vietnam to begin healing of the war wounds and plant the seeds of reconciliation.

From Le Ly's early projects - Mothers Love Pediatric Clinic and Peace Village Medical Center - East Meets West emerged as a respected [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) in Vietnam, which realized many socially important projects in the country.

In 1993, East Meets West received a grant from [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and constructed the Village of Hope, a shelter and safe haven for 136 needy children from Central Vietnam.

Since 1998 the organization in partnership with [[Atlantic Philanthropies]] has participated in building of Vietnam's medical and educational infrastructure, including university libraries and general hospitals, including a 200-bed [[cardiovascular]] center in [[Huế]] and a twelve-story English Language training center in [[Da Nang]].

In 2003, John Anner left the Independent Press Association to head East Meets West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-12-12/business/17573887_1_ipa-samir-husni-postal-rates "S.F. nonprofit helps small magazines stay alive" SF Gate (December 12, 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, East Meets West co-organized medical equipment donation for [[Viet Duc Hospital]] in [[Hanoi]].

In 2008, EMW began its expansion to [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Timor Leste]], with subsequent programming in the [[Philippines]], [[India]], and [[Myanmar]].

In 2012, the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] awarded East Meets West a US $10.9 million grant to improve sanitation and hygiene practices among the rural poor in Vietnam and Cambodia.&lt;ref name="bizjournals.com"/&gt;

In 2013, EMW and Blue Planet Network signed a definitive agreement to merge, bringing together EMW’s “pay for performance” water and sanitation programs and Blue Planet Network’s online collaboration and impact analysis platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blueplanetnetwork.org/news/bpn_emw_merger.php "East Meets West and Blue Planet Network to Merge" Blue Planet Network News (August 29, 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, EMW relaunched in the United States as Thrive Networks, but continues to operate as East Meets West in Asia'''.''' Thrive Networks adopts a new nonprofit business model: using mergers and shared ventures to increase impact.

In 2015, after 13 years with EMW/Thrive Networks, John Anner stepped down as CEO. The organization welcomed a new management team that is committed to evidence-based impact and strategic focus.

In 2016, EMW Vietnam welcomed new Country Director, Loan Duong. Thrive Networks renews its focus on conducting and commissioning rigorous evaluations and impact research.

Decidual cells found outside inner lining of the uterus are called '''ectopic decidual cells''' or '''ectopic decidua'''. This condition was first described in 1971 by Walker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolat|first1=Filiz|title=Pregnancy related peritoneal ectopic decidua: Morphological and clinical evaluation|journal=Turkish Journal of Pathology|date=2012|volume=28|issue=1|pages=56–60|doi=10.5146/tjpath.2012.01098|pmid=22207433|ref=tjp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name 'ectopic decidua' was coined by Tausig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ober|first1=William|title=Ectopic ovarian decidua without pregnancy|journal=American Journal of Pathology|date=1957|volume=33|issue=2|pages=199–217|pmc=1934629|pmid=13402883}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ectopic decidua is most commonly seen during [[pregnancy]], it rarely occurs in non-pregnant women, accompanied by bleeding and pain.

Generally, ectopic decidua has no clinical symptoms, but it sometimes manifests as abdominal pain in pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balta|first1=Anita|title=Deciduosis of the Appendix Manifesting as Acute Abdomen in Pregnancy|journal=Acta Chirurgica Latviensis|volume=14|date=2014|issue=1|pages=43–45|doi=10.2478/chilat-2014-0110|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/chilat.2014.14.issue-1/chilat-2014-0110/chilat-2014-0110.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ectopic decidua most commonly occurs the [[ovary]], [[cervix]] and [[serosa]]l lining of the uterus. It rarely occurs in [[peritoneum]] also. In the peritoneum, ectopic decidua is formed due to metaplasia of subserosal stromal cells under the influence of progesterone. It regresses within 4–6 weeks after childbirth. Therefore, no treatment is needed for this condition. However, it is necessary to differentiate deciduosis from metastatic cancers and [[mesothelioma]].

'''Elixir sulfanilamide''' was an improperly prepared [[sulfanilamide]] medicine that caused mass [[poison]]ing in the United States in 1937. It caused the deaths of more than 100 people. The public outcry caused by this incident and other similar disasters led to the passing of the 1938 [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SulfanilamideDisaster/default.htm The 1937 Elixir Sulfanilamide Incident&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Medicine: Post-Mortem |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758704,00.html |quote=Then, two months ago, fatality knocked at its door. A new mixture of a new drug (sulfanilamide) with a new solvent (diethylene glycol), which Dr. Massengill's salesmen sold as Elixir Sulfanilamide-Massengill, was discovered to be killing its users |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=December 20, 1937 |accessdate=2009-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Aside from the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906 and the [[Harrison Act]] of 1914 banning the sale of some narcotic drugs, there was no federal regulatory control in the United States of America ensuring the safety of new drugs until Congress enacted the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in response to the elixir sulfanilamide poisoning crisis.

In 1937, [[S. E. Massengill Company]], a pharmaceutical manufacturer, created a preparation of [[sulfanilamide]] using [[diethylene glycol]] (DEG) as a [[solvent]], and called the preparation "Elixir Sulfanilamide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Wallace Reveals How Federal Agents Traced Elixir to Halt Fatalities |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/11/26/archives/death-drug-hunt-covered-15-states-wallace-reveals-how-federal.html |quote=A graphic story of a race against death from "elixir sulfanilamide," carried on by the Food and Drug Administration in fifteen States from Virginia to California, a race not won until ninety-three persons had died after taking the lethal dose, was told by Secretary Wallace today in a report responding to Senate and House resolutions. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 26, 1937 |accessdate=2009-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DEG is poisonous to humans and other mammals, but Harold Watkins, the company's chief pharmacist and chemist, was not aware of this. (Though the first case of a fatality from ethylene glycol occurred in 1930 and studies had been published in medical journals stating DEG could cause kidney damage or failure, its toxicity was not widely known prior to the incident.)&lt;ref name=FDA /&gt;&lt;ref name="The clinical toxicology laboratory"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Leslie M.|title=The clinical toxicology laboratory : contemporary practice of poisoning evaluation|year=2001|publisher=AACC Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-890883-53-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXvFGqz44pYC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=ethylene+glycol+toxicity+1930&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T0wT4wUAmp&amp;sig=KwlnK_oWMJuwtUjMB05KM5lcrvc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4GqQULL4BsHaqgHN7YG4BQ&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ethylene%20glycol%20toxicity%201930&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Watkins simply added raspberry flavoring to the sulfa drug which he had dissolved in DEG and the company then marketed the product. [[Animal testing]] was not required by law, and Massengill performed none; there were no regulations requiring premarket safety testing of new drugs.

The company started selling and distributing the medication in September 1937. By October 11, the [[American Medical Association]] received a report of several deaths caused by the medication. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] was notified, and an extensive search was conducted to recover the distributed medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Daniel|title=Reputation and Power: Organizational Image and Pharmaceutical Regulation at the FDA|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0-691-14180-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] assisted on a research project that verified that the [[excipient]] DEG was responsible for the fatal [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]]. At least 100 deaths were blamed on the medication.

The owner of the company, when pressed to admit some measure of culpability, infamously answered, "We have been supplying a legitimate professional demand and not once could have foreseen the unlooked-for results. I do not feel that there was any responsibility on our part."&lt;ref name=mihm&gt;{{cite web

A woman wrote to U.S. President Roosevelt and described the death of her daughter:
"The first time I ever had occasion to call in a doctor for [Joan] and she was given Elixir of Sulfanilamide. All that is left to us is the caring for her little grave. Even the memory of her is mixed with sorrow for we can see her little body tossing to and fro and hear that little voice screaming with pain and it seems as though it would drive me insane. ... It is my plea that you will take steps to prevent such sales of drugs that will take little lives and leave such suffering behind and such a bleak outlook on the future as I have tonight."

Congress responded to public outrage by passing the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which required companies to perform animal safety tests on their proposed new drugs and submit the data to the FDA before being allowed to market their products.  The Massengill Company paid a minimum fine under provisions of the 1906 Pure Food and Drugs Act, which prohibited labeling the preparation an "[[elixir]]" if it had no alcohol in it.

Childhood obesity in the United States, has been a serious problem among children and adolescents, and can cause serious health problems among our youth. As of 2015-2016, in the United States, 18.5% of children and adolescents have obesity, which affects approximately 13.7 million children and adolescents.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/childhood.html|title=Childhood Obesity Facts  {{!}} Overweight &amp; Obesity {{!}} CDC|date=2018-08-14|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prevalence has remained high over the past three decades across most age, sex, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, and represents a three-fold increase from one generation ago and is expected to continue rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1097/med.0b013e3283423de1| pmid=21157323|title = Pediatric obesity epidemiology| journal=Current Opinion in Endocrinology, Diabetes and Obesity| volume=18| issue=1| pages=14–22|year = 2011|last1 = Orsi|first1 = Carisse M.| last2=Hale| first2=Daniel E.| last3=Lynch| first3=Jane L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/164/7/598 | doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.84| pmid=20603458| title=Changes in State-Specific Childhood Obesity and Overweight Prevalence in the United States from 2003 to 2007| journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine| volume=164| issue=7| pages=598–607| year=2010| last1=Singh| first1=Gopal K.| last2=Kogan| first2=Michael D.| last3=Van Dyck| first3=Peter C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevalence of pediatric obesity also varies with state.

From 2003-2007, there was a twofold increase in states reporting prevalence of pediatric obesity greater than or equal to 18%.7 Oregon was the only state showing decline from 2003 to 2007 (decline by 32%), and using children in Oregon as a [[reference group]], obesity in children in [[Illinois]], [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Kansas]] has doubled.&lt;ref name="archpedi.ama-assn.org" /&gt;
	
The likelihood of obesity in children was found to increase significantly with decreasing levels of [[household income]], lower neighborhood access to parks or sidewalks, increased [[television]] viewing time, and increased recreational [[computer]] time.&lt;ref&gt;Obesity and overweight for professionals: Childhood: Basics | DNPAO | CDC [cited 11/26/2011 2011].

Available from https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/basics.html (accessed November 26, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevalence ===
For the 2015–2016 year, the CDC found that the prevalence of obesity for children aged 2-19 years old, in the U.S., was 18.5%. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The current trends show that children aged 12-19 years old, have obesity levels 2.2% higher than children 6-11 years old (20.6% vs. 18.4%), and children 6-11 years old have obesity levels 4.5% higher than children aged 2-5 years old (18.4% vs. 13.9%). Boys, 6-19 years old, have a 6.1% higher prevalence of obesity, than boys aged 2-5 years old (20.4% vs. 14.3%). While girls aged 12-19 years old, have a 7.4% greater prevalence of obesity, than girls aged 2-5 years old (20.9% vs. 13.5%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2010 NCHS Data Brief published by the CDC found interesting trends in prevalence of childhood obesity.&lt;ref name="Ogden, C. L 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 21211166|year = 2010|last1 = Ogden|first1 = C. L.|title = Obesity and socioeconomic status in children and adolescents: United States, 2005-2008|journal = Nchs Data Brief|issue = 51|pages = 1–8|last2 = Lamb|first2 = M. M.|last3 = Carroll|first3 = M. D.|last4 = Flegal|first4 = K. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of obesity among boys from households with an income at or above 350% the [[poverty level]] was found to be 11.9%, while boys with a household income level at or above 130% of the poverty level was 21.1%.&lt;ref name="Ogden, C. L 2010" /&gt; The same trend followed in girls. Girls with a household income at or above 350% of the poverty level has an obesity prevalence of 12.0%, while girls with a household income 130% below the poverty level had a 19.3% prevalence.&lt;ref name="Ogden, C. L 2010" /&gt;

These trends were not consistent when stratified according to race. “The relationship between income and obesity prevalence is significant among non-Hispanic white boys; 10.2% of those living in households with income at or above 350% of the poverty level are obese compared with 20.7% of those in households below 130% of the poverty level.”&lt;ref name="Ogden, C. L 2010" /&gt; The same trend follows in non-Hispanic white girls (10.6% of those living at or above 350% of the poverty level are obese, and 18.3% of those living below 130% of the poverty level are obese)&lt;ref name="Ogden, C. L 2010" /&gt;

There is no significant trend in prevalence by income level for either boys or girls among non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American children and adolescents.&lt;ref name="Ogden, C. L 2010" /&gt; “In fact, the relationship does not appear to be consistent; among [[Mexican-American]] girls, although the difference is not significant, 21.0% of those living at or above 350% of the poverty level are obese compared with 16.2% of those living below 130% of the poverty level.” &lt;ref name="Ogden, C. L 2010" /&gt;

Additional findings also include that the majority of children and adolescents are not low income children.&lt;ref name="Ogden, C. L 2010" /&gt; The majority of non-Hispanic white children and adolescents also live in households with income levels at or above 130% of the poverty level.&lt;ref name="Ogden, C. L 2010" /&gt; Approximately 7.5 million children live in households with income levels above 130% of the poverty level compared to 4.5 million children in households with income at or above 130% of the poverty level.&lt;ref name="Ogden, C. L 2010" /&gt;

=== Incidence ===
The importance of identifying the incidence of age-related onset of obesity is vital to understanding when intervention opportunities are most important. Similarly, identifying the incidence of childhood obesity within a respective race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, can also help delineate other areas of intervention opportunities for certain populations. A systematic review on the incidence of childhood obesity, found that childhood obesity in the U.S. declines with age.&lt;ref name="Cheung"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheung|first=PC|last2=Cunningham|first2=SA|last3=Narayan|first3=KM Venkat|last4=Kramer|first4=MR|date=2016|title=Childhood Obesity Incidence in the United States: A Systematic Review|journal=Childhood Obesity (Print)|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1089/chi.2015.0055|issn=2153-2176|pmc=4753627|pmid=26618249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age-and-sex related incidence of obesity was found to be "4.0% for infants 0–1.9 years, 4.0% for preschool-aged children 2.0–4.9 years, 3.2% for school-aged children 5.0–12.9 years, and 1.8% for adolescents 13.0–18.0 years." When the incidence of childhood obesity, was isolated for the socioeconomically disadvantaged, or for racial/ethnic minority groups, obesity incidence was discovered to be, "4.0% at ages 0–1.9 years, 4.1% at 2.0–4.9 years, 4.4% at 5.0–12.9 years, and 2.2% at 13.0–18.0 years." &lt;ref name=Cheung /&gt;

Based on a 2015-2016 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), researchers at Duke University, found that the incidence of childhood obesity is on the rise, with a notable rise in preschool boys (2.0-4.9 years), and girls aged 16.0-19.0 years old.  The Duke University researchers also discovered that although it had been believed that obesity in children had been on a decline in recent years, obesity in children at all ages has actually been increasing.&lt;ref name=FBNews&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/11368-incidence-of-childhood-obesity-continues-to-rise|title=Incidence of childhood obesity continues to rise|access-date=2018-10-30|website=Food Business News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Episcleritis''' is a benign, self-limiting [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[disease]] affecting part of the [[human eye|eye]] called the [[episclera]].  The episclera is a thin layer of tissue that lies between the [[conjunctiva]] and the connective tissue layer that forms the white of the eye ([[sclera]]).  Episcleritis is a common condition, and is characterized by the abrupt onset of painless eye [[Hyperaemia|redness]].

There are two types of episcleritis, nodular and simple.  Nodular episcleritis lesions have raised surface. Simple episcleritis lesions are flat. There are two subtypes. In diffuse simple episcleritis, inflammation is generalized. In sectoral simple episcleritis, the inflammation is restricted to one region.

Most cases of episcleritis have no identifiable cause, although a small fraction of cases is associated with various systemic diseases.  Often people with episcleritis experience it recurrently.  Treatment focuses on decreasing discomfort, and includes lubricating eye drops. More severe cases may be treated with topical corticosteroids or oral anti-inflammatory medications ([[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]]).

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[File:Episcleritis.jpg|thumb|Episcleritis of a 40 years old female]]
Symptoms of episcleritis typically include painless redness of the eye (mild pain is possible but atypical), and [[watery eyes]].&lt;ref name=EpiscleraScleraConj&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heath |first=Greg |title=The episclera, sclera and conjunctiva An overview of relevant ocular anatomy |journal=OT |date=10 February 2010 |url=http://www.optometry.co.uk/uploads/articles/2968dcb27c990328d028d328b5c649b5_CETheath-10206.pdf |pages=36–42 |accessdate=30 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513025206/http://www.optometry.co.uk/uploads/articles/2968dcb27c990328d028d328b5c649b5_CETheath-10206.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pain of episcleritis is typically mild, less severe than in [[scleritis]],&lt;ref name=Cecil&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Lee |title=Goldman's Cecil Medicine |publisher=Elsevier Saunders |location=Philadelphia |isbn=1437727883 |year=2011 |pages=2440 |edition=24th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be tender to palpation.&lt;ref name=ColorAtlasFamily&gt;{{cite book |author=Chumley H. |author2=Usatine RP |author3=Smith MA |author4=Chumley H |author5=Mayeaux, Jr. E |author6=Tysinger J |title=The Color Atlas of Family Medicine: Chapter 16.

There are two types of episcleritis: the diffuse type, where the redness involves the entire episclera, and the nodular type, where the redness appears more [[Nodule (medicine)|nodular]], involving only a small, well-circumscribed area ([[Circular sector|sectoral]]).&lt;ref name=WillsEye4th /&gt;  The diffuse type of episcleritis may be less painful than the nodular type.  Sometimes, small nodules are present within the episclera, which move slightly over the sclera with gentle pressure.&lt;ref name=WillsEye4th /&gt;

Discharge is absent with episcleritis, and vision is unaffected.&lt;ref name=WillsEye4th&gt;{{cite book |last=Kunimoto |first=Derek |author2=Kunal Kanitkar |author3=Mary Makar |title=The Wills eye manual: office and emergency room diagnosis and treatment of eye disease. |year=2004 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0781742078 |pages=99–100 |edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patients with episcleritis experience far less [[photophobia]] than patients with [[uveitis]].&lt;ref name=EpiscleraScleraConj /&gt;  Episcleritis does not cause the presence of cells or flare in the anterior chamber of the eye.&lt;ref name=EpiscleraScleraConj /&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Most of the time, the cause of episcleritis is never determined ([[idiopathic]]).  An identifiable cause ''is'' discovered in about one third of cases.&lt;ref name=Yanoff&gt;{{cite book |last=Yanoff |first=Myron |author2=Jay S. Duker |title=Ophthalmology |year=2008 |publisher=Mosby |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0323057516 |pages=255–261 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several diseases are associated with episcleritis, including systemic vasculitic diseases ([[polyarteritis nodosa]], [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]]), connective tissue diseases ([[rheumatoid arthritis]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Watson |first=PG |author2=Hayreh, SS |title=Scleritis and episcleritis. |journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology |date=March 1976 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=163–91 |pmid=1268179 |doi=10.1136/bjo.60.3.163 |pmc=1042706}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[rosacea]], [[atopy]],&lt;ref name=Yanoff /&gt; [[gout]],&lt;ref name=WillsEye4th /&gt; and [[ulcerative colitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Langholz |first=E. |title=Review: Current trends in inflammatory bowel disease: the natural history |journal=Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology |date=March 2010 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=77–86 |doi=10.1177/1756283X10361304 |pmid=21180592 |pmc=3002570}}&lt;/ref&gt;  59 percent of patients with [[relapsing polychondritis]] have either episcleritis or scleritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sabatine |first=Marc S. |title=Pocket Medicine |year=2011 |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |isbn=1608319059 |page=8-4 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely, episcleritis may be caused by [[scleritis]].&lt;ref name=Medline&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001019.htm |title=Episcleritis: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia |publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |accessdate=20 June 2010 |location=Bethesda, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redness in the eye associated with episcleritis is due to engorgement of the large episcleral blood vessels, which run in a radial direction from the [[Corneal limbus|limbus]].&lt;ref name=WillsEye4th /&gt;  Typically, there is no uveitis, or thickening of the sclera.

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of episcleritis is based upon the history and physical examination.  The history should be explored for the presence of the diseases associated with episcleritis, and the symptoms they cause, such as rash, arthritis, venereal disease, and recent viral infection.&lt;ref name=WillsEye4th /&gt;  Episcleritis may be differentiated from scleritis by using [[phenylephrine]] or [[neosynephrine]] eye drops, which causes blanching of the blood vessels in episcleritis, but not in scleritis.&lt;ref name=Cecil /&gt;  A blue color to the sclera suggests scleritis, rather than episcleritis.

After anesthetizing the eye with medication, the conjunctiva may be moved with a cotton swab to observe the location of the enlarged blood vessels.

== Treatment ==
Often, treatment is not necessary, because episcleritis is a self-limiting condition.  [[Artificial tears]] may be used to help with irritation and discomfort.  More severe cases can be treated with either topical [[corticosteroid]]s or oral [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]].&lt;ref name=Yanoff /&gt;

[[Ketorolac]], a topical NSAID, may be used, but it is not more effective than artificial tears and it causes more side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=CP |author2=Browning, AC |author3=Sleep, TJ |author4=Webber, SK |author5=McGill, JI |title=A randomised, double-blind trial of topical ketorolac vs artificial tears for the treatment of episcleritis. |journal=Eye (London, England) |date=July 2005 |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=739–42 |pmid=15359265 |doi=10.1038/sj.eye.6701632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eric Northman''' is a [[fictional character]] in ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries]],'' a series of thirteen books written by ''New York Times'' bestselling author [[Charlaine Harris]].  He is a vampire, slightly over one thousand years old, and is first introduced in the first novel, ''[[Dead Until Dark]]'' and appears in all subsequent novels. Since the book series is told from the first person perspective of Sookie Stackhouse, what readers perceive of his character is influenced by what Sookie comprehends. [[HBO]]'s television series ''[[True Blood]]'' is based on this book series and the character of Eric Northman is portrayed somewhat differently. A [[List of True Blood characters|list of ''True Blood'' characters]] has a detailed description of Eric's character from the TV show.

== Human life ==
In the early books, little was revealed about his past. In the ninth book, ''[[Dead and Gone (novel)|Dead and Gone]]'' Eric revealed details about his human life as a [[Viking]]. He was deemed a man at the age of twelve. At sixteen he married Aude, his brother's widow. The couple had six children, but only three were living at the time of his turning, two boys and a girl. Aude and their sixth child died of a fever shortly after the birth when Eric was in his early twenties. It is revealed in the television series that the vampire king of Mississippi murdered his entire family before stealing his father's Viking crown. In the books, he was ambushed one night by a Roman vampire named [[List of The Southern Vampire Mysteries characters#Appius Livius Ocella|Appius Livius Ocella]] and subsequently turned. In the television series, he was made a vampire by Godric.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0112201/bio|title=Eric Northman (Character)|website=IMDb|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the television show, it is also shown that Eric was a Viking prince, in the novels Eric says that his father was a chief. The name "Eric" or "Erik" comes from Old Norse and means "One ruler" or "eternal ruler". The name "Norseman" was the name given to people who could speak the Old Norse Language, especially in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. The name "Norseman" means "man from the north", hence Eric's last name being "Northman".

== Physical description and personality ==

In the first novel, ''[[Dead Until Dark]]'', [[Sookie Stackhouse]] thinks Eric Northman is a "hunk." Sookie describes him as ''“handsome, in fact, radiant; blond and blue-eyed, tall and broad shouldered. He was wearing boots, jeans, and a vest. Period. Kind of like the guys on the cover of romance books".''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dead Until Dark]]'' Charlaine Harris&lt;/ref&gt; He’s approximately six-foot-four. When Sookie sees him naked for the first time in ''[[Dead to the World (novel)|Dead to the World]],'' she thinks, “if there were an international butt competition, Eric would win, hands down – or cheeks up.”&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dead to the World (novel)]]'' Charlaine Harris&lt;/ref&gt;
In the TV series 'True Blood' he is tall with long blonde hair. By the end of the first season, and a little bit into the second, Pam (his progeny) cuts his hair shorter than expected because he gets blood in it. Eric is always shown in dark blue jeans with a black singlet and a black leather jacket. When his hair is cut shorter, he parts it and combs it diagonally backwards. His personality in the series is mostly the same, Eric Northman is ruthless and does not care much for human life. His relationship with his progeny, Pam, is where you see this softer side of him come through. When they face difficult challenges and situations, Eric would put her needs above his own. By the middle of season 2 Eric begins to pursue Sookie Stackhouse because of his interest in her abilities, and by the end of season 2 Eric Northman has cunningly tricked her into drinking his blood. Near the beginning of the third season, it is implied that he is beginning to develop feelings for her, even helping her when it is disadvantageous for him to do so. 

Eric is portrayed in the books as being somewhat arrogant, but having a true [[joie de vivre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is confident almost to a fault, once reprimanding a thug in the third book, ''[[Club Dead]]'', for threatening Sookie and referring to her as his "future lover" although no potentially romantic relationship  between Eric and Sookie yet existed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Club Dead|''Club Dead'', Charlaine Harris]]&lt;/ref&gt; He can be manipulative to suit his needs. He is not above using deceit though it seems to be a last resort when it comes to Sookie. However, he is typically upfront regarding any action he takes and if he is manipulative he is very frank and open regarding his wishes. Due to his frank nature, Sookie comments to herself how she can always know where she stands with Eric.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dead in the Family|''Dead in the Family'', Charlaine Harris]]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Sookie frequently remarks how conversations with Eric are seldom single layered and how he never says something without reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[From Dead to Worse|''From Dead to Worse'', Charlaine Harris]]&lt;/ref&gt; He is not sentimental in the least but shows a great deal of concern over Sookie and her happiness and well-being, perhaps making the relationship between Eric and Sookie all the more impressive.
Sookie believes that, although Eric has created a modest, but thriving business empire and carved out a position of authority in the delicate vampire hierarchy, at heart he remains a born-Viking warrior, ready to leap into battle at any instant.

== Work and position within the vampire hierarchy ==

The vampires in Charlaine Harris' world are organized according to a [[Feudalism|feudal]] system with each state divided into "Areas", each of which are governed by a sheriff who then owes allegiance to the queen or king of that particular state. Some states, like California, are so large and so heavily populated with humans (and therefore vampires who prey on humans) they are divided into multiple kingdoms. For example, what humans see as California, vampires see as California Sacramento, California San Jose, and California Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dead in the Family]], Charlaine Harris&lt;/ref&gt; Louisiana is not such a state and is ruled by one monarch. However, it is possible for a monarch to control multiple states. At one point in the series Louisiana is controlled by the same vampire who also controlled Arkansas. Later in the series a different ruler controls Louisiana, Arkansas, and Nevada.

Eric is the most powerful vampire in Area Five of northern Louisiana: a territory that includes the small town of Bon Temps.  Eric serves as Sheriff of area 5, or local boss, of that area and owns a vampire bar in Shreveport called "Fangtasia," that also serves as his headquarters. He runs the bar with the help of his vampire progeny [[Pam (vampire)|Pam]] and a few of his underlings, or vampires who owe allegiance to Eric as their sheriff. Eric takes his responsibilities and role within the vampire hierarchy very seriously.  In the sixth novel, ''[[Definitely Dead]]'', Eric mentions that he has paid a significant fine to the arbitrator for killing a former Fangtasia bartender, Long Shadow. This demonstrates that he did not hide his crime, as killing another vampire is a "serious thing.".&lt;ref&gt;[[Definitely Dead]], Harris, Charlaine&lt;/ref&gt; Precisely what a Vampire Sheriff does, aside from owe allegiance to their monarch, do their monarch's bidding, and rule their Area, is still somewhat unclear. Sookie makes a conscious effort not to pry too hard into vampire affairs and Eric does nothing to encourage her learning much more than she already knows. Eric surprised Sookie in the tenth book, ''[[Dead in the Family]]'', when he explained the vampire hierarchy in more detail, simply so she, as his wife according to vampire law, was better informed for her safety.

The state of Louisiana was in disarray after the results of [[Hurricane Katrina]], and after [[Sophie-Anne Leclerq|queen of Louisiana]], Eric's hierarch, was crippled in an explosion and eventually killed by the vampires of Nevada under [[Characters of The Southern Vampire Mysteries#Felipe de Castro|Felipe de Castro]]'s order. Eric was spared since he was the most practical of the Sheriffs and had one of the largest money makers, [[Bill Compton (The Southern Vampire Mysteries)|Bill Compton]], living in his area and owing fealty to him. As the last surviving sheriff of Louisiana, Eric pledges his allegiance to the new regime in order to protect those under him, a tactical move that highlights his capabilities both as a leader and a political survivor. Had Eric resisted, he and all of the vampires serving under him (possibly with the exception of Bill) would have been killed, including Sookie.  After accepting the new King, Felipe de Castro, he is then allowed to maintain control of his area and his followers when the other sheriffs of Louisiana and a number of their minions were all killed. Under the new regime, Eric has spent a significant amount of time acclimating himself to his new overlords. Despite his oath, however, Eric remains ever vigilant for opportunities to either further secure his position or free himself entirely from scrutiny of Felipe's Louisiana representative, Victor.

== Relationship with Sookie Stackhouse ==
The author introduces Sookie to Eric in her first novel, ''[[Dead Until Dark]]''.  Eric then appears in all the subsequent novels and has either saved or attempted to save Sookie's life in every book. From the second book onward, Eric and Sookie share at least one intimate moment together per book. In the second one there are several: when he asks her to suck out a bullet in his chest that he took for her, and when Sookie invites him to an orgy they have to play the part; in the third, they almost have sex before being interrupted by Bubba and also when he gives her blood after she is staked; the fourth, they experience a sexual relationship when he is cursed with amnesia, which he forgets all about promptly after being un-cursed; the fifth, they kiss; the sixth, during battle Eric sneaks a kiss on Sookie after saving her; the seventh, they exchange blood tying them to each other in a blood bond and Eric kisses her; the eighth, they kiss again after Eric smells fairy blood all over Sookie; and in the ninth, they consummate their relationship after being wed by vampire laws and seem to be moving in the direction of an official relationship. In the later books, she has also saved his life several times before.

After appearing to develop an affection for Sookie in the third book in the series, ''[[Club Dead]]'', Eric has a brief romance with her in ''[[Dead to the World (novel)|Dead to the World]]'', the fourth book, though, due to a curse, he lost his memories of that time until ''[[From Dead to Worse]]'', the eighth book. In the eighth book, after sitting in Sookie's room, he reveals that he remembers the days he spent with her when the curse was put on him. He asks her to discuss it, and she refuses. He seemingly likes [[Bill Compton (vampire)|Bill Compton]] but feels arrogantly competitive in an emotional battle for Sookie's affections.

In the seventh book, ''[[All Together Dead]]'', when Sookie is accosted into forming a blood bond with Andre, another powerful vampire, Eric steps in opportunistically as the lesser of two evils and bonds with her himself. A blood bond is formed when a human and vampire exchange blood by drinking it from them. Vampire blood can heal any human wounds within seconds as can human blood do the same for vampires.

In ''[[Dead and Gone (novel)|Dead and Gone]]'', Eric sends Sookie a velvet parcel that he instructs her to give to him in front of King Felipe de Castro's representative, Victor Madden.  Without looking inside the parcel first, Sookie presents Eric the bag which contains a ceremonial knife that is used in marriage ceremonies. The king's representative reveals that the act of giving and receiving the knife means that Eric and Sookie are pledged to one another. Eric claims that he deceived Sookie because the King of Nevada had the power and desire to take her away from her home.  Because they are wed, Eric is the only vampire that can have access to Sookie on pain of final death. He also reveals that the curse that had been placed on him made him unconsciously seek out the presence of his heart's desire (Sookie). In "[[Dead in the Family]]" Eric and Sookie are in an actual relationship, and Eric admits that he sees Sookie as his wife in the only way that matters to him, which left her puzzled.

In the 12th Sookie Stackhouse novel, ''[[Deadlocked (novel)|Deadlocked]]'', Sookie and Eric's relationship takes a turn. Eric was promised by his maker, Appius, to marry the Queen of Oklahoma, and he has spent much of his time figuring out how to get out of the promise. Sookie wants Eric to choose her outright and Eric explains that he just can't ignore a command from his maker even though he is dead. They do not see each other too much in the book; Eric does tell Sookie that she has the power to make him stay, which she finds out near the end of the book that he knows about her cluviel dor which will grant her one wish. She ends up using it at the end of the book to save [[Sam Merlotte]]'s life and Eric just walks away after he sees this. The book ends with them basically in the same spot, not knowing if Eric is going to marry the Queen of Oklahoma or stay with Sookie.

In the 13th Sookie Stackhouse novel, ''[[Dead Ever After]]'', Eric and Sookie's relationship has crashed and burned. Eric is set to officially marry Freyda, the Queen of Oklahoma, and he has been banned from ever seeing Sookie again. Also, Sookie has been banned from Fangtasia and Oklahoma. In one of the last conversations Eric and Sookie have, he tells her that he was considering making her a vampire even though she never wanted to become one. By the end of the novel, Eric is in Oklahoma with his new wife and without either of his progeny.

== Television portrayal ==
In ''[[True Blood]]'', an HBO series based on the earliest books in the series, the character of Eric Northman is played by Swedish actor [[Alexander Skarsgård]]. Some details of the character are portrayed somewhat differently on ''[[True Blood]]'' than in the books. In the series, Eric is created by [[Characters of True Blood#Godric|Godric]], with whom he shares a deep bond of loyalty and devotion. In season 2 Godric commits suicide by exposing himself to sunlight, causing Eric to shed bloody vampire tears, however, in the novels he cries for the first time in book 9. In the series, Bill, rather than Eric, saves Sookie from Long Shadow (in the books Eric kills him). Eric has not demonstrated the outward concern for Sookie that he exhibited in the early novels, but he appears to be developing an uneasy, guarded affection for her and the series seems to portray a reluctance on his part to show people, particularly Sookie, his genuine emotions. Often Eric has presented himself to Sookie as violent, arrogant, mischievous and consciously manipulative. Thus far in the series he has usually acted in a manner with little apparent concern for Sookie's feelings or immediate safety, although ultimately he seems to protect her.

However, his growing feelings for Sookie are showcased in episode 4 of Season 3 when he daydreams about Sookie. After the daydream he spurns Yvetta and Pam looks on at him concerned. In episode 10, Eric kissed Sookie, after proclaiming that if he were to die a true death without having at least kissed her, that would be his greatest regret. He chained her up in his basement a few minutes later as bait for Russell. He again reveals his guarded affection for her when prompted by Russell to drink her blood, he hesitates and strokes her affectionately on the cheek. Finally, in the season three finale, he tells her that he regrets seeing her in such pain, referring to her heartbreak over ending her relationship with Bill- although he was the one who deliberately gave her the information that caused her to banish Bill from her house.

Eric's back story is more deeply explored in Season 3, as his youth and human life as a Viking prince was shown; his family was slaughtered in their castle by a pack of werewolves, under the command of the ancient vampire Russell Edgington.  Eric gave his dying father a vow to avenge them all.  During World War II, he and Godric were shown tracking Russell's wolfpack across Germany disguised as SS officers, though they never found Russell himself.

In Season 3, when Eric defects to Russell Edginton (now the King of Mississippi) instead of Queen Sophie-Anne in an effort to save Pam from torture by the Magister, he notices a crown in Russell's antique collection that he recognizes as his father's, stolen the night of the attack. Realizing Russell is the target he has sought for over 1,000 years, he continues to play up his loyalty to Russell to keep him from becoming suspicious, even displaying callous indifference to Sookie when she is captured and asks for help.  However, later on, when Russell is attacking Bill and Sookie with his wolves, Eric murders his progeny and husband Talbot; Russell, sensing Talbot's death, is driven insane by grief and rage.  He hunts down Eric and prepares to kill him until Eric reveals that he can show Russell how to daywalk, Russell's oldest obsession.  After consuming much of Sookie's blood against her will (which visibly discomforts Eric) they are indeed able to daywalk, but it wears off very quickly; Eric cuffs Russell to himself with silver, intending for both of them to burn.  Sookie brings Eric back inside and, at the request of Eric, retrieves the badly-injured Russell as well.  Eric only spared Russell because he thought death would be too merciful for him; after knocking out one of his fangs, he buried the crippled vampire in silver chains and wet concrete, intending to let him starve in agony for 100 years but never die.

In Season 4, we see the relationship of Sookie and Eric develop after he loses his memory to the witch coven; first, Sookie shelters him in her house from Bill (though the house is technically Eric's).  Endeared by the new Eric's innocence and his regret over his previous crimes as a vampire, Sookie eventually enters a sexual relationship with him, though in the Season 4 finale, Sookie is choosing between Eric and Bill, and chooses neither. Sources have said of Season 5 that Sookie's "independent streak" will continue (as Alan Ball, executive producer) claimed in an interview concerning the upcoming season.  By the end of the season, Eric has regained his memories, though he retains his memory and part of the gentler personality he had when he was with Sookie.

In [[True Blood (season 5)|Season Five]], after previously killing Nan Flanagan, Eric and Bill are arrested by the Vampire Authority. However, Nora, Eric's 'sister' (with whom he also has a sexual history) rescues them. Later, all three are caught by the Authority. While Eric steers clear of the Sanguinista movement stirring in the authority and attempts to escape, Bill accepts the Book of Lilith and betrays him. Eric manages to successfully escape with Nora and searches for Sookie to enlist her help; in the process, he manages to kill his archenemy Russell Edgington, fulfilling a vengeance that he began when he was still human.  He attempts to save Bill but apparently fails.  Later, he returns Sookie's house to her for her protection; while she is grateful to him and considers him a friend, she still banishes him from the house, and Eric tells Nora they will stay away from her now.

In Season 6, Eric finds his latest threat to be the humans, especially Governor Truman Burrell, who declares war on vampires. In an effort to challenge the Governor's stance on vampires, Eric turns Willa Burrell, Truman's more open-minded daughter after noticing her selflessness of willingly dying for a cause similar to Nora. Regardless, the Governor has them both placed in "Vamp Camp", where Eric is later forced to helplessly watch his sister, Nora, receive a lethal injection of "Hep V".  Eric uses Willa to escape the camp (promising to get her and Pam out), but she also demands he frees Jessica &amp; Tara as well and takes Nora to the Lilith-enhanced Bill, but they are unable to save her. Devastated by her death, Eric violently slaughters the humans running the concentration camp to seek revenge and free both his progenies, among others.  Notably, Eric spares Jason Stackhouse, though he kills the vampire Steve Newlin, stating "Every time I lost someone I loved, ''you'' were there." (Blaming him for the deaths of Godric &amp; Nora), After freeing the imprisoned vampires, Eric flies off to grieve his sister Nora's death in solitude. In the finale, Warlow, the fairy-vampire hybrid whose blood made it possible for Eric and the other vampires to walk in the sun, is killed by Jason to save Sookie. When Warlow dies, the effects of his blood wears off in the vampires who drank it and they are no longer able to walk in the sun. Eric is shown in the sun on a mountain top in Åre, Sweden when Warlow's blood wears off, causing Eric to burn.

In Season 7, Pam tracks down Eric, who somehow avoided meeting the true death.  However, he has been infected with the Hepatitis V virus.
After learning that Sarah Newlin is still alive, he and Pam decide to go after her.  Eric and Pam soon learn that Newlin drank the antidote and it permeated her body, making Sarah a living antidote for Hep V.  They are forced to work with Yakuza ninjas from the Yakanomo Corporation (the company which originally made True Blood) in order to find her, but neither party trusts the other.  Upon capturing Sarah, Eric drinks her blood and rids himself of the Hep V virus, then the Yakuza suggest they make New Blood, but ensure it doesn’t work too well, so Vampires can buy more and increase the profit, and want Eric to be the face of New Blood. Learning that Bill is dying, Eric secretly reveals the cure (contrary to the Yakuza's wishes) to Sookie and offers to heal Bill, despite their long rivalry; he is stunned when Bill refuses.  However, after talking with Bill he understands his motives and tells Sookie to talk with him, making his final peace with both Bill and Sookie.  Eric  suggests to Pam, they let Sarah free, so the Yakuza members don’t get her, murder them all and collect all the profit, much to her delight, and they proceed to do all of it, and By the end of the series, they are running a multibillion-dollar corporation called New Blood, derived from Sarah Newlin's blood, which is both a new vampire food source and a universal cure for Hep V. Eric and Pam tell the world that Sarah got away from them, but they found a drop of her blood to make New Blood with, and thereby save every infected vampire in the world. In actuality, they are keeping Sarah chained in the basement at Fangtasia, and charging vampires small fortunes to feed on her, as she slowly goes insane. All the while, Eric sits on his throne on the Fangtasia stage, relishing his accomplishments.

== Interesting details ==

*He can fly.
*He can perform marriage services thanks to an online course from "Church of the Loving Spirit". He performed the wedding ceremony of The King of Mississippi and the King of Indiana.
*In the short story, "Dracula Night" by [[Charlaine Harris]], Eric hosts a party at Fangtasia each February 8th to celebrate the birthday of [[Dracula]] with hopes that the "Lord of Darkness" will make a personal appearance.  This hope is similar to [[Linus van Pelt]] waiting for the [[Great Pumpkin]] each [[Halloween]].

== Origin ==
Eric is frequently referred to as a [[Viking]]. In episode 4 of season 3 of ''True Blood'', Eric says he played by the [[North Sea]] as a child. In episode 10 of season 3, [[Pam Northman|Pam]] alludes to Eric being Swedish when she says, "I have no interest in inheriting your farm on [[Öland]].  That place is a windy shit-hole". Eric also speaks Swedish with Pam and Godric in some episodes.

We have seen a flashback of the time before Pam's turning, which was portrayed differently in ''True Blood'' than in the books. In the television series, Pam slits her own wrists after Eric denies her request to be turned, forcing him to do it to save her life. In the books, it is said that Eric offered her immortality.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders''' ('''FASDs''') are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; Problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, [[microcephaly|small head size]], poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, and [[hearing loss|problems with hearing]] or [[visual impairment|seeing]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canadian/&gt; Those affected are more likely to have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and have trouble with alcohol or other [[Recreational drug use|drugs]].&lt;ref name=Cor2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coriale|first1=G|last2=Fiorentino|first2=D|last3=Di Lauro|first3=F|last4=Marchitelli|first4=R|last5=Scalese|first5=B|last6=Fiore|first6=M|last7=Maviglia|first7=M|last8=Ceccanti|first8=M|title=Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD): neurobehavioral profile, indications for diagnosis and treatment.|journal=Rivista di psichiatria|date=2013|volume=48|issue=5|pages=359–69|pmid=24326748|doi=10.1708/1356.15062}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most severe form of the condition is known as '''fetal alcohol syndrome''' ('''FAS''').&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; Other types include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about FASDs|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=April 16, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523194618/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html|archivedate=23 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ril2011/&gt; Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.&lt;ref name=SBU2017&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/fetal-alcohol-syndrome-fas-and-fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorders-fasd--conditions-and-interventions/|title=Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) – conditions and interventions|publisher=[[Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services]] (SBU)|date=|website=www.sbu.se|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606050431/http://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/fetal-alcohol-syndrome-fas-and-fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorders-fasd--conditions-and-interventions/|archive-date=6 June 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-06-08|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; Surveys from the United States have found about 10% of pregnant women have drunk alcohol in the last month, and 20% to 30% drank at some point during the pregnancy.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; About 4.7% of North American women who are pregnant are [[alcoholism|alcoholics]].&lt;ref name=Mc2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McHugh|first1=RK|last2=Wigderson|first2=S|last3=Greenfield|first3=SF|title=Epidemiology of substance use in reproductive-age women.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology clinics of North America|date=June 2014|volume=41|issue=2|pages=177–89|pmid=24845483|doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2014.02.001|pmc=4068964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of problems depends on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption as well as when during pregnancy the alcohol is consumed.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Other risk factors include an older mother, [[smoking]], and poor diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Keshav Kumar|last2=Gupta|first2=Vinay Kumar|last3=Shirasaka|first3=Tomohiro|title=An Update on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome—Pathogenesis, Risks, and Treatment|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|date=2016|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1594–1602|pmid=27375266|doi=10.1111/acer.13135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Fetal Alcohol Exposure|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/FASDFactsheet/FASDfact.htm|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610050738/http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/FASDFactsheet/FASDfact.htm|archivedate=10 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no known safe amount or safe time to drink during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peds2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=J.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Types==
FASDs encompass a range of [[birth defect|physical]] and [[neurodevelopmental disorder|neurodevelopmental]] problems that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; The most severe condition is called fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS),&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; which refers to individuals who have a specific set of birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders characteristic of the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=kingdon&gt;{{citation|last=Kingdon|title=Research Review: Executive function deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder – a meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume=57|issue=2|pages=116–131|year=2016|doi=10.1111/jcpp.12451|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.&lt;ref name=SBU2017/&gt; Partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS) refers to individuals with a known, or highly suspected, history of prenatal alcohol exposure who have alcohol-related physical and neurodevelopmental deficits that do not meet the full criteria for FAS.&lt;ref name="kingdon" /&gt; The subtypes of pFAS are alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).&lt;ref name="kingdon" /&gt; In addition to FAS, pFAS, ARND, and ARBD, any other conditions believed to be related to prenatal alcohol exposure, such as [[spontaneous abortion]] and [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS), are also considered to be on the spectrum of related disorders.&lt;ref name="kingdon" /&gt; It is unclear {{as of|2017|lc=y}} if identifying a FASD-related conditions benefits the individual.&lt;ref name=SBU2017/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:FASkid.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|Facial characteristics of a child with FAS]]
The key of FASD can vary between individuals exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. While consensus exists for the definition and diagnosis of FAS, minor variations among the systems lead to differences in definitions and diagnostic cut-off criteria for other diagnoses across the FASD continuum.  The [[central nervous system]] damage criteria particularly lack clear consensus. A working knowledge of the key features is helpful in understanding FASD diagnoses and conditions, and each is reviewed with attention to similarities and differences across the four diagnostic systems. More than 400 problems, however, can occur with FASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/about_camh/newsroom/news_releases_media_advisories_and_backgrounders/current_year/Pages/More-than-400-conditions-co-occur-with-Fetal-Alcohol-Spectrum-Disorders-(FASD),-CAMH-study-finds.aspx|title=CAMH: More than 400 conditions co-occur with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), CAMH study finds|website=www.camh.ca|accessdate=2016-11-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121041944/http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/about_camh/newsroom/news_releases_media_advisories_and_backgrounders/current_year/Pages/More-than-400-conditions-co-occur-with-Fetal-Alcohol-Spectrum-Disorders-(FASD),-CAMH-study-finds.aspx|archivedate=21 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth===
In terms of FASD, [[Human development (biology)|growth]] deficiency is defined as significantly below average [[Human height|height]], [[Human weight|weight]] or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure, and can be assessed at any point in the [[Maximum life span|lifespan]]. Growth measurements must be adjusted for parental height, [[gestational age]] (for a [[premature birth|premature infant]]), and other [[postnatal]] insults (e.g., [[poor nutrition]]), although birth height and weight are the preferred measurements.&lt;ref name =4digitcode/&gt; Deficiencies are documented when height or weight falls at or below the 10th percentile of standardized growth charts appropriate to the population.&lt;ref name=growthchart&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm#Clin%202 Clinical growth charts.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203192127/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm |date=3 December 2010 }} National Center for Growth Statistics.  Retrieved on 2007-04-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Criteria for FASD are least specific in the IOM diagnostic system ("low birth weight..., decelerating weight not due to nutrition..., [or] disproportional low weight to height" p.&amp;nbsp;4 of executive summary),&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt; while the CDC and Canadian guidelines use the 10th percentile as a cut-off to determine growth deficiency.&lt;ref name=Canadian/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; The "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" allows for mid-range gradations in growth deficiency (between the 3rd and 10th percentiles) and severe growth deficiency at or below the 3rd percentile.&lt;ref name=4digitcode/&gt; Growth deficiency (at severe, moderate, or mild levels) contributes to diagnoses of FAS and pFAS, but not ARND or static encephalopathy.

Growth deficiency is ranked as follows by the "4-Digit Diagnostic Code":&lt;ref name=4digitcode&gt;Astley, S.J. (2004). ''Diagnostic Guide for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code''. Seattle: University of Washington. PDF available at [http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/4-digit-code.htm FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216110134/http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/4-digit-code.htm |date=16 December 2006 }}.  Retrieved on 2007-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Severe: Height and weight at or below the 3rd percentile.
* Moderate: Either height or weight at or below the 3rd percentile, but not both.
* Mild: Either height or weight or both between the 3rd and 10th percentiles.
* None: Height and weight both above the 10th percentile.

In the initial studies that discovered FAS, growth deficiency was a requirement for inclusion in the studies; thus, all the original people with FAS had growth deficiency as an [[Artifact (observational)|artifact]] of [[Chorionic villus sampling|sampling]] characteristics used to establish criteria for the syndrome.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} That is, growth deficiency is a key feature of FASD because growth deficiency was a criterion for inclusion in the study that defined FAS. This suggests growth deficiency may be less critical for understanding the disabilities of FASD than the neurobehavioral sequelae to the brain damage.&lt;ref name =IOM/&gt;

===Facial features===
Several characteristic [[craniofacial]] abnormalities are often visible in individuals with FAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones K, Smith D |title=The fetal alcohol syndrome |journal=Teratology |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=1975 |pmid=1162620 |doi=10.1002/tera.1420120102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of FAS facial features indicates [[brain damage]], although brain damage may also exist in their absence. FAS facial features (and most other visible, but non-diagnostic, deformities) are believed to be caused mainly during the 10th and 20th week of gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Renwick J, Asker R |title=Ethanol-sensitive times for the human conceptus |journal=Early Hum Dev |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=99–111 |year=1983 |pmid=6884260 |doi=10.1016/0378-3782(83)90065-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refinements in diagnostic criteria since 1975 have yielded three distinctive and diagnostically significant facial features known to result from prenatal alcohol exposure and distinguishes FAS from other disorders with partially overlapping characteristics.&lt;ref name =photo&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Astley SJ, Clarren SK | year = 1996 | title = Most FAS children have a smaller brain then other children "A case definition and photographic screening tool for the facial phenotype of fetal alcohol syndrome" | url = | journal = Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 129 | issue = 1| pages = 33–41 | pmid = 8757560 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(96)70187-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =photoapp&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Astley SJ, Stachowiak J, Clarren SK, Clausen C | year = 2002 | title = Application of the fetal alcohol syndrome facial photographic screening tool in a foster care population | url = | journal = Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 141 | issue = 5| pages = 712–717 | pmid = 12410204 | doi=10.1067/mpd.2002.129030}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three FAS facial features are:

* A smooth [[philtrum]]: The divot or groove between the nose and upper lip flattens with increased prenatal alcohol exposure.
* Thin vermilion: The [[upper lip]] thins with increased prenatal alcohol exposure.
* Small [[palpebral fissure]]s: [[human eyeball|Eye]] width decreases with increased prenatal alcohol exposure.

Measurement of FAS facial features uses criteria developed by the University of Washington. The lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the Lip-Philtrum Guide,&lt;ref name=lipphiltrum&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/lip-philtrum-guides.htm Lip-philtrum guides] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208212724/http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/lip-philtrum-guides.htm |date=8 February 2007 }}. FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network, University of Washington. Retrieved on 2007-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt; a five-point Likert Scale with representative photographs of lip and philtrum combinations ranging from normal (ranked 1) to severe (ranked 5). Palpebral fissure length (PFL) is measured in millimeters with either calipers or a clear ruler and then compared to a PFL growth chart, also developed by the University of Washington.&lt;ref name=facial&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/fas-face.htm FAS facial features] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027175622/http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/fas-face.htm |date=27 October 2007 }}. FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network, University of Washington. Retrieved on 2007-04-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Ranking FAS facial features is complicated because the three separate facial features can be affected independently by prenatal alcohol. A summary of the criteria follows:&lt;ref name=4digitcode/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Astley, Susan. [http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/pdfs/lipguides2004-backside.pdf Backside of Lip-Philtrum Guides (2004) (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619195808/http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/pdfs/lipguides2004-backside.pdf |date=19 June 2007 }}. University of Washington, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network. Retrieved on 2007-04-11&lt;/ref&gt;

* Severe: All three facial features ranked independently as severe (lip ranked at 4 or 5, philtrum ranked at 4 or 5, and PFL two or more standard deviations below average).
* Moderate: Two facial features ranked as severe and one feature ranked as moderate (lip ''or'' philtrum ranked at 3, ''or'' PFL between one and two standard deviations below average).
* Mild: A mild ranking of FAS facial features covers a broad range of facial feature combinations:
** Two facial features ranked severe and one ranked within normal limits,
** One facial feature ranked severe and two ranked moderate, or
**One facial feature ranked severe, one ranked moderate and one ranked within normal limits.
* None: All three facial features ranked within normal limits.

=== Central nervous system ===
[[Central nervous system]] (CNS) damage is the primary key feature of any FASD diagnosis. Prenatal alcohol exposure, which is classified as a [[teratogen]], can damage the brain across a continuum of gross to subtle impairments, depending on the amount, timing, and frequency of the exposure as well as genetic predispositions of the fetus and mother.&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, J.R. (Ed.) (1986).  ''Alcohol and Brain Development''. New York: Oxford University Press.{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While functional abnormalities are the behavioral and cognitive expressions of the FASD disability, CNS damage can be assessed in three areas: structural, neurological, and functional impairments.

All four diagnostic systems allow for assessment of CNS damage in these areas, but criteria vary.  The IOM system requires structural or neurological impairment for a diagnosis of FAS, but also allows a "complex pattern" of functional anomalies for diagnosing PFAS and ARND.&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt; The "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" and CDC guidelines allow for a positive CNS finding in any of the three areas for any FASD diagnosis, but functional anomalies must measure at two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains for a diagnosis of FAS, PFAS, and ARND.&lt;ref name=4digitcode/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; The "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" also allows for an FASD diagnosis when only two functional domains are measured at two standard deviations or worse.&lt;ref name=4digitcode/&gt; The "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" further elaborates the degree of CNS damage according to four ranks:

* Definite: Structural impairments or neurological impairments for FAS or static encephalopathy.
* Probable: Significant dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains.
* Possible: Mild to moderate dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in one or two functional domains ''or'' by judgment of the clinical evaluation team that CNS damage cannot be dismissed.
* Unlikely: No evidence of CNS damage.

====Structural====
Structural abnormalities of the brain are observable, physical damage to the brain or brain structures caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Structural impairments may include [[microcephaly]] (small head size) of two or more standard deviations below the average, or other abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., [[agenesis of the corpus callosum]], [[cerebellar hypoplasia]]).&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt;

Microcephaly is determined by comparing head circumference (often called [[Orbitofrontal cortex|occipitofrontal]] circumference, or OFC) to appropriate OFC growth charts.&lt;ref name=growthchart/&gt; Other structural impairments must be observed through [[medical imaging]] techniques by a trained physician. Because imaging procedures are expensive and relatively inaccessible to most people, diagnosis of FAS is not frequently made via structural impairments, except for microcephaly.

Evidence of a CNS structural impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS, and neurological and functional impairments are highly likely.&lt;ref name=Canadian/&gt;&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt;&lt;ref name=4digitcode/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

During the first trimester of pregnancy, alcohol interferes with the migration and organization of [[brain cell]]s, which can create structural deformities or deficits within the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarren S, Alvord E, Sumi S, Streissguth A, Smith D |title=Brain malformations related to prenatal exposure to ethanol |journal=J Pediatr |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=64–7 |year=1978 |pmid=619080 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(78)80072-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the third trimester, damage can be caused to the [[hippocampus]], which plays a role in memory, learning, emotion, and encoding visual and auditory information, all of which can create neurological and functional CNS impairments as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Coles C, Brown R, Smith I, Platzman K, Erickson S, Falek A |title=Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure at school age. I. Physical and cognitive development |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=357–67 |year=1991 |pmid=1921915 |doi=10.1016/0892-0362(91)90084-A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2002, there were 25 reports of [[Autopsy|autopsies]] on infants known to have FAS. The first was in 1973, on an infant who died shortly after birth.&lt;ref name=Jones1973/&gt; The examination revealed extensive brain damage, including microcephaly, migration anomalies, callosal dysgenesis, and a massive [[neuroglial]], [[leptomeningeal]] [[Heterotopia (medicine)|heterotopia]] covering the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Mattson10&gt;Mattson, S.N., &amp; Riley, E.P. (2002). "Neurobehavioral and Neuroanatomical Effects of Heavy Prenatal Exposure to Alcohol," in Streissguth and Kantor. (2002). p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Dr. Clarren described a second infant whose mother was a binge drinker. The infant died ten days after birth. The autopsy showed severe [[hydrocephalus]], abnormal neuronal migration, and a small [[corpus callosum]] (which connects the two [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemispheres]]) and [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name=Mattson10/&gt; FAS has also been linked to [[brainstem]] and cerebellar changes, [[agenesis of the corpus callosum]] and [[anterior commissure]], neuronal migration errors, absent [[olfactory bulb]]s, [[meningomyelocele]], and [[porencephaly]].&lt;ref name=Mattson10/&gt;

====Neurological====
When structural impairments are not observable or do not exist, neurological impairments are assessed. In the context of FASD, [[Neurology|neurological impairments]] are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure which causes general neurological damage to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), the [[peripheral nervous system]], or the [[autonomic nervous system]]. A determination of a neurological problem must be made by a trained physician, and must not be due to a postnatal insult, such as a high [[fever]], [[concussion]], [[traumatic brain injury]], etc.

All four diagnostic systems show virtual agreement on their criteria for CNS damage at the neurological level, and evidence of a CNS neurological impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS or pFAS, and functional impairments are highly likely.&lt;ref name=Canadian/&gt;&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt;&lt;ref name=4digitcode/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

Neurological problems are expressed as either hard signs, or diagnosable disorders, such as [[epilepsy]] or other [[seizure disorder]]s, or soft signs. Soft signs are broader, nonspecific neurological impairments, or symptoms, such as impaired [[fine motor skills]], [[sensory processing disorder|neurosensory]] [[hearing loss]], poor [[Gait (human)|gait]], [[developmental coordination disorder|clumsiness]], poor eye-hand coordination.  Many soft signs have [[Norm-referenced test|norm-referenced criteria]], while others are determined through clinical judgment.  "Clinical judgment" is only as good as the clinician, and soft signs should be assessed by either a pediatric neurologist, a pediatric neuropsychologist, or both.

====Functional====
When structural or neurological impairments are not observed, all four diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure to be assessed in terms of functional impairments.&lt;ref name=Canadian/&gt;&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt;&lt;ref name=4digitcode/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; Functional impairments are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, often referred to as [[developmental disabilities]]. There is no consensus on a specific pattern of functional impairments due to prenatal alcohol exposure&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt; and only CDC guidelines label developmental delays as such,&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; so criteria (and FASD diagnoses) vary somewhat across diagnostic systems.

The four diagnostic systems list various CNS domains that can qualify for functional impairment that can determine an FASD diagnosis:

* Evidence of a complex pattern of behavior or cognitive abnormalities inconsistent with developmental level in the following CNS domains – Sufficient for a pFAS or ARND diagnosis using IOM guidelines&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt;
** [[Learning disability|Learning disabilities]], academic achievement, [[Deferred gratification|impulse control]], [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social perception]], [[communication]], [[abstraction]], math skills, [[memory]], [[attention]], judgment
* Performance at two or more [[standard deviation]]s on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the following CNS domains – Sufficient for an FAS, pFAS or static encephalopathy diagnosis using 4-Digit Diagnostic Code&lt;ref name=4digitcode/&gt;
** [[Executive functioning]], [[memory]], [[cognition]], [[Adaptive behavior|social/adaptive skills]], academic achievement, [[communication|language]], [[motor skill]]s, [[attention]], activity level
* General [[cognitive]] deficits (e.g., [[IQ]]) at or below the 3rd percentile on [[standardized testing]] – Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using CDC guidelines&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;
* Performance at or below the 16th percentile on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the following CNS domains – Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using CDC guidelines&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;
** [[Cognition]], [[executive functioning]], [[motor skill|motor functioning]], [[ADHD|attention and hyperactive problems]], [[social skills]], [[sensory processing disorder]], social [[communication]], [[memory]], difficulties responding to common [[parenting]] practices
* Performance at two or more [[standard deviation]]s on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the following CNS domains – Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using Canadian guidelines
** Cognition, [[communication]], academic achievement, [[memory]], [[executive functioning]], [[adaptive behavior]], [[motor skills]], [[social skills]], social [[communication]]

===Related signs===
Other conditions may commonly co-occur with FAS, stemming from prenatal alcohol exposure. However, these conditions are considered [[Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder#Alcohol-Related Birth Defects|alcohol-related birth defects]]&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt; and not diagnostic criteria for FAS.

==Cause==
Fetal alcohol syndrome usually occurs when a pregnant woman has more than four [[standard drink]]s per day.&lt;ref name=Yaf2011/&gt; Milder symptoms have been found with two drinks per day during the early part of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Yaf2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pregnancy and alcohol: occasional, light drinking may be safe|journal=Prescrire Int.|date=Feb 2012|volume=21|issue=124|pages=44–50|pmid=22413723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who are alcoholic about a third of children have FAS.&lt;ref name=Yaf2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yaffe|first1=Sumner J.|title=Drugs in pregnancy and lactation : a reference guide to fetal and neonatal risk|date=2011|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781608317080|page=527|edition=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIgTE4aynrMC&amp;pg=PA527|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910233951/https://books.google.com/books?id=OIgTE4aynrMC&amp;pg=PA527|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
Despite intense research efforts, the exact mechanism for the development of FAS or FASD is unknown. On the contrary, clinical and animal studies have identified a broad spectrum of pathways through which maternal alcohol can negatively affect the outcome of a pregnancy. Clear conclusions with universal validity are difficult to draw, since different ethnic groups show considerable [[genetic polymorphism]] for the hepatic enzymes responsible for ethanol detoxification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Warren K. |author2=Li T-K | year = 2005 | title =  Genetic polymorphisms: Impact on the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders| url = | journal = Birth Defect Res A | volume = 73 | issue = 4| pages = 195–203 | doi=10.1002/bdra.20125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic examinations have revealed a continuum of long-lasting molecular effects that are not only timing specific but are also dosage specific; with even moderate amounts being able to cause alterations.&lt;ref name=Lauferetal2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laufer BI, Mantha K, Kleiber ML, Diehl EJ, Addison SM, Singh SM |title=Long-lasting alterations to DNA methylation and ncRNAs could underlie the effects of fetal alcohol exposure in mice |journal=Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=977–92 |date=July 2013 |pmid=23580197 |pmc=3701217 |doi=10.1242/dmm.010975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A human fetus appears to be at triple risk from maternal alcohol consumption:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brien J. | year = 1983 | title =Disposition of ethanol in human maternal venous blood and amniotic fluid| pmid =6846436| journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 146 | issue = 2| pages = 181–186 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1016/0002-9378(83)91050-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nava-Ocampo A. | year = 2004 | title =Elimination kinetics of ethanol in pregnant women| pmid =15135856 | journal = Reproduct Toxicol | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 613–617 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1016/j.reprotox.2004.02.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The placenta allows free entry of ethanol and toxic metabolites like acetaldehyde into the fetal compartment. The so-called placental barrier is of almost no barrier with respect to ethanol.
# The developing fetal nervous system appears particularly sensitive to ethanol toxicity. The latter interferes with proliferation, differentiation, neuronal migration, axonic outgrowth, integration, and fine-tuning of the synaptic network. In short, all major processes in the developing central nervous system appear compromised.
# Fetal tissues are quite different from adult tissues in function and purpose.  For example, the main detoxicating organ in adults is the [[Human liver|liver]], whereas the fetal liver is incapable of detoxifying ethanol, as the ADH and ALDH enzymes have not yet been brought to expression at this early stage.  Up to term, fetal tissues do not have significant capacity for the detoxification of ethanol, and the [[fetus]] remains exposed to ethanol in the amniotic fluid for periods far longer than the decay time of ethanol in the maternal circulation. The lack of significant quantities of ADH and ALDH means that fetal tissues have much lower quantities of antioxidant enzymes, like [[Superoxide dismutase|SOD]], glutathione transferases, and [[Glutathione peroxidase|glutathion peroxidases]], resulting in antioxidant protection being much less effective.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Diagnosis==
Because admission of alcohol use during pregnancy can stigmatize birth mothers, many are reluctant to admit drinking or to provide an accurate report of the quantity they drank. This complicates diagnosis and treatment &lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; of the syndrome. As a result, diagnosis of the severity of FASD relies on protocols of observation of the child's physiology and behavior rather than maternal self-reporting. 
Presently, four FASD diagnostic systems that diagnose FAS and other FASD conditions have been developed in North America:
* The [[Institute of Medicine]]'s guidelines for FAS, the first system to standardize diagnoses of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure;&lt;ref name =IOM/&gt;
* The [[University of Washington]]'s "The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code," which ranks the four key features of FASD on a [[Likert scale]] of one to four and yields 256 descriptive codes that can be categorized into 22 distinct clinical categories, ranging from FAS to no findings;&lt;ref name=4digitcode/&gt;
* The [[Centers for Disease Control]]'s "Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis," which established consensus on the diagnosis FAS in the U.S. but deferred addressing other FASD conditions;&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/publications/FAS_guidelines_accessible.pdf Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis (PDF).]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} CDC (July 2004).  Retrieved on 2009-09-22&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Canadian guidelines for FASD diagnoses, which established criteria for diagnosing FASD in Canada and harmonized most differences between the IOM and University of Washington's systems.&lt;ref name=Canadian&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chudley|title=Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: Canadian guidelines for diagnosis|journal=CMAJ|volume=172|issue=5 Suppl|pages=S1–S21|year=2005|pmid=15738468|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/172/5_suppl/S1|accessdate=20 November 2016|doi=10.1503/cmaj.1040302|pmc=557121|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610210325/http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/172/5_suppl/S1|archivedate=10 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each diagnostic system requires that a complete FASD evaluation includes an assessment of the four key features of FASD, described below. A positive finding on all four features is required for a diagnosis of FAS. However, prenatal alcohol exposure and central nervous system damage are the critical elements of the spectrum of FASD, and a positive finding in these two features is sufficient for an FASD diagnosis that is not "full-blown FAS".

While the four diagnostic systems essentially agree on criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), there are still differences when full criteria for FAS are not met. This has resulted in differing and evolving nomenclature for other conditions across the spectrum of FASD, which may account for such a wide variety of terminology. Most individuals with deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure do not express all features of FAS and fall into other FASD conditions.&lt;ref name =IOM/&gt; The Canadian guidelines recommend the assessment and descriptive approach of the "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" for each key feature of FASD and the terminology of the IOM in diagnostic categories, excepting ARBD.&lt;ref name=Canadian/&gt;

Thus, other FASD conditions are partial expressions of FAS. However, these other FASD conditions may create disabilities similar to FAS if the key area of central nervous system damage shows clinical deficits in two or more of [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder#Ten brain domains|ten domains of brain functioning]]. Essentially, even though growth deficiency and/or FAS facial features may be mild or nonexistent in other FASD conditions, yet clinically significant brain damage of the central nervous system is present. In these other FASD conditions, an individual may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes because brain damage is present without associated visual cues of poor growth or the "FAS face" that might ordinarily trigger an FASD evaluation. Such individuals may be misdiagnosed with primary [[DSM-IV Codes|mental health disorders]] such as [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] or [[oppositional defiance disorder]] without appreciation that brain damage is the underlying cause of these disorders, which requires a different treatment paradigm than typical mental health disorders. While other FASD conditions may not yet be included as an [[ICD]] or [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] diagnosis, they nonetheless pose significant impairment in [[Adaptive behavior|functional behavior]] because of underlying brain damage.

===Fetal alcohol syndrome===
The following criteria must be fully met for an FAS diagnosis:&lt;ref name =Canadian/&gt;&lt;ref name =IOM/&gt;&lt;ref name =4digitcode/&gt;&lt;ref name =CDC/&gt;

# Growth deficiency: Prenatal or postnatal height or weight (or both) at or below the 10th percentile&lt;ref name="growthchart"/&gt;
# FAS facial features: All three FAS facial features present&lt;ref name =facial/&gt;
# Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural neurological, ''or'' functional impairment
# Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed or Unknown prenatal alcohol exposure

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the first diagnosable condition of FASD that was discovered. FAS is the only expression of FASD that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official [[ICD-9]] and [[ICD-10]] diagnosis. To make this diagnosis or determine any FASD condition, a [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary]] evaluation is necessary to assess each of the four key features for assessment. Generally, a trained [[physician]] will determine growth deficiency and FAS facial features. While a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities and/or neurological problems, usually central nervous system damage is determined through [[Psychological testing|psychological]], [[Speech pathology|speech-language]], and [[occupational therapy]] assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains.&lt;ref name =Lang/&gt; Prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician, [[psychologist]], [[social work]]er, or chemical health counselor. These professionals work together as a team to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative, multi-disciplinary report to diagnose FAS (or other FASD conditions) in an individual.

===Partial FAS===
Partial FAS (pFAS), previously known as atypical FAS in the 1997 edition of the "4-Digit Diagnostic Code". People with pFAS have a confirmed history of prenatal alcohol exposure, but may lack growth deficiency or the complete facial stigmata. Central nervous system damage is present at the same level as FAS. These individuals have the same functional disabilities but "look" less like FAS.

The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of Partial FAS:&lt;ref name =Canadian/&gt;&lt;ref name =IOM/&gt;&lt;ref name =4digitcode/&gt;

# Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to deficient&lt;ref name =growthchart/&gt;
# FAS facial features: Two or three FAS facial features present&lt;ref name =facial/&gt;
# Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, ''or'' functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains&lt;ref name =Lang/&gt;
# Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure

===Fetal alcohol effects===
Fetal alcohol effects (FAE) is a previous term for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; It was initially used in research studies to describe humans and animals in whom teratogenic effects were seen after confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (or unknown exposure for humans), but without obvious physical anomalies.&lt;ref name =FAE/&gt; Smith (1981) described FAE as an "extremely important concept" to highlight the debilitating effects of brain damage, regardless of the growth or facial features.&lt;ref name =FAESmith&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith D.W. | year = 1981 | title = Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects | url = | journal = Neurobehavioral Toxicology and Teratology | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This term has fallen out of favor with clinicians because it was often regarded by the public as a less severe disability than FAS, when in fact its effects can be just as detrimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aase J.M. |author2=Jones K.L. |author3=Clarren S.K. | year = 1995 | title = Do we need the term FAE? | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 428–430 | pmid = 7862486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder====
Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) was initially suggested by the Institute of Medicine to replace the term FAE and focus on central nervous system damage, rather than growth deficiency or FAS facial features. The Canadian guidelines also use this diagnosis and the same criteria. While the "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" includes these criteria for three of its diagnostic categories, it refers to this condition as [[encephalopathy|static encephalopathy]]. The behavioral effects of ARND are not necessarily unique to alcohol however, so use of the term must be within the context of confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure.&lt;ref name =FASGuide/&gt; ARND may be gaining acceptance over the terms FAE and ARBD to describe FASD conditions with central nervous system abnormalities or behavioral or cognitive abnormalities or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure without regard to growth deficiency or FAS facial features.&lt;ref name =FASGuide/&gt;&lt;ref name =MalbinTry&gt;Malbin, D. (2002). ''Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: Trying Differently Rather Than Harder''. Portland, OR: FASCETS, Inc. {{ISBN|0-9729532-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of ARND or static encephalopathy:&lt;ref name =Canadian/&gt;&lt;ref name =IOM/&gt;&lt;ref name =4digitcode/&gt;

# Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to minimally deficient&lt;ref name =growthchart/&gt;
# FAS facial features: Minimal or no FAS facial features present&lt;ref name =facial/&gt;
# Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, ''or'' functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains&lt;ref name =Lang/&gt;
# Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure;0

====Alcohol-related birth defects====
Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), formerly known as possible fetal alcohol effect (PFAE),&lt;ref name=FAE/&gt; was a term proposed as an alternative to FAE and PFAE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.1989.tb00384.x |author1=Sokol R.J. |author2=Clarren S.K. | year = 1989 | title = Guidelines for use of terminology describing the impact of prenatal alcohol on the offspring | url = | journal = Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 597–598 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOM presents ARBD as a list of congenital anomalies that are linked to maternal alcohol use but have no key features of FASD.&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt; PFAE and ARBD have fallen out of favor because these anomalies are not necessarily specific to maternal alcohol consumption and are not criteria for diagnosis of FASD.&lt;ref name=FASGuide&gt;Streissguth, A. (1997). ''Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: A Guide for Families and Communities''. Baltimore: Brookes Publishing. {{ISBN|1-55766-283-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian guidelines recommend that ARBD should not be used as an umbrella term or diagnostic category for FASD.

===Exposure===
Prenatal alcohol exposure is determined by interview of the biological mother or other family members knowledgeable of the mother's alcohol use during the pregnancy (if available), prenatal health records (if available), and review of available birth records, court records (if applicable), [[drug rehabilitation|chemical dependency treatment]] records (if applicable), or other reliable sources.

Exposure level is assessed as ''confirmed exposure'', ''unknown exposure'', and ''confirmed absence of exposure'' by the IOM, CDC and Canadian diagnostic systems. The "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" further distinguishes confirmed exposure as ''High Risk'' and ''Some Risk'':

* High Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy known to be at high [[blood alcohol content|blood alcohol levels]] (100&amp;nbsp;mg/dL or greater) delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy.
* Some Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy with use less than High Risk or unknown usage patterns.
* Unknown Risk: Unknown use of alcohol during pregnancy.
* No Risk: Confirmed absence of prenatal alcohol exposure.

====Confirmed exposure====
Amount, frequency, and timing of prenatal alcohol use can dramatically impact the other three key features of FASD. While consensus exists that alcohol is a teratogen, there is no clear consensus as to what level of exposure is toxic.&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt; The CDC guidelines are silent on these elements diagnostically. The IOM and Canadian guidelines explore this further, acknowledging the importance of significant alcohol exposure from regular or heavy episodic alcohol consumption in determining, but offer no standard for diagnosis. Canadian guidelines discuss this lack of clarity and parenthetically point out that "heavy alcohol use" is defined by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] as five or more drinks per episode on five or more days during a 30-day period.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2000). National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. ''Tenth special report to the U.S Congress on alcohol and health: Highlights frfom current research''. Washington, DC: The Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code" ranking system distinguishes between levels of prenatal alcohol exposure as ''high risk'' and ''some risk''. It operationalizes high risk exposure as a [[blood alcohol content|blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) greater than 100&amp;nbsp;mg/dL delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. This BAC level is typically reached by a 55&amp;nbsp;kg female drinking six to eight beers in one sitting.&lt;ref name =4digitcode/&gt;

====Unknown exposure====
For many adopted or adults and children in foster care, records or other reliable sources may not be available for review. Reporting alcohol use during pregnancy can also be stigmatizing to birth mothers, especially if alcohol use is ongoing.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; In these cases, all diagnostic systems use an unknown prenatal alcohol exposure designation. A diagnosis of FAS is still possible with an unknown exposure level if other key features of FASD are present at clinical levels.

====Confirmed absence of exposure====
Confirmed absence of exposure would apply to planned pregnancies in which no alcohol was used or pregnancies of women who do not use alcohol or report no use during the pregnancy. This designation is relatively rare, as most people presenting for an FASD evaluation are at least ''suspected'' to have had a prenatal alcohol exposure due to presence of other key features of FASD.&lt;ref name =4digitcode/&gt;&lt;ref name =CDC/&gt;

===Ten brain domains===
A recent effort to standardize assessment of functional CNS damage has been suggested by an experienced FASD diagnostic team in Minnesota. The proposed framework attempts to harmonize IOM, 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, CDC, and Canadian guidelines for measuring CNS damage vis-à-vis FASD evaluations and diagnosis. The standardized approach is referred to as the Ten Brain Domains and encompasses aspects of all four diagnostic systems' recommendations for assessing CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure. The framework provides clear definitions of brain dysfunction, specifies empirical data needed for accurate diagnosis, and defines intervention considerations that address the complex nature of FASD with the intention to avoid common secondary disabilities.&lt;ref name=Lang/&gt;

The proposed Ten Brain Domains include:&lt;ref name=Lang/&gt;
*[[Outcome-based education|Achievement]], [[adaptive behavior]], [[attention]], [[cognition]], [[executive functioning]], [[language]], [[memory]], [[motor skills]], [[multisensory integration]] or soft [[Neurology|neurological]] problems, social [[communication]]&lt;ref name=Lang&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lang |first1=Jeannette |year=2006 |title=Ten Brain Domains: A Proposal for Functional Central Nervous System Parameters for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis and Follow-up |journal=Journal of the FAS Institute |volume=4 |pages=1–11 |url=http://www.motherisk.org/JFAS_documents/JFAS_5012_Final_e12_6.28.6.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926012830/http://www.motherisk.org/JFAS_documents/JFAS_5012_Final_e12_6.28.6.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program (FADP) uses unpublished Minnesota state criteria of performance at 1.5 or more [[standard deviation]]s on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains to determine CNS damage. However, the Ten Brain Domains are easily incorporated into any of the four diagnostic systems' CNS damage criteria, as the framework only proposes the domains, rather than the cut-off criteria for FASD.&lt;ref name=fadp&gt;[http://www.fadpmn.org FADP – Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223032007/http://www.fadpmn.org/ |date=23 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
The CDC reviewed nine [[syndromes]] that have overlapping features with FAS; however, none of these syndromes include all three FAS facial features, and none are the result of prenatal alcohol exposure:&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;
*[[Aarskog syndrome]]
*[[Williams syndrome]]
*[[Noonan syndrome]]
*[[ICD-10 Chapter XVII: Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities|Dubowitz syndrome]]
*[[Cornelia de Lange syndrome|Brachman-DeLange syndrome]]
*[[Toluene (toxicology)|Toluene syndrome]]
*[[Fetal hydantoin syndrome]]
*[[Neural tube defects|Fetal valproate syndrome]]
*Maternal [[Phenylketonuria|PKU]] fetal effects

==Prevention==
The only certain way to prevent FAS is to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=FASGuide/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alcohol and Pregnancy Questions and Answers {{!}} FASD {{!}} NCBDDD {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/faqs.html|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=25 September 2017|language=en-us|date=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] recommended in 1981, and again in 2005, that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or while planning a pregnancy, the latter to avoid damage even in the earliest stages (even weeks) of a pregnancy, as the woman may not be aware that she has [[Fertilisation|conceived]].&lt;ref name=SG/&gt; In the United States, federal legislation has required that warning labels be placed on all alcoholic beverage containers since 1988 under the [[Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act]].

There is some controversy surrounding the "zero-tolerance" approach taken by many countries when it comes to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The assertion that moderate drinking causes FAS is said to lack strong evidence and, in fact, the practice of equating a responsible level of drinking with potential harm to the fetus may have negative social, legal, and health impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/3/276.full |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331002011/http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/3/276.full |archivedate=31 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, special care should be taken when considering statistics on this disease, as prevalence and causation is often linked with FASD, which is more common and causes less harm, as opposed to FAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/data.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728021804/https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/data.html |archivedate=28 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
There is no cure for FASD, but treatment is possible. Because CNS damage, symptoms, secondary disabilities, and needs vary widely by individual, there is no one treatment type that works for everyone.

===Medication===
[[Psychoactive drug]]s are frequently tried on those with FASD as many FASD symptoms are mistaken for or overlap with other disorders, most notably [[ADHD]].&lt;ref name=Buxton/&gt;

===Behavioral interventions===
[[Behaviorism|Behavioral]] interventions are based on the [[Learning theory (education)|learning theory]], which is the basis for many parenting and [[Psychology|professional]] strategies and interventions.&lt;ref name=MalbinTry/&gt; Along with ordinary [[parenting styles]], such strategies are frequently used by default for treating those with FAS, as the diagnoses [[oppositional defiance disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder]], [[reactive attachment disorder]] (RAD) often overlap with FAS (along with [[ADHD]]), and these are sometimes thought to benefit from behavioral interventions. Frequently, a person's poor academic achievement results in [[special education]] services, which also utilizes principles of [[Learning theory (education)|learning theory]], [[behavior modification]], and [[outcome-based education]].

===Developmental framework===
Many books and handouts on FAS recommend a developmental approach, based on [[developmental psychology]], even though most do not specify it as such and provide little theoretical background. Optimal human development generally occurs in identifiable stages (e.g., [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[theory of cognitive development]], [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]], [[John Bowlby]]'s [[Attachment theory|attachment framework]], and other [[developmental stage theories]]). FAS interferes with normal development,&lt;ref name=McCreight/&gt; which may cause stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed. Over time, an unaffected child can negotiate the increasing demands of life by progressing through stages of development normally, but not so for a child with FAS.&lt;ref name=McCreight/&gt;

By knowing what developmental stages and tasks children follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can be tailored to helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully.&lt;ref name=McCreight/&gt; If a person is delayed in the [[adaptive behavior]] domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying shoelaces), giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using slip-on shoes) to support the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's developmental context into account while developing interventions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Advocacy model===
The [[advocacy]] model takes the point of view that someone is needed to actively mediate between the environment and the person with FAS.&lt;ref name=FASGuide/&gt; Advocacy activities are conducted by an advocate (for example, a family member, friend, or [[Case management (mental health)|case manager]]) and fall into three basic categories. An advocate for FAS: (1) interprets FAS and the disabilities that arise from it and explains it to the environment in which the person operates, (2) engenders change or accommodation on behalf of the person, and (3) assists the person in developing and reaching attainable goals.&lt;ref name=FASGuide/&gt;

The advocacy model is often recommended, for example, when developing an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) for the person's progress at school.&lt;ref name=Buxton&gt;Buxton, B. (2005). ''Damaged Angels: An Adoptive Mother Discovers the Tragic Toll of Alcohol in Pregnancy''. New York: Carroll &amp; Graf. {{ISBN|0-7867-1550-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An understanding of the developmental framework would presumably inform and enhance the advocacy model, but advocacy also implies interventions at a systems level as well, such as educating schools, social workers, and so forth on best practices for FAS. However, several organizations devoted to FAS also use the advocacy model at a [[community practice]] level as well.&lt;ref name=agencies&gt;[http://www.nofas.org National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405231125/http://www.nofas.org/ |date=5 April 2007 }} [http://www.mofas.org Minnesota Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405231157/http://www.mofas.org/ |date=5 April 2007 }}  Retrieved on 2007-04-11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public health and policy===
Treating FAS at the [[public health]] and [[public policy]] level promotes FAS prevention and diversion of [[Public services|public resources]] to assist those with FAS.&lt;ref name=FASGuide/&gt; It is related to the advocacy model but promoted at a systems level (rather than with the individual or family), such as developing community education and supports, state or province level prevention efforts (e.g., screening for maternal alcohol use during [[OB/GYN]] or prenatal medical care visits), or national awareness programs. Several organizations and state agencies in the U.S. are dedicated to this type of intervention.&lt;ref name=agencies/&gt;

The US Centers for Disease Control estimates 3 million women in the United States are at risk of having a baby with FASD, and recommended that women of child-bearing age should be on birth control or abstain from drinking alcohol as the safest way to avoid this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0202-alcohol-exposed-pregnancy.html|title=More than 3 million US women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy &amp;#124; CDC Online Newsroom &amp;#124; CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=2016-11-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121002034/https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0202-alcohol-exposed-pregnancy.html|archivedate=21 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==

===Primary disabilities===
The primary disabilities of FAS are the functional difficulties with which the child is born as a result of CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure.&lt;ref name=2disabilities&gt;Streissguth, A.P., Barr, H.M., Kogan, J., &amp; Bookstein, F.L. (1996). ''Understanding the occurrence of secondary disabilities in clients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE): Final report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Grant No. RO4/CCR008515'' (Tech. Report No. 96-06). Seattle: University of Washington, Fetal Alcohol and Drug Unit.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, primary disabilities are mistaken as ''behavior problems'', but the underlying CNS damage is the originating source of a functional difficulty,&lt;ref name=MalbinFAE&gt;Malbin, D. (1993). ''Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Fetal Alcohol Effects: Strategies for Professionals''. Center City, MN: Hazelden. {{ISBN|0-89486-951-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a mental health condition, which is considered a secondary disability.

The exact mechanisms for functional problems of primary disabilities are not always fully understood, but [[Animal testing|animal studies]] have begun to shed light on some correlates between functional problems and brain structures damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure.&lt;ref name=FASGuide/&gt; Representative examples include:

* [[Learning disability|Learning impairments]] are associated with impaired [[dendrite]]s of the [[hippocampus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abel EL, Jacobson S, Sherwin BT | year = 1983 | title = In utero alcohol exposure: Functional and structural brain damage | url = | journal = Neurobehavioral Toxicology and Teratology | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 363–366 | pmid = 6877477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Impaired [[Motor skill|motor development]] and functioning are associated with reduced size of the [[cerebellum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meyer L, Kotch L, Riley E |title=Neonatal ethanol exposure: functional alterations associated with cerebellar growth retardation |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15–22 |year=1990 |pmid=2314357 |doi=10.1016/0892-0362(90)90107-N}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hyperactivity]] is associated with decreased size of the [[corpus callosum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zimmerberg B, Mickus LA | year = 1990 | title = Sex differences in corpus callosum: Influence of prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal undernutrition | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 537 | issue = 1–2| pages = 115–122 | pmid = 2085766 | doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)90347-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional difficulties may result from CNS damage in more than one domain, but common functional difficulties by domain include:&lt;ref name=FASGuide/&gt;&lt;ref name=MalbinTry/&gt;&lt;ref name=McCreight&gt;McCreight, B. (1997). ''Recognizing and Managing Children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Fetal Alcohol Effects: A Guidebook''. Washington, DC: CWLA. {{ISBN|0-87868-607-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MalbinFAE/&gt; Note that this is not an exhaustive list of difficulties.

* Achievement: [[Learning disability|Learning disabilities]]
* Adaptive behavior: Poor [[Deferred gratification|impulse control]], poor [[personal boundaries]], poor [[anger management]], stubbornness, intrusive behavior, too friendly with strangers, poor [[daily living skills]], developmental delays
* Attention: [[ADHD|Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder]] (ADHD), poor attention or concentration, distractible
* Cognition: [[Intellectual disability]], confusion under pressure, poor [[Abstraction|abstract skills]], difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality, slower [[cognitive processing]]
* Executive functioning: Poor [[Decision making|judgment]], [[Sensory processing disorder|Information-processing disorder]], poor at perceiving patterns, poor cause and effect reasoning, inconsistent at linking words to actions, poor [[generalization]] ability
* Language: [[Expressive language disorder|Expressive]] or [[Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder|receptive]] language disorders, grasp parts but not whole concepts, lack understanding of metaphor, idioms, or sarcasm
* Memory: Poor [[short-term memory]], inconsistent memory and knowledge base
* Motor skills: Poor handwriting, poor [[fine motor skill]]s, poor [[gross motor skill]]s, [[Developmental coordination disorder|delayed motor skill development]] (e.g., riding a bicycle at appropriate age)
* [[Sensory processing]] and soft neurological problems: [[sensory processing disorder]], sensory defensiveness, undersensitivity to stimulation
* Social communication: Intrude into conversations, inability to read [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal]] or [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social]] cues, "chatty" but without substance

===Secondary disabilities===
The secondary disabilities of FAS are those that arise later in life secondary to CNS damage. These disabilities often emerge over time due to a mismatch between the primary disabilities and environmental expectations; secondary disabilities can be ameliorated with early interventions and appropriate supportive services.&lt;ref name=2disabilities/&gt;

Six main secondary disabilities were identified in a University of Washington research study of 473 subjects diagnosed with FAS, PFAS (partial fetal alcohol syndrome), and ARND (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder):&lt;ref name=FASGuide/&gt;&lt;ref name=2disabilities/&gt;

* Mental health problems: Diagnosed with [[ADHD]], [[Clinical Depression]], or other [[mental illness]], experienced by over 90% of the subjects
* Disrupted school experience: Suspended or expelled from school or dropped out of school, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Trouble with the law: Charged or convicted with a crime, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Confinement: For inpatient psychiatric care, inpatient chemical dependency care, or incarcerated for a crime, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Inappropriate sexual behavior: Sexual advances, sexual touching, or promiscuity, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Alcohol and drug problems: Abuse or dependency, experienced by 35% of the subjects (age 12 and older)

Two additional secondary disabilities exist for adults:&lt;ref name=FASGuide/&gt;&lt;ref name=2disabilities/&gt;

* Dependent living: Group home, living with family or friends, or some sort of assisted living, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older)
* Problems with employment: Required ongoing job training or coaching, could not keep a job, unemployed, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older)

===Protective factors and strengths===
Eight factors were identified in the same study as universal protective factors that reduced the incidence rate of the secondary disabilities:&lt;ref name=FASGuide/&gt;&lt;ref name=2disabilities/&gt;
* Living in a stable and nurturing home for over 73% of life
* Being diagnosed with FAS before age six
* Never having experienced violence
* Remaining in each living situation for at least 2.8 years
* Experiencing a "good quality home" (meeting 10 or more defined qualities) from age 8 to 12 years old
* Having been found eligible for developmental disability (DD) services
* Having basic needs met for at least 13% of life
* Having a diagnosis of FAS (rather than another FASD condition)

Malbin (2002) has identified the following areas of interests and talents as strengths that often stand out for those with FASD and should be utilized, like any strength, in treatment planning:&lt;ref name="MalbinTry"/&gt;
*Music, playing instruments, composing, singing, art, spelling, reading, computers, mechanics, woodworking, skilled vocations (welding, electrician, etc.), writing, poetry
*Participation in non-impact sport or physical fitness activities

==Epidemiology==
FASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Prev/&gt; FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1000 live births in the United States.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Prev/&gt; The lifetime cost of an individual with FAS were estimated to be two million USD in 2002.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Prev/&gt;

===Australia ===

FASD among [[Australian]] youth is more common in [[Aboriginal Australians|indigenous]] Australians.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol use in pregnancy: A survey of Paediatricians' knowledge, attitudes and practice|last = Elliot|first = E.

==History==

From the 1960s to the 1980s, alcohol was commonly used as a [[tocolytic]], a method to stop preterm labor. The method originated with Dr. Fritz Fuchs, the chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Cornell University Medical College.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, E. M. 2003"&gt;Armstrong, E. M. (2003). Conceiving risk, bearing responsibility: Fetal alcohol syndrome &amp; the diagnosis of moral disorder.

In later stages of pregnancy, the alcohol was administered intravenously and often in large amounts. "Women experienced similar effects as occur with oral ingestion, including intoxication, nausea and vomiting, and potential alcohol poisoning, followed by hangovers when the alcohol was discontinued."&lt;ref&gt;King, T. L., &amp; Brucker, M. C. (2011). Pharmacology for women's health. Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett.&lt;/ref&gt; Vomiting put the mother at a high risk for aspiration and was "a brutal procedure for all involved." &lt;ref name="Armstrong, E. M. 2003"/&gt; Because the alcohol was being given intravenously, the doctor could continue giving the treatment to the mother long after she had passed out, resulting in her being more intoxicated than would otherwise be possible. Such heavy intoxication is highly likely to contribute to FASD.&lt;ref name="Armstrong, E. M. 2003"/&gt;

[[wikisource:Jackson, Randle (DNB00)|Biography of author Randle Jackson]]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other such historical references. In Gaelic Scotland, the mother and nurse were not allowed to consume [[ale]] during pregnancy and breastfeeding ([[Martin Martin]]). Claims that alcohol consumption caused idiocy were part of the Teetotalism's message in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Townley Crane, Arts of Intoxication: The Aim and the Results. (New York:Carlton &amp; Lanahan, 1870), 173-175&lt;/ref&gt; but such claims, despite some attempts to offer evidence, were ignored because no mechanism could be advanced.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer L. Tait ''The Poisoned Chalice'' (Tuscaloosa, AL: University of Alabama Press, 2010), 27,28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest recorded observation of possible links between maternal alcohol use and fetal damage was made in 1899 by Dr. William Sullivan, a [[Liverpool]] prison physician who noted higher rates of [[stillbirth]] for 120 alcoholic female prisoners than their sober female relatives; he suggested the causal agent to be alcohol use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sullivan W.C. | year = 1899 | title = A note on the influence of maternal inebriety on the offspring | url = | journal = Journal of Mental Science | volume = 45 | issue = 190| pages = 489–503 | doi=10.1192/bjp.45.190.489}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicted the predominating belief at the time that heredity caused intellectual disability, poverty, and criminal behavior, which contemporary studies on the subjects usually concluded.&lt;ref name=FASGuide/&gt; A case study by [[Henry H.

(1942). ''Alcohol Explored''. New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to fetal alcohol syndrome being specifically identified and named in 1973, only a few studies had noted differences between the children of mothers who used alcohol during [[pregnancy]] or [[breast-feeding]] and those who did not, and identified alcohol use as a possible contributing factor rather than heredity.&lt;ref name=FASGuide/&gt;

===Recognition as a syndrome===
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome was named in 1973 by two [[Dysmorphology|dysmorphologists]], Drs. Kenneth Lyons Jones and [[David Weyhe Smith]] of the [[University of Washington]] Medical School in [[Seattle]], United States. They identified a pattern of "craniofacial, limb, and cardiovascular defects associated with prenatal onset growth deficiency and developmental delay" in eight unrelated children of three [[Ethnicity|ethnic]] groups, all born to mothers who were [[alcoholic]]s.&lt;ref name=Jonesetal1973/&gt; The pattern of malformations indicated that the damage was prenatal.

Dr. Paul Lemoine of [[Nantes]], France had already published a study in a French medical journal in 1968 about children with distinctive features whose mothers were alcoholics,&lt;ref name=Lemoine&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lemoine P. |author2=Harousseau H. |author3=Borteyru J.B. |author4=Menuet J.C. | year = 1968 | title = Les enfants de parents alcooliques.

Within nine years of the Washington discovery, animal studies, including non-human monkey studies carried out at the University of Washington Primate Center by Dr. [[Sterling Clarren]], had confirmed that alcohol was a [[Teratogenesis|teratogen]]. By 1978, 245 cases of FAS had been reported by medical researchers, and the syndrome began to be described as the most frequent known cause of [[intellectual disability]].

While many [[syndrome]]s are [[eponym]]ous, i.e. named after the physician first reporting the association of symptoms, Dr. Smith named FAS after the causal agent of the symptoms.&lt;ref name=foreword&gt;Clarren, S.K. (2005). A thirty year journey from tragedy to hope. Foreword to Buxton, B. (2005). ''Damaged Angels: An Adoptive Mother Discovers the Tragic Toll of Alcohol in Pregnancy''. New York: Carroll &amp; Graf. {{ISBN|0-7867-1550-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He reasoned that doing so would encourage prevention, believing that if people knew maternal alcohol consumption caused the syndrome, then abstinence during pregnancy would follow from [[health education|patient education]] and public awareness.&lt;ref name=foreword/&gt; At the time, nobody was aware of the full range of possible birth defects from FAS or its rate of prevalence.&lt;ref name=foreword/&gt; 
Over time, as subsequent research and clinical experience suggested that a range of effects (including physical, behavioral, and cognitive) could arise from prenatal alcohol exposure, the term [[Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder]] (FASD) was developed to include FAS as well as other conditions resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure.&lt;ref name=foreword/&gt;  Currently, FAS&lt;ref name=IOM/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAE&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Clarren S.K. |author2=Smith D.W. | year = 1978 | title = Fetal alcohol syndrome | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 298 | issue = 19| pages = 1063–1067 | pmid = 347295 | doi=10.1056/NEJM197805112981906}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonesetal1973&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jones K.L. |author2=Smith D.W |author3=Ulleland C.N. |author4=Streissguth A.P. | year = 1973 | title = Pattern of malformation in offspring of chronic alcoholic mothers | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 7815| pages = 1267–1271 | pmid = 4126070 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(73)91291-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the only expression of prenatal alcohol exposure defined by the [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] and assigned [[ICD-9]] and diagnoses.

'''[[World Organisation for Animal Health|World Organization for Animal Health]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oie.int/|title=World Organization for Animal Health|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (historical acronym OIE- the Office International des Epizooties) The OIE originated in 1924 with the ratification of an international agreement of 28 States on January 25, 1924.  The membership currently shown (2017) is 181 members countries.  This is the intergovernmental organization responsible for improving animal health worldwide, and is recognized as a reference organization by the World Trade Organization (WTO).  The headquarters for the OIE are located in Paris.  The objectives of the OIE are to "ensure transparency in the global animal disease situation", to "collect, analyse and disseminate veterinary scientific information", to "encourage international solidarity in the control of animal diseases", to "safeguard world trade by publishing health standards for international trade in animals and animal products", to improve the legal framework and resources of national Veterinary Services", and "to provide a better guarantee of food of animal origin and to promote animal welfare through a science-based approach".

'''[[Food and Agriculture Organization|The Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/home/en/|title=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FAO is an intergovernmental organization of 194 Member Nations, two associate members and one member organization, the European Union, and headquartered in Rome, Italy.  The FAO was initially established as a specialized United Nations agency in 1945 at the first session of FAO conference in Quebec City, Canada.  The main effort of the FAO is to achieve food security for all, and their stated three main goals are: "the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition; the elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all; and, the sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and genetic resources for the benefit of present and future generations."   The FAO creates and shares critical information about food, agriculture and natural resources by identifying and working with different partners with established expertise and facilitating connections.  The FAO has a role in animal health.  High-impact animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease or African swine fevers may not directly affect human health, but they do affect food and nutrition security and livestock production and trade.   A recent successful example has been the global eradication of rinderpest in 2011.  The FAO has animal health programs to establish best practices to prevent and control priority diseases which threaten animal production, public health and trade through its international and regional networks, animal health projects and disseminating practical information.  These programs include:
 
The FAO Emergency Prevention System (EMPRES) Animal Health develops strategies for intervention and improved management.  It works to monitor and give early warning and ultimately to prevent animal diseases.  The EMPRES works to prevent and control diseases at their source.
  
The Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) is FAO's corporate center for the planning and delivery of veterinary assistance to FAO member countries responding to the threat of transboundary animal health crises.

The FAO Food Chain Crisis Management Framework, grouping the three thematic EMPRES, provides an effective, multidisciplinary and coherent approach to threats affecting the food chain by integrating prevention, early warning, preparedness and response.

The Crisis Management Centre-Animal Health (CMC-AH) is FAO's rapid response unit to animal disease emergencies.  The CMC-AH is a joint division of FAO's Animal Production and Health and Emergency and Rehabilitation Divisions, and established in partnership with the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).  The CMC-AH sends rapid response missions to countries to help assess epidemiological situations, diagnose outbreaks of animal diseases, and set up immediate measure to prevent or stop disease spread.

'''[[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]/[[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service|APHIS]]'''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/|title=USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ([[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service|APHIS]]) is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ([[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]), and is the lead agency in an animal disease outbreak.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  APHIS is divided into 6 operational program units, 3 management support units, and 2 offices supporting federal government-wide initiatives. One of the APHIS operational program units is Veterinary Services.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Veterinary Services (VS) The VS protects and improves the health, quality, and marketability of the animals, animal products, and veterinary biologics of the United States by preventing, controlling, and/or eliminating animal diseases, and monitoring, and promoting animal health and productivity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The VS has primary responsibility in a disease outbreak involving domestic livestock and/or poultry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The VS is divided into three operational units:

The Surveillance, Preparedness and Response Services (SPRS) unit manages disease outbreaks (animal health incident management), surveillance programs, animal disease traceability programs, epidemiological investigations, commodity business planning, and [[One Health]] programs. The SPRS also manages the [[Logistics center|Logistics Cente]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r, which includes the National Veterinary Stockpile. Also part of the SPRS is the National Preparedness and Incident Coordination Center (NPIC), which has the responsibility for animal disease traceability, The National Animal Health Emergency Response Corps, the National Veterinary Accreditation Program, and Preparedness and Incident Coordination. The activities of the NPIC include developing and distributing emergency response guidelines based on the National Incident Management System and National Response Framework, developing foreign animal disease preparedness and response plans (FAD PReP), coordinating investigations and disseminating information about foreign animal disease investigations and events, supporting the Secure Food Supply Plans, and managing at the Emergency Management Response System (a web-based information management system that stores data on FAD investigations, animal health incidents, epidemiological tracing, disease surveillance, and intrastate and interstate animal movement.)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The National Import Export Services (NIES) unit manages import and export activities, from setting policy to inspection at ports of entry. NIES manages Animal Import Centers and Port Services, the Agricultural Select Agent Program, and the International Animal Health Standards Services, and operates six service centers, several animal quarantine facilities, and multiple ports of entry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Science, Technology and Analysis Services (STAS) includes the Center for Veterinary Biologics, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories, and the Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health. The STAS provides analysis of response options; animal disease modeling; animal health data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation; animal health surveillance design; diagnostic capability and capacity; economic analysis; national animal health laboratory network coordination; national studies and large scale epidemiological investigations; OIE Collaborating Center; predictive modeling; risk assessments; veterinary biologics approval and monitoring regulatory activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/|title=Department of Homeland Security|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (DHS) The Department of Homeland Security oversees the Office of National Labs (ONL) which includes [[Plum Island Animal Disease Center]] (PIADC), [[National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility]] (NBAF), [[National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center]] (NBACC), and the Chemical Security Analysis Center (CSAC). The DHS veterinary mission compliments the mission of veterinarians in other Federal agencies. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) is the Department of Homeland Security's principal authority for all medical and health issues. The Food, Agriculture, and Veterinary Defense (FAVD) Division within the OHA is the responsible authority for veterinary, food, and agriculture defense. The FAVD programs help government decision-makers protect the health and security of the nation by protecting its animals, plants, and food systems. The OHA and FAVD work with all levels of government and the private sector and in coordination with other DHS components works to help to prevent catastrophic incidents, but if such incidents occur then the OHA assists in coordinating the response and recovery. The DHS provides logistics, operations, and administrative support to assist in response efforts, and coordinate united national responses. All OHA veterinarians work in the Weapons of Mass Destruction – Biodefense (WMD-Bio) Office, which focuses on food and agricultural defense and protection. The Animal Production branch within WMD supports the National Veterinary Stockpile, which is managed by USDA, through its development of end to end planning from risk assessment to countermeasure deployment in order to contain catastrophic animal disease outbreaks. The DHS also supports the efforts of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) which is managed by the USDA and forms part of a nationwide strategy to coordinate the work of all organizations providing animal disease surveillance and testing services. The DHS supports this effort through the DHS management of the Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN) of which the NAHLN is a member. The purpose of the ICLN is to integrate and coordinate response to and consequences from acts of terrorism and other major incidents requiring laboratory surge capabilities, and to strengthen early detection and management of veterinary catastrophic incidents. Many other DHS agencies also support efforts to protect the food, agriculture, and veterinary resources of the U.S. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) has an interagency mission to protect U.S. agriculture from the threat of high consequence foreign animal diseases. DHS is responsible for operational management of PIADC. Since 1954, the PIADC has served as a front line defense against diseases that could devastate U.S. markets for livestock, meat, milk, and other animal products. PIADC is the only laboratory in the nation that can conduct initial diagnostic testing for [[foot-and-mouth disease]] (FMD). The DHS's Science and Technology Directorate takes vaccines developed by ARS, academia, and industry through the regulatory process to develop and license new vaccines and diagnostics for high-threat FADs. Coordinated programs between the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate (DHS) and the Department of Agriculture's [[Agricultural Research Service]] (ARS) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to provide a comprehensive approach for the defense of U.S. agriculture and defense against threats to the nation's health and economy. The Health Threats Resilience Division in the Office of Health Affairs of the DHS manages programs to help DHS and the U.S. to prepare for and respond to chemical and biological threats, as well as other health threats and hazards. Major programs and initiatives include: the National Biosurveillance Integration Center (NBIC), which integrates, analyzes, and distributes key information about health and disease events to ensure well-informed responses to save lives and minimize economic impact to threats and hazards; and state and local initiatives to help bring health care partners into the homeland security conversation to help communities prepare, plan, and respond to the evolving threat landscape.

===African Swine Fever===
'''African Swine Fever''' [[African swine fever virus|African swine fever]] (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease of pigs, endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, with no vaccine or treatment available.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transboundary and Emerging Diseases of Animals|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9846270-5-9|location=Iowa State University, College of Veterinary Medicine, Ames, Iowa 50011|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepigsite.com/pighealth/article/441/african-swine-fever-asf/|title=ThePigSite Pig Health African Swine Fever (ASF)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ASF virus has spread through Georgia (2007) into Russia, then Ukraine, Belarus, and other Eastern European countries, and as of 2015 reports of outbreaks continue, mainly in wild boar.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Mortality can be near-100 percent in some viral strains causing serious viral hemorrhagic disease while others can have more subtle clinical signs and be difficult to identify.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  "With high virulent forms of the virus, ASF is characterized by high fever, loss of appetite, hemorrhages in the skin and internal organs, and death in 2-10 days on average.  Mortality rates may be as high as 100%."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/ASF-EN.pdf|title=African Swine Fever Summary sheets|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ASF virus can be transmitted directly between animals, indirectly via fomites, or by tick vectors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Wild suids such as Warthogs are important to maintaining the virus present (by a natural cycle of transmission between warthogs and the soft tick vector O moubata in Africa,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; but the ASF virus can infect domestic pigs, feral swine, and some members of the wild pig family.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The bite of an infected soft tick or ingestion of warthog tissues can spread the virus from the wildlife reservoirs to domestic pigs, then spread can be continued to pig to pig by blood, the oronasal route by direct contact with infected pigs, or by ingestion of waste food containing unprocessed pig meat or pig meat products.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Other potential routes for spread can be from feeding food waste collected from international airplanes or ships from countries where ASF is found, feral swine movements, the movement of trucks between infected and disease-free areas, and illegal movement of infected pigs or pork products, whether unintentional (e.g., by tourists) or intentional (e.g., meat smuggling).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The risk that the ASF virus can be introduced into the US and North America has increased because of changes in production practices, increasing globalization, and outbreaks of ASF in Europe.  If the virus were to enter the US, control measures must be initiated to prevent the spread of the virus and eliminate it as quickly as possible, of which the primary control and eradication strategy will be depopulation of infected and exposed susceptible animals.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Classical swine fever (hog cholera)===
'''Classical swine fever (hog cholera)'''  [[Classical swine fever]] (CSF), also known as hog cholera, is a highly contagious and economically significant viral disease specific to swine.  The clinical signs of CSF vary from the acute form with generalized disease including high fevers, convulsions, lack of appetite, and high mortality; to the chronic form with similar signs but not as severe as the acute; and to the mild or clinically inapparent form which seldom results in noticeable clinical signs although there may be small litter sizes, stillbirths,and other reproductive failures in addition to high mortality during weaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/fs_classicalswinefever08.pdf|title=Classical Swine Fever|last=|first=|date=August 2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesions of classical swine fever are clinico-pathologically indistinguishable from African swine fever; it is essential to send samples for laboratory confirmation on suspected cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/CLASSICAL_SWINE_FEVER.pdf|title=Classical Swine Fever (hog cholera) Technical disease cards|last=|first=|date=October 2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transmission of the virus is mainly thought to be by the oral or oronasal routes, although can also occur by other mucus membranes and skin abrasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transboundary and Emerging Diseases of Animals|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9846270-5-9|location=Iowa State University, College of Veterinary Medicine, Ames, Iowa 50011|pages=143–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CSF virus can persist in blood and tissues after death, and can be readily spread by feeding uncooked swill that contains tissue from infected pigs.

'''Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists''' ('''GnRH antagonists''') are a class of medications that [[receptor antagonist|antagonize]] the [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor]] (GnRH receptor) and thus the action of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH). They are used in the treatment of [[prostate cancer]], [[endometriosis]], [[uterine fibroids]], [[female infertility]] in [[assisted reproduction]], and for other indications.

Some GnRH antagonists, such as [[cetrorelix]], are similar in structure to natural GnRH (a [[hormone]] made by [[GnRH Neuron|neurons]] in the hypothalamus) but that have an antagonistic effect, while other GnRH antagonists, such as [[elagolix]], are [[non-peptide]] and [[small-molecule]] compounds. GnRH antagonists [[competitive inhibition|compete with natural GnRH for binding]] to GnRH receptors, thus decreasing or blocking GnRH action in the body.

==Medical uses==

===Prostate cancer===
Testosterone promotes growth of many prostate [[tumor]]s and therefore reducing circulating testosterone to very low ([[castration]]) levels is often the treatment goal in the management of men with advanced prostate cancer. GnRH antagonists are used to provide fast suppression of testosterone without the surge in testosterone levels that is seen when treating patients with GnRH agonists.&lt;ref name="Van Poppel Nilsson"/&gt; In patients with advanced disease, this surge in testosterone can lead to a flare-up of the tumour, which can precipitate a range of clinical symptoms such as [[bone pain]], [[urethral obstruction]], and [[spinal cord compression]]. Drug agencies have issued warnings regarding this phenomenon in the prescribing information for GnRH agonists. As testosterone surge does not occur with GnRH antagonists, there is no need for patients to receive an [[antiandrogen]] as flare protection during prostate cancer treatment. GnRH agonists also induce an increase in testosterone levels after each reinjection of the drug&amp;nbsp;– a phenomenon that does not occur with GnRH antagonists.

The reduction in testosterone levels that occurs during GnRH antagonist therapy subsequently reduces the size of the prostate cancer. This in turn results in a reduction in [[prostate-specific antigen]] (PSA) levels in the patient’s blood and so measuring PSA levels is a way to monitor how patients with prostate cancer are responding to treatment. GnRH antagonists have an immediate onset of action leading to a fast and profound suppression of testosterone and are therefore especially valuable in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer, where fast control of disease is needed.

The GnRH antagonist [[abarelix]] was withdrawn from the United States market in 2005 and is now only marketed in Germany for use in patients with symptomatic prostate cancer. [[Degarelix]] is a GnRH antagonist that is approved for use in patients with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer throughout Europe and also in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson J (May 2009). Degarelix: a novel gonadotropin-releasing hormone blocker for the treatment of prostate cancer. Future Oncol. 5: 433-443.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Available forms===
Currently approved GnRH antagonists include the [[peptide]] molecules [[abarelix]], [[cetrorelix]], [[degarelix]], and [[ganirelix]] and the [[small-molecule]] compound [[elagolix]]. GnRH antagonists are administered by [[subcutaneous injection]] (cetrorelix, degarelix, ganirelix), by [[intramuscular injection]] (abarelix), or by [[oral administration]] (elagolix).

Non-peptide and orally-active GnRH antagonists like elagolix that are in development include [[relugolix]] and [[linzagolix]].&lt;ref name="EzzatiCarr2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ezzati|first1=Mohammad|last2=Carr|first2=Bruce R|title=Elagolix, a novel, orally bioavailable GnRH antagonist under investigation for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain|journal=Women's Health|volume=11|issue=1|year=2015|pages=19–28|issn=1745-5057|doi=10.2217/whe.14.68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
As with all hormonal therapies, GnRH antagonists are commonly associated with hormonal side effects such as [[hot flushes]], [[headache]], [[nausea]] and [[weight gain]].&lt;ref name="Serono"&gt;Serono. Cetrotide prescribing information 2009. Accessed 18-6-2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Degarelix"&gt;Degarelix US prescribing information 2008.

Int. 102: 1531-1538.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[abarelix]] (neither of these being GnRH agonists, but instead being antagonists) has been linked with immediate-onset systemic allergic reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Debruyne F, Bhat G, Garnick MB (December 2006). Abarelix for injectable suspension: first-in-class gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist for prostate cancer. Future Oncol. 2: 677-696.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
GnRH antagonists competitively and reversibly bind to GnRH receptors in the [[pituitary gland]], blocking the release of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) from the [[anterior pituitary]].&lt;ref&gt;Broqua P, Riviere PJ, Conn PM, et al (April 2002). Pharmacological profile of a new, potent, and long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist: degarelix. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 301: 95-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engel JB, Schally AV (February 2007). Drug Insight: clinical use of agonists and antagonists of luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone. Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab.: 3: 157-167.&lt;/ref&gt; In men, the reduction in LH subsequently leads to rapid suppression of [[testosterone]] [[biosynthesis|production]] in the [[testes]]; in women it leads to suppression of [[estradiol]] and [[progesterone]] production from the [[ovaries]]. GnRH antagonists are able to abolish [[gonad]]al sex hormone production and to suppress sex hormone levels into the [[castration|castrate]] range, or by approximately 95%.

Unlike the GnRH agonists, which cause an initial stimulation of the [[hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis]] (HPG axis) that leads to a surge in testosterone or estrogen levels, GnRH antagonists have an immediate onset of action and rapidly reduce [[sex hormone]] levels without an initial surge.&lt;ref name="Van Poppel Nilsson"&gt;Van Poppel H, Nilsson S (June 2008). Testosterone surge: rationale for gonadotropin-releasing hormone blockers? Urology 71: 1001-1006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gustofson"&gt;Gustofson RL, Segars JH, Larsen FW (November 2006). Ganirelix acetate causes a rapid reduction in estradiol levels without adversely affecting oocyte maturation in women pretreated with leuprolide acetate who are at risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Hum. Reprod. 21: 2830-2837.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
GnRH antagonists include [[peptide]]s such as [[cetrorelix]] and [[non-peptide]] and [[small-molecule]] compounds such as [[elagolix]]. Peptide GnRH antagonists are [[GnRH analogue]]s.

In the US, the Graduate nurse can [[Nursing practice|practice]] nursing under a Registered nurse. To practice as a Graduate nurse, he or she must have been authorized by the examination provider to sit for the licensured examination and have been provided documentation for their eligibility to take the examination.

The '''Grey Nuns' Hospital''' (also known as '''Hôpital général des frères Charron''') was a [[hospital]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada that operated from 1695 to 1880. It is located south of [[Place d'Youville]] and west of [[Rue Saint-Pierre]].

== History ==
[[File:Maison Mere dYouville.jpg|thumb|left|The building in 2008]]
The name ''Hôpital général des frères Charron'' ({{lang-en|General Hospital of the Frères Charron}}) refers to a [[New France|French]] religious community of the same name. It focused on care of the poor. The hospital was built outside the [[Fortifications of Montreal]] in 1695. Management and hospital administration were entrusted to the [[Grey Nuns]] in 1747.

The hospital suffered a major fire in 1765 and was rebuilt again according to the style of French architecture, that is to say, with large walls composed of rough stone called [[rubble]] that had been squared and covered in plaster. The architecture, which is very utilitarian, is rudimentary and has little ornamentation. The gable roof prevents the accumulation of snow in winter. The structure, being less massive and simpler to build meant a lower risk of fire. Finally, esses are used to reinforce the structure with stems screwed into the wood frame.

In 1880, the nuns decided to rent the building in order to maintain administrative offices in their communities.

In 1971, the Grey Nuns decided to return to their first mother-house. Major renovations of the building were undertaken.

The site was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|9651|Grey Nuns' Hospital National Historic Site of Canada|29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns initially pursued a career in general surgery, and for five years he was a consultant surgeon at the [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]].&lt;ref name="Scot gov"/&gt; He took up a managerial role as the Medical Director of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary.&lt;ref name="Scot gov"/&gt; He completed a master's degree in Public Health in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/healthwellbeing/research/publichealth/about|title=Research: Public Health: About us|publisher=[[University of Glasgow]]|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as deputy director of planning and contracts at Greater Glasgow in 1992, becoming the Director of [[public health]] for Greater Glasgow the following year.&lt;ref name="BBC Jun2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4120522.stm|title=Chief medical officer appointed|date=22 June 2005|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 he was awarded a visiting professorship in public health medicine at the [[University of Glasgow]], and he also became a senior research fellow in the ''School of Business and Management'' at the university.&lt;ref name="Scot gov"/&gt;

He took up the post of Chief Medical Officer for Scotland on 5 September 2005. In 2007 his second annual report emphasised the importance of the early years as the basis for health and wellbeing in adulthood.&lt;ref name="BBC Nov2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7103403.stm|title=Action call to bridge health gap|work=BBC News|date=20 November 2007|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was co-chair of the Scottish Government's Early Years Taskforce&lt;ref name="Wave profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wavetrust.org/about-us/our-people/professor-sir-harry-burns|title=About us: Our people: Professor Sir Harry Burns|publisher=Wave trust|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was set up in 2011. Burns helped Scotland conceptualise health improvement differently, being aware that the small gains that resulted from a range of interventions can add up to produce significant overall improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g2262|title=Harry Burns: the man who shifted Scotland’s thinking on health|first=Bryan|last=Christie|journal=[[BMJ]]|date=21 March 2014|volume=348|pages=g2262 |doi=10.1136/bmj.g2262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 it was announced that Burns would step down as Chief Medical Officer in April 2014 to take up the appointment of Professor of global public health at [[Strathclyde University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Harry Burns to step down as chief medical officer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-25847844|accessdate=23 January 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in Renfrewshire’s Tackling Poverty Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renfrewshire.gov.uk/webcontent/home/Services/Community+and+living/Tackling_Poverty|title=Tackling Poverty|publisher=[[Renfrewshire Council]]|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, it was announced that Burns would join the Scottish Government's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) to help look at the issue of inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/301764-sturgeon-london-brings-benefits-and-challenges-to-scotlands-economy|title=Sturgeon: London brings benefits and challenges to Scotland's economy|work=STV News|date=1 December 2014|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the Scottish Government announced that he would chair an independent review of targets in Scotland's NHS, with an initial report and recommendations expected in spring 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37318461 |title=Former chief medical officer to lead NHS targets review |work=BBC News |date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Burns was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from University of Strathclyde in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.strath.ac.uk/press/newsreleases/2008/headline_136449_en.html|title=Honorary degrees for distinguished four|publisher=[[University of Strathclyde]]|date=7 May 2008|accessdate=20 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003131137/http://www.strath.ac.uk/press/newsreleases/2008/headline_136449_en.html|archivedate=3 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]] in recognition of outstanding achievement and service to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=59808|date=11 June 2011|page=1|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_197792.pdf|title=Birthday Honours List 2011|publisher=Directgov|date=11 June 2011|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_197792.pdf|archivedate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His significant contribution to public life was also recognised by [[East Renfrewshire Council]], who awarded him their highest honour, by making him an [[Freedom of the City|honorary freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra.co.uk/news/local-headlines/three-are-free-in-er-gong-awards-1-1720832|title=Three are Free in ER gong awards|work=The Extra|publisher=[[Johnston Press]]|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Nicola Sturgeon]] presented Burns with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the ''[[Holyrood Magazine]]''-launched first Scottish Public Service Awards, recognising his lasting contributions to public service in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/interviews/interview-sir-harry-burns|title=Interview with Sir Harry Burns|first=Katie|last=Mackintosh|work=[[Holyrood (magazine)|Holyrood]]|date=25 December 2014|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6292">Because of the large structural diversity and extensive [[metabolism]] of dietary [[polyphenols]], their fate [[in vivo]] and possible health effects remain undetermined as of the early [[21st century]].&lt;ref name="lpi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids|title=Flavonoids|publisher=Linus Pauling Institute, Micronutrient Information Center, Oregon State University|date=2015|access-date=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although polyphenols are speculated to be part of the health-promoting effects of consuming fruits and vegetables, no evidence exists to date that dietary polyphenols actually provide health benefits.&lt;ref name="EFSA"&gt;{{cite journal|author=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA)2, 3 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Parma, Italy|url=https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1489 |title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to various food(s)/food constituent(s) and protection of cells from premature aging, antioxidant activity, antioxidant content and antioxidant properties, and protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/20061|journal= EFSA Journal|year= 2010|volume= 8|issue=2|page=1489|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=delrio/&gt;

== Bioavailability ==
Polyphenols have poor [[bioavailability]], indicating that most of what are consumed are extensively metabolized and excreted.&lt;ref name="lpi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ajcn"/&gt; [[Gallic acid]] and [[isoflavone]]s may show absorption of about 5%,&lt;ref name="lpi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ajcn"/&gt; with amounts of catechins ([[flavan-3-ol]]s), [[flavanone]]s, and [[quercetin]] glucosides even less.&lt;ref name="lpi"/&gt; The least well-absorbed phenols are the [[proanthocyanidin]]s, galloylated tea catechins, and [[anthocyanin]]s.&lt;ref name="ajcn"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manach C, Williamson G, Morand C, Scalbert A, Rémésy C | title = Bioavailability and bioefficacy of polyphenols in humans. I. Review of 97 bioavailability studies | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 81 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = 230S-242S | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15640486 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/81.1.230S | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/81/1/230S.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cardiovascular health ==
A review published in 2013 found insufficient consensus for the hypothesis that the specific intake of food and drink containing [[flavonoid]]s may play a meaningful role in reducing the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]]s.&lt;ref name="delrio"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Rio D, Rodriguez-Mateos A, Spencer JP, Tognolini M, Borges G, Crozier A | title = Dietary (poly)phenolics in human health: structures, bioavailability, and evidence of protective effects against chronic diseases | journal = Antioxidants &amp; Redox Signaling | volume = 18 | issue = 14 | pages = 1818–92 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 22794138 | pmc = 3619154 | doi = 10.1089/ars.2012.4581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewers stated that research to date had been of poor quality and that large and rigorous [[clinical trial]]s are needed to define health benefits and to reveal [[adverse event]]s from excessive polyphenol intake.&lt;ref name=delrio/&gt; Currently, lack of knowledge about safety suggests that polyphenol levels should not exceed the intake of a normal diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Habauzit V, Morand C | title = Evidence for a protective effect of polyphenols-containing foods on cardiovascular health: an update for clinicians | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Chronic Disease | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–106 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 23251771 | pmc = 3513903 | doi = 10.1177/2040622311430006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary research on the association of consuming polyphenol foods, such as [[olive oil]], [[soy]], and [[pomegranate]] products, with lower risk of cardiovascular diseases has been low in quality, with little evidence of any possible benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marx W, Kelly J, Marshall S, Nakos S, Campbell K, Itsiopoulos C | title = The Effect of Polyphenol-Rich Interventions on Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Haemodialysis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = Nutrients | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29232891 | pmc = 5748795 | doi = 10.3390/nu9121345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = George ES, Marshall S, Mayr HL, Trakman GL, Tatucu-Babet OA, Lassemillante AM, Bramley A, Reddy AJ, Forsyth A, Tierney AC, Thomas CJ, Itsiopoulos C, Marx W | title = The effect of high-polyphenol extra virgin olive oil on cardiovascular risk factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | pages = 1–138 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29708409 | doi = 10.1080/10408398.2018.1470491 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antioxidant activity ==
As interpreted by the [[Linus Pauling Institute]]&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; and the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA),&lt;ref name="EFSA"/&gt; dietary [[flavonoid]]s have little or no direct [[antioxidant]] food value following digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams RJ, Spencer JP, Rice-Evans C | title = Flavonoids: antioxidants or signalling molecules? | journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 838–49 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15019969 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2004.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike controlled test tube conditions where antioxidant effects may result when high concentrations of flavonoids are used, the fate of ingested flavonoids [[in vivo]] shows they are poorly conserved (less than 5%), with most of what is absorbed existing as chemically-modified metabolites destined for rapid excretion.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;

[[File:Saffron gatherersSantorini-3.jpg|thumb|Saffron crocus flowers, represented as small red tufts, are gathered by two women in a fragmentary Minoan fresco from the excavation of Akrotiri on the Aegean island of Santorini.]]

&lt;!--PLEASE USE BRITISH ENGLISH THROUGHOUT THIS ARTICLE.--&gt;
Human [[Horticulture|cultivation]] and use of [[saffron]] spans more than 3,500 years{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Hogan|2007}} and extends across cultures, [[continents]], and civilizations. Saffron, a spice derived from the dried [[carpel|stigmas]] of the saffron [[crocus]] (''Crocus sativus''), has through history remained among the world's most costly substances. With its bitter taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes, the [[carotenoid|apocarotenoid]]-rich saffron has been used as a seasoning, fragrance, [[dye]], and [[medicine]].

The saffron crocus is a genetically monomorphic clone{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-López|Gómez-Gómez|Ahrazem|2009}} native to [[Southwest Asia]];{{Sfn|Grigg|1974|p=287}}{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=272}} it was probably first cultivated in or near [[Persia]]&lt;ref&gt;McGee, H. (2004), On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen, Scribner, {{ISBN|978-0-684-80001-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}} The wild precursor of domesticated saffron crocus was likely ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'', which originated in [[Crete]] and Greece;{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-López|Gómez-Gómez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''[[Crocus thomasii|C.&amp;nbsp;thomasii]]'' and ''[[Crocus pallasii|C.&amp;nbsp;pallasii]]'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} The saffron crocus is now a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is "self-incompatible" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant meiosis and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction—all propagation is by vegetative multiplication via manual "divide-and-set" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30–31}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} If ''C.&amp;nbsp;sativus'' is a mutant form of ''C.&amp;nbsp;cartwrightianus'', then it may have emerged via [[plant breeding]], which would have selected for elongated stigmas, in late [[Bronze Age]] Crete.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=1}}

Humans may have [[plant breeding|bred]] ''C.&amp;nbsp;cartwrightianus'' specimens by screening for specimens with abnormally long stigmas. The resulting saffron crocus was documented in a 7th-century BC [[Assyria]]n botanical reference compiled under [[Ashurbanipal]],{{Sfn|Russo|Dreher|Mathre|2003|p=6}} and it has since been [[Trade and use of saffron|traded and used]] over the course of four millennia and has been used as treatment for some ninety disorders.{{Sfn|Honan|2004}} The ''C.&amp;nbsp;sativus'' clone was slowly propagated throughout much of [[Eurasia]], later reaching parts of North [[Africa]], [[North America]], and [[Oceania]]. Global production on a by-mass basis is now dominated by [[Iran]], which accounts for some 90% of the annual harvest.{{Sfn|Ghorbani|2008|p=1}}

==Etymology==
It immediately stems from the Latin word ''{{Lang|la|safranum}}'' via the 12th-century Old French term ''[[wikt:safran#French|safran]]''. The French was borrowed from Arabic [[wikt:زعفران#Arabic|زَعْفَرَان]] (''za'farān''), and ultimately from [[Persian language|Persian]] word "zarparan" which literally means "yellow stigmas".

The [[Latin]] form ''{{Lang|la|safranum}}'' is also the source of the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] ''[[wikt:safrà#Catalan|safrà]]'', [[Italy|Italian]] ''[[wikt:zafferano#Italian|zafferano]]'',{{Sfn|Harper|2001}} but [[Portugal|Portuguese]]'' [[wikt:açafrão#Portuguese|açafrão]]'', and [[Spain|Spanish]] ''[[wikt:azafrán#Spanish|azafrán]]'' come from the Arabic ''az-zaferán''.

The Latin term ''crocus'' is certainly a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[loanword]]. It is adapted from the [[Aramaic]] form ''kurkema'' via the Arabic term ''kurkum'' and the Greek intermediate κρόκος ''krokos'', which once again signifies "yellowish".{{Sfn|Klein|1987|p=287}}{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} The Sanskrit ''kunkumam'' might be ultimately the origin, or in some way related to the Semitic term.{{Sfn|Harper|2001}}

==Minoan and Greco-Roman==
[[File:Man gathering saffron Knossos Crete crocus sativus fresco.jpg|thumb|This inaccurate{{Sfn|Hood|1992|pp=48–49}}{{Sfn|Platon|1947|pp=505–506}} reconstruction of a Minoan fresco from Knossos in Crete depicts a man, which should be a monkey, gathering the crocus harvest.]]

''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'' is a species of flowering plant in the family [[Iridaceae]], native to Greece and Crete. ''C.&amp;nbsp;cartwrightianus'' is the presumed wild progenitor of the domesticated triploid ''Crocus sativus'' – the saffron crocus.{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003}} Saffron is the triploid form of a species found in Eastern Greece, ''Crocus cartwrightianus''; it probably appeared first in Crete. An origin in Western or Central Asia, although often suspected, has been disproved by botanical research.{{Sfn|Mathew|1977}}

Saffron played a significant role in the Greco-Roman pre-classical period bracketed by the 8th century BC and the 3rd century AD.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=41}} The first known image of saffron in pre-Greek culture is much older and stems from the [[Bronze Age]]. A saffron harvest is shown in the [[Knossos]] palace frescoes of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]],{{Sfn|Hogan|2007|p=3}} which depict the flowers being picked by young girls and [[monkey]]s. One of these fresco sites is located in the "Xeste 3" building at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]], on the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] island of [[Santorini]]—the ancient Greeks knew it as "Thera". These frescoes likely date from the 16th{{Sfn|Honan|2004}} or 17th century BC{{Sfn|Dalby|2002|p=124}} but may have been produced anywhere between 3000 and 1100&amp;nbsp;BC.{{Sfn|Ferrence|Bendersky|2004}} They portray a Minoan goddess supervising the plucking of [[flower]]s and the gleaning of [[Stigma (botany)|stigmas]] for use in the manufacture of what is possibly a therapeutic drug.{{Sfn|Ferrence|Bendersky|2004}} A fresco from the same site also depicts a woman using saffron to treat her bleeding foot.{{Sfn|Honan|2004}} These "Theran" frescoes are the first botanically accurate visual representations of saffron's use as an herbal remedy.{{Sfn|Ferrence|Bendersky|2004}} This saffron-growing Minoan settlement was ultimately destroyed by a powerful earthquake and subsequent [[Minoan eruption|volcanic eruption]] sometime between 1645 and 1500 BC. The volcanic ash from the destruction entombed and helped preserve these key herbal frescoes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=37–38}}

{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|width=100|image1=Crocus sativus sahuran.jpg|image2=Crocus sativus1.jpg|caption2=&lt;center&gt;''C. sativus.''&lt;/center&gt;}}

Ancient Greek legends tell of brazen sailors embarking on long and perilous voyages to the remote land of [[Cilicia]], where they traveled to procure what they believed was the world's most valuable saffron.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2–3}} The best-known Hellenic saffron legend is that of Crocus and [[Smilax]]: The handsome youth Crocus sets out in pursuit of the nymph Smilax in the woods near Athens; in a brief dallying interlude of idyllic love, Smilax is flattered by his amorous advances, but all too soon tires of his attentions. He continues his pursuit; she resists. She bewitches Crocus: he is transformed—into a saffron crocus. Its radiant orange stigmas were held as a relict glow of an undying and unrequited passion.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=2}} The tragedy and the spice would be recalled later:

{{Quote|text=Crocus and Smilax may be turn'd to flow'rs,&lt;br /&gt;And the Curetes spring from bounteous show'rs&lt;br /&gt;I pass a hundred legends stale, as these,&lt;br /&gt;And with sweet novelty your taste to please.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=1}} |author= [[Ovid]] |source=''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''.}}

For the ancient Mediterraneans, saffron gathered around the Cilician coastal town of [[Soli, Cilicia|Soli]] was of top value, particularly for use in perfumes and ointments. [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], however, rated rival [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n saffron from the Fertile Crescent as best—to treat gastrointestinal or renal upsets.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=41}} Greek saffron from the [[Corycian Cave]] of [[Mount Parnassus]] was also of note:{{Sfn|Cairns|2006|p=133}} the color offered by the Corycian crocus is used as a benchmark in the [[Argonautica]] of [[Apollonius Rhodius]]{{refn|{{Gutenberg|no=830|name=Argonautica of Apollonius Rhodius|bullet=none}}.|group=N}} and similarly with its fragrance in the epigrams of [[Martial]].{{Sfn|Francese|2007|p=162}}

[[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] of late [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] used a quarter-cup of saffron in her warm baths, as she prized its colouring and cosmetic properties. She used it before encounters with men, trusting that saffron would render lovemaking yet more pleasurable.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=55}} Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments: when stomach pains progressed to internal hemorrhaging, an Egyptian treatment consisted of saffron crocus seeds mixed and crushed together with ''aager''-tree remnants, ox fat, [[coriander]], and [[myrrh]]. This ointment or [[poultice]] was applied to the body. The physicians expected it to "[expel] blood through the mouth or rectum which resembles hog's blood when it is cooked".{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=34–35}} Urinary tract conditions were also treated with an oil-based emulsion of premature saffron flowers mixed with roasted beans; this was used topically on men. Women ingested a more complex preparation.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=35}}

In Greco-Roman times saffron was widely traded across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians. Their customers ranged from the perfumers of [[Rosetta]], in Egypt, to physicians in Gaza to townsfolk in Rhodes, who wore pouches of saffron in order to mask the presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=58}} For the Greeks, saffron was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as the ''[[hetaera]]e''. Large dye works operating in [[Sidon]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] used saffron baths as a substitute; there, royal robes were ''triple''-dipped in deep purple dyes; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners, the last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip, which gave a less intense purple hue.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=59}}

The ancient Greeks and Romans prized saffron as a perfume or deodoriser and scattered it about their public spaces: royal halls, courts, and amphitheatres alike. When [[Nero]] entered Rome they spread saffron along the streets; wealthy Romans partook of daily saffron baths. They used it as [[mascara]], stirred saffron threads into their wines, cast it aloft in their halls and streets as a [[potpourri]], and offered it to their deities. Roman colonists took saffron with them when they settled in southern Roman Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 [[Crisis of the Third Century|barbarian invasion of Italy]]. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century Moors or with the [[Avignon Papacy]] in the 14th century.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=63}}

==Middle Eastern and Persian==

Saffron-based pigments have been found in the prehistoric paints used to illustrate beasts in 50,000-year-old cave art found in modern-day Iraq, which was even then northwest of the Persian Empire.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=2}}{{Sfn|Humphries|1998|p=20}} The Sumerians used saffron as an ingredient in their remedies and magical potions. Sumerians did not cultivate saffron. They gathered their stores from wild flowers, believing that divine intervention alone enables saffron's medicinal properties.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=12}} Such evidence suggests that saffron was an article of long-distance trade before Crete's Minoan palace culture reached a peak in the 2nd millennium BC. Saffron was also honoured as a sweet-smelling spice over three millennia ago in the Hebrew [[Tanakh]]:

{{Quote|text=Your lips drop sweetness like honeycomb, my bride, syrup and milk are under your tongue, and your dress had the scent of Lebanon. Your cheeks are an orchard of pomegranates, an orchard full of rare fruits, [[spikenard]] and saffron, sweet cane and cinnamon.{{Sfn|Humphries|1998|p=19}} |source=''[[Song of Solomon]]'' }}

[[File:Saffron Field.JPG|thumb|left|A field of saffron crocuses in Iran]]
In ancient Persia, saffron (''Crocus sativus'' 'Hausknechtii') was cultivated at [[Derbent|Derbena]] and [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] in the 10th century BC. There, Persian saffron threads have been found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=2}} Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities, and as a brilliant yellow dye, perfume, and a medicine. Thus, saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Indeed, Persian saffron threads, used to spice foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an [[aphrodisiac]]. These fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=41}} In addition, Persian saffron was dissolved in water with [[sandalwood]] to use as a body wash after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=17–18}} Later, Persian saffron was heavily used by [[Alexander the Great]] and his forces during their Asian campaigns. They mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice. Alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water, taking after [[Cyrus the Great]]. Much like Cyrus, he believed it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment. He even recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron's perceived curative properties, continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=54–55}}

==East and South Asian==
[[File:Gomateswara.jpg|thumb|The [[Gomateshwara]] monolith is anointed with saffron every twelve years by thousands of devotees during the [[Mahamastakabhisheka]].]]

Various conflicting accounts exist that describe saffron's first arrival in South and East Asia. The first of these rely on historical accounts gleaned from Persian records. These suggest to many experts that saffron, among other spices, was first spread to India via Persian rulers' efforts to stock their newly built gardens and parks. They accomplished this by transplanting the desired cultivars across the Persian empire.{{Sfn|Dalby|2003|p=256}} Phoenicians then began in the 6th century BC to market the new Kashmiri saffron by utilising their extensive trade routes. Once sold, Kashmiri saffron was used in the treatment of melancholy and as a fabric dye.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=41}}

On the other hand, traditional Kashmiri legend states that saffron first arrived in the 11th or 12th century AD, when two foreign and itinerant [[Sufism|Sufi]] ascetics, Khwaja Masood Wali and Hazrat Sheikh Shariffudin, wandered into Kashmir. The foreigners, having fallen sick, beseeched a cure for illness from a local tribal chieftain. When the chieftain obliged, the two holy men reputedly gave them a saffron crocus bulb as payment and thanks. To this day, grateful prayers are offered to the two saints during the saffron harvesting season in late autumn. The saints, indeed, have a golden-domed shrine and tomb dedicated to them in the saffron-trading village of [[Pampore]], India. However, the Kashmiri poet and scholar Mohammed Yusuf Teng disputes this. He states that Kashmiris had cultivated saffron for more than two millennia. According to Hindu religion Lord Krishna used to put Tilak (a mark on forehead) of Saffron daily. 

Ancient Chinese Buddhist accounts from the ''mula-[[sarvastivadin]]''{{Sfn|Fotedar|1999|p=128}} monastic order (or ''[[vinaya]]'') present yet another account of saffron's arrival in India. According to legend, an ''[[arhat]]'' Indian Buddhist missionary by the name of Madhyântika (or Majjhantika) was sent to Kashmir in the 5th century BC. Upon his arrival he seemingly sowed the first Kashmiri saffron crop.{{Sfn|Dalby|2002|p=95}} From there, saffron use spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. In addition to use in foods, saffron stigmas were also soaked in water to yield a golden-yellow solution that was used as a fabric dye.

Some historians believe that saffron first came to China with Mongol invaders by way of Persia. Saffron is mentioned in the ancient Chinese medical text ''[[Shennong Ben Cao Jing]]'', believed to be from the 3rd century AD (but attributed to mythological emperor [[Shennong]]). Yet the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance. The Chinese medical expert Wan Zhen wrote that "[t]he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha". Wan reflected on how saffron was used in his time: "The [saffron crocus] flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained. It is valued for its uniform yellow colour. It can be used to aromatise wine."{{Sfn|Dalby|2002|p=95}}

In modern times saffron cultivation has spread to Afghanistan due to the efforts of the European Union and the United Kingdom. Together they promote saffron cultivation among impoverished and cash-strapped Afghan farmers as an ideal alternative to lucrative—and illicit—[[opium]] production.{{Sfn|Pearce|2005}}

==Post-Classical European==
[[File:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|Medieval European [[illuminated manuscript]]s, such as this 13th-century depiction of Archbishop of Canterbury [[Thomas Becket]]'s assassination, often used saffron dyes to provide hues of yellow and orange.]]

Saffron cultivation in Europe declined steeply following the fall of the Roman Empire. For several centuries thereafter, saffron cultivation was rare or non-existent throughout Europe. This was reversed when Moorish civilisation spread from North Africa to settle [[Al-Andalus|the Iberian peninsula]] as well as parts of France and southern Italy. One theory states that Moors reintroduced saffron corms to the region around [[Poitiers]] after they lost the [[Battle of Tours]] to [[Charles Martel]] in AD 732.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=70}} Two centuries after their conquest of Spain, Moors planted saffron throughout the southern provinces of [[Andalucia]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], La Mancha, and Valencia.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=70}}

In [[France]], saffron cultivation probably started during the 13th century.{{Sfn|Lachaud|2012|p=63}} Crocus sativus was likely introduced from Spain and from the Middle-East by pilgrims, merchants, and Knights. Its first uses are documented in the south-west of the Kingdom around 1250.{{Sfn|Lachaud|2012|p=63}} It is indeed unlikely that Kings and Religious didn't try growing Crocus sativus by that time: Saffron was rare, expensive, and demanded, and Crocus sativus could be farmed under France's latitudes.{{Sfn|Lachaud|2012|p=63}} By the 14th century, the wide use of saffron for spicing and coloring food is documented in recipe books such as the "[[Le Viandier|Viandier de Taillevent]]", written by the King's cook.{{Sfn|Lachaud|2012|p=63}} And by the 15th century, local saffron farming is attested with taxes levied by the religious power, which reveal how important saffron crops must have been. For instance, in 1478, the saffron tax levied by the Bishop of [[Albi]] reached 1/12th of saffron production.{{Sfn|Lachaud|2012|p=63}}

Saffron demand ''skyrocketed'' when the [[Black Death]] of 1347–1350 struck Europe. It was coveted by plague victims for medicinal purposes, and yet many of the farmers capable of growing it had died off. Large quantities of non-European saffron were therefore imported.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=99}} The finest saffron threads from Muslim lands were unavailable to Europeans because of hostilities stoked by the Crusades, so Rhodes and other places were key suppliers to central and northern Europe. Saffron was one of the contested points of hostility that flared between the declining landed gentry and upstart and increasingly wealthy merchants. The fourteen-week-long "Saffron War" was ignited when one {{Convert|800|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} shipment of saffron was hijacked and stolen by nobles.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=99}} The load, which was en route to the town of [[Basel]], would at today's market prices be valued at more than {{USD}}500,000.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=100}} That shipment ''was'' eventually returned, but the wider 13th–century trade was subject to mass piracy. Thieves plying Mediterranean waters would often ignore gold stores and instead steal Venetian- and Genoan-marketed saffron bound for Europe. Wary of such unpleasantness, Basel planted its own corms. Several years of large and lucrative saffron harvests made Basel extremely prosperous compared to other European towns. Citizens sought to protect their status by outlawing the transport of corms out of the town; guards were posted to prevent thieves from picking flowers or digging up corms. Yet ten years later the saffron harvest had waned. Basel abandoned the crop.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=101}}

The pivot of central European saffron trade moved to Nuremberg. The merchants of Venice continued their rule of the Mediterranean sea trade, trafficking varieties from Sicily, France and Spain, Austria, Crete and Greece, and the Ottoman Empire. Adulterated goods also made the rounds: those soaked in honey, mixed with marigold petals, or kept in damp cellars—all to add quick and cheap bulk. Irritated Nuremberg authorities passed the ''Safranschou'' code to de-louse the saffron trade.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102–103}} Adulterators were thus fined, imprisoned, and executed—by immolation.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=103–104}} England was next to have its turn as a major producer. One theory{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=110}} has it that the crop spread to the coastal regions of eastern England in the 14th century AD during the reign of Edward III. In subsequent years saffron was fleetingly cultivated throughout England. Norfolk, Suffolk, and south [[Cambridgeshire]] were especially affected with corms. [[Rowland Parker]] provides an account of its cultivation in the village of [[Foxton, Cambridgeshire|Foxton]] during the 16th and 17th centuries, "usually by people holding a small amount of land"; an acre planted in saffron could yield a crop worth a kingly {{GBP}}6, making it "a very profitable crop, provided that plenty of unpaid labor was available; unpaid labor was one of the basic features of farming then and for another two centuries."{{Sfn|Parker|1976|p=138}}

In France, saffron production became very important in the 17th and 18th centuries, reaching a few tons.{{Sfn|Lachaud|2012|p=64}} By then, saffron farming had spread throughout the entire Kingdom. Saffron was especially grown in [[Albigeois]], [[Angoumois]], [[Gascony]], [[Gâtinais]], [[Normandy]], [[Périgord]], [[Poitou]], [[Provence]], and [[Quercy]].{{Sfn|Lachaud|2012|p=64}} Its mysterious decline started during the 18th century, possibly due to pandemic fungal diseases destroying bulbs and crops, to particularly cold winters, and to competing market from the Mediterranean countries.{{Sfn|Lachaud|2012|p=64}}

In England, cultivation ''persisted'' only in the light, well-drained, and chalk-based soils of the north Essex countryside. The Essex town of [[Saffron Walden]] got its name as a saffron growing and trading centre; its name was originally Cheppinge Walden, and the culinary name change was effected to punctuate the importance of the crop to the townsfolk; the town's arms still feature blooms from the eponymous crocus.{{refn|[http://www.saffronwalden.gov.uk/regalia.php Image] at the town council website of [[Saffron Walden]].|group=N}} Yet as England emerged from the Middle Ages, rising puritanical sentiments and new conquests abroad endangered English saffron's use and cultivation. Puritanical partisans favoured increasingly austere, unadorned, and unspiced foods. Saffron was also a labor-intensive crop, which became an increasing disadvantage as wages and time opportunity costs rose. And finally, an influx of more exotic spices from the far East due to the resurgent [[spice trade]] meant that the English, as well as other Europeans, had many more—and cheaper—seasonings to dally over.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=117}}

This trend was documented by the [[Dean of Manchester]], Reverend [[William Herbert (botanist)|William Herbert]]. He collected samples and compiled information on many aspects of the saffron crocus.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=132}} He was concerned about the steady decline in saffron cultivation over the course of the 17th century and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution; the introduction in Europe of easily grown [[maize]] and [[potato]]es, which steadily took over lands formerly flush with corms, did not help.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=133}} In addition, the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such intriguing new arrivals as [[chocolate]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], and [[vanilla]]. Only in the south of France or in Italy and Spain, where the saffron harvest was culturally primal, did significant cultivation prevail.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=133}}

==North American==

Saffron made its way to the New World when thousands of Alsatian, German, and Swiss [[Anabaptist]]s, [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Dunkards]], and others fled religious persecution in Europe.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=134–136}} They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the [[Susquehanna River]] valley.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=136}} These settlers, who became known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to America—in a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the [[Schwenkfelder Church]]. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=143}} Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=138}}

However the [[War of 1812]] destroyed many of the merchantmen that ferried American saffron abroad. Pennsylvanian saffron growers were afterwards left with surplus inventory, and trade with the Caribbean markets never recovered.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=138–139}} Nevertheless, Pennsylvania Dutch growers developed many uses for the now abundant saffron in their own home cooking—cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=142–146}} Saffron cultivation survived into modern times principally in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=143}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported by military, [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]], and civilian researchers. Over 200,000 military personnel are members of the cohort. The Millennium Cohort Study began with a random sample of US Military members including active duty, Reserve, and [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] members from all services. Surveys are sent to this representative sample of US military personnel every three years through email and the United States Postal Service, requesting that they submit their data online or via the mail service. Approximately 25% of Millennium Cohort participants have left military service and the study will continue to follow all participants through their Active duty, Reserve, National Guard careers and civilian endeavors.

'''Minnie Cumnock Blodgett''' (1862&amp;ndash;1931) graduated from [[Vassar College]] in 1884, later becoming a trustee (1917&amp;ndash;1931). She is the mother of Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20), who was also a Vassar trustee (1942&amp;ndash;1954), and was chairman of the Board (1945&amp;ndash;1952).&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1928/1928-blodgett.html |title= The Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics was completed, York &amp; Sawyer, architects. -  - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu/ |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband, [[John W. Blodgett]], built their estate, which they named [[John W. Blodgett Estate|Brookby]], where they made their Grand Rapids home.

==Vassar College and Euthenics program==
After [[Ellen Swallow Richards]]' death in 1911, [[Julia Lathrop]] (1858&amp;ndash;1932), another of Vassar's most distinguished alumnae, continued to promote the development of an interdisciplinary program in [[euthenics]] at the college.  Lathrop soon teamed with alumna Minnie Cumnock Blodgett, who with her husband, John Wood Blodgett, offered financial support to create a program of euthenics at [[Vassar College]].  Curriculum planning, suggested by Vassar President [[Henry Noble MacCracken]] in 1922, began in earnest by 1923.&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |title=The Disappointing First Thrust of Euthenics |author=Vassar Historian |date= |website=vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127020842/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |archivedate=27 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, through a gift of $550,000.00 from Mrs. Blodgett, the Institute of Euthenics was founded at Vassar.  Its aim was "to supply scientific knowledge of the complex problems of adjustment between individuals and the environment, emphasizing home and family."&lt;ref name="NYTimesObituary"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D1EFC395F177A93C6A8178BD95F458385F9 |title= SOCIAL WORKER DIES AT 68 ON VISIT HERE - Mrs. John W.

Their intention was to bring into the curriculum of the College a course of study specifically designed around the ideas of Ellen Swallow Richards."

==Death==
Mrs. John Wood Blodgett died suddenly of heart disease on October 13, 1931 in her suite in [[The St. Regis Hotel]], New York, NY.  She was there to attend meetings for two health organizations and spend some time visiting her daughter and son-in-law.  According to her obituary in the ''New York Times'', she was a director of  the Child Study Association, the National Organization for Public Health Nursing, and was a member of the National Committee on Mental Hygiene. She was the daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs. Alexander G. Cunnock [sic] of Lowell, Mass. She was also president of the D.A. Blodgett Home for Children, and sat on the board of trustees at Vassar College.&lt;ref name="NYTimesObituary" /&gt;

'''National Farm Safety &amp; Health Week''' is a week of commemoration, recognized annually on the third week of September in the United States.

==Origins==
In 1944, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed the first proclamation for [[Agricultural safety and health|farm safety]] due to the high injury rate in agriculture. Agriculture is one of the most hazardous industries with a death rate of 23.2 deaths per 100,000 workers annually according to U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in 2013.&lt;ref name="extension"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.extension.iastate.edu/article/farm-safety-and-health-week-sept-20-26|title=Farm Safety and Health Week Is Sept. 20-26 {{!}} Iowa State University Extension and Outreach|website=www.extension.iastate.edu|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many injuries are preventable through education. Serious injuries and death can be prevented by cautiously approaching field adjustments or repairs, taking precautions to avoid slips and falls, making smart decisions while assigning tasks to youth, using and maintaining the slow moving vehicle emblem correctly, and retrofitting tractors with rollover structures.&lt;ref name="extension" /&gt;

==History==
In September 2015, [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] gave an official proclamation to accentuate the importance of agriculture for our society and economy as well as affirm farm safety and health programs 
"America's farmers and ranchers have played a critical role in shaping our progress and forging a better future for coming generations. Through centuries of hard work, they have supplied our Nation with products and services essential to the economic and physical well-being of our society.
"Across our country, those who work on farms bolster our economy and nourish our people by providing what we need at a most human level, helping to uphold America's founding creed: Out of many, we are one. This week, let us recognize the steadfast dedication and commitment of agricultural producers and their families, and let us reaffirm our resolve to promote their health and safety."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/21/presidential-proclamation-national-farm-safety-and-health-week-2015|title=Presidential Proclamation -- National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2015|date=2015-09-18|newspaper=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the development and dissemination of National Farm Safety &amp; Health Week materials shifted from the [[National Safety Council]] to National Education Center for Ag Safety (NECAS). NECAS is the agricultural partner for the [[National Safety Council]] and has been serving the agricultural family and business community since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agsafety.osu.edu/newsletter/ag-safety-stat/september-2015/announcements/national-farm-safety-and-health-week|title=National Farm Safety and Health Week {{!}} Agricultural Safety &amp; Health Program|website=agsafety.osu.edu|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year they provide farmers with programs and materials to promote farmer safety and health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.necasag.org/aboutnecas/nationalfarmsafetyandhealthweek2016/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''Prion diseases''' comprise [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (CJD), [[Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome]], [[fatal familial insomnia]] and related disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Prion diseases of humans and animals: their causes and molecular basis. Collinge J. Annu Rev Neurosci. 2001;24:519-50.&lt;/ref&gt; A specialist [[prion disease]] clinic was established by Professor John Collinge at [[St Mary's Hospital, London]], in 1997.&lt;ref name="nationalprionclinic.org"&gt;http://www.nationalprionclinic.org&lt;/ref&gt; This was designated the NHS National Prion Clinic (NPC) in March 2001 by the [[UK Department of Health]].&lt;ref name=one&gt;NHS to open CJD clinic. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1398210.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=two&gt;CJD patients to receive specialist treatment at first dedicated clinic. https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/cjd-patients-to-receive-specialist-treatment-at-first-dedicated-clinic-674871.html&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2004, following the relocation of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) Prion Unit from [[Imperial College]] to [[University College London]] (UCL),&lt;ref name="prion.ucl.ac.uk"&gt;http://www.prion.ucl.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; the NPC relocated to the [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]] at [[Queen Square, London|Queen Square]],&lt;ref name="uclh.nhs.uk"&gt;http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/NR/rdonlyres/213992ED-FC59-4E21-B8D8-A3B3B97FFE5A/0/NHNNbrochurefinal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; The NPC is closely integrated with the MRC Prion Unit, a relationship of fundamental importance to the missions of both organisations.&lt;ref name="prion.ucl.ac.uk"/&gt; The NPC receives UK-wide and international referrals of all forms of suspected CJD or other prion diseases.&lt;ref name="uclh.nhs.uk"/&gt; It is internationally unique and has developed considerable experience in the clinical management of prion disease.&lt;ref name="uclh.nhs.uk"/&gt;

In addition to providing a national [[National Health Service|NHS]] centre of expertise for the management of all forms of CJD and other prion diseases, the clinic was established to facilitate research in both [[diagnostics]] and [[therapeutics]] including the organisation of [[clinical trial]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Collinge J, Gorham M, Hudson F, Kennedy A, Keogh G, Pal S, Rossor M, Rudge P, Siddique D, Spyer M, Thomas D, Walker S, Webb T, Wroe S, and Darbyshire J. A partially randomised patient preference trial to assess the safety and activity of quinacrine in human prion disease: the PRION-1 trial. Lancet Neurology. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Health Services Director at the [[NHS Executive]] wrote to all UK hospitals to inform them of the clinic, and encourage referral to it.&lt;ref&gt;Chief Executive's Bulletin (2001). http://www.publications.doh.gov.uk/cebulletin22march.htm 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The clinic liaises closely with the National CJD Surveillance Unit in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] (NCJDSU) to ensure that both centres are aware of all UK prion disease patients.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Lettersandcirculars/Dearcolleagueletters/DH_4085464&lt;/ref&gt;

==Referrals and staff==
Aside from patients with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and other prion diseases, referrals are welcome of healthy but at-risk individuals from families with inherited prion disease.&lt;ref name="nationalprionclinic.org"/&gt; With some of these large pedigrees a clinical relationship has been fostered for around two decades since [[mutation]]s in the [[prion protein]] gene and their use in diagnosis and [[genetic counseling]] were first reported from 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Collinge J, Harding AE, Owen F, Poulter M, Lofthouse R, Boughey AM, Shah T, Crow TJ. Diagnosis of Gerstmann–Straussler syndrome in familial dementia with prion protein gene analysis. Lancet 1989; 2: 15-7&lt;/ref&gt; Through collaboration with the [[UK Health Protection Agency]] referrals are received from individuals at risk of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease through [[blood transfusion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_073486&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the clinic staff comprised consultant [[neurologist]]s Professor John Collinge and Drs Simon Mead and Peter Rudge and consultant [[Neuroradiology|neuro-radiologist]] Harpreet Hyare. Permanent NHS staff include Michele Gorham, a consultant nurse; and a clinical counsellor; with part-time input from a senior [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologist]].&lt;ref name="nationalprionclinic.org"/&gt;

==The objectives of the NPC==
* To provide inpatient and outpatient services for the comprehensive assessment of all suspected CJD and other prion disease (sporadic, acquired and inherited). The service includes rapid clinical assessment and diagnosis including, [[neuroimaging]], [[neuropsychology]], [[neurophysiology]], [[molecular genetics]], cerebral and tonsil [[biopsy]] (including [[biochemical analysis]] of prion strain type), CSF markers and the co-ordination of subsequent management of patients and their families, in liaison with local [[healthcare]] professionals.
* Information, advice, support and [[counselling]] for patients and their families, both during investigation, on diagnosis, and long term follow up, working closely with and provide information and support for professionals working with registered patients in their local area.
* Advice and support from a [[clinical nurse specialist]], counsellor and consultant staff for patients, families, carers and health professionals including a telephone help-line and email advice. Close liaison with the principal UK patient [[support group]]s is critical: particularly the CJD Support Network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cjdsupport.net&lt;/ref&gt;
* Provide an internationally recognized centre of expertise for prion disease diagnosis and staff training. Also helping to develop national standards for patient management and [[infection control]] in hospitals, and provide clinical and scientific input to the activities of several government appointed national committees.
* To provide the infrastructure to enable UK clinical trials in prion disease and to facilitate the clinical and other research of the MRC Prion Unit and its collaborators. In 2007 the NPC completed the first large national clinical trial in prion disease, the PRION-1 trial of the experimental prion therapeutic [[quinacrine]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Currently (2010) the NPC is recruiting into the National Prion Monitoring Cohort study which aims to help optimise future clinical trials.&lt;ref name="nationalprionclinic.org"/&gt;

'''Osteopathic medicine in Canada''' is similar to [[conventional medicine]] in Canada, with the addition of [[osteopathic manipulation]] to diagnose and treat patients. Osteopathic physicians hold equal practice rights to non-osteopathic physicians (MDs) in Canada. North American [[osteopathic medicine]] requires an osteopathic physician to be trained and receive the [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree granted by a College of Osteopathic Medicine accredited by the American Osteopathic Association.

The [[Canadian Osteopathic Association]] (COA) represents osteopathic physicians registered for medical practice across Canada, and the [[Canadian osteopathic medical student association|Canadian Osteopathic Medical Student Association]] (COMSA) is the affiliated student organization.{{cn|date=July 2016}} In Canada, the titles "osteopath" and "osteopathic physician" are protected in some provinces by the medical regulatory college for physicians and surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_91m30_e.htm |title=Ontario Medicine Act – Restricted Titles, Section 9 |publisher=Province of Ontario, Canada |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/19_416_2008 |title='&amp;#39;British Columbia Medical Practitioners Act,'&amp;#39; Section 40 Registration of Osteopaths |date=1 June 2009 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/m-11/20060310/whole.html |title='&amp;#39;Alberta Medical Profession Act,'&amp;#39; Sections 3 and 18 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, there were approximately 20 U.S.-trained osteopathic physicians, all of which held a [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree, practicing in all of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedo.osteopathic.org/?p=80661 |title=MSUCOM pilot program targets Canadian students for training |publisher=The DO |accessdate=3 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424064948/http://thedo.osteopathic.org/?p=80661 |archive-date=2014-04-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, no training programs have been established for osteopathic physicians in Canada.&lt;ref name="Who Provides Osteopathy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osteopathyontario.org/about-osteopathy/who-provides-osteopathy/|title=Who Provides Osteopathy?|publisher=Ontario Association of Osteopathic Manual Practitioners|accessdate=28 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424130524/http://osteopathyontario.org/about-osteopathy/who-provides-osteopathy/|archive-date=2014-04-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are no DO programs outside the United States.

A '''plague pit''' is the informal term used to refer to [[mass grave]]s in which victims of the [[Black Death]] were buried. The term is most often used to describe pits located in [[Great Britain]], but can be applied to any place where [[bubonic plague]] victims were buried.

==Origin==
The plague  which swept across [[China]], [[Middle East]], and [[Europe]] in the 14th century is estimated to have killed between one-third and two-thirds of [[Medieval demography|Europe's population]].&lt;ref name="barry"&gt;Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, "The Greatest Epidemic of History" ("La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire", in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n° 310, June 2006, pp.45-46, say "between one-third and two-thirds"; [[Robert Gottfried]] (1983). "Black Death" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', volume 2, pp.257-67, says "between 25 and 45 percent".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.boisestate.edu/westciv/plague/15.shtml |title=Population Loss |publisher=History.boisestate.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207081157/http://history.boisestate.edu/westciv/plague/15.shtml |archivedate=2009-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/osheim/plaguein.html |title=Plague and Public Health in Renaissance Europe |publisher=.iath.virginia.edu |date=1994-10-28 |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disposal of the bodies of those who died presented huge problems for the authorities, and eventually the normal patterns of burial and funerary observance broke down.

==Major plague outbreaks==
Plague pits were used especially often during major plague outbreaks, such as the [[Great Plague of London|London epidemic of 1665]]. During these times, graveyards rapidly filled, and such graves became available only to wealthy people. Parishes became strained; one example, the records of [[St Bride's Church]] on [[Fleet Street]] during the London 1665 plague, shows typical methods employed by the parishes.

In 1665, the total number of deaths in the parish rose to five and a half times their normal number, with 2,111 deaths overall and 1,427 attributed to plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/cmh/epiharding.html |title=Burial of the plague dead in early modern London |publisher=History.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy regarding Black Death pathogen ==
Some scientists have put forward the idea that the Black Death was not caused by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' as some have thought, and some evidence of this has been found in plague pits, where the pathogens of other diseases, such as [[anthrax]], have been discovered.

However the screening of over 100 skeletal remains from Black Death victims buried in London's [[East Smithfield]] plague pit points to ''Yersinia pestis'' as the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/10/black_death.html|title=Black Death plague pit produces first ancient bacterial genome : News blog|website=blogs.nature.com|date=12 October 2011 |first=Ewen|last=Callaway|access-date=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleeding from hemorrhoids and vulvar lesions can be mistaken for postcoital bleeding.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Post coital bleeding can occur with discharge, itching, or irritation. This may be due to ''[[Trichomonas]]'' or ''[[Candidiasis|Candida]]''.&lt;ref name = mscape/&gt; A lack of estrogen can make vaginal tissue thinner and more susceptible to bleeding. Some have proposed that [[birth control pills]] may cause postcoital bleeding.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113478|title=Clinical practice guidelines for the assessment of young women aged 20-24 with abnormal vaginal bleeding|last=Health|first=Department of|date=2010-03-03|access-date=2018-02-04|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101110212848/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113478|archivedate=2010-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk factors for developing postcoital bleeding are: low estrogen levels, rape and 'rough sex'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Diagnosis and treatment ==
Tests and detailed examination are used to determine the cause of the bleeding:
* a [[pregnancy test]]
* a [[pelvic examination]]&lt;ref name="nhs" /&gt; 
* obtaining tissue samples
* pap smear
* [[Colposcopy|colposcopic]] examination of the vagina and cervix
* [[ultrasound]]
* histogram
* cultures for bacteria&lt;ref name="mscape" /&gt;
* biopsy of tissues&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A [[Referral (medicine)|referral]] may be made to a specialist.&lt;ref name="nhs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/guidelines-research-services/guidelines/postcoital-bleeding-query-bank/|title=Postcoital bleeding|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal College of Obstetricians &amp;amp; Gynaecologists|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging may not be necessary. Cryotherapy has been used but is not recommended.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Postcoital bleeding rarely is associated with gynecological cancer in young women and its incidence is projected to drop due to the widespread [[Immunization|immunizations]] against [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV]]. Postcoital bleeding has been most studied in women in the US.  In a large Taiwanese study, the overall incidence of postcoital bleeding was found to be 39-59  per 100,000 women. Those with postcoital bleeding had a higher risk of [[Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia|cervical dysplasia]] and [[Cervical cancer|cervical cancer.]] [[Benignity|Benign]] causes of postcoital bleeding were associated with [[Cervical ectropion|cervical erosion]], ectropion, [[vaginitis]] and vulvovaginitis. Other associations were noted such as the presence of [[leukoplakia]] of the cervix, an [[Intrauterine device|intrauterine contraceptive device]], [[Cervical polyp|cervical polyps]], [[cervicitis]], [[menopause]], [[dyspareunia]], and [[vulvodynia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Hsin-Li|last2=Chen|first2=Chuan-Mei|last3=Pai|first3=Lee-Wen|last4=Hwu|first4=Yueh-Juen|last5=Lee|first5=Horng-Mo|last6=Chung|first6=Yueh-Chin|date=2017-04-01|title=Comorbidity profiles among women with postcoital bleeding: a nationwide health insurance database|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00404-017-4327-7|journal=Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics|language=en|volume=295|issue=4|pages=935–941|doi=10.1007/s00404-017-4327-7|issn=0932-0067}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Scotland approximately 1 in 600 women aged 20-24 experience unexplained bleeding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study of African women found an that trauma from consensual sexual intercourse was a cause of postcoital bleeding in young women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== In society and culture ==
In Islamic culture, postcoital bleeding may be desired to "satisfy cultural and/or religious 'needs'".  It is controversial: 
{{Quote box|width=60em|align=left| quote = "From a Western-ethics perspective, the life-saving potential of the procedure is weighed against the role of the surgeon in directly assisting in a deception and in indirectly promoting cultural practices of sexual inequality. From an Islamic bioethical vantage point, jurists offer two opinions. The first is that the surgery is always impermissible. The second is that although the surgery is generally impermissible, it can become licit when the risks of not having postcoital bleeding harm are sufficiently great."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bawany|first=Mohammad H.|last2=Padela|first2=Aasim I.|title=Hymenoplasty and Muslim Patients: Islamic Ethico-Legal Perspectives|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1743609517312924|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=14|issue=8|pages=1003–1010|doi=10.1016/j.jsxm.2017.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3027">The '''Public Health Research Institute''' ('''PHRI''') was established in 1942 as an independent not-for-profit research organization affiliated with the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|New York City Department of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;Heyman, D. M. (1942). Annual Report of the Public Health Research Institute of the City of New York, Inc. July 1, 1941 - June 30, 1942. http://www.phri.org/overview/over_history02.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Ralph Muckenfuss]], director of the Bureau of Laboratories of the Department of Health, was designated as the first director of the Institute. The mission of the Institute was to conduct research in areas related to the public health problems of New York City. The Institute had three divisions—Infectious Disease, Applied Immunology, and Nutrition and Physiology (which later became the Division of Biochemistry). The institute was originally housed in simple quarters at 16th Street and the East River. As it grew in size the Institute eventually moved to a new building at 26th Street and First Avenue, across the street from the original Carnegie Laboratory of [[New York University]]. The Institute maintained close connections with NYU with most of the staff holding faculty appointments at the university.

PHRI was unique in being the only basic medical research organization in the nation that received substantial municipal support. Originally the City contributed $100,000 per year. Over time this increased to $350,000 per year with New York State contributing the same amount. This arrangement continued until the financial crisis of 1977 forced both the city and the state to end their funding for the institute. The Institute survived this loss of funding and continued to operate with funding from the National Institutes of Health and other research funders.

In 2002, PHRI became associated with the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]] and moved to the International Center for Public Health in Newark, New Jersey, a building which it shares with the UMDNJ Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics and the National Tuberculosis Center. PHRI operated independently until 2006 when it merged with UMDNJ and was established as a research center of the University and New Jersey Medical School. PHRI researchers now hold faculty positions in the departments of medicine, 
microbiology, biochemistry and molecular genetics of New Jersey Medical School.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phri.org/overview/over_history01.asp&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, UMDNJ and Rutgers merged to form Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences.

'''Sanjoy Ghose''' ({{lang-bn| সঞ্জয় ঘোষ}}) (7 December 1959 – 4 July 1997) was an [[India]]n rural development activist known for his pioneering contributions to community health and development media. He is believed to have been killed by [[United Liberation Front of Asom]] (ULFA) militants in the river island of [[Majuli]] on the [[Brahmaputra]] river around 4 July 1997.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in [[Nagpur]], Ghose spent his formative years and his adolescence in [[Mumbai]], Maharashtra. He belonged to a well known Bengali family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Sanjay Ghose killing a mistake: Ulfa – Rift in outfit ahead of Feb. 10 peace talks | quote =Ghose, who was brought up in Mumbai and later settled in Delhi, was related to several among the Bengali who’s who. Former Doordarshan chief Bhaskar Ghose was an uncle, while former Supreme Court judge Ruma Pal and diplomat Arundhati Ghose were his aunts. | newspaper =The Telegraph, Calcutta,India | date =6 February 2011 | url =http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110206/jsp/frontpage/story_13543113.jsp }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bhaskar Ghose, erstwhile Director General of [[Doordarshan]], the Indian public television network, is his uncle.

After school, he was educated at a liberal arts college, [[Elphinstone College]] located in [[Mumbai]]. Apart from graduating in rural development and law with college and university honours, he also edited the college magazine, ran the English literature club, and won [[University of Mumbai]] competitions for quizzing and debating. He was also active in the [[National Service Scheme]] – taking his fellow students to remote tribal villages in the hilly tracts abutting the [[Western Ghats]] in [[Thane district]]- to experience first hand the poverty and exploitation of the tribal communities.

In 1980, he chose to join the then unknown [[Institute of Rural Management, Anand]] (IRMA) in its very first batch. He had confirmed admissions to all the three then existing IIMs, ( [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad|Indian Institute of Management]] )  – Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta. Joining the prestigious IIM opened the way to very well paying corporate careers.

Dr.Srikanth Sambrani, the first director of IRMA, remembered the selection interview, in an Indian Express article, dated 12 August 1997, thus –
"I first met him in 1980, when conducting admissions interviews for the Institute of Rural Management at Anand. We were highly impressed by his paper qualifications. He walked into our small room, all 5 ft 5 in of him held like the fearless bantam he undoubtedly was. But since he had applied to IIM Ahmedabad also, we thought we would lose him. We spent an hour discussing the relative merits of IIMA and IRMA. When he turned down IIMA, it was a coup for us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/19970812/22450383.html |title=Sanjoy Ghose: Joy and outrage |publisher=Expressindia.com |date=12 August 1997 |accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
After his post graduation with very good grades from IRMA, in 1982, he chose to work in a small rural development trust, [[Tribhuvandas Foundation]], in Anand, Kheda district, over much more visible and better paying jobs with Government sponsored milk cooperative federations. In Tribhuvandas Foundation, he catalysed its growth from a small family run trust, to working in hundred odd villages, hiring professional rural medical doctors, and extension staff.

After two years with Tribhuvandas foundation, he won the INLAKs foundation scholarship for a MSc degree in economics from [[St Anne's College, Oxford]] in 1984.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Gazette"&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |authorlink=  |title=OBITUARIES- St.Anne's college |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/1997-8/weekly/150198/coll.htm#5Ref |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020223042025/http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/1997-8/weekly/150198/coll.htm#5Ref|work= |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |doi= |date=15 January 1998 |month= |year= |archivedate=2002-02-23|accessdate=7 December 2012 |dead-url=yes|quote=SANJOY GHOSE; MSc student 1984–5. Aged 39. }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Oxford, he decided to return to rural India. He set up the URMUL Rural Health and Development Trust&amp;nbsp;— in the desert district of Bikaner in Rajasthan.(1986). While working with URMUL, he won the Hubert Humphrey fellowship&amp;nbsp;— and spent a year with the prestigious [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] in the year 1988–89. Working with the sick of the poorest of the poor, told on his personal health. He contracted tuberculosis, while collecting sputum for testing, from potential TB patients. After establishing URMUL Rural Health and Development Trust as a mainstream NGO in Rajasthan, he handed over the organisation to a successor, and shifted to Delhi. This was an unprecedented decision for Indian voluntary agencies&amp;nbsp;— as the founders usually hang on to their leadership position till they die.

Sanjoy Ghose wrote extensively about his grassroot experiences with the URMUL Trust in Lunkaransar Village in Bikaner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ghose |first1=Sanjoy |year=1995 |title=Settlement in the Indira Gandhi canal command: a new perspective |journal=Land Reforms in India |volume= |issue= |pages=176–182 |publisher=Sage Publications |url=http://www.cwds.ac.in/library/services/26.Land_Rights.pdf |accessdate=7 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053012/http://www.cwds.ac.in/library/services/26.Land_Rights.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Indian Express, a leading national daily, used his writings to launched a successful monthly column named 'Village Voice'. The "action experiment"  of tapping the power of the mainstream middle class urban English media to reflect unheard rural voices spoken in local languages, grounded in very local realities, got a measure of success.

Recognizing the potential of writing in mainstream media to highlight rural development issues and catalyse change, Sanjoy conceived of CHARKHA. CHARKHA appears to have been initiated to exploit the legitimate opportunities available in the national media for influencing policies related to rural development. It also addressed the concern that such a massive task, required more support than his single voice. His discussions with senior media persons from the national dailies seemed to suggest that an organisation dedicated to development communication could work. CHARKHA in a sense was an attempt to  "institutionalize"  the success of the "Village voice" experience&amp;nbsp;— and broaden the scope to bring in more writing talent and different geographies. On 24 October 1994, CHARKHA was formally initiated in New Delhi- with the goal of spinning action into words.Its formal vision is "To contribute towards building a harmonious, inclusive society empowered by knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charkha.org/html/genesis.html |title=Genesis |publisher=Charkha.org |date=24 October 1994 |accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanjoy appeared to have been a firm believer in the philosophy of [[Reflective practice]]. He wrote and published extensively, analytic pieces on rural development- which would have incorporated insights from his own personal experiences as a catalyst for rural change
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ghose |first=Sanjoy |authorlink= |title=Voices from the Field: A Symposium on People's Experiences with the Development Process |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lijPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Sanjoy+Ghose&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_9bXUcnNAsGkrQehooHABg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBw |accessdate=6 July 2013 |year=1995 |publisher=Singh |location= |isbn= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]] had also published one such paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nagle | first1=William| last2= Ghose|first2=Sanjoy |title=Community Participation in World Bank Supported Projects Issue 8 of Strategic planning and review discussion paper |publisher=World Bank Strategic Planning and Review Department, Policy Research and External Affairs,  |year=1990 |pages=28 |url =http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34607585?selectedversion=NBD8810892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After launching CHARKHA, he decided to work in the insurgent prone Upper Assam, specifically in Majuli island on the Brahmaputra. His father recollected the family discussions around this decision.  " When we were dissuading Sanjoy from going to the terrorism-ridden [[Assam]]", he replied, "then whose son will you send ?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Sangeeta Singh |title= Shankar Ghose He is passionate about connecting the poor with mainstream media | quote =He speaks passionately about Charkha’s activities, and about his son, even as his tea gets cold.

[[File:Sanjoy Ghose with his team of social workers in Majuli island.jpg|thumb|right|Sanjoy Ghose with his team of social workers in Majuli island.]]
Through the sponsorship of Association of Voluntary Agencies for Rurul Development, North East (AVARD-NE) Sanjoy and seven colleagues set up base in Majuli island on the [[Brahmaputra]] river in April 1996. The island faced annual flooding and erosion of land. The island had shrunk by around 500 square kilometres in the last twenty years. Around February 1997, he and his team mobilised around 30,000 human days of voluntary labour (shram dhan). An experimental stretch of 1.7 kilometres of land was protected from erosion, by building embankments: using only local resources and their knowledge. The following year this protected stretch of the island survived the floods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Chetna Verma | title =Majuli remembers Sanjoy Ghose a decade and half later | quote =The turning point came in February 1997, when more than 30,000-man-days of labour were volunteered by the community, and an experimental stretch of 1.7 kilometers was protected from erosion using local wisdom and resources. The following year, this protected stretch of the island survived the floods, raising hopes and sending ripples of triumph through the people. | newspaper =ANI News | date =4 July 2012 | url =http://www.aninews.in/newsdetail2/story60761/Majuli-remembers-Sanjoy-Ghose-a-decade-and-half-later.html | access-date =7 December 2012 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120707010651/http://www.aninews.in/newsdetail2/story60761/majuli-remembers-sanjoy-ghose-a-decade-and-half-later.html | archive-date =7 July 2012 | dead-url =yes | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sanjoy, in this short time, had also diversified the social activities in Majuli: around health (malaria prevention),livelihoods (design, and manufacturing of bamboo and woven products), and education (village libraries).

It appears that by doing so, Sanjoy and his group had displeased a powerful local Government works contractor lobby: which also provided patronage to the [[United Liberation Front of Assam]] (ULFA). When posters were put up by presumably this contractor lobby, which would have lost its annual lucrative contracts for "flood protection":   many locals participated in a public meeting on 1 June 1997, to express solidarity with the constructive work done. The local police offered Sanjoy protection, in view of the public threats issued by ULFA. Sanjoy however refused this, in tune with his personal beliefs that "local people are my best protection". ULFA abducted Sanjoy on 4 July 1997.

This was on June 1, 1997. The group had already engaged in flood relief and malaria prevention, design and production of weaving and bamboo crafts; it had also set up village libraries. The police offered him protection but Sanjoy refused, saying people were his protection. Soon after, he was abducted.

==Legacy==

An international appeal for his release carried by the leftist magazine [[Economic and Political Weekly]], summarised his work in Rajasthan and in media advocacy thus;
"From 1986 to 1995 Sanjoy did pioneering work in western Rajasthan. He set up URMUL Trust in 1986 in Bikaner with the chief objective of empowering the local people to address their own development needs. By 1995, URMUL expanded into a network of organisations addressing the concerns of the poor in the districts of Bikaner, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer in western Rajasthan. Sanjoy wrote extensively and spiritedly on development issues. He was one of the firsts to realise the need for media advocacy for the NGOs and struggle-based groups, and established CHARKHA as an interface between NGOs and the mainstream media."
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=letters |first1= |year=1997 |title= Appeal For Release of Sanjoy Ghose

A couple of decades, after his untimely demise, both his creations, URMUL Trust and CHARKHA continue to survive and grow in the "rural development sector"   – URMUL and its affiliates in the desert districts of Rajasthan, and CHARKHA in the world of development media.
CHARKHA has instituted the "Sanjoy Ghose Media Fellowships" in his memory. This has been awarded since 2003 in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, to encourage writers, particularly women, to generate research based writings that reflect their unique perspective on the concerns of their people in a region that has known conflicts for several decades now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charkha.org/html/fellows01.html |title=Media Fellowships |publisher=Charkha.org |date= |accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the award was targeted to women writers from the underdeveloped mountain region of [[Ladakh]]. In 2015, the award had been renamed Sanjoy Ghose Rural Reporting Awards (Ladakh) 2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =ANI | title = Sanjoy Ghose Rural Reporting Awards (Ladakh) 2015 announced

A total of four awards of Rs 20,000 each will be given to well-researched and sharply-focused unpublished writings that are expected to highlight little-known strengths and travails of the women of this remote but significant part of India with a view to bringing them into the mainstream development fold. The Awards, inspired by Charkha's founder, Sanjoy Ghose who worked towards the social and economic inclusion of rural marginalised communities through the creative use of media, offer an opportunity for writers to delve into the challenges faced by the women of rural disadvantaged communities and reflect the status of development as perceived by these women. | newspaper =Business Standard | date = September 8, 2015| url =http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/sanjoy-ghose-rural-reporting-awards-ladakh-2015-announced-115090800629_1.html |access-date= 2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of Charkha in 2017, stated that "Charkha has since upheld this vision articulated in its mandate "To contribute towards building a harmonious, inclusive society empowered by knowledge".Over the last more than two decades Charkha has translated this into an expansive engagement with rural marginalised communities across several regions in the country.Through its #Tri-lingual Feature Service in Hindi, English and Urdu the organisation continues to place their perspectives as articles in the media across the three languages. Charkha is making all attempts to live up to a phrase coined at the time of its founding " Spinning Action into Words"!"

In 2016 and 2017, students of the [[Institute of Rural Management Anand]], have celebrated his birthday, (7 December)  as "Joy Day': by organising a blood donation drive, and hosting a function to remember him in their campus.

In 37 years Sanjoy Ghose had packed more into life than most people do in a hundred years or more. An article in the prominent political magazine [[Tehelka]], described Sanjoy as "The man who saw tomorrow". It ran a feature on him with the title "Sanjoy Ghose was a dogged catalyst of change. And he paid the ultimate price for it".
RN Haldipur, (former director of IRMA),who served on the Board of Tribhuvandas Foundation, when Sanjoy was working there, assessed him thus "Sanjoy was a positive and tenacious votary who functioned with single-minded purpose. Instead of joining the corporate sector, he took the hard path, full of difficulties and austerity. To him work was soul-satisfying worship. Transparent in his dealings, he was a man of great integrity."

'''Solita Solano''' (1888 – 22 November 1975), born '''Sarah Wilkinson''', was an American writer, poet and journalist.

==Biography==
[[File:Solita Solano und Djuna Barnes in Paris.jpg|thumb|right|Solita Solano and Djuna Barnes in Paris (Maurice Brange, ''Au Café'', 1922).]]

=== Early life ===
Sarah Wilkinson came from a middle-class family and attended the [[Emma Willard School]] in [[Troy, New York]]. After the death of her father, she left home and married her childhood sweetheart Oliver Filley. They spent the next four years in the [[Philippines]], in [[China]] and in [[Japan]], where her husband worked as an engineer. They returned to New York in 1908, where she started work as a theatre critic and drama editor with the [[New York Tribune]] and as a freelance contributor to the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Becoming Americans in Paris: Transatlantic Politics and Culture between the World Wars|last=Blower|first=Brooke L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199792771|location=|pages=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time she changed her name to ''Solita Solano''.

===Career and relationships===

In 1919, Solano got to know the journalist [[Janet Flanner]] in  [[Greenwich Village]] with whom she started a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wartime Sites in Paris: 1939-1945|last=Lehrer|first=Steven|publisher=SF Tafel Publishers|year=2013|isbn=1492292923|location=|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 they travelled to [[Greece]], where Janet was to work on a report for [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] on [[Constantinople]]. Solano had three books published, and as they were not very successful, returned to journalism. In 1922, they travelled to  [[France]], and in [[Paris]] they joined the intellectuel-lesbian circle of [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Alice B. Toklas]], [[Natalie Clifford Barney]], [[Romaine Brooks]] and [[Djuna Barnes]].

In 1929, Solano had an affair with [[Margaret Caroline Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], founder of [[The Little Review]], who had come to Paris with her lover, French singer [[Georgette Leblanc]]. The affair lasted several years, though Anderson remained living with Leblanc.&lt;ref name=liz&gt;[http://drs.library.yale.edu:8083/saxon/SaxonServlet?style=http://drs.library.yale.edu:8083/saxon/EAD/yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;source=http://drs.library.yale.edu:8083/fedora/get/beinecke:andersonm/EAD Elizabeth Jenks Clark Collection of Margaret Anderson]&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Paris, Janet Flanner started writing, under the [[Pseudonym]] ''Genêt'', the ''Letter from Paris'', for ''[[The New Yorker]]''.  After the outbreak of World War II Solano and Flanner returned to New York.&lt;ref name=liz/&gt;

A few years later Solano left Flanner after Flanner started an affair with [[Natalia Danesi Murray]]; meanwhile Solano fell in love with [[Elizabeth Jenks Clark]]. Margaret Anderson got to know Clark through Solano after Clark returned to the US. Clark and Solano became Anderson's closest friends, although Anderson had in the meantime fallen in love with Dorothy Caruso, widow of the singer [[Enrico Caruso]].

=== As Gurdjieff's follower ===
During the 1930s and 40s, Solano studied with [[G. I. Gurdjieff]], and for a while acted as his secretary. She was a member of a key Gurdjieff group known as "The Rope," to which [[Jane Heap]], [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], and [[Kathryn Hulme]] also belonged. After Gurdjieff's death in 1949, Solano became the focal point for members of The Rope until her own death. Her notes of Gurdjieff's meetings with The Rope are a remarkable record of his personality and method.&lt;ref name=paul&gt;Baker, Rob. "No Harem. Gurdjieff and the Women of The Rope." Gurdjieff International Review (http://www.gurdjieff.org/rope.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life and death===

After the war Solano returned to France, where she died at the age of 87.&lt;ref name=liz/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10172">{{short description|The sixth of 17 Sustainable Development Goals calling for clean water and sanitation for all people by 2030}}
'''Sustainable Development Goal 6''' ('''SDG6''' or '''SDG 6'''), one of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] established by the UN in 2015. It calls for clean water and [[sanitation]] for all people. The official wording is: "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."&lt;ref name="SDG6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation.html|title=Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal has eight targets to be achieved by at least 2030. Progress toward the targets will be measured by using eleven "indicators."     

SDG6 is closely linked with other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  For example, improving sanitation also helps make cities more sustainable (Goal 11). Sanitation improvements can lead to more jobs (Goal 8) which would also lead to economic growth (Goal 8).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  SDG6 progress improves [[health]] (Goal 3) and [[social justice]] (Goal 16).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf|title=Press release – UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group proposes sustainable development goals|date=19 July 2014|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targets==

SDG 6 has eight targets. Six of them are to be achieved by the year 2030, one by the year 2020 and one has no target year.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/targets/|title=Goal 6 Targets|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Development Programme|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the targets also has one or two indicators which will be used to measure progress. In total there are 11 indicators for SDG6.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6|title=SDGs|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first three targets relate to drinking [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]:&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt; 

# By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]] for all
# By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] for all and end [[open defecation]], paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations
# By 2030, improve water quality by reducing [[Water pollution|pollution]], eliminating dumping and minimizing release of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous chemicals]] and materials, halving the proportion of untreated [[wastewater]] and substantially increasing [[Reclaimed water|recycling and safe reuse]] globally

Safe drinking water and hygienic [[toilets]] protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption supports education and employment, both of which are the foundation of alleviating poverty. Therefore, toilets at school and at the work place are included in the second target ("achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all"). Equitable sanitation and hygiene solutions address the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities.

Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented. Preserving natural sources of water is very important so as to achieve universal access to safe and affordable [[drinking water]]. Therefore, one target aims to reduce [[water pollution]] by eliminating dumping and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and untreated [[wastewater]]. The potential for recycling and safe [[Reclaimed water|reuse of wastewater]] is also mentioned.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets" /&gt;

==Indicators==
[[File:Pit latrines in Zambia (3233256285).jpg|thumb|Unimproved sanitation example: [[pit latrine]] without slab in [[Lusaka]], Zambia]]
The main indicator for the sanitation target is the "Proportion of population using [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]] services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The current statistic in the 2017 baseline estimate by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) is that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The JMP is a joint program of [[UNICEF]] and [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and compiles data to monitor SDG6 progress. 

The definition of safely managed sanitation service is: "Use of improved facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite."&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}} Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact.&lt;ref name="JMP2017" /&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Links with other SDGs==
The SDGs are all interlinked.

Sanitation systems with a [[Reuse of excreta|resource recovery]] and reuse focus are getting increased attention and can contribute to achieving at least fourteen of the SDGs, especially in an urban context.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.trust.org/item/20170919145350-bovq7|title=The rise of the sanitation economy: how business can help solve a global crisis|last=Paranipe|first=Nitin|date=14 November 2017|website=Thomson Reuters Foundation News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andersson|first=Kim|last2=Dickin|first2=Sarah|last3=Rosemarin|first3=Arno|date=2016-12-08|title=Towards "Sustainable" Sanitation: Challenges and Opportunities in Urban Areas|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/12/1289|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1289|doi=10.3390/su8121289}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recovering the resources embedded in excreta and wastewater (like nutrients, water and energy) contributes to achieving Goal 12 ([[sustainable consumption]] and [[sustainable production|production]]) and Goal 2 (end hunger). 

Ensuring adequate sanitation and wastewater management along the entire value chain in cities contributes to Goal 11 ([[sustainable cities]] and communities), Goal 1 (no poverty) and Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Organizations==

The [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) works on sanitation issues as a global network of 9000 individuals and 300 partner organizations. Global organizations such as [[Oxfam]], [[UNICEF]], [[WaterAid]] and many small NGOs as well as universities, research centres, private enterprises, government-owned entities etc. are all part of SuSanA and are dedicated to achieving SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|title=Contribution of sustainable sanitation to the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development - SuSanA Vision Document 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=SuSanA, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ending [[open defecation]] will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] of the population. This will require cooperation between governments, civil society and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982187046|title=Beyond the bottom line: integrating sustainability into business and management practice|last=Kellogg|first=Diane M.|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|others=Gudić, Milenko,, Tan, Tay Keong,, Flynn, Patricia M.,|year=2017|isbn=9781783533275|location=Saltaire, UK|pages=|chapter=The Global Sanitation Crisis: A Role for Business|oclc=982187046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tata Swach''' is a [[Water purification|water purifier]] developed by [[Tata Chemicals]], a part of the [[Tata group]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tatachemicals.com/products/tata_swach.htm Tata Swach]&lt;/ref&gt; Swach was designed as a low cost purifier for Indian low-income groups, who lack access to safe drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/biz/india-business/-Tatas-Swach-water-plan-/articleshow/5308835.cms Tata’s ‘Swach’ water plan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Tatas-Swach-may-be-worlds-cheapest-water-purifier/articleshow/5312187.cms Tatas do a Nano in water purifier at Rs 1k]&lt;/ref&gt; The product is sold in three variants as '''Tata Swach''', '''Tata Swach Smart''' and '''Tata Swach Smart Magic'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tataswach.com/Newintroductions.aspx Tata Swach New Introductions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110071211/http://www.tataswach.com/Newintroductions.aspx |date=2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product development==
Tata Swach was designed by Tata Research, Development and Design Centre (TRDDC) and Tata Chemicals with contributions from other Tata group companies. In 2004 the company developed a water purifier called '''Sujal'''. [[Tata Consultancy Services]] deployed thousands of these filters in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami disaster of 2004]] as part of its relief activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs_iportals/iportals/aboutus/annualreport/2005/IEEE-AR05-Section1.pdf Improving our world - IEEE Annual Report (Page 4)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sujal was a very basic low-cost model which used rice-husk ash (produced from heating rice husk in combination with pebbles and cement). Activated [[silica]] and carbon is present in the ash; silica can reduce the turbidity of water, while activated carbon binds with and adsorbs non-polar impurities (such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertiliser]]s). However, the purification system did not have [[Bacteriostatic agent|bacteriostatic]] or [[Bactericide|bactericidal]] properties and it was incapable of removing impurities such as lithium, alcohols, ammonia, strong acids and bases or inorganic substances like sodium, lead, iron, arsenic and nitrates.&lt;ref name=cse&gt;[http://www.cseindia.org/node/852 Tata uses nano technology for water purifier]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Muraly Sastry, Chief Scientific Officer of Tata Chemicals, confirmed that even though Sujal could successfully remove the odour, colour and particulate matter from impure water, many pathogens could not be eliminated.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

To address these concerns the Swach product was conceptualised by Tata Consultancy Services and produced by Tata Chemicals. [[Titan Industries]] contributed to the development of special assembly presses for mass production of the units.

===[[Nanotechnology|Nanotech]] purification technology===
In the Tata Swach design, water purification is carried out using processed rice husk ash impregnated with nano (1 x 10{{su|p=''-9''}}) silver particles for purifying the water and to destroy disease causing bacteria, germs and other organisms. The bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of silver are attributed to its ability to react with the sulphhydryl (-SH) groups in the bacterial cells that produces the structural changes in bacterial cell membranes and interacts with nucleic acids. The nano sized particles help in increasing the surface area so that the bacteria get enough reaction time.&lt;ref&gt;India Environment Portal report [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720130556/http://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/tata-purifier.doc Tata uses nano technology for water purifier]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swach can purify water at the rate of about {{convert|3|to|4|L|USgal impgal}} every hour.&lt;ref name=cse /&gt; The purifier consists of two parts; an upper reservoir where the untreated water enters and a lower middle portion with a bulb to which the cartridge can be attached. Another reservoir is placed at the lower end, which collects purified water. The two chambers are stackable and arranged so that the entire system can function on gravity. The Tata Swach Smart is a variant with a more compact design, holding {{convert|15|L|USgal impgal}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tata Chemicals Press Release|url=http://www.tataswach.com/MediaPress.aspx?id=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tata Swach Bulb===
Tata Swach Bulb is the main purifying unit of the product. The Swach Bulb, depending on the quality of water, can purify about {{convert|3000|L|USgal impgal}} of water, after which the bulb must be replaced. The bulb has a "fuse" indicating when a cartridge change is required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tataswach.com/technology/tata_swach_bulb.html Tata Swach Bulb - Modern chemistry of Silver nanotechnology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014122353/http://www.tataswach.com/technology/tata_swach_bulb.html |date=2012-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''AfriPop''' Project, is a non-profit project primarily funded by the Fondation Philippe Wiener - Maurice Anspach, Belgium. AfriPop represents a collaboration between the [[University of Florida]], United States, the [[University of Brussels]], Belgium and the Malaria Public Health &amp; Epidemiology Group, Centre for Geographic Medicine, [[Kenya]].

[[File:AfriPop Project - Africa population density 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The AfriPop alpha version population distribution dataset.]]
High resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are a prerequisite for the accurate measurement of the impacts of population growth, for monitoring changes and for planning interventions. The '''AfriPop''' project was initiated in July 2009 with an aim of producing detailed and freely-available population distribution maps for the whole of sub-Saharan [[Africa]].

The '''AfriPop''' team have assembled a unique spatial database of linked information on contemporary census data across Africa, satellite-imagery derived settlement maps and land cover information. Novel approaches to extracting detailed spatial data on settlements from satellite imagery &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tatem AJ, Noor AM, Hay SI | title = Defining approaches to settlement mapping for public health management in Kenya using medium spatial resolution satellite imagery | journal = Remote Sensing of Environment | volume = 93 | pages = 42–52 | year = 2004 | doi=10.1016/j.rse.2004.06.014| pmc=3350067 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been combined with contemporary detailed census data and land cover to map population densities across sub-Saharan Africa at unprecedented levels of detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Linard C, Alegana, VA, Noor AM, Snow RW, Tatem AJ | title =  A high resolution spatial population database of Somalia for disease risk mapping | journal = International Journal of Health Geographics | volume = 9 | pages = 45 | year = 2010 | doi=10.1186/1476-072x-9-45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tatem AJ, Noor AM, von Hagen C, Di Gregorio A, Hay SI | title =  High resolution settlement and population maps for low income nations: combining land cover and national census in East Africa | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001298 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | pages = e1298 | year = 2007 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant maps are freely available from the project website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6071">'''Timothy's Law''' is the reference used for a [[New York (state)|New York]] state statute signed into law on December 22, 2006 by Governor [[George E. Pataki]] which took effect January 1, 2007. The law requires that [[health insurance|health plans]] sold in the state provide comparable coverage for mental health ailments as it does for physical aliments.  This is often referred to as mental health parity.&lt;ref name="text"&gt;[http://www.nyspsych.org/public/components/societytools/admin/viewNewnews.asp?newsjob=ArticleID&amp;ArticleID=7157&amp;ArticleName=Mental+Health+Parity+%2D+Timothy%27s+Law Text of Bill #S8482] provided by the ''New York State Psychiatric Association'' last accessed 2007-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The law was named after Timothy, a boy from [[Schenectady]], NY who committed suicide at age 12 on March 16, 2001. Timothy had been diagnosed with several behavioral disorders and severe depression but had exhausted the mental health benefits on his family's health plan.  As a result, the O'Clairs were forced to relinquish full custody of their child in order to make him eligible for Medicaid which paid for all the services which Timothy needed. However, when Timothy returned home, he once again was bound by the limits of his parents medical insurance benefits.&lt;ref name="timstory"&gt;{{cite web| title = Timothy's Story| publisher = timothyslaw.org| url = http://www.timothyslaw.org/timothys_story.htm| accessdate = 2007-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Timothy's parents joined other mental health advocates and lent Timothy's name to the parity movement in New York State and petitioned the state government to pass a law that would require health plans to provide coverage for mental health ailments and behavioral disorders comparable with coverage for physical ailments.

"Timothy's Law" was sponsored by Senators [[Thomas Morahan]] and [[Thomas Libous]] and passed the state senate on September 15, 2006.&lt;ref name="O'Clair"&gt;[http://www.nysenate.gov/press-release/senate-passes-timothy-s-law-provide-mental-health-parity Senate Passes "Timothy's Law" to Provide Mental Health Parity] New York State Senate Press Release (2006-09-15). Retrieved on 2009-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt;   It was Sponsored by Assembly Members [[Paul Tonko]] and [[Peter Rivera]] and passed the Assembly consecutively for 5 years. Timothy's Law was sent to the governor on December 13, 2006 who later signed it into law. A condition of Timothy's Law passing the NY State legislature was it have a 2-year [[sunset provision|sunset clause]] to provide for an actuarial study on the cost effectiveness (the shortest sunset of any law in NY history). Timothy's Law became effective January 1, 2007.&lt;ref name="O'Clair"/&gt; In May, 2009, the Superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department released the actuarial study on the cost effectiveness of Timothy's Law, and reported that the law had considerably increased mental health parity at a nominal cost to employers. It stated that neither consumers nor brokers viewed the mandates as a significant issue relative to cost or their overall purchasing decision.&lt;ref name="report1"/&gt;

After both houses of the NYS Legislature voted to make Timothy's Law permanent in the 2009 session, Governor Patterson signed the bill into law on July 11, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysenate.gov/blogs/2009/jul/02/senate-passes-one-hundred-critical-bills-updated-72009 Senate Passes One Hundred Critical Bills] New York Senate Blog (2009-07).

Insurance Department Report (2009-05). Retrieved on 2009-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major provisions==
The legislation included several provisions that affect the way health insurers in the state cover mental health services.

*Coverage must be included in plans for at least 30 days of inpatient care and at least 20 days of outpatient treatment with a [[psychiatrist]] or [[psychologist]] in a state-certified facility, a facility operated by the state, or a group or academic practice.
*Plans must have premiums and patient cost-sharing for services that are consistent with the costs for physical treatments.
*Plans for employers with 50 or more eligible employees must provide unlimited coverage for [[biologically based mental illness]]es, defined as [[schizophrenia]]/[[psychotic disorder]]s, [[major depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[delusional disorder]]s, [[panic disorder]], [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder]], [[bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]], and [[binge eating]]. Plans for employers with 49 or less employees must offer this coverage as an option.
*Children under age 18 must be covered for serious [[suicide|suicidal]] symptoms or other life-threatening self-destructive behaviors, significant psychotic symptoms, behavior caused by emotional disturbance that places the child at risk of causing personal injury or significant property damage, or behavior caused by emotional disturbances that place the child at substantial risk of removal from the household.
*The law requires the state to develop a method to help small employers pay for the additional biologically-based coverage if elected.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news

[[Image:Bear hunting Kodiak FWS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hunter with a bear's head and hide strapped to his back on the [[Kodiak Archipelago]]]]

'''Trophy hunting''' is [[hunting]] of [[wild game]] for human recreation. The trophy is the animal or part of the animal kept, and usually displayed, to represent the success of the hunt. The game sought is typically a large or impressively ornamented male, such as one having large horns or antlers. Generally, only parts of the animal are kept as a trophies (usually the head, skin, horns or antlers) and the carcass itself is used for food or donated to the local community.

Trophies are often displayed in the hunter's home or office, and often in specially designed "trophy rooms," sometimes called "game rooms" or "gun rooms," in which the hunter's weaponry is displayed as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/news/article.asp?docKey=600-200910110625KRTRIB__BUSNEWS_62982-2SO76MJGKK56MUPV67QJKEVUF2&amp;params=timestamp%7C%7C10/11/2009%206:25%20AM%20ET%7C%7Cheadline%7C%7COn%20the%20hunt%20for%20a%20gun%20room%3F%3A%20Business%20celebrates%20a%20love%20of%20firearms%2C%20hunting%20big%20animals%20%5BThe%20Hutchinson%20News%2C%20Kan.%5D%7C%7CdocSource%7C%7CKnight%20Ridder/Tribune%7C%7Cprovider%7C%7CACQUIREMEDIA&amp;ric=MHP Business Week] On the hunt for a gun room?: Business celebrates a love of firearms, hunting big animals, Knight Ridder, 10/11/2009 (retrieved 10/11/2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Trophy hunting has both firm supporters and strong opponents. Debates surrounding trophy hunting centrally concern not only the question of the morality of recreational hunting and supposed conservation efforts of big-game and ranch hunting, but also the observed decline in animal species that are targets for trophy hunting.

== Types of trophy hunting ==

=== Ranch hunting ===
Ranch hunting is a form of big-game hunting where the animals hunted are specifically bred on a ranch for trophy hunting purposes.

Many species of game such as the Indian [[blackbuck]], [[nilgai]], [[chital|axis deer]], [[barasingha]], the [[Iranian red sheep]], and variety of other species of deer, sheep, and antelope from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific islands were introduced to ranches in Texas and Florida for the sake of trophy hunting.

These animals are typically hunted on a fee for each kill, with hunters paying $4,000 or more to be able to hunt exotic game.&lt;ref name="huntingtexastrophies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntingtexastrophies.com/texas-hunting-packages/exotic-hunting/|title=Exotic Hunting &amp;#124; Texas' Best Exotic Hunting Ranch &amp;#124; V-Bharre Ranch &amp;#124; Texas&amp;#039; Premier Hunting Ranch &amp;#124; V-Bharre Ranch|publisher=huntingtexastrophies.com|accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="continentalranchtexas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.continentalranchtexas.com/exotics.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011219150441/http://continentalranchtexas.com/exotics.htm |archive-date=2001-12-19 |dead-url=yes |title=Texas Exotic Hunting - Texas trophy exotic hunting in West TX. |accessdate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As many of these species are endangered or threatened in their native habitat, the United States' government requires 10% of the hunting fee to be given to conservation efforts in the areas where these animals are indigenous. Hunting of endangered animals in the United States is normally illegal under the [[Endangered Species Act]], but is permitted on these ranches since the rare animals hunted there are not indigenous to the United States.

The [[Humane Society of the United States]] has criticized these ranches and their hunters with the reasoning that they are still hunting endangered animals even if the animals were raised specifically to be hunted.

=== African trophy hunting ===
Trophy hunting has been practiced in Africa and is still a practiced in many African countries. According to a study sponsored by International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation (CIC) in partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the revenue generated by hunting tourism in seven Southern African Development Communities (SADC) in 2008 was approximately 190 million USD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cic-wildlife.org/fileadmin/Press/Technical_Series/EN/8_.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an opinion piece by Jeff Flocken of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, he states that "despite the wild claims that trophy hunting brings millions of dollars in revenue to local people in otherwise poor communities, there is no proof of this. Even pro-hunting organizations like the [[International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation]] have reported that only 3 percent of revenue from trophy hunting ever makes it to the communities affected by hunting. The rest goes to national governments or foreign-based outfitters. The money that does come into Africa from hunting pales in comparison to the billions generated from tourists who come just to watch wildlife. If lions and other animals continue to disappear from Africa, this vital source of income—nonconsumptive tourism—will end, adversely impacting people all over Africa."&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130802-lions-trophy-hunting-extinction-opinion-animals-africa-conservation/|title=Opinion: Why Are We Still Hunting Lions?|publisher=news.nationalgeographic.com|accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, South African Environmental Affairs Minister, [[Edna Molewa]], contradicts Flocken's conclusions by stating that the hunting industry has contributed millions to South Africa's economy in past years. In the 2010 hunting season, total revenue of approximately R1.1 billion was generated by the local and trophy hunting industries collectively. "This amount only reflects the revenue generated through accommodation and species fees. The true revenue is therefore substantially higher, as this amount does not even include revenue generated through the associated industries as a result of the multiplier effect," according to Molewa.&lt;ref&gt;http://mg.co.za/article/2012-10-30-molewa-hunting-brings-much-to-south-africas-economy&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North American trophy hunting ===
After the attention gained from the [[Killing of Cecil the lion]], activists{{Who|date=January 2017}} turned to North American wildlife, in particular the [[cougar]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The cougar, also called the mountain lion, puma, or panther, is hunted for sport across its expansive habitat.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} According to the Washington, the only federally protected populations in the country are the [[Florida panther]] and the [[Eastern cougar]], believed to be extinct.&lt;ref name="CBD"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eastern Puma Declared Extinct, Removed From Endangered Species List |publisher=Center for Biological Diversity |url=http://www.planetexperts.com/eastern-puma-declared-extinct-removed-from-endangered-species-list/ |date=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states—including Colorado, Utah and Washington—in recent years have proposed an increase in cougar hunting for various reasons, such as the desire to decrease human and livestock conflicts and/or to increase native deer populations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} California is the only state throughout the West that prohibits cougar hunting.&lt;ref&gt;SABALOW, RYAN AND PHILLIP REESE.

The [[Boone and Crockett Club]], North America's oldest wildlife conservation group, used the selective harvest of older males to aid in the recovery of many big game species which were on the brink of extinction at the turn of the 20th century. The organization continues to promote this practice today, and monitors conservation success through its Big Game Records data set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Boone and Crockett Club|title=BIG GAME TROPHIES AND TROPHY HUNTING|url=https://www.boone-crockett.org/about/positions_BigGameTrophies.asp |website=Boone and Crockett Club|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American trophy hunting should not be confused with [[canned hunting]] or "vanity hunting," which involves the shooting of genetically manipulated and selectively bred animals for the sole purpose of collecting an animal for display. The [[Boone and Crockett Club]] disavows this practice and actively campaigns against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boone and Crockett Club|title=Hunting Ethics|url=https://www.boone-crockett.org/huntingEthics/ethics_cannedshoot.asp?area=huntingEthics|website=Boone and Crockett Club|publisher=Boone and Crockett Club|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal standing ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2017}}
Trophy hunting is legal in many countries {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}; however, there are restrictions on the species that can be hunted, when hunting can take place, and the weapons that can be used. Permits and government consent are also required. Specific laws of trophy hunting vary based on the criteria mentioned, and some areas have even banned trophy hunting all together. Specific laws{{Clarify|Such as?|date=January 2017}} of trophy hunting usually concern endangered animals in an effort to protect them from extinction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In 1973, the United States passed a law called the Endangered Species Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/esa-history.html|title=Endangered Species Program {{!}} Laws &amp; Policies {{!}} Endangered Species Act {{!}} A History of the Endangered Species Act of 1973|last=Program|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service/Endangered Species|website=www.fws.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was meant to stop hunting and trafficking of many endangered species in the U.S. that are looked at as prized by many hunters such as the Wood Bison and Polar Bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/pub/SpeciesReport.do?groups=A&amp;listingType=L&amp;mapstatus=1|title=Species Search Results|last=Service|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife|website=ecos.fws.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanzania has an estimated 40 per cent of the population of lions. Its wildlife authorities defend their success in keeping such numbers (as compared to countries like Kenya, where lion numbers have plummeted dramatically) as linked to the use of trophy hunting as a conservation tool{{How|date=October 2016}}. According to Alexander N. Songorwa, director of wildlife for the Tanzanian Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, trophy hunting generated roughly $75&amp;nbsp;million for Tanzania's economy from 2008 to 2011.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/opinion/saving-lions-by-killing-them.html|title=The New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 paper by Nigel Leader-Williams and colleagues in the ''Journal of International Wildlife Law and Policy'' asserted that the legalization of white rhinoceros hunting in South Africa motivated private landowners to reintroduce the species onto their lands. As a result, white rhinos increased from fewer than one hundred individuals to more than 11,000.&lt;ref name="conservationmagazine.org"&gt;http://conservationmagazine.org/2014/01/can-trophy-hunting-reconciled-conservation/&lt;/ref&gt; Leader-Williams's study also showed that trophy hunting in Zimbabwe doubled wildlife areas relative to state protected areas. The implementation of controlled and legalized hunting led to an increase in the area of suitable land available to elephants and other wildlife, which "reversed the problem of habitat loss and helping to maintain a sustained population increase in Zimbabwe's already large elephant population."&lt;ref name="conservationmagazine.org"/&gt;

A scientific study in the journal, ''Biological Conservation'' by Diogo Andrade, states that trophy hunting is of "major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas, including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism."&lt;ref name="africanwildlifeconservationfund.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Economic-and-conservation-significance.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117050938/http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Economic-and-conservation-significance.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial incentives from trophy hunting effectively more than double the land area that is used for wildlife conservation, relative to what would be conserved relying on national parks alone, according to the study published in ''Biological Conservation''.&lt;ref name="africanwildlifeconservationfund.org"/&gt;

According to the American writer and journalist [[Richard Conniff]], if Namibia is home to 1,750 of the roughly 5,000 black rhinos surviving in the wild, it's because it allows trophy hunting. Namibia's mountain zebra population has increased from 1,000 in 1982 to 27,000 in 2014. Elephants, which are gunned down elsewhere for their ivory, have gone from 15,000 to 20,000 in 1995. Lions, which were on the brink of extinction "from Senegal to Kenya", are increasing in Namibia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/opinion/a-trophy-hunt-thats-good-for-rhinos.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Financial support of conservation efforts ====
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] recognizes that trophy hunting, when well-managed, can be sustainable and generate significant economic incentives for the conservation of target species and their habitats outside of protected areas.&lt;ref name="cmsdata.iucn.org"&gt;IUCN Species Survival Commission (2012). [http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_ssc_guiding_principles_on_trophy_hunting_ver1_09aug2012.pdf Guiding Principles on Trophy Hunting as a Tool for Creating Conservation Incentives].&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the journal ''Animal Conservation''&lt;ref name="conservationmagazine.org" /&gt; and led by Peter Lindsey of Kenya's Mpala Research Centre concluded that most trophy hunters assure that they are concerned about the conservation, ethical, and social issues that hunting raises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindsey | first1 = PA | last2 = Alexander | first2 = R | last3 = Frank | first3 = LG | last4 = Mathieson | first4 = A | last5 = Romanach | first5 = SS | year = 2006 | title = Potential of trophy hunting to create incentives for wildlife conservation in Africa where alternative wildlife-based land uses may not be viable | url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2006.00034.x | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 283–291 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.2006.00034.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study interviewed 150 Americans who had hunted in Africa before, or who planned to do so within three years. For example, hunters assure that they were much less willing to hunt in areas where [[African wild dogs]] or [[cheetahs]] were illegally shot than their hunting operators perceived, and they also showed greater concern for social issues than their operators realized, with a huge willingness to hunt in areas were local people lived and benefited from hunting (Fig.1). Eighty-six percent of hunters told the researchers they preferred hunting in an area where they knew that a portion of the proceeds went back into local communities.&lt;ref name="conservationmagazine.org" /&gt; A certification system could therefore allow hunters to select those operators who benefit local people and conduct themselves in a conservation-friendly manner.&lt;ref name="lindsey1" /&gt;

=== In America ===
Cougar hunting quotas have had a negative effect on the animals' population but also, the people in the surrounding communities.{{Clarify|date=December 2016}} According to Robert Wieglus, director of Large Carnivore Conservation Lab at Washington State University, when too many cougars are killed demographic issues can be seen in the cat's population. The male cougar is extremely territorial and will often seek out females in the territory to both mate and kill any cubs to ensure room for their own offspring. Oftentimes these are young "teenage" males who are hormonal and unpredictable.

These "teenage" lions are mostly responsible for killed livestock and unwanted human interaction. In addition, they often drive females with cubs into hiding or new territory, forcing the females to hunt new prey they did not before.

"Basically the bottom line was this heavy hunting of cougars was actually causing all the problems we were seeing," Wielgus said of his work in Washington.&lt;ref name="Cruise"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Is Trophy Hunting Helping Save African Elephants?|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151715-conservation-trophy-hunting-elephants-tusks-poaching-zimbabwe-namibia/|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-11-23|first = Adam|last = Cruise|first2 = for National Geographic PUBLISHED Tue Nov 17 14:42:31 EST|last2 = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]], trophy hunting "provides an economic incentive" for ranchers to continue to breed those species, and that hunting "reduces the threat of the species' extinction".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/2005/05-17432.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-hunting-endangered-animals-save-the-species/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alces alces elan trophee chateau Tanlay.jpg|thumbnail|[[Moose]] head and deer [[antler]]s mounted as hunting trophies]]
According to Dr G.C. Dry, former President of Wildlife Ranching South Africa, wildlife ranches have contributed greatly to the South African economy. In his paper "COMMERCIAL WILDLIFE RANCHING’S CONTRIBUTION TO THE GREEN ECONOMY", he states that "commercial wildlife ranching is about
appropriate land-use and rural development; it is less about animals per se, not a white affluent issue, not a conservation at-all-cost
issue, but about economic sustainability". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sawma.co.za/images/Dry_Gert_Full_paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Dry's paper concludes that "It is a land-use option that is
ecologically appropriate, economically sustainable, politically sensitive, and finally, socially just", however no references or sources are provided for the data used.

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] reports in "The baby and the bathwater:
trophy hunting, conservation and rural livelihoods", that trophy hunting, when well-managed, can be sustainable and generate significant economic incentives for the conservation of target species, but that there are valid concerns about the legality, sustainability and ethics of some hunting practices. The paper concludes that "in some contexts, there may be valid and
feasible alternatives to trophy hunting that can deliver the above-mentioned benefits, but identifying, funding and implementing these requires genuine consultation and engagement with affected governments, the private sector and communities. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.iucn.org/sites/dev/files/trophy_hunting_conservation_and_rural_livelihoods.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulations, ban and effects ==
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service imposed a ban on imports. This ban is limited to elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Tanzania for 2014–2015 and likely going to extend and expand.&lt;ref name="Cruise"/&gt;

In 2001, [[Botswana]] instituted a one year ban on lion hunting.&lt;ref name="dark-star"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Theroux |first1=Paul |title=Dark Star Safari: Overland from Cairo to Capetown |date=April 5, 2004 |location=Mariner Books |page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had previously permitted the hunting of fifty lions each year, which caused a shortage in mature males in the population, as the hunters preferred the lions with the largest manes.&lt;ref name="guardian-bots"&gt;{{cite news |last1=McGreal |first1=Chris |title=Lions face new threat: they're rich, American and they've got guns |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/27/usa.highereducation |accessdate=4 June 2018 |publisher=The Guardian |date=27 Apr 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ban, [[Safari Club International]] including prominent member, former President [[George H. W. Bush]] successfully lobbied the Botswanan government to reverse the ban.&lt;ref name="dark-star" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-bots" /&gt;

Botswana again banned trophy hunting in 2014, and now villagers claim they get no income from trophy hunters, suffer from damaged crop fields caused by elephants and buffaloes, and lions killing their [[livestock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A Hunting Ban Saps a Village's Livelihood|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/world/a-hunting-ban-saps-a-villages-livelihood.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-09-12|access-date = 2015-09-13|issn = 0362-4331|first = Norimitsu|last = Onishi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some conservationists claim trophy hunting is more effective for wildlife management than a complete hunting ban.

In the wake of the killing of Cecil the lion, Emirates Airlines, American Airlines, Delta, and United Airlines have all banned the transportation of hunting trophies on flights.

On the contrary, Kenya, which banned trophy hunting in 1977, has seen a 70 percent decline of wild animals according to Laurence Frank, a zoology researcher at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] and director of the conservation group ''Living with Lions''. Because the government has no incentive to protect wild animals, effective enforcement on protecting animals has been a disaster according to Frank.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/04/opinion/the-ethics-of-safari-hunting-in-africa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 article by P. Lindsey and G. Balme{{Clarify|date=December 2016}}, if lion hunting was effectively precluded, trophy hunting could potentially become financially unviable across at least 59,538&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that could result in a concomitant loss of habitat{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

However, the loss of lion hunting could have other potentially broader negative impacts including reduction of competitiveness of wildlife-based land uses relative to ecologically unfavorable alternatives.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Restrictions on lion hunting may also reduce tolerance for the species among communities where local people benefit from trophy hunting, and may reduce funds available for anti-poaching.&lt;ref name="plosone"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029332|title=PLOS ONE: The Significance of African Lions for the Financial Viability of Trophy Hunting and the Maintenance of Wild Land|publisher=plosone.org|accessdate=2014-02-22|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029332|volume=7|journal=PLoS ONE|pages=e29332|pmid=22247772|pmc=3256150 | last1 = Lindsey | first1 = PA | last2 = Balme | first2 = GA | last3 = Booth | first3 = VR | last4 = Midlane | first4 = N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
=== Opposition ===
==== Arguments====
[[File:Hippo Trophy-2.jpg|thumb|252x252px|Trophy hunter With hippopotamus prize (Zambia, May 2010).]]

Opponents voice strong opinions against trophy hunting based on the belief that it is immoral and lacks financial contribution to the communities affected by trophy hunting and to conservation efforts. ''[[National Geographic]]'', for example, published a report in 2015 which says government corruption, especially in Zimbabwe, prevents elephant hunting fees from going towards any conservation efforts, with authorities keeping the fees for themselves. Governments also take more wildlife areas to profit from poaching and trophy hunting. Similarly, a 2017 report by the Australian-based Economists at Large says that trophy hunting amounted to less than one percent of tourism revenue in eight African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Ingraham|first=Christopher|date=November 17, 2017 |title=The Fish and Wildlife Service said we have to kill elephants to help save them. The data says otherwise.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/17/the-trump-administration-says-we-have-to-kill-elephants-to-help-save-them-the-data-says-otherwise/|work=[[The Washington Post]] |location= |access-date=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an IUCN report from 2009, surrounding communities in West Africa receive little benefit from the hunting-safari business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Morell |first=Virginia |date=November 18, 2017 |title=What Trophy Hunting Does to the Elephants It Leaves Behind|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/elephant-trophy-hunting-psychology-emotions/546293/|work=[[The Atlantic]] |location= |access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents also cite that the genetic health and social behaviors of species is adversely affected because hunters often kill the largest or most significant male of a species.  The removal the most significant animals (because of the size of their horns or mane for example) can severely affect the health of a species population. As Dr Rob Knell states 'Because these high-quality males with large secondary sexual traits tend to father a high proportion of the offspring, their 'good genes' can spread rapidly, so populations of strongly sexually selected animals can adapt quickly to new environments. Removing these males reverses this effect and could have serious and unintended consequences. If the population is having to adapt to a new environment and you remove even a small proportion of these high quality males, you could drive it to extinction.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-42152393|title=Trophy hunting removes 'good genes'|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=2017-11-29|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources]] in 2016 concluded that trophy hunting may be contributing to the [[extinction]] of certain animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Jada F. |date=June 13, 2016 |title=Trophy Hunting Fees Do Little to Help Threatened Species, Report Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/politics/trophy-hunting-fees-do-little-to-help-threatened-species-report-says.html?_r=1| work=[[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date=March 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nnimmo Bassey]], Nigerian environmental activist and director of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation, asserted in November 2017 that "wildlife in Africa have been decimated by trophy hunters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date= November 16, 2017|title=African Activist Slams Trump for Reversing Ban on Elephant Trophies from Hunts in Zimbabwe &amp; Zambia|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2017/11/16/african_activist_slams_trump_for_reversing|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|location= |access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservationist groups such as [[IFAW]] and [[HSUS]] assert that trophy hunting is a key factor in the "silent extinction" of giraffes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Milman|first=Oliver |date=April 19, 2017 |title=Giraffes must be listed as endangered, conservationists formally tell US|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/19/giraffes-endangered-species-conservation-hunting|work=The Guardian |location= |access-date=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Stances ====
Many of the 189 countries signatory to the 1992 Rio Accord have developed biodiversity action plans that discourage the hunting of protected species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flaflooga.com/trophy_hunting.php |title=Arguments against trophy hunting |accessdate=2007-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710234644/http://flaflooga.com/trophy_hunting.php |archivedate=2015-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trophy hunting is also opposed by the group [[In Defense of Animals]] (IDA) on the basis that trophy hunters are not aimed at conservation, they are instead aimed at glory in hunting and killing the biggest and rarest animals. They contend that the trophy hunters are not interested in even saving endangered animals, and are more than willing to pay the very high prices for permits to kill members of an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Trophy Hunting - - In Defense of Animals|url = http://www.idausa.org/campaigns/wild-free2/habitats-campaign/anti-hunting/hunters/trophy-hunting/|website = - In Defense of Animals|accessdate = 2015-11-23|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] is also opposed to trophy hunting on the basis that it is unnecessary and cruel. The opposition from PETA is on the basis of the moral justification of hunting for sport. The pain that the animals suffer is not justified by the enjoyment that the hunters receive.

The [[League Against Cruel Sports]] also opposes trophy hunting for the reason that even if the animal that is being hunted for a trophy is not endangered, it is still unjustified to kill them. They respond to claims of economic benefits as false justifications for the continuance of the inhumane sport.

The [[David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust]], an elephant conservation organization, believe that elephants bring in significantly more revenue from tourists who want to see them alive. Their 2013 report stated "alive, they benefit local communities and economies; dead they benefit criminal and even terrorist groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebbs |first=Stephanie |date=November 17, 2017|title=Does hunting elephants help conserve the species?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/hunting-elephants-conserve-species/story?id=51194213|work=[[ABC News]] |location= |access-date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iworry.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Dead-or-Alive-Final-LR.pdf|title=Dead or Alive?

=== Support ===
==== Arguments====
Proponents{{Who|date=December 2016}} of trophy hunting claim many hunting fees go toward conservation, such as portions of [[hunting license]] fees, hunting tags and ammunition taxes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In addition, private groups, such as the [[National Shooting Sports Foundation]], which contributed more than $400,000 in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nssf.org/news/PR_idx.cfm?PRloc=common/PR/&amp;PR=061405.cfm State Agencies Receive Over $420,000 in Grants Through Hunting Heritage Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt; and smaller private groups also contribute significant funds; for example, the Grand Slam Club Ovis has raised more than $6.3&amp;nbsp;million to date for the conservation of sheep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildsheep.org/conservation/funding.htm Grand Slam Club Ovis]&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of [[Panthera Corporation|Panthera]], a conservation group for big cats and their ecosystems, argues that trophy hunting gives African governments economic incentives to leave safari blocks as wilderness, and that hunting remains the most effective tool to protect wilderness in many parts of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.panthera.org/node/1253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.panthera.org/node/249&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations that are neutral and do not oppose trophy hunting include [[The National Audubon Society]], [[Defenders of Wildlife]], and [[The Sierra Club]]&lt;ref name="nssf.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="animalliberationfront.com" /&gt;

=== Proposed solutions ===
==== Certificate system ====
One proposed solution to these problems is the development of a certification system, whereby hunting operators are rated on three criteria:&lt;ref name="lindsey1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis D &amp; Jackson J. (2005). Safari hunting and conservation on communal land in southern Africa. Pages&amp;nbsp;239–251 in R. Woodroffe, S. Thirgood, and A. Rabinowitz, editors. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6vNzRzcjntAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=People+and+wildlife:+conflict+or+coexistence&amp;ots=j48RzOSp6c&amp;sig=ukDFjG_9dSiVJDbPqwpKm20_md8#v=onepage&amp;q=People%20and%20wildlife%3A%20conflict%20or%20coexistence&amp;f=false People and wildlife: conflict or coexistence?] Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Their commitment to conservation, e.g. by adhering to quotas and contributing to [[anti-poaching]] efforts.
# How much they benefit and involve local people.
# Whether they comply with agreed ethical standards.

===== Challenges to the certificate system =====
Introducing a certification system however remains challenging because it requires co-operation between hunting operators, conservationists and governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = F | last2 = Lindsey | first2 = PA | last3 = Balme | first3 = G | year = 2013 | title = hunting and lion conservation: a question of governance? | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=9016211&amp;fileId=S003060531200035XTrophy | journal = Oryx | volume = 47 | issue = 4| pages = 501–509 | doi=10.1017/s003060531200035x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Selier | first1 = SJ | last2 = Page | first2 = BR | last3 = Vanak | first3 = AT | last4 = Slotow | first4 = R | year = 2014 | title = Sustainability of elephant hunting across international borders in southern Africa: A case study of the greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.641/full | journal = Journal of Wildlife Management | volume = 78 | issue = 1| pages = 122–132 | doi=10.1002/jwmg.641}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also requires difficult questions to be answered, including; what constitutes ethical hunting? Who constitutes local communities and what represents adequate benefits for them?&lt;ref name="lindsey1" /&gt; Some researchers also continue to express concern that allowing trophy hunts for [[endangered]] animals might send the wrong message to influential people around the world, perhaps with adverse consequences for conservation. For example, it has been suggested that people will contribute less money to conservation organizations because allowing hunting of a species could suggest that it does not need saving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckley | first1 = R | year = 2014 | title = Mixed signals from hunting rare wildlife | url = http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/14.WB.008 | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 12 | issue = 6| pages = 321–322 | doi=10.1890/14.WB.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
{{See|Killing of Cecil the lion}}
The controversy surrounding trophy hunting was further ignited when an American dentist Walter Palmer gained internet infamy when a picture of him and the dead lion Cecil went viral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = American Public Roars After It Gets a Glimpse of International Trophy Hunting of Lions · A Humane Nation|url = http://blog.humanesociety.org/wayne/2015/07/cecil-lion-killed-by-trophy-hunter.html|website = A Humane Nation|accessdate = 2015-11-21|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmer is an experienced and avid big-game hunter and reportedly paid over 50,000 US dollars to hunt and kill the lion.

Cecil the lion was one of the most known and studied lions in Zimbabwe. The lion was lured from the park and, after being injured by an arrow and stalked for 40 hours, Cecil was finally killed. Palmer was reportedly attracted to Cecil's rare black mane. Had Cecil been in the park, it would have been illegal to kill him. The actions the dentist and his hired hunter took in luring out of the park were not endorsed by trophy hunting officials in Zimbabwe. While Zimbabwe courts initially ruled his killing to be illegal, charges were ultimately dropped against the hunter Palmer hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/11/wildlife-watch-cecil-lion-hunter-charges-dropped|title= Charges Dropped Against Professional Hunter|date=11 November 2016|work=National Geographic|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of people went on social media sites to condemn Palmer's actions. Responses included Facebook pages such as "Shame Lion Killer Walter Palmer and River Bluff Dental."

=== Statistics ===
Trophy hunters imported over 1.26 million trophies into the [[United States|United States of America]] in the 10 years from 2005 to 2014. [[Canada]] was the leading source of imported trophies.

The '''Water supply and sanitation services in Portugal''' have seen important advances in access to services, technologies used and service quality over the past decades (1980s&amp;ndash;1990s), partially achieved thanks to important funds from the [[European Union]]. Nevertheless, sanitation still remains relatively low in mountain rural areas and some people have their own sources of water controlled by municipalities.

During the 1990s [[Portugal]] has put in place a modern institutional framework for the sector, which includes a national regulatory agency ([http://www.ersar.pt/website/ ERSAR] - The Water and Waste Services Regulation Authority) and multi-municipal water and sanitation companies.

== Access ==

In Portugal 93% of households have access to drinking water through house connections (97% in urban areas, but only 50% in rural areas) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wssinfo.org/pdf/country/PRT_wat.pdf WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005102535/http://www.wssinfo.org/pdf/country/PRT_wat.pdf |date=5 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
76% of households have access to sewer connections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irar.pt/presentationlayer/artigo_00.aspx?canalid=2&amp;artigoid=52&amp;idioma=1 Entidade Reguladora de Águas e Resíduos (ERSAR)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service quality ==

=== Drinking water ===

Water supply is continuous, except during droughts.

Drinking water quality is not consistently good, especially in smaller systems. Portugal does not comply with a series of drinking water parameters (iron, manganese, total coliforms, [[faecal coliforms]], faecal [[streptococci]] and [[clostridium]]) laid down in the [[EU water policy|EU drinking water directive]]. For example, almost 50% of water supply zones do not comply as regards total [[coliform]]s, while 20% of the zones do not comply with the faecal coliforms parameter.&lt;ref name="EU Press Release March 2007"&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/07/393&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en EU Press Release March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wastewater ===

Portugal does not yet fully comply with EU regulations on wastewater discharges. Even where [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] exist they do not always function properly. Especially in cities with combined sewers, treatment plants do not function properly after heavy rains. Sewer overflows during heavy rains are frequent, partly due to unauthorized storm water drain connections to the sewer system.

For example, in [[Lisbon]], the waste water treatment plant of Alcântara was not operational in 2007; then refurbished in 2011. In [[Matosinhos]] in the region of [[Porto]], only primary (basic) treatment is in place. In Costa de Aveiro ([[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], 60% of the polluting load generated is not collected and 65% is not treated. In [[Póvoa de Varzim]]/[[Vila do Conde]], 60% of the load is not collected and the level of treatment in place is unknown.&lt;ref name="EU Press Release March 2007"/&gt;

In some beaches bathing is restricted because of pollution.

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==

=== Policy and regulation ===
The [http://www.maotdr.gov.pt/ Ministry of Environment and Regional Development] is in charge of sector policies. As in many other countries, water and sanitation is not a political priority. Political actions at the local level are often oriented at the short-term, following electoral cycles, with limited long-term planning. Nevertheless, there has been remarkable stability of the national policy framework independent of electoral cycles.

In 1997 Portugal created a national regulatory agency, which is now called the [http://www.ersar.pt/ Water and Waste Services Regulation Authority ''Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços de Águas e Resíduos'' (ERSAR)]. ERSAR is in charge of water supply, wastewater and solid waste management. Its attributions include the economic regulation of service providers, as well as the regulation of their service quality, including water quality. The regulatory agency is directed by a three-member Board, whose members are appointed upon the recommendation of the Minister of Environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irar.pt/presentationlayer/artigo_00.aspx?canalid=1&amp;artigoid=7 Entidade Reguladora de Águas e Resíduos (ERSAR) Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

Water resources management is the responsibility of the [http://www.inag.pt/inag2004/port/quem_somos/atribui.html Water Institute INAG], created in 1993 under the Ministry of Environment and Regional Development. INAG operates, among others, on the basis of the [http://www.inag.pt/inag2004/port/divulga/legisla/pdf_nac/Lei%2058_2005.pdf 2005 Water Law], which transposes the [[EU water policy|EU water framework directive]] into national law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirandalawfirm.com/Docs/Articles/AO_ILO_Portugal.pdf Summary of Water Law by Miranda Law Firm]&lt;/ref&gt; Portugal has drawn up a National Water Plan and 15 River Basin Plans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/csd/csd13/statements/2104_portugal.pdf Speech by the Minister of Environment at the UN in 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service provision ===
Provision of water and sanitation services in Portugal is a shared responsibility between the 308 municipalities and the national, public holding company [[Águas de Portugal]] (AdP) and its subsidiaries. About 73% of the population in 243 municipalities receives water directly from municipalities (3.5 million people) or single-municipality companies established under public law (2.5 million people). 27% of the population receives water ''directly'' from companies established under private law, including 1.7 million from multi-municipal companies majority-owned by [[Águas de Portugal]] and 0.9 million from other municipal companies established under private law. Many municipalities do not control their sources of bulk water supply. Companies established under private law, in particular multi-municipal companies co-owned by [[Águas de Portugal]], thus sell water to municipalities, providing water indirectly in bulk to 53% of the population. In addition, as mentioned above, companies established under private law provide water directly to 27% of the population. Thus, a total of about 80% of the population receives water directly or indirectly multi-municipal companies established under private law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portugal.gov.pt/NR/rdonlyres/2E4F1B13-B462-4EE7-927C-0D0F41BF129B/0/PEAASARII.pdf PEAASAR], p. 17 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314153529/http://www.portugal.gov.pt/NR/rdonlyres/2E4F1B13-B462-4EE7-927C-0D0F41BF129B/0/PEAASARII.pdf |date=14 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently of whether utilities are established under public or private law, all infrastructure is publicly owned. There is only limited private sector participation in the provision of water and sanitation services. Storm water drainage is directly provided by the municipalities.

==== Municipalities ====
According to the local government law (Lei das autarquias locais) the country’s 308 [[Municipalities of Portugal|municipalities]] are responsible for providing water supply and sanitation services, either directly or indirectly through concessions. Decree-law 379/93 of 1993 establishes the legal basis for concessions to municipal and multi-municipal water and sanitation companies established under private law (typically publicly owned shareholder companies that are part of AdP). As mentioned above, these have come into widespread use in Portugal ever since.

==== Águas de Portugal ====
{{main|Águas de Portugal}}
With total assets amounting to around €7.5 billion, the AdP Group is the largest entity operating in the environmental sector in Portugal. The [http://www.adp.pt/en/ AdP Group] was founded in 1993 and set the mission of developing multi-municipal water supply and wastewater sanitation systems and currently providing services to over 80% of the Portuguese population. The core activity involves the integrated management of the urban [[water cycle]] and spanning all of its respective phases, ranging from the capture, treatment and distribution of water for public consumption to the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of urban and industrial wastewaters and including their recycling and reutilisation. Through its different companies, the group has a nationwide presence, providing services to municipalities that simultaneously serve as shareholders in the companies managing multi-municipal systems (“upstream” systems), and directly serving the populations through municipal systems (“downstream” systems) providing water and sanitation systems.

In recent years, in association with local partners as well as other Portuguese companies in this sector, the group has undertaken a diverse range of projects in countries including Angola, Algeria, Brazil, Cape Verde, East Timor, Morocco, Mozambique and Sao Tome e Principe, whether in the format of technical assistance or the management of water and wastewater concessionary services. Currently, the group is present in Angola, where it set up a subsidiary in 2010; in Mozambique through its stake in Aquatec; and in various other countries following the signing of service provision and technical assistance contracts.

[[Image:Lisbon 3 of 3.jpg|thumb|800px|left|The capital of Portugal, [[Lisbon]], receives its drinking water from ''Empresa Portuguesa das Águas Livres, SA'' (EPAL), a subsidiary of [[Águas de Portugal]]]]

'''EPAL - the water company serving Lisbon''' [http://www.epal.pt/epal/EN/Modelo1.aspx?src=QuemSomos&amp;area=3276&amp;menu=3278 Empresa Portuguesa das Águas Livres, SA (EPAL)] is a special case. The water company serving Lisbon and surrounding municipalities is a fully owned subsidiary of Águas de Portugal, in charge of bulk water supply and of water distribution. EPAL is the company responsible for the delivery of water to households in the capital (Lisboa) where it has around 350,000 clients. In terms of its bulk operations, EPAL supplies water to 35 municipalities on the north bank of the river Tagus and, since 2015, delegated management responsibility for the multi-municipal water supply and sanitation systems of Lisbon and the Tagus Valley, which integrates 86 municipalities and a population of around 3.8 million inhabitants in a territorial area making up 33% of mainland Portugal.

== History ==

=== History since the 1970s ===
[[Image:Aqueduto das Águas Livres (1).jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Águas Livres Aqueduct]] supplied water to Lisbon until it was decommissioned in 1974]]
When Portugal emerged from years of dictatorship and the [[Carnation Revolution]]'s turmoil in 1974, the level of access to services, the technologies used and the service quality were far from optimal. In particular, most municipal wastewater was discharged without any treatment at that time. However, substantial improvements have been achieved since then, in particular after Portugal's adhesion to the [[European Community]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1986 which was accompanied by the gradual introduction of [[EU water policy|EU standards]] and financing by the [[European Investment Bank]], the introduction of multi-municipal utilities and the holding company ''Águas de Portugal'' in 1993, and the creation of a regulatory agency for the sector in 2000.

Portugal's membership of the European Community in 1986 and the [[EU water policy|EU Urban waste water framework directive of 1991]] triggered a series of reforms undertaken by the government of then Prime Minister [[Cavaco Silva]] in order to modernize the sector, to improve service quality and to effectively use EU funds destined to the sector. Until then service provision had been the sole responsibility of the municipalities, with the exception of the metropolitan area of Lisbon which was served by the multi-municipal company called ''Empresa Portuguesa das Águas Livres'' (EPAL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adp.pt/content/index.php?action=detailfo&amp;rec=1757&amp;t=Historia Águas de Portugal (AdP) History]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many municipalities were small and did not have the financial or human resources to modernize their water and sanitation services. Furthermore, the need to buy water from sources located in other municipalities and to lower costs by constructing wastewater treatment plants serving several municipalities, provided incentives for municipalities to cooperate.

Therefore, in 1993, the government introduced a policy to actively promote multi-municipal companies through Decree-law 379/93. The main vehicle to advance the reform process was the public Holding Company ''Águas de Portugal'' created in the same year, which was to be the majority owner of the newly created multi-municipal companies alongside with the participating municipalities. The government provided preferential access to EU structural funds to those municipalities that agreed to participate in the new multi-municipal companies, which were gradually created beginning in 1995. There was a strong continuity of sector policies, despite a change in government from the Social Democratic Party to the Socialist Party of Prime Minister [[António Guterres]] after the elections of 1995.

In 2000 the government published the first strategic plan for water and sanitation, further promoting the modernization of the sector and the consolidation of service provision. In the same year the regulatory agency IRAR began its work. Solid waste management was included in the purview of both AdP and IRAR, which was later renamed into ERSAR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adp.pt/files/26.jpg Águas de Portugal (AdP) Timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213015727/http://www.adp.pt/files/26.jpg |date=13 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sector policies continued to be stable after subsequent changes of government in the elections of 2002 won by the Social Democrats and of 2005 won by the Socialists. A judgment by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) of 29 September 2005 found against Portugal for not complying with a series of drinking water parameters laid down in the [[EU water policy|EU drinking water directive]]. In 2007 the government published its second strategic plan for water and sanitation.

=== Developments since 2007 ===

In March 2007 the [[European Commission]] launched infringement procedures against Portugal for not complying with three Court judgements on the quality of drinking water. It also referred Portugal to the [[European Court of Justice]] over its failure to implement the [[EU water policy|EU wastewater framework directive]].

Environment Commissioner [[Stavros Dimas]] said: "It is important that Portugal comply with these Court judgements, since they have a direct bearing on public health and the conservation of important natural areas. The Commission has no choice but to continue with legal action if we are to achieve the level of environmental protection intended in our legislation."&lt;ref name="EU Press Release March 2007"/&gt;

In 29 of the urban areas concerned by the directive, required collection and/or treatment systems are still not in place. For instance in [[Lisbon]], the waste water treatment plant of Alcântara is not operational. In [[Matosinhos]] in the region of [[Oporto]], only primary (basic) treatment is in place. In Costa de Aveiro, 60% of the polluting load generated is not collected and 65% is not treated. In Povoa de Varzim /Vila do Conde, 60% of the load was not collected and the level of treatment in place was unknown. In August 2010 a tertiary treatment plant started operating.(source missing)

Concerning drinking water, Portugal still does not comply with some of the parameters of the EU directive. For example, almost 50% of water supply zones do not comply as regards total [[coliform]]s, while 20% of the zones do not comply with the faecal coliforms parameter. The situation improved in 2004, the most recent year for which Portugal provided data.&lt;ref name="EU Press Release March 2007"/&gt;

== Tariffs and cost recovery ==
For regional companies water tariffs vary between 0.31 and 0.55 euro per cubic metre and sewer tariffs vary between 0.33 and 0.54 euro per cubic metre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irar.pt/presentationlayer/artigo_00.aspx?canalid=2&amp;artigoid=53&amp;idioma=1 Entidade Reguladora de Águas e Resíduos (ERSAR) Tariffs]&lt;/ref&gt; While in water supply systems cost recovery levels are satisfactory, the situation regarding sanitation is clearly unsustainable. The coastal urban regions show greater cost recovery ratios than the inland regions, especially regarding the Northeast region where the costs are higher and revenues are lower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/4237/1/MPRA_paper_4237.pdf Monteiro 2007 full text in Portuguese] and [http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/4237/ Summary in English]&lt;/ref&gt; A decree defining the water and sanitation tariff policy is being finalized in 2007. The decree determines the basic rules for tariff setting and aims at achieving full cost recovery, in line with the EU Water Framework Directive.

In 2010 the government was planning to set up a national tariff equilibrium fund to cross-subsidize utilities in the poorer inland regions with revenues from the wealthier coastal regions. The regulator ERSAR says that it is not aware of a similar mechanism anywhere else in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Global Water Intelligence:"Portugal looks to water tariff equilibrium", September 2010, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been protests against tariff increases under private concessions. For example, residents of [[Paços de Ferreira]], a municipality in northern Portugal, say that after the private company AGS took over their water system the price of water has gone up by around 6% every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Question for written answer to the Commission  Rule 117 João Ferreira (GUE/NGL)|title=Subject:  Public outrage at the privatisation of water services|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2012-011179+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=DE|accessdate=18 January 2013|date=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investment and finance ==

Many water systems in Portugal are quite old, so that there is a substantial requirement for infrastructure rehabilitation. From 2000 to 2006 investment needs in the sector were estimated at 4.23 billion euro, including 2.37 billion euro in bulk water supply and wastewater treatment (''vertem "baixa"'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portugal.gov.pt/NR/rdonlyres/2E4F1B13-B462-4EE7-927C-0D0F41BF129B/0/PEAASARII.pdf PEAASA], p. 11 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612141858/http://www.portugal.gov.pt/NR/rdonlyres/2E4F1B13-B462-4EE7-927C-0D0F41BF129B/0/PEAASARII.pdf |date=12 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual investments were in the same order of magnitude, but with a very different breakdown than expected: 3.4 billion euro, or 77% more than expected, had to be invested in bulk supply and wastewater treatment, mainly because cost estimates had been too low and because environmental standards had been tightened. Concerning investments in water distribution and sewers (''vertem "alta"''), they were only 0.9 billion euro and thus much lower than expected. Many of these investments had to be postponed because of lack of funding.&lt;ref&gt;PEAASA II, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

AdP by itself invested 588 million euro in 2006 alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adp.pt/content/index.php?action=detailfo&amp;rec=1755&amp;t=AdP-em-Numeros Águas de Portugal (AdP) Investments]&lt;/ref&gt; Grants from the [[European Regional Development Fund]] funded about 1.7 billion euro, or 40% of total investments in 2000-2006. Loans from the [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB) to Águas de Portugal and self-generated capital of the utilities funded the remainder of the investments. In October 2006 the EIB approved a 925 million euro loan for investments in eleven regional water and sanitation utilities in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eib.org/projects/press/2006/2006-103-eib-loan-for-water-management-throughout-portugal.htm European Investment Bank (EIB)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000 two mid-term national investment plans for the sector, PEAASAR  I 2000-2006 and PEAASAR II 2007-2013, have been approved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portugal.gov.pt/NR/rdonlyres/2E4F1B13-B462-4EE7-927C-0D0F41BF129B/0/PEAASARII.pdf PEAASAR II 2007-2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314153529/http://www.portugal.gov.pt/NR/rdonlyres/2E4F1B13-B462-4EE7-927C-0D0F41BF129B/0/PEAASARII.pdf |date=14 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such national sector investment plans are an interesting feature that is specific to Portugal and are not common in other EU countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5595">'''Wireless Medical Telemetry Service''' ('''WMTS''') is a wireless service specifically defined in the United States by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) for transmission of data related to a patient's health ([[biotelemetry]]).  It was created in 2000 because of interference issues due to establishment of [[digital television]].  The bands defined are 608-614&amp;nbsp;MHz, 1395-1400&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1427-1432&amp;nbsp;MHz.  Devices using these bands are typically proprietary.  Further, the use of these bands has not been internationally agreed to, so many times devices cannot be marketed or used freely in countries other than the United States. 

Because of this, in addition to WMTS, many manufacturers have created devices that transmit data in the [[ISM band]]s such as 902-928&amp;nbsp;MHz, and, more typically, 2.4-2.5&amp;nbsp;GHz, often using IEEE [[802.11]] or [[Bluetooth]] radios.

== FCC statements ==

There is an FCC statement on coexistence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=about&amp;id=wireless_medical_telemetry|title=FCC: Wireless Services: Wireless Medical Telemetry: About|work=fcc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; of WMTS in various frequency bands. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Prior to the establishment of the WMTS, medical telemetry devices generally could be operated on an unlicensed basis on vacant television channels 7-13 (174-216 MHz) and 14-46 (470-668 MHz) or on a licensed but secondary basis to private land mobile radio operations in the 450-470 MHz frequency band. This meant that wireless medical telemetry operations had to accept interference from the primary users of these frequency bands, i.e., the television broadcasters and private land mobile radio licensees. Further, if a wireless medical telemetry operation caused interference to television or private land mobile radio transmissions, the user of the wireless medical telemetry equipment would be responsible for rectifying the problem, even if that meant shutting down the medical telemetry operation.

The FCC was concerned that certain regulatory developments, including the advent of digital television (DTV) service, would result in more intensive use of these frequencies by the primary services, subjecting wireless medical telemetry operations to greater interference than before and perhaps precluding such operations entirely in many instances. To ensure that wireless medical telemetry devices can operate free of harmful interference, the FCC decided to establish the WMTS. In a Report and Order released on June 12, 2000, the FCC allocated a total of 14 megahertz of spectrum to WMTS on a primary basis. At the same time, it adopted a number of regulations to ensure that the WMTS frequencies are used effectively and efficiently for their intended medical purpose. The WMTS rules took effect on October 16, 2000
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== WMTS rules by FCC ==
Band Plan:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wireless.fcc.gov/services/index.htm?job=service_bandplan&amp;id=wireless_medical_telemetry|title=FCC: Wireless Services: Wireless Medical Telemetry: About: Band Plan|work=fcc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The frequencies currently allocated for WMTS are divided into three blocks: the 608-614 MHz frequency band (which corresponds to UHF TV channel 37 but is not used by any TV station because it is used for radio astronomy) and the 1395-1400 MHz and 1427-1432 MHz frequency bands (both of which had been used by the Federal Government but were reallocated to the private sector under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993). The frequencies in the 1427-1432 MHz band are shared by WMTS with non-medical telemetry operations, such as utility telemetry operations, that are regulated under Part 90 of the FCC's Rules. Generally, WMTS operations are accorded primary status over non-medical telemetry operations in the 1427-1429.5 MHz band, but are treated as secondary to non-medical telemetry operations in the 1429.5-1432 MHz band. However, there are seven geographical areas in which WMTS and non-medical telemetry operations have "flipped" the bands in which each enjoys primary status. These seven areas, termed the "carve-out" areas, are (1) Pittsburgh, PA; (2) the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area; (3) Richmond/Norfolk, VA; (4) Austin/Georgetown, TX; (5) Battle Creek, MI; (6) Detroit, MI; and (7) Spokane, WA. In these seven areas, in contrast to the rest of the country, WMTS has primary status in the 1429-1431.5 MHz band, but is secondary to non-medical telemetry operations in the 1427-1429 MHz band. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== FDA comments ==
Comments from US FDA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationSafety/ElectromagneticCompatibilityEMC/ucm116574.htm|title=About Wireless Medical Telemetry|work=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because of concerns for interference with the present wireless medical telemetry systems, and the introduction of the WMTS, [[CDRH]] has issued a public health advisory to hospital administrators, risk managers, directors of biomedical/clinical engineering, and nursing home directors. In general, CDRH encourages manufacturers and users of medical telemetry devices to move to the new spectrum because of its protections against interference from other intentional transmitters and because frequency coordination will be provided.
