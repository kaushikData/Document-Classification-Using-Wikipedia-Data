'''Adelbert Ames''' (October 31, 1835 &amp;ndash; April 13, 1933) was an American [[sailor]], [[soldier]], and [[politician]] who served with distinction as a [[Union Army]] [[general]] during the [[American Civil War]]. A [[Radical Republican]], he was military governor, [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], and civilian governor in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction-era]] [[History of Mississippi|Mississippi]]. In 1898, he served as a [[United States Army]] general during the [[Spanish–American War]]. He was the last Republican to serve as the state governor of Mississippi until the election of [[Kirk Fordice]], who took office in January 1992, 116 years since Ames vacated the office.

Ames was the second to last [[general officer]] of the Civil War to die. He succumbed at the age of ninety-seven in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, p. 6, "This last survivor of the full-rank general officers on either side of the conflict ..."; Eicher, p. 103, "... the last surviving substantive Civil War general officer."&lt;/ref&gt; He was outlived in this respect only by [[Aaron Daggett]], who died in 1938 at the age of one hundred. However, because Daggett was a brigadier general by brevet rank only, Ames was the last full-ranked Civil War general to die.

==Early life and career==
[[File:A Ames West Point cadet.jpg|thumb|upright|Ames as a West Point cadet]]
Adelbert ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|b|ər|t}} {{Respell|ə|DEL|bərt}})&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Ames was born in 1835 in the town of [[Rockland, Maine|Rockland]] (then known as East [[Thomaston, Maine|Thomaston]]), located in [[Knox County, Maine|Knox County]], [[Maine]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopedia of World Biography |last= |first= |publisher=Gale |year=1998 |isbn= |location=Detroit |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the younger of two sons of Jesse Ames, a sea captain&lt;ref name="The Bloody Shirt"&gt;Budiansky, pp. 64, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; who would later purchase what became the Ames Mill (renowned as the producers of [[MOM Brands|Malt-O-Meal]]) in [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]], [[Minnesota]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northfieldhistorical.org/items/show/20 The Ames Mill | NorthfieldHistorical]&lt;/ref&gt; and Martha Bradbury Ames. Adelbert Ames also grew up to be a sailor and became a mate on a [[clipper]] [[sailing ship|ship]],&lt;ref name=Warner5&gt;Warner, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and he also served briefly as a merchant seaman on his father's ship.

On July 1, 1856, he entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], [[New York (U.S. state)|New York]]; he graduated five years later, fifth in his class of forty-five.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civilwarintheeast.com/west-point-officers-in-the-civil-war/class-of-may-1861/ West Point Officers in the Civil War – Class of May 1861] ''Civil War in the East.'' Web. Retrieved March 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Two classes had graduated that year because of oncoming Civil War. Ames' class had graduated about a month earlier than usual while a second class, set to graduate in 1862, instead graduated on June 24, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Crafton, Luke. [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/eugene_201101A34.html  The West Point Class of 1861] January 23, 2012. Web. Retrieved March 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
Ames was then commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in the 2nd U.S. Artillery. Eight days later he was promoted to [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] and was assigned to the 5th U.S. Artillery.&lt;ref name=Eicher102&gt;Eicher, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of First Bull Run]] that July, Ames was seriously wounded in the right thigh but refused to leave his guns.&lt;ref name=Bud65&gt;Budiansky, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Brevet (military)|brevetted]] to the rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] on July 21 for his actions at [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1893, Ames received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his performance there.&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 102; Warner, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to duty the following spring, Ames was part of the defenses of [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name=Warner6&gt;Warner, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He then fought in the [[Peninsular Campaign]], and saw action at the [[Battle of Yorktown (1862)|Battle of Yorktown]] from April 5 to May 4, the [[Battle of Gaines' Mill]] on June 27, and the [[Battle of Malvern Hill]] that July. Ames was commended for his conduct at Malvern Hill by [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Henry J. Hunt]], chief of the artillery of the [[Army of the Potomac]], and he received a brevet promotion to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] on July 1.&lt;ref name=Eicher102 /&gt;

Although Ames was becoming an excellent artillery officer, he realized that significant promotions would be available only in the infantry. He returned to Maine and politicked to receive a commission as a regimental commander of infantry and was assigned to command the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] on August 20, 1862.&lt;ref name=Eicher102 /&gt; The 20th Maine fought in the [[Maryland Campaign]], but saw little action at the [[Battle of Antietam]] on September 17, while in a reserve capacity. During the Union defeat at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] that winter, Ames led his regiment in one of the last charges on December 13 against Marye's Heights. During the Chancellorsville Campaign in May 1863, Ames volunteered as an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George G. Meade]], commander of the [[V Corps (Union Army)|V Corps]].

Probably as a result of this staff duty and his proximity to the influential Meade,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Ames was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the Union Army on May 20, 1863, two weeks following the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]].&lt;ref name=Eicher102 /&gt; Ames assumed brigade command in the [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]] of the Army of the Potomac, relinquishing his command of the 20th Maine to Lt. Col. [[Joshua L. Chamberlain]], who would soon lead the regiment to fame in the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] that July.

[[File:A Ames and staff UA ACW.JPG|thumb|right|Ames (seated, center) and his staff during the American Civil War]]
While his own experience at Gettysburg did not achieve the renown of Chamberlain's, Ames performed well under difficult circumstances. During the massive assault by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Richard S. Ewell]] on July 1, 1863, Ames's division commander, Brig. Gen. [[Francis C. Barlow]], moved his division well in front of other elements of the XI Corps to a slight rise that is now known as Barlow's Knoll. This salient position was quickly overrun, and Barlow was wounded and captured. Ames took command of the division and led it in retreat through the streets of Gettysburg to a position on [[Cemetery Hill]]. On July 2, the second day of battle, Ames's battered division bore the brunt of the assault on East Cemetery Hill by [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal A. Early]], but was able to hold the critical position with help from surrounding units. At one point Ames himself took part in the hand-to-hand fighting. After the battle, the men of the 20th Maine presented Ames with their battle flag as a token of their esteem.

[[File:Adelbert Ames.jpg|thumb|upright|Ames as a major general in the Union Army]]
After the battle, Ames reverted to brigade command with a brevet promotion to colonel in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]]. His division, under the command of Brig. Gen. [[George Henry Gordon|George H. Gordon]], was transferred to the Department of the South, where it served in actions in [[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina]] and [[Florida in the American Civil War|Florida]].

In 1864, Ames's division, now part of the [[X Corps (Union Army)|X Corps]] of the [[Army of the James]], served under Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]] in the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign]] and the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. In the future, he would become Butler's son-in-law. That winter, the division was reassigned to the [[XXIV Corps (Union Army)|XXIV Corps]] and sent to [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]].

During the two years following his service in the Army of the Potomac, Ames shifted between brigade and division command (and even led his corps on two occasions), though he generally can be identified as a division commander. He led the successful assault in the [[Second Battle of Fort Fisher]] (commanding the 2nd Division, XXIV Corps), accompanying his men into the formidable coastal fortress as most of his staff were shot down by Confederate snipers.&lt;ref name=Bud65 /&gt; He received a brevet promotion to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in the Union Army (and brigadier general in the Regular Army) on March 13, 1865, for his role in the battle.&lt;ref name=Eicher103&gt;Eicher, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mississippian politics and the U.S. Senate==
In 1868, Ames was appointed by Congress to be provisional governor of Mississippi. His command soon extended to the [[Fourth Military District]], which consisted of Mississippi and [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref name=BDUSC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=A000172 |title=Ames, Adelbert |accessdate=2009-04-11 |work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress |publisher=[[United States Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his administration, he took several steps to advance the rights of freed slaves, appointing the first black office-holders in state history. White supremacist terrorism and violence was prevalent in the state, one of the last to comply with [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], but a general election was held during his tenure in 1869 and the legislature convened at the beginning of the following year.&lt;ref name="The Bloody Shirt" /&gt;

About 1868, Ames became an original companion of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]], a military society of former Union officers and their descendants.

The [[Mississippi Legislature]] elected Ames to the U.S. Senate after the readmission of Mississippi to the Union; he served from February 24, 1870, to January 10, 1874, as a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]].&lt;ref name="The Bloody Shirt" /&gt;&lt;ref name=BDUSC /&gt; In [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Ames met and married on July 21, 1870, [[Blanche Butler Ames|Blanche Butler]], daughter of his former commander, then  [[U.S. Representative]] [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], later a one-term [[governor of Massachusetts]]. The couple had six children including [[Adelbert Ames, Jr.]], and [[Butler Ames]].&lt;ref name="The Bloody Shirt" /&gt; As a senator, Ames became a talented public speaker to the point where even some of his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponents acknowledged his ability.&lt;ref name="The Bloody Shirt" /&gt;

In the Senate, Ames was chairman of the Senate Committee on Enrolled Bills.&lt;ref name=BDUSC /&gt; Upon being elected governor of Mississippi, he resigned his seat to assume his duties.&lt;ref name="The Bloody Shirt" /&gt;

Ames battled [[James Lusk Alcorn]] — a former Confederate general who became a [[Scalawag]] — for control of the Republican Party, which was then composed mostly of black voters. Their struggle ripped apart the party. In 1873 they both sought a decision by running for governor. Ames was supported by the Radicals and most [[African American]]s, while Alcorn won the votes of [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] whites and most of the scalawags. Ames won by a vote of 69,870 to 50,490.

As governor, Ames fought to cut spending and lower the tax rate, with moderate success. The state rate of 14 1/2 mills in 1874 was reduced to 9 1/2 in 1875 and 6 1/2 in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;''Cincinnati Daily Gazette'', September 16, 1875&lt;/ref&gt;

Even his enemies agreed that the governor had a rigorous integrity, incorruptible and sincere.&lt;ref&gt;Lemann, ''Redemption'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt; His appointments included some Scalawags and a few former Confederates; but he was never happy in Mississippi, and much of the time his wife and family remained in the North, where the weather was cooler and the social atmosphere less unpleasant. Ames was proud of his record, and, to his own thinking considered himself one of the best Republican governors of any of the Reconstructed states — an opinion generally shared by historians since that time.&lt;ref&gt;Ames,''Adelbert Ames'', 387–89.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he had little success in winning over his enemies in the party and was quick to impute sinister motives on their part.

His real problems came from the Democratic efforts to undo Reconstruction and gain control. Democrats in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] launched a coup in December 1874; when the sheriff called on his supporters to restore him to office, there was a battle that ended in a massacre of black Republicans. Ames had no forces to send, and depended on the national government for troops to reinstate the ousted officials.&lt;ref&gt;Lemann, ''Redemption'', 75-92.&lt;/ref&gt; In the months that followed, he failed to mobilize a state militia to cope with renewed troubles. By that August, the Democratic Party had united to carry the legislative elections that fall, and carried out what came to be called the "[[Mississippi Plan]]." A riot in Yazoo county drove out the Republican sheriff and resulted in some black people and party officers being lynched. Another at [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]] on September 4 ended with white Democratic paramilitaries riding over the county shooting any and every black person they chanced upon. With no other means of protection, Governor Ames appealed to the federal government for assistance. It was not refused, but authorities urged him to exhaust state resources first.&lt;ref&gt;Lemann, ''Redemption'', 120–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to organize a state militia in time, Ames signed a peace treaty with Democratic leaders. In return for disarming the few militia units he had assembled, they promised to guarantee a full, free, fair election. These promises were not kept.&lt;ref&gt;Lemann, ''Redemption'', 128–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

That November, Democrats terrorized a large part of the Republican vote to keep it home, drove voters from the polls with shotguns and cannon, and gained firm control of both houses of the legislature. The state legislature, convening in 1876, drew up articles of impeachment against him; with a five to one majority and deeply hostile feelings towards Ames, their investigations "failed to trace a dollar of unearned money to his pockets," one reporter noted. "Whatever Ames may be, he is not dishonest."&lt;ref&gt;''Cincinnati Commercial'', November 4, 1875, March 30, 1876;&lt;/ref&gt; Though insiders agreed that their case was a very weak one, removal was certain—particularly after his black lieutenant-governor had been removed and the line of succession led to a Democrat. Rather than face a trial that would entail great expense, Ames's lawyers made a deal: once the legislature had dropped all charges, he would resign his office. It did so, and he did so on the evening of March 29, 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Ellem (1992); ''New York Times'', March 30, 1876'&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving office, Ames settled briefly in Northfield, Minnesota, where he joined his father and brother in their flour-milling business. During his residence there, in September 1876, [[Jesse James (outlaw)|Jesse James]] and his gang of former Confederate guerrillas raided the town's bank, largely because of Ames's (and controversial Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler's]]) investment in it, but their attempt to rob it ended in catastrophic failure. Ames next headed to [[New York City]], then later settled in [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extras.lowellsun.com/gettysburg/ |title=Our Gettysburg Hero |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an executive in a flour mill, along with other business interests in the nearby city of [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]].&lt;ref name=BDUSC /&gt;

In 1898, he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers in the [[Spanish–American War]] and fought in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name=BDUSC /&gt; During the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Division suffered particularly high casualties with its brigade commander killed and the next two ranking regimental commanders wounded. General Ames was assigned to command the brigade during the [[Siege of Santiago]]. He was in command of the 1st Division at the time the V Corps was mustered out in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/America/United_States/Army/USMA/Cullums_Register/1892*.html |title=Adelbert Ames • Cullum's Register • 1892 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years afterward, he retired from business pursuits in Lowell but continued in [[real estate]] and entertainment projects in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], and [[Florida]]. Ames corresponded extensively with the historian [[James Wilford Garner]] during this period; Garner's dissertation viewed Reconstruction as "unwise," but absolved Ames of personal corruption.&lt;ref name=Lemann&gt;Lemann, np.&lt;/ref&gt; Ames's widow compiled a collection of her correspondence with Ames, ''Chronicles from the Nineteenth Century'', published posthumously in 1957.

About 1900, Ames joined the Massachusetts [[General Society of Colonial Wars|Society of Colonial Wars]].

Ames died in 1933 at the age of 97, at his winter home in [[Ormond Beach, Florida|Ormond Beach]], Florida. At the time of his death, Ames was the last surviving full-rank general who had served in the Civil War. (The last Union general officer, Aaron S. Daggett, lived five years longer than Ames, but he had been a brevet brigadier general of [[United States Volunteers|U.S. Volunteers]] in March 1865, while Ames had been promoted to the permanent rank of brigadier general in the [[Regular Army (United States)#Civil War|Regular Army]] about the same period.)

Ames is buried in the Hildreth family cemetery — the family of his mother-in-law, Sarah Hildreth Butler — behind the main cemetery (also known as [[Hildreth Cemetery]]) on Hildreth Street in Lowell, Massachusetts. Buried with him are his wife Blanche Butler Ames, their six children, and the spouses of his son Butler and his daughter Edith.

==Notable descendants==
His daughter [[Blanche Ames Ames]] (she married into another Ames family) was a noted [[suffragist]], inventor, artist, and writer. The mansion she designed and had built is now part of [[Borderland State Park]] in Massachusetts.

His son [[Adelbert Ames, Jr.]] was a noted scientist.

His son [[Butler Ames]] was a businessman and politician, who represented Massachusetts in Congress for ten years.

Adelbert Ames was also the great-grandfather of [[George Plimpton]].  [[John F. Kennedy]], through George Plimpton, is indirectly responsible for a full-length biography of General Ames. In ''[[Profiles in Courage]]'', Kennedy relied on [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era historical texts to produce a brief but misleading, false, and devastating portrait of Ames's administration of Mississippi in his profile of Mississippi Senator [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)|Lucius Q.C. Lamar]]. Ames's daughter Blanche Ames Ames, a formidable figure in Massachusetts, bombarded the then-senator with letters complaining about the depiction, and continued her barrage after Kennedy entered the [[White House]]. President Kennedy then turned to his friend Plimpton to tell Blanche, Plimpton's grandmother, that she was "interfering with state business." Her response was to write her own book about her father, ''Adelbert Ames'', in 1964.

==In memoriam==
[[File:General Ames' Medal of Honor Plaque.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Medal of Honor]] plaque at Ames' grave at the Hildreth family cemetery in Lowell, Massachusetts]]
A [[Medal of Honor]] plaque for Ames's gravesite was dedicated at a ceremony honoring Benjamin Butler's 191st birthday, held at the Hildreth family cemetery—the only time of the year it is open to the public—on November 1, 2009.

The United Spanish War Veterans established Camp 19, General Adelbert Ames Post, in Lowell, Massachusetts.

===Ames Hill Castle===
After settling in Massachusetts, Ames built a seventeen-room estate in Tewksbury known locally as "the Castle" on Prospect Hill, now called Ames Hill, in 1906. In 1986, the Ames Hill Castle was purchased by local developer John D. Sullivan; Sullivan then illegally converted the house into a multi-unit rental property. However, Sullivan has been subject to several court rulings for zoning violations on the property, including one in 1991 and again in 1999. In August 2010, Sullivan's attorney brought forth a proposal to Tewksbury's [[board of selectmen]] for modifications to the Ames Hill Castle, to fall under the [[Massachusetts Comprehensive Permit Act: Chapter 40B]], which would allow him to legally maintain the property as a multi-unit rental. The board elected unanimously to table the proposal, citing several concerns – both with Sullivan's absence (as he had sent his attorney rather than present the proposal in person) and reluctance to meet with local residents, and his prior legal issues with the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homenewshere.com/tewksbury_town_crier/article_7572db27-d10e-594a-8d48-2df756a30f7c.html |title=40B for Ames Hill Castle? |work=Homenewshere.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the Ames Hill Castle was unanimously voted "preferably preserved" by the Tewksbury Historic Commission due to its unique architectural features, its current state of preservation, and its association with General Ames. This allowed the commission to invoke a nine-month delay in possible demolition of the property to pursue alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lowellsun.com/local/ci_20212668/ames-hill-castle-wins-9-month-reprieve |title=Ames Hill Castle wins 9-month reprieve |date=20 March 2012 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, local developer Marc Ginsburg purchased the Castle and surrounding plot from Sullivan for $360,000, just as the delay expired. Ginsburg ultimately decided on the Castle's demolition, to make way for smaller single-family dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lowellsun.com/ci_22175327/bulldozers-storm-ames-castle |title=Bulldozers storm Ames Castle |date=12 December 2012 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Empty section|date=June 2018}}

==  Unsuccessful attempt to lynch Aleksei by Mexicans ==
Aleksei Makeev is known for his disdainful attitude towards other people. He believes that those around him are just looking for ways to “how to piss him off”. In [[Mexico]], however, his suspicions were reinforced by his belonging to [[Russia]]. Thus, his Mexican video blog has acquired a racist character: in most of his videos one can hear discriminatory remarks about the people of Mexico because of his suspicions of discrimination of his personality.

Mexicans didn't accept this attitude to themselves, so they decided to hold a blogger over [[lynching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://360tv.ru/news/tekst/kto-takoj-aleksej-makeev-i-pochemu-meksikancy-zahoteli-ego-ubit-112124/|title=Кто такой Алексей Макеев и почему мексиканцы захотели его убить|last=|first=|date=|work=Телеканал 360°|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.5-tv.ru/news/128947/|title=Скандально известного видеоблогера-дауншифтера Алексея Макеева, возможно, жестоко избили в Мексике|last=|first=|date=|work=Пятый канал|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://russian.rt.com/world/article/391646-kankun-rossiyanin-izbieniye-povedeniye|title=Мексиканская вендетта: в Канкуне россиянина избили из-за неадекватного поведения|last=|first=|date=|work=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=|first=|date=|year=|origyear=|title=Кто такой Алексей Макеев, которого в Мексике побила толпа местных жителей?|url=http://www.aif.ru/dontknows/actual/kto_takoy_aleksey_makeev_kotorogo_v_meksike_pobila_tolpa_mestnyh_zhiteley|format=|journal=Аргументы и факты|type=|series=|language=ru-RU|edition=|location=|publisher=|volume=|issue=|page=|pages=|at=|arxiv=|bibcode=|doi=|isbn=|issn=|pmid=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|quote=|ref=|via=|editor=|agency=|number=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inosmi.ru/social/20170522/239406520.html|title=Мексиканская толпа линчевала русского "нациста" в Канкуне|last=|first=|date=2017-05-22|work=ИноСМИ.ру|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ren.tv/novosti/2017-05-21/mat-rossiyskogo-blogera-nacista-izbitogo-do-polusmerti-v-meksike-dur-v-internete|title=Мать российского блогера-нациста, избитого до полусмерти в Мексике: Дурь в интернете - вот и все его преступление|last=|first=|date=2017-05-21|work=РЕН ТВ|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, on '''May 20, 2017''' a large number of people gathered near the house where Alextime rented his apartment. For some time the crowd didn't attempt to break through, confining itself to verbal skirmishes and throwing stones at the windows. The police also came to the scene, but later they left. The point of boiling was the moment when one of the Mexicans climbed onto the [[terrace (building)|terrace]] and tried to provoke the blogger, and he in turn, for self-defense, caused several knife strikes, in connection with which the man died on the spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ren.tv/novosti/2017-05-21/ubiystvo-meksikanca-rossiyskim-blogerom-zapechatleno-na-video-18|title=Убийство мексиканца российским блогером запечатлено на видео (18+)|last=|first=|date=2017-05-21|work=РЕН ТВ|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the crowd burst into Makeev's house and began brutally beating him. Later, the police arrived at the scene, stopping the mob law over Makeev, in connection with which he survived. Aleksei received a [[Traumatic brain injury|craniocerebral injury]] and was paralyzed, the doctors brought him into a state of [[artificial coma]].

After the incident, Makeev was prosecuted for his injuries, which led to the death of a nineteen-year-old Mexican. At the moment, an investigation is underway, Makeev is in the detention center of [[Cancún]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lenta.ru/news/2017/06/03/odinochka/|title=Россиянин Макеев помещен в одиночную камеру в мексиканской тюрьме|last=|first=|date=|work=[[Lenta.ru]]|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ren.tv/novosti/2017-05-30/rossiyaninu-makeevu-predyavili-obvinenie-v-ubiystve-v-meksike|title=Россиянину Макееву предъявили обвинение в убийстве в Мексике|last=|first=|date=2017-05-30|work=РЕН ТВ|access-date=2018-05-02|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American City Business Journals''' '''(ACBJ)''' is an American newspaper chain based in [[Charlotte]], owned by [[Advance Publications]]. ACBJ owns a range of media outlets, including 40 primary metropolitan weekly publications, which reach 4 million readers with business community related news, and [[The Business Journals]], which has daily news from those newspapers and other business news and information. It also controls the [[Street &amp; Smith's]] Sports Group, which publishes periodicals, including ''Sports Business Journal'' and ''Sports Business Daily''.

American City also publishes specialty publications, which include a high-tech business newspaper, a law journal, and [[Hemmings Motor News]]. In 2009, ACBJ took over management of Portfolio.com, a website formerly associated with the now-defunct, ''[[Condé Nast Portfolio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkingbiznews.com/?p=12277 "More on the Portfolio.com relaunch"], ''Talking Biz News'', December 8, 2009 8:15&amp;nbsp;am.

Mike Russell founded American City Business Journals. The President and CEO of American City is Whitney Shaw. Shaw was previously senior vice president of ACBJ and president of its sports-publishing division. He succeeds his father, Ray Shaw, who was chairman and CEO of ACBJ for 25 years{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. [[Ray Shaw (journalist)|Ray Shaw]], the company's chairman from 1989 until his 2009 death, bought a controlling interest along with a partner in 1989, selling to Advance Publications in 1995.

Under Ray Shaw's leadership, the company moved from [[Kansas City, Missouri]], to Charlotte and greatly increased the number of its publications.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite news|url=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8047">A '''bridge bank''' is an institution created by a [[financial regulator|national regulator]] or [[central bank]] to operate a [[bank failure|failed bank]] until a buyer can be found for its operations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Fitch, ''Barron's Dictionary of Banking Terms'' ([[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]], 2006: {{ISBN|0-8120-9659-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], [http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/matrix/exhibit2.html Delegations of Authority: Enforcement Actions], accessed July 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

While national laws vary, the bridge bank is usually established by a publicly backed [[deposit insurance]] organisation or [[financial regulator]] and may be instituted to avoid [[systemic risk]] and provide an orderly transition avoiding negative effects such as [[bank run]]s.

Typically, the tasks of a bridge bank are to ensure seamless continuity of banking operations by:
* Assuming the deposits of and honouring the commitments of the failed bank, so that service to retail clients is not disrupted
* Servicing adequately secured existing loans to avoid their premature interruption or termination
* Assuming other existing assets, liabilities or functions of the defunct bank at the discretion of the regulator

These tasks are carried out on a temporary basis (usually for no more than two or three years) to provide time to find a buyer for the bank as a going concern. If the bank cannot be sold as a going concern, its portfolio of assets are liquidated in an orderly fashion. Should the bridge bank fail to wind down its operations within the allotted time, the national deposit insurance corporation is appointed as the receiver of the bridge bank's assets.

==Operation by country==

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria the ([[Central Bank of Nigeria]] (CBN) and the [[Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (NDIC) administer the deposits and liabilities of a failed bank. Under the arrangement, the  NDIC is authorized to operate a failed bank for a period until a buyer can be found for its operations.

When in the opinion of CBN, a NDIC-insured bank is in financial trouble, the CBN and NDIC may establish a bridge bank to;

* Assume the deposits of the closed bank;
* Assume such other liabilities of the closed bank as the Deposit Insurance Corporation may determine to be appropriate;
* Purchase such [[asset]]s of the closed bank as the Deposit Insurance Corporation may determine to be appropriate; and
* Perform any other temporary function which the Deposit Insurance Corporation may prescribe in accordance with this Act.

Bridge banks are authorized to seek to liquidate failed banks, either by finding buyers for the bank as a [[going concern]], or by liquidating its portfolio of assets, within two years, which can be extended by an additional year.  Should the bridge bank fail to wind down its operations within the allotted time, the bridge bank must notify the Governor of the CBN of its intent to dissolve the bridge bank. Under this situation, the NDIC is appointed as the [[Receivership|receiver]] of the bridge bank's assets.

====Historic example====
On August 5, 2011, Central Bank of Nigeria revoked the operating licenses of three banks including; [[Afribank]], [[Spring Bank]], and [[Bank PHB]], which according to it, did not show enough capacity and ability for [[recapitalization]].

In their place, the CBN through the NDIC established Bridge Banks and transferred the assets and liabilities of the three affected banks to the Bridge Banks as follows;

# [[Mainstreet Bank Limited]] (Afribank),
# [[Keystone Bank Limited]] (Bank PHB), and
# [[Enterprise Bank Limited]] (Spring Bank).

Under the arrangement, MainStreet Bank Limited took over the assets and liabilities of Afribank; Keystone Bank Limited assumed the assets and liabilities of Bank PHB, while Enterprise Bank Limited took over that of Spring Bank.

The Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) immediately acquired from the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), the three Bridge Banks. Accordingly, AMCON injected N679 billion into the Bridge Banks to meet the minimum capital base of N25 billion and the minimum [[capital adequacy ratio]] of 15 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/08/afribank-co-amcon-acquires-bridge-banks-injects-n679bn/ |title=Afribank &amp; Co: AMCON acquires Bridge Banks, injects N679bn |date=August 7, 2011 |publisher=Vanguard }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/01/bridge-banks-amcon-transfers-ownership-skye-heritage-banks/ |title=Bridge banks: AMCON transfers ownership to Skye, Heritage Banks |date=January 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States law]] of [[banking regulation]], a bridge bank is organized by federal bank regulators to administer the [[bank deposit|deposits]] and liabilities of a [[bank failure|failed bank]].&lt;ref&gt;CEBA, [http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt HR. 27 (1987)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028114326/http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt |date=October 28, 2014 }}, ss. 503.  Codified at 12 [[United States Code|USC]] ch. 16, ss. 1821(n).&lt;/ref&gt;Under the ''Competitive Equality Banking Act'' (CEBA) of 1987, the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) is authorized to operate a failed bank for a period of up to three years, until a buyer can be found for its operations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Fitch, ''Barron's Dictionary of Banking Terms'' ([[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]], 2006: {{ISBN|0-8120-9659-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], [http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/matrix/exhibit2.html Delegations of Authority: Enforcement Actions], accessed July 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under CEBA, when a FDIC-insured bank is in financial trouble, the FDIC "may establish a bridge bank to &amp;mdash;
# assume the deposits of the closed bank;
# assume such other liabilities of the closed bank as the Corporation, in the Corporation's discretion, may determine to be  appropriate;
# purchase such assets of the closed bank as the Corporation, in the Corporation's discretion, may determine to be appropriate; and
# perform any other temporary function which the Corporation may prescribe in accordance with this Act."&lt;ref&gt;CEBA, [http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt HR. 27 (1987)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028114326/http://www.philadelphiafed.org/src/ceba87.txt |date=October 28, 2014 }}, ss. 503.  Codified at 12 [[United States Code|USC]] ch. 16, ss. 1821(n).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridge banks must be chartered as [[national bank]]s in accordance with [[US banking law]]. To the extent possible, bridge banks are required to honor the commitments of the failed bank to its customers, and not to interrupt or terminate adequately [[Collateral (finance)|secured]] [[loan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;12 USC ch. 16, ss. 1821(n)(3)(B)&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridge banks are authorized to seek to liquidate failed banks, either by finding buyers for the bank as a going concern, or by liquidating its [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of assets, within two years, which can be extended for cause by an additional year. Should the bridge bank fail to wind down its operations within the allotted time, the bridge bank must notify the [[Comptroller of the Currency]] of its intent to [[dissolution (law)|dissolve]] the bridge bank. Under this situation, the FDIC is appointed as the [[receiver (legal)|receiver]] of the bridge bank's assets.&lt;ref&gt;12 USC ch. 16, ss. 1821(n)(12)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Byron Sharp''' is Professor of [[Marketing]] Science at the [[University of South Australia]], known for his work on [[loyalty program]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Richard L. "Whence consumer loyalty?." ''the Journal of Marketing'' (1999): 33-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wulf, Kristof De, Gaby Odekerken-Schröder, and Dawn Iacobucci. "Investments in consumer relationships: a cross-country and cross-industry exploration." ''Journal of marketing'' 65.4 (2001): 33-50.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Life and work ==
Born in [[New Zealand]], Sharp obtained his Bachelor of Commerce in Marketing in 1988 at the [[University of Auckland]], and his Master of Business by Research at the [[University of South Australia]], and PhD from the University of Adelaide.&lt;ref name="BS 2015"&gt;"Byron Sharp: Professor of Marketing Science, Director Ehrenberg-Bass Institute," at linkedin.com, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1995 Sharp was appointed Director of the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute at the University of South Australia, and in 1999 Professor of [[Marketing]].&lt;ref name="BS 2015"/&gt; He also serves as board member at the Wharton SEI Center's Future of Advertising project.

His research interests include buyer behaviour and brand performance, laws &amp; principles in marketing, market-based assets, and advertising &amp; Media

== Work==
In 1997, with Anne Sharp, he reported the first empirical work seeking to document the effect of a loyalty program on buyer loyalty&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Byron and Anne Sharp (1997), "Loyalty Programs and Their Impact on Repeat-Purchase Loyalty Patterns," ''International Journal of Research in Marketing'', 14 (5), 473-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The research found a tendency across the product categories studied for [[loyalty programs]] to produce a small amount of excess loyalty.  This weak effect was later replicated.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Byron and Anne Sharp (1999), "Loyalty Programs and Their Impact on Repeat-Purchase Loyalty Patterns:  A Replication and Extension," in 28th ''European Marketing Academy Conference Proceedings,'' Berlin, Germany: Institute of Marketing II, Humboldt-University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer-Waarden, Lars (2002) "The sources of Efficiency in Loyalty Programs-An Empirical Investigation based upon a Single Source Panel", PhD thesis, University of Pau, France.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jorna Leenheer, Harald J. van Heerde, Tammo H.A. Bijmolt and [[Ale Smidts]] (2007) "Do loyalty programs really enhance behavioral loyalty? An empirical analysis accounting for self-selecting members", ''International Journal of Research in Marketing'', 24,1, p.31-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 he co-edited a special issue of the ''Journal of Advertising Research'' with [[Jerry (Yoram) Wind|Professor Jerry Wind]] on empirical laws in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Yoram (Jerry Wind and Byron Sharp (2009) "What We Know About Advertising", ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' 49,2&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2171">The '''chief compliance officer''' ('''CCO''') of a company is the officer primarily responsible for overseeing and managing [[regulatory compliance]] issues within an organization. The CCO typically reports to the [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Office]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r or [[Chief operating officer|Chief Operations Officer]]. 

The role has long existed at companies that operate in heavily regulated industries such as [[financial services]] and [[healthcare]]. For other companies, the rash of 2000s [[accounting scandals]], the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], and the recommendations of the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines have led to additional CCO appointments. 

Scott Cohen, editor and publisher of ''[[Compliance Week]]'', dates the proliferation of CCOs to a 2002 speech by SEC commissioner [[Cynthia Glassman]], in which she called on companies to designate a "corporate responsibility officer."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/spch586.htm SEC Commissioner's Speech: Sarbanes-Oxley and the Idea of "Good" Governance (Cynthia A. Glassman)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibilities of the position often include leading enterprise compliance efforts, designing and implementing internal controls, policies and procedures to assure compliance with applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations and third party guidelines; managing audits and investigations into regulatory and compliance issues; and responding to requests for information from regulatory bodies.

'''Corder Drum Company''' was a [[percussion instrument]] manufacturing company based in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. The company was created in 1979 by Jim Corder, following his purchase of the dies, moulds and tooling apparatus of the [[Fibes Drums|Fibes Drum]] Company from its then-owner, the [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company|C.F. Martin Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, Geoff; Slingsby, Miki; and Bacon, Tony (1997).

'''Downtown Pittsburgh''', colloquially referred to as the '''Golden Triangle''', and officially the '''Central Business District''',&lt;ref name="pgh_snap"/&gt; is the urban downtown center of [[Pittsburgh]]. It is located at the confluence of the [[Allegheny River]] and the [[Monongahela River]] whose joining forms the [[Ohio River]]. The "triangle" is bounded by the two rivers. The area features offices for major corporations such as [[PNC Bank]], [[U.S. Steel]], [[PPG Industries|PPG]], [[Bank of New York Mellon]], [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], [[Federated Investors]] and [[Alcoa]]. It is where the fortunes of such industrial barons as [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Henry Clay Frick]], [[Henry J. Heinz]], [[Andrew Mellon]] and [[George Westinghouse]] were made. It contains the site where the French fort, [[Fort Duquesne]], once stood.

In 2013, Pittsburgh had the second-lowest vacancy rate for Class A space among downtowns in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Belko | first =Mark | title =In The Lead: Low vacancy recorded in Downtown Pittsburgh | newspaper =[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date =May 14, 2014 | url =http://www.post-gazette.com/in-the-lead-2014-stories/2014/05/14/Infrastructure-Low-vacancy-in-Downtown-Pittsburgh/stories/201405150087 | accessdate =May 14, 2014 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140516002255/http://www.post-gazette.com/in-the-lead-2014-stories/2014/05/14/Infrastructure-Low-vacancy-in-Downtown-Pittsburgh/stories/201405150087 | archivedate =May 16, 2014 | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The Central Business District is bounded by the Monongahela River to the south, the Allegheny River to the north, and [[Interstate 579|I-579 (Crosstown Boulevard)]] to the east. An expanded definition of Downtown may include the adjacent neighborhoods of [[Bluff (Pittsburgh)|Uptown/The Bluff]], the [[Strip District]], the [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Shore]], and the [[South Shore (Pittsburgh)|South Shore]].

== Transportation ==
[[File:SmithfieldBridge-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The Smithfield Street Bridge]]
[[File:Muralof300SixthStreetBuilding.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Famous mural on the 300 Sixth Street building]]

=== Public transportation ===
Downtown is served by the [[Port Authority of Allegheny County|Port Authority]]'s [[Pittsburgh Light Rail|light rail]] subway system (known locally as the "T"), an extensive bus network, and two [[funicular|inclines]] ([[Duquesne Incline]] and [[Monongahela Incline]]). The Downtown portion of the subway has the following stations:

''T Stations''
* '''[[Station Square (PAT station)|Station Square]]''' on the South Shore in the [[Station Square]] development (street-level station)
* '''[[First Avenue (PAT station)|First Avenue]]''' near First Avenue &amp; Ross Street, Downtown (elevated station)
* '''[[Steel Plaza (PAT station)|Steel Plaza]]''' at Sixth Avenue &amp; Grant Street, Downtown (underground station)
* '''Penn Plaza''' near Liberty Avenue &amp; Grant Street, Downtown (underground, limited service)
* '''[[Wood Street (PAT station)|Wood Street]]''' at the triangular intersection of Wood Street, Sixth Avenue, and Liberty Avenue, Downtown (underground station)
* '''[[Gateway Center (PAT station)|Gateway Center]]''' at Liberty Avenue &amp; Stanwix Street, Downtown (underground station)
* '''[[North Side (PAT station)|North Side]]''' near General Robinson Street &amp; Tony Dorsett Drive on the North Shore (underground station)
* '''[[Allegheny (PAT station)|Allegheny]]''' near Allegheny Avenue &amp; Reedsdale Street on the North Shore (elevated station)

Downtown is also home to the [[Union Station (Pittsburgh)|Pittsburgh]] [[Amtrak]] train station connecting Pittsburgh with New York City, [[Philadelphia]], and Washington, D.C. to the east and [[Cleveland]] and Chicago to the west. [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]]'s Pittsburgh bus terminal is located across Liberty Avenue from the Amtrak Station, in the Grant Street Transportation Center building.

=== Highways ===
Major roadways serving Downtown from the suburbs include the "Parkway East" ([[Interstate 376|I-376]]) from [[Monroeville, Pennsylvania|Monroeville]], the "Parkway West" ([[Interstate 376|I-376]]) from the [[Pittsburgh International Airport|airport]] area, and the "Parkway North" ([[Interstate 279|I-279]]) from the [[North Hills (Pennsylvania)|North Hills]], and ([[Interstate 579|I-579]]) in Downtown Pittsburgh. Other important roadways are [[Pennsylvania Route 28]], [[Pennsylvania Route 51]], [[Pennsylvania Route 65]], and [[U.S. Route 19]].

Three major entrances to the city are via tunnels: the [[Fort Pitt Tunnel]] and [[Squirrel Hill Tunnel]] on [[Interstate 376|I-376]] and the [[Liberty Tunnels]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' once called Pittsburgh "the only city with an entrance,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pittsburgh.net/about_pittsburgh_topten.cfm | title = Top Ten Reasons to Visit Pittsburgh | accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically referring to the view of Downtown that explodes upon drivers immediately upon exiting the Fort Pitt Tunnel. Also traveling [[Interstate 279|I-279]] south and [[Interstate 376|I-376]], the city "explodes into view" when coming around a turn in the highway.

=== Local streets ===
[[File:Woodstreetpittsburgh1.jpg|thumb|right|Wood Street.]]
Downtown surface streets are based on two distinct grid systems that parallel the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] rivers.&lt;ref name=conti&gt;{{cite news| last = Conti| first = John| title = How a municipality is designed can create elegance or chaos| newspaper = [[Pittsburgh Tribune Review]]| date = January 22, 2012| url = http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/museums/s_777698.html| accessdate = January 22, 2012| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130131075641/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/museums/s_777698.html| archivedate = January 31, 2013| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These two grids intersect along Liberty Avenue, creating many unusual street intersections. Furthermore, the Allegheny grid contains numbered streets, while the Monongahela grid contains numbered avenues.  And, in fact, there are cases where these numbered roadways intersect, creating some confusion (i.e. the intersection of Liberty Avenue and 7th Street/6th Avenue).  This unusual grid pattern leads to Pittsburghers giving directions in the terms of landmarks, rather than turn-by-turn directions.&lt;ref name=conti /&gt;

=== Bridges ===
{{main|Pittsburgh Bridges}}
[[File:Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|At least seventeen of Pittsburgh's bridges are visible in this aerial photo.]]

== Downtown districts ==
Downtown contains a wealth of historic, cultural, and entertainment sites. While most people still consider the entire Downtown as one neighborhood, there are several significant subdistricts within the Golden Triangle.

* The '''[[Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District]]''' is a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] in the central business district. It is bounded by Wood Street, Forbes Avenue, Grant Street, and Liberty Avenue. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) on December 17, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Point State Park]]''' area: At the triangle's tip is [[Point State Park]] with its giant fountain and the [[Fort Pitt Museum]]. This park was the original site of both [[Fort Duquesne]] by the French and the subsequent [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] by the British.
* The '''[[Cultural District, Pittsburgh|Cultural District]]''' along Penn and Liberty avenues on the Allegheny River includes numerous theaters, galleries, and concert halls including [[Heinz Hall]], [[Byham Theater]], [[O'Reilly Theater]], [[Benedum Center]], and [[Wood Street Galleries]] as well as restaurants and housing. The [[Penn-Liberty Historic District]] encompasses the Penn &amp; Liberty avenue corridor in the Cultural District.
* The '''Fifth &amp; Forbes Corridor''' is Downtown's shopping district along Fifth and Forbes avenues and includes historic [[Market Square, Pittsburgh|Market Square]]. Downtown is home to numerous independent retailers plus large retailers such as [[Burlington Coat Factory]] and [[Brooks Brothers]].

* The '''Firstside''' neighborhood along the Boulevard of the Allies and Fort Pitt Boulevard adjacent to the Monongahela River is an educational and residential district. It is home to [[Point Park University]] and the [[Art Institute of Pittsburgh]] both of which have high-rise student housing in the neighborhood. Numerous other residential projects are also under construction in this neighborhood.

== Economy ==
[[File:Jobs located within the City of Pittsburgh, 1991-2007.jpg|thumb|right|Pittsburgh's number of jobs is generally stable.]]
Downtown Pittsburgh retains substantial economic influence, ranking at 25th in the nation for jobs within the urban core and 6th in job density.&lt;ref name="jobsrank"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08216/901307-432.stm | title = Regional Insights: Pittsburgh is a national player in jobs per square mile but needs more population | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date = August 3, 2008 | accessdate = August 6, 2008 | last = Miller | first = Harold | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080817001705/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08216/901307-432.stm | archivedate = August 17, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Pittsburgh]] economist Christopher Briem notes that the level of employment in the city has remained largely constant for the past 50 years: "[the] time series of jobs located in the City proper are about as stable as any economic metric in the region, or in any other Northeastern US urban core, over many decades. In 1958, [there were] 294,000 jobs located in the city proper&amp;hellip;Those numbers are virtually identical today which tells me there is a certain limit to how many jobs can efficiently be located in what are some relatively (very) constrained areas."&lt;ref name="Briem 2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nullspace2.blogspot.com/2011/08/hold-em-like-they-do-in-texas-plays.html|title=hold em like they do in Texas plays|last=Briem|first=Christopher|date=August 5, 2011|work=Nullspace|accessdate=August 6, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328022404/http://nullspace2.blogspot.com/2011/08/hold-em-like-they-do-in-texas-plays.html|archivedate=March 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2016|reason=Nullspace is a self-published blog and therefore not a reliable source}} These numbers reflect employment in the city as a whole, not just the central business district; but the central business district has the highest density of employment of any Pittsburgh neighborhood.

Pittsburgh has long been a headquarters city, with numerous national and global corporations calling the Golden Triangle home. Currently, Downtown is still home to a large number of [[Fortune 500]] companies (8 in the metro area, 6 of which are in the city in 2009, which ranks Pittsburgh high nationally in Fortune 500 headquarters):

The '''Financial District''' is a [[highrise]] office area of within the central business district of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]'s [[Downtown Vancouver|downtown peninsula]]. Located roughly along [[Burrard Street|Burrard]] and [[Georgia Street|West Georgia Street]]s, the Financial District contains more than 60% of [[Greater Vancouver]]'s office space and is home to headquarter offices of forest products and mining companies. The area contains numerous federal and non-governmental organizations (NGO) offices, Overseas missions and consulates, and headquarter and branch offices of national and international banks and financial services, accounting and law firms, and luxury hotels.

==History==

The city's financial district emerged in the early 1900s when the building boom in the area began. From 1907 to 1913 a number of office buildings were built in the area along West Hastings Street:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Vancouver%27s+financial+district+emerged&amp;meta=&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sun Tower
* Dominion Trust Building
* Vancouver Stock Exchange

The financial district only expanded after the 1970s, with much of the new buildings emerging after the 1980s.

Vancouver's financial district is compact area when compared to other world cities. Most of the skyscrapers in the district are regional offices of the Big Five Canadian-based or International banks and various financial services institutions.

'''Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr.''' (August 17, 1914 – August 17, 1988) was an American lawyer, politician, and businessman. He served as a [[United States Congressman]] from New York from 1949 to 1955, the first chairman of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] from 1965 to 1966, and ran twice for [[Governor of New York]]. Roosevelt was also a son of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and served as an officer in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

==Early life==
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. was born on August 17, 1914, the fifth of six children born to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (1882–1945) and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] (1884–1962).  At the time of his birth, his father was [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt; He was born at his parents' summer home at [[Campobello Island]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada, which is now an [[Roosevelt Campobello International Park|international historical park]].

His siblings were: [[Anna Roosevelt Halsted|Anna Eleanor Roosevelt]] (1906–1975), [[James Roosevelt|James Roosevelt II]] (1907–1991), Franklin Roosevelt (1909), a [[Necronym|brother of the same name]] had died in infancy in November 1909, having lived only several months, [[Elliott Roosevelt]] (1910–1990), and [[John Aspinwall Roosevelt|John Aspinwall Roosevelt II]] (1916–1981).&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

As a young man in 1936, he contracted a [[Strep throat|streptococcal throat infection]] and developed life-threatening complications. His successful treatment with [[Prontosil]], the first commercially available [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] drug, avoided a risky surgical procedure which the [[White House]] medical staff had considered, and the subsequent headlines in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other prominent newspapers heralded the start of the era of [[antibiotics|antibacterial chemotherapy]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771900,00.html Medicine: Prontosil], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', December 28, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
He graduated from [[Groton School]] in 1933, [[Harvard University]] in 1937, and from the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] in June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Jr. (1914–1988)|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=R000425|work=Biographical Directory of Congress|publisher=Office of Art and Archives, Office of the Historian, United States House of Representatives|accessdate=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPoObit"/&gt;

The family thought that FDR Jr. was the one most like his father in appearance and behavior. James said, "Franklin is the one who came closest to being another FDR. He had father's looks, his speaking voice, his smile, his charm, his charisma."&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, 313&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Navy service==
[[File:Elliot Roosevelt and FDR Jr - NARA - 195327.tif|200px|thumb|right|[[Elliot Roosevelt]] and FDR Jr., far right, in Casablanca]]

===World War II===
Roosevelt was commissioned an ensign in the U.S. Navy Reserve on June 11, 1940. He was a junior naval officer in [[World War II]] and was decorated for bravery in the battle of [[Naval Battle of Casablanca|Casablanca]].

At the request of his father, along with brother [[Elliott Roosevelt]], he attended both the Argentia ([[Atlantic Charter]]) summit with Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in August 1941, and the [[Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943. Franklin also met FDR in Africa prior to the [[Tehran Conference]]. Returning from [[Argentia]], he sailed with Churchill and stood with him at parades in newly American-occupied [[Reykjavik, Iceland]], to symbolize American solidarity with England, Scotland, and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 211–12, 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Brother [[James Roosevelt]] summarized "Brud's" naval service: "Franklin served on a destroyer that dodged torpedoes from Iceland to Minsk [sic!]. He became executive officer of the destroyer {{USS|Mayrant|DD-402}}, which was bombed at [[Palermo]] in the Sicilian invasion. The famed war correspondent [[Quentin Reynolds]] went out of his way to write mother how bravely Franklin performed in that bloody ordeal, in which he was awarded the [[Silver Star Medal]] for exposing himself under fire to carry a critically wounded sailor to safety." &lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, as a lieutenant commander, to which he was promoted to on March 1, 1944, Franklin became the commanding officer of his own destroyer escort, [[USS Ulvert M. Moore (DE-442)|USS ''Ulvert M. Moore'' (DE-442)]] on July 18, 1944.  The ''Moore'' served in the Pacific and shot down two Japanese aircraft and sank a Japanese submarine.  The ship was in Tokyo Bay when Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945. James Roosevelt remembered that his brother was known as "Big Moose" to the men who served under him, he did "a tremendous job".

&lt;/center&gt;

==Post-war career==
===Law practice===
Roosevelt served in several New York law offices after the war. He was senior partner in the New York law firm of ''Roosevelt and Frieden'', later known as ''Poletti, Diamond, Frieden &amp; Mackay'',&lt;ref name="PerrinWedding"/&gt; before and after his service in the Congress. He triggered controversy for representing Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] in the U.S., and dropped the account before Trujillo's assassination in 1961.

===Politics===
Roosevelt was also involved in political affairs. He served on the [[President's Committee on Civil Rights]] in 1946 for President [[Harry Truman]]. Along with his brothers, he declared for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1948, alienating much of the Democratic party.

He joined the Empire State Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://interactive.ancestry.com/2204/32596_242286-00444/668791?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.com%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3findiv%3d1%26db%3dSARMemberApps%26rank%3d1%26new%3d1%26MSAV%3d0%26msT%3d1%26gss%3dangs-d%26gsfn%3dfranklin%26gsln%3droosevelt%26dbOnly%3d_F0006399%257c_F0006399_x%26uidh%3dvt7%26pcat%3d39%26fh%3d0%26h%3d668791%26recoff%3d%26ml_rpos%3d1&amp;ssrc=&amp;backlabel=ReturnRecord#?imageId=32596_242286-00446]&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. House of Representatives====
Roosevelt Jr. was elected as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] in a special election in 1949, in which he ran as a candidate of the [[Liberal Party of New York]].  He was re-elected in 1950 and 1952 as a Democrat.  He represented the [[New York's 20th congressional district|20th District of New York]] from May 17, 1949 until January 3, 1955.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

Despite his name and connections, he became unpopular with the Democratic leadership. When brother [[James Roosevelt]] was elected to the House, Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] told him to "not waste our time like your brother did." James wrote that Franklin "had a dreadful record in Congress. He was smart, but not smart enough. He had good ideas and the power of persuasion, but he did not put them to good use. He coasted instead of working at his job, considering it beneath him, while he aimed for higher positions. He may have had the worst attendance record of any member of those days, and it cost him those higher positions."&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, 314&lt;/ref&gt;

====Governor of New York====

He again ran for [[Governor of New York]] on the Liberal Party ticket in [[New York state election, 1966|1966]], but was defeated by the incumbent Republican [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

====Ties to John F. Kennedy====
[[File:FDR Jr.gif|thumb|right|FDR Jr. with his mother and his son, FDR III, 1962]]
At the instigation of [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]], he campaigned for [[John F. Kennedy]] in the crucial 1960 [[West Virginia]] primary,&lt;ref name="WaPoObit"/&gt; falsely accusing Kennedy's opponent, [[Hubert Humphrey]] of having dodged the draft in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Caro|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Caro|title=[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Passage of Power]]|pages=85–86|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|publication-place = New York|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy later named him Under-Secretary of Commerce and chairman of the President's Appalachian Regional Commission. This post (Under-Secretary of Commerce) was given to him when Defense Secretary Robert McNamara vetoed his appointment as Secretary of the Navy. "JFK and Franklin were friends and their families were close. Socially, Franklin spent a lot of time in the White House during JFK's reign. But when Kennedy was killed, Franklin fell from power."&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, 315&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as chairman of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] from May 26, 1965 to May 11, 1966 during the administration of Kennedy's successor, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

===Entrepreneur===
Roosevelt was also a distributor of [[FIAT]] and [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] automobiles in the United States.&lt;ref name="WarburgWedding"/&gt; In 1970, he sold the distributorship, ''Roosevelt Automobile Company''.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt; He was a personal friend of Fiat chairman [[Gianni Agnelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bachrach|first1=Judy|title=La Vita Agnelli|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/05/gianni-agnelli-200305|accessdate=13 August 2016|date=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also ran a small [[cattle]] farm and had an interest in [[Thoroughbred]] racehorses. In 1983 he bred the [[colt (horse)|colt]] Brothers N Law. A winner at age two, the New York-bred ran second in the 1986 [[Empire Classic Handicap|Empire Stakes]] hosted that year by the [[Saratoga Race Course]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&amp;refno=963404&amp;registry=T Brothers N Law pedigree at Equibase] Retrieved August 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="77851">The '''history of [[coal]] mining''' goes back thousands of years. It became important in the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today. Compared to [[wood fuel]]s, coal yields a higher amount of energy per mass and can often be obtained in areas where wood is not readily available. Though it was used historically as a domestic fuel, coal is now used mostly in industry, especially in [[smelting]] and [[alloy]] production as well as [[electricity generation]]. Large-scale [[coal mining]] developed during the [[Industrial Revolution]], and coal provided the main source of [[primary energy]] for industry and transportation in industrial areas from the 18th century to the 1950s. Coal remains an important energy source because of its low cost and abundance compared to other fuels, particularly for electricity generation.&lt;ref name="Freese. 2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Freese|title=Coal: A Human History|url=https://www.amazon.com/Coal-Human-History-Barbara-Freese/dp/0142000981/|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=137|isbn=9780142000984}}(stating that, "[c]oal consumption doubled every decade between 1850 and 1890" and that by turn of the century, "coal was the unrivaled foundation of U.S. Power," providing "71 percent of the nation's energy."&lt;/ref&gt; Coal is also mined today on a large scale by [[open pit]] methods wherever the coal [[stratum|strata]] strike the surface or are relatively shallow. Britain developed the main techniques of underground coal mining from the late 18th century onward, with further progress being driven by 19th century and early 20th century progress.&lt;ref name="Freese. 2004"/&gt; However, oil and gas were increasingly used as alternatives from the 1860s onward.

By the late 20th century, coal was, for the most part, replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by [[petroleum|oil]], [[natural gas]] or electricity produced from oil, gas, [[nuclear power]] or [[renewable energy]] sources. By 2010, coal produced over a fourth of the world's energy, and by 2050 it is expected to produce about a third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

Since 1890, coal mining has also been a political and social issue. Coal miners' labour and [[trade union]]s became powerful in many countries in the 20th century, and often, the miners were leaders of the [[Left-wing politics|Left]] or [[Socialist]] movements (as in Britain, Germany, Poland, Japan, Chile, Canada and the U.S.)&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Eley, ''Forging Democracy: The History of the Left in Europe, 1850-2000'' (2002); Frederic Meyers, ''European Coal Mining Unions: structure and function'' (1961) P. 86; Kazuo and Gordon (1997) p 48; [[Hajo Holborn]], ''History of Modern Germany'' (1959) p. 521; David Frank, ''J.

==Early history==

[[File:Hypocaustum.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[hypocaust]] under the floor of a [[Roman villa]]. The part under the [[exedra]] is covered.]]

Early coal extraction was small-scale, the coal lying either on the surface, or very close to it. Typical methods for extraction included [[drift mining]] and [[bell pit]]s. As well as drift mines, small scale [[shaft mining]] was used. This took the form of a bell pit, the extraction working outward from a central shaft, or a technique called [[room and pillar]] in which 'rooms' of coal were extracted with pillars left to support the roofs. Both of these techniques however left considerable amount of usable coal behind.

Archeological evidence in China indicates surface mining of coal and household usage after approximately 3490 BC.

The earliest reference to the use of coal in [[metalworking]] is found in the geological treatise ''On stones'' (Lap. 16) by the Greek scientist [[Theophrastus]] (c. 371–287 BC):

{{quote|Among the materials that are dug because they are useful, those known as coals are made of earth, and, once set on fire, they burn like [[charcoal]]. They are found in [[Liguria]]... and in [[Elis]] as one approaches [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] by the mountain road; and they are used by those who work in metals.&lt;ref&gt;Mattusch, Carol (2008): "Metalworking and Tools", in: [[John Peter Oleson|Oleson, John Peter]] (ed.): ''The Oxford Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-518731-1}}, pp. 418–38 (432).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest known use of coal in the [[Americas]] was by the [[Aztec]]s who used coal for fuel and [[jet (lignite)|jet]] (a type of [[lignite]]) for ornaments.&lt;ref name="Freese. 2004"/&gt;

In [[Roman Britain]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] were exploiting all major coalfields (save those of [[North Staffordshire|North]] and [[South Staffordshire]]) by the late 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name = "Smith 1997, 322–324"&gt;Smith, A. H. V. (1997): "Provenance of Coals from Roman Sites in England and Wales", ''[[Britannia (journal)|Britannia]]'', Vol. 28, pp. 297–324 (322–4).&lt;/ref&gt; While much of its use remained local, a lively trade developed along the [[North Sea]] coast supplying coal to [[Yorkshire]] and [[London]].&lt;ref name="Smith 1997, 322–324"/&gt; This also extended to the continental [[Rhineland]], where [[bituminous coal]] was already used for the smelting of [[iron ore]].&lt;ref name="Smith 1997, 322–324"/&gt; It was used in hypocausts to heat [[Thermae|public baths]], the baths in military forts, and the villas of wealthy individuals. Excavation has revealed coal stores at many forts along [[Hadrian's Wall]] as well as the remains of a [[smelting]] industry at forts such as [[Longovicium]] nearby.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

After the Romans left Britain, in AD 410, there are few records of coal being used in the country until the end of the 12th century. One that does occur is in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] for the year 852 when a rent including 12 loads of coal is mentioned.&lt;ref name=ASC852&gt;Giles, J. A. (trans) [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle_(Giles) The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle], London, G Bell &amp; Sons 1914.  "At this time Ceolred, abbat of Medeshamstede and the monks let to Wulfred the land of Sempringham, ... and each year [he] should deliver into the minster sixty loads of wood, and twelve of coal and six of faggots, and two tuns full of pure ale, and two beasts fit for slaughter, and six hundred loaves, and ten measures of Welsh ale, and each year a horse, and thirty shillings, and one day's entertainment."&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1183 a smith was given land for his work, and was required to "raise his own coal"&lt;ref name=Yeats1871&gt;{{ Citation | last = Yeats | first = John, LLD | title = The technical history of commerce | date = 1871 | publisher = Cassell, Petter and Galpin | place = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|171–2}}  Shortly after the signing of the [[Magna Carta]], in 1215, coal began to be traded in areas of Scotland and the north-east England, where the [[carboniferous]] strata were exposed on the sea shore, and thus became known as "sea coal". This commodity, however, was not suitable for use in the type of domestic hearths then in use, and was mainly used by artisans for [[Calcium oxide|lime burning]], metal working and smelting. As early as 1228, sea coal from the north-east was being taken to London.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882"&gt;Galloway (1882).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |5}} During the 13th century, the trading of coal increased across Britain and by the end of the century most of the coalfields in England, Scotland and Wales were being worked on a small scale.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |8}} As the use of coal amongst the artisans became more widespread, it became clear that coal smoke was detrimental to health and the increasing pollution in London led to much unrest and agitation. As a result of this, a Royal proclamation was issued in 1306 prohibiting artificers of London from using sea coal in their furnaces and commanding them to return to the traditional fuels of wood and charcoal.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |10}} During the first half of the 14th century coal began to be used for domestic heating in coal producing areas of Britain, as improvements were made in the design of domestic hearths.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |13}} [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] was the first king to take an interest in the coal trade of the north east, issuing a number of writs to regulate the trade and allowing the export of coal to [[Calais]].&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |15}} The demand for coal steadily increased in Britain during the 15th century, but it was still mainly being used in the mining districts, in coastal towns or being exported to continental Europe.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |19}} However, by the middle of the 16th century supplies of wood were beginning to fail in Britain and the use of coal as a domestic fuel rapidly expanded.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |22}}

In 1575, Sir [[George Bruce of Carnock]] of [[Culross]], [[Scotland]], opened the first coal mine to extract coal from a "moat pit" under the sea on the [[Firth of Forth]]. He constructed an artificial loading island into which he sank a 40&amp;nbsp;ft shaft that connected to another two shafts for drainage and improved ventilation. The technology was far in advance of any coal mining method in the late medieval period and was considered one of the industrial wonders of the age.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | series = The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature | title = From Columba to the Union (Until 10707) | first = Ian | last = Brown}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century a number of advances in mining techniques were made, such the use of [[Boring (earth)|test boring]] to find suitable deposits and [[chain pump]]s, driven by [[water wheel]]s, to drain the collieries.&lt;ref name = "Galloway 1882" /&gt;{{rp |57–9}}

North American coal deposits were first discovered by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake in central New Brunswick, Canada in the 1600s. Coal seams were exposed where rivers flowed into the lake and was dug by hand off the surface and from tunnels dug into the seam. About 1631 the French made their fur trading post at the mouth of the Saint John River their main post in Acadia and started construction of a new fort. The main residence at the fort was designed with two 11 foot wide fireplaces which were stocked with wood and coal from up river. As early as 1643, the French were sending coal and other supplies to the British colony at Boston.

==Industrial Revolution==
The [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the 18th century, and later spread to continental [[Europe]], [[North America]], and [[Japan]], was based on the availability of coal to power [[steam engine]]s. International trade expanded exponentially when coal-fed steam engines were built for the [[railway]]s and [[steamship]]s during the [[Victorian era]]. Coal was cheaper and much more efficient than [[wood fuel]] in most steam engines. As central and [[Northern England]] contains an abundance of coal, many mines were situated in these areas as well as the [[South Wales coalfield]] and [[Scotland]]. The small-scale techniques were unsuited to the increasing demand, with extraction moving away from surface extraction to deep [[shaft mining]] as the Industrial Revolution progressed.&lt;ref&gt;Flinn and Stoker (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[steamship]]s traveled overseas from the industrialized countries of Europe their need for coal served as trigger for coal mining to start at various locations across the globe. An example of this is the [[Coal mining in Chile|coal mining in Zona Centro Sur]], Chile, that began as a response to the arrival of steamships to [[Talcahuano]].&lt;ref name=VivaBrito&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vivallos Espinoza |first=Carlos |last2=Brito Peña |first2=Alejandra |date=2010 |title=Inmigración y sectores populares en las minas de carbón de Lota y Coronel (Chile 1850-1900)|trans-title=Immigration and popular sectors in the coal mines of Lota and Coronel (Chile 1850-1900) |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-04622010000100005&amp;script=sci_arttext |journal=[[Atenea]] |volume=501 |issue= |pages=73–94 |doi= |access-date=|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Britain==
[[File:British.coalfields.19th.century.jpg|thumb|British coalfields in the nineteenth century.]]

===Pre 1900===
Although some deep mining took place as early as the 1500s (in [[North East England]], and along the [[Firth of Forth]] coast)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Papers on Mining in Scotland, 18th and 19th centuries|publisher =Archives Hub|url =http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02092505.html|accessdate =2008-10-17|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://archive.is/20120801191243/http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/02092505.html|archivedate =2012-08-01|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Culross |publisher=BBC| url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/europe/trails_europe_culross.shtml | accessdate = 2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deep shaft mining in the UK began to develop extensively in the late 18th century, with rapid expansion throughout the 19th century and early 20th century when the industry peaked. The location of the [[coalfield]]s helped to make the prosperity of [[Lancashire]], of [[Yorkshire]], and of [[South Wales]]. The Yorkshire pits which supplied [[Sheffield]] were only about 300 feet deep. [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] were the leading coal producers and they were the sites of the first deep pits. In much of Britain coal was worked from [[drift mine]]s, or scraped off when it outcropped on the surface. Small groups of part-time miners used shovels and primitive equipment.

Scottish miners had been bonded to their "maisters" by a 1606 Act "Anent Coalyers and Salters". A [[Colliers and Salters (Scotland) Act 1775]], recognised this to be "a state of slavery and bondage" and formally abolished it; this was made effective by a further law in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Erskine May on Slavery in Britain (Vol. III, Chapter XI) | url =http://www.pdavis.nl/ErskineMay.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Barrowman, Mining Engineer |title =Slavery In The Coal-Mines Of Scotland |date= 14 September 1897 |publisher=Scottish Mining Website | url =http://www.scottishmining.co.uk/429.html | accessdate = 2017-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1800 a great deal of coal was left in places as extraction was still primitive. As a result, in the deep [[Tyneside]] pits (300 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;ft deep) only about 40 percent of the coal could be extracted. The use of wooden pit props to support the roof was an innovation first introduced about 1800. The critical factor was circulation of air and control of dangerous explosive gases. At first fires were burned at the bottom of the "upcast" shaft to create air currents and circulate air, but replaced by fans driven by steam engines. Protection for miners came with the invention of the [[Davy lamp]] and [[Geordie lamp]], where any [[firedamp]] (or [[methane]]) burnt harmlessly within the lamp. It was achieved by restricting the ingress of air with either metal gauze or fine tubes, but the illumination from such lamps was very poor. Great efforts were made to develop better safe lamps, such as the Mueseler produced in the Belgian pits near [[Liège]].

Coal was so abundant in Britain that the supply could be stepped up to meet the rapidly rising demand. In 1700 the annual output of coal was just under 3 million tons. Between 1770 and 1780 the annual output of coal was some 6¼ million [[long ton]]s (or about the output of a week and a half in the 20th century). After 1790 output soared, reaching 16 million long tons by 1815 at the height of the [[Napoleonic War]]. By 1830 this had risen to over 30 million tons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=A Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave|pages=109–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miners, less affected by imported labour or machines than were the [[cotton mill]] workers, had begun to form [[trade union]]s and fight their grim battle for wages against the coal owners and royalty-lessees.&lt;ref&gt;J. Steven Watson; ''The Reign of George III, 1760-1815.'' 1960. p, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of women and children (at a fraction of the cost of men) was common until abolished in an Act of August 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Townhill: Dunfermline Coaltown, by William D. Henderson&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Wales, the miners showed a high degree of solidarity. They lived in isolated villages where the miners comprised the great majority of workers. There was a high degree of equality in life style; combined with an evangelical religious style based on Methodism this led to an ideology of egalitarianism. They forged a "community of solidarity" - under the leadership of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners Federation]]. The union supported first the Liberal Party, then after 1918 Labour, with some Communist Party activism at the fringes.&lt;ref name="Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40"&gt;Stefan Llafur Berger, "Working-Class Culture and the Labour Movement in the South Wales and the Ruhr Coalfields, 1850-2000: A Comparison," ''Journal of Welsh Labour History/Cylchgrawn Hanes Llafur Cymru'' (2001) 8#2 pp 5-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-1900===
The need to maintain coal supplies (a primary energy source) had figured in both [[world war]]s.&lt;ref name="Fine 1990"&gt;Fine (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; As well as energy supply, coal became a very political issue, due to conditions under which colliers worked and the way they were treated by colliery owners. Much of the 'old [[Left-wing politics|Left]]' of British politics can trace its origins to coal-mining areas, with the main labour union being the [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain]], founded in 1888. The MFGB claimed 600,000 members in 1908. (The MFGB later became the more centralised [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]]).

Although other factors were involved, one cause of the [[UK General Strike of 1926]] was concerns colliers had over very dangerous working conditions, reduced pay and longer shifts.

Technological development throughout the 19th and 20th centuries helped both to improve the safety of colliers and the productive capacity of collieries they worked. In the late 20th century, improved integration of coal extraction with bulk industries such as electrical generation helped coal maintain its position despite the emergence of alternative energies supplies such as oil, natural gas and, from the late 1950s, [[nuclear power]] used for electricity. More recently coal has faced competition from renewable energy sources and bio-fuels.

Most of the coal mines in Britain were purchased by the government in 1947 and put under the control of the [[National Coal Board]], with only the smaller mines left in private ownership. The NUM had campaigned for nationalisation for decades and, once it was achieved, sought to work with the NCB in managing the industry and discouraged strikes. Under the chairmanship of [[Alf Robens]], pit closures became widespread as coal's place in energy generation declined. The NUM leadership continued to resist calls for strike action, but an [[UK miners' strike (1969)|unofficial strike began in 1969]] after a conference pledge on the hours of surface-workers was not acted upon. This was a watershed moment that led to increased spending on the coal industry and a much slower rate of pit closures, as well as the election of more militant officials to the NUM leadership. Under the government of Ted Heath, an [[UK miners' strike (1972)|official strike in 1972]] won increased wages after the Wilberforce Commission. Less than two years later, Heath called a general election over another official strike, called after an overtime ban had led to a [[Three Day Week]] in Britain, and lost the election to the Labour Party. The wage demands were then met and spending on the industry continued to increase, including the establishment of the new [[Selby Coalfield]].

By the early 1980s, many pits were almost 100 years' old and were considered uneconomic&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Thatcher, quoted in B. Fine, The coal question: political economy and industrial change from the Nineteenth Century to the present day&lt;/ref&gt; to work at then current wage rates compared to cheap [[North Sea oil]] and gas, and in comparison to subsidy levels in [[Europe]]. [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|The Miners' Strike of 1984]] failed to stop the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government's plans under [[Margaret Thatcher]] to shrink the industry, and a break-away [[Union of Democratic Mineworkers]] was founded by miners, mostly in the Midlands, who felt that the NUM had broken its own democratic rules in calling the strike. The [[National Coal Board]] (by then [[British Coal]]), was privatised by selling off a large number of pits to private concerns through the mid-1990s. Because of exhausted seams, high prices and cheap imports, the mining industry disappeared almost completely, despite the militant protests of some miners.&lt;ref name="Fine 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Curtis, "A Tradition of Radicalism: The Politics of the South Wales Miners, 1964-1985," ''Labour History Review'' (2011) 76#1 pp 34-50&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, the [[South Wales Valleys]] last deep pit mine, [[Tower Colliery]] in Hirwaun, [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] closed with the loss of 120 jobs. The coal was exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7200432.stm BBC ''Coal mine closes with celebration'' 25 January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2015 coal was still mined at [[Hatfield Colliery|Hatfield]], [[Kellingley Colliery|Kellingley]] and [[Thoresby Colliery|Thoresby]] Collieries, and is extracted at several very large opencast pits in South Wales, Scotland and elsewhere. Kellingley Colliery was the last deep coal mine in operation in the UK and its last coaling shift was on 18 December 2015 when coaling operations ceased with the loss of 450 jobs bringing deep coal mining in the UK to an end in its entirety, a skeleton team of men will remain to service the colliery until it is finally dismantled.

Coal mining was never a major industry in Ireland, apart from a spell in the mid-19th century when east Tyrone collieries were at their peak. [[Deerpark Mines]] was the largest opencast site. In 1919 it got rail connections and reached peak production in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Alan McCutcheon|title=The Industrial Archaeology of Northern Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypR3QWtmBRoC&amp;pg=PA108-IA27|year=1984|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson U.P.|page=108|isbn=9780838631256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of coal mining in the United States}}

[[Anthracite]] (or "hard" coal), clean and smokeless, became the preferred fuel in cities, replacing wood by about 1850. [[Bituminous coal|Bituminous]] (or "soft coal") mining came later. In the mid-century [[Pittsburgh]] was the principal market. After 1850 soft coal, which is cheaper but dirtier, came into demand for railway locomotives and stationary [[steam engine]]s, and was used to make [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for [[steel]] after 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Binder (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

Total coal output soared until 1918; before 1890, it doubled every ten years, going from 8.4 million short tons in 1850 to 40 million in 1870, 270 million in 1900, and peaking at 680 million short tons in 1918. New soft coal fields opened in [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]], as well as [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Alabama]]. The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s lowered the demand to 360 million short tons in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce C. Netschert and Sam H. Schurr, ''Energy in the American Economy, 1850-1975: An Economic Study of Its History and Prospects.'' pp 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[John L. Lewis]], the United Mine Workers (UMW) became the dominant force in the coal fields in the 1930s and 1940s, producing high wages and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky and Van Tine (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914 at the peak there were 180,000 anthracite miners; by 1970 only 6,000 remained. At the same time [[steam engine]]s were phased out in railways and factories, and [[bituminous coal]] was used primarily for the generation of [[electricity]]. Employment in bituminous peaked at 705,000 men in 1923, falling to 140,000 by 1970 and 70,000 in 2003. UMW membership among active miners fell from 160,000 in 1980 to only 16,000 in 2005, as coal mining became more mechanized and non-union miners predominated in the new coal fields.

In the 1960s a series of mergers saw coal production shift from small, independent coal companies to large, more diversified firms. Several oil companies and electricity producers acquired coal companies or leased Federal coal reserves in the west of the United States. Concerns that competition in the coal industry could decline as a result of these changes were heightened by a sharp rise in coal prices in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Coal prices fell in the 1980s, partly in response to oil price movements, but primarily in response to the large increase in supply worldwide which was brought about by the earlier price surge. During this period, the industry in the U.S. was characterized by a move towards low-sulfur coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibisworld.com/industry/retail.aspx?indid=108&amp;chid=7 "Coal Mining Industry Report"] IBISWorld, 2009''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Wyoming became the largest coal producing state. It uses strip mining exclusively. Wyoming's coal reserves total about 69.3 billion tons, or 14.2% of the U.S. coal reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Manuel Lujan|author2=Harry M. Snyder|title=Surface Coal Mining Reclamation: 15 Years of Progress, 1977-1992, Statistical Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f9skUgCfSEkC&amp;pg=PA68|year=1992|publisher=DIANE |page=68|isbn=9780788142154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, competition was intense in the US coal mining industry with some U.S. mines approaching the end of their useful life ([[mine closure]]).{{citation needed|date = August 2013}} Other coal-producing countries also stepped up production to win a share of traditional US export markets. Coal is used primarily to generate electricity, but the rapid drop in natural gas prices after 2008 created severe competition.

==Australia==
In 1984 Australia surpassed the US as the world's largest coal exporter. One-third of Australia's coal exports were shipped from the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, where coal mining and transport had begun nearly two centuries earlier. Coal River was the first name given by British settlers to the Hunter River after coal was found there in 1795. In 1804 the Sydney-based administration established a permanent convict settlement near the mouth of the Hunter River to mine and load the coal, predetermining the town's future as a coal port by naming it Newcastle. Today, Newcastle, NSW, is the largest coal port in the world.
Now the state of Queensland is Australia's top coal producer, with its Bowen Basin the main source of black coal, and plans by miners such as [[Gina Rinehart]] to open up the Galilee and Surat Basins to coal mining.

==Canada==
Canadian coal mining started in New Brunswick and also occurred in Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan. The United States has been a major supplier for the industrial regions of [[Ontario]]. By 2000 about 19% of Canada's energy was supplied by coal, much of it imported from the U.S while Eastern Canadian ports import considerable coal from [[Venezuela]].

===New Brunswick===

The first coal mining in North America began in New Brunswick, Canada in the early 1600s. Coal was found by French explorers and fur traders along the shores of Grand Lake where rivers and erosion had exposed the coal. Small amounts of coal were dug from surface deposits and tunnels dug into the coal seams, and this coal supplied Fort Saint Marie, built by the French about 1632 at the mouth of the Saint John River. The French sold coal to the British colony at Boston as early as 1639. Due to this earliest export of coal in North America, Grand Lake has been recognized as a Canadian Historic Site . Coal mining expanded after the British took control of the area in the mid 1700s and encouraged permanent settlements in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario by British Loyalists. Beginning in 1765, over 11,000 Loyalists settled in N.B., most along the lower 100 miles of the Saint John River and around Grand Lake. Approximately 200,000 tons of coal were dug at Grand Lake between 1639 and 1887 using surface collection, vertical shafts and the room and pillar system. By 1920, the use of draglines and other modern equipment made strip mining possible and the privately owned Grand Lake area mines produced over 200,000 tons per year. Most of this coal was used by the railroad and large businesses. By 1936, a coal burning electric power generating plant at Newcastle Creek was operating with two 33,000 volt lines going to Fredericton and one 66,000 volt line going to Marysville. By 1950, coal production at Grand Lake often reached 1 million tons per year. In 1969, all the privately owned Grand Lake area coal companies and approximately 1,000 employees were consolidated into one provincial government controlled company named N.B. Coal Ltd.. In 2009, the increasing availability of oil and environmental concerns with coal use caused the closing of the Grand Lake coal mines and New Brunswick's coal mining industry.

=== Nova Scotia===
[[File:Stellarton FoordSeam 077.JPG|thumb|left|Foord Coal Seam, [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]]]]
The first coal mining in Nova Scotia began in the 18th century with small hand-dug mines close to the sea at [[Joggins, Nova Scotia]] and in the [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] area of [[Cape Breton Island]]. Large scale coal mining began in the late 1830s when the General Mining Association (GMA), a group of English mining investors, obtained a coal mining monopoly in Nova Scotia. They imported the latest in mining technology including steam water pumps and railways to develop large mines in the [[Stellarton, Nova Scotia|Stellarton]] area of [[Pictou County, Nova Scotia]], including the Foord Pit which by 1866 was the deepest coal mine in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |title="History of the Site", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317051008/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/about/museumsite.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal mining also developed in [[Springhill, Nova Scotia|Springhill]] and [[Joggins]] in [[Cumberland County, Nova Scotia]]. After the GMA monopoly expired, the largest and longest lasting mines developed at [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]] in [[Nova Scotia]]. Nova Scotia was the major supplier of Canadian coal until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |title="Coal Mining", ''Nova Scotia Museum of Industry'' |access-date=2011-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318064424/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/moi/en/home/novascotiaindustry/coalmining/default.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak in 1949 25,000 miners dug 17 million metric tons of coal from Nova Scotian mines. The miners, who lived in company towns, became politically active in [[left-wing politics]] during labour struggles for safety and fair wages. [[Westray Mine]] near Stellarton closed in 1992 after an explosion killed 26 miners. All the subsurface mines were closed by 2001, although some open pit coal mining continues near Stellarton. The [[Nova Scotia Museum of Industry]] at Stellarton explores the history of mining in the province from its location on the site of the Foord Pit.

===Alberta===
Coal was easy to find in what is now [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]], Canada. The [[Atlas Coal Mine]] National Historic Site has turned this coalfield into a museum. This museum interprets how the [[Blackfoot]] and [[Cree]] knew about the "black rock that burned." After many explorers reported coal in the area, a handful of ranchers and homesteaders dug out the coal for their homes. [[Sam Drumheller]] started the coal rush in this area when he bought the land from a local rancher, which he then sold to the [[Canadian National Railway]]. Sam Drumheller also registered a coal mine. However, before his mine opened [[Jesse Gouge]] and [[Garnet Coyle]] beat him to it by opening the [[Newcastle Mine]]. Once the railway was built thousands of people came to mine this area.

By the end of 1912, there were nine working coal mines, in [[Newcastle, Alberta|Newcastle]], Drumheller, [[Midland, Alberta|Midland]], [[Rosedale, Alberta|Rosedale]], and [[Wayne, Alberta|Wayne]]. In years to follow more mines sprang up: [[Nacmine, Alberta|Nacmine]], [[Cambria, Alberta|Cambria]], Willow Creek, Lehigh, and [[East Coulee, Alberta|East Coulee]]. The timing of the Drumheller mine industry was "lucky" according to the Atlas National Historical Site, in that the [[United Mine Workers]] union had recently won the right for better working conditions. As a result of union action, child labour laws were passed to prevent boys under 14 years old working underground.&lt;ref&gt;Robert McIntosh, ''Boys in the pits: Child labour in coal mines'' (McGill-Queen's Press-MQUP, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Miners' camps in this area were called "hell's holes" because miners lived in tents and shacks. These camps were filled with drinking, gambling and watching fistfights as forms of recreation. With time, living conditions improved: little houses took the place of the tents, and more women joined the men and started families. With new activities such as hockey, baseball and theatre the camps were no longer "hell's holes" but became "the wonder town of the west."

Between 1911 and 1979, 139 mines were registered in the [[Drumheller Valley]], of which only 34 were productive for many years. The beginning of the end for the Drumheller mining industry was the discovery of oil at [[Leduc No. 1]] in 1947, after which [[natural gas]] became the predominant fuel for heating homes in western Canada. As the demand for coal dropped, mines closed and communities suffered. Some communities, Willow Creek for example, completely vanished while others went from boomtowns to ghost towns.

Atlas #4 Mine shipped its last load of coal in 1979, after which the Atlas Coal Mine National Historic Site has preserved the last of the Drumheller mines. Also nearby, [[East Coulee School Museum]] interprets the life of families in mine towns for its visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlascoalmine.ab.ca/] "Atlas Coal Mine National Historical Site"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Courrières 1906 LeJ.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' the 1906 Courrières mine disaster in France]]

Pierre-Francois Tubeuf laid the foundations of the modern industry in France, starting in 1770 in Languedoc.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynne Lewis, ''The Advent of Modern Capitalism in France, 1770-1840: The Contribution of Pierre-François Tubeuf'' (1993) [http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198228950.003.0002 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Labor unions emerged with an emphasis on the safety issue in the late 19th century. In 1885, there were 175 injuries per thousand workers per year. Deaths were low in most years 2 per 1000 workers), but major disaster was always a threat. 1099 men died in the [[Courrières mine disaster]] of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen J.

Unions gain strength by setting up a system of worker elected mine-safety delegates. The national government encouraged the mine safety movement as a means of limiting strife in the sometimes turbulent coal fields.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Reid, "The role of mine safety in the development of working-class consciousness and organization: The case of the Aubin Coal Basin, 1867-1914."

==Germany==
[[File:CoalDNLBF.png|thumb|Historical coalfields of Western Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Northern France]]
The first important mines appeared in the 1750s, in the valleys of the rivers Ruhr, Inde and Wurm where coal seams outcropped and horizontal adit mining was possible. In 1782 the [[Krupp]] family began operations near [[Essen]]. After 1815 entrepreneurs in the [[Ruhr Area]], which then became part of [[Prussia]] took advantage of the tariff zone ([[Zollverein]]) to open new mines and associated [[iron]] smelters. New railways were built by British engineers around 1850. Numerous small industrial centres sprang up, focused on [[ironworks]], using local coal. The iron and [[steel]] works typically bought mines, and erected [[coking]] ovens to supply their own requirements in [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] and gas. These integrated coal-iron firms ("Huettenzechen") became numerous after 1854; after 1900 they became mixed firms called "Konzern."

The average output of a mine in 1850 was about 8,500 short tons; its employment about 64. By 1900, the average mine's output had risen to 280,000 and the employment to about 1,400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=Why was Britain first? The Industrial revolution in global context|url=https://www.academia.edu/1940258/Why_was_Britain_first_The_industrial_revolution_in_global_context|work=Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total [[Ruhr]] coal output rose from 2.0 million short tons in 1850 to 22 in 1880, 60 in 1900, and 114 in 1913, on the verge of war. In 1932 output was down to 73 million short tons, growing to 130 in 1940. Output peaked in 1957 (at 123 million), declining to 78 million short tons in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Pounds (1952)&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2010 five coal mines were producing in Germany.

The miners in the Ruhr region were divided by ethnicity (with Germans and Poles) and religion (Protestants and Catholics). Mobility in and out of the mining camps to nearby industrial areas was high. The miners split into several unions, with an affiliation to a political party. As a result, the socialist union (affiliated with the Social Democratic Party) competed with Catholic and Communist unions until 1933, when the Nazis took over all of them. After 1945 the socialists came to the fore.&lt;ref name="Stefan Llafur Berger 2001 pp 5-40"/&gt;

==Belgium==
By 1830 when iron and later steel became important in [[Wallonia]] the [[Belgian]] coal industry had long been established, and used [[steam engine]]s for pumping. The Belgian coalfield lay near the navigable [[River Meuse]], so coal was shipped downstream to the ports and cities of the [[Rhine]]-Meuse-[[Scheldt]] [[river delta|delta]]. The opening of the [[Saint-Quentin Canal]] in 1810 allowed coal to go by barge to [[Paris]]. The Belgian coalfield outcrops over most of its area, and the highly folded nature of the coal seams, part of the geological [[Rhenohercynian Zone]], meant that surface occurrences of the coal were very abundant. Deep mines were not required at first, so a large number of small operations sprang up. There was a complex legal system for concessions, and often multiple layers had different owners. Entrepreneurs started going deeper and deeper, thanks to the good pumping system. In 1790, the maximum depth of mines was {{convert|220|m|ft|sp=us}}. By 1856, the average depth in the [[Borinage]] was {{convert|361|m|ft|sp=us}}, and in 1866, {{convert|437|m|ft|sp=us}} and some pits had reached down {{convert|700|to|900|m|ft|-2|sp=us}}; one was {{convert|1065|m|ft|sp=us}} deep, probably the deepest coal mine in [[Europe]] at this time. Gas explosions were a serious problem, and Belgium had high coal miner fatality rates. By the late 19th century the seams were becoming exhausted, and the steel industry was importing some coal from the [[Ruhr]].&lt;ref&gt;Parker and Pounds (1957)&lt;/ref&gt; André Dumont's discovery in 1900 of coal in the [[Campine]] basin, in the Belgian Province Limburg, prompted entrepreneurs from Liège to open coal mines, mainly producing coal for the steel industry. An announced reorganisation of the Belgian coal mines in 1965 resulted in strikes and a revolt which led to the death of two coal miners in 1966 at the Zwartberg mine. Coal was mined in the Liège basin until 1980, in the Southern Wallonian basin until 1984, and in the Campine basin until 1992.

==Poland==
The first permanent coal mine in Poland was established in [[Szczakowa]] near [[Jaworzno]] in 1767. In 19th century development of iron, copper and lead mining and processing in southern Poland (notably in the [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]] and later in the region of [[Silesia]]) led to a quick development of coal mining. Among the most prominent deposits are those located in what are now the [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region]] and [[Rybnik Coal Area]] (formerly part of [[Prussia]]) and the [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]] on the Russian side of the border.

In modern times coal is still considered a strategic resource for Poland's economy, as it covers roughly 65% of energetic needs. Before and after [[World War II]] Poland has been one of the major coal producers worldwide, usually listed among the five largest. However, after 1989 the coal production is in decline, with the overall production for 1994 reaching 132 million metric tons, 112 million metric tons in 1999 and 104 million metric tons in 2002.

==Russia==
From the 1860s large deposits in the Don Basin ("Donbas") in southern Russia supplied 87% of Russia's coal. It was used by railways and the iron and steel industry. After 1900 smaller deposits near Dombrovo, Zabaikal and Cheremkhovo in Siberia were opened. Small older mines south of Moscow also operated. Coal production was controlled by inefficient Russo-British syndicates, and there were shortages of workers, so the companies set up welfare systems for them. Their smallish output and the weak Russian railway system centered on the Ekaterininskaia (Krivoi Rog) Railway held back the growth of Russian heavy industry.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Solovyova, "The Railway System in the Mining Area of Southern Russia in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries," ''Journal of Transport History'' (1984) 5#1 pp 66-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan P. MaCaffray, "Origins of Labor Policy in the Russian Coal and Steel Industry, 1874-1900," ''Journal of Economic History'' (1987) 47#4 pp 951-67 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2122039 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John P. McKay, ''Pioneers for Profit: Foreign Entrepreneurship and Russian Industrialization,  1885-1913'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Second World War the loss of 60% of the mining areas to German invaders forced the rapid expansion of mines in the Urals, as well as greater use of mines in the Kuznetsk Basin in Siberia. In 1939 the Urals produced only half the fuel needed by local industry. During the war the mines were expanded and over 700 factories were evacuated from the west, greatly increasing the demand for Ural coal. Prisoners from the Gulag were sent to the mines; up to a third of the workers were women. The miners were given much higher rations of food. Output doubled and the share of the region in the total national coal production rose from 8% to 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Scott Dunn|title=The Soviet Economy and the Red Army, 1930-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dcAgT_2uiYgC&amp;pg=PA38|year=1995|publisher=Greenwood |page=38|isbn=9780275948931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989-91 militant coal miners in Russia and Ukraine were the mainstay of the revolutionary forced which finally overthrew the Communist system in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Burawoy and Pavel Michael, "Russian Miners Bow to the Angel of History," ''Antipode'' (Jan 1995) 27#2 pp 115-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Donets Basin is the major coal-mining district in eastern Ukraine and adjacent portions of Russia. Production during 2009 was 68.7 million tons in the Ukrainian and 4.9million tons in the Russian part of the basin, but coal gas is a major hazard.&lt;ref&gt;R.F. Sachsenhofer et al.

==India==

Commercial exploitation began in 1774, John Sumner and [[Suetonius Grant Heatly]] of the [[East India Company]] setting up operations in the [[Raniganj Coalfield]] along the Western bank of river [[Damodar River|Damodar]]. Due to a lack of demand growth was sluggish until 1853, with the introduction of steam locomotives to the fast-expanding rail system.

As late as 1895, India imported large quantities of coal from Britain, but as domestic production increased and was found to be suitable for locomotives and ships, demand for coal imports declined dramatically. India's export of coal increased, especially to Burma, Ceylon, and the Malay states.&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Ghosh, "India's Foreign Trade in Coal Before Independence: A Note," ''Indian Economic and Social History Review'' (Oct 1969) 6#4 pp 431-437&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900 production had risen to an annual average of 1 million [[tonne]] (mt) and India was producing 6.12 mts. per year by 1900{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} and 18 mts per year by 1920.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Temporary wartime demand (1914-1918) was followed by a slump in the 1930s. The production reached a level of 29 mts. by 1942 and 30 mts. by 1946.

After India became independent, the new government stressed the rapid growth of heavy industry. The National Coal Development Corporation was founded in 1956 (as a Government of India) undertaking. The founding of this body was major step in the development of an indigenous Indian coal sector. Especially important was the development of the vast [[Dhanbad]] coal-mining complex with such major operations as Tata Steel, BCCL, ECL and IISCO (Indian Iron And Steel Company), as well as the Indian School of Mines to train engineers, geologists and managers.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Commander, "Industrialization and Sectoral Imbalance: Coal Mining and the Theory of Dualism in Colonial and Independent India," ''Journal of Peasant Studies'' (1981) 9#1 pp 86-96&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, Indonesia has expanded its coal mining and by 2011 ranked #5 globally in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael S. Hamilton|title=Mining Environmental Policy: Comparing Indonesia and the USA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjx4paALjRsC|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754644934}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011 Kazakhstan ranks in the top ten in terms of coal production and reserves. Lignite ("brown coal") remains important with Germany, China and Russia the largest producers.&lt;ref&gt;World Coal Association, ''Coal Facts 2012'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disasters==
{{main|Mining disasters}}
[[File:Senghenydd pit disaster 1.jpg|thumb|Removing bodies from the pit at Senghenydd, 1913]]
[[File:Courrières 1906 LeJ.jpg|thumb|The Courrières mine disaster in France in 1906]]
Mining has always been especially dangerous, because of explosions, roof cave-ins, and the difficulty of underground rescue. The worst single disaster in British coal mining history was at [[Senghenydd Colliery Disaster|Senghenydd]] in the [[South Wales coalfield]]. On the morning of 14 October 1913 an explosion and subsequent fire killed 436 men and boys. Only 72 bodies were recovered. It followed a series of many extensive [[Mining accident]]s in the late 19th century, such as [[The Oaks explosion]] of 1866 and the [[Hartley Colliery Disaster]] of 1862. Most of the explosions were caused by [[firedamp]] ignitions followed by coal dust explosions. At Hartley there was no explosion, but the miners entombed when the single shaft was blocked by a broken cast iron beam from the haulage engine.
Deaths were mainly caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, known as [[afterdamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Mason | first = T. | first2 = Peter | last2 = Atkinson | title = The Hartley Pit Disaster | work = The Science and Art of Mining | publisher = Durham Mining Museum | year = 1911 | url = http://www.dmm.org.uk/archives/a_hart01.htm | accessdate = 3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Courrières mine disaster]], Europe's worst mining accident, caused the death of 1,099 miners in Northern France on 10 March 1906. The [[Benxihu Colliery]] accident in China on April 26, 1942, killed 1,549 miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Marcel Barrois | publisher=Le Monde | date=March 10, 2006 | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3226,36-749532,0.html|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as disasters directly affecting mines, there have been disasters attributable to the impact of mining on the surrounding landscapes and communities. The [[Aberfan disaster]] in 1966 buried a school in South Wales when a huge slag heap collapsed, killing 116 children and 28 adults.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5375">[[File:Huub van Doorne (1965).jpg|thumb|Huub van Doorne (1965)]]
'''Hubert Jozef (“Hub”) van Doorne''' (1 January 1900 – 23 May 1979) was the founder of Van Doorne's Aanhangwagenfabriek (Trailer factory) and of Van Doorne's Automobielfabriek (vehicle factory) known as [[DAF Trucks|DAF]], together with his brother Willem (Wim) van Doorne.

==Early years==
Van Doorne was born in [[America, Netherlands|America]], a confusingly named small town in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]], the son of blacksmith Martin van Doorne (1870–1912) by his marriage to Petronella Vervoort (1866–1952). In March 1912 the family moved to [[Deurne, North Brabant|Deurne]] where van Doorne’s father almost immediately died.

Van Doorne was keen to take on his father’s business, but was considered too young: instead he became an apprentice in the small Mandiger machine factory of nearby [[Eindhoven]].

==Early career==
After the [[First World War]] van Doorn was employed as a chauffeur-mechanic by a well known local doctor named [[:nl: Hendrik Wiegersma|Hendrik Wiegersma]]. Subsequently he worked for the De Valk [[brewery]]. In 1920 he established his own business concentrating on metal working involving items such as stoves, bicycles and motor vehicles.  However, he gave up on this business after four years and returned to Mandiger's as company manager.

==Van Doorne's Aanhangwagenfabriek N.V. and its successor==
[[Image:Pivgetriebe.png|thumb|right| Belt and pulleys of a [[Van Doorne transmission]] | alt= A pair of conical pulleys, with a flat belt running between them. ]]
With financial support from the brewery by whom he had been employed ten years earlier,&lt;ref name=Autocar197101/&gt; van Doorne returned to self-employment in April 1928, establishing his own metal based manufacturing and repair business, concentrating on items such as cabinets, ladders, window frames and, increasingly, trailers which led to the business being renamed in 1932 as van Doorne's Aanhangwagenfabriek (DAF).&lt;ref name=Autocar197101&gt;{{cite magazine| authorlink = Geoffrey Howard|title = DAF Today|magazine=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = 134 (nbr 3905)| pages =36–39|date = 28 January 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the business initially employed just four people, including Hub and his brother Wim, in just one year it expanded to the point where it employed 30 people.  The business subsequently expanded into truck production and, during the [[Second World War]], production of military vehicles.   It was on account of the move into powered vehicles that the firm’s name was changed again to Van Doorne's Automobielfabriek (DAF).

The business evolved as a partnership between Hub and his brother Wim, with Hub retaining responsibility for technical and engineering aspects of the business and his brother Wim looking after the financial and administrative aspects.  It was Hub who would develop and apply the concept of [[continuously variable transmission]] for which the firm would become well known in the 1950s and 1960s. Their [[Van Doorne transmission]], using a belt drive between two adjustable coned pulleys, was widely used as the ''[[Variomatic]]'' in small [[Daf]] cars.

==Personal==
Van Doorne married on 15 July 1929,  Henrica Maria Reijnders (1905–1987), the daughter of a substantial local retailer.  She would later receive papal commendation for her energetic work in the social field. The couple produced five recorded children.

For a time the van Doorne family lived in Eindhoven, but they soon returned to [[Deurne, North Brabant|Deurne]], and were still living there in 1979 when Hub died.  He was buried at the local Jacobshof cemetery where today his body lies in a protected area beside those of his wife and three of his children Anny (1930–2004), Jeffrey (1932–2006) and Piet (1934–1982).

'''Jason Silas''' "'''Jase'''" '''Robertson''' (born August 16, 1969) is an American television star on the [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] reality television show ''[[Duck Dynasty]]'', the COO of the business [[Duck Commander]], an innovator, and a professional duck hunter. Jase Robertson lives in [[West Monroe, Louisiana]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} with his wife, Missy, and his three children Reed, Cole and Mia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetv.com/duck-dynasty/robertson-family-tree ''Robertson Family Tree''], aetv.com; retrieved June 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for avoiding work in favor of hunting and fishing, speaking "duckinese", and for his self-proclaimed frog-hunting abilities. He calls himself "a [[frog]]'s worst nightmare".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/duck-dynasty-duck-calls-enrich-family-1.3607727|title='Duck Dynasty': Duck calls enrich family |publisher=Newsday|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2016}}
Jase Robertson was born to [[Phil Robertson|Phil]] and Marsha "Kay" Robertson in [[Bernice, Louisiana]]. His parents gave him the middle name of ''Silas'', naming him after his uncle [[Silas Robertson]], Phil's brother. Jase also has 3 brothers Alan, Willie, and Jeptha. Growing up with his father as the town's ''Duck Commander'', Jase wanted to spend as much time with him as possible, going on various hunting expeditions to strengthen their bond. Soon, Robertson developed the same passion for the sport that his dad has. From the age of eight, Robertson wanted to spend as much time in the rugged lifestyle in the woods as possible, even missing the maximum possible amount of school days as allowed by Louisiana law.

==Business with Duck Commander==
{{one source|section|date=June 2016}}
With his brother [[Willie Robertson|Willie]] as the CEO of the business, Jase Robertson is the COO of [[Duck Commander]]. Robertson's job at [[Duck Commander]] is to fabricate the duck calls made by the company, fine-tune them, and to invent new ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetv.com/duck-dynasty/meet-family/jase-robertson Jase Robertson profile], aetv.com; accessed June 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It takes him about two to three minutes to make one duck call. One of Jase's inventions is a duck call called the "Triple Threat", a duck call which utilizes three reeds instead of the usual two.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==''Duck Dynasty''==
Jase Robertson is one of the stars of [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]]'s reality show ''[[Duck Dynasty]]''. He is portrayed as a foil for [[Willie Robertson]], and often acts as a mischief maker. Jase said he thought that the show would never take off as a popular series. He stated in an interview with Fox News's Todd Starnes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was one of the ones who said the reality show would never work...We were in the hunting world. I had this perception of reality shows that you had to have all this friction and fits of rage and four-letter words...We're pretty calm compared to that...We've got some crazy characters in our family — but I didn't think people would want to see that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nation.foxnews.com/2013/06/14/starnes-exclusive-duck-dynasty-faith-family-and-facial-hair "Starnes Exclusive: 'Duck Dynasty' on Faith, Family and Facial Hair"], foxnews.com; retrieved June 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Paul "Jayso" Nuamah Donkor''' (born June 1, 1983) is a Ghanaian rapper, record producer, singer, songwriter and entrepreneur. After 10 years in the music industry as a rapper and producer, Jayso gained more attention following his work on [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]]'s second single, Borga, which featured on his debut album, Maakye. Jayso produced over 70 percent of the songs on that album which also shot him into the limelight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passion Turned Business|url=http://notionafrica.com/passion-turn-business-jayso-founderceo-of-skillions-records-record-producer-rapper-singer-and-sound-engineer/|website=www.notionafrica.com|publisher=Notion Africa|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jayso performs at Sabolai Radio.jpg|thumb|Jayso performs at Sabolai Radio #SabolaiRadio]]

==Early life==
During Jayso's teenage years at [[Presbyterian Boys' Senior High School]] (PRESEC-Legon) he formed Skillions, a critically acclaimed hip hop musical collective whose works not only served as the foundation and springboard for young artists to venture into hip hop, but also introduced locally brewed hip hop to the larger Ghanaian music community. Prior to this, Jayso joined another rapper producer JPE (now Kobi Onyame) with his friends Canz and Mr. Scratch to form the Haatsville Project. This resulted in the release of the Haatsville Project mixtape, which got a lot of people talking about it within the underground hip hop circuits of Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skillions Record Then and Now|url=http://ameyawdebrah.com/get-familiar-skillions-records-then-and-now/|website=www.ameyawdebrah.com|publisher=Ameyaw Debrah Media|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His current production credits include [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]], [[M.anifest]], [[Sway (musician)|Sway]], [[Scientific]], [[Kwaw Kese]], Jon Germain, [[Efya]], Rumor and Nigerian MCs [[Naeto C]] and Ikechukwu and Gabonese artiste Baponga.&lt;ref name=all1&gt;{{cite web|title=All You Need To Know About Jayso And Skillions Record|url=https://www.newsghana.com.gh/all-you-need-to-know-about-jayso-and-skillions-record/|website=www.newsghana.com.gh|publisher=News Ghana|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 2015, he released his debut album titled 'Making Tasha Proud' after over half a decade producing for others.&lt;ref name=stream1&gt;{{cite web|title=Stream Jayso's Debut Album 'Making Tasha Proud'|url=http://livefmghana.com/2015/12/10/stream-jaysos-debut-album-making-tasha-proud/|website=www.livefmghana.com|publisher=Live FM|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#NewsXMuse: Jayso releases tracklisting for new album, 'Making Tasha Proud'|url=http://museafrica.com/blog/2015/11/27/newsxmuse-jayso-releases-tracklisting-for-new-album-making-tasha-proud/|website=www.museafrica.com|publisher=Muse Media Networks|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Career/ Music career==
Jayso's relationship with music began during his childhood years. During Jayso's High School days at (Presec-Legon) he began to hone his skills first as a rapper and music producer. Prior to joining Haatsville, Jayso was rhyming with his pal T-Kube, who left [[Ghana]] for the UK in 2002 while in high school. He, together with JPE (now Kobi Onyame), Canz and Mr. Scratch (the Haatsville crew) put out the Haatsville Project tape. The tape received acclaim among hip hop lovers who were mostly the youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haatsville records|url=http://www.afrisson.com/Haatsville-Records-17089.html|website=www.afrisson.com|publisher=Afrisson|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Having built on his production knowledge courtesy of his association with Haatsville, Jayso started recruiting what eventually became the first hip hop group Skillions (Skills in a Million). Enlisting [[Ball J]], Jinx Therapy (now Frank P) as the original members of the Skillions, the likes of [[EL (rapper)|EL]], Midnight, J-Town, KP and Sandyswiz joined the Skillions family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get Familiar: Skillions Records then and now!!!|url=http://ameyawdebrah.com/get-familiar-skillions-records-then-and-now/|website=www.ameyawdebrah.com|publisher=Ameyaw Debrah Media|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the production supervision of Jayso (who could be described as the Ghanaian version of America's [[RZA]] of Skillions) the group released their ground-breaking 21 track debut 'Skillions Demotapes" mixtape in 2002. The recording of the mixtape happened entirely within the makeshift bedroom studio of Jayso. That tape gained a lot of success that led to the whole GH-Rap Movement.&lt;ref name=all1/&gt; The success of the mixtape was largely due to the production works and the style of music; they rapped mostly in English interspersed with pidgin (a Ghanaian version of broken English and local dialects) - which appealed to a large section of the youth. This eventually cemented Skillions' credentials as one of the talented rap groups of their time in Ghana. Even following the disbandment of the group, each Skillionaire is out making a name for himself within the music and arts scene. The breakup of the Skillions allowed them to pursue solo projects and led to Jayso forming another generation of Skillions. The New Generation comprised Lil Shaker, Rumour, Kevin Beats, Graffik, Killmatic, Padlock, Sandra, Gemini, Nobel and Joey B. The New Generation under the supervision of Jayso released 'The Skillions New Generation Mixtape' with hit songs such as 'Hood', 'Alert', 'Facebook Girl and Boy", 'I No Dey Biz' under his Skillion Records Imprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skillions Mixtape Out|url=https://www.modernghana.com/music/10530/skillions-mixtape-out.html|website=www.modernghana.com|publisher=Modern Ghana|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jayso has worked with almost every notable artiste within the music sphere in Ghana since 1999. Outside of Ghana, he has worked for one of hip hop legends [[Wyclef Jean]] and UK's [[Sway (musician)|Sway]]. Locally, he has produced works for the like of [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]], [[M.anifest]], [[R2Bees]], [[Efya]], [[Kwaw Kese]], Afro Rock Band Dark Suburb, VIP, [[Reggie Rockstone]], ASEM among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jayso Opens New Studio|url=http://www.peacefmonline.com/pages/showbiz/music/201301/152440.php|website=www.peacefmonline.com|publisher=Peacefmonline|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lay Away (feat.

'''Karol Franciszek Pollak''' (November 15, 1859 – December 17, 1928) was a [[Polish people|Polish]] [[electrotechnician]], [[inventor]] and [[businessman]].

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Sanok]], [[Poland]]. His father was Karol Pollak (1818–80) who was a [[printer (publishing)|printer]], bookseller and publisher, well known in [[Sanok]]. Karol (not to be mistaken with his father) worked in his youth as an [[electrician]] and showed great technical skills in it. In 1883 he was employed in the laboratory of British company "The Patent Utilisation Co". He designed and recorded his first patents in that period. In 1885 he attended [[electrotechnics]] studies at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Royal Polytechnic University in Charlottenburg]].

== Activity ==
In Berlin, Pollak ran electrotechnical factory "G. Wehr Telegraphen-Bau-Anstalt". Later he returned to Britain to commercialize his patents, which were released under anglicised version of his name, "Charles Pollak". In 1886, he became the director of a Paris company of electric tramways of his design. In the meantime he worked on the design of [[Electrochemical cell]]. He was very successful in this topic and it made him famous. Later he founded battery factories in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] and [[Liesing]], [[Austria]]. Many  battery-manufacturing companies have licensed his designs.

In 1899 he founded his own laboratory and proceeded with further research. He obtained 98 patents on his inventions.

In 1922 he returned to [[Poland]], where a year later he founded a factory in [[Biała Krakowska|Biała]], which exists to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.www.hawker.pl/pl/fabryka Fabryka Akumulatorów EnerSys Sp. z o.o]&lt;/ref&gt; The company started under the name of ''Polskie Towarzystwo Akumulatorowe'' and was co-founded by professor and president of [[Poland]], [[Ignacy Mościcki]]. However, Pollak was the first president of this company.

Pollak is sometimes referred as the ''Edison of Poland''. In 1925 he received the title [[Doctor Honoris Causa|doctor honoris causa]] of [[Warsaw Polytechnic|Warsaw University of Technology]].

== Most important inventions ==
[[File:Pollak akumulator.jpg|thumb|150px|Battery constructed by Karol Pollak]]
His numerous inventions also cover other areas, among them: [[electric motor]]s, [[color printing]] device, and a type of [[microphone]]. His main activity was related to [[chemical energy|chemical sources of energy]] - [[galvanic cell]]s and batteries. He obtained a patent for manufacturing [[Lead acid battery|lead-acid batteries]].

[[File:Pollak bridge.png|thumb|250px|Design of full rectifier included in Karol Pollak patent]]
He also has designed [[Rectifier|commutator and electrolytic rectifiers]]. In 1895 he was the first to suggest the use of [[Diode bridge|full bridge diode rectification circuit]],&lt;ref&gt;British patent [https://archive.is/20130807121725/https://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?window=1&amp;space=menu&amp;content=treffer&amp;action=bibdat&amp;docid=GB000189524398A 24398]&lt;/ref&gt; later known by [[Leo Graetz]]. In 1896, Pollak invented the [[electrolytic capacitor]]&lt;ref&gt;German patent [http://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=pdf&amp;docid=DE000000092564A D.R.P. 92564].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MSG Western New York''' (MSG WNY) is an [[United States|American]] [[regional sports network]] that is a joint venture between [[MSG Networks]] and [[Pegula Sports and Entertainment]]. The channel (also on occasion credited as ''Pegula Sports Network'' or ''MSG Buffalo'') is a sub-feed of [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]], with programming oriented towards the [[Western New York]] region, including coverage of the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Buffalo Sabres]] and the [[National Football League]]'s [[Buffalo Bills]]. It replaced MSG Network on television providers in the Sabres' media market in 2016.

MSG Western New York is available on [[cable television|cable]] providers throughout Western New York. Most programming is available nationwide on [[direct broadcast satellite|satellite]] via [[DirecTV]], with Sabres games requiring an [[NHL Center Ice]] subscription for out of market viewers; select programs are carried in Canada's [[Niagara Peninsula]] on a special channel set up for [[Bell TV]] subscribers that was founded in 2013.

==History==
After the collapse of [[Empire Sports Network]] and its parent [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adelphia adds NFL Net|url=https://variety.com/2005/tv/news/adelphia-adds-nfl-net-1117918998/|author=John Dempsey|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=March 6, 2005|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSG bought the rights to the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in 2006 under a 10-year deal; where telecasts are controlled by the team via the [[Sabres Hockey Network]], including the sale of advertising, and the simulcast of [[Rick Jeanneret]]'s commentary on both radio and television (although, during the 2015-16 season, the team experimented with having separate commentary teams on radio and television for selected games, which the ''[[Buffalo News]]'' speculated was in preparation for Jeanneret's eventual retirement), conditions that the Sabres always make as part of their telecast deals going back to the days of Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sabres.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=437214|title=Sabres Extend MSG Contract|date=September 1, 2006|work=Buffalo Sabres|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bn-rsnmaybe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabres in strong negotiation position as TV, radio deals near end|url=http://talkintv.buffalonews.com/2016/01/07/sabres-in-strong-negotiation-position-as-tv-radio-deals-near-end/|website=Buffalo News|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After acquiring the rights, MSG divided its network into three regional broadcast "zones"; Sabres games were available within "Zone 3", which covered Buffalo and Rochester, and "Zone 2", the remainder of the state excluding Buffalo, Rochester, and New York City—which was shared by the Sabres, Devils, Islanders, and Rangers. The exact channel assignment for Sabres games varied by region (some games were carried by [[MSG Plus|FSN New York]] in Zone 2), but all games were carried on the main MSG Network service within Zone 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2005-2006 NHL Telecast Schedule|url=https://www.nhl.com/sabres/news/2005-2006-nhl-telecast-schedule/c-436903|website=Buffalo Sabres official website|publisher=NHL, [[MLB Advanced Media]]|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buffalo Sabres 2005-2006 NHL Telecast Schedule|url=http://cdn.nhl.com/sabres/bc/images/buffalo_pages/pdf/SabresTVSchedule.pdf|publisher=Buffalo Sabres|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buffalo Sabres' regional television [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are among the highest in the league; in the 2015-16 season, despite the team's poor overall performance, fan enthusiasm over star prospect [[Jack Eichel]] helped the team achieve the highest average regional viewership of all NHL teams for the first time since 2008-09, with a 6.55 share.&lt;ref name="bn-msgwny"/&gt; National telecasts on [[NBC]] and [[NBCSN]] have also had notably high ratings in Buffalo.&lt;ref name="sbj-sabresratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabres end Penguins’ reign atop RSN ratings|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2016/04/18/Media/NHL-RSNs.aspx|website=Sports Business Journal|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bn-nbcratings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Buffalo is No. 1 market for hockey ratings despite 35 percent drop in year|url=http://talkintv.buffalonews.com/2015/04/14/buffalo-is-no-1-market-for-hockey-ratings-despite-40-percent-drop-in-year/|website=Buffalo News|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was speculated that Pegula Sports and Entertainment, which had recently bought the Sabres, [[Rochester Americans]], [[Buffalo Bandits]] and [[Buffalo Bills]], was planning to take advantage of the high viewership by establishing a team-owned regional sports network once the Sabres' existing television contract with MSG expired. The ''Buffalo News''{{'}}s Alan Pergament also acknowledged the impending end of the Sabres and Bills' radio contracts with [[WGR]] as a possibility that the group could, potentially, acquire a radio station to serve as a team-owned radio outlet if it is unable to renew its contract with [[Entercom]] (Entercom had purchased the Sabres' previous owned-and-operated station, 107.7 [[WLKK|WNSA]], in 2004, and merged its remaining programming onto WGR). Pegula eventually secured a contract extension with Entercom keeping the Bills and Sabres on WGR through the spring of 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2016/09/09/entercom-buffalo-to-keep-broadcasting-bills-sabres.html|last=Fink|first=James|work=Business First|date=September 9, 2016|accessdate=September 9, 2016|title=Entercom Buffalo to keep broadcasting Bills, Sabres on radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in regards to television, he felt that it was more likely for Pegula to partner with MSG to form a full-time, Buffalo-specific feed of MSG Network with additional local programming, rather than actually establishing a new, standalone outlet.&lt;ref name="bn-rsnmaybe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dbtb-empire2point0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are the Pegulas hiring for their own regional sports network?|url=http://www.diebytheblade.com/2016/6/15/11943104/are-pegulas-hiring-for-western-new-york-regional-sports-network|website=Die By The Blade (SB Nation)|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|width=200px|"Basically, what we have done is create our own platform, which is stronger because we already have the distribution on MSG, we have the benefit of MSG programming on there and the benefit of the platform of producing as much programming as we feel comfortable."|author = Mark Preisler&lt;ref name="bn-msgwny"/&gt;}}

On June 20, 2016, Pegula announced that it had entered into a joint venture with MSG to establish a new service known as MSG Western New York. The channel, a sub-feed of MSG Network took over the former MSG Zone 3/Sabres game only channel, replacing the parent channel within the Sabres existing television market—which was also, notably, expanded to include the entirety of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]].&lt;ref name="bn-12opinion"/&gt; The arrangement allows Pegula access to MSG's existing distribution and statewide programming, while allowing opt-outs for an expanded slate of local programming dedicated to the Bills and Sabres, which is produced and controlled by Pegula. MSG as part of the agreement pays $19 to $20 million per-year in rights fees to broadcast Sabres games and programming, as well as Buffalo Bills programming; it is nearly double the value of the previous Sabres deal. As with the previous deal, Pegula controls team programming on the network, including advertising sales and production (which is handled through PSE's production wing PicSix Creative), and receives all advertising revenue, while MSG collects the [[retransmission consent]] fee. Besides original programming and broadcasts exclusive to MSG WNY, the network also carries selected programming from the main MSG Network channel.&lt;ref name="bn-msgwny"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pergament|first=Alan|title=Wide-ranging deal will keep Sabres – and other Pegula Sports &amp; Entertainment content – on MSG|url=http://sabres.buffalonews.com/2016/06/20/wide-ranging-deal-will-keep-sabres-and-other-pegula-sports-entertainment-content-on-msg/|accessdate=June 22, 2016|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pegula's executive vice president of media and content Mark Preisler explained that the deal was an alternative to establishing a new regional sports network from scratch, as the company would be able to expand on its relationship with MSG as a long-standing partner by leveraging its infrastructure and distribution, rather than needing to invest in building a network and negotiating carriage with television providers.&lt;ref name="bn-msgwny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbf-wny"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fink|first=James|title=Pegula Sports and Entertainment, MSG Networks seal new, long-term deal|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/blog/morning_roundup/2016/06/pegula-sports-and-entertainment-msg-networks-seal.html|accessdate=June 22, 2016|work=Buffalo Business First|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first promos seen for the channel ran during a Bills preseason game against the [[Indianapolis Colts]] on August 13, 2016 promoting its Bills programming. The channel debuted on September 10, 2016 at 8:00pm with a Western New York cut in showing the 2016 debut of ''The Rex Ryan Show'' and a special behind the scenes feature called ''Rex and Rob Reunited'' at 8:30 and 9pm, the daily feed followed on October 3.&lt;ref&gt;http://talkintv.buffalonews.com/2016/09/07/bills-preseason-rating-drop-25-percent-in-a-year-dedes-and-wilcots-call-opener-at-baltimore/&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2017, news broke that [[James L. Dolan]], controlling owner of MSG, was exploring the sale of his regional sports networks, including his share of MSG Western New York.&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2017/04/03/msg-networks-is-looking-to-sell/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
The network carries team programming related to the Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bills; the former including all 70 regional Sabres games and the latter including local Bills shows formerly aired by [[WKBW-TV]]; preseason telecasts began to be simulcast with WKBW beginning in 2017. In addition, the channel simulcasts ''The Instigators'' (formerly known as ''Sabres Hockey Hotline'')&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhl.com/sabres/news/the-instigators-premieres-tuesday-on-wgr-550-and-msg/c-282245416&lt;/ref&gt; and ''One Bills Live'' (formerly known as ''The John Murphy Show'') from [[WGR]] radio as part of a five-hour weekday block, originating from studios (dubbed the ''One Buffalo studios'') at [[New Era Field]]; Murphy's program was moved from the evening to the afternoon and had a co-host added. As an aspect of the overall deal, PSE agreed in principle to extend its radio rights with WGR.

MSG Western New York added a package of five [[Rochester Americans]] contests beginning in December 2016, moving the team's television broadcasts to MSG WNY from the moribund [[Spectrum Sports (New York)|Time Warner Cable Sports Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amerks.com/article/AMERKS%20ANNOUNCE%202016-17%20TELEVISION%20SCHEDULE&lt;/ref&gt; On September 7, 2017, it was announced that the channel would begin airing select [[Monsignor Martin Athletic Association]] high school football games produced by Pegula as part of a multi-year deal, including a three-game showcase at New Era FIeld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buffalonews.com/2017/09/07/pegula-sports-entertainment-set-air-series-monsignor-martin-football-games/ Pegula Sports and Entertainment set to air series of Monsignor Martin football games]. ''The Buffalo News'' (September 7, 2017). Retrieved September 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The high school coverage moved exclusively online for 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.buffalobills.com/news/monsignor-martin-high-school-football-returns-to-new-era-field&lt;/ref&gt; Other programs will be added as the channel expands.&lt;ref name="bn-msgwny"/&gt; The remainder of MSG WNY's schedule consists of programming from the main [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]] schedule, such as [[New York Knicks]] basketball.&lt;ref name="bn-msgwny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bn-12opinion"/&gt; In turn, MSG also has rights to air the Pegula-produced original programming and game converge on its other networks.&lt;ref name="bn-msgwny"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bn-12opinion"&gt;Pergament, Alan (June 21, 2016).

In 2018, MSG-produced Bills preseason telecasts moved to the stations of [[Nexstar Media Group]] in all media markets outside Buffalo. As the Bills could not break their existing contract with WKBW in Buffalo, the rights in that city will not change until 2020, when Nexstar-owned [[WIVB-TV]] will begin carrying the games.&lt;ref&gt;https://buffalonews.com/2018/08/02/fred-jackson-to-join-bills-post-game-show-catalana-replaced-on-sidelines/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carriage==

===Cable television===
Both of the two primary cable providers in Western New York, [[Spectrum (cable service)|Spectrum]] (formerly [[Time Warner Cable]], which covers the vast majority of the state) and [[Atlantic Broadband]] (which covers a small portion of [[Cattaraugus County]]) have carried the network from its inception.

===DirecTV===
On August 10, 2016, the debut night of MSG Western New York it was revealed that [[DirecTV]] would not be running the network's full programming schedule.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/chellegz/status/774717839764848640?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; The Sabres noted that MSG made the programming available to DirecTV but the provider was not willing to carry it.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/BuffaloSabres/status/783311474345316353?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; This made MSG WNY a part-time channel on DirecTV with the provider continuing to air the channel as a game only service showing Sabres games only. For the [[2017 NFL season]], DirecTV began showing ''Bills All Acesss'' and irregularly showing the first runs of ''The Sean McDermott Show'' and ''Bills Tonight'' in addition to the Sabres games that the channel airs. A week later DirecTV began showing ''The Instigators'' and ''The John Murphy Show''. DirecTV happens to be the service that Pegula owned properties like 716 Food and Sport, a sports bar and grill in downtown Buffalo use.

===Dish Network===
MSG Western New York, like [[MSG (TV network)|MSG]] and [[MSG Plus]], is unavailable on [[Dish Network]]. As part of an ongoing feud with the family of [[Charles Dolan]] (owners of MSG), Dish has not carried any MSG network channel since the last agreement expired on October 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/article207853.ece|title=Dish NEtwork Drops MSG|date=2010-10-01|work=Buffalo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Over-the-top services===
[[FuboTV]] added the MSG networks for the fall 2017 season.&lt;ref name=broadcastingcable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/distribution/fubotv-adds-msg-networks/168908 |title=fuboTV Adds MSG Networks |website= broadcastingcable.com |date=2017-09-26 |accessdate=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitte''' is the first and most central [[boroughs and localities of Berlin|borough]] of [[Berlin]]. The borough consists of six sub-entities: [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte proper]], [[Gesundbrunnen (Berlin)|Gesundbrunnen]], [[Hansaviertel]], [[Moabit]], [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]] and [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]].

It is one of the two boroughs (beside [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]]) which comprises former [[West Berlin|West]] and [[East Berlin]] districts. Mitte encompasses Berlin's historic core and includes some of the most important tourist sites of Berlin like [[Museum Island]], the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|TV tower]], [[Checkpoint Charlie]], [[Brandenburg Gate]], [[Unter den Linden]], [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[Alexanderplatz]], the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] and [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]], most of which were in former East Berlin.

When Berliners refer to ''Mitte'' they usually mean the smaller locality rather than the larger borough.

==Geography==
[[File:Berliner Dom und Fernsehturm, 170117, ako.jpg|left|thumb|[[Berlin Cathedral]] and [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Television Tower]]]]
Mitte ([[German language|German]] for "middle", "centre") is located in the central part of Berlin along the [[Spree]] River. It borders on [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]] in the west, [[Reinickendorf]] in the north, [[Pankow]] in the east, [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]] in the southeast, and [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]] in the southwest.

In the middle of the Spree lies Museum Island (''Museumsinsel'') with its museums and [[Berlin Cathedral]] (''Berliner Dom''). The central square in Mitte is [[Alexanderplatz]] with the prominent [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower), Germany's highest building, and the large railway station with connections to many subway ([[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]), tramway ([[Berlin tram|Straßenbahn]]), city trains ([[S-Bahn Berlin|S-Bahn]]) and buses.

There are some important streets which connect Mitte with the other boroughs, e.g. the boulevard Unter den Linden which connects Alexanderplatz to the west with Brandenburg Gate and runs further as [[Straße des 17. Juni]] to the [[Berlin Victory Column|Victory Column]] and the centre of former West Berlin in [[Charlottenburg]], or [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] from [[Alexanderplatz]] to [[Friedrichshain]] and the eastern suburbs.

==History==
[[File:Berlin - Checkpoint Charlie 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Checkpoint Charlie]],1963]]
The former Mitte district had been established by the 1920 [[Greater Berlin Act]] and comprised large parts of the historic city around [[Alt-Berlin]] and [[Cölln]]. Brandenburg Gate was the western exit at the Berlin city boundary until 1861.

Between 1961 and 1990, Mitte was the central part of East Berlin, however at the same time it was surrounded by the [[Berlin Wall]] at its north, south and west. There were some border control points, the most famous of which was [[Checkpoint Charlie]] between [[Kreuzberg]] and Mitte, which was operated by the [[United States Army]] and its allies and was open to foreigners and diplomats.

Two other checkpoints were at Heinrich-Heine-Straße/[[Prinzenstraße (Berlin U-Bahn)|Prinzenstraße]] east of Checkpoint Charlie, open to citizens of West Germany and West Berlin and on [[Invalidenstraße]] in the north on the border with the West Berlin Tiergarten district (the present-day [[Moabit]] locality).

== Regierungsviertel (Government District) ==
The government district is located in the locality of [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]] around the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag Building.]] Most institutions of the German government have their seat at the Regierungsviertel 
* [[Bundestag]], the German parliament in the old [[Reichstag building|Reichstag Building]]
* [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]], seat of the [[President of Germany|Federal President]] 
* [[German Chancellery]]
* Offices of the [[Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin|Abgeordneten]], members of the parliament, in the ''Paul-Löbe-Haus'' and the ''Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus''
* [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]]

== Tiergarten Park ==
[[Tiergarten (park)|Großer Tiergarten]] is the name of the biggest urban park in Mitte, located in the [[Tiergarten, Berlin|same-named locality]]. The Tiergarten Park was established as a hunting ground in the 16th century by the Prussian kings. Today its enclosed by densely built-up areas by [[Hansaviertel]] and [[Moabit]] in the north, the Government District in the east and the [[City West]] and the Embassy Quarter in the southwest.

Many cultural monuments and memorials are located in the Tiergarten Park, like the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegessäule]], the [[Soviet War Memorial (Tiergarten)|Soviet War Memorial]] and a historic rose garden. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], the biggest victim group of the Nazi-Diktatorship, is located on the east side of the park, near the [[Brandenburg Gate]] and the place where once [[Reich Chancellery|Hitler's New Reich Chancellery]] was.

== Kulturforum ==
[[File:Philharmonie 1a.jpg|thumb|[[Berliner Philharmonie|Philharmonie Berlin]]]]
The Kulturforum was built in the 1950s and 1960s at the edge of [[West Berlin]], after most of the once unified city's cultural assets had been lost behind the [[Berlin Wall]]. The Kulturforum is characterized by its innovative modernist architecture; several buildings are distinguished by the organic designs of [[Hans Scharoun]], and the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] was designed by [[Mies van der Rohe]].

Among the cultural institutions housed in and around the Kulturforum are:
* [[Neue Nationalgalerie]]
* [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]]

==Demographics==
{{As of|2010}}, the district had a population of 322,919, of whom 144.000 (44.5%) had a migration background. In the former West Berlin areas of  Wedding, Gesundbrunnen and Moabit, foreigners and Germans of foreign origin compose nearly 70% of the population, while in Mitte proper the share of migrants is relatively low. The immigrant community is quite diverse, however, [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Sub-Saharan Africans|Africans]]{{who|date=April 2015}}, [[Eastern Europe]]ans {{who|date=April 2015}} and [[East Asia]]ns{{who|date=April 2015}} form the largest groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/Publikationen/Stat_Berichte/2011/SB_A1-5_hj02-10_BE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13959">The '''National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment''' (NOCSAE) is a [[non-profit organization]] operating in the [[United States]], whose mission is to reduce athletic injuries and death through standards and certification for [[athletic equipment]].  Schools and universities look to NOCSAE certification of equipment, particularly [[football helmet|helmets]], to protect players and reduce liability. NOCSAE data indicate a significant reduction in athlete fatalities and brain injuries when using NOCSAE-certified equipment.  NOCSAE has been criticized for stifling innovation, holding a conflict of interest, and not furthering true player safety.

==Creation and early years==
NOCSAE was organized in 1969 with the purpose of reducing death and injuries through the establishment of standards and certification for athletic equipment.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt;&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt; It does this through researching and testing equipment, developing new standards, and improving existing ones.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt; 

NOCSAE's commissioning came in the wake of the death of 32 players in [[professional football (gridiron)|organized football]] in 1968 and subsequent concerns over safety of athletic equipment.&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt; Based on its limited funding, NOCSAE has narrowed its efforts from protective athletic equipment in all sports toward helmets' effectiveness in reducing injury, particularly in football, [[lacrosse]], and [[baseball]].&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipsey /&gt;

==NOCSAE standards, adoption, and effects==
As a general matter, to be approved by NOCSAE, helmets must resist brain-injuring, concussive forces.&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt; Research from NOCSAE, in addition to targeting helmet safety standards, has also increased understanding of the mechanisms of head and neck injuries and the design and structure of helmets, headgear, and [[face mask (gridiron football)|face mask]]s.&lt;ref name=Lipsey /&gt;

NOCSAE standards are adopted, if at all, on a voluntary basis.  While a sport governing body may mandate that a piece of equipment be "NOCSAE approved", that is a rule or mandate of the governing body, not NOCSAE.&lt;ref name=Hillman /&gt;

By 1973, NOCSAE had finalized and published a standard testing criteria for football helmets.&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt;  The [[NCAA]] began advising its members to purchase helmets certified by NOCSAE beginning in 1975.&lt;ref name=Nelson /&gt; NOCSAE helmet standards were required in colleges in 1978 and in high schools in 1980.&lt;ref name=Hillman /&gt;

Stickers indicating NOCSAE certification are placed onto helmets.&lt;ref name=Amato /&gt;  Attorneys specializing in sports law advise schools and universities to purchase appropriate athletic equipment for the athletic activities offered that is of satisfactory quality, specifically football helmets that adhere to NOCSAE guidelines.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt;  School athletic staff are advised by experts to search for NOCSAE certification stickers, both as part of their athletic training education and day-to-day activities .&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt;&lt;ref name=Amato /&gt;  They are warned to do this, in particular, for liability reasons, as "serious legal reprecussions may occur if a helmet is issued to a student athletic " lacking an approval sticker.&lt;ref name=Eaves /&gt;

NOCSAE reports that by 1985, the number of head injury fatalities had fallen significantly, with zero deaths in 1990, the first season with no deaths since reporting began in 1931.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt; It also claims that the incidence of serious head injuries had fallen from 4.25 players per 100,000 in the late 1960s to 0.68 players per 100,000 in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt;

==Board membership==
The voting members of the NOCSAE board consists of representatives selected by their professional organizations, including:

* [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]
* [[American College of Sports Medicine]]
* [[American Medical Society for Sports Medicine]]
* [[Athletic Equipment Managers Association]]
* [[National Athletic Equipment Reconditioners Association]]
* [[National Athletic Trainers' Association]]
* [[Sporting and Fitness Industry Association]]
* [[American Football Coaches Association]]
* [[American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine]]
and a non-voting representative from each the National Collegiate Athletic Association and
the National Federation of State High School Associations.

==Criticisms==
Critics note that NOCSAE has "a close working relationship with" the sporting goods industry,&lt;ref name=Lipsey /&gt; and that because NOCSAE is funded by those few companies, it has "an inherent conflict of interest".&lt;ref name=Culverhouse /&gt; They also claim that NOCSAE is not effective at lessening concussions and improving safety.&lt;ref name=Culverhouse /&gt;  U.S. Senator [[Tom Udall]] of New Mexico requested that a federal agency, the [[Consumer Products Safety Commission]], assume an official role in helmet safety testing and certification, effectively displacing NOCSAE.&lt;ref name=Culverhouse /&gt;  

NOCSAE's certification standards have been criticized for authorizing helmet models that are "archaic or did not score well on specific impact tests."&lt;ref name=Borden /&gt;  In addition, NOCSAE's tests focus on preventing [[Catastrophic injury|catastrophic injuries]] like skull fractures, not concussions.&lt;ref name=Borden /&gt;  Observers note that such testing is equivalent to judging a car's safety based on its seat belts, with no consideration given to air bags.&lt;ref name=Borden /&gt;

The sole reliance of the [[NFL]] on NOCSAE certification, without considering the tested safety results and other data on helmet models, has been criticized by the players' union.&lt;ref name=Borden /&gt;

Critics note that while NOCSAE standards call for equipment to be reconditioned, where possible, and recertified every year,&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt; a school may keep its helmets as NOCSAE-certified simply by never submitting them for re-certification.&lt;ref name=Nowinski /&gt;

The inflexible nature of NOCSAE guidelines, stemming from the hesitance of helmet manufacturers to take any risks that could lead to lawsuits,&lt;ref name=Lipsey /&gt; leads some to argue that innovative helmet designs may be underdeveloped.&lt;ref name=Nowinski /&gt;

==Background==
On 20 October 2017, an anonymous [[Reddit]] user hinted at the existence of the Paradise Papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|url=https://qz.com/1120925/paradise-papers-reddit-user-hinted-at-data-leak-16-days-before-news-broke|title=A Reddit user hinted at Paradise Papers 16 days before they leaked|date=6 November 2017|work=Quartz|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106105209/https://qz.com/1120925/paradise-papers-reddit-user-hinted-at-data-leak-16-days-before-news-broke|archivedate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] (ICIJ) approached the [[Offshore financial centre|offshore]] law firm [[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]] with allegations of wrongdoing. Appleby said that some of its data had been stolen in a [[cyberattack]] the previous year, and denied the ICIJ's allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodgson|first=Camilla |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/financial-secrets-of-super-rich-stolen-offshore-appleby-2017-10|title=Panama Papers 2?

Appleby stated the firm "was not the subject of a leak but of a serious criminal act" and that "this was an illegal computer hack". "Our systems were accessed by an intruder who deployed the tactics of a professional hacker", the company said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.applebyglobal.com/media-statements/appleby-reaction-to-media-coverage.aspx|title=Appleby reaction to media coverage|publisher=Appleby|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=8 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107153505/https://www.applebyglobal.com/media-statements/appleby-reaction-to-media-coverage.aspx|archivedate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2017/11/07/data-leak-was-criminal-act|title=Data leak was 'criminal act' |work=Jersey Evening Post|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=10 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111042447/https://jerseyeveningpost.com/news/2017/11/07/data-leak-was-criminal-act|archivedate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents were acquired by the German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', which had also obtained the [[Panama Papers]] in 2016. According to the [[BBC]], the name "Paradise Papers" reflects "the idyllic profiles of many of the offshore jurisdictions whose workings are unveiled", so-called [[tax haven]]s, or "tax paradises".&lt;ref name="BBC need to know" /&gt;

The data breach comprises some 13.4&amp;nbsp;million documents—totaling about 1.4 terabytes—from two offshore service providers, Appleby and [[Asiaciti Trust]], and from the company registers of 19 tax havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paradise Papers|url=https://projekte.sueddeutsche.de/paradisepapers/wirtschaft/answers-to-pressing-questions-about-the-leak-e574659|work=Süddeutsche Zeitung|access-date=6 November 2017|date=5 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106132311/https://projekte.sueddeutsche.de/paradisepapers/wirtschaft/answers-to-pressing-questions-about-the-leak-e574659|archivedate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' journalists contacted the ICIJ, which has been investigating the documents with 100 media partners.

===Apple===
{{main|Leprechaun economics}}
A great deal of the company's [[intangible property]] was exposed around the time of an internal [[Apple Inc.]] reorganization of three [[Ireland|Irish]] subsidiaries. The company's 2015 [[gross domestic product]] showed a 26% increase, and close to $270&amp;nbsp;billion of [[intangible asset]]s suddenly appeared in Ireland as the year began – more than the entire value of all residential property in Ireland. This may indicate that Apple took advantage of a tax incentive known as a capital allowance, which gives Irish companies generous tax breaks for buying intangible property – essentially intellectual property like patents. In other words, Apple (some suggest) transferred them to a subsidiary located in Ireland for the tax incentives, and didn't have to pay any tax on the transaction in Bermuda either, on the value it declared on the property when it sold them to itself.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Following a 2013 US Senate investigation, which featured testimony by CEO [[Tim Cook]], Ireland announced that henceforth Irish companies would be required to declare [[tax residency]] somewhere in the world. Apple had been paying a lower rate of corporate taxes in Ireland in a so-called sweetheart deal. This attracted the attention of EU regulators as many multinationals were doing the same thing. As the tax break in the Netherlands came to a scheduled end, Apple's law firm, Baker McKenzie, researched island tax havens, asking Appleby officials in numerous jurisdictions to confirm "that an Irish company can conduct management activities ... without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction." Two of the subsidiaries moved to [[Jersey]] and took intellectual property with them{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The third is receiving tax breaks in Ireland for buying Apple IP from another Apple subsidiary{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) issued a Statement re Apple on 7 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jerseyfsc.org/media/1596/2017-11-07_jfsc_statement_re_apple.pdf|title=Jersey Financial Services Commission Statement re Apple|publisher=JFSC|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JFSC confirmed that the two Apple subsidiaries referred to by the media are not Jersey-registered companies and their understanding is that Apple funds relating to these entities have not been remitted to or held in the Island.

The JFSC states that it has not seen any of the documentation that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) claims to hold following the Appleby data breach. If the ICIJ possesses data of a criminal or regulatory nature which relates to business activities in Jersey then the JFSC requested that this information is shared with them and, if there is any evidence of regulatory wrongdoing, then they would investigate and take action if appropriate.

The Government of Jersey (States of Jersey) also issued a statement of similar effect on 7 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.je/News/2017/Pages/ApplebyStatement.aspx|title=Jersey Government Appleby Data Breach Statement|publisher=States of Jersey|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is of further note that the jurisdiction of Jersey has recently been independently assessed as fully compliant with international regulatory guidelines on tax transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/countries/jersey/global-forum-on-transparency-and-exchange-of-information-for-tax-purposes-jersey-2017-second-round-9789264283824-en.htm|title=OECD Jersey Report 2017|publisher=OECD|date=17 November 2017|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU, under the leadership of [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], threatened to sue Ireland over its tax deals, although Juncker himself had approved similar tax deals in his own country, [[Luxembourg]]. Apple paid all of its taxes in Ireland as required by that country so Ireland is appealing the EU decision. HP, Nike, Microsoft and others use the same tax arrangements in Ireland, Luxembourg and other countries,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} but Apple is frequently cited as a media example.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of public corporations by market capitalization#2017]]&lt;/ref&gt; Irish companies are required to pay taxes in Ireland, but if they convince authorities {{Which|date=February 2018}} that they are "managed and controlled" from abroad, the companies may win an exemption.

=== Avianca ===
[[Germán Efromovich]], founder of [[Synergy Group]], is linked to an offshore conglomerate used for the aerocommercial [[holding business]] with ramifications in Bermuda, Panama, and Cyprus. Efromovich used a Panamanian offshore that hid more than 20 firms located in tax havens. The conglomerate was used by Synergy Group's subsidiary [[Avianca Holdings]] in the purchase of MacAir Jet, now [[Avianca Argentina]], aircraft company owned by Macri Group, for an amount of $10&amp;nbsp;million. Allowing Avianca to make headway in the [[low-cost carrier]] business in Argentina. The Argentine government accepted this offshores as a financial [[guarantee]] to assign air routes to Avianca. The whole operation of assigning air routes is investigated by the Argentine federal justice system in a case called "Avianca" in which the [[President of Argentina]] [[Mauricio Macri]] and other officials were imputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=10 November 2017|last1=Delfino|first1=Emilia|last2=Crucianelli|first2=Sandra|last3=Fitz Patrick|first3=Mariel|last4=Brom|first4=Ricardo|last5=Jastreblansky|first5=Maia|last6=Ruiz|first6=Iván|last7=Alconada Mon|first7=Hugo|title=Paradise Papers – El entramado de más de 20 offshores detrás del desembarco de Avianca|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-el-entramado-de-mas-de-20-offshores-detras-del-desembarco-de-avianca.phtml|accessdate=10 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110143321/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-el-entramado-de-mas-de-20-offshores-detras-del-desembarco-de-avianca.phtml|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Kremlin-owned firm]], [[VTB Bank]], put $191&amp;nbsp;million into DST Global, an investment firm part of [[Mail.ru]] Group and founded by Russian billionaire [[Yuri Milner]], which used it to buy a large share of [[Twitter]] in 2011. A subsidiary of the Kremlin-controlled [[Gazprom]] funded an investment company that partnered with DST Global to buy shares in [[Facebook]], reaping millions when the social media giant went public in 2012. Twitter similarly went public in 2013. The US government sanctioned VTB in 2014 because of the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian military intervention in Crimea]], but DST Global had by then sold its stake in Twitter. Four days after the Facebook [[IPO]], a DST Global subsidiary sold more than 27&amp;nbsp;million shares of Facebook for approximately $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=FBTwit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/kremlin-owned-firms-linked-major-twitter-facebook-investments-icij/|title=Kremlin-Owned Firms Linked To Major Investments In Twitter And Facebook: The Russian government quietly held a financial interest in U.S. social media|author=Spencer Woodman|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106011238/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/kremlin-owned-firms-linked-major-twitter-facebook-investments-icij/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glencore ===
&lt;!-- some of this should go to the main page with an even more distilled version here. This is my best first pass at summarizing the several news stories though --&gt;
In 2009, [[Glencore]], an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company, loaned $45&amp;nbsp;million to Israeli billionaire [[Dan Gertler]] in exchange for his help with officials of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in negotiations over a [[joint venture]] with state-owned [[Gécamines]] at the [[Katanga Mining|Katanga copper mine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gertler, Dan (DGI Group): Rough and Polished: Information and Analytics on Diamond and Jewellery Markets|date=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ben Doherty|author2=Oliver Zihlmann|publisher=Guardian|date=5 November 2017|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/the-inside-story-of-glencore-hidden-dealings-in-drc|title=The inside story of Glencore's hidden dealings in the DRC|accessdate=8 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106060148/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/the-inside-story-of-glencore-hidden-dealings-in-drc|archivedate=6 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current DRC president, [[Joseph Kabila]], the son of [[Laurent Kabila]], who sold Congolese diamond rights to Gertler, then used the proceeds to take power in a ''[[coup d'état|coup]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

One of the Katanga board members was Glencore major shareholder [[Telis Mistakidis]], a former employee whose [[stock options]] made him a billionaire in the IPO. Glencore, which had effectively taken over Katanga, agreed to vote for the joint venture. The loan document specifically provided that repayment would be owed if agreement was not reached within three months. Gertler and Glencore each have denied wrongdoing. Appleby had worked for Glencore and its founder [[Marc Rich]] on major projects in the past, even after his indictment in 1983.&lt;ref name=glencore&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|title=Revealed: Glencore's secret loan to secure DRC mining rights|author1=Ben Doherty|author2=Oliver Zihlmann|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/revealed-glencore-secret-loan-drc-mining-rights-paradise-papers|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106023739/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/revealed-glencore-secret-loan-drc-mining-rights-paradise-papers|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=room&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/room-of-secrets-reveals-mysteries-of-glencore/|author1=Bastian Obermayer|author2=Edouard Perrin|author3=Frederik Obermaier|author4=Oliver Zihlmann|author5=Petra Blum|author6=Will Fitzgibbon|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|title=Room Of Secrets Reveals Glencore's Mysteries: Law firm's internal files reveal oil, mineral and grain trader Glencore signed secret deals and loaned millions to a high-risk business partner.|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106000453/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/room-of-secrets-reveals-mysteries-of-glencore/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich was indicted in the United States on federal charges of [[tax evasion]] and making controversial oil deals with Iran during the [[Iran hostage crisis]].&lt;ref name="KingofOil"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Daniel Ammann|Ammann, Daniel]]|title=[[The King of Oil: The Secret Lives of Marc Rich]]|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York|year=2009|isbn=0-312-57074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bill Clinton pardon controversy|controversial presidential pardon]] from [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on 20 January 2001, Clinton's last day in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/may/13/features.magazine37 |title=Profile: Marc Rich &amp;#124; From the Observer &amp;#124; The Observer |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=30 October 2012 |first=Mark |last=Honigsbaum |date=13 May 2001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204000206/http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/may/13/features.magazine37 |archivedate=4 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate ICIJ project found that tax auditors in [[Burkina Faso]] accused a Glencore subsidiary of deducting from its taxes "fictitious" payments to other Glencore subsidiaries, and of selling the zinc from its mine (to another Glencore compary) in unrefined form to minimize its revenue, which it publicly said in 2015 had not recovered from a 2017 downturn. Its CEO told shareholders before this that it expected a spike in demand, which did materialize. The mine is owned by Nantou Mining SA, which is owned by Merope Inc, a Bermuda shell company set up by Appleby with directors provided by the firm. Glencore sold Merope in April 2017 but before that it was 100% owned by Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Ltd, which was, according to a document from the Paradise Papers leaks, 100% owned by Glencore Group Funding Ltd of the [[United Arab Emirates]], an entity in turn 100% owned by Swiss firm Glencore International AG, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Glencore plc, registered in [[Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Burk&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/development-dreams-stand-still-mining-money-moves-offshore/|title=Development Dreams Stand Still While Mining Money Moves Offshore|author=Will Fitzgibbon|date=8 November 2017|accessdate=12 November 2017|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061248/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/development-dreams-stand-still-mining-money-moves-offshore/|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents were also discovered discussing Glencore's desire to keep its substantial stake in SwissMarine a secret, and that although the subsidiary's annual report showed [[revenues]] of $1.9 billion in 2014, Glencore does not mention it in its disclosures to the [[London Stock Exchange]] or any other public filing because, it said, it did not consider this a significant investment.&lt;ref name=Swiss&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org//paradise-papers/glencores-hush-hush-swissmarine-fleet/|title=The Ships Glencore Wanted To Keep 'Hush Hush'|publisher=ICIJ|date=9 November 2017|accessdate=12 November 2017|author=Will Fitzgibbon}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian branch of Glencore has been demonstrated to have carried out some $25&amp;nbsp;billion in [[Interest rate swap|cross-currency interest rate swaps]], complex financial instruments the [[Australian Taxation Office]] suspects of being used to avoid paying taxes in Australia.&lt;ref name=GlencoreATO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/glencore-australian-arm-moved-billions-through-bermuda|title=Glencore's Australian Arm moved Billions Through Bermuda: Paradise Papers reveal use of cross-currency interest rate swaps, which are under investigation by the tax office|author=Ben Doherty|publisher=The Guardian|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106024102/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/glencore-australian-arm-moved-billions-through-bermuda|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nike ===
Appleby documents detail how Nike boosted its after-tax profits by, among other maneuvers, transferring ownership of its Swoosh [[trademark]] to a Bermudian subsidiary, Nike International Ltd. This transfer allowed the [[subsidiary]] to charge [[royalties]] to its European headquarters in [[Hilversum]], [[Netherlands]], effectively converting taxable company [[profit (accounting)|profits]] to an account payable in tax-free Bermuda.&lt;ref name=Nike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|title=How NikeStays One Step Ahead of the Regulators: When One Tax Loophole Closes, Another Opens|author=Simon Bowers|publisher=ICIJ|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106011937/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the subsidiary was effectively run by executives at Nike's main offices in [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], Oregon – to the point where a duplicate of the Bermudian company's seal was needed – for tax purposes the subsidiary was treated as based in Bermuda. Its profits were not declared in Europe and came to light only because of a mostly unrelated case in [[US Tax Court]], where papers filed by Nike briefly mention royalties in 2010, 2011 and 2012 totaling $3.86&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Nike /&gt; Under an arrangement with Dutch authorities, the tax break was to expire in 2014, so another reorganization transferred the intellectual property from the Bermudian company to a Dutch ''commanditaire vennootschap'' or limited partnership, Nike Innovate CV.

Dutch law treats income earned by a CV as if it had been earned by the principals, who owe no tax in the Netherlands if they do not reside there. One in six dollars of foreign [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] earned by US multinationals was earned, at least on paper, through a Dutch CV subsidiary. Companies with similar structures include [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], [[NetApp]] and [[Uber (company)|Uber]].&lt;ref name=Nike /&gt;

=== Odebrecht ===
Appleby managed 17 offshore companies for [[Odebrecht]], a Brazilian conglomerate, and at least one of them was used as a vehicle for paying bribes in the [[Operation Car Wash]]. Some of these offshore companies are publicly known to operate for Odebrecht in Africa and be involved in bribes. Among those involved in the operation who also are named in the papers are [[Marcelo Odebrecht]], Brazilian businessman and former Odebrecht' CEO, his father Emílio Odebrecht and his brother Maurício Odebrecht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delfino|first1=Emilia|title=Paradise Papers: Salen a la luz 17 offshore de Odebrecht y al menos una se usó para sobornos|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-salen-a-la-luz-17-offshore-de-odebrecht-y-al-menos-una-se-uso-para-sobornos.phtml|accessdate=9 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|date=8 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108203827/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-salen-a-la-luz-17-offshore-de-odebrecht-y-al-menos-una-se-uso-para-sobornos.phtml|archivedate=8 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PokerStars ===
Appleby and various banks in the [[Isle of Man]], including [[Conister Bank]] which is owned by [[Arron Banks]] and [[Jim Mellon]], had business with [[PokerStars]] and its founders, [[Mark Scheinberg]] and his father [[Isai Scheinberg]], until it was sold for $4.9&amp;nbsp;billion in 2014 to [[The Stars Group]], formerly known as Amaya.

The papers show that the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], a private estate of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], held investments in two [[offshore financial centre]]s, the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Bermuda]]. Both are [[British Overseas Territories]] of which she is monarch, and nominally appoints governors. Britain handles foreign policy for both islands to a large extent, but Bermuda has been self-governing since 1620. The Duchy's investments included [[First Quench Retailing]] off-licences and [[rent-to-own]] retailer [[BrightHouse (retailer)|BrightHouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osborne|first1=Hilary|title=Revealed: Queen's private estate invested millions of pounds offshore|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/revealed-queen-private-estate-invested-offshore-paradise-papers|publisher=''The Guardian''|access-date=5 November 2017|date=5 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105190200/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/revealed-queen-private-estate-invested-offshore-paradise-papers|archivedate=5 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour Party Leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] posited whether the Queen should apologize, saying anyone with money offshore for tax avoidance should "not just apologise for it, [but] recognise what it does to our society". A spokesman for the Duchy said that all of their investments are audited and legitimate and that the Queen voluntarily pays taxes on income she receives from Duchy investments.&lt;ref name=beeb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41883472|publisher=BBC|title=Paradise Papers: Queen should apologise, suggests Corbyn|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107042716/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41883472|archivedate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appleby has taken legal action against ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the ''[[BBC]]'' and this is widely seen as an attack on [[press freedom]].

He told Argentine members of the ICIJ team that "it was an investment fund for friends and family."&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt; The funds, opened in 2009 and with over $100&amp;nbsp;million under management, remained under Caputo's management until December 2015, when Macri named him Finance Secretary, a post upgraded to Finance Minister this January.&lt;ref name=perfil /&gt;

Argentine Energy Minister [[Juan José Aranguren]] managed two offshore companies, Shell Western Supply and Trading Limited and Sol Antilles y Guianas Limited, both subsidiaries of [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. One is the main bidder for the purchase of diesel oil by the current government through the state owned CAMMESA (Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico).&lt;ref name="perfil1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aranguren: su paso por una offshore de Shell a la que el Estado le compró gasoil por US$ 150 M|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-aranguren-su-paso-por-una-offshore-de-shell-a-la-que-el-estado-le-compro-gasoil-por-us-150-m.phtml|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|date=7 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107155244/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-aranguren-su-paso-por-una-offshore-de-shell-a-la-que-el-estado-le-compro-gasoil-por-us-150-m.phtml|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the papers, Argentine hotelier and real estate developer [[Alan Faena]] was director and CEO of half a dozen companies in the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[British Virgin Islands]]. Faena also appears with bank accounts in [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Isle of Man]], linked to different hotels and real estate projects in [[Puerto Madero]]. In the offshore firms he was associated with different investors such as Soviet-born British-American businessman [[Leonard Blavatnik]]; American billionaire [[J. Christopher Burch]] and his brother Robert Burch; American business and media executive [[John Augustine Hearst]]; and French designer [[Philippe Starck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alan Faena, otro argentino en Paradise Papers|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/alan-faena-otro-argentino-en-paradise-papers-firmas-offshore-y-cuentas-en-suiza-y-luxemburgo.phtml|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|date=7 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107213019/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/alan-faena-otro-argentino-en-paradise-papers-firmas-offshore-y-cuentas-en-suiza-y-luxemburgo.phtml|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maggi told Brazilian outlet ''Poder360'' that he was not a direct beneficiary of the company and he had never received money from it.

[[Henrique Meirelles|Henrique de Campos Meirelles]], the current Brazilian Minister of Finance, told ''[[Poder360]]'' that he does not report income from his Sabedoria Foundation because it was set up to perform charitable functions after his death and therefore he receives no income from it.&lt;ref name=explore /&gt;

President of [[Colombia]] (2010–2018) [[Juan Manuel Santos]] is mentioned in the investigation. He was part of two offshore societies.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2017/11/05/59ff586f22601dea7f8b460c.html Juan Manuel Santos, el yerno de Trump y la reina Isabel II, implicados en los Paradise Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108023135/http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2017/11/05/59ff586f22601dea7f8b460c.html |date=8 November 2017 }}".

== Public reaction ==
In the United Kingdom, the public reaction to the Paradise Papers has been relatively muted compared to similar leaks in the past, such as the [[Panama Papers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/10/protest-paradise-papers-micah-white |title=Why aren't the streets full of protest about the Paradise Papers? |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |author=Micah White |date=10 November 2017 |accessdate=10 November 2017 |quote=The street-level response to the Paradise Papers, the mighty follow-up punch to last year's Panama Papers, has been curiously tepid. This is probably not what many activists, and the 100 media organizations involved in the leak, expected to happen. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110124851/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/10/protest-paradise-papers-micah-white |archivedate=10 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible reasons include the absence of overt illegality in the information; most media sources are careful to point out that the schemes in the Paradise Papers are generally lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/bill-jamieson-is-it-so-bad-to-avoid-tax-within-the-law-1-4608429 |title=Bill Jamieson: is it so bad to avoid tax within the law? |publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]'' |author=Bill Jamieson |date=9 November 2017 |accessdate=10 November 2017 |quote=Arguably most puzzling of all was the exact nature of the wrong doing. Both the Paradise Papers website and the BBC Panorama documentary ... repeatedly stressed that no laws had been broken and that UK tax due had been paid. Indeed, as the BBC documentary made clear, "the vast majority of the transactions involve no legal wrongdoing". |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109111745/http://www.scotsman.com/news/bill-jamieson-is-it-so-bad-to-avoid-tax-within-the-law-1-4608429 |archivedate=9 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement on behalf of Queen Elizabeth confirmed that the Royal Estate paid full UK tax on her offshore investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41878305|title=Paradise Papers: Queen's private estate invested £10m in offshore funds|publisher=BBC News|author=|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=10 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106011244/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41878305|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other public comments by notable popular public figures who appeared in the Papers may also play a part; Bono stated "I've been assured by those running the company that it is fully tax compliant, but if that is not the case, I want to know as much as the tax office does, and so I also welcome the audit they have said they will undertake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bono-paradise-papers-u2-tax-offshore-investment-guernsey-malta-shopping-mall-statement-latest-a8044541.html |title=Paradise Papers: Bono says he welcomes investigation into offshore investment |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |author=Roisin O'Connor |date=9 November 2017 |accessdate=10 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108213035/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bono-paradise-papers-u2-tax-offshore-investment-guernsey-malta-shopping-mall-statement-latest-a8044541.html |archivedate=8 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Peat has suggested that much of the media has ignored the story of the Paradise Papers because those media organisations are owned by individuals implicated in the papers, such as ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' owners [[Barclay brothers|David and Frederick Barclay]], ''[[Daily Mail]]'' owner [[Jonathan Harmsworth]], and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'' owner [[Rupert Murdoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peat |first=Jack |date=7 November 2017 |title=This is why there's been so little media coverage of the Paradise Papers |url=https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/theres-little-media-coverage-paradise-papers/07/11/ |work=The London Economic |access-date=12 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113113109/https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/theres-little-media-coverage-paradise-papers/07/11/ |archivedate=13 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the leak, more than 30 [[Members of the European Parliament]] issued an open letter criticizing the British government for failing to take action against the offshore tax industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborne|first1=Hilary|last2=MacAskill|first2=Ewen|title=Britain criticised by MEPs for failing to take action on tax havens|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/10/britain-criticised-meps-action-tax-havens-paradise-papers|accessdate=10 November 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110143004/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/10/britain-criticised-meps-action-tax-havens-paradise-papers|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gavin St Pier]], an elected Deputy of the tax haven [[Guernsey]], stated that the "coverage was part of a well-orchestrated, ongoing campaign".&lt;ref name=GStP&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/38e99534-c48e-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675 |title=Paradise Papers shake Britain's offshore tax havens |publisher=''Financial Times'' |author=Vanessa Houlder |date=8 November 2017 |accessdate=8 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109172213/https://www.ft.com/content/38e99534-c48e-11e7-a1d2-6786f39ef675 |archivedate=9 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also averred that despite having the information since 2016, the timing of the release was deliberately delayed to coincide with the meeting of EU Finance Ministers ahead of the proposed discussion of a tax haven blacklist.&lt;ref name=GStP /&gt;

Commenting on the Paradise Papers leak, United States Senator and 2016 presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] warned of "rapid movement toward international oligarchy", saying, "The Paradise Papers shows how these billionaires and multinational corporations get richer by hiding their wealth and profits and avoid paying their fair share of taxes."&lt;ref name=Sanders&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/06/bernie-sanders-paradise-papers-leak-international-oligarchy|title=Bernie Sanders warns of 'international oligarchy' after Paradise Papers leak|publisher=''The Guardian''|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106190738/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/06/bernie-sanders-paradise-papers-leak-international-oligarchy|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] leader in the US Senate, [[Chuck Schumer]], and the ranking Democratic member of the Senate finance committee, [[Ron Wyden]], issued a joint statement accusing Republicans of "pushing a reform of the tax code that fails to close egregious loopholes revealed by the leaks."&lt;ref name=Sanders /&gt;

==Litigation==
On 18 December 2017 it was reported that Appleby had issued legal proceedings against the BBC and ''The Guardian'' for [[Breach of confidence in English law|breach of confidence]].  The BBC and ''The Guardian'' said they would "vigorously" defend the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42403700|title=BBC and Guardian sued over Paradise Papers leaks|publisher=BBC News|date=18 December 2017|accessdate=24 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221174814/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42403700|archivedate=21 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appleby released a media statement to explain the necessity to seek legal action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.applebyglobal.com/media-statements/appleby-takes-legal-action.aspx|title=Appleby Media Statement|publisher=States of Jersey|date=20 December 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided subsequent update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.applebyglobal.com/media-statements/why-appleby-is-taking-legal-action-against-the-guardian-and-the-bbc.aspx|title=Appleby Media Statement|publisher=States of Jersey|date=26 January 2018|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' and the BBC settled the dispute with Appleby in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tobitt |first=Charlotte |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/guardian-and-bbc-settle-paradise-papers-dispute-with-offshore-law-firm-appleby/ |title=Guardian and BBC settle Paradise Papers dispute with offshore law firm Appleby |work=Press Gazette |date=22 May 2018 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, Swiss-based multinational [[Glencore]] lodged a writ with the Australian High Court to prevent the use of Paradise Papers documents by the Australian Taxation Office in any legal action against the miner. Glencore asserted that the documents in question are subject to legal professional privilege. Glencore’s writ has four plaintiffs: Glencore International AG (an intermediate holding company resident in Switzerland), Glencore Investment Pty Ltd (a company incorporated in Australia), Glencore Australia Holdings Pty Ltd (a company incorporated in Australia) and Glencore Investment Holdings Australia Ltd (a company incorporated in Bermuda).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/finance/news/glencore-seeks-injunction-against-tax-commissioner-to-prevent-use-of-paradise-papers/ar-BBNRXEJ|title=Glencore seeks injunction against tax commissioner to prevent use of Paradise Papers|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 October 2018|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Partner relationship management (PRM)''' is a system of methodologies, strategies, [[software]], and [[web-based]] capabilities that help a [[vendor]] to manage [[Business partner|partner relationships]]. The general purpose of PRM is to enable vendors to better manage their partners through the introduction of reliable systems, processes and procedures for interacting with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svcawards.com/files/Forrester%20Wave%20PRM%20Q4%202013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/sales-focused-partner-relationship-management-prm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/partner-relationship-management&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based PRM systems typically include a [[Content Management System]], a partner and customer contact database, and the notion of a partner portal which allows partners to log in and interact with a [[vendor]]'s sales opportunity database and obtain product, pricing, and training information. There are a number of solution providers who offer PRM software companies who rely heavily on a PRM solution to stay relevant in their respective industries.

Vendors who implement a PRM solution are typically motivated by a need to reduce the financial overhead and establish new partnerships to drive channel revenue and scale.  Partners may also be integrators or managed service providers.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.compubase.net/Partners-Resellers-ISVs-MSPs-Integrators-lists-for-business_a272.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] systems, which are tailored toward getting an end customer to purchase from you, a PRM system is focused on getting a partner to sell on your behalf.  As a result, they commonly offer web-based self-service tools, information, and resources to partner resellers. Tools often include:
* [[Market development funds|MDF]] Request Programs
* Training, [[Certification]], and [[Accreditation]] Automation
* [[Qualified prospect|Deal]] Registration Programs
* Indirect [[Sales process|Sales Pipeline]] Reporting
* Joint [[Business Plan]]ning
* [[Bounty (reward)|Reward]] and [[Loyalty Program]]s
* [[Digital library|Content Library]]

==Trends==

Gartner reports that PRM solutions have mainly been adopted by companies in the hardware technology, software technology, telecommunication, and manufacturing industries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRM application market has expanded significantly in the last 10 years, with vendors offering improved end-to-end and point solutions for the management of channel sales partners.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Plaza Theatre''' is a historic building in [[El Paso, Texas]] built in 1930. The theater stands as one of the city's most well-known landmarks,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Famous Places in El Paso History: A Bilingual Picture and Activity Book|last = Natividad|first = Maria Almeida|publisher = Galeria del Sol|year = 2015|isbn = 9780986184307|location = El Paso, Texas|pages = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains operational today. The theatre is a [[National Register of Historic Places|National Historic Building of Significance]] featuring the 2,050-seat Kendall Kidd Performance Hall, and the smaller 200-seat Philanthropy Theatre.  It hosts [[Broadway theatre|Broadway productions]], musical concerts, individual performers and the annual Plaza Classic Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpasolive.com/venues/plaza_theatre|title=Plaza Theatre|last=|first=|date=August 17, 2018|website=El Paso Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the Plaza Theatre being built, there had been a large produce warehouse, belonging to Bernard and Ben Schuster, which occupied the location on Pioneer Plaza.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = El Paso: Guided Through Time|last = Metz|first = Leon|publisher = Mangan Books|year = 1999|isbn = 9780930208370|location = El Paso, Texas|pages = 56–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1927, the owner of the principal El Paso theaters, Louis L. Dent, bought the property on Pioneer Plaza with the stated intention of doing something good for the city of El Paso. Upon purchase of the property, he told the [[El Paso Times]], "El Paso has been good to me, and I am going to put something everybody will proud of."

In 1929, construction of the [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival style]] Plaza Theater began. It was designed by the prolific Dallas architect W. Scott Dunne, who is credited with more than 30 theaters in Texas and Oklahoma. Today the Plaza is recognized as his surviving masterpiece. H. Ponsford &amp; Sons built the theater,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = El Paso Chronicles: A Record of Historical Events in El Paso, Texas|last = Metz|first = Leon|publisher = Mangan Books|year = 1993|isbn = 9780930208325|location = El Paso, Texas|pages = 219–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and constructed by C.A. Goetting Construction Company. The Plaza was designed as a modern film house in a Spanish Colonial revival style with the flexibility of presenting stage shows. Construction was completed in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = El Paso: A Borderlands History|last = Timmons|first = W.H.|publisher = Texas Western Press|year = 1990|isbn = 0874042070|location = El Paso, Texas|pages = 236–237, 274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wurlitzer|Wurlitzer Company]] installed a $60,000 [[pipe organ]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was advertised as the "largest theater of its kind between [[Dallas]] and [[Los Angeles]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.thc.state.tx.us/public/upload/publications/medallion-march-april-2011.pdf|title = Escape to El Paso|last = |first = |date = March 2011|journal = The Medallion|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 14 August 2015|page = 10|publisher = Texas Historical Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opening night was on September 12, 1930 with the movie "Follow Through"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to a capacity crowd of 2,410.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although several theaters existed in downtown El Paso at the time the Plaza Theatre opened, its size, elaborate decor, and technical innovations made it stand out. It was advertised as the largest theater of its kind between [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The Plaza has been a [[vaudeville]] or burlesque house as well as also showing movies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The theater featured an "atmospheric" ceiling complete with twinkling stars which were astronomically correct stars and projections of lazily floating clouds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was the first public theater in the [[United States]] with [[air conditioning]].

In 1933, Interstate Theaters purchased the Plaza Theatre.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On February 10, 1934, the Plaza's very first stage drama, ''[[Richelieu (play)|Richelieu]]'', was performed. The cast included then famous Walter Hampton, [[Dallas Anderson (actor)|Dallas Anderson]], [[John Davenport (actor)|John Davenport]] and Mable More. In 1939, the theater showed ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'' in two different showings because of [[Jim Crow laws]] in El Paso.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The first showing was whites only, but a [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights]] activist, [[Betty Mary Goetting]], prevailed on the Plaza Theatre to show a midnight screening which [[African American]]s could attend.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The midnight show of ''Gone With the Wind'' was reported to be "packed."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1949, the Plaza hosted the world premier of the film "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041332/ El Paso]," which drew a capacity and star-studded crowd, and also showed [[Thomas C. Lea, III|Tom Lea's]] "The Brave Bulls."

===Decline===
By the 1950s, two major influences factored into a slow decline in the Plaza Theatre's patronage. The advent of [[television]] and the rise of [[Suburb|suburban neighborhoods]] located farther and farther away from downtown served as major challenges to the Plaza Theatre in addition to other downtown establishments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the same time, a new source of competition arose with the advent of [[drive-in theater]]s in the late 1940s.

By the early 1970s, the theater had fallen into disrepair, and was sold. Many of its impressive amenities, including furnishings, artwork, and the Mighty Wurlitzer Organ were auctioned off. Only by the acquisition of the theater by the local Dipp Family in 1973 was the Plaza saved from demolition at that time.

The Plaza closed on May 31, 1974.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1985, the state of Texas declared the Plaza Theatre to be a Historical Landmark.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was briefly reopened in 1970 and 1980, only to finally close its doors in 1989.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1989, after years of infrequent programming, the decision was made to demolish the Plaza Theatre in order to make way for a parking lot. Spurred by a groundswell of community support, the El Paso Community Foundation began negotiations to raise the required $9 million to save the theater from demolition. With only six weeks to raise the funds, fundraising events were held across the community with the most visible effort being staged by actress [[Rita Moreno]] the day before the deadline. It was announced that evening that enough money had been raised to save the Plaza Theatre. After the El Paso Community Foundation placed a new roof on the theater, it was donated to the [[El Paso, Texas|City of El Paso]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even though this theater was falling, it was still trying to pull itself up.

===Reopening===
One of the few remaining theaters of its kind in the country, the Plaza had lost most of its original splendor. Furnishings and artwork had been removed, the facade had been altered, and parts of its once-advanced electrical systems were no longer functional, yet the interior structure appeared as it had for close to seventy years. In 2000, a volunteer steering committee, assembled by the El Paso Community Foundation, began to assess the viability of restoring the Plaza Theatre. The committee concluded that the project was feasible, and in 2001, a leading promoter, producer and marketer of live entertainment events, conducted an extensive survey of El Paso's local performing arts community. The survey concluded that: a market did exist in El Paso for additional performing arts programming, and that the public had a strong affinity for the Plaza and was eager to attend events at a restored Plaza. On July 30, 2002 the City of El Paso formally approved a public/private partnership with the El Paso Community Foundation to restore the Plaza Theatre to its original appearance. The Foundation committed to raising $12 million towards the renovation effort, to restoring and reinstalling the Mighty Wurlitzer Organ at the Plaza Theatre, and to donating the adjacent building (Centre Annex), which would be integrated into the overall operations of the Plaza. The City of El Paso agreed to fund the remaining cost of the restoration.

[[Thos. S. Byrne, Ltd.]] and Arrow Builders were hired to perform the restoration. The companies took particular interest in the project, noting that "With over 2,000 seats at the commencement of restoration, the Plaza is currently one of the nation's largest non-functioning theaters in the United States." The companies worked diligently to insure all phases of construction complied with historical restoration guidelines.

At a cost of nearly $38 million, the Plaza reopened on March 17, 2006.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first performance hosted at the refurbished theater was [[Riverdance]] which played Friday, March 17, 2006 through Sunday, March 19 with multiple sold-out performances. The reopened theater boasts a 2,050-seat main theater with a 10-story stage house capable of handling large traveling Broadway shows. In addition, with the completion of the Centre Annex, the facility includes a 200-seat children's theater, a rooftop garden, meeting facilities and a privately managed restaurant. The smaller theater is named the [http://www.plazatheater.org/philanthropy.sstg Philanthropy Theatre].

Despite the completion of the project, the El Paso Community Foundation continues appropriating funds to buy back original art and furnishings of the Plaza.

==The building==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Plaza Theater Staircase.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The main staircase of the Plaza Theatre: A view of the interior.]]  --&gt;[[File:Plaza Theater at Night.jpg|alt=Plaza theater at night.|thumb|The Plaza Theater at night.]]
No expense was spared in creating the elaborate building. At the point where the entrance wing of the Plaza adjoined the auditorium, a domed tower rises in three tiers, projecting above the roof line. Other exterior references to the [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture|Spanish mission-style]] included modest brick delineations at the building's corners, simple [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]] motifs and stepped and curved parapets with tile accents along the roof line. While the exterior facade was designed to be reminiscent of a mission-style parapet, patrons were awed by the interior, with its intricately [[fresco|painted ceilings]], [[mosaic]]-tiled floors, Posh carpeting, decorative wrought iron banisters and sconces and, to heighten the effect, antique furnishings. Due to such [[Rococo|grandiose rococo]] design, the Plaza became known as "The Showplace of the Southwest."

===The Mighty Wurlitzer===
Further emphasis of the illustrious interior stands in the $60,000 [[Wurlitzer organ#Theatre organs|Mighty Wurlitzer Organ]], designed to elevate from the [[orchestra pit]] to accompany vaudeville shows, sing-alongs, and to entertain patrons before and after films. Its "toy box" provides the organ with the versatility to replicate such sounds as horses' hooves, the ocean surf and birds chirping. The organ had 15 ranks with 61 pipes in each rank.

In 1973, the Mighty Wurlitzer Organ was sold at auction and housed at the home of a private collector in Dallas. In 1998 the organ was restored and returned to El Paso as a donation by the late Karl O. Wyler, Sr.. During renovations of the theater, the organ was put on display at [[Sunland Park Mall]] located in [[Northwest El Paso]] The organ was rebuilt by Pipe Organ Artisans of Arizona, Tucson, and re-installed. The Opus 2123 console was returned to its original finish. It is the only one of its kind (a Wurlitzer Balaban III) left intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.epcf.org/news_detail.sstg?id=90|title = Organ Artisans Tackle a|date = 11 October 2005|accessdate = 14 August 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928122624/http://www.epcf.org/news_detail.sstg?id=90|archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
* Through the years, the Plaza hosted such popular entertainers as [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Dale Evans]], the [[Barrymore family]], [[Sally Rand]], [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Hopalong Cassidy]], [[John Wayne]], the [[Marx Brothers]], [[Rita Moreno]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Tom Mix]], and [[James Stewart]].
* The original [[seating capacity]] was 2,410, with 1,510 seats on the main floor, 508 in the mezzanine and 392 in the balcony. Before reopening, the seating accommodations were diminished to provide future patrons with wider, more comfortable seating.
* Originally, [[Colored|colored patrons]] were only allowed to sit in the balcony of the theater. The main seating was segregated as [[White people|white]] seating only.
* The Plaza had one [[fallout shelter]] located beneath the stage. Prior to restoration, food rations could still be found within the shelter with the original packagings intact.

'''Prince Hubertus of Hohenlohe-Langenburg''' (born 2 February 1959 in [[Mexico City]] as '''Hubertus Rudolph zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg'''; {{IPA-es|uˈβeɾt̪us ruˈðolf su oẽnˈloe.lãŋxẽmˈbuɾɣ}}) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Alpine skiing|Alpine skier]], photographer, businessman, and a pop singer known as '''Andy Himalaya''' and '''Royal Disaster'''. He belongs to a family which [[reign]]ed over a principality in what is now the northeastern of [[Baden-Württemberg]] in Germany until the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;He possesses [[dual citizenship]] in the country of his birth, Mexico, and in the country of his legal domicile, Liechtenstein. While Mexican law does not recognize [[nobility]] or [[hereditary title]]s, Liechtenstein recognizes both.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life==
A son of [[Prince Alfonso of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]] and [[Princess Ira von Fürstenberg]], Hubertus was born in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] where his father ran a [[Volkswagen]] factory. His grandmother is half [[Mexican people|Mexican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1963932,00.html | work=Time | title=Why Is a German Prince Skiing For Mexico? | date=2010-02-13 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Mexico for the first four years of his life and then moved to Spain. He later studied in Austria and his main residence was in [[Vienna]], where he works as a photographer and artist. Although he has Mexican nationality, which makes him eligible to compete for Mexico, he only spends a few weeks a year there. He is fluent in several languages and grew up in [[Europe]], mainly [[Austria]]. Hohenlohe had a brother named [[Prince Christoph of Hohenlohe-Langenburg|Christoph]] (1956–2006) and has two half-sisters (Arriana Mara and Désirée). He currently resides in [[Liechtenstein]], of which he is also a citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mexikos Skifahrer tritt in Sotschi als Mariachi an|url=http://www.n24.de/n24/Nachrichten/n24-netzreporter/d/4189914/mexikos-skifahrer-tritt-in-sotschi-als-mariachi-an.html|work=[[N24 (Germany)|N24]] Nachrichten|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle [[Max von Hohenlohe]] competed at the 1956 Winter Olympics. He is first cousins with [[Prince Marco of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]].

Hubertus acted as co-producer for [[Yello]] and [[Shirley Bassey]]'s 1987 collaborative single "[[The Rhythm Divine]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Yello-Featuring-Shirley-Bassey-The-Rhythm-Divine/release/1198073 |title=Yello Featuring Shirley Bassey – The Rhythm Divine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |website=[[Discogs]]|access-date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubertus has work on display with the [[Art of the Olympians]] &lt;ref&gt;http://artoftheolympians.org/artists/hubertus-von-hohenlohe/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports career==
Hohenlohe founded the [[Mexican Ski Federation]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=SI-2015-03-06&gt; {{cite magazine |url= https://www.si.com/edge/2015/03/06/prince-hubertus-von-hohenlohe-mexican-ski-team |title= Mariachi Man: Prince Hubertus and the Mexican ski team he helped create |author= Tik Root |date= 6 March 2015 |publisher= Sports Illustrated }} &lt;/ref&gt; He first skied for Mexico at a Winter Olympics at the [[1984 Winter Olympics|1984 games]] in [[Sarajevo]], and managed to finish 26th in slalom. After the 1984 Winter Olympics, Hohenlohe managed to participate in [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988]], [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992]], and [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] Games.&lt;ref name=NYT-2017-11-17&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/sports/olympics/nigeria-has-an-olympic-bobsled-team-and-tonga-had-a-luger.html |title= Nigeria Has an Olympic-Level Bobsled Team, and Tonga Had a Luger |author= Victor Mather |date= 17 November 2017 |publisher= New York Times }} &lt;/ref&gt; He qualified for the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]], but the Mexican [[Olympic Committee]] decided not to send a one-man team to the Winter Games that year.

Hohenlohe has stated that the only reason why he continues to participate is because it seems that the "exotic skiers" (those from countries without a tradition in winter sports) are disappearing, and that he wants to keep that tradition alive.&lt;ref name=SI-2015-03-06/&gt; Since 1982, he has participated in 15 World Championships and set a World Record.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Hohenlohe was expected to retire following the [[2007 Alpine Skiing World Championships]], after breaking his leg during a World Cup slalom race on January 28, 2007, eliminating him from the competition in [[Åre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skiracing.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4728&amp;Itemid=2]&lt;/ref&gt;

He came back to competition in 2009 and competed in his 12th World Championship, the [[2009 Alpine Skiing World Championships]].

Hubertus was the sole athlete in the [[Mexico at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Mexican team]] at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. He participated in two alpine skiing disciplines, the [[Alpine skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Men's giant slalom|Men's Giant Slalom]] (78th) and the [[Alpine skiing at the 2010 Winter Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Men's slalom|Men's Slalom]] (46th).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-alpine-skiing/athletes/hubertus-von-hohenlohe_ath1056076cr.html&lt;/ref&gt;  At 51, he was the oldest athlete at the games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vecernji.hr/sport/vijesti/ivan-sola-je-sa-47-godina-medu-starcima-igara-clanak-99893&lt;/ref&gt;  He also competed at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zaccardi|first=Nick|title=Prince Hubertus von Hohenlohe of Mexico will be second oldest Winter Olympian ever|url=http://olympictalk.nbcsports.com/2014/01/02/prince-hubertus-von-hohenlohe-of-mexico-will-be-oldest-olympian-skier/|work=NBC Olympic Talk|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was Mexico's sole athlete again. He participated in slalom but did not finish after a fall during the first run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/afp/140222/olympics-mexican-mariachi-von-hohenlohe-crashes-out-slalom Olympics Mexican mariachi von Hohenlohe crashes out slalom] ''Global Post'', retrieved 28 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he was joined by [[Sarah Schleper]] on the Mexican ski team, doubling its size.&lt;ref name=SI-2015-03-06/&gt;

von Hohenlohe, affectionately called ''El Príncipe'', mooted retiring for 2017,&lt;ref name=SI-2015-03-06/&gt; but instead decided to qualify for the [[2018 Winter Olympics]]. &lt;ref name=2017-02-23&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.aol.com/article/news/2017/02/23/mexican-prince-eyes-title-as-oldest-winter-olympian-ever/21718797/ |title= Mexican prince eyes title as oldest Winter Olympian ever |publisher= AOL |date= 23 February 2017 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Another two hopes for [[Alpine Mexico]], aside from Hubertus, and Schleper, are [[Rodolfo Dickson]] and [[Jocelyn McGillivray]]. Additionally, three more hope to represent Mexico, [[Robby Franco]] in freestyle skiing, [[Sandra Hillen]] in snowboard and [[German Madrazo]] in Cross-country skiing. &lt;ref name=ESPN-2017-10-31&gt; {{cite news |url= http://www.espn.com/blog/onenacion/post/_/id/8098/tres-company-for-the-mexico-ski-team-in-the-winter-olympics |title= 'Tres' company for the Mexico ski team in the Winter Olympics |author= Adriana Terrazas |date= 31 October 2017 |publisher= ESPN }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eSportesMX-2017-05-18&gt; {{es icon}} {{Cite web |url= http://www.esportes.mx/tres-mexicanos-acudiran-a-pyeongchang-2018/ |title= Tres mexicanos acudirán a Pyeongchang 2018 |date= 18 May 2017 |publisher= Esportes.MX }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SIPSE-2017-08-11&gt; {{es icon}} {{cite news |url= https://sipse.com/deportes/mexico-presente-juegos-olimpicos-invernales-2018-deportes-264676.html |title= México estará presente en los Juegos Olímpicos Invernales de 2018 |date= 11 August 2017 |publisher= SIPSE.com }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EBD-2017-02-23&gt; {{cite web |url= https://elbigdata.mx/sport-data/cuarta-parte-mexico-con-cuatro-o-cinco-atletas-a-pyeongchang-2018/ |title= México con cuatro o cinco atletas a Pyeongchang 2018 |date= 23 February 2017 |author= Carlos Alberto Cruz |publisher= El Big Data }} &lt;/ref&gt; He failed to qualify for the 2018 Olympics, but designed the race suits for the Mexican alpine skiers. .&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite news |last=Boren |first=Cindy |date=11 February 2018 |title=The Mexican Olympic ski team's Day of the Dead uniforms will haunt you |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/02/11/the-mexican-olympic-ski-teams-day-of-the-dead-uniforms-will-haunt-you/ |newspaper=The Washington Post}} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2794">'''Romano Artioli''' (born 1932)&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Artemi, ''Bugatti, la fabbrica di sogni'' in [[Corriere della Sera]] (Dec 28, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Italy|Italian]] entrepreneur and one-time owner of [[Bugatti]] and [[Lotus (car)|Lotus]] automobile brands.

Artioli was born in [[Moglia]] in the [[Province of Mantua]], and raised in [[Bolzano]] where in the 1980s he ran one of the largest [[Ferrari]] dealerships in the world, selling in northern Italy and southern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Automobile Quarterly]], vol. 46, issue 2 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
He also imported Japanese cars, owning ''Autoexpò'' which in 1982 became the first Italian importer of [[Suzuki]].&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Caldero, ''Buon compleanno Suzuki: da 25 anni anche in Italia'' in [[La Repubblica]] (June 7, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  

He had a large collection of Bugatti automobiles,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
and was encouraged by [[Ferruccio Lamborghini]] and Paolo Stanzani to establish ''Bugatti International'', a holding company that bought the Bugatti trademark name in 1987.
Artioli became chairman of [[Bugatti#Bugatti Automobili S.p.A.|Bugatti Automobili S.p.A.]], which made the [[Bugatti EB 110]] between 1991 and 1995.
In 1993, his wife Renata Kettmeir formed the [[Bolzano]]-based ''Ettore Bugatti'' luxury item maker, also using the Bugatti "EB" logo. Their involvement ended in September 1995 due to [[bankruptcy]],&lt;ref&gt;John Tagliabue, ''Hard Times for a Dream Car's Descendant'' in ''[[New York Times]]'' (November 23, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and the company was eventually bought by [[Volkswagen]] in April 1998. Prior to the sale to Volkswagen, private equity Investor CVC Ventures (a Citibank company) attempted a purchase of Bugatti via UK corporate finance advisor Anglo American Ventures however the £100m deal failed at due diligence stage.

Artioli purchased [[Lotus (car)|Lotus]] from [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in August 1993 and became its chairman until 1996 when he stepped down to be Special Projects director until 1998. 
He sold a majority stake to [[Proton (car)|Proton]] in 1996 to fund his losses due to the insolvency of Bugatti.

His daughter [[Elena Artioli]] (born 1970) is a politician for the [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] and
[[Lega Nord Alto Adige – Südtirol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elenaartioli.com/ elenaartioli.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011100544/http://www.elenaartioli.com/ |date=2009-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Lotus Elise]] was named after Romano Artioli's granddaughter Elisa Artioli.

== History ==
The company is one of the oldest family-owned businesses in the U.S,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cowen | first = Lee | title = In Good Company: A Family History at SC Johnson | newspaper = CBS Sunday Morning | date = October 16, 2016 | url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-family-history-at-sc-johnson/ | access-date = April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning in 1886 when [[Samuel Curtis Johnson, Sr. | Samuel Curtis Johnson]] purchased the parquet flooring division from the Racine Hardware Manufacturing Company and named the new business S. C. Johnson. The company’s principal product at that time was parquet flooring, later adding other floor care products like Johnson’s Prepared Wax, Johnson’s Dance Wax and Johnson’s Wood Dye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pfankuchen | first = David | title = Parquet Floors Launched Firm | newspaper = The Journal Times | date = September 21, 1986 | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/342875541/ | access-date = April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under [[Herbert Fisk Johnson Sr.]], the company expanded worldwide, establishing its first subsidiary in England in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pfankuchen | first = David | title = Parquet Floors Launched Firm | newspaper = The Journal Times | date = September 21, 1986 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/342875541/ | access-date = April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Giving his employees credit for a successful year, Herbert gave them $35,000 in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Staff Writer | title = Johnson Gives His Employes [sic] Credit for Successful Year | newspaper = The Racine Journal-News | date = December 22, 1917 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/333942445/ | access-date = March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Staff Writer |  title = Herbert F.

C. Johnson’s line of wax-reliant products necessitated [[Herbert Fisk Johnson Jr.]]’s 1935 expedition to Fortaleza, Brazil to find a direct sustainable source of wax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Staff Writer |  title = Wax Hunt | newspaper = Time | date = October 14, 1935 | access-date = April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 1935 until May 1950, the company was the sponsor for the [[Fibber McGee and Molly]] [[Golden Age of Radio|radio show]], officially known as ''The Johnson Wax Program''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Stumpf | first1 = Charles | last2 = Price | first2 = Tom | title = Heavenly Days!

In April of 1939, the [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]-designed SC Johnson Administration Building opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Staff Writer | title = New Frank Lloyd Wright Office Building Shows Shape of Things to Come | newspaper = LIFE | date = May 8, 1939 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rEkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22New+Frank+Lloyd+Wright+Office+Building+Shows+Shape+of+Things+to+Come%22+%22sc+johnson%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjotf-Vk8faAhXmdN8KHWtjDKYQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22New%20Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright%20Office%20Building%20Shows%20Shape%20of%20Things%20to%20Come%22%20%22sc%20johnson%22&amp;f=false | access-date = April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its addition, the Research Tower, opened in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Staff Writer | title = Speaking of Pictures: Johnson’s new “Heliolab” makes strange patterns both by night and by day | newspaper = LIFE | date = December 11, 1950 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yEsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22LIFE%22+December+11,+1950+%22rex+harrison%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinuJG5lcfaAhVSh-AKHdtyBgsQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Johnson&amp;f=false | access-date = April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Johnson Wax Headquarters | SC Johnson Headquarters]] was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory – Nomination Form - S.

The launch of Raid House &amp; Garden Bug Killer in 1955 marked the company’s first major departure away from wax-based products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Cowen | first = Lee | title = In Good Company: A Family History at SC Johnson | newspaper = CBS Sunday Morning | date = October 16, 2016 | url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-family-history-at-sc-johnson/ | access-date = April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the next few years, [[Samuel Curtis Johnson, Jr. | Sam Johnson]], fourth generation leader, introduced some of the company’s best known: [[Glade (brand) |Glade]], [[Off!

In April 2018, the company updated their [[tagline]] from “A Family Company,” which began in 1998,  to “A Family Company at Work for a Better World.”  According to the company, the updated tagline is “A reminder that SC Johnson holds itself to a higher standard.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://journaltimes.com/business/local/sc-johnson-updates-its-slogan-a-family-company-at-work/article_3d3df663-2caf-5458-8283-824d036ec3d1.html|title=SC Johnson updates its slogan: 'A Family Company at Work for a Better World'|last=Times|first=For The Journal|work=Journal Times|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental record ==
S.&amp;nbsp;C. Johnson &amp; Son's Greenlist process is a classification system that evaluates the effects of raw materials on human health and the environment. The Greenlist logo represents an internal ratings system to help customers identify which products are environmentally safe. The Greenlist label is present in many S.&amp;nbsp;C. Johnson &amp; Son products. The Greenlist process has resulted in the elimination of 1.8 million pounds of [[volatile organic compound]]s from [[Windex]], and four million pounds of [[polyvinylidene chloride]] from [[Saran (plastic)|Saran Wrap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnmoney.com|title=CNNMoney – Business, financial and personal finance news|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, S.&amp;nbsp;C. Johnson &amp; Son settled a lawsuit that alleged the company's Greenlist label misled consumers into believing the products were reviewed by a third party and given a seal of approval. The company agreed to an undisclosed sum and dropped the labeling of Greenlist on Windex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scjohnson.com/en/press-room/press-releases/07-08-2011/SC-Johnson-Settles-Cases-Involving-Greenlist-Labeling.aspx|title=SC Johnson Settles Cases Involving Greenlist Labeling {{!}} Press Room|website=www.scjohnson.com|access-date=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S.&amp;nbsp;C. Johnson &amp; Son is the main sponsor of the [[Serra das Almas Private Natural Heritage Reserve]] in the states of [[Ceará]] and [[Piauí]], Brazil.  The reserve protects an area of the [[caatinga]] biome, including wild specimens of the carnauba palm tree ([[Copernicia prunifera]]), the source of [[carnauba wax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|language=Portuguese|publisher=Associação Caatinga |author=Rodrigo Castro |title=Reserva Natural Serra das Almas / CE |url=http://www.rppnweb.com/site_rppn/index.php/proprietarios-de-rppn/229-rodrigo-de-castro-reserva-natural-serra-das-almas-ce|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2012, S.&amp;nbsp;C. Johnson &amp; Son began operation of two [[wind turbine]]s at their largest manufacturing facility in [[Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin]]. The turbines, in addition to the gas reclamation system in place at a nearby landfill, are estimated to produce enough electricity to completely power the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scjohnson.com/en/press-room/press-releases/12-18-2012/SC-Johnson-Powers-Up-Wind-Energy-at-Largest-Mfg-Facility.aspx|title=SC Johnson Powers Up Wind Energy at Largest Mfg Facility – Press Room|work=scjohnson.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
A [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] lawsuit by tax whistleblower Mike DeGuelle alleges that since 1997, S.&amp;nbsp;C. Johnson &amp; Son has taken advantage of audit errors and filed fraudulent tax returns, underpaying its taxes by millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.tax.com/taxcom/taxblog.nsf/Permalink/UBEN-8BTJ35?OpenDocument | title=Can Loopholes Blow the Whistle on Whistleblowers? | work=Tax.com | accessdate=2010-12-06 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716194036/http://www.tax.com/taxcom/taxblog.nsf/Permalink/UBEN-8BTJ35?OpenDocument | archivedate=2011-07-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; H. Fisk Johnson ordered an inquiry into the allegations, and told [[Tax Analysts]] that he learned "other details of the decisions they (the tax department) made that I didn't like. I didn't like what I heard." On December 15, 2011, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], in Case No. 10-2172, ruled that DeGuelle had alleged a valid claim that the company's discharge of him was part of the tax fraud scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.whistleblowersblog.org/2011/12/articles/corporate-1/major-victory-for-whistleblowers-in-seventh-circuit-says-retaliation-is-a-rico-violation/ | title=Major Victory for Whistleblowers in Seventh Circuit Says Retaliation is a RICO Violation | work=Whistleblowers Protection Blog | accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zabludowicz was born in a Jewish family in [[Łódź]], Poland. His father was  a rabbi. Zabludowicz and his family was interned at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], where only he and his wife Pola survived. After the war, he immigrated to Finland via Sweden.&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt; In Finland, he had two children, business magnate [[Poju Zabludowicz]] and ophthalmologist [[Rebecka Belldegrun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Coren |first=Ora |date=12 October 2004 |title=Soltam heirs near end of feud over father's $200-300m fortune  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/soltam-heirs-near-end-of-feud-over-father-s-200-300m-fortune-1.137164 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1975, he immigrated to Israel.&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt;

[[File:Escasez en Venezuela, Central Madeirense 8.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|A 2014 image of product [[shortages in Venezuela]].]]

In [[economics]], a '''shortage''' or '''excess demand''' is a situation in which the [[demand]] for a [[product (business)|product]] or [[service (economics)|service]] exceeds its [[supply (economics)|supply]] in a [[market (economics)|market]]. It is the opposite of an [[excess supply]] ([[economic surplus|surplus]]).

== Definitions ==
In a [[perfect market]] (one that matches a simple [[microeconomic]] model), an excess of demand will prompt sellers to increase [[price]]s until demand at that price matches the available supply, establishing [[economic equilibrium|market equilibrium]]&lt;ref&gt;Tucker (2014) Economics Today&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. In economic terminology, a shortage occurs when for some reason (such as government intervention, or decisions by sellers not to raise prices) the price does not rise to reach equilibrium.  In this circumstance, buyers want to purchase more at the market price than the quantity of the good or service that is available, and some non-price mechanism (such as "first come, first served" or a lottery) determines which buyers are served. So in a perfect market the only thing that can cause a shortage is price.

In common use, the term "shortage" may refer to a situation where most people are unable to find a desired good at an affordable price, especially where supply problems have increased the price.  "[[Market clearing]]" happens when all buyers and sellers willing to transact at the prevailing price are able to find partners.  There are almost always willing buyers at a lower-than-market-clearing price; the narrower technical definition doesn't consider failure to serve this demand as a "shortage", even if it would be described that way in a social or political context (which the simple model of [[supply and demand]] does not attempt to encompass).

== Causes ==
Shortages (in the technical sense) may be caused by:
* [[Price ceiling]]s, a type of [[price control]] which involves a government-imposed limit on the price of a product service.
* Anti-[[price gouging]] laws.
* Government [[ban (law)|ban]] on the sale of a product or service, such as [[prostitution]] or certain [[recreational drug use|recreational drugs]].
* Decisions by suppliers not to raise prices, for example to maintain friendly relationships with potential future customers during a supply disruption.
* [[Artificial scarcity]]

== Effects ==
Decisions which result in a below-market-clearing price help some people and hurt others. In this case, shortages may be accepted because they theoretically enable a certain portion of the population to purchase a product that they couldn't afford at the market-clearing price. The cost is to those who are willing to pay for a product and either can't, or experience greater difficulty in doing so.

In the case of [[government intervention]] in the market, there is always a trade-off with positive and negative effects. For example, a price ceiling may cause a shortage, but it will also enable a certain percentage of the population to purchase a product that they couldn't afford at market costs. Economic shortages caused by higher [[transaction costs]] and [[opportunity costs]] (e.g., in the form of lost time) also mean that the distribution process is wasteful. Both of these factors contribute to a decrease in aggregate wealth.

Shortages may cause:

* [[Black market]]s, illegal markets in which products that are unavailable in conventional markets are sold, or in which products with excess demand are sold at higher prices than in the conventional market.
* Artificial controls of demand, such as time (such as waiting in line) and [[rationing]].
* Non-monetary bargaining methods, such as time (for example [[Queue area|queuing]]), [[nepotism]], or even violence. 
* [[Price discrimination]].
* The inability to purchase a product, and subsequent [[forced saving]].

== Examples ==
[[File:Entre Libertador y Chacao los indigentes sobrevive con desechos.webm|250px|thumb|right|Citizens of [[Caracas, Venezuela]] searching for food in garbage in 2016]]
* [[Rationing in the United Kingdom]] occurred mainly during and after the world wars
* From 1920 to 1933 during [[prohibition in the United States]], the creation of a black market for [[liquor]] was created due to the low supply of [[alcoholic beverages]].
* During the [[1973 oil crisis]], during which long lines and rationing was used to control demand.
* In the former [[Soviet Union]] during the 1980s, prices were artificially low by fiat (i.e., high prices were outlawed). Soviet citizens waited in line (or "queued") for various [[Price controls|price-controlled]] goods and services such as cars, apartments, or some types of clothing. From the point of view of those waiting in line, such goods were in perpetual "short supply"; some of them were willing and able to pay more than the official price ceiling, but were legally prohibited from doing so. This method for determining the allocation of goods in short supply is known as "[[rationing]]".
* From the mid-2000s through the 2010s, [[shortages in Venezuela]] occurred, due to the Venezuelan government's economic policies;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Venezuela seizes warehouses packed with medical goods, food|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy-idUSKCN0ID00A20141024|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2014-10-24|access-date = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as relying on foreign imports while creating strict [[foreign exchange controls]], put price controls in place and having [[expropriation]]s result with lower domestic production. As a result of such shortages, Venezuelans had to search for products, wait in lines for hours and rationing was initiated, with the government allowing the purchase of a certain amount of products through [[fingerprint recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why are Venezuelans posting pictures of empty shelves?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-30710014|accessdate=10 January 2015|agency=BBC|date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=REUTjan2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cawthorne|first1=Andrew|title=In shortages-hit Venezuela, lining up becomes a profession|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/21/us-venezuela-shortages-idUSKBN0KU1BX20150121|accessdate=17 June 2015|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJoct2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaefer Muñoz|first1=Sara|title=Despite Riches, Venezuela Starts Food Rationing; Government Rolls Out Fingerprint Scanners to Limit Purchases of Basic Goods; 'How Is it Possible We've Gotten to This Extreme'|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/despite-riches-venezuela-starts-food-rationing-1414025667|accessdate=11 November 2014|agency=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether an economic shortage of a certain good or service is beneficial or detrimental to society often depends on one's [[ethics|ethical]] and [[politics|political]] views. For instance, consider the shortage of recreational drugs discussed above, and the controversies around the use of such drugs. Likewise, consider the economic shortage of cars in the Soviet Union during the 1980s: On the one hand, people had to wait in line to buy a new car; on the other hand, cars were more affordable than they would have been at market prices.

== Shortages and "longages" ==
[[Garrett Hardin]] emphasised that a shortage of supply can just as well be viewed as a "longage" of [[demand]]. For instance, a shortage of food can just as well be called a longage of people ([[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]). By looking at it from this view, he felt the problem could be better dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/videos/video_803_segment5.html Video Interview with Garrett Hardin: Longages and Overpopulation Predictions] Educational Communications program 803, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labour shortage==
In its narrowest definition, a labour shortage is an [[economics|economic condition]] in which employers believe there are insufficient qualified candidates (employees) to fill the [[demand|marketplace demands]] for [[employment]] at a wage that is mostly employer-determined. Such a condition is sometimes referred to by [[economist]]s as "an insufficiency in the [[labour force]]." An [[Aging in the American workforce|ageing population and a contracting workforce]] and a [[birth dearth]] may curb U.S. economic expansion for several decades, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonexaminer.com/news/business/2011/08/shrinking-labor-force-may-curb-us-expansion-two-decades Shrinking labour force may curb U.S. expansion for two decades]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wage factors===
[[Wage|Wage levels]] have been suggested as one way to measure a labour shortage. However, that often does not match people's common perceptions. For example, if wages alone are the best measure of labour shortages, then that would imply that doctors, instead of farm workers, should be imported because doctors are far more expensive than farm workers. However, there are institutionally-imposed limits on the number of doctors that are allowed to be licensed.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} If foreign migrant workers were not allowed into a nation, farm wages may go up but probably not enough to approach the wages of doctors.

The [[Atlantic slave trade]] (which originated in the early 17th century but ended by the early 19th century) was said to have originated from perceived shortages of agricultural labour in the [[Americas]] (particularly in the [[Southern United States]]). It was thought that bringing African labor was the only means of [[malaria]] resistance available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaria.com/blog/american-plasmodium-vivax "As American as…Plasmodium vivax?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, malaria seems to itself have been introduced to the "New World" via the slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencedude.blog.ocregister.com/2011/12/26/uci-new-world-malaria-linked-to-slave-trade/166005/ "UCI: New World malaria linked to slave trade."]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanko "Cane" Subotić''' (born 9 September 1959, [[Kalinovac (Ub)|Kalinovac]], [[People's Republic of Serbia|PR Serbia]], [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]]) is a [[Geneva]]-based Serbian businessman. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment for abuse of office,{{clarify|date=January 2016}} but the case is on appeal. 

Subotić is the founder and owner of the [[Denmark]]-based company EMI (Emerging Marketing Investment) and [[D Trade]] (based in Belgrade, Serbia), dealing in sales and distribution of wine, paper and real estate. Additionally, he is the co-owner of Serbia-based [[Futura Plus]], a commercial distribution network in Southeastern Europe. In Serbia, his companies employ over 4,000 people.{{citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Additionally, Subotić is the co-owner of the meat processing factory Famis LLC (founded in 2002 in Serbia), as well as distribution companies in [[Greece]] and [[Russia]] dealing in non-alcoholic beverages and sporting equipment. Moreover, he bought hundreds of acres of vineyards in [[France]], which he uses for production of the wine Louis Max, which has been served at the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=insajder&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/emisije/insajder.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=05&amp;nav_id=197780] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522054819/http://www.b92.net/info/emisije/insajder.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=05&amp;nav_id=197780 |date=22 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began investing in this company in 1989, and since January 2007 he is the sole owner of Max Holding.

Subotić owns a wine cellar in downtown [[Belgrade]] and the luxury hotel Villa Montenegro on [[Sveti Stefan]] island. In March 2007, this hotel was awarded the "Five Stars Diamond" award for the quality of service by the [[American Academy of Hospitality Sciences]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Early life and business career==
Subotić came from a working-class family, to which he was born as the sixth and youngest child. During early childhood, he started working in his father's carpentry shop. A Serbian national by birth, since 1999 He completed the streamlined High School of Economics in [[Ub, Serbia|Ub]], where he met his future wife Jagoda. He started earning an independent living in his early twenties when he left for [[France]] and got a job as a tailor. He opened a chain of clothing boutiques, and developed his own wholesale and retail.{{citation needed|date=August 2007}}

During mid-1980s he invested into Serbian economy, by supplying civil engineering equipment which he judged to be in short supply. Subotić started his private business career in 1991 following the collapse of communism in [[SFR Yugoslavia]] by founding a company named MIA and opening a sewing shop that cooperated with state owned [[retailer]] [[Robna kuća Beograd|Robne kuće Beograd]]. From that time until the year 1993, his primary business activities were textile production and confection.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

By 1995, he entered the cigarette trade in [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], a country under a [[United Nations|UN]] imposed [[trade embargo]]. Subotić owned two duty-free shops at the Đeneral Janković border crossing and in 1996 became exclusive distributor of foreign cigarette producers such as [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] and [[British American Tobacco]]. His cigarette trading business was initially based in Serbia, but, in 1997, after Vlada "Tref" Kovačević  and Radovan "Badža" Stojičić were murdered, Subotić relocated his entire business to [[Montenegro]] and moved there, where he established high political and business connections with the republic's Prime Minister [[Milo Đukanović]] and ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|DPS]] party president [[Svetozar Marović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.co.rs/temadana.php?id=5486|title=Mira i Marko predvodili jednu od mafijaških grupa|website=Blic.co.rs|date=9 June 2007|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Subotić opened a subsidiary in Montenegro, which is in operation to this day. The same year, he acquired the Serbian company [[Duvan]], owner of a large distribution network which included retail booths and kiosks selling printed media and other consumer goods, and founded the company [[Futura plus]]. After acquiring Duvan, in 2004, he began collaborating with the German media holding group [[WAZ-Mediengruppe|WAZ]], which brought him new points of sale as it acquired a majority stake at [[Politika AD|Politika distribution]]. Futura Plus now owns the largest media distribution network in Serbia with a large number of kiosks and newspaper stands, previously owned by Duvan, Politika distribution, [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba distribution]] and [[Duvanpromet]] from [[Kragujevac]]. After Serbian Prosecution raised accusations against Subotic in 2008, WAZ Media Group left Futura plus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=08&amp;nav_id=297516|title=VAC prodao udeo u "Futuri plus"|website=B92.net|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Montenegro he founded a company named Montenegro Futura that owns a similar distribution network throughout the country.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

In 2005, Subotić moved his business headquarters to [[Cyprus]]. During the Spring 2007, Subotić additionally expanded his activities with two large investments in Montenegro: purchasing a piece of the island of St Nikola near the port of [[Budva]] from a Serbian businessman, Nenad Đorđević, for approximately [[€]]24 million and announcing his plans to build a luxury hotel worth [[€]]20 million on the St. Stefan island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/story.php?vest=52391] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010608/http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/story.php?vest=52391 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Subotić faced numerous allegations and accusations of smuggling, tax evasion, and state budget defrauding stemming from 1990s cigarette trade in the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] that was under a UN trade embargo at the time.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

===The ''Nacional'' affair===
In May 2001, Croatia's ''[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]]'' newsmagazine, owned and edited by [[Ivo Pukanić]], published detailed accounts of Subotić's activities, claiming they involved organized crime figures as well as the highest echelons of the Montenegrin and Serbian political regimes. Largely unknown and unexposed up to that point, the entire ''Nacional'' affair forced Subotić into the public limelight as he began giving occasional interviews in the Serbian media. He responded that the news stories were fabrications paid for and planted by a competing Croatian tobacco producer, [[Tvornica duhana Rovinj]], supposedly threatened by Subotić's plans to jointly build a tobacco factory in Serbia with British American Tobacco in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2003/01/10/pisma/srpski/pisma.shtml|title=Stanko Subotić Cane: Moj deo istine|website=Arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the coming years, Subotić filed a series of lawsuits against ''Nacional'' and its owner/editor-in-chief Pukanić in [[Zagreb]] on the grounds of slander. In Croatia, Subotić was represented by a Croatian lawyer, Slobodan Budak. ''Nacional'' claimed that "Subotić lost each one of the 26 lawsuits he filed against the magazine", while Subotić's lawyer in Serbia, Vlado Pavićević, claimed his client has "at least nine court verdicts in his favour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Hronika/t31491.sr.html|title=Политика Online|website=Politika.rs|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 ''Insajder'' interview===
In mid 2006, Subotić was hit with a new series of accusations when findings of the 2003 Serbian police investigation (soubriquetted "Mreža") were obtained by several media outlets, including [[B92]]. In it, Subotić's involvement in cigarette trade between 1995 and 1999 is characterized as "smuggling without taxation made possible by high ranking members of [[Slobodan Milošević|Milošević]]'s regime".&lt;ref name=insajder/&gt;

On 15 May 2006, Subotić's taped interview with journalist [[Brankica Stanković]] aired on B92's ''[[Insajder]]'' programme. In it he claimed to have been shown the results of "Mreža" investigation way back in 2003 by then Serbian Interior Minister [[Dušan Mihajlović (politician)|Dušan Mihajlović]]. Subotić added that Mihajlović reassured him on the same occasion that he (Subotić) is not in any way subject of investigation, telling him that "your (Subotić's) business activities during the 1990s were found to be legit".{{cn|date=January 2016}}

===2007 'Mreža' arrests and Interpol arrest warrant===
On 6 June 2007 Serbian police arrested eight individuals, which it believes were part of a 15-person criminal group organized by Subotić. Subotić himself was not placed under arrest that day, because the police could not find him, however, an [[Interpol]] arrest warrant was later issued for him. The arrested individuals were placed in a 48-hour detention, and they include:
*Milan Popivoda, former chief of Novi Sad state security branch
*Miodrag Zavišić, former chief of Novi Sad police department
*Nebojša "Tarzan" Nikolić and Drage Dodeski, former federal customs bureau employees
*Milan "Mrgud" Milanović, former employee of different federal bodies and a prominent member of Škorpioni paramilitary unit. Since 2002 co-owner of Famis d.o.o. meat factory with Subotić&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Hronika/t30687.sr.html|title=Политика Online|website=Politika.rs|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Milan "Pekin" Ranković, an employee in Subotić's MIA company
*Ivana Olujić, accused of acting as a proxy in cigarette smuggling
*Miroslav "Miki" Pešić, accused of making payments on behalf of Subotić's MIA company.

On the same day, the [[Serbian Ministry of the Interior]] (MUP) issued a press release saying: "These arrests occurred following a detailed and thorough investigation taking place over several years in collaboration with special persecutor's office in regard to  "Mreža" investigation. Subotić's group is being accused of illegally importing cigarettes and selling them on the [[black market]]. By doing so they defrauded the state budget of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]80 million in unpaid tax. The money they made in Serbia was transferred to their accounts in [[Cyprus]] via [[Montenegro]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=59522] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608104436/http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=59522 |date=8 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Subotić, six other individuals were sought by police on the same occasion: Ivan Krčmaričić, Đorđe Subotić, Luka Nenadić, Jovica Ranđelović, Stevan Banović, and Nikola Milošević (Subotić's nephew). Subotić eventually responded to the charges through a press release forwarded to Montenegrin state news agency MINA on 26 June 2007. He claimed innocence adding he did business in line with widely used practices at the time, and added, "The goal of this thing that's started by [[Belgrade]] is to smear my reputation in front of my business partners in [[Serbia]] and the rest of [[Europe]], but I'm not the main target. This will turn into one more attack on [[Montenegro]] by those that are pathologically obsessed with its independence, like they were with [[Zoran Đinđić|Đinđić]] all until his death." Subotić accused Montenegrin opposition leader [[Nebojša Medojević]] of insinuations and of "writing newspaper columns that helped create the atmosphere for the murder of Zoran Đinđić". Subotić concluded by saying: "Medojević and [[Vojislav Koštunica]] are working on the satanization of the Montenegrin state by creating an impression of its supposed criminalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=26&amp;nav_id=252762|title=Subotić: Nisam švercovao cigarete|website=B92.net|date=26 June 2007|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 arrest and two-month detention in Moscow===
On 28 April 2008, Subotić was arrested in [[Moscow]] at [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] based on an [[Interpol]] red notice warrant issued against him by the Serbian police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/hronika.php?id=39776|title=Cane uhapšen u Moskvi|website=Blic.rs|date=29 April 2008|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though initially it looked like he'd be  transferred to native [[Serbia]] where he's indicted on smuggling and tax fraud charges, and despite the fact that Serbian authorities sent an official extradition request for him to Russia, the Russian authorities let him go free on 27 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/world/text.php?vest=101454] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709015514/http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/world/text.php?vest=101454 |date=9 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===B92 Interview, 16 March 2010===
Subotić accused [[Nebojša Medojević]], the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] party leader of [[Movement for Change]] of having organized a manhunt on him on the orders of [[Serbia]]n businessman [[Milan Beko]] and Delta Holding owner Miroslav Mišković after they stole 50 million from Subotić to buy [[Port of Belgrade]] and daily newspaper [[Večernje Novosti]]. Medojević had claimed that Subotić and Darko Šarić had been hiding in a Montenegrin police villa in [[Žabljak]], while Subotić claimed in an interview that he was in [[Geneva, Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=16&amp;nav_id=65829] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221052039/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=16&amp;nav_id=65829 |date=21 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Tadamasa Hayashi'''|林 忠正|extra=1853–1906}} was a Japanese art dealer who introduced  traditional [[Japanese art]] such as [[ukiyo-e]] to Europe.

Tadamasa was born to the Nagasaki family of physicians. When he was still a child, he was adopted into the Hayashi family, an upper-class [[samurai]] family of [[Toyama-han]]. He then attended the [[University of Tokyo]].  In 1878, he went to [[Paris]] as a translator to seek a new life abroad.  In Paris, he began a career as Japanese art dealer.

[[File:Title page Paris Illustre Le Japon vol 4 May 1886.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of Paris Illustré "Le Japon' vol. 4, May 1886, no. 45–46|alt= the front of an old French magazine showing a courtesan (oiran) in a colourful kimono her hair fantasically done up with cherry or almond blossom to the left]]

Hayashi provided the text for the May 1886 edition of ''Paris Illustré''. [[Vincent van Gogh]] traced the figure on the title page for his painting [[Japonaiserie (van Gogh)|''The Courtesan'']].&lt;ref&gt;''The Courtesan'' (1887), oil on canvas, [http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2122&amp;lang=en Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 he was a general commissioner of the Japanese art section at the World 's Fair in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;J.-L. Ferrier and Y. Le Pichon ''Art of the 20th Century: A year-by-year chronicle of painting, architecture, and sculpture''. Chêne-Hachette, 1999, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
He also worked with Dr. [[George Frederick Kunz]] and [[Heber R. Bishop]] in writing and producing the catalog to the famous jade collection given to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop Collection, Heber R.

To put things into proper perspective, in [[1991 Major League Baseball season|1991]], the second year of the league's contract with the network, CBS reported a loss of around $169 million in the third quarter of the year. A decline in advertiser interest caused revenue from the sale of commercials during CBS's baseball telecasts to plummet. All the while, CBS was still contractually obligated to pay Major League Baseball around $260 million a year through [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stee-Rike Four!: What's Wrong With the Business of Baseball?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4fBTgkTMKYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Baseball%20Network&amp;f=false|page=57|publisher= |isbn=|year= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Major League Baseball decided to seek the services of other networks, CBS offered US$120 million in annual rights fees over a two-year period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McCarver prefers all 4 games|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/72750573.html?dids=72750573:72750573&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+06%2C+1995&amp;author=Rudy+Martzke&amp;pub=USA+TODAY+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=McCarver+prefers+all+4+games&amp;pqatl=google|author=Rudy Martzke|newspaper=USA Today|date=October 6, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart|first=Larry|date=14 May 1993|title=CBS Makes a Late Pitch to Keep Baseball in Its Picture|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-14/sports/sp-35233_1_abc-and-nbc|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McClellan|first=Steve|date=17 May 1993|title=Two ways to go on baseball – CBS vs. ABC-NBC.

As part of MLB's attempt to produce and market the games in-house, it hoped to provide games of regional interests to appropriate markets.

Prior to this, Major League Baseball was projected to take a projected 55% cut in rights fees and receive a typical rights fee from the networks. When compared to the previous TV deal with CBS, The Baseball Network was supposed to bring in 50% less of the broadcasting revenue. The advertisers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball Network Fails to Wow Advertisers|url=http://adage.com/article/news/baseball-network-fails-wow-advertisers/88293/|author=Joe Mandese|newspaper=[[Advertising Age]]|date=February 28, 1994|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; were reportedly excited about the arrangement with The Baseball Network because the new package included several changes intended to boost [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], especially among younger viewers.

Arranging broadcasts through The Baseball Network seemed, on the surface, to benefit NBC and ABC (who each contributed $10 million in start-up funds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shaprio|first=Leonard|date=September 18, 1993|title=Untangling Baseball Network's Intricacies|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19930918&amp;id=lgocAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YXsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6968,2958950&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) since it gave them a [[monopoly]] on broadcasting Major League Baseball games. The deal was similar to a [[Brokered programming|time-buy]], instead of a traditional rights fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball on Disney?

It also stood to benefit the networks because they reduced the risk associated with purchasing the broadcast rights outright (in stark contrast to CBS's disastrous contract with Major League Baseball from the 1990–1993 seasons). NBC and ABC were to create a loss-free environment for each other and keep an emerging [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which had recently made an aggressive and ultimately successful $1.58 billion bid for the [[NFL on television|television rights]] for [[National Football Conference]] games (thus, becoming a major player in the sports broadcasting game in the process), at bay. As a result of Fox's NFL gain, CBS was weakened further by [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliate changes]], as a number of stations jumped to Fox from CBS (for example, in [[Detroit]], [[WWJ-TV]] replaced [[WJBK]]).

==Coverage==
The Baseball Network kicked off its coverage on July 12, 1994 on [[NBC]] with the [[1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] from [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABCs (and NBCs) of TBN's MLB plan|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED3D4C4865105C1&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|author=Barry Horn|newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=July 6, 1994|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBC broadcast team consisted of [[Bob Costas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=1994 All-Star Game Open|id=2v3pmoh8fLY}}&lt;/ref&gt; on play-by-play, with [[Joe Morgan]] and [[Bob Uecker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=October 15, 1995|title=SIGNOFF;World Series, as Told by Bob Uecker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/tv/signoff-world-series-as-told-by-bob-uecker.html|work=New York Times|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as analysts. Costas, a veteran presence at NBC, had been the network's secondary baseball play-by-play announcer behind [[Vin Scully]] during the 1980s. Morgan, who was also working for [[ESPN]] at the time, had spent two years at NBC in the mid-1980s and two years at ABC from 1988-1989. Uecker, the longtime voice of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], returned to national television for the first time since he worked for ABC in the 1970s and early 1980s.

[[Greg Gumbel]] hosted the pre game show; this was one of his first assignments for NBC after having left [[CBS Sports]] following the [[1994 College World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greg Gumbel Finds Saying Farewell Can Be Painful|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-06-10/sports/9406100238_1_david-kenin-gary-fencik-cbs-sports|author=Steve Nidetz|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 10, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helping with interviews were [[Hannah Storm]] and [[Johnny Bench]]. The 1994 All-Star Game reportedly sold out all its advertising slots. This was considered an impressive financial accomplishment, given that one 30-second spot cost US$300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opening Day a New Wrinkle TV Coverage|url=http://alb.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5715674|author=John Nelson|newspaper=[[Florida Times-Union]]|date=April 3, 1994|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC, meanwhile, was able to have its primary broadcast team from 1989 return intact.

More specifically, on regional Saturday night broadcasts and all non-"national" broadcasts, TBN let the two lead announcers from the opposing teams call the games involving their teams together.

Games involving either of the two Canadian-based MLB teams at the time, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Montreal Expos]], were not always included in the ''Baseball Night in America'' package. Canadian rightsholders were allowed to broadcast the games. When [[Major League Baseball on TSN|TSN]] (which owned the cable rights to the Blue Jays and Expos) covered the games in Canada, they re-broadcast the ''BNIA'' feed across their network. Typically, if the Blue Jays were idle for the day, the Expos would be featured on TSN. Also, [[CBET-DT|CBET]] (the [[CBC Television|CBC]] affiliate in [[Windsor, Ontario]]) would air Blue Jays games if the [[Detroit Tigers]] were not playing at home that night or if the Blue Jays scheduled to play in Detroit. Whether or not the game would air in the opposing team's market would depend on which time zone they were from, or if they shared a market with another team.

Ratings for both seasons of the ''Baseball Night in America'' regular season coverage were substantially higher than [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]]'s final season in 1993 (3.8) or any subsequent season on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]. ''Baseball Night in America'' earned a 6.2 during the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] [[1994 in baseball|1994 season]] and a 5.8 in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball's Back on TV, But Will Fans Tune In or Turn Off? |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1995/Baseball-s-Back-on-TV-But-Will-Fans-Tune-In-or-Turn-Off-/id-43e1ee849169871f2e40b6a953f921f6|author=John Nelson|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=April 20, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ABC and NBC last covered baseball together from 1976 to 1989, ABC had the rights to the World Series in odd-numbered years while NBC would cover the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series in said years. Likewise, this process would alternate in even numbered years, with ABC getting the All-Star Game and both LCS in years that NBC had the World Series.

The networks also promised not to begin any World Series weekend broadcasts after 7:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's A Whole, New Ballgame |url=http://articles.philly.com/1993-10-29/sports/25934892_1_abc-and-nbc-ken-schanzer-league-championship-series|author=Bill Fleischman|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=October 29, 1993|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When CBS held the television rights, postseason games routinely aired on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. at the earliest. This meant that [[Joe Carter]]'s dramatic [[1993 World Series|World Series]] clinching home run in 1993 occurred after midnight in the East. As CBS' baseball coverage progressed, the network dropped the 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. pregame coverage (in favor of airing [[sitcom]]s such as ''[[Evening Shade]]'') before finally starting its coverage at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time. The first pitch would generally arrive at approximately 8:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.

ABC won the rights to the first dibs at the World Series in August 1993 after [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] president Dennis Swanson won a coin toss&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC Wins Coin Toss for Game 7|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/77931900.html?dids=77931900:77931900&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+13%2C+1995&amp;author=&amp;pub=Orlando+Sentinel&amp;desc=ABC+WINS+COIN+TOSS+FOR+GAME+7&amp;pqatl=google|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=September 13, 1995|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC flips for Game 7 of Series|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-09-13/sports/1995256119_1_baseball-network-telecast-game-7|author=Milton Kent|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 15, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by calling "heads."

Schanzer agreed to the coin toss by ABC and NBC at the outset as the means of determining the order in which they would divide up the playoffs.

What separated The Baseball Network from previous television deals with Major League Baseball, and was by far the most controversial part of the deal, was that not all postseason games (aside from the World Series) were guaranteed to be shown nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Television / Analysis -- Who's On TV?

===Criticisms===
A major problem with ''Baseball Night in America''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Andriesen|first=David|date=20 July 1994|title=New TV deal a shame for baseball fans|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&amp;dat=19940720&amp;id=-TJPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M48DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6842,1957825&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the idea that viewers could not watch "important" games. Marty Noble put it in perspective by saying "With the ''Network'' determining when games will begin and which games are made available to which [[media market|TV markets]], Major League Baseball can conduct parts of its pennant races in relative secrecy." What added to the troubles of The Baseball Network was the fact that ''Baseball Night in America'' held exclusivity over every market.

Things got so bad for The Baseball Network that even local broadcasters objected to its operations. [[KSMO-TV]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], the primary over-the-air station for the [[Kansas City Royals]], went as far as to sue the Royals for breach of contract resulting from their broadcasts being "overexposed" and violating its territorial exclusivity. Worse yet, even if a market had only one team, the ABC or NBC affiliate could still not broadcast that team's game if the start time was not appropriate for the time zone.

Detroit viewers only had the option of viewing the early game of the night.

''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' columnist [[Tom Verducci]] for one, was very harsh on The Baseball Network, dubbing it both "America's regional pastime" and an "abomination." ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 June 1995|title=The Baseball Network says it'll abandon baseball|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19950624&amp;id=EUhWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GusDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6847,5969439&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in announcing the dissolution of The Baseball Network, said "The fact of the matter is, Major League Baseball seems incapable at this point in time, of living with any long term relationships, whether it's with fans, with players, with the political community in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], with the advertising community here in [[Manhattan]], or with its TV partners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Swing And A Miss|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&amp;title=Baseball%27s+attempt+to+juice+up+the+game+may+leave+a+sour+-+08.07.95+-+SI+Vault&amp;expire=&amp;urlID=432446172&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1006913%2Findex.htm&amp;partnerID=289881|author=[[Tom Verducci]]|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=August 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the start of the strike, [[Stanford University]]'s Roger Noll&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV SPORTS; The Baseball Network Says the Players' Analyst Struck Out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/26/sports/tv-sports-the-baseball-network-says-the-players-analyst-struck-out.html|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 26, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the Baseball Network deal (and the bargain-basement [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] cable renewal, which went from $100 million to $42 million because of their losses) reflected "poor business judgment on the part of management about the long-run attractiveness of their product to national broadcasters." He added that the $140 million that owners expected to share for the 1994 season (before the strike) from TBN was underestimated by "one-third to one-half" and fell below the annual average of $165 million needed to renew the TBN deal after two years. Meanwhile, Andy Zimbalist, author of ''Baseball and Billions'', and a [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]] consulting economist, insisted that baseball could have done better than the TBN deal with some combination of [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]] (which offered $120 million last-ditch bid for renewal), [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] and [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]]. Baseball shut out CBS and could have waited longer before closing them out."

Five years after The Baseball Network dissolved, [[NBC Sports]] [[play-by-play]] announcer Bob Costas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Later Costas' Not-so-sad Farewell To Baseball|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1995-06-25/sports/17963434_1_baseball-network-bob-costas-league-championship-series|author=Bob Raissman|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=June 25, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in his book ''Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Costas|first=Bob|date=2001|title=Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz09JodkPo8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Fair+Ball:+A+Fan%27s+Case+for+Baseball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LUVYVevZJcyjyASL3IGYCA&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Baseball%20Network&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=Crown/Archetype|page=28|isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that The Baseball Network was "stupid and an abomination." Costas further wrote that the agreement involving the World Series being the only instance of The Baseball Network broadcasting a nationally televised game was an unprecedented surrender of prestige, as well as a slap to all serious fans. He believed that The Baseball Network fundamentally corrupted the game and acknowledged that the most impassioned fans in baseball were now prevented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tbn TV's Baseball Nonsense|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/oct/05/tbn-tvs-baseball-nonsense/|author=Mike Bruton|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=October 5, 1995|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from watching many of the playoff games that they wanted to see, as all playoff games had been broadcast nationally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nidetz|first=Steve|date=October 6, 1995|title=Baseball Network's Success In Dulling-down Playoffs Causes Its Demise|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-10-06/sports/9510060080_1_baseball-network-yankee-haters-tbn|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for decades. Costas added that both the divisional series and the League Championship Series now merited scarcely higher priority than regional coverage provided for a [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] [[college football|football]] game between [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]] and [[University of Michigan|Michigan]].

According to [[Curt Smith (author)|Curt Smith]]'s book, ''The Voice – Mel Allen's Untold Story'', the longtime [[New York Yankees]] broadcaster and ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'' [[Mel Allen|host]] was quoted as saying "You wonder how anything would be worse [than CBS].

During the 1995 Division Series, the fan frustration with The Baseball Network was so bad that the mere mention of it during the [[1995 Seattle Mariners season|Mariners]]–[[1995 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] [[1995 American League Division Series|ALDS]] from public address announcer [[Tom Hutyler]] at [[Seattle]]'s [[Kingdome]] brought boos from most of the crowd.

Had the 1995 World Series gone to a seventh game, it would have then been broadcast by ABC. As it stands, Game 5 of the 1995 World Series is to date, the final Major League Baseball game to be broadcast on ABC.

Others would argue that a primary reason for its failure was its abandoning of localized markets in favor of more lucrative and stable advertising contracts afforded by turning to a national model of broadcasting, similar to the [[NFL on television|National Football League's television package]], which focuses on localized games, with one or two "national" games.

===Aftermath===
In the end, the venture would lose US$95 million in advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV SPORTS; Baseball Network Faces a Full Count|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/20/sports/tv-sports-baseball-network-faces-a-full-count.html|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 20, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly $500 million in national and local spending. The Baseball Network generated only about $5.5 million per team in revenue for each of the two years that it operated. To put things into proper perspective, in 1993 alone, CBS generated about $14.7 million per team. Much of this could possibly be traced back to the strike causing a huge drop in revenue, which in return caused baseball salaries to decrease by approximately $140,000 on average in 1995.

Both ABC and NBC soon publicly vowed to cut all ties with Major League Baseball for the remainder of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abc, Nbc Pull Plug On Baseball |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-06-24/news/9506240075_1_postseason-coverage-baseball-owners-abc-sports|author=Leonard Shapiro|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 24, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball Broadcasting Faces Uncertain Future|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/baseball-broadcasting-faces-uncertain-future/337690.html|newspaper=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=June 28, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC, NBC Quit Baseball Network : Television: Rights probably will be offered to CBS or Fox after this season.|author=Steve Nidetz|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-23/sports/sp-16313_1_baseball-network|agency=Associated Press|date=June 23, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed on to be the exclusive network carrier of [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Major League Baseball regular season games]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BASEBALL; ABC Issues Warning to Turner and Fox|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/13/sports/baseball-abc-issues-warning-to-turner-and-fox.html?pagewanted=print|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 13, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NBC kept a postseason-only (with the exception of even-numbered years when NBC had the rights to the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]) deal in the end, signing a deal to carry three Division Series games, one half of the [[League Championship Series]] (the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] in even numbered years and the [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]] in odd numbered years; Fox would televise the other LCS in said years), and the [[1997 World Series|1997]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gaffney|first=Jim|date=19 October 1997|title=Bob Costas finally takes his World Series cuts|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=19971019&amp;id=9z9UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OY4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4148,1255583&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Boca Raton News|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[1999 World Series]] respectively (Fox had exclusive rights to the [[1996 World Series|1996]], [[1998 World Series|1998]] and [[2000 World Series]]).

With ABC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BASEBALL;ABC Auditing Baseball Venture|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/22/sports/baseball-abc-auditing-baseball-venture.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 22, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; being sold to [[The Walt Disney Company]] in 1996, [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] would pick up daytime and late-evening Division Series games with a provision similar to [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|its National Football League games]], in which the games would only air on network affiliates in the [[Historical Major League Baseball over-the-air television broadcasters|local markets]] of the two participating teams. ESPN's Major League Baseball contract was not affected then, but would take a hit in [[1998 NFL season|1998]] with the new National Football League contract.

In 2012, Fox would revive the ''Baseball Night in America'' title (previously used for The Baseball Network's games) for a series of Saturday night games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FOX Hearkens Back to The Baseball Network With ‘Baseball Night in America’|url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2012/04/fox-hearkens-back-to-the-baseball-network-with-baseball-night-in-america/|work=Sports Media Watch|date=April 10, 2012|accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike The Baseball Network, Fox did not carry every game that was scheduled for a given Saturday, only choosing five to six games to distribute to its affiliates.

As far as the primary announce teams for The Baseball Network were concerned, they mostly went their separate ways. Al Michaels remained at ABC until 2006 (his final assignment for ABC Sports was [[Super Bowl XL]]), when he moved to NBC to become the voice of their [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday night NFL coverage]]. Tim McCarver joined Fox as its primary analyst alongside [[Joe Buck]] and stayed there until his retirement from national TV broadcasts in [[2013 World Series|2013]]. Jim Palmer, meanwhile, would rejoin the Orioles as [[List of Baltimore Orioles broadcasters|their television analyst]], where he still remains. 

NBC's primary crew remained in place for two more years. Bob Uecker would leave following the [[1997 World Series]], but Bob Costas and Joe Morgan would continue calling games until NBC's contract expired following the [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000 season]]. The network's final game to date was Game 6 of the [[2000 American League Championship Series]]. Costas has since become the lead broadcaster for [[MLB Network]] (as previously alluded towards, MLB Network's self-produced, live ''[[MLB Network Showcase|MLB Showcase]]'' telecasts could be seen as a [[spiritual successor]] to The Baseball Network's broadcasts), while Morgan kept working for ESPN until the end of the [[2010 Major League Baseball season|2010 season]].

It should also be noted that on July 8, 2011, the top two play-by-play men for The Baseball Network (who called the World Series for their respective networks 16 years prior), Al Michaels and Bob Costas teamed up (with the two announcers alternating between play-by-play and color commentary) to call a game between the [[2011 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] and [[2011 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] on MLB Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fangsbites.com/2011/06/al-michaels-bob-costas-to-call-game-for-mlb-network-in-july/ |title=Al Michaels &amp; Bob Costas To Call Game For MLB Network in July |author=Fang, Ken |date=June 29, 2011 |work=Fangsbites.com |publisher=Wordpress |accessdate=July 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704072147/http://fangsbites.com/2011/06/al-michaels-bob-costas-to-call-game-for-mlb-network-in-july/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Michaels' first appearance as a primary announcer on a baseball telecast since Game 5 of the [[1995 World Series]] on [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]]. (as previously mentioned, Michaels had called Games 1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=October 24, 1995|title=TV SPORTS;A Game of Finding Baseball on TV|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/24/sports/tv-sports-a-game-of-finding-baseball-on-tv.html?mcubz=1|work=New York Times|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, 4 and 5 of that series with [[Jim Palmer]] and [[Tim McCarver]], while Costas called Games 2, 3 and 6 with [[Joe Morgan]] and [[Bob Uecker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=October 15, 1995|title=SIGNOFF;World Series, as Told by Bob Uecker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/tv/signoff-world-series-as-told-by-bob-uecker.html?mcubz=1|work=New York Times|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]].) Michaels and Costas also made appearances on [[SportsNet New York]] and [[Comcast SportsNet Bay Area]] during the game's middle innings, since the MLB Network broadcast was [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blacked out]] in the Mets' and Giants' respective home markets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5935">'''Théodore Pescatore''' (6 February 1802 – 23 August 1878) was a [[Luxembourg]]ian politician.  One of the most important [[liberalism|liberals]] in the mid-19th century,&lt;ref name="Mersch 506"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 506&lt;/ref&gt; he was president of the [[Constituent Assembly of Luxembourg|Constituent Assembly]] that wrote [[Constitution of Luxembourg|Luxembourg's Constitution]] in 1848.  He later held the position of [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|President of the Chamber of Deputies]] for two years.

Pescatore studied law at the [[University of Liège]], but, instead of pursuing a career in the law, Pescatore attended a [[military academy]] in the [[Netherlands]], and, upon returning to Luxembourg, in 1827, he was recruited as a lieutenant into the guard of [[Luxembourg City]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 506" /&gt;  However, after three years, Pescatore's anti-[[Orangism (Luxembourg)|Orangist]] and pro-[[Belgium|Belgian]] political sympathies forced him out of the military.&lt;ref name="Mersch 506" /&gt;  Instead, he joined with his cousins to set up a [[faience]] factory in [[Eich, Luxembourg|Eich]], where his brother was mayor.&lt;ref name="Mersch 506" /&gt;  After seven years, they [[merger|merged]] into the ''Société d'industrie luxembourgeoise'',&lt;ref name="Mersch 506" /&gt; and Pescatore helped set up ''Auguste Metz &amp; Cie'' with [[Auguste Metz]] and his brothers [[Charles Metz|Charles]] and [[Norbert Metz|Norbert]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 550&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841, he was appointed to the 'Commission of Nine' in [[the Hague]] that advised the [[King-Grand Duke]] on the Luxembourgian issues, including the drafting of a constitution.&lt;ref name="Mersch 507"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 507&lt;/ref&gt;  From 30 October 1841, he was a member of the [[Assembly of Estates]] for [[Mersch (Chamber of Deputies constituency)|Mersch]], and entered the Commission of Government under the governor, [[Gaspard-Théodore-Ignace de la Fontaine]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 507" /&gt;  Pescatore was charged with negotiating a treaty on the terms of Luxembourg's membership of the [[Zollverein]], in place of F. H. W. de Scherff, who had fallen ill.&lt;ref name="Mersch 508"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected to the 1848 [[Constituent Assembly of Luxembourg|Constituent Assembly]], representing [[Luxembourg (Chamber of Deputies constituency)|Luxembourg canton]].  Appointed the first chair of the constituent assembly, he advocated heavy involvement with the [[Frankfurt Parliament]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 508" /&gt;  In the elections to the first [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]] after the promulgation of the constitution, Pescatore ran for Luxembourg canton, and found himself in the unique position of being top of the electoral lists of all three parties.&lt;ref name="Mersch 509"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 509&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite having been in government before 1848, he showed no interest in returning afterwards,&lt;ref name="Mersch 508" /&gt; and remained a legislator, being elected Vice-President of the Chamber in 1852, with Charles Metz as President.&lt;ref name="Mersch 509" /&gt;  With the death of Metz the following year, Pescatore became the new [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|President of the Chamber]], whilst the [[Jean-Jacques Willmar|Willmar]] government was replaced by one under [[Charles-Mathias Simons]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 509" /&gt;

With, however, the death of Auguste Metz in 1855, and the subsequent retirement of Charles Metz, the radicals that formed Pescatore's support base withered, and he was replaced as President of the Chamber by [[Victor de Tornaco]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 510"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;  He decided to resign as deputy, as well, but returned when reelected at the head of the liberals' list in Luxembourg canton on 30 November 1857.&lt;ref name="Mersch 510"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned as President of the Chamber, being elected by 21 votes to 3.&lt;ref name="Mersch 511"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;  He held this position until 1866, when he stood down as President, and he retired as a deputy in 1869.&lt;ref name="Mersch 512"&gt;Mersch (1949), p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;

Pescatore died on 23 August 1878 after a long illness.&lt;ref name="Mersch 512" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11565">A '''retention of title clause''' (also called a '''''Romalpa'' clause''' in some jurisdictions) is a provision in a contract for the sale of goods that the title to the goods remains vested in the seller until certain obligations (usually payment of the purchase price) are fulfilled by the buyer.

==Purpose==

The main purpose of retention of title ("ROT") clauses is to ensure that where goods are supplied on credit, if the buyer subsequently goes into [[bankruptcy]], the seller can repossess the goods. They are often seen as a natural extension of the credit economy; where suppliers are expected to sell goods on credit, there is a reasonable expectation that if they are not paid they should be able to repossess the goods.  Nonetheless, in a number of jurisdictions, insolvency regimes or credit arrangement regimes prevent title retention clauses from being enforced where doing so would upset administration of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], where an [[Administration (insolvency)|administration order]] is made with respect to a company, section 11 of the ''[[Insolvency Act 1986]]'' prevents goods being repossessed without the leave of the court.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retention of title clauses are mandated in the [[European Union]] by Article 9 of the [[Late Payments Directive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EU directive |serial= 2011/7/EU|year= |date= 16 February 2011|description = on combating late payment in commercial transactions (recast)|eurlextag= OJ:L:2011:048:0001:0010:EN:PDF}}, replacing Article 4 of {{cite EU directive |serial= 2000/35/EC|year= |date= 29 June 2000|description = on combating late payment in commercial transactions|eurlextag= OJ:L:2000:200:0035:0038:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sellers' ROT rights are recognized by Article 7 of the [[Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000|Insolvency Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EU regulation| serial= 1346/2000| date= 29 May 2000| description = on insolvency proceedings| eurlextag= OJ:L:2000:160:0001:0018:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially prevalent in [[Germany]],{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp=13{{endash}}15}} these clauses are permitted in the United Kingdom by s.19 of the ''[[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]'', which expanded upon the 1976 judgment of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] in ''[[Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1976] 1 WLR 676&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to English law,{{sfn|Bridge|Macdonald|Simmonds|Walsh|1999|p=633}} the common-law jurisdictions in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United States]] have instituted the concept of "[[security interest]]", under which ROT clauses may need to be registered in order to have effect:{{sfn|Duggan|2011|p=654}}

:* in the United States, states have adopted [[Secured transactions in the United States|Article 9]] of the ''[[Uniform Commercial Code]]'', which limits the clause's effectiveness{{sfn|Davies|2006|pp=15{{endash}}18}}
:* common-law provinces in Canada have adopted their ''[[Personal Property Security Act (Canada)|Personal Property Security Acts]]'' which operate similarly
:* in [[Quebec]], there is no "presumption of [[hypothec]]", and therefore an ROT clause is not considered to be a [[security interest]]; art. 1497 of the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]'' provides that "An obligation is conditional where it is made to depend upon a future and uncertain event,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|1497}}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives legal authority to such clauses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Peter J. Cullen|chapter = Canada|editor= Alexander von Ziegler|year= 2011|title= Transfer of Ownership in International Trade|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H5m9VatRGkkC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;ots=VCZ3hQQezh&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;f=false|page = 73|location= The Netherlands|publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Kluwer Law International BV]]|isbn= 978-90-411-3134-8|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Australia and New Zealand have also adopted their own versions of the ''[[Personal Property Securities Register|Personal Property Security Act]]''

==Legal analysis==
Although title retention clauses are conceptually very simple, they have become increasingly widely drafted, which has resulted in the courts in a number of countries striking down the clauses, or recharacterising them as the grant of a [[security interest]]. It has consequentially been noted that "the practical outcome of a series of later cases has put it beyond doubt that 'extended' title reservation clauses will not work."{{sfn|Bridge|Macdonald|Simmonds|Walsh|1999|p=639}}  Several particular problems have been identified:

:* If for example, the clause reserves only part of the title to the seller (instead of reserving title to the whole thing) then in many jurisdictions this is [[recharacterisation|recharacterised]] as an [[Security interest#Equitable charge|equitable charge]], and is often void if certain registration requirements are not complied with.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in England in ''Re Bond Worth Ltd'' [1980] Ch 228 such a clause was held to be void as it had not been registered within 21 days as required by section 395 of the [[Companies Act 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Problems can also arise where the goods sold are mixed with other goods of a similar nature, so that they are no longer identifiable (e.g. a quantity of oil, or grain).&lt;ref&gt;In most common law jurisdictions, so long as the clause prohibited mixing in this manner, the rule is that the buyer and the seller jointly own the whole mixture as [[Concurrent estate#Tenancy in common|tenants in common]], see ''[[Indian Oil v. Greenstone Shipping]]'' [1987] 3 WLR 869&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Many jurisdictions allow the buyer to re-sell the goods before title has passed to him (often this is the only way that he can pay the seller).  In many jurisdictions such an onward sale passes good title to the subsequent purchaser, and the original seller loses title despite the clause&lt;ref&gt;For example, in England this is the effect of section 25(1) of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]], and section 2(1) of the Factors Act 1889&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Where the seller tries to have a clause which provides that, if the buyer re-sells the goods, then the proceeds of sale of the goods shall be held on [[trust (law)|trust]] for the seller, this can be recharacterised as a registrable charge, which may also be void for non-registration.&lt;ref&gt;In England, see ''[[E Pfeiffer v. Arbuthnot Factors]]'' [1988] 1 WLR 150, although a differently worded clause was distinguished and upheld in ''[[Compaq Computer v. Abercorn]]'' [1991] BCC 484&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Another frequently litigated problem occurs where the goods which are subject to the clause are then either improved (e.g. raw thread is worked into cloth) or mixed with other raw materials to form a new product (e.g. silica is used to make glass).&lt;ref&gt;Generally speaking, in England, the law has been consistently applied that if the retention of title clause purports to apply to the new substance which has been made, then it takes effect as a charge and would be void if not registered, see for example, ''[[Re Peachdart]]'' [1984] Ch 131&lt;/ref&gt;
:* In some countries, where a clause purports to retain title until, not only the purchase price, but also any other debts of the buyer to the seller are paid in full, such clauses have been struck down for non-compliance with security registration requirements in those jurisdictions.

==Sample clauses==
Retention of title clauses will obviously vary from country to country, and even within countries they will usually be specialised to the form of industry used in, and the type of goods which are sold.  The following are just two examples of the types of clause which can be seen.

''A shorter form clause:''
:#Title to {''the Goods''} shall remain vested in {''the Seller''} and shall not pass to {''the Buyer''} until the purchase price for {''the Goods''} has been paid in full and received by {''the Seller''}.

''A longer form clause:''

:#Title to {''the Goods''} shall remain vested in {''the Seller''} and shall not pass to {''the Buyer''} until the purchase price for {''the Goods''} has been paid in full and received by {''the Seller''}.  Until title to {''the Goods''} passes:
:##{''the Seller''} shall have authority to retake, sell or otherwise deal with and/or dispose of all or any part of {''the Goods''};
:##{''the Seller''} and its agents and employees shall be entitled at any time and without the need to give notice enter upon any property upon which {''the Goods''} or any part are stored, or upon which {''the Seller''} reasonably believes them to be kept; 
:##{''the Buyer''} shall store or mark {''the Goods''} in a manner reasonably satisfactory to {''the Seller''} indicating that title to {''the Goods''} remains vested in {''the Seller''}; and
:##{''the Buyer''} shall insure {''the Goods''} to their full replacement value, and arrange for {''the Seller''} to be noted on the policy of insurance as the loss payee.
:#Irrespective of whether title to {''the Goods''} remains vested in {''the Seller''}, risk in {''the Goods''} shall pass to {''the Buyer''} upon delivery.

'''Unfair business practices''' encompass [[fraud]], [[misrepresentation]], and oppressive or [[unconscionability|unconscionable]] acts or practices by [[business]], often against [[consumer]]s and are prohibited by law in many countries. For instance, in the [[European Union]], each member state must regulate unfair business practices in accordance with the [[Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], subject to transitional periods. Unfair business practices may arise in many areas, including:
*[[leasing|Tenancy]] matters
*Matters involving the advertising and sale of products and services to consumers
*Matters involving [[insurance]] claims and the settlement thereof
*[[Debt collection]] in cases of [[default (finance)|default]]

In addition to providing for the award of compensatory [[damages]], laws may also provide for the award of punitive damages as well as the payment of the plaintiff's legal fees.

At [[common law]], individuals were not entitled to attorneys fees or punitive damages for wrongful acts committed by businesses in most states.  Most often, laws prohibiting unfair business practices require consumers to send a demand letter to the business prior to commencing with a lawsuit.  If the business fails to make a reasonable offer of settlement within a specified period of time, and is subsequently found liable in court, it may be liable for punitive damages and the injured parties reasonable attorney's fees under many statutes.  In some instances, the statutes provide for prevailing plaintiffs to recover double or triple the actual damages against non-settling defendants.  

When statutes prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices provide for the award of punitive damages and [[attorneys fee]]s to injured parties, they provide a powerful incentive for businesses to resolve the claim through the settlement process rather than risk a more costly judgment in court.

'''William John Young''' (February 27, 1827 at [[Belfast]], [[Ireland]] – June 8, 1896 at [[Clinton, Iowa|Clinton]], [[Iowa]]) was the founder of the W.J. Young Company.  He revolutionized the slow system of rafting logs by floatage with the current of the river in 1865 by a successful experiment of pushing log rafts ahead of a steam boat, independent of the river currents, and this with his introduction of the system of brail rafting, facilitated the movement of log stock while greatly lessening the expense of delivering them from the booms at Reef Slough and other points, to the mills at various points on the lower river; but for these advantages, the work of the mills would never have reached the vast volume to which they soon attained.  Mr. Young was one of the original members of the Mississippi River Logging Company, his interest in which he sold in 1893, after being for many years one of the most active and influential members of the company.

==Family==
He married Miss Esther Elderkin of [[Richmond, Indiana]] in 1858. They had six children.

==Early business years==
Few men have acquired equal prominence in the lumber circles of the northwest with that which was accorded to that pioneer lumberman of the Mississippi Valley, W.J. Young of [[Clinton, Iowa]].  Mr. Young came to America in 1846.  For several years he was employed in railroad offices and in ten years was given the position of general freight agent of the Cincinnati, Logansport &amp; Chicago railroad.  In 1858 he settled at [[Clinton, Iowa]], in the retail lumber business of what was then a rapidly developing village, and surrounding country.  About this time (see history of [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]) a company of capitalists who had erected a saw mill at La Crosse, became dissatisfied with the management of their representative at that place, and induced Mr. Young to go there and investigate the conditions of the business.  Upon his representations they decided not only to change their representative but to remove the mill to Clinton, and induced Mr. Young to take charge of the operation.

==Building his lumber business==
The machinery proved the nucleus of the vast mills and business, which but a few years later, brought Mr. Young's name and extensive operations into a prominence.  In 1860 a new mill was erected, which commenced operations in August.  In the statistical reports for 1873 the record shows there were two mills, built in 1867, with an estimated capacity of {{convert|50000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} yearly, operating two rotaries, eight gangs and five double edgers, employing 300 operators;. The cut of 1874 is stated at {{convert|29665000|board feet|m3}} of lumber and 17,295,000 shingles, that of 1875 being {{convert|35218000|board feet|m3}} of lumber and 14,470,000 shingles, showing a rapid evolution from the original mill of up to {{convert|8000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} per day while much larger, proved inadequate to the growing demands of his rapidly expanding operations.  In twenty years, Mr. Young had become proprietor of the largest saw mill in operation on the American continent.  In his earlier venture, the two Cincinnati men who had been connected with the La Crosse mill, and in whose interest it was removed to Clinton, were partners in the firm known as "W.J. Young &amp; Co.," but a few years later Mr. Young purchased their interests, and formed a connection with John McGraw of [[Ithaca, New York]], who was a member of the firm of Sage &amp; McGraw of [[Albany, New York]] and one of the largest lumbermen of the Allegheny region, and with large mills at Saginaw, and at [[Innisfil|Belle Ewart]], Canada, and in connection with him purchased much of the land of the [[Cornell University]] of Ithaca, which had been donated by the State of New York from a large grant of Wisconsin lands donated by the general government in aid of its school fund, and which comprised some of the best pine land of Wisconsin.  Under this arrangement the firm name of W.J. Young &amp; Co. was continued until the death of Mr. McGraw, as well as of his daughter Jennie McGraw Fisk, his beneficiary, who died a few years later, when Mr. Young purchased the interest of the estate, and continued the firm name, although being the only party in interest.

==Later lumber business development==
In 1880 the cut of Mr. Young's mills reached {{convert|50000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} of lumber and 20,000,000 shingles, of which {{convert|18000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} of lumber and 8,000,000 shingles was at the close of the season in pile on his yard, for the supply of his now greatly expanded trade, being seasoned before shipment over a vast territory extending in all directions.  The mills of 1892 reported a cut of {{convert|90234156|board feet|m3}} of lumber and 39,144,750 shingles, with a stock on hand at the close of the season of {{convert|47000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=2}} of lumber and 16,600,000 shingles, and at this time no mill in the world could vie with the "big mill" of Mr. Young.  Mr. Young was an invalid from 1893 to his death in 1896, the mills did not operate in 1895-6, and were subsequently run to be a modicum of their capacity, the cut of 1897 being recorded at but {{convert|10000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} of lumber, 2,000,000 shingles and 1,500,000 lath, a conservative estimate placing the total production since 1858 at {{convert|1700000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=2}} of lumber and 750,000,000 shingles.

==Other activities==
Mr. Young was active in banking.  He erected and presented to the Methodist denomination at Clinton, the beautiful "Esther Young Chapel."  He purchased and presented to the Young Men's Christian Association of Clinton a beautiful building.  His interest in educational matters was manifested also in liberal gifts to [[Cornell College]] at [[Mount Vernon, Iowa]].

He cared little for political honors, but in 1864 yielded to the almost unanimous call of the citizens of Clinton that he should take the mayoralty and the affairs of the city thrived under his administration.  He was for some time president of the Clinton Savings Bank, was a director of the Clinton National bank (http://www.clintonnational.com/).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3036">'''William Henry Davies''' (23 June 1831 – 21 April 1921) was a British-Canadian businessman. He established a business packing and shipping [[salt pork]] from [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] to the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[William Davies Company]] grew to be the largest pork packer in the [[British Empire]], giving Toronto its nickname of [[Name of Toronto|Hogtown]], and introducing [[peameal bacon]].

==Biography==
Davies was born in [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford, England]], the son of Charles Davies and Rachel Smallbone. He left school at 12 to become an apprentice. Within a decade, he had his own meat-curing and retail business in Reading, England. He married Emma Holtby in 1853 and two emigrated to Toronto in 1854. He started the William Davies Company in 1857. In 1860, he began exporting bacon to England. In 1864, he had his own building for cutting and smoking meats. In 1874, a new building was built near the mouth of the Don River. In 1892, he took on Joseph Wesley Flavelle as a partner in the business. The partnership flourished to the point where the business slaughtered 500,000 pigs per year and the two became millionaires. In 1909, Davies retired from the business, but retained a share of the company. In 1919, Davies' grandson Edward Carey Fox bought the company but it faltered and was merged into Canada Packers (now [[Maple Leaf Foods]]) in 1927.{{sfn|Bliss}}

Davies and Emma Holtby had twelve children. After Holtby died in 1906, Davies remarried in 1907 to Rosa Bessie Talbot. After his retirement in 1909, Davies tended to a farm in Markham, and later a farm in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough Township]]. He was a philanthropist, donating to [[McMaster University]], [[Brandon College]] and several hospitals that treated persons with [[tuberculosis]], an affliction his own sons had. William Davies died in 1921, after injuries sustained by being butted by a goat.{{sfn|Bliss}}

Once one of Canada's largest food producers, the William Davies Company not only graced its home city with the "Hogtown" nickname (or epithet), but William Davies also introduced [[peameal bacon]], which continues to be popular in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Lost"&gt;[http://www.lostrivers.ca/points/porkpacking.htm Points of Interest Along Lost Streams: Toronto Pork Packing Plant].
