During the '''[[2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]]''' of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the '''flag bearers''' of 207 [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs) arrived into [[Maracanã Stadium]]. The flag bearers from each participating country entered the stadium informally in single file, and behind them marched all the athletes without any distinction or grouping by nationality. The blending of all the athletes is a tradition that dates from the [[1956 Summer Olympics]], after a suggestion by Australian-born British student [[John Ian Wing]], who thought it would be a way of bringing the athletes of the world together as "one nation." The flags of each country were not necessarily carried by the same flag bearer as in the [[2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]].

==Countries and flagbearers==
The following is a list of each country's flag bearer. The list is sorted by the order in which each nation appears in the parade of nations. This table is sortable by country name in English, country name in Brazilian Portuguese, the flag bearer's name, or the flag bearer's sport. Names are given as were officially designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

'''Abdul Hakim''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الحكيم }}) is a Muslim male given name, and in modern usage, first name or surname. It is built from the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''Hakim''. The name means "servant of the All-wise", ''Al-Hakīm'' being one of the [[names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter ''a'' of the ''al-'' is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by ''e''. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part may appear as Hakim, Hakeem, or in other ways. The whole name is subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.

'''Adolph Huebsch''' (born in [[Sânnicolau Mare|St. Nicolaus]], Hungary, 18 September 1830; died in [[New York City]], 10 October 1884) was a Hungarian-American Hebrew scholar and [[rabbi]].

==Biography==
While a student, he participated in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian Revolution of 1848/9]]. After it was suppressed, he resumed his studies and officiated as rabbi in various towns. In 1861, he received the degree of [[Ph.D.]] from [[Prague University]], and preached in that city for a short time.

In 1866 he was called to New York City as rabbi of a synagogue, where he preached until his death. Huebsch was a [[Talmud]]ic and Semitic scholar of high attainments, a preacher of rare power, with a personality that charmed old and young. He was peculiarly successful in his ministry.

He published ''Gems from the Orient'', a selection of Talmudic and oriental proverbs, and a volume of his sermons and addresses was issued in 1885.

'''Amanda Crowe''' (July 16, 1928 – September 27, 2004) was an [[Eastern Band Cherokee]] woodcarver and educator from [[Cherokee, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=ramsey&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.heritagewnc.org/WNC_women/crowe_amanda.htm | title= Amanda Crowe | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090502165354/http://www.heritagewnc.org/WNC_women/crowe_amanda.htm |date=2009-05-02 | archive-date= 2009-05-02 |publisher = Ramsey Library |website = Women in Western North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A graduate of  the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], her work has been widely exhibited and is held by a number of museums.  Crowe dedicated much of her career to teaching and training the next generation of Eastern Cherokee artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.blueridgeheritage.com/artist/amanda-crowe |title = Historic Artist – Amanda Crowe |publisher =  Blue Ridge National Heritage Area|website=blueridgeheritage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Krause |first1= Bonnie J. | date = Spring–Summer 2012 |title= Passing on the Ancestors' Traditions: Amanda Crowe, Woodcarver and Teacher |url= https://digital.lib.ecu.edu/ncpi/view/19510 | journal = North Carolina Folklore Journal |volume= 59 |issue= 1 |pages= 59–71 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Crowe was born on July 16, 1928, in the [[Qualla Boundary]], North Carolina. By the age of four, she had decided to become an artist. Of her childhood, Amanda said: "Every spare minute was spent in carving or studying anything available concerning art ... "&lt;ref name="Power, 184"&gt;Power, 184&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of eight, she was already selling her carvings.&lt;ref name=ramsey/&gt;

Both of Crowe's parents died when she was very young. By the time she reached high school, her foster mother arranged for her to stay in Chicago, where she graduated from [[Hyde Park Academy High School|Hyde Park High School]] and attended the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC). She earned the [[John Quincy Adams]] fellowship for foreign study in 1952,&lt;ref name=ramsey/&gt; and she chose to study sculpture with [[Jose De Creeft]] at the [[Instituto Allende]] in [[San Miguel de Allende]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Power, 184" /&gt; Crowe also earned her Master of Fine Arts degree from SAIC that year.&lt;ref&gt;Leftwich, 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conley, 77"&gt;Conley, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and teaching career==
In 1953, the Cherokee Historical Association invited Crowe back to North Carolina to teach studio art at [[Cherokee High School (Cherokee, North Carolina)|Cherokee High School]], where her uncle [[Goingback Chiltoskey]] was already teaching. She set up a studio in the [[Paint Town, North Carolina|Paint Town]] community and taught wood carving for almost four decades to over 2,000 students.&lt;ref name="Power, 184" /&gt;

Her sculptures were often animal figures, and she was particularly known for her expressive bears. Her work is streamlined, highly stylized, and smoothly carved.&lt;ref&gt;Leftwich, 101–02&lt;/ref&gt; She also worked with stone and clay, but wood was her favorite medium, and she carved with local woods such as wild cherry, buckeye, and black walnut.&lt;ref name=ramsey/&gt;

Her art is sometimes compared to the work of [[Willard Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;Power, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Art scholar Esther Bockhoff writes that Crowe was "undoubtedly one of the primary influences on the resurgence of Cherokee carving."&lt;ref&gt;Power, 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Public collections that own her work include the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]], the [[United States Department of the Interior]], and the [[National Museum of the American Indian]]. She has exhibited her work in such museums as the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], the Atlanta Art Museum, the [[Denver Art Museum]], the [[Mint Museum of Art]] in Charlotte, the [[Asheville Art Museum]], and venues in Germany and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Conley, 77" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ash&gt;{{citebook | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160331140316/http://www.ashevilleart.org/exhibition/cherokee-carvers-tradition-renewed/ |title=  Cherokee Carvers: Tradition Renewed |publisher= Asheville Art Museum | date=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among many awards, Crowe won the [[North Carolina Folk Heritage Award]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb | title = People: Amanda Crowe (1928–2004) |url = https://www.wcu.edu/library/DigitalCollections/CherokeeTraditions/People/Carvers_AmandaCrowe.html |first  = Anna | last = Fariello

She also illustrated the book ''Cherokee Legends and the Trail of Tears'', first published in 1956 and reprinted several times since.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook | title = Cherokee Legends and the Trail of Tears | date = 1956 |publisher = Smithsonian Institution.

==Death and legacy==
Crowe died on September 27, 2004. Many of the contemporary Eastern Band Cherokee sculptors today studied under her.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{Cite web| url= https://www.newsweek.com/who-was-amanda-crowe-legendary-cherokee-woodcarver-celebrated-google-doodle-1208433 | first  = Aristos | last = Georgiou | title=  Who Was Amanda Crowe?

'''Anne Wentworth''' was a seventeenth-century English [[prophetess]] and writer. Although a poor woman, she found followers and a patron prepared to fund the publishing of her religious writing. She was separated from her husband; their unstable relationship being the cause of her prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;p.207, [[Jane Stevenson]], ''Women and the Cultural Politics of Printing''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Most of what is known about Anne Wentworth has been derived from her four extant texts, which are autobiographical in nature. They do not give specific details of her early life but do suggest that she was born into a [[Lincolnshire]] family between 1629 and 1630. 

==Career==
In 1652/1653, she married [[William Wentworth]] of London (Gill 115). In the late 1660s, Wentworth gave birth to a daughter (Taft). Several years later, around 1670, Wentworth experienced a restoration of faith in God after eighteen years in her unhappy marriage. After this "visitation" from God, Wentworth spent almost seven years writing and perfecting her craft, before publishing her first work, a pamphlet entitled, ''A True Account of Anne Wentworth's Being Cruelly, Unjustly, and Unchristianly Dealt with by Some of Those People Called [[Anabaptists]]'' (1676), more commonly referred to as ''A True Account of Anne Wentworth'' (Taft). In this piece, Wentworth reflects on the [[patriarchal]] domination of her husband, understanding it as punishment from God (Taft).

Despite the seven years it took for Wentworth to finally publish her first work, her life as a prophetess did not go unrecognized (Taft). Her [[husband]] and fellow Anabaptist comrades (today referred to as [[Baptist]]s) began to persecute Wentworth during this time as she expressed her prophetic voice. In 1675, it is unclear whether Wentworth was [[excommunicated]] from their [[Christian denomination|church]] after writing critiques on it (Gill 115) or whether she left it of her own [[free will]] (Taft); however, it is clear that the [[abuse]] from her husband and fellow Anabaptists intensified after she no longer belonged to their local church.

In 1677, Wentworth published ''A Vindication of Anne Wentworth'', another autobiographical work like ''A True Account'' that attempts to "justify her prophetic voice as genuine, narrate the persecution inflicted upon her because of her prophetic activity, and predict the imminent coming of the Apocalypse" (Taft). At this time, she also sent letters to King Charles II and the [[Lord Mayor of London]] relating the coming [[Apocalypse]] "before [[New Year's Day]], 1678" (Taft). This enraged her husband who enlisted the help of three of his cousins to remove Wentworth from her home in the summer of 1677 (Taft). And despite the decline in her popularity after her prophecy did not come true, Anne continued to write ''England's Spiritual Pill'', which "may have appeared in 1678, but its publication date is uncertain" (Taft) and ''The Revelation of Jesus Christ'', which was meant to record "the actual words Christ&amp;nbsp;... spoke to her" that incited her prophetic voice. This text also acts as proof that someone still supported her after 1678 due to the line, "Friend in love to Souls" that is recognized on the work's title page, recognizing the individual who financed its publication in 1679. That same year, Wentworth returned to her home.

After ''The Revelation of Jesus Christ'' however, no other texts have been uncovered written by Wentworth. Her voice fell silent and there is some speculation that she is the Anne Wentworth who went on to live "in St John's Court and was buried on 22 May 1693 at St James's Church, Clerkenwell" (Gill 115), but there is no confirmation on this.

During the time that Wentworth wrote, the fact that her pieces were published and she was recognized as a public figure of her community is astonishing. Her works not only spoke out against her husband but they were also religiously and politically charged—a dangerous combination for a woman of the time. Due to her departure from what was traditionally accepted behavior for women of her time, Wentworth's life was tainted by chaos and persecution. Despite this however, she persevered and was able to write and publish the work that was significant to her—a truly remarkable feat for a woman of her time.

==Selected works==

===''A True Account of Anne Wentworth'' (1676)===
''A True Account of Anne Wentworth'' was published in 1676. It was the first published work by Wentworth. Its full title is ''A True Account of Anne Wentworths Being cruelly, unjustly, and unchristianly dealt with by some of those people called Anabaptists''. It is a seventeen-page [[pamphlet]] that describes an account of her eighteen years spent with her suppressive husband. It is a fairly vague description of the actual abuses her husband acted against her but it does claim she came very close to death, caused by her husband's treatment, only to be saved by God. She also describes the threats and suppressing behavior of the fellow Anabaptists of her town. In her ''True Account'', Wentworth proclaims God as her one true savior and Christianity as the one true religion (Wentworth, Freeman). She describes leaving her heavenly husband for God as her Spiritual Bridegroom (Gillespie).

===''A Vindication of Anne Wentworth'' (1677)===
''A Vindication of Anne Wentworth'' published in 1677 was Wentworth's second work. In this pamphlet Wentworth goes into greater detail about her [[abuse]] by her husband and the Anabaptists. She also prophesizes the upcoming apocalypse God has promised. In ''A Vindication'' Wentworth states that she is not seeking [[revenge]] and hopes her husband will be saved himself. She ensures that she was an unwilling party in her writings and only by the fear of God's imminent power did she expose her husband's wrongdoings. Wentworth concludes with a poem about her mistreatment, her innocence, and the forthcoming apocalypse that will punish London for her [[sins]] (Wentworth, Freeman).

===''Englands Spiritual Pill'' (1679)===
Published in 1679, this is the last of Anne Wentworth's known works.  The complete title to this piece is ''ENGLANDS SPIRITUAL PILL Which will Purge, Cure, or Kill; DECLARING The Great and Wonderfull Things WHICH The Almighty and most High God JESUS CHRIST King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, Hath Revealed unto ANNE WENTWORTH CONCERNING A Through-Reformation of Church-worship, from all Hypocritical and [[Idolatrous]] Formalities, the downfall of [[Babylon]], and the finishing of her Testimony''.

Similar to ''A Revelation of Jesus Christ'', this piece too, deals with the encounters between Jesus Christ and Anne Wentworth.  She says that because of the success of her first book, she has a continued duty to enlighten people before the wrath of God is upon them.

===''A Revelation of Jesus Christ'' (1679)===
"Just as he spake it in Verses at several times, and sometimes in Prose, unto his Faithful Servant, Anne Wentworth, who suffereth for his Name" (Freeman 693).

''A Revelation of Jesus Christ'', published in 1679, is the text in which Wentworth records the conversations she had with Christ from 1677 to 1679.  Within the text she advises friends to awake and speak the truth of God, but it appears they seem doubtful of her prophecies, prompting Wentworth to write "For when the Lord of Life sends in love to warn you,/ Ye slight his Word, because his Voice ye never knew" (Freeman 701).  This launches the discussion between Wentworth and Christ about how the ignorant people around her will suffer when the end of the world arrives.

'''Carl August Röckel''' (1 December 1814 – 18 June 1876) was a German composer and conductor. He was a friend of [[Richard Wagner]] and active in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolutions of 1848]].

==Biography==
Röckel was born in [[Graz]]. His father, Joseph August Röckel, was a tenor, choir director and theatre entrepreneur who sang the role of Florestan at the premiere of the second version of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Fidelio]]'' in 1806. With his father, he experienced theatrical life in Vienna, Paris and London. He acted in Paris as assistant to [[Gioacchino Rossini]] at the [[Théâtre des Italiens]],&lt;ref name="Sqire"&gt;Squire and Deauville (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite book |title=Röckel, August |url=http://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl_9/199.pdf |language=German |accessdate=26 January 2013 |publisher=biographien.ac.at |format=PDF|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was on a later visit to Paris an eyewitness to the Paris [[July revolution|"July revolution" of 1830]].

After he completed his musical training with his uncle, [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]] (who was married to his father's sister [[Elisabeth Röckel]]), he was music director in [[Bamberg]] starting in 1838.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He lived in Vienna from 1839. For several years after 1840 he was conductor at the [[Deutsches Nationaltheater and Staatskapelle Weimar|Weimar Court Theatre]], where he composed his opera ''Farinelli''.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WagnerSalmi2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Luoma|first=Saila|title=Elämäni|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PntOxC4sm_8C&amp;pg=PA259|year=2002|publisher=Faros-kustannus Oy|isbn=978-951-98968-0-9|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1843 he came to [[Dresden]], where he was at the [[Semperoper#History|Court Theatre]], where Richard Wagner was music director. He was assistant conductor ("2. Musikdirektor") to Wagner for five years until 1848.&lt;ref name="Berry2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berry|first=Mark|title=Treacherous Bonds And Laughing Fire: Politics And Religion in Wagner's Ring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yiwWoCrHX7EC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5356-1|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pirna"&gt;{{cite web |title=Treacherous Bonds And Laughing Fire: Politics And Religion in Wagner's Ring|url=http://www.pirna.de/Persoenlichkeiten_Karl_August_Roeckel_-.4570d1486/ |language=German |accessdate=26 January 2013 |publisher=[[Pirna]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the music of Wagner, he renounced a performance of his own opera, which he had sent to Dresden. Wagner became a close friend, especially during the time of [[May Uprising in Dresden|1849 Dresden uprising]], and the two would go on long walks together.&lt;ref name="Szakolczai2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Szakolczai|first=Arpad|title=Comedy and the Public Sphere: The Rebirth of Theatre as Comedy and the Genealogy of the Modern Public Arena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MyQafg_PP4IC&amp;pg=PA267|date=12 December 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-62391-9|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Röckel was an ardent [[republicanism|Republican]]; he became friends with the likes of [[Michael Bakunin]] and was the editor of the revolutionary journal in Dresden, ''Volksblätter'',&lt;ref name="Sqire" /&gt; to which Wagner also contributed. After the failure of the uprising, Röckel was captured&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; along with Bakunin and sentenced to death, while Wagner escaped to Zurich. The death sentences were later commuted to prison terms. Whilst Bakunin was handed over to Russia, Röckel had to serve a thirteen-year sentence in solitary confinement at the [[Königstein Fortress]] and at [[Waldheim, Saxony|Waldheim]],&lt;ref name="Newman1946"/&gt; and was only released in January 1862, the last of the May insurgents to be freed.&lt;ref name="Pirna" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EwenWollock2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ewen|first1=Frederic|last2=Wollock|first2=Jeffrey L.|title=A Half-Century of Greatness: The Creative Imagination of Europe, 1848-1884|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46jjigokghcC&amp;pg=PA310|year=2007|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-2236-7|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in custody, he received many letters from Wagner, in which Wagner made insightful statements on his opera cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', which give valuable background to the revolutionary and socially critical nature of Wagner's magnum opus. During detention Rockel wrote his book ''The Saxon Revolt and the  Waldheim Penitentiary''. In 1862 in [[Biebrich (Wiesbaden)|Biebrich]] he once more met Wagner, who at that time was living there, writing ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''. However Wagner later quarrelled with Röckel when, in the late 1860s, he believed that the latter had been gossiping about his relationship with [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima von Bülow]].&lt;ref name="Sqire" /&gt;

Röckel lived in [[Frankfurt]] from 1863. In 1866 he moved to [[Munich]], and later in Vienna. In 1871 he suffered a stroke from which he never recovered.&lt;ref name="Newman1946"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Ernest|title=The Life of Richard Wagner 1848-1860|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S01_DraCD-gC|year=1946|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finally died after a long illness at the house of his son in [[Budapest]].

{{Nihongo|'''Bankei Yōtaku'''|盤珪永琢|extra= 1622-1693}} was a Japanese [[Rinzai]] [[Zen]] master, and the abbot of the Ryōmon-ji and Nyohō-ji.  He is best known for his talks on the ''[[Anutpada|Unborn]]'' as he called it. According to [[D. T. Suzuki]], Bankei, together with [[Dogen]] and [[Hakuin]], is one of the most important Japanese Zen masters and his Unborn Zen is one of the most original developments in the entire history of Zen thought.&lt;ref&gt;''Waddell.'' preface vii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early years===
Bankei Yōtaku was born in 1622, in [[Harima Province]] to a [[samurai]] turned medicine man named Suga Dosetsu. His boyhood name was Muchi. Bankei's mother bore the last name of Noguchi, and little more is known of her, other than that the society of the time extolled her as 'Maya who begot three Buddhas,' - Maya being the mother of the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni. Bankei had four brothers and four sisters. His eldest brother, Masayasu, was a skilled physician and his second eldest brother was a practitioner of the Pure Land school of Buddhism. Hence Bankei's mother was likened to Maya, Masayasu to Yakushi - the Buddha of healing, his second eldest brother to the Buddha Amida, and Bankei himself to Shakyamuni Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;「盤珪禅師逸話選」（1998：5）禅文化研究所&lt;/ref&gt; Bankei was a rebellious and mischievous child, though he showed remarkable intelligence. When Bankei was 11, his father died, and in the following year he entered school.

===Start of search===
Here he was taught many of the [[Confucian]] texts. At this time, Bankei was young and full of questions and the Confucian classics he was being taught confused him greatly. One day, the teacher read the first line from '[[Great Learning]]': "The way of great learning lies in clarifying bright virtue." Bankei entered a heated exchange with his teacher imploring them for the meaning of this. Bankei felt no satisfactory answers were given.

This gap in Bankei's understanding gave birth to many doubts and questions, and so he seized most every chance to question others on their knowledge. He would implore Confucian and Buddhist scholars and attend various religious gatherings in search of answers. All of this, however, proved futile for him. He became so distraught in his need to find answers that school was no longer a priority for him, and in 1633 he was kicked out of his family home. A friend of his family, Yūkan Nakahori, allowed Bankei to stay in a small hut nearby. Being a bit [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], Bankei etched into a slat of wood "Practice [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]" and placed it outside of his little hut.

===Buddhist training===
It is likely that Bankei began practicing [[Shin Buddhism]] during this time. It is known that when Bankei was 15 he trained at a [[Shingon]] temple, where he apparently gained some footing in [[sutra]] study. However, Bankei was not satisfied with the Shingon approach and left that following year. At 16 he walked from Hamada to Ako to see a Rinzai Zen priest named [[Umpo Zenjo]] at [[Zuiō-ji]]. Bankei wasted no time with Umpo and implored him on the meaning of bright virtue, to which Umpo advised the only path toward such understanding could be had through the practice of [[zazen]]. Bankei was intrigued by this advice and ordained as a monk at Zuiō-ji under Umpo. It was here he received his Buddhist name Yōtaku (meaning 'Long Polishing of the Mind Gem').

When Bankei turned 19 he left [[Zuiō-ji]] shortly after and travelled through [[Kyoto]], [[Osaka]] and [[Kyūshū]] in search for an answer to his question. During his travels he would stay over at temples or sleep in the open wilderness, scrounging by as a beggar. In 1645, at age 24, Bankei returned to Zuiō-ji no wiser than the day he left. At this time Umpo informs him that the answer which he seeks can only be found within, not through an intermediary. Bankei left shortly after his return and built a small hut nearby and lived as a [[hermit]]. He would sit for hours practicing zazen. He had given up bodily comfort and had no other goal during this time aside from coming to a complete understanding of things. He practiced this way for many years, but eventually the bodily neglect caused him to contract [[tuberculosis]]. He sought the care of a doctor who gave the prognosis of death.

===Realizing the Unborn===
It was during this near-death experience that Bankei [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|realized]] the [[Anutpada|Unborn]], later stating of the experience:
{{quote|I felt a strange sensation in my throat. I spat against a wall. A mass of black phlegm large as a soapberry rolled down the side...Suddenly, just at that moment...I realized what it was that had escaped me until now: ''All things are perfectly resolved in the unborn''.&lt;ref&gt;''Waddell.'' 10, 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following this breakthrough his doubt and questioning ceased while his physical condition turned for the better. Once strong enough to travel again, he returned to Umpo to relay his experience to him. Umpo confirmed his enlightenment. He sent Bankei off to have his understanding further evidenced by [[Gudō Toshoku]], another Rinzai master.

===Seeking confirmation===
At the age of 26 Bankei went to [[Gifu Prefecture]] to [[Daisen-ji]] where Gudo was [[abbot]]. However, when Bankei arrived Gudo was attending to another temple of his in the countryside. So Bankei visited the temples of other Zen teachers in the area, none of which had priests with the proper understanding themselves to confirm his understanding. After a year living in the countryside near Daisen-ji, Bankei travelled back to Umpo once again. In 1651, Bankei heard that a [[Ch'an]] master had arrived in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] by the name of [[Dosha Chogen]]. Umpo advised he go see the Ch'an master, and Bankei set off for Nagasaki hoping to finally have his enlightenment confirmed.

Bankei found Dosha Chogen at [[Sōfuku-ji (Gifu)|Sōfuku-ji]], a Chinese style temple. Dosha confirmed Bankei's understanding on their first meeting, but also informed Bankei that his understanding was incomplete. Bankei was offended by this initially and refused to accept it. Yet he stayed at the temple for a bit to observe Dosha's ways, eventually realizing what Dosha had insisted was true. So Bankei stayed on at Sōfuku-ji practicing under Dosha.

===Final awakening===
While Bankei lived among the other monks at the temple, he refused to chant the sutras with them in Chinese. In 1652, while meditating with the congregation, Bankei experienced final awakening. Dosha confirmed this the next day, stating Bankei had finally settled the Great Matter. Bankei then refused a senior position in the monastery, preferring his unassuming existence instead working in the kitchen. The following year Bankei returned to Harima for a short while, and then left for [[Yoshino District, Nara|Yoshino]] in the [[Nara Prefecture]] to live again as a hermit. In the mountains of Yoshino, Bankei authored some Buddhist chants pertaining to the Unborn while living there in silent retreat.

==Teachings==

===The Unborn===
{{Main|Anutpada}}

The Unborn (Japanese ''fushō'') is a Sanskrit term, ''anutpāda'':
* "An" means "not", or "non"
* "Utpāda" means "genesis", "coming forth", "birth"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=utpAda&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Utpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together "anutpāda" means "having no origin", "not coming into existence", "not taking effect", "non-production".&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=anutpAda+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, ''Anutpāda'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist tradition uses the term "anutpāda" for the absence of an origin{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Bhattacharya|1943|p=49}} or [[sunyata]].{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=160}} The term is also used in the [[Lankavatara Sutra]], where it is equated with [[sunyata]].{{sfn|Suzuki|1999}} According to D.T Suzuki, "anutpada" is not the opposite of "utpada", but transcends opposites. It is the [[Kensho|seeing into the true nature of existence]],{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=123-124}} the seeing that "all objects are without self-substance".{{sfn|Suzuki|1999|p=168}}

The full phrase is ''fushō fumetsu'', "unborn and undying",{{sfn|Ryoen|1999|p=297}} or "no creation and no annihilation",{{sfn|Ryoen|1999|p=297}} but in later years Bankei only used the term "unborn", since Bankei thought it logically impossible to say that something which has not been created is being destroyed, rendering the term "undying" redundant.{{sfn|Ryoen|1999|p=297}} However, it certainly is not logically impossible for something which has always existed to cease existing, hence the necessity of employing both terms.

===Attaining the Unborn===
Although the Unborn is the natural state of man{{refn|group=note|See also [[Sahaja]] and [[Rigpa]]}}, "self-criticism" rather than [[zazen]] or [[koan]]s are needed to liberate the self from illusion and dualistic thoughts and fixations (''nen'').{{sfn|Ryoen|1999|p=301}} According to Bankei, illusion arises through "selfish desire", and ''nen'' are "images of things seen and heard".{{sfn|Ryoen|1999|p=301-302}} By detaching from those illusions and fixations, 
{{quote|neither trying to prevent them nor trying to encourage further thought [...] they will certainly stop of themselves."{{sfn|Ryoen|1999|p=302}}{{refn|group=note|This resembles [[Vipassanā|vipassana-meditation]] and Krishnamurti's [[choiceless awareness]]}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3395">'''Charles C. Carson, Sr.''' (August 19, 1925 – August 8, 2002) was a civilian [[mortician]] for the [[United States Air Force]] and the namesake of the [[Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs]]. The street on which the mortuary resides is also named in his honor.

==Personal==
Carson was the son of the late Charles Carter and Alice Snow Carson in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].  He attended [[Alabama State High School]] and graduated from [[Tennessee State University]] to enable him to achieve a lifelong ambition to steady the uneasiness of and provide comfort to individuals and families experiencing the pain and agony accompanying the loss of a loved one. Carson married the former Virginia Lewis, his hometown sweetheart, in 1950.  They became parents of two sons and three daughters.

==Work==
Carson earned a license in mortuary science from [[Atlanta College of Mortuary Science]] in 1950 and began his career that same year as a manager with Smith and Gaston Funeral Home of Montgomery, Alabama.  He served in a similar capacity with Gaston offices in [[Tuskegee]] and [[Mobile, Alabama]].

A distinguished federal career as a civilian mortician began with the [[Department of the Air Force]] in 1958.  He was the deputy mortuary officer at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]], [[Republic of Vietnam]] and [[Clark Air Force Base]] in the [[Philippines]] from 1964 to 1970.

During the early part of the [[Vietnam War]], he covered mortuary affairs in [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Hong Kong]].  He also administered mortuary contracts in [[New Guinea]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]].  Examples of his involvement in disasters in Southeast Asia are the naval disasters aboard the {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}} in 1966, the {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}} in 1967 and the Vietnam [[Tet Offensive]].  Carson had supervised mortuary preparation of remains in every major disaster involving American military and civilian personnel since 1971.

He was assigned to [[Dover Air Force Base]] August 1970 as a mortuary inspector and was promoted to Chief Port Mortuary Officer a year later.  Carson applied his skills in a number of disasters, including the Tet Offensive in Vietnam and the [[Jonestown Massacre|Jonestown cult mass suicide]] in [[Guyana]], Tenerife-Canary Islands at the request of the State Department; he served as technical advisor to the Wing and Group Commanders for mortuary affairs.  He also supervised the processing of the remains of victims in the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']] mission and [[Desert Storm]] as well as the [[1996 Croatia USAF CT-43 crash|air plane disaster]] that claimed the life of then Secretary of Commerce [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

He retired in 1996 and died August 8, 2002.&lt;ref name="defenselink"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dover's New Mortuary Center Aims to Ease Family's Grief| url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=28223 |first=K.L. |last=Vantran |publisher=[[American Forces Press Service]]| location=Washington, D.C. |date= October 29, 2003 |accessdate=20 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Cloud Strife'''|クラウド・ストライフ|Kuraudo Sutoraifu|lead=yes}} is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] and the main [[protagonist]] of [[Square (company)|Square]]'s (now [[Square Enix]]'s) 1997 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' and several of its [[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII|sequels and spin-offs]]. In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a [[mercenary]] claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite [[supersoldier]]s employed by the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a [[megacorporation]] responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group [[AVALANCHE]], and driven by a feud with the primary [[antagonist]], [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader. Cloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] sequel film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a sickness that infected his body. He acts in a supporting role in other ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' titles, and is featured in several other games outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, and the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series by Square Enix.

Cloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. [[Yoshinori Kitase]], director of ''VII'', and [[Kazushige Nojima]], one of the game's event planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After ''VII'', Nomura assumed greater responsibility over Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style. Cloud's appearance is marked by spiky blond hair, striking blue eyes, dark clothing and his {{nihongo|Buster Sword|バスターソード|Basutā Sōdo}}; the sword previously belonged to his friend, [[Zack Fair]]. He stands 173&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (Revised Edition) |year=2009 |isbn=978-4-7575-2560-3|language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix |pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5&amp;nbsp;ft 8 in) tall.

Cloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as "iconic", Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games and as one of its first [[unreliable narrator]]s. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Guinness]]'', and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as trope for other characters, most notably [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and jewelry.

==Concept and creation==
{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That's one of the game's main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel. He isn't a straightforward hero like [[Superman]]; rather, he has many mysteries, self-doubts, and a real dark side. Mr. Nomura was also very good at designing a character like that.|source=—Yoshinori Kitase, ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', October 2005&lt;ref name="egm" /&gt;}}
Cloud's character was made to contrast the cast of the previous game, ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'', which had no main character. As result Yoshinori Kitase commented Cloud was designed to be the game's protagonist during early development of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shmuplations.com/ff7/|title=Final Fantasy VII – 1997 Developer Interviews|publisher=Shumplations|accessdate=April 13, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923162806/http://shmuplations.com/ff7/|archivedate=September 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptualized as one of only three playable characters in early planning stages for the game,&lt;ref name="egm" /&gt; Cloud was one of the first two characters designed for ''Final Fantasy VII'' by Tetsuya Nomura.&lt;ref name="8-13"/&gt; Nomura worked to strike an orthodox balance of varied designs for the game. Because he only started receiving character profiles prior to composing their appearances during later game productions, Nomura thought of the characters' stories first before tackling their designs.&lt;ref name="8-13" /&gt; Nomura's first draft of Cloud featured slicked-back, black hair. The depiction served both as a contrast to the long silver hair of the game's chief antagonist, Sephiroth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=McLaughlin, Rus | date=April 30, 2008 | title=IGN Presents: The History of Final Fantasy VII | url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/870/870770p1.html | publisher=Ziff Davis | website=IGN | accessdate=August 15, 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917074604/http://retro.ign.com/articles/870/870770p1.html | archivedate=September 17, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to minimize the model's [[polygon]] count.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=May 31, 2012|title=|script-title=ja:デザイナーが語る『FFVII』|url=|journal=Shūkan Famitsū|language=Japanese|publisher=Enterbrain|issue=1224|pages=56–57|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to make Cloud stand out more and emphasize his role as the game's lead protagonist, Nomura altered Cloud's design to give him spiky, bright blond hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&amp;more=1| title = Tetsuya Nomura's 20s| publisher = Flare Gamer| access-date = 26 February 2016| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6lqGKlEBK?url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&amp;more=1| archivedate = November 7, 2016| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in particular influenced the look of their swords.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Early renditions of Cloud's weapon, the Buster Sword, depicted a smaller blade.&lt;ref name="famitsutribute" /&gt; Its size grew over the course of several revisions, and Nomura called it "the Giant Kitchen Knife", envisioning it as unrefined steel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files| publisher = Square Enix| year = 2006| isbn = 4-7973-3498-3| editor-last = SoftBank| page = 7| language = Japanese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomura stated the Buster Sword was originally going to look like a Western sword while body was more built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/03/09/nomura-final-fantasy-vii-remake-kingdom-hearts-iii-clouds-design-never/|title=Nomura On Final Fantasy VII Remake, Kingdom Hearts III, And Cloud’s Design That Never Was|publisher=Siliconera|date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sword at one point featured a small chain connected to the pommel, while magnets would secure the blade to Cloud's back.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; More deeply involved with Cloud's creation than with other characters' from previous ''Final Fantasy'' projects,&lt;ref name="egm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interivew with Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura from Electronic Gaming Monthly, issue #196, October 2005. |url=http://www.ff7citadel.com/press/int_egm.shtml |publisher=Final Fantasy VII Citadel |date=October 2005 |work=Electronic Gaming Monthly |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011164522/http://ff7citadel.com/press/int_egm.shtml |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomura also provided supervision over Cloud's personality traits.&lt;ref name="twointerview"/&gt;

Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima developed Cloud's backstory and his relationship to Sephiroth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = FFVII Not Being Remade – Nomura.| url = http://ps3.ign.com/articles/793/793956p1.html| publisher = Ziff Davis| website = IGN| date = June 4, 2008| accessdate = July 5, 2008| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/64tTfaPsl?url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/793/793956p1.html| archivedate = January 23, 2012| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for Cloud's false persona arose after Nojima saw event planner [[Motomu Toriyama]]'s standing animation depicting "Cloud showing off", which impressed him and inspired the basis for the scenario.&lt;ref name="8-13" /&gt; Nojima created the character of Zack so as to expand upon the mysteries in Cloud's backstory. Kitase remained unaware of the addition's significance until [[playtest]]ing, as Nojima left the unfolding of events concerning Cloud's identity unwritten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=May 31, 2012|title=|script-title=ja:デイレクターが語る『FFVII』|url=|journal=Shūkan Famitsū|language=Japanese|publisher=Enterbrain|issue=1224|pages=54–55|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In emphasizing Cloud's individuality, the staff made repeated use of elements that they believed made the character interesting, such as Cloud's phrase "not interested" and Toriyama's standing animation. Kitase felt Cloud's character was fresh in reviewing Nojima's scenario, observing that he possessed an atypical personality for a hero by being neither single-minded nor righteous. The love triangle between Cloud, Tifa and Aerith was also viewed as novel for the series, and Nojima likened Cloud's relationship to Tifa as one of childhood friends since nursery school, whereas Aerith was akin to a transfer student arriving mid-term.&lt;ref name="8-13" /&gt;

In early drafts, Cloud would act as an [[alter ego]] for Sephiroth, influenced to believe he was a creation of Sephiroth's will. As in the finished game, Cloud would later realize that he is the real Cloud, and that the reason Sephiroth could control his mind and body was because of his weakened will and Shinra's experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | isbn=4-7575-1520-0 | pages=528–529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Cloud would have scarred Tifa prior to the game's events, although the reasons for as to why were unknown.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Ω | language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix | isbn=4-7575-1520-0 | page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early materials listed Cloud's [[Character class|job]] as {{nihongo|magic swordsman|魔法剣士|mahō kenshi}} and {{nihongo|berserker|バーサーカー|bāsākā}}.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; [[Masato Kato]], one of the event planners, proposed a scene involving Cloud walking out of the Highwind's [[Chocobo]] stable followed by Tifa the morning before the final battle. Kitase rejected it as too extreme, but maintained a scene written by Kato depicting the night before, in which a risqué line is spoken by Tifa followed by a [[Fade (lighting)|fade to black]]. In an interview, Nojima stated that none of the staff thought it would become an important issue at the time.&lt;ref name="8-13"&gt;{{cite book |title=Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (Revised Edition) |year=2009 |isbn=978-4-7575-2560-3 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix |pages=8–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nojima has explained that the relationship between the player and the main character in a ''Final Fantasy'' title is a dynamic he has always been concerned about. With ''VII'', Cloud's subdued nature led him to write scenes with the character in such a way that the players would be placed in the position of deciding for themselves what the character was thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2002 |title=Beyond Final Fantasy |medium=DVD |publisher=Square |language=Japanese, English |minutes=14 |chapter=The Creators: Event}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cloud's foggy memories served both to help players "become" the character, and to introduce them to a world which other inhabitants would otherwise share common knowledge of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.glitterberri.com/final-fantasy-vii/nojima-interview/|title = Nojima Interview|date = June 1, 2011|accessdate = January 9, 2016|website = GlitterBerri's Game Translations|publisher = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126195855/http://www.glitterberri.com/final-fantasy-vii/nojima-interview/|archivedate = January 26, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomura believes that the reason Cloud has become so popular with audiences is due to the impact his personality made in Nojima's scenario.&lt;ref name="famitsutribute"/&gt;

In retrospective, the Square Enix staff commented that Cloud is a "dorky" person in contrast to being a serious character. As a result, the former will be more focused on in the remake of ''Final Fantasy VII''. His design was briefly altered but Square Enix stated it will be close to the original design Nomura created for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2018/02/07/final-fantasy-vii-remake-changed-clouds-design-nomura-says-closest-original/|title=Final Fantasy VII Remake Changed Cloud’s Design, Nomura Says It Is Closest To The Original|publisher=Siliconera|date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an early event from ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud crossdresses in order to find Tifa. Nomura noted fans found this event was popular within the fans and reassured the remake will keep this part. On the other hand, the character designer stated that their final design was not decided yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://gamerant.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-feature-cross-dress-315/ |title= Final Fantasy 7 Remake Will Feature the Cross-Dressing Scene |publisher=GameRant |accessdate= March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further development===
Nomura redesigned Cloud for his appearance in ''Kingdom Hearts''. He is depicted with a claw and a crimson cape, and the blade of his sword is wrapped in bandages. Stating that Cloud's left arm was inspired by [[Vincent Valentine]], Nomura explained that he wanted to give the character a more [[demon]]-like appearance due to his ties to the dark side in the game.&lt;ref name="kh"&gt;{{cite book| title=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania: Revised Edition| publisher=Square Enix| location=Japan| language=Japanese| isbn=4-7575-1349-6| year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomura stated that he wanted to leave the question of whether Cloud was searching for Aerith open to the player's interpretation.&lt;ref name="kh"/&gt; Teruaki Sugawara, the game's voice director, recommended [[Takahiro Sakurai]], Cloud's Japanese voice actor, to Nomura for the role.&lt;ref name="rf" /&gt; Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of video game ''[[The Bouncer (video game)|The Bouncer]]'', Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing him speak.&lt;ref name="rf" /&gt; Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording under the impression that he would be voicing a different character than the one featured in ''Final Fantasy VII''.&lt;ref name="InteSakurai" /&gt;

For ''Advent Children'', Nomura agreed to direct the project largely because of his attachment to the character of Cloud.&lt;ref name="twointerview"&gt;{{cite web| title = Interivew with Kazushige Nojima and Tetsuya Nomura from FLAREgamer.| url = http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=109&amp;more=1| publisher=FLAREgamer| date = October 10, 2005 | accessdate = July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nomura stated that Cloud was a more positive character in ''Final Fantasy VII'' than in ''Advent Children'', he did not believe that such an "'upbeat' image of him is what stuck in the minds of the fans", and the script was written to explain why Cloud returned to a state of mind "consistent with the fans' view of him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files| publisher = Square Enix| year = 2006| isbn = 4-7973-3498-3| editor-last = SoftBank| page = 6| language = Japanese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomura describes Cloud's life as peaceful but, hurt by the losses he experienced during the original game, one which he grew scared of losing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2005 |title=Distance |medium=DVD featurette |publisher=Square Enix |language=Japanese |minutes=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blaming himself for things outside of his control, Cloud, Nomura elaborated, needed to overcome himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2005 |title=Distance |medium=DVD featurette |publisher=Square Enix |language=Japanese |minutes=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to other heroes, who, in Nomura's view, typically possess character defects amounting only to quirks, Nomura believed Cloud's weakness to be humanizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2005 |title=Distance |medium=DVD featurette |publisher=Square Enix |language=Japanese |minutes=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nojima viewed the theme of the story as one of forgiveness, which he believed required hardship. Cloud, by taking up his sword and fighting, struggles to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2005 |title=Distance |medium=DVD featurette |publisher=Square Enix |language=Japanese |minutes=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nojima sought to establish Cloud's withdrawn personality by depicting him with a cell phone, but never answering any calls.

Nomura sought to make Cloud's design "distinctly different from the other characters."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; About thirty different designs were made for Cloud's face, and his hair was altered both to give it a more realistic look and to illustrate that two years had passed since the game's conclusion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files| publisher = Square Enix| year = 2006| isbn = 4-7973-3498-3| editor-last = SoftBank| page = 16| language = Japanese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff attempted rendering Cloud based on the game's original illustrations, but concluded that doing so left his eyes unrealistically big, which "looked gross."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files| publisher = Square Enix| year = 2006| isbn = 4-7973-3498-3| editor-last = SoftBank| page = 73| language = Japanese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further revisions were made to Cloud's face after completion of the pilot film, which featured a more realistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files| publisher = Square Enix| year = 2006| isbn = 4-7973-3498-3| editor-last = SoftBank| page = 75| language = Japanese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to his hair, Cloud's clothes were difficult to make in the film.&lt;ref name="prologue"&gt;{{cite book |title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Prologue |year=2005 |isbn=4-08-779339-7 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding to give Cloud a simple costume consistent with the concept of "clothes designed for action", the staff began with the idea of a black robe, eventually parring it down to a "long apron" shifted to one side.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Cloud's weaponry was based on the joking observation that because his sword in the original game was already enormously tall, in the sequel, he should use sheer numbers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files| publisher = Square Enix| year = 2006| isbn = 4-7973-3498-3| editor-last = SoftBank| page = 68| language = Japanese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as {{nihongo|"The Fusion Swords"|合体剣|Gattai Ken}} during the film's development,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files| publisher = Square Enix| year = 2006| isbn = 4-7973-3498-3| editor-last = SoftBank| page = 78| language = Japanese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; early storyboard concepts included Cloud carrying six swords on his back,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; although the idea was later modified to six interlocking swords.

As development continued, the bike got bigger, with Takeya feeling its heaviness provided an impact that worked well within the film.&lt;ref name="making"&gt;{{cite video| people = Tetsuya Nomura (Director)| date = April 25, 2006 | title = Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Distance: The Making of Advent Children| medium = DVD| publisher=Square Enix| time =|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes expanded in the [[director's cut]] ''Advent Children Complete'' include Cloud's development with links to other ''Final Fantasy VII'' related media where he appeared.&lt;ref name="JSblood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/09/22/tgs07-advent-children-gets-dirty-on-blu-ray/ |date=September 22, 2007 |last=Yoon |first=Andrew |title=TGS07: Advent Children gets dirty on Blu-ray |work=[[Joystiq]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629204519/http://www.joystiq.com/2007/09/22/tgs07-advent-children-gets-dirty-on-blu-ray/ |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further focus on Cloud's [[character arc|growth]], Square decided to give him more scenes when he interacts with children. Additionally, the fight between Cloud and Sephiroth was expanded by several minutes, and includes a scene in which Sephiroth impales Cloud on his sword and holds him in the air, mirroring the scene in the game where he performs the same action. The decision to feature Cloud suffering for blood loss in the fight was made in order to make the character's pain feel realistic.&lt;ref name="famitsu"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Famitsu]] |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete |language=Japanese |date=March 2009 |pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice actors===
[[File:Sakurai Takahiro from "Genocidal Organ" at Opening Ceremony of the Tokyo International Film Festival 2016 (33260300820).jpg|thumb|Takahiro Sakurai has voiced Cloud ever since ''Kingdom Hearts'' in 2002]]
&lt;nowiki/&gt;For ''Advent Children'', Nomura wanted to contrast Cloud and Vincent's voices given their similar personalities.&lt;ref name="nother"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2006 | editor=SoftBank | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files | language=Japanese, English | publisher=Square Enix | isbn= 4-7973-3498-3| page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a sequel to the highly popular ''Final Fantasy VII'', Sakurai felt greater pressure performing the role than he did when he voiced Cloud for ''Kingdom Hearts''. Sakurai received comments from colleagues revealing their love of the game, some of them jokingly threatening that they would not forgive Sakurai if he did not meet their expectations.&lt;ref name="InteSakurai" /&gt; During recording, Sakurai was told that "[n]o matter what kind of odds are stacked against him, Cloud won't be shaken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files|publisher=Square Enix|year=2006|isbn=4-7973-3498-3|editor-last=SoftBank|page=13|language=Japanese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakurai says that while he recorded most of his work individually, he performed alongside [[Ayumi Ito]], who voiced Tifa, for a few scenes. These recordings left him feeling "deflated", as the "exchanges he has with Tifa can be pretty painful", Sakurai commenting that Cloud—whom he empathized with as his voice actor—has a hard time dealing with straight talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files|publisher=Square Enix|year=2006|isbn=4-7973-3498-3|editor-last=SoftBank|pages=13–14|language=Japanese, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakurai says that there were scenes that took over a year to complete, with very precise directions being given requiring multiple [[take]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2005 |title=Distance |medium=DVD featurette |publisher=Square Enix |language=Japanese |minutes=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Sakurai, Cloud's silence conveys more about the character than when he speaks. While possessing heroic characteristics, Sakurai describes Cloud's outlook as negative, and says that he is delicate in some respects.&lt;ref name="InteSakurai" /&gt; A fan of ''VII'', Sakurai had believed Cloud to be a colder character based on his original impression of him, but later came to view him as more sentimental.&lt;ref name="rf" /&gt; After the final product was released, Sakurai was anxious to hear the fans' response, whether positive or negative, and says that most of the feedback he received praised him.&lt;ref name="InteSakurai" /&gt; While recording ''Crisis Core'', Sakurai felt that Cloud, though still introverted, acted more like a normal teenager, and modified his approach accordingly. Cloud's scream over Zack's death left a major impression on Sakurai, who says that he worked hard to convey the emotional tone of the ending.&lt;ref name="InteSakurai" /&gt; Sakurai has come to regard Cloud as an important role, commenting that Cloud reminds him of his own past, and that, as a ''Final Fantasy VII'' fan himself, he is happy to contribute.&lt;ref name="InteSakurai"&gt;{{cite book |title=Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (Revised Edition) |year=2009 |isbn=978-4-7575-2560-3 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square Enix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the player's departure from Midgar, Cloud narrates his history with Sephiroth, a legendary member of SOLDIER and the game's primary antagonist, and the events that led to Sephiroth's disappearance five years prior.

However, numerous clues suggest the [[Unreliable narrator|unreliability of Cloud's memory]]. Various visual and audio cues. Cloud will spontaneously remember words or scenes from his past, sometimes collapsing to the ground while cradling his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title = Final Fantasy VII|developer = Square|publisher = Sony Computer Entertainment America|date = September 7, 1997|platform = PlayStation|quote =It was a great place for you two to see each other again. / '''Cloud''': ...You're right. / Why couldn't you see each other alone? / '''Cloud''': ...I don't know.

It is revealed that Cloud never qualified for SOLDIER, and instead enlisted as an infantryman in Shinra's army. During the mission to Nibelheim, Cloud served under Sephiroth and Zack, hiding his identity from the townspeople out of embarrassment. Following Sephiroth's defeat of Zack at the Mt. Nibel Mako reactor, Cloud managed to nearly killed him in an ambush. Both he and Zack are then imprisoned by Shinra's lead scientist, Hojo, for experimentation.

Cloud appears in a minor role in the [[Mobile game|cellphone game]] ''[[Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII]]'', a prequel set six years before ''Final Fantasy VII''. The player, a member of the Shinra covert operatives group, the [[Turks (FF7)|Turks]], encounters Cloud during his time as a Shinra infantryman working to join SOLDIER.

===Reception===
{{quote box|quote=Whether or not you handicap for the massive marketing push that introduced him to the world back in 1997, [Cloud] is probably the most famous hero in the history of the ''Final Fantasy'' series. The spiky blond hair and the gigantic Buster Sword have become instantly identifiable icons, recognized by gamers around the world. If his star has faded somewhat over the last decade and change, maybe it's just a consequence of overexposure – four different sequels and prequels will do that to a guy. Nevertheless, even after the hype blows over, he'll probably still be an icon ten years from now.|source=—[[IGN]] in 2008&lt;ref name=Top-25&gt;{{cite web|url = http://uk.ign.com/articles/2008/05/16/top-25-final-fantasy-characters-day-v?page=3|first=Dave |last=Smith| title = IGN's Top 25 Final Fantasy Characters| work=IGN|publisher=Ziff Davis| accessdate = July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=35%}}
Cloud has been mostly well received by critics.

'''David Nahmad''' (born 1947) is a [[billionaire]] retired [[fine art]] dealer.&lt;ref name="forbes2007"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/1224/080.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414153154/http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/1224/080.html |date=April 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A descendant of a [[Jewish]] [[Syrian people|Syrian]] art family residing in [[Monaco]] and a cousin of the late [[Edmond Safra]], he and his relations are perhaps the single biggest buying force in fine art.&lt;ref name="forbes2007"/&gt; 

==Origin==
The roots of the Nahmad family are in [[Aleppo, Syria]], where [[Sephardic Jewish]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Peter Aspden (December 21, 2012), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/49e1b958-4a0d-11e2-a7b1-00144feab49a.html#axzz2KiAmJnhj Art dealer who bought and sold with immaculate timing] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; banker Hillel Nahmad lived until just after the Second World War. Following anti-Jewish violence in 1947, Hillel Nahmad moved to Beirut, Lebanon and when the situation there became difficult, Hillel took his three sons, [[Giuseppe Nahmad|Joseph (Giuseppe)]], [[Ezra Nahmad|Ezra]] and David, to Milan in the early 1960s.

==Art dealing==
As teenagers in the 1960s, they began to deal in art. Ezra and David skipped school to trade on the Italian stock market. At a [[Juan Gris]] exhibition in Rome organised by cubist dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], Ezra and David bought two works – the only pieces sold. Kahnweiler befriended them, selling them works by Picasso, Braque, Gris.&lt;ref&gt;Jackie Wullschlager (November 11, 2011), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e9cbe436-0a15-11e1-85ca-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2KiAmJnhj Lunch with the FT: Helly Nahmad] ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of the [[Red Brigades]] terror group in the 1970s, Milan was perceived as too dangerous, and the family moved again. Joseph and Ezra headed for [[Monaco]], and David to [[New York City]]. 

Helly Nahmad Gallery, on [[Madison Avenue]], is a company run by David’s son Hillel "Helly" Nahmad, who took over his father’s earlier Davlyn Gallery in 2000.

Jeffrey Deitch, a former dealer and current director of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], once described the Nahmads as "like a major brokerage firm in the stock market", adding: "The market needs a force like this to function."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; [[Sarah Thornton]] discusses their significant influence on the auction market ''Seven Days in the Art World''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/489232834|title=Seven days in the art world|last=L.)|first=Thornton, Sarah (Sarah|isbn=9780393337129|location=New York|oclc=489232834}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''

In 2011, Philippe Maestracci filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking title to the 1918 [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] painting ''[[Seated Man with a Cane]]'', valued at more than $25 million.&lt;ref name="Estate"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/arts/design/estate-sues-nahmad-gallery-network-for-modigliani-portrait.html|title=Estate Sues Nahmad Gallery Network for Modigliani Portrait|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maestracci claimed that the painting had been looted from his grandfather, Oscar Stettiner, during World War II.&lt;ref name="Estate" /&gt;  In 2012, after Defendants moved to dismiss, Maestracci’s counsel withdrew that complaint.&lt;ref name="Estate" /&gt;  In 2015, the Limited Ancillary Administrator for the Estate of Oscar Stettiner filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, seeking the same relief sought in federal court.&lt;ref name="Estate" /&gt; The amended complaint in that action is currently the subject of a motion to dismiss with Defendants’ counsel arguing, among other things, that Defendants purchased the painting in good faith at a public Christie’s auction in London, that Oscar Stettiner did not actually own the subject painting, and that the case is being bankrolled by business people who specialize in funding restitution claims in exchange for obtaining a percentage of any recovery or settlement.&lt;ref name="Estate" /&gt;  Plaintiff's counsel contends that this painting had been sold out of the possessions of Jewish art dealer [[Oscar Stettiner]] by an administrator appointed under the Nazi occupation of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Langhans, Frederik Obermaier, Bastian Obermayer, Kia Vahland: ''Panama Painting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16996">On January 7, 1989, [[Hirohito]], the 124th [[Emperor of Japan]] according to the [[List of Emperors of Japan|traditional order of succession]], died in his sleep at 6:33 AM after suffering from [[intestinal cancer]] for some time. His [[state funeral]] was held on 24 February, when the late emperor was buried near his parents at the [[Musashi Imperial Graveyard]] in [[Hachiōji, Tokyo]].

==Illness and death==
On September 22, 1987, the Emperor underwent surgery on his [[pancreas]] after having digestive problems for several months. The doctors discovered that he had [[duodenal cancer]]. The Emperor appeared to be making a full recovery for several months after the surgery. About a year later, however, on September 19, 1988, he collapsed in his palace, and his health worsened over the next several months as he suffered from continuous internal bleeding.

On January 7, 1989, at 7:55 AM, the [[Grand Steward]] of Japan's [[Imperial Household Agency]], [[Shōichi Fujimori]], officially announced the death of Emperor Hirohito at 6:33 AM, and revealed details about his cancer for the first time. Hirohito was survived by his wife, his five surviving children, ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-japan-archive-1989jan07-story.html#page=3 Hirohito's survivors]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Departed Emperor"==
Emperor Hirohito's death ended the [[Shōwa period|Shōwa era]]. He was succeeded by his son, Crown Prince [[Akihito]]. With Emperor Akihito's accession, a new [[Japanese era name|era]] began: the [[Heisei period|Heisei era]], effective at midnight the day after Emperor Hirohito's death. The new Emperor's formal [[Enthronement of the Japanese Emperor|enthronement ceremony]] was eventually held in Tokyo on November 12, 1990.

From January 7, 1989, until January 31, 1989, the late Emperor's formal appellation was {{nihongo3|"Departed Emperor"|大行天皇|Taikō Tennō}}. The late Emperor's definitive [[posthumous name]], {{nihongo3||昭和天皇|Shōwa Tennō}}, was officially determined on January 13 and formally released on January 31 by [[Toshiki Kaifu]], the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]].

==State funeral==
On Friday, February 24, the Emperor Shōwa's state funeral was held, and unlike that of his predecessor, it was formal but not conducted in a strictly [[Shinto]] manner.&lt;ref name="Yates"&gt;Ronald E. Yates, ''World Leaders Bid Hirohito Farewell'', [[Chicago Tribune]], February 24, 1989 [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-02-24/news/8903080209_1_emperor-hirohito-emperor-akihito-imperial-palace (online)], accessed 13 Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It was a funeral carefully designed both as a tribute to the late Emperor and as a showcase for a peaceful, affluent society Japan had developed into during Hirohito's reign.&lt;ref name="Chira"&gt;Susan Chira, '' With Pomp and on a Global Stage, Japanese Bury Emperor Hirohito'', [[New York Times]], February 24, 1989 [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/24/world/with-pomp-and-on-a-global-stage-japanese-bury-emperor-hirohito.html?pagewanted=all (online)], accessed 13 Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Emperor Taisho's funeral 62 years earlier, there was no ceremonious parade of officials dressed in military uniforms and far fewer of the Shinto rituals used at that time to glorify the Emperor as a near-deity. These changes were meant to highlight that the Shōwa Tennō's funeral would be the first of an emperor under the postwar democratic Constitution, and the first imperial funeral held in daylight.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;
 
The delay of 48 days between his death and the funeral was about the same as that for the previous Emperor, and allowed time for numerous ceremonies leading up to the funeral.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt; The late Emperor's body lay in three coffins; some personal items such as books and stationery were also placed into them.

The weather on the day of the funeral was cold, there was a grey sky that drenched Tokyo with a steady rain.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

===Ceremony at the Imperial Palace===
The ceremonies began at 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. when Emperor Akihito conducted a private ''Ceremony of Farewell'' for his father in the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]].&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

===Funeral procession through Tokyo ===
At 9:35&amp;nbsp;a.m., a black motor hearse carrying the body of the Shōwa Tennō left the Imperial Palace for the 2-mile-long drive to the [[Shinjuku Gyoen]] Garden, where the Shinto and state ceremonies were held.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt; High, piercing notes of reeds broke the silence as the hearse bearing the Emperor's coffin drove over a stone bridge and out through the Imperial Palace gates. The air shook with the sound of cannon and a brass band played a dirge composed for the funeral of the Shōwa Tennō's great-grandmother in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

The motor hearse was accompanied by a procession of 60 cars. The route of the cortege through Tokyo was lined by an estimated 800,000 spectators and 32,000 special police, which had been mobilized to guard against potential terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

The path of the funeral procession passed the [[National Diet]], the democratic core of modern Japan; and the [[National Olympic Stadium (Tokyo)|National Stadium]], where the emperor opened the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] and heralded Japan's postwar re-emergence.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

===Ceremonies at Shinjuku Gyoen Garden===
The 40-minute procession, accompanied by a brass band, ended when it pulled into the [[Shinjuku Gyoen]] Garden, until 1949 reserved for the use of the Imperial family and now one of Tokyo's most popular parks.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

At the Shinjuku Gyoen Garden, the funeral ceremonies for the Shōwa Tennō were conducted in a Sojoden, a specially constructed funeral hall. The funeral hall was constructed of Japanese cypress and held together with bamboo nails in keeping with ancient imperial tradition.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

The official guests were seated in two white tents located in front of the funeral hall. Because of the low temperatures, many guests used chemical hand-warmers and wool blankets to keep warm as the 3-hour Shinto and state ceremonies progressed.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

====Palanquin procession====
The Shōwa Tennō's coffin was transferred into a palanquin made of cypress wood painted with black lacquer. Attendants clad in long gray robes, narrow tall black hats and black outsized wooden sandals, bearing white and yellow banners, shields and signs of the sun and moon, led a 225-member procession. Musicians played [[gagaku]], the atonal court music. Next came gray-robed attendants carrying two sacred sakaki trees draped with cloth streamers and ceremonial boxes of food and silk cloths to be offered to the spirit of the late Emperor.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

In a nine-minute procession, 51 members of the [[Imperial Household Agency]], clad in traditional gray [[Shinto]] costumes, carried the 1.5 ton ''Sokaren'' ([[Litter (vehicle)|Imperial Palanquin]]) containing the 3-layered coffin of the Shōwa Tennō into the funeral hall, as they walked up the aisle between the white tents with domestic and foreign dignataries.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

Behind the coffin walked a chamberlain dressed in white, who carried a platter with a pair of white shoes that tradition says the deceased monarch will wear to heaven. Flutes, pipes and an occasional drum beat sounded as the procession entered the ceremonial grounds.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt; The new Emperor, Akihito, and Empress Michiko, carrying their own large umbrellas, followed the palanquin with other family members.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

The procession passed through a small wooden [[torii]] gate, the Shinto symbol marking the entrance to sacred space, and filed into the Sojoden.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

====Shinto ceremony====
The events in the Sojoden were divided into a religious ''Sojoden no Gi'' ceremony, followed by the state ''Taiso no Rei'' ceremony.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

When the procession entered the funeral hall, the Shinto portion of the funeral began and a black curtain partition was drawn closed. It opened to reveal a centuries-old ceremony. To the accompaniment of chanting, officials approached the altar of the Emperor, holding aloft wooden trays of sea bream, wild birds, kelp, seaweed, mountain potatoes, melons and other delicacies. The foods, as well as silk cloths, were offered to the spirit of the late Emperor. 
The chief of ceremony, a childhood classmate and attendant of Hirohito, then delivered an address, followed by Emperor Akihito.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

The funeral continued as the black curtain closed, signalling the end of the Shinto portion of the funeral.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

====State ceremony====
As the curtain parted again, Japan's [[Chief Cabinet Secretary]] opened the state portion of the funeral. At noon, he called for a minute of silence throughout Japan.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt; [[Noboru Takeshita|Prime Minister Takeshita]] delivered a short eulogy, in which he said that the [[Shōwa period|reign of the late emperor]] would be remembered for its eventful and tumultuous times, including the [[Second World War]] and the eventual reconstruction of Japan.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt; One by one, foreign dignitaries approached the altar and paid their respects. Some merely inclined their heads; some bowed slightly.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

===Ceremony at the Imperial Graveyard===
[[Image:Showa Shrine.jpg|thumb|Emperor Shōwa's tomb in the [[Musashi Imperial Graveyard]], [[Hachiōji, Tokyo]]]]
Following the state ceremony, the Shōwa Tennō's coffin was taken to the [[Musashi Imperial Graveyard]] in the suburban city of [[Hachiōji, Tokyo|Hachiōji]] for burial. At [[Emperor Taishō]]'s funeral in 1927, the trip to the Musashi Imperial Graveyard was carried out as a 3-hour procession, but at the Shōwa Tennō's funeral, the trip was made by motor hearse and cut to 40 minutes.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt; Several hours of ceremonies followed there, until the late emperor was laid to rest at nightfall, the traditional time to bury emperors.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

==Visitors and guests==
An estimated 200,000 people lined the site of the procession - far fewer than the 860,000 officials had projected.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt; The Shōwa Tennō's funeral was attended by some 10,000 official guests, including emissaries from 163 nations and 27 international organizations. A large number of world leaders attended the funeral, including [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I of Spain]], [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden]], [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin of Belgium]], [[Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV|King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV]] of [[Tonga]], [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein of Jordan]], [[Hassanal Bolkiah|Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei]], [[Jigme Singye Wangchuck|King Jigme Singye Wangchuck of Bhutan]], [[Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg]], Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], Managing Director of the [[IMF]] [[Michel Camdessus]], Secretary-General of the [[OECD]] [[Jean-Claude Paye (OECD)|Jean-Claude Paye]], U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]], French President [[François Mitterrand]], Filipino President [[Corazon Aquino]], [[Zaire|Zairian]] [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] [[Mobutu Sese Seko]],&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, Martin. ''The Fate of Africa: A History of the Continent Since Independence'' (Revised and Updated), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian President [[Suharto]], the [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Prince Consort of Denmark]], the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], the [[Harald V of Norway|Crown Prince of Norway]], the [[Vajiralongkorn|Crown Prince of Thailand]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paying Respects: A Global Roll-Call|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/24/world/paying-respects-a-global-roll-call.html|accessdate=1 September 2016|work=[[New York Times]]|date=24 February 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In total there were  55 heads of state, 14 members of royal families, 11 prime ministers, 19 deputy heads of state and other officials present, all of which required placing Tokyo under an unprecedented blanket of security. Because of security concerns for the dignitaries and because of threats from Japanese left-wing extremists to disrupt the funeral, authorities decided to scrap many of the traditional events that normally accompany funerals for Japanese monarchs. Officials also overrode protocol to give US president Bush a front-row seat, even though tradition would have put him toward the back because of his short time in office. Bush, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday afternoon, attended the funeral on Friday afternoon and departed for China on Saturday.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

Japanese officials said it was the biggest funeral in modern history, and the unprecedented turnout of world leaders was recognition of Japan's emergence as an economic superpower. The Shōwa Tennō was the longest-reigning emperor in Japanese history and the last of the major leaders from World War II. Many also viewed the burial of the Shōwa Tennō as the nation's final break with a militaristic past that plunged much of Asia into war in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

The late emperor's wife, the Empress Dowager [[Empress Kōjun|Nagako]], did not attend the ceremonies due to a lingering back and leg malady.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

==Pardons==
To mark the funeral, the government pardoned 30,000 people convicted of minor criminal offenses. The pardons also allowed an additional 11 million people to recover such civil rights as the right to vote and run for public office, which they had lost as a punishment for offenses.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;

==Protests==
The late emperor's funeral, like the man it honored, was dogged by bitter memories of the past. Many [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] veterans of World War II regarded Hirohito as a [[war criminal]] and called upon their countries to boycott the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slavin|first1=Stewart|title=Attending Hirohito funeral a touchy issue|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/02/20/Attending-Hirohito-funeral-a-touchy-issueUPI-NewsFeature/4559603954000|website=UPI|publisher=United Press International|accessdate=2 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902133537/http://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/02/20/Attending-Hirohito-funeral-a-touchy-issueUPI-NewsFeature/4559603954000|archivedate=2 September 2016|date=20 February 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, of the 166 nations invited to send representatives, all but three accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schoenberger |first1=Karl |title=World Leaders Pay Respects at Hirohito Rites |url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1989-02-24/news/mn-273_1_emperor-hirohito |accessdate=4 September 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=24 February 1989 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6kGNerdni?url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1989-02-24/news/mn-273_1_emperor-hirohito |archivedate=4 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Japanese, including a small Christian community, constitutional scholars and opposition politicians, denounced the pomp at the funeral as a return to past exaltation of the emperor and contended that the inclusion of Shinto rites violated Japan's post-war separation of church and state. Some groups, opposed to the Japanese monarchy, also staged small protests.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

The Shinto rites, witnessed by official funeral guests and held at the same site as the state-sponsored portion of the funeral, prompted criticism that the Government was violating the constitutional separation of state and religion. This separation is especially important in Japan because Shinto was used as the religious basis for the ultra-nationalism and militaristic expansion of wartime Japan. Some opposition party delegates to the funeral boycotted that part of the ceremony.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt; During the funeral procession in Tokyo, a man stepped into the street as the cortege approached. He was quickly apprehended by police who hustled him away.&lt;ref name="Yates"/&gt;  At 1:55 P.M., half an hour before the hearse carrying the late emperor's casket passed by, policemen patrolling the highway leading to the Musashi Imperial Graveyard heard an explosion and found debris scattered along the highway. They quickly cleared away the rubble, and the hearse passed without incident. In total, the police also arrested four people, two for trying to disrupt the procession.&lt;ref name="Chira"/&gt;

[[File:Dimitrios Kallergis in 1865, by Disdéri.jpg|thumb|right|Kallergis in Paris in 1865, photographed by [[André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri]].]]
'''Dimitrios Kallergis''' ({{lang-el|Δημήτριος Καλλέργης}}; 1803{{snd}}8 April 1867) was a fighter of the [[Greek War of Independence]], major general, politician and one of the most important protagonists of the [[3 September 1843 Revolution]].

==Life==

===Early life===
Kallergis was born in 1803 in [[Crete]].&lt;ref name=a&gt;Dimitris Fotiadis, ''Όθωνας - Η μοναρχία'', Κυψέλη, Athens 1963, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Hailing from the distinguished Cretan [[Kallergis family]], a historic family of Mylopotamos, the roots of which lay in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and which had risen to prominence under the [[Kingdom of Candia|Venetian domination]] of the island. He was left fatherless at an early age and he was sent to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] to the care of the Tsar's Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Count Nesselrode]], who appears in some sources is mentioned as his uncle.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; After completing his general studies he went to Vienna in order to study medicine.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; On the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]] went to the [[Morea]] and joined the insurgents.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Kalergis, Dimitri |volume=15 |page=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek War of Independence===
On 19 January 1822 he disembarked with his relatives, Emmanuel and Nikolaos Kallergis, and the officer Valianos in Hydra bringing with them ammunitions, whose worth was 100.000 rubles and a recommendation letter of bishop Ignatius Oungrovlachias.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysios Kokkinos, ''Η Ελληνική Επανάστασις'', Μέλισσα, Athens 1974, 6th edition, vol. 2, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1825 he took on along with his compatriot Emmanuel Antoniadis the leadership of the campaign in Crete. On 2 August 200 revolutionaries occupied the [[Gramvousa]]’s fortress, in which many pirates assembled during the next months.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos E. Vakalopoulos, ''Ιστορία του Νέου Ελληνισμού'', vol. 7, Thessaloniki 1986, p. 166 - 168, 381 - 382.&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign failed while, according to the American Philhellene Samuel [[Gridley Howe]], Kallergis was unsuitable for the leader’s position.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos E. Vakalopoulos, vol. 7, Thessaloniki 1986, p. 166 - 168.&lt;/ref&gt;           
Subsequently he participated in the [[Georgios Karaiskakis]]’ expedition in Roumeli and he was distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitris Fotiadis, ''Όθωνας - Η μοναρχία'', Κυψέλη, Athens 1963, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1826 he participated in the failed attack of [[Charles Nicolas Fabvier|Colonel Fabvier]] against Thebes (it was sent as reinforcement by Karaiskakis).&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos E. Vakalopoulos, ''Ιστορία του Νέου Ελληνισμού'', vol. 7, Thessaloniki 1986, p. 664&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 1827 he took part in the victorious [[battle of Kastella]] where he had significant contribution and on February 20 he defended strongly the area of the Three Towers, which was eventually conquered by the Ottomans but she had suffered several losses.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos E. Vakalopoulos, ''Ιστορία του Νέου Ελληνισμού'', vol. 7, Thessaloniki 1986, p. 726&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured by the enemy forces during the disastrous for the Greek troops [[battle of Phaleron]], where he was leader of the Cretan fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysios Sourmelis, ''Ιστορία των Αθηνών κατά τον υπέρ ελευθερίας αγώνα'', 2nd edition, Athens, 1853, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, he was released after paying a large sum of money from his family but during his captivity, his one ear was amputated.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos E. Vakalopoulos, Ιστορία του Νέου Ελληνισμού, vol. 7, Thessaloniki 1986, p. 750&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Independence===
During the government of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], Kallergis was one of his supporters.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; He served as his adjutant and he proceeded to the organization of a regular body of the cavalry, where he became deputy commander.&lt;ref&gt;Μεγάλη Στρατιωτική και Ναυτική Εγκυκλοπαιδεία, vol. 4, Athens, 1929, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; After the governor’s assassination he had sided with [[Augustinos Kapodistrias]] and he actively participated in the civil conflicts of the time. During January 1832 he fought as a cavalry officer in the battles in Argos&lt;ref&gt;Eleni Gardika-Katsiadaki, ''Ο ρόλος της Διάσκεψης του Λονδίνου στην πτώση του Αυγουστίνου Καποδίστρια'', περιοδικό Μνήμων, Society for the Study of Modern Hellenism, 1985, vol. 10, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; and in March in the battle of Loutraki where his and [[Nikitaras]]’ forces were defeated by the troops of [[Ioannis Kolettis]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Benekou, ''Κωλέτης - Ο πατέρας των πολιτικών μας ηθών'', Κυψέλη, Athens 1961, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, he followed a military career as an officer in the regular army&lt;ref name=b&gt;G. Benekou, ''Κωλέτης - Ο πατέρας των πολιτικών μας ηθών'', Κυψέλη, Athens 1961, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; while he was actively involved in the political issues of that period, first as a follower of the Russian party and then of the French party.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Μεγάλη Στρατιωτική και Ναυτική Εγκυκλοπαιδεία'', vol. 4, 1929, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834, during the Bavarian regency and the Kolettis’ government he was imprisoned as a supporter of the Russian party, whose significant members had made at that time various uprisings in the Greek territory.&lt;ref&gt;''Ιστορία Ελληνικού Έθνους'', Εκδοτική Αθηνών, Athens, 1975, vol. 13, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dimitrios Kallergis - Greek Officer.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Kallergis in military uniform as a Major General]]
In 1843, as colonel of the [[cavalry]],&lt;ref name=b/&gt; he was a leading figure of the [[3 September 1843 Revolution]] against [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] which forced the king to dismiss his [[Bavaria]]n ministers and grant a constitution. He was appointed military commandant of Athens, promoted to Major General and ''aide de camp'' to the king. In 1845 he was dismissed by the army and withdrew from Greece, occasioned by an incident between him and Queen Amalia. He went to [[London]], where he became friend with [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon]], nephew of [[Napoleon I]] and later Emperor of the French, which he followed later in [[Paris]] and so he became follower of the French policy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1848 he made an abortive descent on the Greek coast, in the hope of launching a revolution in the Greek kingdom. He was captured, but soon released and, after a stay in the island of [[Zante]], went to Paris (1853).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In 1854, during the [[Crimean War]], he served as Minister of Military Affairs in the [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] cabinet—imposed by the British and French, and hence called "Ministry of Occupation" by the Greeks. Until Mavrokordatos’ arrival, Kallergis exercised authority as dictator,&lt;ref&gt;''Ιστορία Ελληνικού Έθνους'', 1975, vol. 13, p. 148, 165&lt;/ref&gt; with the full support of the French occupation troops. This particular government recalled all the Greek officers who participated in the anti-Ottoman revolutionary movements in Thessaly, Epirus and Macedonia to return to Greece while by personal requirement of Kallergis, Otto's adjutants—[[Gennaios Kolokotronis]], [[Spyromilios]], [[Ioannis Mamouris]] and [[Gardikiotis Grivas]]—were dismissed, while the hitherto Minister of Military Affairs, [[Skarlatos Soutsos]], was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;''Ιστορία Ελληνικού Έθνους'', 1975, vol. 13, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was minister, Kallergis formed for the first time in Greece a fire brigade. In September 1855, a serious episode of Kallergis with the royal couple entailed the fall of Mavrokordatos’ government.&lt;ref&gt;''Ιστορία Ελληνικού Έθνους'', 1975, vol. 13, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861 he was appointed [[Envoy (title)|minister plenipotentiary]] in Paris, in which capacity he took an important part in the negotiations which followed the fall of the Bavarian dynasty and led to the accession of [[George I of Greece|Prince George of Denmark]] to the Greek throne.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1866 he participated in the two-day government of [[Dimitrios Voulgaris]] as Minister of Military Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Ιστορία Ελληνικού Έθνους'', 1975, vol.13, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1866 he returned to Greece as chief equerry of King [[George I of Greece|George I]]. He proposed to the king to assign him the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arguing that with the help of the governments of France and Italy he would be able to accomplish the vision of the ''[[Megali Idea]]'', but King George didn’t believe it.&lt;ref&gt;''Ιστορία Ελληνικού Έθνους'', 1975, vol.13, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of the same year he was elected by the Cretans as leader of the [[Cretan Revolt (1866–69)|Cretan Revolt]], but in September he refused the post because of health problems.&lt;ref&gt;Μεγάλη Στρατιωτική και Ναυτική Εγκυκλοπαιδεία, vol. 4, 1929, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1867 he was appointed as Ambassador of Greece to the [[United States]] but during the trip he fell ill in Paris and returned to Athens, where he died  on 8 April 1867 of [[hemiplegia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ιστορία Ελληνικού Έθνους'', 1975, vol. 13, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dinka people''' ({{lang-din|Jiɛ̈ɛ̈ŋ}}) are a [[Nilotes|Nilotic]] ethnic group native to [[South Sudan]], but also having a sizable [[diaspora]] population. They mostly live along the [[Nile]], from Mangalla to Renk, in regions of [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal,]] Upper Nile (former two of three Southern Provinces in Sudan) and Abyei Area of the Ngok Dinka in South Sudan.
 
The Dinka mainly live on traditional agriculture and pastoralism, relying on cattle husbandry as a cultural pride, not for commercial profit or for meat, but cultural demonstrations, rituals, marriages' dowries and milk feedings for all ages. The Dinka cultivate food crops and cash crops. The food crops are grains, mainly sorghum and millet. The cash crops include groundnuts, sesame and gum-arabic. Cattle are confined to riversides, the [[Sudd]] and grass areas during the dry season, but are taken to high grounds in order to avoid floods and water during the rainy season.

They number around 4.5 million people according to the 2008 Sudan census, constituting about 18% of the population&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Historical Society Virtual Museum, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; of the entire country, and the largest ethnic tribe in [[South Sudan]]. Dinka, or as they refer to themselves, ''Muonyjang'' (singular) and ''jieng'' (plural), make up one of the branches of the River Lake [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotes]] (mainly sedentary agripastoral peoples of the [[Nile Valley]] and [[African Great Lakes]] region who speak [[Nilotic languages]], including the [[Nuer language|Nuer]] and [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Luo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seligman |first=C. G. |first2=Brenda Z. |last2=Seligman |title=Pagan Tribes of the Nilotic Sudan |location=London |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |year=1965 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dinka are sometimes noted for their height. With the [[Tutsi]] of [[Rwanda]], they are believed to be the tallest people in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nmafa.si.edu/exhibits/focus/tutsi.html |title=The Tutsi |work=In and Out of Focus: Images from Central Africa 1885-1960 |publisher=National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts and Bainbridge reported the average height of {{convert|182.6|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} in a sample of 52 Dinka Agaar and {{convert|181.3|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} in 227 Dinka Ruweng measured in 1953–1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=D. F. |last2=Bainbridge |first2=D. R. |title=Nilotic physique |journal=[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology|Am J Phys Anthropol]] |year=1963 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=341–370 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330210309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems the stature of today's Dinka males is lower, possibly as a consequence of undernutrition and conflicts. An anthropometric survey of Dinka men, war refugees in [[Ethiopia]], published in 1995 found a mean height of {{convert|176.4|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chali |first=D. |year=1995 |title=Anthropometric measurements of the Nilotic tribes in a refugee camp |journal=Ethiopian Medical Journal |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=211–217 |doi= |pmid=8674486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies of comparative historical height data and nutrition place the Dinka as the tallest people in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eveleth and Tanner (1976) Worldwide Variation in Human Growth, Cambridge University Press; --Floud et al 1990 Height, Health and History: Nutritional Status in the United Kingdom, 1750-1980, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dinka people have no centralised political authority, instead comprising many independent but interlinked clans. Some of those clans traditionally provide ritual chiefs, known as the "masters of the fishing spear" or'' beny bith'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=G. |last=Lienhardt |title=Divinity and Experience: the Religion of the Dinka |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who provide leadership for the entire people and appear to be at least in part hereditary.

Their language, called [[Dinka language|Dinka]] or "Thuɔŋjäŋ" (''Thoŋ ë Muɔnyjäŋ''), is one of the [[Nilotic languages]] of the [[eastern Sudanic]] language family. The name means "people" in the Dinka language. It is written using the Latin alphabet with a few additions.

==History==
===Precolonial history===
According to oral traditions the Dinka originated from the [[Gezira (state)|Gezira]] in what is now [[Sudan]]. In [[middle ages|medieval]] times this region was dominated by the kingdom of [[Alodia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beswick||first=Stephanie|year=2004|title=Sudan's Blood Memory||publisher=University of Rochester|isbn=1580461514|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Christianity|Christian]], multi-ethnic empire dominated by [[Nubians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Werner|first=Werner|year=2013|title=Das Christentum in Nubien. Geschichte und Gestalt einer afrikanischen Kirche ["Christianity in Nubia. History and shape of an African church"]|language=German|publisher=Lit|isbn=978-3-643-12196-7|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living in its southern periphery and interacting with the Nubians, the Dinka absorbed a sizable amount of the [[Nubian language|Nubian]] [[vocabulary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beswick||first=Stephanie|year=2004|title=Sudan's Blood Memory||publisher=University of Rochester|isbn=1580461514|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 13th century, with the disintegration of Alodia, the Dinka began to migrate out of the Gezira, fleeing slave raids and other military conflicts as well as droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beswick||first=Stephanie|year=2004|title=Sudan's Blood Memory||publisher=University of Rochester|isbn=1580461514|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial period===
{{Empty section|date=November 2018}}

===As part of Sudan===
The Dinka's religions, beliefs and lifestyle have led to conflict with the Arab Muslim government in [[Khartoum]]. The [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]], led by late [[Dr. John Garang De Mabior]], a Dinka, took arms against the government in 1983. During the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|subsequent 21-year civil war]], many thousands of Dinka, along with fellow non-Dinka southerners, were massacred by government forces. The Dinka, led by [[Salva Kiir Mayardit]], have also engaged in a separate civil war with the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] and other groups who accuse them of monopolising power.&lt;ref name=“veconomist” &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=As South Sudan implodes, America reconsiders its support for the regime|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21730154-american-officials-are-fed-up-being-lied-violent-crooked|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bor massacre====
{{Main|Bor massacre}}
On November 15, 1991 the event known as the "Dinkas Massacre" commenced in South Sudan. Forces led by the breakaway faction of [[Riek Machar]] deliberately killed an estimated 2,000 civilians in Dinkas of Hol, Nyarweng, Twic, Bor and others in villages and wounded several thousand more over the course of two months. It is estimated a 100,000 people left the area following the attack.&lt;ref name="The SPLA civil war "&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lvVao2vWnxUC&amp;pg=PA229#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Sudan: Bradt Travel Guide |last=Clammer |first=Paul|year=2005 |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] |accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jieng People also killed in 1991 tribal massacre were people of Khorfulus and Ngok Lual Yak where about 500 people were killed, over 7000 herds of cattle taken, and thousand of houses burnt. The area however remained under the control of SPLA under the command of late General George Athor Deng who later defeated Riek Machar's forces in Panyagor when he reinforced Wuor Mabior of Duk.

==Pastoral strategies==

[[File:Toichuts.png|thumb|An example of rainy season temporary settlements—note the stilts upon which the huts are built to protect against periodic flooding of the region.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cattle byre of the Dinka people.png|thumb|An example of a cattle byre]] --&gt;

* Southern Sudan has been described as "a large basin gently sloping northward",&lt;ref&gt;(Roth 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; through which flow the [[Bahr al Jabal (river)|Bahr el Jebel]] River, the ([[White Nile]]), the [[Bahr el Ghazal River|Bahr el Ghazal]] (Nam) River and its tributaries, and the Sobat, all merging into a vast [[Sudd|barrier swamp]].
* Vast Sudanese oil areas to the south and east are part of the flood plain, a basin in the southern Sudan into which the rivers of [[Congo Basin|Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Ethiopia]] drain off from an [[ironstone plateau]] that belts the regions of [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr El Ghazal]] and [[Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile]].
* The terrain can be divided into four land classes:
** [[highland (geography)|Highlands]]: higher than the surrounding plains by only a few centimeters; are the sites for “permanent settlements”. Vegetation consists of open thorn woodland and/or open mixed woodland with grasses.
** [[Intermediate Lands]]: lie slightly below the highlands, commonly subject to flooding from heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian and East/Central African highlands; Vegetation is mostly open perennial grassland with some [[acacia]] woodland and other sparsely distributed trees.
** [[Toic]]: land seasonally inundated or saturated by the main rivers and inland water-courses, retaining enough moisture throughout the dry season to support cattle grazing.
** [[Sudd]]: permanent swampland below the level of the [[toic]]; covers a substantial part of the floodplain in which the Dinka reside; provides good fishing but is not available for livestock; historically it has been a physical barrier to outsiders’ penetration.
* Ecology of large basin is unique; until recently, wild animals and birds flourished, hunted rarely by the agro-pastoralists.&lt;ref&gt;Roth 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dinka's migrations are determined by the local climate, their agro-pastoral lifestyle responding to the periodic flooding and dryness of the area in which they live. They begin moving around May–June at the onset of the rainy season to their “permanent settlements” of mud and thatch housing above flood level, where they plant their crops of millet and other grain products. These rainy season settlements usually contain other permanent structures such as cattle [[byre]]s ([[luak]]) and granaries. During dry season (beginning about December–January), everyone except the aged, ill, and nursing mothers migrates to semi-permanent dwellings in the toic for cattle grazing. The cultivation of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], and other crops begins in the highlands in the early rainy season and the harvest of crops begins when the rains are heavy in June–August. Cattle are driven to the toic in September and November when the rainfall drops off and allowed to graze on harvested stalks of the crops.&lt;ref&gt;Deng, Francis Mading. ''The Dinka of the Sudan''. Prospect Heights: Waveland Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivisions==
The Dinka (Jieeng) people has fifty six subdivisions: Rek of Wau (Dinka Marial Baai), Palieupiny Malual, Pajook Malual (Malual Gieernyaang/ Malual Buoth Anyaar), Paliet Malual, Abiem Malual, Twic Mayaardit, Kuac Ayok, Awan Chan, Awan Mou, Wan Parek, Aguok Kuei, Apuk Giir, Apuk Padooc, Apuk Jurwiir, Konggoor, Abiem Mayaar, Lou Ariik, Lou Paheer, Luac (Luanyjang), Luac (Luanykoth), Akook, Thiik, Jalwau, Nyang Akoc, Abuook, Atok, Noi, Leer, Muok, Yaar Ayiei Cikom, Thony, Gok, Kuei (Agaar), Rup (Agaar), Pakam (Agaar), Parial (Agaar), Yak (Agaar), Atuot, Ciec, Aliap, Bor, Twi (Twic of Jonglei), Nyarweng, Hol, Luac Akok(Luac of Khorfulus), Rut, Thoi, Ruweng Paweny, Ngok Lual Yak (Ngok of Malakal), Dongjol, Nyiel, Ageer, Abialaang, Ruweng Paanaruu, Ruweng Aloor and Ngok Jok (Ngok of Abyei). Noted that the Rek, Padaang, Malual and Agaar are groups which are composed of independent sub-divisions, each with known borders and a customary authority which managed the affairs of the section alongside governmental structures. In other word, there is no such thing as "Rek paramount Chief, but Rek paramount chiefs."

The number of Dinka sub-divisions is hotly contested as the border or line between group, sub-division and sections is blurred and often difficult to determine. For example, one can divide the Atuot into Apak and Reel, Boor into Athooc and Gok, and Panaruu into Awet and Kuel and Ciec into Ador and Lou where Ador is sub-divided into Gok and Ajiek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twiceast.org |title=TECOSS |work=Twic East Community of South Sudan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619034948/http://www.twiceast.org/ |archivedate=2011-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twicom.org |title=Sudanese Twic Association of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org |title=The UN Refugee Agency |work=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malual is the largest of those groups, numbering over a million people.

===Rek people===
The '''Rek''' is an ethnic group in [[South Sudan]], a subgroup of the Dinka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beswick|first1=Stephanie|title=Sudan's blood memory: the legacy of war, ethnicity, and slavery in early South Sudan|date=2006|publisher=Univ. of Rochester Press|location=Rochester, NY [u.a.]|isbn=9781580461511|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members speak [[Dinka language|South-Western Dinka]], also called Rek, a [[Nilotic]] language. Many members of this ethnicity are Christians. Some estimates put the Rek population at or exceeding 500,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Middleton|first1=John|last2=Tait|first2=David|title=Tribes Without Rulers Studies in African Segmentary Systems.|date=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781136532139|pages=97-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural and religious beliefs==
[[File:Richard Buchta - Dinka girl.jpg|thumb|Late nineteenth century photo of a Dinka girl.]]
The Dinkas' pastoral lifestyle is also reflected in their religious beliefs and practices. Since the arrival of Abrahamic religions most revere one God, [[Nhialic]], who speaks through spirits that take temporary possession of individuals in order to speak through them. The sacrificing of oxen by the "masters of the fishing spear" is a central component of Dinka religious practice. Age is an important factor in Dinka culture, with young men being inducted into adulthood through an initiation ordeal which includes marking the forehead with a sharp object. Also during this ceremony they acquire a second cow-colour name.  The Dinka believe they derive religious power from nature and the world around them, rather than from a religious tome.&lt;ref&gt;Beswick, S.F. (1994) JAAS XXIX, 3-4 (c) E. J. Brill, Leiden Religious Beliefs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dinka diaspora==
Sizable groups of Dinka refugees may be found in distant lands, including the [[United States]] ([[Jacksonville, Florida]] and [[Clarkston, Georgia|Clarkston]], a working-class suburb of [[Atlanta, Georgia]] and in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] such as Omaha NE, Des Moines IA, Sioux Falls SD, and Kansas City MO), as well as [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] in [[Canada]], and [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] in [[Australia]].

The experience of Dinka refugees was portrayed in the documentary movies ''[[Lost Boys of Sudan]]'' by Megan Mylan and Jon Shenk and ''God Grew Tired Of Us'', Joan Hechts' book ''[[The Journey of the Lost Boys]]'' and the fictionalized autobiography of a Dinka refugee, [[Dave Eggers]]' ''[[What Is the What: The Autobiography of Valentino Achak Deng]]''. Other books on and by the Lost Boys include ''The Lost Boys of Sudan'' by Mark Bixler, ''[[God Grew Tired of Us]]'' by [[John Bul Dau]], ''They Poured Fire On Us From The Sky'' by Alephonsion Deng, Benson Deng, and Benjamin Ajak and, "A Long Walk to Water" by Linda Sue Park. In 2004 the first volume of the graphic novel 'Echoes of the Lost Boys of Sudan'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3022317 |title='Echoes of the Lost Boys of Sudan': Comic Book Tells Harrowing Tale of Refugee Children |publisher=NPR |work=NPR News |first=Catherine |last=Cuellar |date=June 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]], [[United States]], chronicling in art and dialogue four lost boys' escapes from the destruction of their hometowns in South Sudan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1714">In [[espionage]], a '''field agent''' is an agent who works in the field as opposed to one who works at the office or [[headquarters]]. A field agent can work alone or in a group but usually has a case officer who is in charge.

Field agents can be [[undercover]], and travel using fake [[passport]]s that may be under the name of a [[front organization]] or [[shell corporation]].

'''Frank Joseph Malina''' (October 2, 1912 – November 9, 1981) was an American [[aeronautical engineer]] and [[Painting|painter]], especially known for becoming both a pioneer in the art world and the realm of scientific engineering.

==Early life==
Malina was born in [[Brenham, Texas]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leonardo.info/about-frank-malina|title=About Frank Malina|date=2016-10-04|work=Leonardo/ISAST|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father came from [[Bohemia]]. Frank's formal education began with a degree in [[mechanical engineering]] from [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in 1934.

In 1935, while a graduate student at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), Malina persuaded Professor of Aeronautics [[Theodore von Kármán]] to allow him to pursue studies into [[rocket]]ry and rocket propulsion. The formal goal was development of a [[sounding rocket]].

Malina and five associates (including [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leonardo.info/blog/2018/06/12/leonardos-strange-angel|title=Leonardo's Strange Angel: Behind the Scenes with Jack Parsons and Frank Malina|date=2018-06-11|work=Leonardo/ISAST|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) became known at Caltech as the "Suicide Squad" because of their dangerous experiments (and failures) when testing rocket motor designs.

Malina's group was forced to move their operations away from the main Caltech campus into the more remote  [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]]. This site and the research Malina was conducting would later become the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL). Malina served as the second Director of JPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/learnmore/directors.php|title=Early History|publisher=[[JPL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the [[Société astronomique de France]] (French Astronomical Society) awarded Malina the [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie#Prix REP-Hirsch|Prix d'Astronautique]] for his contribution to the study of interplanetary travel and astronautics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career==
In 1942, von Kármán, Malina and three other students started the [[Aerojet]] Corporation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By late 1945, Malina's rockets had outgrown the facility at Arroyo Seco, and his tests were moved to [[White Sands Missile Range]] in [[New Mexico]]. Here, the project's [[WAC Corporal]] sounding rocket was the first U.S. rocket to break the 50-mile altitude mark, becoming the first [[sounding rocket]] to reach space.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. at the time used a definition of space as beginning at 50 miles' altitude, instead what would become the international standard {{convert|100|km||abbr=off|sp=us}}. See [[Kármán line]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:P1-RocketBoys.jpg|thumb|Seated left to right: Rudolph Schott, Apollo Milton Olin Smith, Frank Malina (white shirt, dark pants), Ed Forman and Jack Parsons (right, foreground). Nov. 15, 1936.]]
During 1947, with rocket research in high gear, Malina's demanding travel and administrative schedule, along with a dislike of so much rocketry research being devoted to weapons systems and not scientific research, caused him to re-evaluate his career and leave Aerojet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=James L.|title=America's Forgotten Rocketeer|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=August 2014|page=56|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/frank-malina-americas-forgotten-rocketeer|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malina's passing interest in the Communist Party and labor activism while he was a graduate student in the 1930s had also attracted the attention of the FBI.&lt;ref name=jpl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/jplhistory/learnmore/lm-malina.php|title=Frank Malina, JPL Director, 1944 - 1946|publisher=JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to France and joined the fledgling [[United Nations]] as secretariat of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) under [[Julian Huxley]]. In 1951, Malina became head of UNESCO's division of scientific research. Two years later, Malina left UNESCO to pursue an interest in [[kinetic art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCray|first1=W.

He was declared a fugitive, to be arrested if and when he returned to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/the-three-rocketeers|title=Review of "The Three Rocketeers"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 in Paris&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo.info/leoinfo.html Origin of ''Leonardo'' journal] at its official website&lt;/ref&gt; he founded ''[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]]'', an international [[peer-review]]ed [[research journal]] that featured articles written by artists on their own work, and focused on the interactions between the contemporary arts with the sciences and new technologies. The ''Leonardo'' journal is still published {{as of|2018|lc=y}} as a project of [[Leonardo, The International Society of the Arts, Sciences and Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]], the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leonardo.info|title=Home|work=Leonardo/ISAST|access-date=2018-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and family==
Frank Malina died in 1981&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], near [[Paris]], [[France]]. His widow Marjorie Duckworth Malina died in 2006. Their sons [[Roger Malina|Roger]] and Alan Malina live and work in France and Portugal, respectively.

'''George Foster Peabody''' (July 27, 1852 – March 4, 1938) was an American banker and philanthropist.

==Early life==
He was born to George Henry Peabody and Elvira Peabody (''née'' Canfield) as the first of four children.&lt;ref name=Ware&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ware|first1=Louise|title=George Foster Peabody: Banker, Philanthropist, Publicist|date=2009|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0820334561|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents were native New Englanders of colonial ancestry. George Henry Peabody, who came from a line of merchants, bankers and professional men, had moved from Connecticut to [[Columbus, Georgia]], where he ran a prosperous general store. After attending private school in Columbus, young Peabody spent a few months at [[Deer Hill Institute]] in [[Danbury, Connecticut]]. The Civil War, however, impoverished his family, and in 1866 they moved to [[Brooklyn]], New York, and young Peabody went to work as an errand boy.&lt;ref name=Washington&gt;{{cite book|last1=Washington|first1=Booker T.|editor1-last=Kaufman|editor1-first=Stuart|editor2-last=Smock|editor2-first=Raymond W.|editor3-last=Harlan|editor3-first=Louis R.|title=The Booker T. Washington Papers: 1889-95|date=1974|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0252004100|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
In the evenings Peabody read extensively at the library of the Brooklyn [[Y.M.C.A.]], which he later called his "alma mater", and also took part in the activities of the Reformed Church in Brooklyn Heights, where he met and became good friends with young investment banker [[Spencer Trask]]. On May 2, 1881, Peabody became a partner in the new firm of Spencer Trask &amp; Company. During the 1880s and 1890s this investment house took a leading part in financing electric lighting corporations, sugar beet and other industrial enterprises, and railroad construction in the western United States and Mexico. Peabody himself handled most of the firm's railroad investments, working in close association with [[William J. Palmer]]. He also became a director in numerous corporations.  Peabody, his brother Charles Jones Peabody and Spencer Trask amassed a great portion of their wealth from the Edison Electric Company.  Trask served as president of Edison Electric Illuminating, and when [[J. P. Morgan]]—protégé of New England businessman/philanthropist [[George Peabody]]—financier of Edison Electric, merged all into the [[General Electric Company]] in 1892, George Foster Peabody became a member of the GE board of directors.

==Social activism==
Peabody retired from business in 1906 to pursue a life of public service.&lt;ref name=Anderson|Moss|1999&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Eric|last2=Moss|first2=Alfred A.|title=Dangerous Donations: Northern Philanthropy and Southern Black Education, 1902-1930|date=1999|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=978-0826264169|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Long interested in social causes, he supported such progressive ideas as the single tax as advocated by [[Henry George]] in his book ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', free trade, women's suffrage and government ownership of railroads. He was active in the anti-war movement and also interested in education, particularly in the South and particularly for African-Americans.  He served as director of the [[General Education Board]], treasurer of the [[Southern Education Board]] and on the boards of trustees of the [[American Church Institute for Negroes]], [[Hampton Institute|Hampton]] in [[Virginia]], [[Tuskegee University]] in [[Alabama]], the [[University of Georgia]], and the [[Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute]].

==Political activities==
From early in his life Peabody was interested in Democratic Party politics. In the early 1880s, he helped his close friend [[Edward M. Shepard]] organize the Young Men's Democratic Club of Brooklyn, took a part in the 1892 presidential campaign on behalf of [[Grover Cleveland]], supported the [[Gold Democrats]] against [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896, then switched to more moderate monetary reform as a member of the executive committee of the [[Indianapolis Monetary Convention]] in 1897. In 1904 and 1905 he served as treasurer of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. Although he declined to run for political office, and declined President Wilson's offer of a place on the [[Federal Trade Commission]], Peabody was an unofficial counselor to many government officials. From 1914 to 1921 he served on the board of directors of the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] in New York. In June 1932 [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], then [[Governor of New York]], visited Peabody for advice and support in deciding to run for [[President of the United States]].

==Philanthropic activities==
Peabody served from 1884 to 1930 as a trustee of [[Hampton University]], one of Virginia's historically black universities, where he established in the university library the Peabody Collection of rare materials on African-American history, one of the largest collections in the United States.&lt;ref name=Zaki|2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zaki|first1=Hoda M.|title=Civil Rights and Politics at Hampton Institute: The Legacy of Alonzo G. Moron|date=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0252031106|page=16|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 Peabody donated land for Peabody Park at the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncg.edu/bio/facilities/peabody%20park/history.html |title=Peabody Park History |publisher=Uncg.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130143555/http://biology.uncg.edu/facilities/peabody%20park/history.html |archivedate=January 30, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He funded the [[Y.M.C.A. (Columbus, Georgia)|Y.M.C.A. of Metropolitan Columbus]], in Georgia, built in 1903, believed to be the only marble "Y" building in the United States.&lt;ref name="nrhpdoc"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=80001214}}|title=Historic Resources of Columbus, Muscogee County, Georgia: Young Men's Christian Association of Metropolitan Columbus / The Y.M.C.A. of Columbus |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author1=Nancy Alexander |author2=Roger Harris |author3=Janice P. Riggers |date=1980 |accessdate=June 18, 2018}} With {{NRHP url|id=80001214|photos=y|title=accompanying pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warm Springs, Georgia==
After years of visiting the estate of his partner Spencer Trask in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] Peabody agreed to succeed him in 1910 as chairman of the state commission set up to purchase and conserve the famous spa there, and in 1923 he acquired the property at [[Warm Springs, Georgia]] near his boyhood home. In 1924 he invited his friend [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (who had recently contracted a [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|paralytic illness]]) to visit the 90 degree Fahrenheit springs there, which Roosevelt eventually purchased and turned into the [[Little White House]] and the [[Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation]], expanding it from a limited rehab center into a full-service center.

==Honorary degrees==
While his formal education was limited and he had no college degree, Peabody received honorary degrees from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Washington and Lee University|Washington and Lee]] Universities in 1903, and the [[University of Georgia]] in 1906.  This latter institution was the recipient of much of Peabody's philanthropy, including funds to build a fireproof building to house the university's library.  He also donated land to help reorganize the State College of Agriculture, and founded the university's School of Forestry.

==George Foster Peabody Awards==
Perhaps Peabody's best-known legacy is the [[Peabody Awards|George Foster Peabody Awards]], presented annually since 1941 by the [[University of Georgia]]'s [[Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication]] for excellence in radio, and, since 1948, television broadcasting, followed by [[World Wide Web]] content in the late 1990s.

==Personal life==
A tall man, in later years he developed a mane of white hair, and wore a heavy mustache and pointed beard, becoming known for his dignified and courtly manner. He maintained a mansion in Brooklyn, where he entertained lavishly. He also purchased a summer home known as Abenia at [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]], where he spent most of each year. He was frequently a guest at [[Yaddo]], the Saratoga Springs estate of Spencer Trask and his wife, [[Katrina Trask]], and from both estates he developed a wide circle of influence, including many persons from the literary world, church, business, and government, who came to enjoy his gracious hospitality.

A longtime bachelor, in 1920, eleven years after Trask's death in a railroad accident, Peabody married his widow Katrina, and they lived at Yaddo until her death in 1922. Thereafter Yaddo became a great retreat for artists. Peabody continued to live on the estate, and in 1926 he adopted a daughter, Mrs. Marjorie P. Waite, a young woman whom he had come to know in connection with his civic and humanitarian activities and who aided him in them.

Peabody died in 1938 at his home in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]] and is buried at Yaddo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Foster Peabody|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GScid=2339845&amp;GRid=47291523&amp;|website=findagrave.com|accessdate=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Norton Wilcox''' (August 15, 1839 – January 21, 1933) was a businessman and politician in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] and [[Territory of Hawaii]].

==Life==
George Norton Wilcox was born in [[Hilo]] August 15, 1839.
His father was [[Abner Wilcox]] (1808–1869) and mother was Lucy Eliza Hart (1814–1869). His parents were in the company of [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|missionaries to Hawaii]] for the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], sailing in 1836. His parents taught at the [[Haili Church|Hilo Mission]] boarding school founded by [[David Belden Lyman]] and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Portraits of American Protestant missionaries to Hawaii |author= Hawaiian Mission Children's Society |url= https://archive.org/details/portraitsofameri00hawarich |year=1901 |location=Honolulu |publisher=Hawaiian gazette company |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had one older brother and two younger ones born while at Hilo.
In 1846 the family moved to teach at a similar school at the [[Waioli Mission District|Wai{{okina}}oli Mission]] near [[Hanalei, Hawaii]] on the northern coast of the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]]. There he had four more brothers, although one died young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Waioli Mission nomination form |author= Gary T. Cummins |work= National Register of Historic Places |date= March 24, 1973 |publisher= U.S. National Park Service |url= {{NRHP url|id=73000676}} |accessdate= June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from [[Punahou School]] 1850–1860,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[William DeWitt Alexander]] |title=Oahu college: list of trustees, presidents, instructors, matrons, librarians, superintendents of grounds and students, 1841-1906. Historical sketch of Oahu college|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxADAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA89 |year=1907 |publisher=Hawaiian Gazette Company |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked for [[Samuel Garner Wilder]] loading a shipload of [[guano]] from [[Jarvis Island]].  He then attended [[Yale]] from 1860 to 1862 where he studied [[civil engineering]] in the [[Sheffield Scientific School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Yale University |title=Directory of the living non-graduates of Yale university |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bi84AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA136 |year=1910 |publisher=The Tuttle, Morehouse &amp; Taylor company |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned, he and his younger brother Albert worked for [[Robert Crichton Wyllie]] on his [[Princeville, Hawaii|Princeville Plantation]]. Albert would later buy the Princeville Plantation near Hanalei.
George leased and then bought [[Grove Farm (Lihue, Hawaii)|Grove Farm]] from [[Hermann A. Widemann]] (1822–1899) starting in 1864.
Using his engineering training, he designed an irrigation system to bring water from the wet mountains to the [[sugarcane]] fields, an idea later copied by many other planters.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web |title= History |work= Grove Farm web site |url= http://www.grovefarm.com/history |accessdate= June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to grow the farm, and invest in related enterprises, such as other plantations on other islands, a guano fertilizer company of his own, and the [[Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= He used his power wisely |date= December 27, 1999 |author= Brandon Spraguetgi |work= The Garden Island |url= http://thegardenisland.com/news/article_1b4df1aa-ad44-5d99-8b34-86278d21e491.html |accessdate= June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880 he was elected to the house of representatives of the [[legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom]]. When the upper house (known as the House of Nobles) became an elected body in 1887, he served in it from 1888 to 1892. He was appointed as Minister of the Interior from November 8, 1892 to January 12, 1893.  A few days later the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] ended the monarchy.  
The upper house of the legislature then became the senate of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] where he was elected through 1898.&lt;ref name="office"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHe02d/a4206862.dir/Wilcox,%20George%20N.jpg |title=Wilcox, George N. office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=June 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320235054/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHe02d/a4206862.dir/Wilcox%2C%20George%20N.jpg |archivedate=March 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], when the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] proposed building a harbor on the island, Wilcox bought the entire bond issue to finance [[Nawiliwili Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |hdl= 10524/287 |title= U.S. Army on Kaua'i, 1909-1942 |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaii Historical Society |volume= 32 |author= William H. Dorrance |year= 1998 |page= 158  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He died January 21, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= His plantation grew on Kauai |author= Harold Morse |newspaper= [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |date= October 9, 1999  |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/1999/10/09/news/story9.html |accessdate= June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since he never married, his estate was left to his  nephews. It was one of the largest estates in the territory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= George N.

==Family and legacy==
Younger brother [[Albert Spencer Wilcox]] was born May 24, 1844, married Luahiwa, and then Emma Mahelona, became a wealthy plantation owner and politician, and died July 7, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=  The Story of Hawaii and Its Builders |year=1925 |publisher= [[Honolulu Star Bulletin]] |editor= George F. Nellist |url= http://files.usgwarchives.net/hi/statewide/bios/wilcox64bs.txt |chapter= Albert Spencer Wilcox  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another younger brother [[Samuel Whitney Wilcox]] was born September 19, 1847 at Wai{{okina}}oli, married Emma Lyman (daughter of the Hilo missionaries), had six children, and died May 23, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Samuel Wilcox, Hawaii Builder, Is Dead At 82|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/274832938/?terms=Samuel+Wilcox|accessdate=March 2, 2018|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin{{Subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=May 24, 1929|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Samuel's youngest son Gaylord inherited the farm, his two prominent daughters were [[Elsie Hart Wilcox]](1874–1954), who became the first female territorial senator of Hawaii, and [[Mabel Isabel Wilcox]] (1882–1978) who led the restoration of the Wai{{okina}}oli and Grove Farm houses into museums.&lt;ref name="elsie"&gt;{{cite book |title= Women and children first: the life and times of Elsie Wilcox of Kauaʻi |author= Judith Dean Gething Hughes |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year= 1996  |isbn= 978-0-8248-1621-6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oMHfHY6OAnoC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''The Personall Reigne of Christ Upon Earth'' (1642) was popular in the 1650s.&lt;ref name=Howson&gt;{{cite book|last=Howson|first=Barry H.|title=Erroneous and Schismatical Opinions: The Question of Orthodoxy Regarding the Theology of Hanserd Knollys (c.1599-1691)|year=2001|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|pages=285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKBY3VuWAsMC&amp;pg=PA285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry==
Archer lectured in London before being suspended by [[Archbishop Laud]]. In 1631 he was presented to [[All Saints' Church, Hertford]] by the [[Feoffees for Impropriations]] but had fled the country by 1637. He served as pastor of the English church at [[Arnhem]] until his death.&lt;ref name=Brady /&gt; He was probably influenced by [[Thomas Goodwin]].&lt;ref name=Brady /&gt;

==''The Personall Reigne of Christ Upon Earth''==
In ''The Personall Reigne of Christ Upon Earth'', Archer made a number of predictions. He argued that the [[conversion of the Jews]] would take place in either 1650 or 1656.&lt;ref name=Cummins /&gt; He calculated this date by taking the 1290 days of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 12:11 [[Day-year principle|as years]], and counting from [[Julian the Apostate]], the dating of whose reign was uncertain.&lt;ref name=Brady /&gt; Archer also said that the [[papacy]] would disappear in 1666.&lt;ref name=Cummins&gt;{{cite book|last=Cummins|first=Juliet|title=Milton and the Ends of Time|year=2003|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1FITAztgmwC&amp;pg=PA117}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained this date by interpreting the 1260 days in [[Revelation 12]]:6 as years, and counting from 406, which is when he thought "the Bishop of Rome began to usurp Papall power, and about that time some of the 10. Kingdomes in Europe began to arise."&lt;ref name=Brady /&gt; The ten kingdoms that Archer refers are those thought to be represented by the ten toes on the image that Nebuchadnezzar saw in [[Daniel 2]],&lt;ref name=Brady /&gt; following a [[Historicism (Christianity)|historicist interpretation]]. Thirdly, Archer predicted that Christ would [[Second Coming|return]] in around 1700&lt;ref&gt;"It is likely, that Christs comming [sic] from heaven, and raising the dead and beginning his Kingdom, and the thousand yeeres will be about the yeere of our Lord 1700." Henry Archer, ''The Personall Reigne of Christ Upon Earth''. Cited in Hsing-hao Chao, "[http://nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw/bitstream/140.119/33340/10/51501110.pdf Milton and Millenarianism during the English Revolution]" in ''Milton and Seventeenth-Century English Millenarianism''. Dissertation, [[National Chengchi University]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; – this date being calculated by taking the 1335 days of Daniel 12:12 as years, and counting from the end of Julian the Apostate's reign.&lt;ref name=Brady /&gt; Archer argued that this would precede a [[Millennialism|literal thousand year reign]] of the saints on earth, but not with Christ literally present.&lt;ref name=Howson /&gt;

Katherine Hermes suggests that Archer's book set the stage for the coalescence of the [[Fifth Monarchists]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hermes|first=Katherine|title=Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America|year=2006|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|chapter=Fifth Monarchists|page=398|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzvHvEDPosQC&amp;pg=PA398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry John Cambie''' (October 25, 1836 in [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]], [[Ireland]] – April 23, 1928 in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada) was a Canadian [[surveying|surveyor]], [[civil engineer]], and a notable figure in the completion of that country's [[transcontinental railway]].  He was also a notable pioneer resident of Vancouver.

Cambie was educated in [[England]], and emigrated to the [[Province of Canada]] as a youth, where he learned to be a surveyor.  In 1852, he found employment with the [[Grand Trunk Pacific]] Railway, moving to the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) seven years later.  With the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] of Canada in 1867, the CPR was contracted to build a transcontinental railway, which would link the new country and the adjacent colonies and territories of [[British North America]].  With the expansion of the railway into British Columbia, Cambie found himself as the chief surveyor for the CPR in the province.  In this capacity, Cambie argued for a route through the [[Fraser Canyon]], terminating at the small logging community of Granville on [[Burrard Inlet]].  He was convinced of the superiority of this route over the alternatives of [[Howe Sound]] and [[Bute Inlet]] after a trip down the canyon to Granville in 1874.

Cambie's views prevailed, and in 1876, he was made chief surveyor of the CPR's Pacific Division, a position he would hold for the next four years, following which he was promoted to chief engineer.  His work completed, in 1887 Cambie settled in [[Vancouver]], which had been incorporated as the successor to Granville the previous year.  As he recalled in a later interview:
::In May 1887, much to the amusement of my friends, I went out into the country and purchased two lots at the corner of Georgia and Thurlow streets.  I could not, however, induce the city to clear a track so I could reach my property until near the end of that year, when I at once started building and moved out there in 1888. I had to lay the first sidewalk on Georgia at my own expense, as the city would not do it, and when I got the telephone the company dunned me for more than a year to pay for the poles from [[Granville Street]] down to my place, as they told me that no one else in that generation would ever go to live west of Granville Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancourier.com/issues06/035206/entertainment/035206en6.html Early Resident Had to Lay Sidewalk at His Own Expense] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911192351/http://www.vancourier.com/issues06/035206/entertainment/035206en6.html |date=2006-09-11 }}, ''[[Vancouver Courier]]'', March 31, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
[[West End, Vancouver|The area]] of which Cambie spoke is now located near the centre of downtown Vancouver, in one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in the country, and the site of Cambie's home is now the location of Vancouver's tallest building, the [[Living Shangri-La]].

Cambie was a prominent citizen of the nascent city, and was an important advocate for the development of its infrastructure.  He was also instrumental in building [[Christ Church Cathedral (Vancouver)|Christ Church Cathedral]], the major [[Anglican]] church in downtown Vancouver, where he was a key figure for over forty years (a memorial plaque commemorating him can be found inside the church).  In this and other developments, Cambie's connections with the CPR &amp;mdash; and especially, its president, [[William Van Horne]] &amp;mdash; were crucial to his success, since the company owned much of the land around Vancouver.  Cambie remained employed by the CPR, only retiring in 1921.

Cambie died in Vancouver in 1928 at the age of 91.

==Legacy==
The following are named for Cambie:
*Cambie Street - a major thoroughfare in Vancouver, 
** the [[Cambie Street Bridge]]
* '''Cambie Road''', a major east–west thoroughfare in [[Richmond, British Columbia]].
*'''[[H.J. Cambie Secondary School]]''' in Richmond.
*'''Cambie''', a CPR station located just northeast of [[Sicamous, British Columbia]].

'''Jack Soo''' (October 28, 1917 – January 11, 1979) was a [[Japanese American]] [[actor]]. He was best known for his role as Detective Nick Yemana on the television [[sitcom]] ''[[Barney Miller]]''.

== Early life ==
Soo was born '''Goro Suzuki'''  on a ship traveling from [[Japan]] to the [[United States]] in 1917. He lived in [[Oakland, California]], until ordered into [[internment of Japanese Americans|internment]] along with other Japanese Americans during [[World War II]]. He was sent to the [[Topaz War Relocation Center]] in [[Utah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/757/000044625|title=Jack Soo|website=nndb.com|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fellow internees recalled him as a "camp favorite", an entertainer singing at dances and numerous events.&lt;ref name="jsstory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksoo.com/about.htm|title=The Jack Soo Story|last=Adachi|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Adachi|work=You Don’t Know Jack: The Jack Soo Story|year=2009|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soo's career as an entertainer began in earnest at the end of the war, first as a stand-up [[nightclub act|nightclub]] performer primarily in the [[Midwestern United States]]. He changed his name to Soo after working at a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] night club.&lt;ref name="acted"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/147102307|title=Jack Soo, Acted Detective in TV Series|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Fred Ryan]]|location=Washington, D.C.|page=C6|date=January 12,  1979|accessdate=April 5, 2016|registration=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During his years playing the nightclub circuit, he met and became friends with future ''[[Barney Miller]]'' producer [[Danny Arnold]], who was also a performer at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/jack-soo/contributor/964616/bio;_ylt=AiEHNjfRfexF3r1QwLc6kg..o9EF|title=Yahoo TV|website=yahoo.com|accessdate=19 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career==
[[File:Nancy Kwan and Jack Soo in Flower Drum Song 2.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Jack Soo and [[Nancy Kwan]] in ''[[Flower Drum Song (film)|Flower Drum Song]]''.]]
Soo finally earned his big break in 1958 when he was cast in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical hit ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' in the role of the show [[M.C.]] and comedian Frankie Wing ("Gliding through my memoree"). He was working in [[San Francisco]] at the [[Forbidden City (nightclub)|Forbidden City]], a Chinese [[nightclub]] and [[cabaret]], which was portrayed in the musical and movie.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

He was offered the chance to go to Broadway on the condition that he change his name to something Chinese, as ''Flower Drum Song'' is set in San Francisco's [[Chinatown]]. At that time, he adopted the surname that he had used to leave the internment camp at Topaz, "Soo".&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Y. Lee]], author of ''[[The Flower Drum Song]]'', in the special features of the ''Flower Drum Song'' DVD, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Soo switched to the Sammy Fong role&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/141355554|title=Lilting Glow Brightens Tree|last=Coe|first=Richard L.|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Fred Ryan]]|location=Washington, D.C.|date=December 23, 1961|page=B6|registration=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Chinatown's "[[Nathan Detroit]]") during the run and played the role when the [[Flower Drum Song (film)|film version (1961)]] of the musical was made.

Soo was first broadcast across America by [[Jack Benny]] on November 27, 1962, as the street-wise [[talent agent]] in "Jack Meets Japanese Agent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0613653|title='The Jack Benny Program' Jack Meets Japanese Agent (TV Episode 1962)|website=imdb.com|accessdate=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1964, Soo played a weekly supporting role as Rocky Sin, a poker-playing [[con artist]] in ''[[Valentine's Day (TV series)|Valentine's Day]]'', a comedy television series starring [[Anthony Franciosa]] that lasted for one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DS19650107.2.49 |title=Year of Snake? Ah So! Orientals Mark Season's TV |agency=UPI |date=7 January 1965 |newspaper=Desert Sun |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next decade, he would appear in films such ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' as a colonel of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] and the 1967 musical ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'', as well as making guest appearances on TV shows such as ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'', and two episodes of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''.

Soo joined [[Motown Records]] in 1965 as one of their first non-[[African American]] artists. During his time there, he recorded a slow ballad version of "[[For Once in My Life]]" as the first male singer to do so. The record was never released and was shelved in the Motown [[archive]]s. The song was soon after made famous by [[Stevie Wonder]].&lt;ref name="jsstory"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/w_apa/showarticle.aspx?articleID=1923|title='More Stories from Jeff Adachi' on Asian Pacific Arts|last=Lom|first=Michael|website=asiapacificarts.usc.edu|date=November 2, 2011|accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soo was cast in his most memorable role in 1975 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Barney Miller]]'' as the laid-back, but very wry, Detective Nick Yemana, who was responsible for making the dreadful coffee that, in one of the series' running jokes, his fellow detectives had to drink every day.

Soo refused to play roles that were demeaning to [[Asian Americans]] and often spoke out against negative ethnic portrayals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/programs/you-dont-know-jack-soo|title=PBS: You Don't Know Jack Soo|website=pbs.org|publisher=[[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]]|accessdate=April 5,  2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702074908/http://www.pbs.org/programs/you-dont-know-jack-soo|archivedate=July 2, 2013|via=[[Internet Archive|web.archive.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Soo was married to Jan Zdelar, a model. The couple had three children and two grandchildren.&lt;ref name="acted"/&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Barney Miller cast 1977.jpg|thumb|right|Jack Soo (far right) with the ''[[Barney Miller]]'' cast.]]
Soo was diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer]] during ''Barney Miller''{{'}}s fifth season (1978–79). The cancer spread quickly, and Soo died on January 11, 1979, at age 61, at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center (now the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980DE6D71039E732A25750C1A9679C946890D6CF|title=Jack Soo, 63, Actor in 'Barney Miller'. He Was Sgt. Yemana in Television Series Appeared in Movies|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|agency=[[United Press International]]|page=19|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last appearance on the show was in the episode entitled "The Vandal," which aired on November 9, 1978.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

On the show there was a running joke that Soo's character made bad coffee. Therefore, his last known words were when he was being wheeled into an operating room and he joked to Hal Linden, referring to his cancer - 'it must have been the coffee'.

A retrospective episode showing clips of Soo aired at the end of the season, which concluded with the cast members raising their coffee cups in a final farewell [[toast (honor)|toast]] to him.

'''Josiah Mwangi Kariuki''' (21 March 1929 – 2 March 1975) was a Kenyan socialist politician during the administration of the [[Jomo Kenyatta]] government. He held different government positions from 1963, when Kenya became an independent country, to 1975, when he was assassinated. He left behind three wives and many children. He was popularly known as "JM".

==Early life==
J. M. Kariuki was born in [[Kabati-ini]] town in [[Rift Valley province, Kenya|Rift Valley province]], to Kariuki Kigani and Mary Wanjiku. He was the only boy in a family of five siblings. In 1938, he briefly enrolled in Evanson's Day School, but dropped out shortly due to lack of school fees.  He then started working for a settler's farm until 1946, when he won a bet in Nakuru Horse races. Using the bet's proceeds he then enrolled himself back to a string of schools and was able to finish his primary school education in 1950. Later, he joined [[King's College Budo (Uganda)|King's College Budo]] in Uganda's [[Wakiso]] district for his secondary education.

==Political life==
Kariuki's political life probably started in 1946 in earnest, after listening to a Kenyatta speech denouncing the way colonial government was handling the natives in a political rally. It is, however, likely that he was political earlier than that. His parents had earlier on been forced to leave their home area, [[Chinga, Kenya|Chinga]], located in the [[Nyeri County|Nyeri]] native reserve, back in 1928 to work in the white highlands. There, they became squatters on a European settler's farm and were expected, as was the case with other African squatter families, to do the regular and seasonal jobs for wages. Such a trauma was certainly likely to have sharpened  his political impulses.

In the late 1940s, he joined the primary school drama and role played in the fight against colonial rule. While in Uganda for his secondary education, he closely followed the struggles that local Kenyans were facing from the European settlers. On 22 October 1952, he finished his secondary school education and returned to Kenya. Shortly after that, Kenya was placed under state of emergency by the new Governor, Sir Evelyn Baring, and Kariuki joined the [[Mau Mau uprising]]. After Kariuki took his oath, he started working as Mau Mau liaison officer between [[Eldoret]] and [[Kisumu]]. He also helped in soliciting money, boots and housing for Mau Mau. This led to his arrest in his hotel, which was working as a front to his political work. He was then detained in various camps (including Kowop and Langata) from 1953 until his release, seven years later in 1960.

After his release, he managed to secure Kenyatta's approval in starting Nyeri's [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) branch by visiting him in detention. When Kenya became independent, Kariuki worked as Kenyatta's private secretary between 1963 and 1969. In the late 1960s, Kariuki's relationship with Kenyatta became increasingly strained as Kariuki became increasingly vocal of Kenyatta's policy. Some of their disagreements were:
* Government corruption.
* The widening gap between rich and poor due to corruption, drought and the oil shock of 1973.
* Deteriorating relations among East African Community members.
* Unfair distribution of land: After independence, the United Kingdom government gave the Kenyatta government funds to buy back land from the white settlers and redistribute it back to the natives. However, the land was never redistributed; in fact most of it was handed over to Kenyatta's close friends. This was somewhat similar to what happened in USSR in the early 1990s.

In 1974, he was elected as Nyandarua's member of parliament and became an assistant minister in the Kenyatta government between 1974 and 1975. This was despite the government having made every possible effort to thwart his re-election, because his popularity among ordinary Kenyans threatened to overshadow Kenyatta's own. He was last seen alive at the [[Hilton Hotel]], accompanied by Kenyatta's bodyguard on 2 March 1975.

Kariuki's remains were found beside the Lake Magadi Road, south of [[Nairobi]]; his body had been burnt and left on an ant's nest. When the news of Kariuki's death broke, [[Nairobi University]] students marched in protest in the streets of the capital. The march was broken up by Kenyan riot police and the campus was closed down, not reopening during Kenyatta's lifetime.

Altogether Kariuki was a larger- than-life figure on Kenya's political scene, and his violent demise was widely mourned by his compatriots. He had been a prolific giver and "Expressive Giving" best describes his philanthropy: it was prompted by his desire to express support in something larger than himself and reflected his vision for a nation whose citizens would be able to fend for themselves. Accordingly JM's mode of giving was designed to have a measurable impact on society as a whole.

Today, JM is remembered by Kenyans predominantly as a hero. Increasingly he came to represent the force against the evils that have harmed the country to this day. A quote from him is widely remembered:

"In Kenya today, I can only see the dawn of a June morning rising majestically from the white oblivion into the serenity of life." – J. M. Kariuki (1974)

==Book==
Kariuki wrote ''Mau Mau Detainee'', an account of his experience in camps during the uprising that led to Kenya's independence.

==Quotes==
* "Kenya has become a nation of 10 millionaires and 10 million beggars."
* "Every Kenyan man, woman and child is entitled to a decent and just living. That is a birthright. It is not a privilege. He is entitled as far as is humanly possible to equal educational, job and health opportunities irrespective of his parentage, race or creed or his area of origin in this land. If that is so, deliberate efforts should be made to eliminate all obstacles that today stand in the way of this just goal. That is the primary task of the machinery called Government: our Government."
* "We fought for independence with sweat, blood and our lives. Many of us suffered for inordinate days – directly and indirectly. Many of us are orphans, widows and children as a result of the struggle. We must ask: What did we suffer for, and were we justified in that suffering?".

==Death investigation==
A Parliamentary Select Committee was immediately established to investigate the circumstances surrounding Kariuki's murder. The Committee's report assigned senior police officers: Ignatius Iriga Nderi, Ben Gethi, Wanyoike Thungu, Patrick Shaw and other senior administrative officers and politicians, but no one was ever punished. It is most likely that the committee was the means used by Kenyatta's government to mitigate a potential revolt. When the report was finally released, the anger had subsided and likelihood of revolt was much lower.

'''José Casimiro Rondeau Pereyra''' (March 4, 1773 &amp;ndash; November 18, 1844) was a general and politician in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] in the early 19th century.

==Life and Politics==
He was born in [[Buenos Aires]] but soon after his birth, the family moved to [[Montevideo]], where he grew up and went to school. At the age of twenty, he joined the armed forces in Buenos Aires, but later transferred to a regiment in Montevideo. During the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|invasion]] of 1806, he was captured and sent to [[England]]. After the defeat of the British troops, he was released and went to [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]], where he fought in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. When he returned to Montevideo in August 1810, he joined the independentist forces and was nominated military leader of the independentist armies of the ''Banda Oriental'', later Uruguay. His military successes in the various battles for Montevideo (including the [[Siege of Montevideo (1812-1814)]]) won him the post of the military leader of the campaign in [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]], replacing [[José de San Martín]], who had to resign due to health reasons.

In 1815, the Constituting General Assembly of the provinces of La Plata elected Rondeau their [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Supreme Director]], but due to his absence, he never served as director. [[Ignacio Álvarez Thomas]] was named acting Supreme Director in his place. After two defeats against the Spanish royalist troops in Peru at [[Venta y Media]] and [[Battle of Sipe-Sipe|Sipe-Sipe]], he was relieved from his command in 1816. He returned to Buenos Aires, where he became governor for a brief stint from June 5 to July 30, 1818. In 1819 he became [[Juan Martín de Pueyrredón|Pueyrredón]]'s successor as Supreme Director (serving this time), but had to resign the following year after the [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|Battle of Cepeda]].

Subsequently, Rondeau retreated to Montevideo and tried to keep out of the internal wars between competing generals of the independentists. Nevertheless, he led several military campaigns against the Indians and in the independence wars against [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]]. In 1828, after the [[1828 Treaty of Montevideo|Treaty of Montevideo]], he was elected as the governor of the newly founded Eastern Republic of Uruguay. Rondeau occupied this post from December 22, 1828 until April 17, 1830, when he was forced to abdicate by his opponent [[Juan Antonio Lavalleja]], who held the majority in the still young parliament. Lavalleja was named governor ''[[ad interim]]''.

Rondeau still served as general in the army, though. In the [[Uruguayan Civil War|civil war of Uruguay]] from 1836 between the ''Blancos'' ("White") and the ''Colorados'' ("Red"), he fought on the side of the latter and served as their war minister. He was killed in 1844 during the [[Great Siege of Montevideo]].

'''Kate Louise Lawler''' (born 7 May 1980), is an [[English people|English]] [[reality TV]] personality, [[disc jockey|DJ]] and model. She was the first female winner of ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother UK]]'', winning the [[Big Brother 3 (UK)|third series]] (2002) of the reality television show. Since ''Big Brother'', she has worked as a [[television presenter]] and personality, a model and as a [[disc jockey]]. She was born in [[Beckenham]], London.

== ''Big Brother'' ==
Kate Lawler won the [[Big Brother 3 (UK)|third series]] of [[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]] in 2002, becoming the first female contestant to do so.

== Career since ''Big Brother'' ==
In September 2002, Lawler became a DJ on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]], a position she held until December 2003. She co-presented the [[Channel 4]] breakfast TV show ''[[RI:SE]]'' from February 2003 until it was axed in December of that year. In 2005, she was one of the competitors in the [[ITV Network|ITV]] show ''[[Celebrity Wrestling]]'', competing under the name ''The Brawler''. She helped her team, the ''Warriors'', win the team championship, but was eliminated in the semi-finals of the individual competition by fellow model [[Leilani Dowding]].

Lawler wrote a twice-weekly ''[[Big Brother 7 (UK)|Big Brother 7]]'' column for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' online for the duration of the series.

On 14 August 2006, Lawler entered ''[[Love Island (2005 TV series)|Love Island 2]]'' as a new arrival. She came third top female in the final of Love Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://loveisland.itv.com/NewsArticle.aspx?nid=389&amp;tid=1 |title=ITV Entertainment |publisher=Loveisland.itv.com |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019202031/http://loveisland.itv.com/NewsArticle.aspx?tid=1&amp;nid=389 |archivedate=19 October 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Lawler appeared on [[Brainiac: Science Abuse]], receiving an electric shock in an "electric chair". She was a presenter on ''[[Playdate]]'', a late-night [[dating]] programme on [[ITV2]].&lt;ref&gt;http://playdate.itv.com/presenterInfo.php?presenterId=8{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawler has appeared in various men's magazines, including ''[[Loaded (magazine)|Loaded]]'', ''[[Front (magazine)|Front]]'', ''[[Nuts (magazine)|Nuts]]'' and ''[[Zoo (magazine)|Zoo]]''. On 24 July 2006 [[Ann Summers]] announced that Lawler would be the company's new model in its lingerie advertisements.

In 2007 Lawler appeared on the [[BBC]] comedy [[Rob Brydon's Annually Retentive]].

On 1 October 2007 Lawler joined [[Kerrang! Radio]], co-presenting the breakfast show, [[Tim Shaw (DJ)#The Morning After|The Morning After]] alongside [[Tim Shaw (DJ)|Tim Shaw]] from 7:00am–10:00am. When Shaw was suspended from the station on 23 April 2008, Lawler temporarily helmed the breakfast show on her own until Shaw's dismissal was confirmed. At this point, on 12 May 2008, she moved to ''Drive!'', Kerrang's 4:00pm–7:00pm show, which she presented on her own until OJ Borg joined the show as her co-presenter on 27 October 2008. After the departure of Borg in October 2009 she became a solo presenter once again and is building audiences according to recent RAJAR figures with a programme which appears to major on audience interaction and features, much like a breakfast show. Lawler was nominated for a Sony Radio Award for Best Entertainment in 2013.
Kerrang stopped broadcasting on FM in the West Midlands, and was just broadcast digitally in the summer of 2013, and Lawler was made the Breakfast host  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerrangradio.co.uk/on-air/kate-lawler/|title=Kerrang! Radio - Everything That Rocks|website=Kerrang! Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2008 Lawler returned to Big Brother as a hijacker for a day in the new show [[Big Brother Celebrity Hijack]]. She ran the Flora [[London Marathon]] on 13 April 2008 wearing only Ann Summers lingerie, raising funds for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10504029"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10504029 |title=Another success for the 28th London Marathon |author=Taylor, Jerome |date=14 April 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She appeared on the BBC gameshow [[Hole in the Wall (UK game show)|Hole in the Wall]] in autumn 2009 and won the £10,000 which she donated to a [[cystic fibrosis]] charity.

On 18 September 2010 she appeared on Celebrity [[Total Wipeout]], and came third.

In 2013, Kate joined Manchester based [[Key 103]], her show was networked on other [[Northern England|northern]] stations such as [[Radio Aire]], [[Viking FM]] and [[Rock FM]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lep.co.uk/what-s-on/music/big-brother-star-ready-to-rock-1-5962762&lt;/ref&gt; presenting Monday-Thursday from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am. In summer 2014 Liverpool's Radio City 96.7, became part of the shows that were networked. She also started to do the shows from Sunday through to Thursday.

Kate's last show with Key 103 was on Thursday 28 May 2015. Kate still remained part of the Bauer radio family continuing to host her Kerrang Radio Breakfast show each morning until February 2016, in which she joined [[Virgin Radio]],which launched on 30 March, with Kate hosting weekday afternoons from 1{{nbsp}}pm to 4{{nbsp}}pm.

'''Khadzhimurat Magomedovich Akkaev''' ({{lang-ru|Хаджимурат Магомедович Аккаев}}) (born March 27, 1985 in [[Tyrnyauz]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]])&lt;ref name="IWF results" /&gt; is a [[Russia]]n [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifter]] of [[Balkar people|Balkar]] descent.

==Career==
Akkaev competed in the men's 94&amp;nbsp;kg at the [[Weightlifting at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]] where he won a silver medal.&lt;ref name="IWF results"&gt;{{cite web|title=AKKAEV Khadzhimurat |publisher=International Weightlifting Federation |url=http://www.iwf.net/results/results_athlete_e.php?compid=528 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527161201/http://www.iwf.net/results/results_athlete_e.php?compid=528 |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is 178&amp;nbsp;cm/5&amp;nbsp;ft 10 tall and weighs 105&amp;nbsp;kg/231&amp;nbsp;lb.

At the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] he originally was awarded the bronze medal in the 94&amp;nbsp;kg category, with a total of 402&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="IWF results2"&gt;{{cite web|title=AKKAEV Khadzhimurat |publisher=International Weightlifting Federation |url=http://www.iwf.net/results/results_athlete_e.php?compid=2621 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527164520/http://www.iwf.net/results/results_athlete_e.php?compid=2621 |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he was stripped of the medal after his sample tested positive for steroids.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/38017277 "Doping: 2008 Beijing Olympics medal winners among 16 athletes banned for doping"]. bbc.com. 17 November 2016. Retrieved 17 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Akkaev has moved up into −105&amp;nbsp;kg weight category as a replacement for [[Dmitry Lapikov]] and [[Dmitry Klokov]]. He won the [[2011 European Weightlifting Championships]] in [[Kazan]], with a total of 425&amp;nbsp;kg

He became the 2011 World Champion in Paris, beating his compatriot [[Dmitry Klokov]] by 2&amp;nbsp;kg with a total of 430&amp;nbsp;kg.

Akkaev was scheduled to compete at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in the 105&amp;nbsp;kg class but was forced to withdraw due to a back injury. On January 13 2012 Akkaev was found to have failed a doping test prior to [[2012 Olympic Games]]. He was provisionally suspended in January 2017&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwf.net/2017/01/13/public-disclosure-78/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Konkani people''' ({{transl|kok|Koṅkaṇī lok}} also {{transl|kok|Koṅkaṇe}}, {{transl|kok|Koṅkaṇstha}}) are an [[ethno-linguistic]] community who inhabit the [[Konkan Coast]] of south western India and speak the [[Konkani language]]. They originate from coastal [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]], [[Goa]] and in [[Dang District, India|The Dang]] dist and near by [[Dharampur, Gujarat|Dharampur]] place of [[Gujarat]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The word ''[[Konkan]]'' and, in turn ''Konkani'', is derived from ''{{IAST|Kuṅkaṇ''}} or {{IAST|Kuṅkaṇu}}. Different authorities explain etymology of this word differently.
Some include:
*''Koṇ'' meaning top of the mountain.
*Name of aboriginal mother goddess, which is sometimes [[Sanskritisation|sanskritis]]ed to mean goddess [[Renuka]].
Thus the name ''Konkane'', comes from the word ''{{IAST|Konkaṇ}}'', which means ''the people of Konkan''.&lt;ref name=mano&gt;{{cite book|last=Sardessai|first=Manohar Ray|title=A history of Konkani literature: from 1500 to 1992|year=2000|publisher=Sahitya Akedemi|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788172016647|pages=317, (see chapter I, pages: 1–15)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Konkani people speak different dialects of Konkani, their native tongue; although a very high percentage are bilingual.&lt;ref name="languageinindia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageinindia.com/may2001/bilingual.html|publisher=languageinindia.com|title=Language in India|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denominations==

===Endonyms===
[[File:Konkanispeakers.png|thumb|left|Goa: a State in India where Konkani is the official language]]
In general, in Konkani the masculine form used to address a Konkani speaker is ''{{IAST|Koṅkaṇo}}'' and the feminine form is {{IAST|Koṅkaṇe}}. The plural form is ''Konkane'' or ''Konkani''. In Goa ''Konkano'' now refers only to Hindus, and [[Goan Catholics|Catholic Goans]] do not address themselves as Konkanos as they were banned by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] from referring to themselves this way. [[Saraswat Brahmin]]s of Canara refer to the Konkanis as ''{{IAST|Āmcigelo}} /{{IAST|Āmcigelī}}''. This literally means ''our tongue'' or ''people speaking our tongue''. Though this is not common amongst the [[Goans]], they normally refer to Konkani as ''{{IAST|Āmgelī bhās}}'' or ''our language''. Sometimes ''{{IAST|Āmgele}}'' can be used in the Goan context to mean ''people from my community''.  {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Exonyms===
A Konkani person is normally referred to as a ''Konkaniga'' in Kannada (Census of India, 1891). Many of the colonial documents mention them as the ''Concanees'', ''Canarians'', ''Concanies''.&lt;ref name=concanee&gt;{{cite book|last=Great Britain. Parliament.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The then prehistoric region consisting of Modern Goa and some parts of Konkan adjoining Goa were inhabited by the [[Homo sapiens]] in [[Upper paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]] phase i.e. 8000–6000 BC. The rock engraving in many places along the coast has proven the existence of hunter-gathers.&lt;ref name=usgal&gt;{{cite book|last=Kalyan Kumar Chakravarty, Robert G.

Figures of [[Mother goddess]] and many other motifs have been recovered which do not really shed light on the ancient culture and language.&lt;ref name=us2&gt;{{cite book|last=Goa (India : State). Directorate of Archives and Archaeology, Goa University|title=Goa in the Indian sub-continent: seminar papers|year=2001|publisher=Directorate of Archives and Archaeology, Govt. of Goa,|location=Goa|pages=211 pages (see page 24)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of [[Shamanic]] culture have been found in Goa.&lt;ref name=kamat&gt;{{cite web|last=Kamat|first=Nandkumar|title=Prehistoric Goan Shamanism|url=http://www.navhindtimes.in/panorama/prehistoric-goan-shamanism|work=Prehistoric Goan Shamanism|publisher=The navahind times|accessdate=30 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807142019/http://www.navhindtimes.in/panorama/prehistoric-goan-shamanism|archivedate=7 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that tribes of [[Austric]] origin like ''Kols'', ''Mundaris'', ''Kharvis'' may have settled Goa and Konkan during the [[Neolithic]] period, living on hunting, fishing and a primitive form of agriculture since 3500 BC.&lt;ref name=axe&gt;{{cite book|last=De Souza|first=Teotonio R.|title=Goa to me|year=1994|publisher=Concept Publishing Company,|isbn=9788170225041|pages=176 pages (see page 33)}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Goan historian ''Anant Ramakrishna Dhume'', the [[Gauda and Kunbi]] and other such castes are modern descendants of ancient Mundari tribes. In his work he mentions several words of Mundari origin in the Konkani language. He also elaborates on the deities worshiped by the ancient tribes, their customs, methods of farming and its overall impact on modern day Konkani society.&lt;ref name=dhume&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhume|first=Anant Ramkrishna|title=The cultural history of Goa from 10000 B.C.-1352 A.D.|year=1986|publisher=Ramesh Anant S. Dhume|pages=355 pages (see pages 53, 94, 83, 95)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Negroid race|Negroids]] were in a Neolithic stage of primitive culture, and they were food-gatherers rather. Traces of Negroid physical characteristics are found in parts of Goa, at least up to the middle of the first millennium.&lt;ref name=dhume /&gt; The [[Proto-Australoid]] tribe known as the ''Konkas'', from whom is derived the name of the region, ''Kongvan or [[Konkan]]'' with the other mentioned tribes formed reportedly the earliest settlers in the territory.&lt;ref name=gomes&gt;{{cite book|last=Gomes|first=Olivinho|title=Village Goa: a study of Goan social structure and change|year=1987|publisher=S. Chand,|pages=426 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture was not fully developed at this stage, and was just shaping up. The Kols and Mundaris might have been using stone and wood implements as iron implements were used by the [[megalithic]] tribes as late as 1200 BC. The Kol tribe is believed to have migrated from [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="desouza"&gt;{{cite book|last=De Souza|first=Teotonio R.|title=Essays in Goan history|year=1989|publisher=Concept Publishing Company,|isbn=9788170222637|pages=219 pages (see pages 1–16)}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period worship of mother goddess in the form of [[anthill]] or ''Santer'', was started. Anthill is called as ''Roen'' (Konkani:रोयण), this word has been derived from the austric word ''Rono'' meaning with holes. The later Indo-Aryan and Dravidian settlers also adopted anthill worship, which was translated to ''Santara'' in Prakrit by them.&lt;ref name="dhume"/&gt;

===The later period===
[[File:Brahmin Warrior.jpg|thumb|''[[Baji Rao I]]'', the second [[Peshwa]] of the [[Maratha Empire]], was a Konkani and belonged to the [[Chitpavan]] community&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu-Muslim Syncretic Shrines and Communities|author=Burman, J.J.R.|date=2002|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=9788170998396|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mcuxIsn6wbQC&amp;pg=PA33|page=33|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Structure and Change in Indian Society|author1=Singer, M.B.|author2=Cohn, B.S.|date=1970|publisher=Aldine|isbn=9780202369334|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_g-_r-9Oa_sC&amp;pg=PA400|page=400|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Caste Question: Dalits and the Politics of Modern India|author=Rao, A.|date=2009|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520255593|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tDRiJ3HZVPQC&amp;pg=PA55|page=55|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The first wave of [[Vedic people]] came and settled from Northern India in then Konkan region about 2400 BC{{fact|date=August 2018}}. Some of them might have been followers of [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]].&lt;ref name=dhume24&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhume|first=Anant Ramkrishna|title=The cultural history of Goa from 10000 B.C.-1352 A.D.|year=1986|publisher=Ramesh Anant S. Dhume|pages=355 pages (see pages 100–185)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were known to speak{{fact|date=August 2018}} earliest form of [[Prakrit]] or [[Vedic Sanskrit]] vernacular. This migration of the ''northerners'' is mainly attributed to the drying up of the [[Sarasvati River]] in [[Northern India]]. Many historians claim only [[Gaud Saraswat Brahmins]] and few of the other Brahmins to be their descendants. This hypothesis is not authoritative according to some. Balakrishna Dattaram Kamat Satoskar a renowned Goan Indologist and historian, in his work ''Gomantak prakruti ani sanskruti'', Volume I explains that the original [[Rigvedic tribes|Sarasvat tribe]] consisted of people of all the folds who followed the [[varna (Hinduism)|Vedic fourfold system]] and not just Brahmins, as the caste system was not fully developed then, and did not play an important role.(see ''Gomantak prakruti ani sanskruti'', Volume I).

The second wave of Indo-Aryans occurred sometime between 1700 to 1450 BC{{fact|date=August 2018}}. This second wave migration was accompanied by [[Dravidians]] from the Deccan plateau. A wave of ''Kusha'' or [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] people a [[Lothal]] probably around 1600 BC to escape submergence of their civilisation which thrived on sea-trade.&lt;ref name=kamat /&gt; The admixture of several cultures, customs, religions, dialects and beliefs, led to revolutionary change in the formation of early Konkani society.&lt;ref name=dhume24/&gt;

===The classical period===
The [[Maurya empire|Maurya]] era is marked with migrations from the East, advent of [[Buddhism]] and different ''Prakrit'' vernaculars.&lt;ref name=maurya&gt;{{cite web|last=Moraes|first=Prof. George|title=PRE-PORTUGUESE CULTURE OF GOA|url=http://www.goacom.com/community/associations/goaont/convention/moraes.htm|work=Published in the Proceedings of the International Goan Convention|publisher=Published in the Proceedings of the International Goan Convention|accessdate=28 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006190744/http://www.goacom.com/community/associations/goaont/convention/moraes.htm|archivedate=6 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greeks|Greek]]s settled Goa during the [[Satavahana]] rule, similarly a mass migration of Brahmins happened from the north, whom the kings had invited to perform Vedic sacrifices.

The advent of [[Western Satrap]] rulers also led to many [[Indo-scythians|Scythian]] migrations, which later gave its way to the ''Bhoja'' kings.
According to Vithal Raghavendra Mitragotri, many [[Brahmin]]s and [[Vaishya]]s had come with [[Yadava]] Bhojas from the North (see ''A socio-cultural history of Goa from the Bhojas to the Vijayanagara''). The Yadava Bhojas patronised Buddhism and settled many Buddhist converts of Greek and [[Persian people|Persian]] origin.&lt;ref name=bus&gt;{{cite book|last=Satoskar|first=Ba.Da|title=Gomantak prakruti ani sanskuti, khand II, in Marathi|year=1982|publisher=Shubhda publishers|location=Pune|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abhir]]s, [[Chalukya]]s, [[Rashtrakuta]]s, [[Shilahara]]s ruled the then Konkan-Goa for several years which was responsible for many changes in the society. Later The powerful [[Kadambas of Goa]], came to power. During their rule, the society underwent radical transition. Close contact with the [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], introduction of [[Jainism]], patronising [[Shaivism]], use of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Kannada]], the overseas trade had an overwhelming impact on the people.

===13th–19th century AD===

====Turkic rule====
In 1350&amp;nbsp;CE, Goa was conquered by the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origin. However, in 1370, the [[Vijayanagar Empire]], a resurgent Hindu empire situated at modern day [[Hampi]], reconquered the area. The Vijayanagar rulers held on to Goa for nearly 100 years, during which its harbours were important landing places for [[Arabian horse]]s on their way to Hampi to strengthen the Vijaynagar cavalry. In 1469, however, Goa was reconquered, by the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmani Sultans]]. When this dynasty broke up in 1492, Goa became a part of Adil Shah's [[Bijapur Sultanate]], who made [[Goa Velha]] their second capital.
The Bahamanis demolished many temples, and forced the Hindus to convert to Islam. To avoid this religious persecution, several Goans families fled to the neighbourhood kingdom of Soonda.&lt;ref&gt;''Karnataka State Gazetteer'' by Karnataka (India), K. Abhishankar, Sūryanātha Kāmat, Published by Printed by the Director of Print, Stationery and Publications at the Govt. Press, 1990, Page:251&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portuguese rule====
The '''Portuguese Conquest of [[Old Goa|Goa]]''' occurred in 1510 on behalf of the Portuguese admiral [[Afonso de Albuquerque]]. Goa (also ''Old Goa'' or ''Velha Goa'') was not among the cities Albuquerque had received orders to conquer: he had only been ordered by the Portuguese king to capture [[Ormus|Hormuz]], [[Aden]] and [[Malacca]].&lt;ref name="Mendonça"&gt;''Conversions and citizenry: Goa under Portugal, 1510–1610'' Délio de Mendonça p.82''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mh3kKf0VSfQC&amp;pg=PA82]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Goa Inquisition]] was established in 1560, briefly suppressed from 1774 to 1778, and finally abolished in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/sep/14inter1.htm|title='Goa Inquisition was most merciless and cruel'|date=14 September 2005|publisher=Rediff|accessdate=14 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Goan Inquisition is considered a blot on the history of Konkani people and Goa. Its ostensible aim was to preserve the Catholic faith, the Inquisition's beginning in 1561 and its temporary abolition in 1774, some 16,202 persons were brought to trial by the Inquisition. Of this number, it is known that 57 were sentenced to death and executed in person; another 64 were burned in effigy. Others were subjected to lesser punishments or penanced, but the fate of many of the Inquisition's victims is unknown.&lt;ref name="Salomon, H. P 2001 pp. 345-7"&gt;Salomon, H. P. and Sassoon, I. S. D., in Saraiva, Antonio Jose. ''The Marrano Factory. The Portuguese Inquisition and Its New Christians, 1536–1765'' (Brill, 2001), pp. 345–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquisitor's first act was to forbid any open practice of the Hindu faith on pain of death. [[Sephardic Jew]]s living in Goa, many of whom had fled the [[Iberian Peninsula]] to escape the excesses of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] to begin with, were also persecuted.&lt;ref name="Gazetteer"/&gt; Seventy-one ''[[auto de fe|autos da fe]]'' were recorded. In the first few years alone, over 4000 people were arrested.&lt;ref name="Gazetteer"&gt;Hunter, William W, ''The Imperial Gazetteer of India,'' Trubner &amp; Co, 1886&lt;/ref&gt; In the first hundred years, the Inquisition burnt at stake 57 alive and 64 in effigy, 105 of them being men and 16 women. Others sentenced to various punishments totalled 4,046, out of whom 3,034 were men and 1,012 were women.&lt;ref name="Tiswadi"/&gt; According to the ''Chronista de Tissuary'' (Chronicles of [[Tiswadi]]), the last auto da fe was held in Goa on 7 February 1773.&lt;ref name="Tiswadi"&gt;''Sarasvati's Children: A History of the Mangalorean Christians'', Alan Machado Prabhu, I.J.A. Publications, 1999, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Indo-Portuguese historian [[Teotonio R. de Souza]], grave abuse was practised in Goa in the form of 'mass baptism' and what went before it. The practice was begun by the Jesuits and was later initiated by the Franciscans also. The Jesuits staged an annual mass baptism on the Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul (25 January), and to secure as many neophytes as possible, a few days before the ceremony the Jesuits would go through the streets of the Hindu quarter in pairs, accompanied by their slaves, whom they would urge to seize the Hindus. When the slaves caught up to a fugitive, they would smear his lips with a piece of beef, making him an 'untouchable' among his people. Conversion to Christianity was then his only option.

The inquisition was set as a tribunal, headed by a judge, sent to Goa from Portugal and was assisted by two judicial henchmen. The judge was answerable to no one except to Lisbon and handed down punishments as he saw fit. The Inquisition Laws filled 230 pages and the palace where the Inquisition was conducted was known as the Big House and the Inquisition proceedings were always conducted behind closed shutters and closed doors.

According to the historian, "the screams of agony of the victims (men, women, and children) could be heard in the streets, in the stillness of the night, as they were brutally interrogated, flogged, and slowly dismembered in front of their relatives. "Eyelids were sliced off and extremities were amputated carefully, a person could remain conscious even though the only thing that remained was his torso and head.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgweb.org/unethicalconversion/GoaInquisition.htm|publisher=vgweb.org|title=# The Goa Inquisition by Christian Historian Dr. T. R. de Souza |accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr. Diago de Boarda and his advisor Vicar General, Miguel Vaz had made a 41-point plan for torturing Hindus. Under this plan Viceroy [[António de Noronha]] issued in 1566, an order applicable to the entire area under Portuguese rule:&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I hereby order that in any area owned by my master, the king, nobody should construct a Hindu temple and such temples already constructed should not be repaired without my permission. If this order is transgressed, such temples shall be, destroyed and the goods in them shall be used to meet expenses of holy deeds, as punishment of such transgression.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1567, the campaign of destroying temples in Bardez met with success. At the end of it 300 Hindu temples were destroyed. Enacting laws, prohibition was laid from 4 December 1567 on rituals of Hindu marriages, sacred thread wearing and cremation.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

All the persons above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching, failing which they were punished. In 1583 Hindu temples at [[Assolna]] and [[Cuncolim]] were destroyed through army action.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

"The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshipped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers." wrote [[Filippo Sassetti]], who was in India from 1578 to 1588.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

An order was issued in June 1684 eliminating the [[Konkani language]] and making it compulsory to speak the [[Portuguese language]]. The law provided for dealing toughly with anyone using the local language. Following that law all the symbols of non-Christian sects were destroyed and the books written in local languages were burnt.&lt;ref name="vgweb.org"/&gt;

The victims of such inhuman laws of the Inquiry Commission included a French traveller named Charles Delone. He was an eyewitness to the atrocities, cruelty and reign of terror unleashed by priests.&lt;ref name="Dellon"/&gt; He published a book in 1687 describing the lot of helpless victims. While he was in jail, he had heard the cries of tortured people beaten with instruments having sharp teeth. All these details are noted in [[Charles Dellon]]'s book, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k57889g ''Relation de l'Inquisition de Goa''] (The Inquisition of Goa).&lt;ref name="Dellon"&gt;{{cite book|title=L'Inquisition de Goa: la relation de Charles Dellon (1687)|author1=Dellon, G.|author2=Amiel, C.|author3=Lima, A.|date=1997|publisher=Editions Chandeigne|isbn=9782906462281|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=twawcm37sUkC&amp;pg=PP1|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The viceroy ordered that Hindu ''[[pandit]]s'' and physicians be disallowed from entering the capital city on [[horseback]] or [[palanquin]]s, the violation of which entailed a fine. Successive violations resulted in imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Priolkar"/&gt;

Christian palanquin-bearers were forbidden from carrying Hindus as passengers. Christian agricultural labourers were forbidden to work in the lands owned by Hindus and Hindus forbidden to employ Christian labourers.&lt;ref name="Priolkar"&gt;Priolkar, A. K. ''The Goa Inquisition.'' (Bombay, 1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inquisition guaranteed "protection" to Hindus who converted to Christianity. Thus, they initiated a new wave of baptisms to Hindus who were motivated by social coercion into converting.&lt;ref&gt;Shirodhkar, P. P., ''Socio-Cultural life in Goa during the 16th century'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The adverse effects of the inquisition were tempered somewhat by the fact that Hindus were able to escape Portuguese [[hegemony]] by migrating to other parts of the subcontinent&lt;ref&gt;Shirodhkar, P. P., ''Socio-Cultural life in Goa during the 16th century'', p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; including to [[Muslim]] territory.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge history of seventeenth-century music, By Tim Carter, John Butt, pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, the Inquisition also had an adverse unintended consequence, in that it was a compelling factor for the emigration of a large number of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] from the Portuguese colonies, who although Roman Catholic by faith, had now acculturated into Hindu culture. These people went on to seek their fortunes in the courts of different Indian kings, where their services were employed, usually as gunners or cavalrymen.&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple, William, ''[[White Mughals]]'' (2006), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Impact on culture and language=====
In stark contrast to the earlier intense study of the [[Konkani language]] and its cultivation undertaken by the Portuguese priests as a communication medium in their quest for converts during the earlier century, the Inquisition brought about xenophobic measures intended at isolating new converts from the non-Christian populations.&lt;ref name="Machado"/&gt; This suppression of Konkani was in face of the repeated Maratha onslaughts of the late 17th and earlier 18th centuries, which for the first time posed a serious threat to Goa, and by extension, the Portuguese presence in India itself.&lt;ref name="Machado"/&gt; The [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] threat, compounded by their religious zeal, led the Portuguese authorities to initiate a positive programme for the suppression of Konkani in Goa.&lt;ref name="Machado"&gt;''Sarasvati's Children: A History of the Mangalorean Christians'', Alan Machado Prabhu, I.J.A. Publications, 1999, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the ancient language of Konkani was suppressed and rendered unprivileged by the enforcement of Portuguese.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;Newman, Robert S. (1999), ''The Struggle for a Goan Identity'', in Dantas, N., The Transformation of Goa, Mapusa: Other India Press, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
Urged by the [[Franciscan]]s, the Portuguese viceroy forbade the use of Konkani on 27 June 1684 and further decreed that within three years, the local people in general would speak the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese tongue]] and use it in all their contacts and contracts made in Portuguese territories. The penalties for violation would be imprisonment. The decree was confirmed by the king on 17 March 1687.&lt;ref name="Machado"/&gt; However, according to the Inquisitor António Amaral Coutinho's letter to the Portuguese monarch [[John V of Portugal|João V]] in 1731, these draconian measures did not meet with success.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}&lt;ref name="Rivara"&gt;Priolkar, Anant Kakba; Dellon, Gabriel; Buchanan, Claudius; (1961), ''The Goa Inquisition: being a quatercentenary commemoration study of the inquisition in India'', Bombay University Press, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall of the "Province of the North" (which included [[Vasai|Bassein]], [[Chaul]] and [[Salsette]]) in 1739, the assault on Konkani gained new momentum.&lt;ref name="Machado"/&gt; On 21 November 1745, Archbishop Lourenzo de Santa Maria decreed that to qualify for priesthood, the knowledge of, and the ability to speak only in Portuguese, not only for the pretendentes, but also for all the close relations, men as well as women, confirmed by rigorous examinations by reverend persons was an essential prerequisite.&lt;ref name="Machado"/&gt; Furthermore, the ''[[Roman Catholic Brahmin|Bamonns]]'' and ''[[Roman Catholic Kshatriya|Chardos]]'' were required to learn Portuguese within six months, failing which they would be denied the right to marriage.&lt;ref name="Machado"/&gt; The [[Jesuits]], who had historically been the greatest advocates of Konkani, were expelled in 1761. In 1812, the Archbishop decreed that children should be prohibited from speaking Konkani in schools and in 1847, this was extended to seminaries. In 1869, Konkani was completely banned in schools.&lt;ref name="Machado"/&gt;

The result of this linguistic displacement was that Goans did not develop a literature in Konkani, nor could the language unite the population as several scripts (including Roman, Devanagari and Kannada) were used to write it.&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt; Konkani became the ''língua de criados'' (language of the servants)&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;Routledge, Paul (22 July 2000), "Consuming Goa, Tourist Site as Dispencible space", Economic and Political Weekly, 35, Economic and Political Weekly, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; as Hindu and Catholic elites turned to Marathi and Portuguese, respectively. Ironically, Konkani is at present the 'cement' that binds all Konkanis across caste, religion and class and is affectionately termed ''Konkani Mai'' (Mother Konkani).&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt; The language only received official recognition in 1987, when on the February of that year, the Indian government recognised Konkani as the official language of Goa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/City/Goa/Goa-battles-to-preserve-its-identity/articleshow/5935904.cms Goa battles to preserve its identity]&amp;nbsp;– Times of India, 16 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Konkanis today==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Most Konkani people today work as expatriates in western and gulf countries. Also large number of this population works within service sector. Many Konkani  people choose Engineering, Medicine, Law as their career choices. Konkani People have made a great contribution to Kannada literature. Most of the Konkani people stay in Karnataka and are bilingual in Konkani and Kannada.

'''Lorenzo Jerome Gilyard, Jr.''' (born May 24, 1950) is an American [[serial killer]]. A former trash company supervisor,&lt;ref name="usa07"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-05-serial-killings_N.htm |title=6 of 13 counts of murder dropped against serial killings suspect |last= |first= |date=May 3, 2007 |journal=[[USA Today]] |publisher= |place= |page= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilyard is alleged to have [[rape]]d and murdered 13 women and girls from 1977 to 1993. He was convicted of six counts of murder on March 16, 2007.&lt;ref name="ljw07"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2007/mar/17/kansas_city_man_guilty_murdering_six_women/ |title=Kansas City man guilty of murdering six women |last=Hollingsworth |first=Heather |date=March 17, 2007 |journal=LJWorld |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |place= |page= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gilyard's background was dysfunctional; his father, Lorenzo Gilyard (February 24, 1927&amp;nbsp;– October 24, 1999) was convicted of rape in 1970, his brother Darryl E. (also Daryle E.) (born February 12, 1953) was convicted of a [[Drug-related crime|drug-related murder]] in 1989 and sentenced to [[Life imprisonment|life without parole]], and his sister, Patricia D. Dixon (born July 20, 1958), a [[Prostitution|sex worker]], was convicted of the murder of a customer in 1983 and served a 10-year sentence. In his teen years, Gilyard was known to bully and sometimes beat women.&lt;ref name="trucrime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/lorenzo_gilyard/1_index.html|title=Serial killer Lorenzo Gilyard - TruTV Crime Library|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2011-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930115452/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/lorenzo_gilyard/1_index.html|archive-date=2011-09-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
Most, if not all, of Gilyard's victims were sex workers.&lt;ref name="gainsun04"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eLQpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UuwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=lorenzo%20gilyard&amp;pg=6908%2C4296793
 |title=Man Charged in 12 killings of women, girls in Kansas |last= |first= |date=April 20, 2004 |journal=[[The Gainesville Sun]] |publisher= |place=Gainesville, FL |page=7A |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; All were found shoeless and dumped in secluded spots around [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Most had cloth or paper towels stuffed into their mouths and ligature marks around their necks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/lorenzo_gilyard/1_index.html |title=Serial killer Lorenzo Gilyard - TruTV Crime Library |access-date=2009-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930115452/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/lorenzo_gilyard/1_index.html |archive-date=2011-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilyard was a convicted [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]], having raped the 13-year-old daughter of a friend. [[Probation]] records show that from 1969 to 1974 he was suspected of five rapes, but was never convicted.&lt;ref name="usa07"/&gt; Gilyard became a suspect in 1987 in the murder of Sheila Ingold.  A [[crime lab]] later linked all 13 victims to one killer using [[DNA profiling|DNA testing]]. A [[Venipuncture|blood sample]] Gilyard provided in the 1987 investigation led to the murder charges.

Of his known victims, 12 were murdered between 1977 and 1989. After living with Jackie Harris for a short time in [[Missouri]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], they were married in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], on May 29, 1991, after which he and his wife returned to Los Angeles for over a year. Shortly after his return to Missouri, he murdered his 13th known victim. There have been no attempts yet to tie him to any killings in the Los Angeles area during his various stays between 1987 and 1992, and it is assumed, but not proven, that he stopped killing in 1993.

==The trial==
Gilyard was tried on seven [[First-degree murder#Degrees of murder by country|first-degree murder]] charges. The prosecution focused mainly on [[DNA]] evidence&lt;ref name="gainsun04"/&gt; that [[Forensic science|criminal forensics]] experts shows he had sex with the victims around the time they were killed. "All the victims have several things in common: all were found dead during the same one and a half year period, all were left in secluded or obstructed locations, all were strangled, all showed signs that they were involved in a struggle, all were missing their shoes and all but one showed distinct signs of [[sexual intercourse]],"&lt;ref name="usa07"/&gt; Prosecution Attorney Jim Kanatzar said in opening statements to the court.&lt;ref name="sfgate07"&gt;[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/03/05/national/a102354S57.DTL [[San Francisco Chronicle]] ] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilyard was sentenced to [[life in prison]] without [[Parole#United States|parole]].&lt;ref name="syd07"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/life-sentence-for-us-man-who-strangled-six-women/2007/04/14/1175971393675.html |title=Life sentence for US man who strangled six women |last= |first= |date=April 14, 2007 |journal=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher= |place=Sydney, Australia |page= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is serving his life sentence in [[Crossroads Correctional Center]].

*Catherine M. Barry, 34
*Naomi Kelly, 23
*Ann Barnes, 36

*Sheila Ingold, 36

'''Mona Wallén-Hjerpe''' sometimes called '''Sjösalakvinnan''' (''The Sjösala Woman'') was born 24 January 1932 in [[Stockholm]] and died 19 June 2008 (aged 76). Wallén-Hjerpe was a Swedish author and criminal who burnt [[Evert Taube]]'s summer house ''[[Sjösala vals|Sjösala]]'' on 19 December 1969. After that she was placed in a psychiatric hospital. She confessed to the burning of Sjösala on 10 March 1970 and on 1 August she was sentenced for the treatment of mental disorders for having [[schizophrenia]].

Wallén-Hjerpe wrote about her "relationship" to the [[Taube family]] in her 1987 book ''Sjösala brinner'' (Sjösala Is Burning), saying "Evert Taube lovar att gifta sig med mig, men jag blir inspärrad på mentalsjukhus" ("''Evert Taube promises to marry me, but I get locked-in at a [[psychiatric hospital]]''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libris.kb.se/hitlist.jsp?q=f%C3%B6rf%3A%28Wall%C3%A9n-Hjerpe%2C+Mona%2C+1932-%29 |title=sökning: förf:(Wallén-Hjerpe, Mona, 193 |publisher=LIBRIS |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is portrayed as Lena Nylén in [[Fredrik Strage]]'s 2005 book ''Fans'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everttaube.info/bok.php?ISBN=912709877X&amp;id=92&lt;/ref&gt; and later there was a play based on the book, performed at [[Södra Teatern]] in [[Stockholm]].

Mona is also the inspiration for Swedish singer [[Thomaz Ransmyr|Thomaz]]es song "You're In Love With Me" (2012).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The '''Mutoid Waste Company''' was a [[performance art]]s group founded in [[West London (sub region)|West London]], [[United Kingdom]] by [[Joe Rush]] and Robin Cooke in collaboration with Alan P Scott and Joshua Bowler. It started in the early 1980s, emerging from [[Frestonia]]'s 'Car Breaker Gallery'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portobellofilmfestival.com/talkpics/talk-vague06.html PORTOBELLO FILM FESTIVAL 2006 Counter Culture Portobello Psychogeographical History by [[Tom Vague]].]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dangerousminds.net/comments/passport_to_frestonia_photo_documentation_of_the_free_state_of_freston Passport to Frestonia: Photo documentation of the ‘free state’ of Frestonia]&lt;/ref&gt; and continued until the 1990s, when it was based in [[Italy]].

Influenced by the movie ''[[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max]]'' and the popular ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' [[comics]], they specialised in organising illegal parties in [[London]] throughout the 1980s, driven at first by eclectic assortments of fringe music such as [[psychedelic rock]] and [[dub reggae]], but then embracing the burgeoning [[acid house]] music movement by the late 1980s.

==History==
Described as "part street theatre, part art show and part traveling circus" in the 1986 [[London Weekend Television|LWT]] documentary ''South of Watford'' presented by [[Hugh Laurie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7c4d2fc8 | title = The Mutoid Waste Company | date = 1986 | website = bfi.org.uk | publisher = British Film Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av5gQckTN18 Mutoid Documentary I]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9enGdJFRlM Mutoid Documentary II]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group became famous for building giant welded sculptures from waste materials and for customising broken down cars, as well as making large scale [[mural]]s in the disused buildings where they held their parties.

In 1989, after a number of police raids on their warehouse in [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross]], they left the country and travelled to Germany where they became notorious for building giant sculptures out of old machinery and car parts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HW6FAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT49&amp;dq=%22mutoid%20waste%22&amp;pg=PT49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = It's Not About Me! | first = Ian | last = Young | date = 7 Feb 2013 | publisher = Anoma Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which was 'Kaferman', a giant human figure with a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] for its chest, offering a Bird Of Peace sculpture that overlooked the [[Berlin Wall]] towards [[East Berlin]] and the regime of [[East Germany]]. They had a collection of scrap military vehicles, including a Russian [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG 21]] [[fighter aircraft]] which 'followed' them around wherever they went, and a painted tank known as "the Pink Panzer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fotofinder.com/preview/87719D71D35B83E2/ The Pink Panzer], [[Fotofinder]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lady Emma Herbert]], daughter of [[Henry Herbert, 17th Earl of Pembroke]], met the Mutoids at about this time. They taught her acrobatic skills and she toured Europe with them, which was the beginning of her career as a circus trapeze artist.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Grimston and Julia Llewellyn Smith, ''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1042535.ece Focus: Orf to the circus]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'',  December 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s the Mutoids moved to [[Santarcangelo di Romagna]], where they set up a scrap village called Mutonia and continued working, displaying and performing at [[squatting|squats]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] celebrations in the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region.

In recent years, the Mutoids have re-appeared at a number of British festivals and arts events, with displays of their distinctive vehicle sculptures, and they were a key part of [[2012 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony|the closing ceremony]] for the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Owen |last=Gibson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/08/paralympic-closing-ceremony-coldplay |title=Paralympics closing ceremony will be 'festival of flame' and Coldplay |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 8, 2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |quote=The ceremony will also feature a battalion of 'eccentric travellers' storming the stage along with futuristic Mad Max-style vehicles from performance art group the Mutoid Waste Company. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Pakistan}}

A '''Pakistani name''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|'''پاکستانی نام'''}}}}) consists of a [[given name]], sometimes a [[middle name]], and a [[surname]]. Pakistani names vary depending upon [[Demographics of Pakistan|ethnicity]] and spoken [[Languages of Pakistan|language]].

== Given names ==
Since the [[Islam in Pakistan#Arrival of Islam in modern Pakistan|Muslim conquest of the Indus Valley]], the majority of Pakistani given names are derived from [[Persian name|Persian]], [[Arabic name|Arabic]] and [[Turkish name|Turkish]] names. Children may be given one, two or rarely three names at birth. If the person has more than one given name, one of them is chosen as the person’s ''most called name'', by which he is called or referred to informally. Generally for males, [[Muhammad]], the name of the prophet of Islam, is chosen to be the person’s first given name, if he has more than one. Because of the prevalence of this practice, this name is usually not the person’s most called name, as it does not serve as a unique identifier. [[Ali]] is the 2nd most common given name for male in Pakistan. Females are usually given at most two names.

== Surname ==
{{see also|List of Pakistani family names}}
Unlike the practice in Western countries, and other countries with predominant European influence, there is no one way of writing a full name in Pakistan. The most popular convention is to append the most called given name of the father to the person’s given names. Often, if the person has more than one given name, his full name consists only of his given names. Another convention is to prefix the person’s given name with a title, which is usually associated with his tribal ancestry. Due to western influence, appending rather than prefixing titles to given names is becoming more common. One notable exception is the title ''[[Khan (title)|Khan]]'', common in people of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] origin, which has always been appended rather than prefixed to given names. There are several titles used in Pakistan and other Muslim countries. ''[[Syed]]'', ''[[Shaikh]]'', ''[[Khawaja]]'', ''[[Pasha]]'', ''[[Mirza]]'' etc. are common. Less commonly, the tribal name itself is appended to the person’s given names. For females, tribal names or titles rarely figure in the person’s full name (although this is becoming more common due to Western influence). Instead her full name would be composed of her given names only, or if given only one name, her given name appended with her father’s most called name. After marriage, the full name would be her most called name appended with her husband’s most called name. In official documents, a person’s identity is established by listing both the person’s full name (however they may write it), and their father’s. For married women, the husband's name might be used instead of the father's. Official forms always contain fields for both names, and they are used together as '''''A''' son/daughter/wife of '''B''''' on ID cards, passports, diplomas, in court, etc. The problem with these naming conventions is that it is difficult to trace back family roots. Many Muslims have settled in Western world and this naming convention creates some problems as a father will have  a different ''surname'' or ''family name'' from his children.

'''Peter Pond''' (January 18, 1739 or 1740 &amp;ndash; 1807) was a soldier with a [[19th Continental Regiment|Connecticut Regiment]], a [[fur trade]]r, a founding member of the [[North West Company]] and the [[Beaver Club]], an explorer and a [[cartography|cartographer]]. Though he was born and died in [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], [[Connecticut]], most of his life was spent in northwestern North America.

&lt;/ref&gt; He traded throughout [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]]. Through his business he became acquainted with [[Alexander Henry the elder]], [[Simon McTavish]] and the brothers [[Thomas Frobisher|Thomas]], [[Benjamin Frobisher|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Frobisher]].

In 1776–1778 he wintered at a fur post he established at the junction of the [[Sturgeon River (Alberta)|Sturgeon River]] and [[North Saskatchewan River]] near present-day [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]].&lt;ref name="abheritage"&gt;{{cite web

In 1783, Pond's explorations led him to the [[District of Athabasca|Athabasca]], a region stretching from Lac Île-à-la-Crosse to the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]]. There he explored waterways around [[Lake Athabasca]] and determined the approximate locations of [[Great Slave Lake]] and [[Great Bear Lake]] from [[First Nation]]s peoples of the area. From his notes and diaries Peter Pond drew a map showing rivers and lakes of the Athabasca region, including what was known of the whole area from Hudson Bay to the [[Rocky Mountain]]s and interpolating his information to the [[Arctic Ocean]] or [[Northwest Passage]].

In 1785, one copy of Pond's map, accompanied by a detailed report, was submitted to the [[United States Congress]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes|first=Derek|title=Historical Atlas of Canada: Canada's History Illustrated with Original Maps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvtEUChw9uAC&amp;pg=PA141|edition=illustrated|year=2006|publisher=Douglas and McIntyre|location=Vancouver|isbn=978-1-55365-077-5|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second to the [[Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec]], [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]]. Pond needed financial support to carry his explorations to the limits of North America's northwest, but the British government was not forthcoming. A partner in the North West Company, founded in 1784, he was in charge of the company business in the Athabasca and Peace River areas. An ambitious man with a reputation for having a violent temper, he was implicated in two [[murder]]s (one of a rival trader): Although acquitted on the murder charges, the company replaced him with [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]]. In the process of taking over the management of the business Mackenzie learned a great deal from Peter Pond about the Athabasca and Peace River region. Pond left the North West Company in 1788.

Mackenzie was intrigued by Pond's belief that the tributaries of that area, which could be seen gathering into a great river flowing northwestward, flowed to the [[Northwest Passage]]. Mackenzie took the initiative to follow up on Pond's belief and followed this great river to its mouth; the watercourse, now called the [[Mackenzie River]], did in fact flow to the Northwest Passage section of the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Peter Pond had contributed to the mapping of Canada by drawing the general outline of the [[river basin]] that Mackenzie recorded in 1789. The maps that Peter Pond subsequently drew, based on his explorations and on the information provided to him by [[First Nations]] peoples, ultimately gained international recognition for Pond at the end of the 18th century.

In 1790, Pond sold his shares in the North West Company to [[William McGillivray]]. He returned to Milford, Connecticut, where he died in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Name==
The Piscataway were recorded by the English (in days before uniform spelling) as the '''Pascatowies''', '''Paschatoway''', '''Pazaticans''', '''Pascoticons''', '''Paskattaway''', '''Pascatacon''', '''Piscattaway''', and '''Puscattawy'''. They were also referred to by the names of their villages: [[Moyaonce]], Accotick or Accokicke or [[Accokeek tribe|Accokeek]], Potapaco or [[Port Tobacco, Maryland|Portotoack]], Sacayo or Sachia, [[Zekiah Swamp|Zakiah]], Yaocomaco or Youcomako or Yeocomico, or Wicomicons.

Related Algonquian-speaking tribes included the [[Nacotchtank|Anacostan]], Chincopin, Choptico, [[Doeg tribe|Doeg or Doge or Taux]], Tauxeneen, [[Mattawoman]], and [[Pamunkey]]. Possibly slightly more distantly related tribes included the Accomac, [[Assateague people|Assateague]], [[Choptank people|Choptank]], [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]], [[Patuxent people|Patuxent]], [[Pokomoke people|Pokomoke]], [[Tockwogh tribe|Tockwogh]] and [[Wicocomico people|Wicomoco]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian F. Feest, "Nanticoke and Neighboring Tribes", in Sturtevant and Trigger, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The [[Piscataway language]] was part of the large [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language family.&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant and Trigger, 240&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesuit]] missionary Father [[Andrew White (missionary)|Andrew White]] translated the Catholic [[Catechism]] into Piscataway in 1640, and other English missionaries compiled Piscataway-language materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel01-2.html |title= Roman Catholics in Maryland: Piscataway Prayers}}, ''Religion and the Founding of the American Republic,'' 23 July 2010 (retrieved 4 Jan 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Detail of 1608 Smith Map showing the Patawomeck River.jpg|thumb|Detail of 1608 Smith Map showing the Patawomeck River]]

The Piscataway by 1600 were on primarily the north bank of the [[Potomac River]] in what is now [[Charles County, Maryland|Charles]], southern [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]], and probably some of western [[St. Mary's County, Maryland|St. Mary's]] Counties in southern Maryland, according to [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]]'s 1608 map which also notes the several [[Patuxent River]] settlements that were under some degree of Piscataway [[suzerainty]].  The Piscataway settlements appear in that same area on maps through 1700&lt;ref&gt;Feest, in Sturteavant and Trigger, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;and on a map of the Piscataway lands in Kenneth Bryson, ''Images of America: Accokeek'' (Arcadia Publishing, 2013) pp. 10-11, derived from Alice and Henry Ferguson, ''The Piscataway Indians of Southern Maryland ''(Alice Ferguson Foundation, 1960) pp. 8 (map) and p. 11:  "By the beginning of Maryland (English) settlement, pressure from the [[Susquehannocks]] had reduced..the Piscataway 'empire'...to a belt bordering the Potomac south of the falls and extending up the principle tributaries.  Roughly, the 'empire' covered the southern half of present Prince George's County and all, or nearly all, of Charles County."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Traditional culture==
The Piscataway relied more on agriculture than many of their neighbors, which enabled them to live in permanent villages. They lived near waters navigable by canoes. Their crops included corn, several varieties of beans, melons, pumpkins, squash and (ceremonial) tobacco. Men hunted bears, elk, deer, and wolves as well as beaver, squirrels, partridges, wild turkeys, and other small game with bows and arrows. Fishing, oyster and clam harvesting, and gathering berries and nuts in seasons supplemented their diets.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feest in Sturtevant and Trigger, pp. 243-4&lt;/ref&gt;

As was common in other Algonquian villages, Piscataway villages included several individual houses protected by a log [[palisade]].&lt;ref&gt;A [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] drawing of such a traditional village, possibly in tidewater North Carolina, is published in Kenneth Bryson, ''Images of America: Accokeek'' (Arcadia Publishing, 2013), p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson p. 13 cites Duel, Sloan and Pierce, ''The New World'' (1946, Stefan Larant, Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional houses were rectangular and typically 10 feet high and 20 feet long, a type of [[longhouse]], with barrel-shape roofs, covered with bark or woven mats. A hearth occupied the center of the house with a smoke hole overhead.&lt;ref&gt;Feest, in Sturtevant and Trigger, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}

===Precontact===

A succession of [[indigenous peoples]] occupied the Chesapeake and Tidewater region, arriving according to archeologists' estimates from roughly 3,000 to 10,000 years ago. People of Algonquian stock, which ultimately coalesced into the Piscataway nation, lived in the [[Potomac River]] drainage area since at least [[Anno Domini|AD]] 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, p. 11, refers to Robert L. Stephenson, ''The Prehistoric People of Accokeek Creek''&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime around AD 800, peoples living along the Potomac had begun to cultivate [[maize]] as a supplement to their ordinary hunting-gathering diet of fish, game, and wild plants.

Some evidence suggests that the Piscataway migrated from the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], or from the upper Potomac, or from sources hundreds of miles to the north. It is fairly certain, however, that by the 16th century, the Piscataway were a distinct polity with a distinct society and culture, who lived year-round in permanent villages.

The onset of a centuries-long "[[Little Ice Age]]" after 1300 had driven Algonquian and [[Iroquoian]] peoples from upland and northern communities southward to the warmer climate of the Potomac basin. Growing seasons there were long enough for them to cultivate maize. As more tribes occupied the area, they competed for resources and had increasing conflict.

By 1400, the Piscataway and their [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribal neighbors had become increasingly numerous because of their sophisticated agriculture, which provided calorie-rich [[maize]], [[beans]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. These crops added surplus to their hunting-gathering subsistence economy and supported greater populations. The women cultivated and processed numerous varieties of maize and other plants, breeding them for taste and other characteristics.  The Piscataway and other related peoples were able to feed their growing communities.  They also continued to gather wild plants from nearby freshwater marshes.  The men cleared new fields, hunted, and fished.

===17th century and English colonization===

By 1600, incursions by the [[Susquehannock]] and other Iroquoian peoples from the north had almost entirely destroyed many of the Piscataway and other Algonquian settlements above present-day [[Great Falls, Virginia]] on the Potomac River.{{Citation needed|reason=Apr 2010|date=April 2010}} The villages below the fall line survived by banding together for common defense.  They gradually consolidated authority under hereditary chiefs who exacted tribute, sent men to war, and coordinated the resistance against northern incursions and rival claimants to the lands. A hierarchy of places and rulers emerged: [[hamlets]] without hereditary rulers paid tribute to a nearby [[village]].  Its [[tribal chief|chief]], or ''[[werowance]]'', appointed a "lesser king" to each dependent settlement.  Changes in social structure occurred and religious development exalted the hierarchy. By the end of the 16th century, each werowance on the north bank of the Potomac was subject to the [[paramount chief]]: the ruler of the Piscataway known as the ''Tayac''.

The English explorer [[Captain John Smith]] first visited the upper [[Potomac River]] in 1608. He recorded the Piscataway by the name '''Moyaons''', after their "king's house", i.e., capital village or Tayac's residence, also spelled ''Moyaone''.  Closely associated with them were the [[Nacotchtank]] people (''Anacostans'') who lived around present-day [[Washington, DC]], and the ''Taux'' ([[Doeg (tribe)|Doeg]]) on the Virginia side of the river.  Rivals and reluctant subjects of the ''Tayac'' hoped that the English newcomers would alter the balance of power in the region.

In search of trading partners, particularly for furs, the [[Virginia Company]], and later, [[Virginia Colony]], consistently allied with enemies of the settled Piscataway.  Their entry into the dynamics began to shift regional power.  By the early 1630s, the Tayac's hold over some of his subordinate werowances had weakened considerably.

But, when the English began to colonize what is now Maryland in 1634, the Tayac ''[[Kittamaquund]]'' managed to turn the newcomers into allies.  He had come to power that year after killing his brother ''Wannas'', the former Tayac.&lt;ref name="mdroots.thinkport.org"&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://mdroots.thinkport.org/library/kittamaquund.asp |title= Kittamaquund, Tayac of the Piscataway (d. 1641)}}, Exploring Maryland's Roots, Maryland Public Television, 2010, accessed 22 Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He granted the English a former Indian settlement, which they renamed [[St. Mary's City]] after their own monarch.

The Tayac intended the new colonial outpost to serve as a buffer against the Iroquoian [[Susquehannock]] incursions from the north. ''Kittamaquund'' and his wife [[religious conversion|convert]]ed to [[Christianity]] in 1640 by their friendship with the English [[Jesuit]] missionary, Father [[Andrew White (missionary)|Andrew White]], who also performed their marriage.&lt;ref name="mdroots.thinkport.org"/&gt;  Their only daughter [[Mary Kittamaquund]] became a ward of the English governor and his sister-in-law, colonist [[Margaret Brent]], both of whom held power in St. Mary's City and saw to the girl's education, including learning English.

At a young age, Mary Kittamaquund married the much older English colonist [[Giles Brent]], one of Margaret's brothers.  After trying to claim Piscataway territory upon her father's death, the couple moved south across the Potomac to establish a trading post and live at [[Aquia Creek]] in present-day [[Stafford County, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb | url = http://www.appomattoxhistory.com/2010/eleven-new-state-historical-highway-markers-approved.html | title = Eleven New State Historical Markers Approved | access-date = 2010-04-23 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707153454/http://www.appomattoxhistory.com/2010/eleven-new-state-historical-highway-markers-approved.html | archive-date = 2011-07-07 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}, Appomattox History, accessed 22 Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They were said to have had three or four children together. Brent married again in 1654, so his child bride may have died young.

Benefits to the Piscataway in having the English as allies and buffers were short-lived.  The [[Maryland Colony]] was initially too weak to pose a significant threat.  Once the English began to develop a stronger colony, they turned against the Piscataway.  By 1668, the western shore [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] were confined to two reservations: one on the [[Wicomico River (Potomac River tributary)|Wicomico River]]; the other, on a portion of the Piscataway homeland. Refugees from dispossessed Algonquian nations merged with the Piscataway.

Colonial authorities forced the Piscataway to permit the [[Susquehannock]], an Iroquoian-speaking people, to settle in their territory after having been defeated in 1675 by the Iroquois Confederacy ([[Haudenosaunee]]), based in New York.  The traditional enemies eventually came to open conflict in present-day Maryland.  With the tribes at war, the Maryland Colony expelled the Susquehannock after they had been attacked by the Piscataway.  The Susquehannock suffered devastating defeat.

Making their way northward, the surviving Susquehannock joined forces with their former enemy, the Haudenosaunee, the five-nation [[Iroquois Confederacy]]. Together, the Iroquoian tribes returned repeatedly to attack the Piscataway.  The English provided little help to their Piscataway allies.  Rather than raise militia to aid them, the Maryland Colony continued to compete for control of Piscataway land.

Piscataway fortunes declined as the [[England|English]] [[Maryland colony]] grew and prospered.  They were especially adversely affected by epidemics of [[infectious disease]], which decimated their population, as well as intertribal and colonial warfare. After the English tried to remove tribes from their homelands in 1680, the Piscataway fled from encroaching English settlers to [[Zekiah Swamp]] in [[Charles County, Maryland]]. There they were attacked by the [[Iroquois]] but peace was negotiated.&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant and Trigger, 243&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1697, the Piscataway relocated across the Potomac and camped near what is now [[The Plains, Virginia]] in [[Fauquier County, Virginia|Fauquier County]].  Virginia settlers were alarmed and tried to persuade the Piscataway to return to Maryland, though they refused.  Finally in 1699, the Piscataway moved north to what is now called Conoy Island in the Potomac near [[Point of Rocks, Maryland]]. They remained there until after 1722.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison Williams, ''Legends of Loudoun'', pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
In the 18th century, the Maryland Colony nullified all Indian claims to their lands and dissolved the reservations. In the 1770s, some Piscataway, as well as other Algonquian groups migrating away from English settlements, relocated to Pennsylvania just north of the [[Susquehannah River]]. These migrants from the general area of Maryland are referred to as the Conoy and the [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]]. They were spread along the western edge of the [[Pennsylvania Colony]], along with the Algonquian [[Lenape]] who had moved west from modern New Jersey, the [[Tutelo]], the [[Shawnee]] and some [[Iroquois]].&lt;ref&gt;Merritt, Jane T., ''At The Crossroads: Indians and Empires on a Mid-Atlantic Frontier, 1700-1763'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The Piscataway were said to number only about 150 people at that time. They sought the protection of the powerful ''Haudenosaunee'', but the Pennsylvania Colony also proved unsafe.

Most of the surviving tribe migrated north in the late eighteenth century and were last noted in the historical record in 1793 at [[Detroit]], following the American Revolutionary War, when the United States gained independence. In 1793 a conference in [[Detroit]] reported the peoples had settled in Upper Canada, joining other Native Americans who had been allies of the British in the conflict. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Today, descendants of the northern migrants live on the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation]] reserve in Ontario, [[Canada]].

Some Piscataway may have moved south toward the [[Virginia Colony]]. They were believed to merge with the [[Meherrin]].

===19th century===
Numerous contemporary historians and archaeologists, including [[William H. Gilbert]], [[Frank G. Speck]], [[Helen Rountree]], [[Lucille St. Hoyme]], [[Paul Cissna]], [[Thomas Dale Stewart (forensics)|T. Dale Stewart]], [[Christopher Goodwin]], [[Christian Feest]], James Rice, and [[Gabrielle Tayac]], have documented that a small group of Piscataway families continued to live in their homeland.  Although the larger tribe was destroyed as an independent, sovereign polity, descendants of the Piscataway survived.  They formed unions with others in the area, including European indentured servants and free or enslaved Africans.  They settled into rural farm life and were classified as [[free people of color]], but some kept Native American cultural traditions.  For years the United States censuses did not have separate categories for Indians. Especially in the slave states, all [[free people of color]] were classified together as black, in the [[hypodescent]] classification resulting from the racial caste of slavery.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the late 19th century, [[archaeologists]], [[journalists]], and [[anthropologist]]s interviewed numerous residents in Maryland who claimed descent from tribes associated with the former Piscataway [[chiefdom]].  Uniquely among most institutions, the [[Catholic Church]] consistently continued to identify Indian families by that classification in their records. Such church records became valuable resources for scholars and family and tribal researchers.  Anthropologists and [[sociologists]] categorized the self-identified Indians as a [[tri-racial]] community.  They were commonly called a name (regarded as derogatory by some) "[[We-Sorts|Wesorts]]."{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the 19th century, census enumerators classified most of the Piscataway individuals as "free people of color", "[[Free Negro]]"&lt;ref name=st247&gt;Sturtevant and Trigger 247&lt;/ref&gt; or "mulatto" on state and federal census records, largely because of their intermarriage with blacks and Europeans. The dramatic drop in Native American populations due to [[infectious disease]] and warfare, plus a racial segregation based on [[slavery]], led to a binary view of race in the former colony. By contrast, [[Catholic]] parish records in Maryland and some ethnographic reports accepted Piscataway self-identification and continuity of culture as Indians, regardless of mixed ancestry. Such a binary division of society in the South increased after the [[American Civil War]] and the [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of slaves. Southern whites struggled to regain political and social dominance of their societies during and after the [[Reconstruction era]]. They were intent on controlling the [[freedmen]] and asserting [[white supremacy]].

==Revitalization: 20th-21st century==

Although a few families identified as Piscataway by the early 20th century, prevailing racial attitudes during the late 19th century, and imposition of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] policies, over-determined official classification of minority groups of color as black. In the 20th century, Virginia and other southern states passed laws to enforce the "[[one-drop rule]]", classifying anyone with a discernible amount of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] ancestry as "[[negro]]", "[[mulatto]]", or "[[Black people|black]]". For instance, in Virginia, [[Walter Plecker]], Registrar of Statistics, ordered records to be changed so that members of Indian families were recorded as black, resulting in Indian families losing their ethnic identification.&lt;ref&gt;J. Douglas Smith, "The Campaign for Racial Purity and the Erosion of Paternalism in Virginia, 1922–1930: 'Nominally White, Biologically Mixed, and Legally Negro'", ''Journal of Southern History'' 68, no. 1 (2002): 65–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillip Sheridan Proctor, later known as [[Turkey Tayac]], was born in 1895. Proctor revived the use of the title ''tayac'', a hereditary office which he claimed had been handed down to him. Turkey Tayac was instrumental in the revival of [[Indigenous people of the Americas|American Indian]] culture among Piscataway and other Indian descendants throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. He was allied with the [[American Indian Movement]] Project for revitalization.

Chief [[Turkey Tayac]] was a prominent figure in the early and mid-twentieth century cultural revitalization movements.  His leadership inspired tribes other than the Piscataway, and revival has also occurred among other Southeastern [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] communities. These include the [[Lumbee]], [[Nanticoke people|Nanticoke]], and [[Powhatan]] of the Atlantic coastal plain.  Assuming the traditional leadership title "tayac" during an era when American Indian identity was being regulated to some extent by [[blood quantum]], outlined in the [[Indian Reorganization Act]], Chief Turkey Tayac organized a movement for American Indian peoples that gave priority to their self-identification.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are still Indian people in southern Maryland, living without a reservation in the vicinity of US 301 between [[La Plata, Maryland|La Plata]] and [[Brandywine, Maryland|Brandywine]]. They are formally organized into several groups, all bearing the Piscataway name.&lt;ref&gt;Helen C. Rountree, Wayne E. Clark, and Kent Mountford, ''John Smith's Chesapeake Voyages'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Chief Turkey Tayac died in 1978, the Piscataway split into the Piscataway Conoy Confederacy and Subtribes (PCCS), the Cedarville Band of Piscataway Indians, and the Piscataway Indian Nation.  These three organizations have disagreed over a number of issues: seeking state and federal tribal recognition, developing casinos on their land if recognition were gained, and determining which groups were legitimately Piscataway.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4183/is_20050617/ai_n14672067 |title= Jeffrey Ian Ross, "Commentary: Maryland's struggle to recognize its Native American}} ''The (Baltimore) Daily Record'', Jun 17, 2005, accessed 8 Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=divided&gt; {{citeweb| url = http://www.somdnews.com/stories/080307/indytop200606_32124.shtml |title= A tribe divided: Piscataway Indians’ search for identity sparks squabbles}} Mitrano, Erica.''Southern Maryland Newspapers Online.'' 3 Aug 2007 (retrieved 4 Jan 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two organized Piscataway groups have formed:
*[[Piscataway Indian Nation and Tayac Territory]] headed by Billy Redwing Tayac, [[indigenous rights]] activist and son of the late Chief Turkey Tayac;
*Piscataway Conoy Tribe, which is split between two tribal entities:&lt;ref name=witte /&gt;
**Piscataway Conoy Confederacy and Sub-Tribes
**Cedarville Band of Piscataway Indians, led by Natalie Proctor.&lt;ref name=divided/&gt;

In the late 1990s, after conducting an exhaustive review of primary sources, a Maryland-state appointed committee, including a [[genealogist]] from the Maryland State Archives, validated the claims of core Piscataway families to Piscataway heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url =http://www.somdnews.com/stories/082907/indylet183859_32113.shtml |title= R. Christopher Goodwin, "Clarifying the Piscataway petition for recognition"}}, letter to the editor, 29 Aug 2007, ''SoMdNews.com'', accessed 8 Oct 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  A fresh approach to understanding individual and family choices and self-identification among American Indian and African-American cultures is underway at several research universities.  Unlike during the years of racial segregation, when all people of any African descent were classified as black, new studies emphasize the historical context and evolution of seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth century ethnic cultures and racial categories.

The State of Maryland appointed a panel of anthropologists, genealogists, and historians to review primary sources related to Piscataway genealogy. The panel concluded that some contemporary self-identified Piscataway descended from the historic Piscataway.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url =http://www.somdnews.com/stories/082907/indylet183859_32113.shtml |title = Dr. R. Christopher Goodwin, "Letter to the Editor}}, ''Maryland Independent'', 29 Aug 2007, accessed 20 Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the Maryland Commission on Indian Affairs (MCIA) suggested granting state recognition to the Picataway Conoy Confederacy and Subtribes.  Critics were concerned about some of the development interests that backed the Piscataway Conoy campaign, and feared gaming interests. (Since the late twentieth century, many recognized tribes have established casinos and gaming entertainment on their reservations to raise revenues.) Gov. [[Parris Glendening]], who was opposed to gambling, denied the tribe's request.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun.com"/&gt;

In 2004, Governor [[Bob Ehrlich]] also denied the Piscataway Conoy's renewed attempt for state recognition, stating that they failed to prove that they were descendants of the historical Piscataway Indians, as required by state law. Throughout this effort, the Piscataway-Conoy stated they had no intent to build and operate casinos.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;

In December 2011, the Maryland Commission on Indian Affairs stated that the Piscataway had provided adequate documentation of their history and recommended recognition.  On January 9, 2012, Gov. [[Martin O'Malley]] issued executive orders recognizing all three Piscataway groups as Native American tribes.  As part of the agreement that led to recognition, the tribes renounced any plans to launch gambling enterprises, and the executive orders state that the tribes do not grant any special "gambling privileges".&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb| url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-omalley-tribes-20120109,0,2292739.story |title = Dresser, Michael, "O'Malley formally recognizes Piscataway tribe}}, ''The Baltimore Sun,'' 9 Jan 2012, accessed 11 Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proclus''' or '''Proklos''' ({{lang-el|Πρόκλος}}) was a teacher of [[rhetoric]] and a native of [[Naucratis]] in [[Hellenistic Egypt]]. He lived in the 2nd century.

He was a man of distinction in his native city, but because of the civil commotions there he went to [[Athens]] while still young. There he became a pupil of [[Adrianus]], and afterwards taught rhetoric himself. He had [[Philostratus]] as one of his pupils. It was his practice to allow anyone who paid down 100 [[drachma]]s at once admission to all his lectures. He also had a library which he allowed his pupils to use. In the style of his discourses he imitated [[Hippias]] and [[Gorgias]]. He was remarkable for the tenacity of his memory, which he retained even in extreme old age.

He possessed several houses in and near Athens, and imported considerable quantities of merchandise from Egypt, which he resold to local vendors. After the death of his wife and son he took a concubine. He entirely surrendered the control of his household to her, and was considerably discredited as a consequence of her mismanagement of it.

'''Raymond Zacharie Bourque''' (September 11, 1917 – May 31, 1998) was a Canadian politician. He represented the [[Electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]] of [[Yarmouth (provincial electoral district)|Yarmouth]] in the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] from 1953 to 1956.

The '''Salvadorans''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''''Salvadoreños''''') are people who identify with [[El Salvador]]. Salvadorans are mainly [[Mestizos]] (mixed European and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] heritage), [[indigenous people]] or Amerindians and descendants from European people.  Most Salvadorans live in El Salvador, although there is also a significant Salvadoran [[diaspora]], particularly [[Salvadoran Americans|in the United States]], with smaller communities in other countries around the world.

El Salvador's population was 6,218,000 in 2010, compared to 2,200,000 in 1950.&lt;ref name="WPP 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm|title=Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision|website=Esa.un.org|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the percentage of the population below the age of 15 was 32.1%, 61% were between 15 and 65 years of age, while 6.9% were 65 years or older.&lt;ref name="WPP 2012"/&gt;

==History==
===Lithic era===
[[File:Pinturas Rupestres Corinto Morazan 06.JPG|thumb| Humanoid petroglyph in [[Holy Spirit Grotto]] (corinto cave), Morazan, El Salvador.]]
[[File:Pinturas Rupestres Corinto Morazan.JPG|thumb|Petroglyphs in [[Holy Spirit Grotto]] (corinto cave), Morazan, El Salvador.]]
 
El Salvador was inhabited by [[Paleo-Indians]], the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|first peoples]] who subsequently inhabited, the [[Americas]] during the [[Quaternary glaciation|glacial episodes]] of the [[Late Pleistocene|late Pleistocene period]]. Their intriguing paintings (the earliest of which date from 8000 BC) can still be seen and marveled at in caves outside the towns of Corinto and [[Cacaopera]], both in Morazán. Originating in the [[Paleolithic]] period, these cave paintings exhibit the earliest traces of human life in El Salvador; these early Native Americans people used the cave as a refuge, Paleoindian artists created cave and rock paintings that are located in present-day El Salvador.
 
The [[Lencas]] later occupied the cave and utilised it as a spiritual place. Other ancient petroglyphs called piedras pintadas (rock paintings) include la Piedra Pintada in San Jose Villanueva, La Libertad and the piedra pintada in San Isidro, Cabañas. The rock petroglyphs in San Jose Villanueva near a cave in (Walter Thilo Deininger National Park) are similar to other ancient rock petroglyph around the country. Regarding the style of the engravings it has been compared by with the petroglyphs of La Peña Herrada (Cuscatlán), el Letrero del Diablo (La Libertad) and la Peña de los Fierros (San Salvador). We can add to the list the sites in Titihuapa, the Cave of Los Fierros and La Cuevona both in ( Cuscatlán ).

===Archaic Period===
{{Main|History of Mesoamerica (Paleo-Indian)}}
Native Americans appeared in the [[Pleistocene era]] and became the dominant people in the [[Lithic stage]], developing in the [[Archaic period in North America]] to the [[Formative stage]], occupying this position for thousands of years until their demise at the end of the 15th and 16th century, spanning the time of the original arrival in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] to [[European colonization of the Americas]] during the early modern period.
 
About 40,000 years ago the ancestors of the [[indigenous people of the Americas]] split from the rest of the world following the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] and then they flourish mightily, evolving in the Americas, from the [[Lithic stage]] to the [[Post-Classic stage]], which was brought into an abrupt end about 525 years ago with the infamous mass genocide and cultural extinction caused by Europeans intrusion into the Americas, bringing diseases and colonizing the Americas with warfare, terrorism, extremists radical Christianity and mass massacres. Only some Native American indigenous groups survived that catastrophe, most of them in [[Mexico]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]], with Salvadoran indigenous being one of many who have given rise to all modern Native Americans still alive today.

Historically El Salvador has had diverse Native American cultures, coming from the north and south of the continent along with local populations mixed together. El Salvador belongs to both to the [[Mesoamerican region]] in the western part of the country, and to the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area]] in the eastern part of the country, where a myriad of indigenous societies have lived side by side for centuries with their unique cultures and speaking different [[indigenous languages of the Americas]] in the beginning of the [[Classic stage]].
 
The [[Lenca people]] are an indigenous people of eastern El Salvador where population today is estimated at about 37,000. The Lenca was a matriarchal society and was one of the [[first civilization]]s to develop in El Salvador and were the first major civilization in the country. The pre-Conquest [[Salvadoran Lenca]] had frequent contact with various Maya groups as well as other indigenous peoples of Central America. The origin of Lenca populations has been a source of ongoing debate amongst anthropologists and historians. Throughout the regions of Lenca occupation, Lenca pottery is a very distinguishable form of [[Pre-Columbian art]]. Handcrafted by Lenca women, Lenca pottery is considered an ethnic marking of their culture. Some scholars have suggested that the Lenca migrated to the Central American region from South America around 3,000 years ago, making it the oldest civilization in El Salvador. Guancasco is the annual ceremony by which Lenca communities, usually two, gather to establish reciprocal obligations in order to confirm peace and friendship. [[Quelepa]] is a major site in eastern El Salvador. Its pottery shows strong similarities to ceramics found in central western El Salvador and the Maya highlands. The Lenca sites of Yarumela, Los Naranjos in Honduras, and Quelepa in El Salvador, all contain evidence of the [[Usulután]]-style ceramics.
 
The [[Cacaopera people]] are an indigenous people in El Salvador who are also known as the Matagalpa or Ulua. Cacaopera people spoke the [[Cacaopera language]], a [[Misumalpan language]]. Cacaopera is an extinct language belonging to the Misumalpan family, formerly spoken in the department of Morazán in El Salvador. It was closely related to Matagalpa, and slightly more distantly to Sumo, but was geographically separated from other [[Misumalpan languages]].
 
The [[Xinca people]], also known as the Xinka, are a non-Mayan indigenous people of Mesoamerica, with communities in the western part of El Salvador near its border. The Xinka may have been among the earliest inhabitants of western El Salvador, predating the arrival of the Maya and the Pipil. The Xinca ethnic group became extinct in the Mestizo process.
 
El Salvador has two [[Maya peoples|Maya]] groups, the [[Poqomam people]] and the [[Ch'orti' people]]. The Poqomam are a Maya people in western El Salvador near its border. Their indigenous language is also called Poqomam. The Ch'orti' people (alternatively, Ch'orti' Maya or Chorti) are one of the indigenous Maya peoples, who primarily reside in communities and towns of northern El Salvador. The Maya once dominated the entire western portion of El Salvador, up until the eruption of the [[lake ilopango]] super volcano. Mayan ruins are the most widely conserved in El Salvador and artifacts such as [[Maya ceramics]] [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] [[Mesoamerican calendars]] and [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] can be found in all Maya ruins in El Salvador which include [[Tazumal]], [[San Andrés, El Salvador]], [[Casa Blanca, El Salvador]], [[Cihuatan]], and [[Joya de Ceren]].
 
[[Alaguilac people]] were a former indigenous group located on northern El Salvador. Their language is unclassified. The [[Alagüilac language]] is an undocumented indigenous American language that is now extinct. The Alaguilac ethnic group became extinct during the Mestizo process.
 
The [[Mixe people]] is an indigenous group that inhabited the western borders of El Salvador. They spoke the [[Mixe languages]] which are classified in the Mixe–Zoque family, The [[Mixe languages]] are languages of the Mixean branch of the [[Mixe–Zoquean]] language family. The Mixe ethnic group became extinct during the Mestizo process.

The Mangue people, also known as Chorotega, spoke the [[Mangue language]], a now-extinct [[Oto-Manguean language]]. They were indigenous to eastern El Salvador border, near the gulf.
 
The [[Pipils|Pipil people]] are an indigenous people who live in western El Salvador. Their language is called Nahuat or Pipil, related to the Toltec people of the [[Nahuatl Nation|Nahua peoples]] and were speakers of early Nahuatl languages. However, in general, their mythology is more closely related to the [[Maya mythology]], who are their near neighbors and by oral tradition said to have been adopted by Ch'orti' and Poqomam Mayan people during the Pipil exodus in the 9th century CE. The culture lasted until the Spanish conquest, at which time they still maintained their Nawat language, despite being surrounded by the Maya in western El Salvador. By the time the Spanish arrived, Pipil and Poqomam Maya settlements were interspersed throughout western El Salvador. The Pipil are known as the last indigenous civilization to arrive in El Salvador, being the least oldest and were a determined people who stoutly resisted Spanish efforts to extend their dominion southward. The Pipil are direct descendants of the Toltecs, but not of the Aztecs.
 
Evidence of [[Olmec]] civilization presence in western El Salvador can be found in the ruin sites of [[Chalchuapa]] in the [[Ahuachapan]] department. Olmec petroglyphs can be found on boulders in Chalchuapa portraying Omlec warriors with helmets identical to those found on the [[Olmec colossal heads]]. This suggest that the area was once an Olmec enclave, before fading away for unknown reasons. The Olmecs are believed to have lived in present-day El Salvador as early as 2000 BC. The 'Olmec Boulder, ' is a sculpture of a giant head found near [[Casa Blanca, El Salvador]] site in Las Victorias near Chalchuapa. "Olmecoid" figurins such as the [[Potbelly sculpture]] have been found through this area, in fact most are described as looking primeval proto-Olmec.

===16th century===
At the time of the Spanish conquest, the area was composed of several indigenous states of the [[Post-Classic stage]] who resisted the Europeans as Central America was ravaged by epidemics of diseases, sometimes the Spanish purpously resorted to spreading diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[cholera]]. Smallpox was only the first epidemic. [[Typhus]] in 1546, [[influenza]] and smallpox together in 1558, smallpox again in 1589, [[diphtheria]] in 1614, measles in 1618—all ravaged the remains of any indigenous force.

===Pipil resistance battle===
{{unreferenced|date=July 2018|section}}
[[File:Pedro de Alvarado.JPG|thumb|[[Spaniard]] conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]] and his army became the first to settle and establish European colonies in El Salvador in 1524.]]

[[File:CIUDAD VIEJA.jpg|thumb|[[Ciudad Vieja, El Salvador]],(Old City), also known as Old San Salvador, was a lost colony established in 1525 in what is today's El Salvador. It was a first attempt by the Spaniards to establish a permanent settlement in El Salvador. The city was abandoned after Native repeatedly  attacked and then resettled again in 1528, then completely abandoned and dismantled in 1545. The settlement resembles more of a fortified military base rather than a city. The historic census indicates that the city contained male Spaniards with many Mestizo children with indigenous wives.]]

The Spanish traveled to [[Central America]] in the 15th century to discover a lush world, which was inhabited by many Native American indigenous civilizations. To the cultures of Europe, Central America was mysterious, primal and terrifying. [[El Salvador]] has lush, tropical rainforests that cover much of its volcanic surface and the geology of El Salvador is strongly affected by the presence of volcanoes, ellecuent with highly nutritious soil full of mineral, excellent for agriculture. These properties made it highly valued by Europeans, who exploited it for transport back to Spain. When the Europeans began to search El Salvador for valuable metals, the natives were appalled and angered by the destruction of their tropical home and felt that the damage done by Europeans in the pursuit of underground metals was nothing more than senseless destruction that violated the basic tenets of their beliefs. The expansion of the Spanish mining colony and smallpox threatened the continued existence of the indigenous natives in El Salvador. Despite its small size, El Salvador had a plethora of diverse civilizations with many languages and cultures, but expansion of the Spanish colony threatened the continued existence of the Lenca, Maya and Pipil, Native American people indigenous to El Salvador.

When [[Pedro de Alvarado]] arrived in the [[Cuzcatlan]] kingdom, he saw that all civilians, women, children and elders, in towns and large urban centers had been mandatorily evacuated to a safe unknown location. The warriors of Cuzcatan had deployed to their battle stations in Acajutla and waited for Pedro de Alvarado and his forces in that coastal city. Pedro de Alvarado approached confident trusting that the result was going to be like in Mexico and Guatemala where the people saw them as gods, and thought he was going to easily defeat this new indigenous force because his Mexican allies and the Pipil of Cuzcatlan spoke a similar language and communication was going to be easy and fast. However unlike in Mexico and Guatemala, the Indigenous peoples of El Salvador never saw the Spanish as gods, but as foreign, gold lusting, barbaric, alien invaders who would resort to anything to steal away their land. Once Pedro de Alvarado arrived, he saw the shock troops of the Cuzcatlan kingdom in [[Acajutla]] ready for battle, he saw that the Cuzcatan force had a significantly large number of soldiers, which easily outnumbers his Spanish soldiers and Mexican Indian allies, once he saw this he order his army for the first time to quickly retreat, but the Cuzcatlec army was not satisfied by this and made a decisive shock and awe attack on the Spanish army, running behind them war chanting and shooting bow arrows, Pedro de Alvarado had no choice but to fight to survive. Pedro de Alvarado describes the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail with shields made of colorful exotic feathers, a vest-like armor made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate and large spears. The Cuzcatlec soldiers were so fully armed, that those who were wounded by the Spanish guns and swords, found it difficult to get up because of their wounds and heavy armor. Both armies suffered great casualties, a wounded Pedro de Alvarado retreated losing a lot of men especially close Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had gathered Pedro de Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan metropolis capital; however, half way the same Cuzcatlan army was waiting for them.

Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Pedro de Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec platoons to see if they would fear the horses, however the Indigenous warriors stood their ground and did not move an inch, as Pedro de Alvarado recalls in his letters to [[Hernan Cortez]]. Pedro de Alvarado was so stunned and imprinted with their monumental military power and size which he described as large number of male warriors in colorful feather armors and long spears, a large army of indigenous men which eerily spooked him. The Cuzcatlec shock troops made another decisive shock and awe attacked on the Spanish on which both sides lost men, but this time Pedro de Alvarado lost many Spaniards, horses, and weapons which the Natives of Cuzcatlan had taken.

Pedro de Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to communicate with the Cuzcatlan warriors, Pedro de Alvarado sent for them to return the stolen weapons and to surrender to the Spanish king, to which the Cuzcatecs responded with the famous response, "If you want your weapons, come get them". As days passed, Pedro de Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messenger never came back and were presumably executed. The Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Lenca and their Mayan-speaking neighbors, defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican Tlaxcala Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala, it was Pedro de Alvarado first defeat.

After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, Gonzalo de Alvarado, to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the [[Pipil people|Pipil]] under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of smallpox. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatlán was completed and the city of San Salvador was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the [[Lencas]].

===Lenca resistance battle===
[[File:Spanish Conqueror.jpg|thumb|[[Spaniard]] colonizers began settling in El Salvador and taking native wives, producing a high birth rate boom of mestizo children which make up today's modern Salvadoran population.]]
{{unreferenced|date=July 2018|section}}
In 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador| San Miguel]] , headed by another explorer and conquistador, [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]], nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a [[Mayan people|Maya]]-[[Lenca]] crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.

The kingdom of [[Lenca]] was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day [[El Salvador]] and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]] and destroy the garrison.

For ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of Intibucá.

Antu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.

Historical evidence and census supports the explanation of "strong sexual asymmetry", as a result of a strong bias favoring matings between European males and Native American females, and to the important indigenous male mortality during the Conquest. The genetics thus suggests the native men were sharply reduced in numbers due to the war and disease. Large numbers of Spaniard men settled in the region and married or forced themselves with the local women. The Natives were forced to adopted Spanish names, language, and religion, and in this way, the Lencas, Mayas and Pipil women and children were Hispanicized. A vast majority over 90% of Salvadorans are Mestizo/Native American. Conservative figures say the Mestizo and Native American populations make up 87% of the populations and semi-Liberal figures say that the Native American population reaches upwards to 13% of the population plus the high percentage of [[Mestizo]] making [[El Salvador]] a highly Native American nation.

The history of El Salvador has been a struggle against many conquistadors, empires, dictatorships and world powers that would seal El Salvador's fate in the future. After gaining independence, several Spanish Creoles took control of the government and economy. El Salvador's population was further put into stress, turmoil, frustration, and ire which would condition a society with a cycle of a never ending violent nature. [[Feliciano Ama]] and [[Anastasio Aquino]], king of the Nonoualquenos, led a rebellions against what was referred to as an abuse of power and corruption, but it was repressed by the government with genocide. These occurrences would also motivate [[Prudencia Ayala]], [[Farabundo Martí]] and ultimately [[Óscar Romero]].
 
This repression would have repercussions for the future of El Salvador. La matanza [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre]], and all the liberation movements from the 1930s to 1980s, [[Salvadoran Civil War]] and even the current [[Mara (gang)]] phenomenon would emerge from the injustices committed by Spanish rule, Creoles, and other foreign power interventions.

The 1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre occurred on January 22 of that year, in the western departments of El Salvador when a brief peasant-led rebellion was suppressed by the government, then led by Maximiliano Hernández Martínez. The Salvadoran army, being vastly superior in terms of weapons and soldiers, executed those who stood against it. The rebellion was a mixture of protest and insurrection and ended in ethnocide, claiming the lives of anywhere between 10,000 and 40,000 peasants and other civilians, many of them indigenous people.

The [[Salvadoran Civil War]] was a conflict between the military-led government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), a coalition or "umbrella organization" of five left-wing guerrilla groups. A coup on October 15, 1979, led to the killings of anti-coup protesters by the government as well as anti-disorder protesters by the guerrillas, and is widely seen as the tipping point toward civil war. The full-fledged civil war lasted for more than 12 years and saw extreme violence from both sides. It also included the deliberate terrorizing and targeting of civilians by death squads, recruitment of child soldiers and other violations of human rights, mostly by the military. An unknown number of people disappeared during the conflict, and the UN reports that more than 75,000 were killed.

On top of the recurring natural disasters such as massive destructive earthquakes, cyclonic systems and volcanic activity, the constant war atmosphere in El Salvador including the prehistoric wars in Mesoamerica times the colonization of the Spaniards, the independence wars, the oppression of later ruthless dictatorships, the 1932 indigenous massacre, the Central American proxy wars in the 70's, the civil war in El Salvador in the 1980s and the current gang war, have all put a heavy hinder-age in the development of El Salvador and left the Salvadoran society vulnerable and prone to interpersonal violence

The exodus of Salvadorans was a result of both economic and political problems. The largest immigration wave occurred as a result of the Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s, in which 20%-30% of El Salvador's population emigrated. About 50% percent, or up to 500,000 of those who escaped the country headed to the U.S., which was already home to over 10,000 Salvadorans. The number of Salvadoran immigrants in the United States continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of family reunification and new arrivals fleeing a series of natural disasters that hit El Salvador, including earthquakes and hurricanes. Gang warfare, which made El Salvador one of the dangerous countries in the world, also contributed to the surge of immigrants seeking asylum in the late part of the 2000s and the first four years in the 2010 decade, by 2008, there were about 1.1 million Salvadoran immigrants in the United States.

[[El Salvador]] has the largest population density in [[Latin America]], and is the third most populated country in [[Central America]] after [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]], from the 2005 census, the population exceeds 6 million. The total impact of civil wars, dictatorships and socioeconomics drove over a million Salvadorans (both as immigrants and refugees) into the [[Salvadoran American|United States]]; [[Guatemala]] is the second country that hosts more Salvadorans behind the [[United States]], approximately 110,000 Salvadorans according to the national census of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gob.gt/index.php/demografia-y-poblacion/42-demografiaypoblacion/207-infodemo2010|title=Institución|website=Ine.gob.gt|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition small Salvadoran communities sprung up in [[Salvadoran Canadian|Canada]], [[Salvadoran Australian|Australia]], [[Belize]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Italy]], and [[Sweden]] since the migration trend began in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapa de las Migraciones Salvadoreñas|url=http://www.pnud.org.sv/2007/content/view/1184/122/|website=Pnud.org.sv|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 U.S. Census counted 1,648,968 Salvadorans in the United States, up from 655,165 in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/|title=American FactFinder|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=Factfinder2.census.gov|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, the figured had risen to over 2.3 million.&lt;ref name=2017AmericanCommunitySurvey/&gt;

==Racial and ethnic groups==
{{main|Demographics of El Salvador}}
[[File:HombresSalvadoreñosSalvadoranMen.jpg|thumb|Young Salvadoran men from the El Salvador national soccer team]]
[[El Salvador]]'s [[population]] numbers 6,377,358. Ethnically, 86.3% of Salvadorans are mixed (mixed Indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[Spanish people|European]] Spanish origin). Another 12.7% is of pure European descent, other 0.23% are pure Native American indigenous descent, 0.13% black people and others 0.64%.

===Mestizo Salvadorans===
{{main|Mestizos in El Salvador}}
86.3% of the population are [[mestizo]], having mixed Native American indigenous and European ancestry.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/es.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- El Salvador |accessdate=2013-10-12 |publisher=CIA }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mestizo population, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as [[Afro-Salvadoran]], and the Native American people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages or have and indigenous culture, all identify themselves as being culturally mestizo.

===Indigenous Salvadorans===

]]
According to the Salvadoran Government, about 0.23% of the population are of full indigenous origin. The largest most dominant Native American groups in El Salvador are the [[Lenca people]], [[Cacaopera people]], [[Maya peoples]]: ([[Poqomam people]]/[[Chorti people]]) and [[Pipil people]]. However the small culture enclaves of [[Xinca people]], [[Alaguilac people]], [[Mixe people]], [[Mangue language]] people became extinct through the [[Mestizo]] process, the country also had an [[Olmec]] past. ([[Pipil people|Pipil]], located in the west and central part of the country, and [[Lenca people|Lenca]], found east of the [[Lempa River]]). There are small populations of [[Cacaopera people]] in the [[Morazán Department]] and a few [[Ch'orti' people]] live in the department of [[Ahuachapán]], near the border of [[Guatemala]].

The number of indigenous people in El Salvador have been criticized by indigenous organizations and academics as too small and accuse the government of denying the existence of indigenous Salvadorans in the country. Nonetheless, very few Amerindians have retained their customs and traditions, having over time assimilated into the dominant Mestizo/Spanish culture. The low numbers of indigenous people may be partly explained by historically high rates of old-world diseases, absorption into the mestizo population, as well as mass murder during the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]] (or ''La Matanza'') which saw (estimates of) up to 30,000 [[peasants]] killed in a short period of time. Many authors note that since ''La Matanza'' the indigenous in El Salvador have been very reluctant to describe themselves as such (in census declarations for example) or to wear indigenous dress or be seen to be taking part in any cultural activities or customs that might be understood as indigenous. Departments and cities in the country with notable indigenous populations include [[Sonsonate]] (especially [[Izalco]], [[Nahuizalco]], and [[Santo Domingo, Sonsonate|Santo Domingo]]), [[Cacaopera]], and [[Panchimalco]], in the department of [[San Salvador Department|San Salvador]].

===White Salvadorans===
[[File:Salvadorianchildren.JPG|thumb|Salvadoran Children.]]
Some 12.7% of Salvadorans are [[White Latin American|white]]. This population is mostly made up of ethnically [[Spanish people]], while there are also Salvadorans of [[French people|French]], [[Germans|German]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Italian people|Italian]] descent. In northern departments like the [[Chalatenango Department]], it is well known that residents in the area are of pure Spanish descent; The governor of San Salvador, [[Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet]], ordered families from northern Spain ([[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]]) to settle the area to compensate for the lack of indigenous people to work the land; it is not uncommon to see people with blond hair, fair skin, and blue or green eyes in municipalities like [[Dulce Nombre de María]], [[La Palma, Chalatenango|La Palma]], and [[Cerro El Pital|El Pital]].

====Arab Salvadorans====
[[File:Bukele Conferencia.png|thumb|[[Palestinian Salvadoran]]
[[Nayib Bukele]], former mayor of [[San Salvador]] City]]
There is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zielger|first1=Matthew|title=El Salvador: Central American Palestine of the West?|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Art/2004/Apr-27/91857-el-salvador-central-american-palestine-of-the-west.ashx#axzz3EZpwYUKb|website=The Daily Star|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (especially from the area of [[Bethlehem]]), but also from Lebanon. [[Palestinian Salvadoran|Salvadorans of Palestinian descent]] numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent is around 25,000. There is also a small community of [[History of the Jews in El Salvador|Jews]] who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Turkey]].

===Pardo Salvadorans===
[[File:US Navy 090628-N-6259S-001 Capt. Amber Heller examines a Salvadoran child's teeth during a Continuing Promise 2009 medical community service project in Loma Larga, El Salvador.jpg|thumb|Salvadoran boy]]
[[Pardo]] is the term that was used in colonial El Salvador to describe a tri-racial Afro-Mestizo person of Indigenous, European, and African descent. [[Afro-Salvadoran]]s are the descendants of the African population that were enslaved and shipped to El Salvador to work in mines in specific regions of El Salvador. They have mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. Thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America. A total of only 10,000 African slaves were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador's colonization. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have   English Antillean (West Indian) or Garifuna populations of the Caribbean, but instead had older colonial African slaves that came straight from Africa. This is the reason why El Salvador is the only country in Central America not to have a caribbeanized culture, and instead preserved its classical Central America culture.

[[Mestizo]] culture dominates the country, heavy in both Native American Indigenous and European Spanish influences. A new composite population was formed as a result of intermarrying between the native [[Mesoamerican]] population of Cuzcatlan with the European settlers. The [[Catholic Church]] plays an important role in the Salvadoran culture. [[Archbishop Óscar Romero]] is a national hero for his role in resisting human rights violations that were occurring in the lead-up to the Salvadoran Civil War.&lt;ref name=Eaton&gt;Eaton, Helen-May (1991). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/116/ The impact of the Archbishop Óscar Romero's alliance with the struggle for liberation of the Salvadoran people: A discussion of church-state relations (El Salvador)]'' (M.A. thesis), Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt; Significant foreign personalities in El Salvador were the [[Jesuit]] priests and professors [[Ignacio Ellacuría]], [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]], and [[Segundo Montes]], who were murdered in 1989 by the Salvadoran Army during the height of the civil war.

Painting, ceramics and textiles are the principal manual artistic mediums.

'''Samuel Provance''' is a former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[military intelligence]] [[Sergeant#United States|sergeant]], known for disobeying an order from his commanders in the [[302nd Military Intelligence Battalion]] by discussing with the media his experiences at the [[Abu Ghraib Prison]], where he was assigned from September 2003 to February 2004.  After being disciplined for his actions, he eventually brought his case to the United States Government in February 2006, resulting in a Congressional subpoena of the Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]].  The main points of his testimony are that military intelligence soldiers and contracted civilian interrogators had abused detainees, that they directed the military police to abuse detainees, the extent of this knowledge at the prison, and the subsequent cover-up of these practices when investigated.

Military intelligence soldiers from the [[205th Military Intelligence Brigade]], with firsthand knowledge, had in fact spoken with the media weeks before Provance did, which corroborate his claims, saying they wanted to "do what's right ... get the truth out," but they chose to remain anonymous, "because of concern that their military careers would be ruined."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/bal-te.guard09may09,0,1262306,full.story?coll=orl-jobs-utility |title=Orlandosentinel.com |access-date=2010-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604104207/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/bal-te.guard09may09,0,1262306,full.story?coll=orl-jobs-utility |archive-date=2011-06-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the military police themselves said they were ordered and encouraged by interrogators to treat detainees harshly, to "soften" them up for interrogations, and were commended by their commander for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-01-13/news/17356794_1_charles-graner-abu-ghraib-graner-first SFgate.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Provance was assigned to Abu Ghraib prison (also known as the Baghdad Correctional Facility) shortly after a mortar attack at the prison killed and wounded several soldiers from his unit on September 20, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-09-21-iraq_x.htm USAtoday.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Though an [[intelligence analyst]] supporting the [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] during the initial phase of [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]], under the command of General [[William S. Wallace]], at Abu Ghraib he supervised the [[systems administration]] on the so-called "infamous" night shift, under the command of Lieutenant General [[Ricardo S. Sanchez]].

In January 2004, the same month that saw the unexplained death of his Command Sergeant Major Stacy Adams,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,Defensewatch_052504_Galland,00.html Military.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Provance was interviewed by a [[US Army Criminal Investigation Command]] (CID) agent, as part of Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]'s investigation of Abu Ghraib.  Taguba considered Provance a witness based on his sworn statement.  His name, along with other witnesses, were made known in May 2004 when the classified [[Taguba Report]] was deliberately leaked to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walt |first=Vivienne |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,634638,00.html |title=Military Personnel: Don't Read This! |publisher=TIME |date=2004-05-08 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provance was also interviewed by Major General [[George Fay]], the lead investigator of a second major investigation of Abu Ghraib.  Provance later claimed Fay was more interested in the military police in the photographs, not of intelligence operations (Fay was charged with investigating military intelligence).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41035-2004May19.html Washingtonpost.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  He also claimed Fay resisted his testimony (largely the same provided to Taguba), who afterward decided to recommend charges of "dereliction of duty" against him for not coming forward any sooner, saying if he had, he could have prevented the scandal.

Provance was then issued an order by his company commander, Captain Scott Hedberg, and subsequently his battalion commander, Lt. Colonel James Norwood, not to communicate with anyone about his experiences at Abu Ghraib.  Perceiving the threat of charges and the [[gag order]] as part of a larger "cover-up", Provance spoke with the media, hoping they would investigate where the military was apparently failing to.  His [[top secret]] security clearance was suspended and he was administratively "flagged" (a career hold) for 16 months, until he was given an Article 15 ([[Nonjudicial punishment|non-judicial punishment]]).  This began with the May 18, 2004 broadcast of [[ABC World News]] Tonight with [[Peter Jennings]], where he said, "there's definitely a cover-up...people are either telling themselves or being told to be quiet...many people are probably hiding and wishing to God that this storm passes without them having to be investigated [or] personally looked at".&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=131658&amp;page=1 ABCnews.go.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]], Provance, "still speaks passionately about his dedication to the Army and condemns the few leaders above him".  Provance told them, "I would never speak out against the Army, that's not what I'm doing...the Army is an awesome organization that I respect and honor...it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=21598&amp;archive=true Estripes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2004 former Vice President [[Al Gore]] referred to Provance during a speech at New York University, as the Abu Ghraib scandal evolved into a heated political debate, with the Presidential election coming up that November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moveon.org/pac/gore-rumsfeld-transcript.html Moveon.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914002024/http://www.moveon.org/pac/gore-rumsfeld-transcript.html |date=2007-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, [[Jerry Fleishman]] wrote a profile of Provance for the [[Los Angeles Times]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axisoflogic.com/cgi-bin/exec/view.pl?archive=62&amp;num=9175&amp;printer=1 Axisoflogic.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Provance speaks in a near-whisper, but he possesses a steely defiant streak".  It was reported that he studied to be a Christian [[Pastor]] at [[Holmes College of the Bible]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], "quitting...after raising too many questions about faith and fundamentalism".  He then joined the US Army, enlisting in [[Air Defense Artillery]], later tried out for [[Special Forces]], and then reclassified into Military Intelligence.  Despite his circumstances as a result of the Abu Ghraib investigations and scandal, "he reveres the spirit of the combat soldier", and worried that this was now in jeopardy.  The German newspaper [[Tageszeitung]] also wrote a profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2004/06/25/a0145 Taz.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 2004 the German news program "Report Mainz" broadcast an interview with Provance, where he revealed that children were detained at Abu Ghraib.  In response, the Norwegian government joined the Red Cross and Amnesty International in protest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article823183.ece Aftenposten.no] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411135056/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article823183.ece |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Ronson]] published the book [[The Men Who Stare at Goats]], later made into a motion picture in 2009.  Provance, under the name "Joseph Curtis" to protect his identity at that time, is in a chapter named "The Haunted Hotel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003E7ET0I |title=The Men Who Stare at Goats: Jon Ronson: 8581000012542: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television's [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), as a part of its documentary program, [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)]], features Provance's perspective in the documentary "''The Torture Question''", in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/torture/ |title=The Torture Question &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional testimonies==
In September 2004, Provance was sent to Washington D.C. to speak with [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] staff, in preparation for a Congressional hearing of Major General Fay's investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,Defensewatch_091004_Galland,00.html Military.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has not been made public what happened during these meetings or why they were held.[[File:kellertimes.jpg|thumb|right|Coverage in [[Army Times]]]]

In February 2006, Provance testified before Congress alongside Lieutenant Colonel [[Anthony Shaffer (intelligence officer)]] from the US Army, [[Michael German (terrorism)|Michael German]] from the [[FBI]], and [[Russell D. Tice]] from the [[NSA]].  He testified that at his [[Article 15]] proceeding in July 2005, he was threatened with up to ten years in military prison if he did not accept the terms of punishment.  He accepted the terms, and for "disobeying a lawful order", he was demoted in rank.  He also testified about many other things before unknown or not as detailed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/06214-usls-provance-statment.pdf Humanrightsfirst.info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103150714/http://www.humanrightsfirst.info/pdf/06214-usls-provance-statment.pdf |date=2006-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressman [[Chris Shays]] (R-CT), the committee chairman, said to Provance, "I just want to say to you it takes a tremendous amount of courage with your rank to tell a General what they may not want to hear, and people like you will help move our country in the right direction.  And so this full committee thanks you for what you have done."&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/congress/2006_hr/whistle.html Fas.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, Provance's interview with Report Mainz was selected among other news stories in its forty-year broadcasting history for recognition.  He gave an update on that television event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swr.de/report/-/id=233454/nid=233454/did=1200446/z06t7f/index.html SWR.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 6, 2006 the [[New York Times]] reported that the [[House Committee on Government Reform]] issued a subpoena to [[Secretary of Defense]] Donald Rumsfeld because he had not responded to a March 7, 2006 request for information regarding Provance's demotion and testimony.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/washington/06subpoena.html?fta=y NYtimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Four months later, Rumsfeld resigned, citing Abu Ghraib as his "darkest hour", and ignored the subpoena.

==Post Army==

Provance was [[honorably discharged]] from the United States Army in October 2006 in Heidelberg, Germany.

In November 2006, Provance spoke to a group of 350 people in [[Maplewood, New Jersey]] and received a certificate of appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.njpeaceaction.org/peacemaker/07-01newsfinal.pdf |title=NJpeaceaction.org |access-date=2010-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727124334/http://www.njpeaceaction.org/peacemaker/07-01newsfinal.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Provance appeared in a [[HBO]] documentary, ''[[Ghosts of Abu Ghraib]]'', where he describes the prison as, "''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' meets ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''."  An extended interview is included in the DVD release.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NY0YK4 Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  He later wrote an article about his experience at a screening of the film in Washington DC, criticizing Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] (R-SC), who had also been in attendance for a post-screening discussion with Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] (D-MA), for changing his opinions of Abu Ghraib since he'd been in contact with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coldtype.net/Assets.07/Essays/0407.Reader13.pdf Coldtype.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tara McKelvey]] published the book, "''Monstering: Inside America's Policy of Secret Interrogations and Torture in the Terror War''", which includes Provance's story most in-depth.  She describes him as, "unconventional...a keen sense of injustice".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465005462 Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The New York Times]], in a book review, reported, "if the United States still has a chance of winning the battle for the hearts and minds of the Muslim world, then we have people like Provance to thank".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/books/review/Mahler-t.html?ex=1343361600&amp;en=56f9647b765a1ac6&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss NYtimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2007 Provance was given the [[Sam Adams Award]] for "integrity in intelligence" at the [[American University]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Horton, ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers.org]]'', 21 September 2007, [http://harpers.org/blog/2007/09/sam-adams-award-to-sam-provance/ Sam Adams Award to Sam Provance]&lt;/ref&gt;  He described missing the Army "more than anything else", and that after having lost his friends and family, speaking to the media was not worth it on a personal level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/node/27031 Afterdowningstreet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

An interview with Provance was broadcast on the [[Democracy Now!]] television program with [[Amy Goodman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Democracy Now]], 25 January 2008, [http://www.democracynow.org/2008/1/25/broadcast_exclusive_abu_ghraib_whistleblower_samuel Democracynow.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  He lamented that "even to this day...there's been nobody else that has had their conscience bother them to come forward and say, look, this is what was really going on, and that it wasn't just these MP's, and that these MP's were really doing what they were told".

Provance wrote a critical editorial about the documentary, "[[Standard Operating Procedure]]", directed by Oscar-winning director [[Errol Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Sam Provance, 30 April 2008, [[consortiumnews.com]], [http://www.consortiumnews.com/2008/043008b.html Abu Ghraib Film Obscures Truth ]&lt;/ref&gt;  He claims Morris promised, "a no-holds-barred documentary", but instead only "focuses on the awful photos, the people in them and those who took them".  Portions of his interview with Morris, cut from the film's release, are however on the [[Blu-ray Disc]] edition's special features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdcorner.net/reviews/hd_reviews/standard_operating_procedure_Blu-ray.html DVDcorner.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20081017044818/http://www.dvdcorner.net/reviews/hd_reviews/standard_operating_procedure_Blu-ray.html |date=2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provance gave a radio interview for [[Chicago Public Radio]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Chicago Public Radio]], [http://www.chicagopublicradio.org/content.aspx?audioID=26519 Chicagopublicradio.org]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying he wished he had exhausted more "official channels", but that it is speculation to say if that would have changed anything.  He wanted to discuss things more with his leadership, but having reprimanded him for bizarre things like not doing their laundry or not washing vehicles with water they were rationing, he felt they could not be trusted.  He wanted to testify on behalf of the military police at their trials, but like in [[Lynndie England]]'s case, her lawyers were erroneously told he could not be found.  He compared his plight to [[Serpico]], but instead of meeting the same fate, says he still loves being a soldier and could return to the Army, though he fears his career would be sabotaged by "higher-ups" who might fear he has ulterior motives.

On October 22, 2009, Provance was given a letter of commendation signed by former President [[Jimmy Carter]] and 15,000 others, for his "uncommon courage in defending the rule of law and standing up against torture".  In his acceptance of the letter, he responded, "if and when we do the right thing, we may not ever know to what extent our words and actions are ever used by other people, or even God, but you can be sure that they will be".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consortiumnews.com/2009/102309b.html Consortiumnews.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Days later he was interviewed by [[Karen Kwiatkowski]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanfreedomradio.com/archive/American_Forum_32k_103009_Hr_2.mp3 Americanfreedomradion.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204201601/http://www.americanfreedomradio.com/archive/American_Forum_32k_103009_Hr_2.mp3 |date=2010-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; his final words being, "not to give up on the Army or our country...there are still good people doing good things".

On May 7, 2013, the documentary, "[[Doctors of the Darkside]]";&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B2TU38C amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ", produced and directed by [[Martha Davis (filmmaker)|Martha Davis]], is dedicated, "to Sam Provance and the courage to bear witness", and is screened internationally to raise awareness of "the critical role of physicians and psychologists in detainee torture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctorsofthedarkside.com/ doctorsofthedarkside.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2013, photographer [[Jo Metson Scott]] published the book "[[The Grey Line]]";&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/The-Grey-Line-Metson-Scott/dp/1907893326/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379028949&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+grey+line+jo+metson+scott Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ", which documents, "the perspective of US and UK soldiers who have spoken out against the Iraq War".  Provance is featured on the front cover, and a synopsis of his story is in the book.

'''Wilfred Talbot Smith''' (born '''Frank Wenham'''; 8 June 1885 – 27 April 1957) was an English [[occultism|occultist]] and [[ceremonial magic]]ian known as a prominent advocate of the religion of [[Thelema]]. Living most of his life in North America, he played a key role in propagating Thelema across the continent.

Born the illegitimate son of a domestic servant and her employer in [[Tonbridge]], [[Kent]], Smith migrated to Canada in 1907, where he went through a variety of jobs and began reading about [[Western esotericism]]. Through [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]] he was introduced to the writings of Thelema's founder, [[Aleister Crowley]]. He subsequently joined Crowley's Thelemite order, the [[A∴A∴]], and the Thelemite wing of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.). In 1915, he joined the O.T.O.'s British Columbia Lodge No. 1, based in [[Vancouver]], and rose to become one of its senior members.

In 1922 Smith moved to [[Los Angeles]] in the United States, where he, [[Jane Wolfe]], and [[Regina Kahl]] tried to establish a new Thelemite community. They founded an incorporated Church of Thelema which gave weekly public performances of the [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|Gnostic Mass]] from their home in Hollywood. Seeking to revive the inactive North American O.T.O., in 1935 Smith then founded the O.T.O. [[Agape Lodge]], which subsequently relocated to [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. He brought a number of prominent Thelemites into the O.T.O., including [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]] and [[Grady Louis McMurtry]], but he had a strained relationship with both Crowley and Crowley's North American deputy, [[Karl Germer]], who eventually ousted him from his position as Agape Lodge leader, replacing him with Parsons. Smith retreated to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], where he continued to practice Thelema until his death.

==Early life==

===Youth: 1885&amp;ndash;1914===
Smith was born as Frank Wenham in [[Tonbridge]], Kent, on 9 June 1885.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=2, 4}} He was the illegitimate son of Oswald Cox, a member of a prominent local family who resided at Marl Field House, and one of his domestic servants, Minnie Wenham, whom Frank would never come to know.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=3&amp;ndash;5}} Considered an embarrassment by the wealthy Cox family, from an early age he was sent away to live with relatives, and aged four sent to a boarding school where he was physically abused by staff before being removed from the institution by his paternal grandmother, who took him for a year in Switzerland.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=5&amp;ndash;6}} From 1899 to 1901, he studied at [[Bedales School]], where he developed his lifelong hobby of [[book binding]], before becoming the apprentice to a cabinet maker in [[Kendal]] until 1906.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=6}}

With few ties in Britain, he decided to emigrate to Canada, arriving in [[Nova Scotia]] in 1907, where he gained work on a farm in [[Saskatchewan]]. From 1909 to 1911 he worked at a confectioner's warehouse, and then for a further nine months at a logging camp, before gaining a job as an accounting clerk at the [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] in April 1912.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=8}} He had come to loath Christianity and the Victorian moral systems that he associated with it; instead he began reading about [[Eastern religions|Eastern religion]], [[yoga]], and [[Western esotericism]].{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=8&amp;ndash;9}} While at work, he met [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]], a Thelemite who shared Smith's interest in these subjects and who lent him copies of [[Aleister Crowley]]'s ''[[Magick (Book 4)|Book 4]]'' and volume one, number one of ''[[The Equinox]]''.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=9&amp;ndash;11}} Intrigued, Smith paid to join Crowley's Britain-based magical order, the [[A∴A∴]], in doing so obtaining more of Crowley's writings. He began performing many of the practices encouraged by the group, including yoga and the keeping of a diary recording his magical endeavours.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=12&amp;ndash;13}}

Smith entered into a relationship with a woman twenty years his senior, Emily Sophia "Nem" Talbot Smith, although it remains unclear whether they ever married. With Nem and her daughter Katherine, Smith moved into a specially-constructed house designed by the Thelemite architect [[Howard E. White]]. Located at 138 East 13th Street, North Vancouver, Smith converted the attic into a temple for Thelemic rituals.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=14&amp;ndash;17}}

===O.T.O. British Columbia Lodge No. 1: 1915&amp;ndash;1922===

[[File:Aleister Crowley.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Crowley, of whom Smith became a devotee.]]
Smith also decided to join the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.), an occult organisation whose British branch, the Mysteria Magica Maxima (MMM), was run by Crowley, who used it to promote Thelema. In January 1915, Smith signed up to the MMM, and in April went through the [[Ordo Templi Orientis#Initiation and teachings|Minerval degree]] initiation at the British Columbia Lodge No. 1.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=18, 31&amp;ndash;32}} In May, he took part in the Lodge's public performance of the [[Rites of Isis]], which it was hoped would attract further members.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=35&amp;ndash;36}} In a private capacity, he meanwhile continued performing his A∴A∴ practices, and also began experimenting with the [[entheogen]]ic properties of [[anhalonium]].{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=37}} In October 1915, Crowley visited the Lodge, where he met with Smith.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=38&amp;ndash;40|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2p=199}} Soon after, Smith would be upgraded to the position of Master Magician within the Lodge, and in March 1916 received the [[A∴A∴#Probationer|Probationer level]] in the A∴A∴, adopting as his personal magical motto the Latin words ''Nubem Eripiam'' ("I will snatch away the cloud").{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=42, 48}}

Smith's relationship with Nem was strained, and he began an affair with his step-daughter, Katherine. In November 1916, the three of them tried to resign from the O.T.O. lodge so as to prevent their problems affecting the group. Their resignations were rejected, and by January 1917 they were once again active within the lodge.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=58&amp;ndash;64}} Nevertheless, in March the lodge shut down for 13 months, during which time Crowley and Jones scrutinised Smith's diaries to ascertain his magical progress.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=64&amp;ndash;66}} Katherine became pregnant with Smith's child, who was born in December 1917, and named Noel Talbot-Smith. Jones proclaimed that Noel represented "the Crowned and Conquering Child" prophecised in the main Thelemite holy book, ''[[The Book of the Law]]''.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=68, 82}} Jones was soon named O.T.O. Viceroy for Canada, and in April he re-initiated the lodge at Smith's home, with Smith himself being appointed the lodge's Right Worshipful Master.{{Sfn|Starr|2003|pp=88}} Jones himself claimed that he had undergone a "Great Initiation" and was now an [[A∴A∴#Ipsissimus|Ipsissimus]]; his relationship with Crowley broke down, and he subsequently resigned from the O.T.O., deeply disappointing Smith.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=83&amp;ndash;84, 90&amp;ndash;91}}

Smith meanwhile continued working towards the A∴A∴ grade of [[A∴A∴#Zelator|Zelator]], while the British Columbia Lodge No. 1 became increasingly moribund following the death of White, a key member, who had succumbed to [[Spanish Flu]] aged 33 in November 1918.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=91&amp;ndash;92}} Jones had rejoined the O.T.O. and relocated to Detroit in the United States. When Smith was fired from his job following a bout of flu in February 1920, he decided to join Jones in Detroit, where there was a small O.T.O. community; there he gained work as a clerk with the [[Detroit City Gas Company]]. In his absence, Nem was appointed Right Worshipful Master of the Vancouver lodge.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=96, 103&amp;ndash;104|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=350}} In March 1921, Jones and Smith proceeded to Chicago, but in June Smith returned to North Vancouver to see his family.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=107&amp;ndash;108}} That year, Jones convinced Smith to join an esoteric organisation known as the [[Universal Brotherhood (esoteric order)|Universal Brotherhood]] (UB). Smith however was unnerved that rather than expressing a Thelemic viewpoint, the UB adhered to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], and he also considered its literature purposeless, vague, and grandiose; he soon dropped out.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=17&amp;ndash;120}} Back in Vancouver, Smith aided one of his initiates, Frank Page, in founding the British Columbia Lodge No. 3 in [[Kamloops]], creating all the furniture for their temple. Nevertheless, the lodge closed after a year, with Smith's own British Columbia Lodge No. 1 also becoming defunct in February 1922.{{Sfn|Starr|2003|pp=120&amp;ndash;123}}

===Los Angeles: 1922&amp;ndash;1935===

Unable to find work in Vancouver, Smith headed to Los Angeles in California, United States. On the way he stopped at San Francisco, where he met with [[C.F. Russell|Cecil Frederick Russell]], a Thelemite who had departed from the Crowleyan orthodoxy to found his own group, the Choronzon Club. Smith however disliked Russell, and later claimed that he had been unnerved when Russell began expressing [[paedophilia|a sexual interest in children]].{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=125&amp;ndash;129}} After settling in Los Angeles, Smith gained a job at the [[Southern California Gas Company]], entered into a relationship with a woman named Ann Barry, and began attending occasional meetings of the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]], an esoteric organisation centred in the city. Jones meanwhile had united Thelema with [[auto-suggestion]] to found his own group, the [[Psychomagian Society]] (PMS), and he appointed Smith to be its Local Recorder for Los Angeles; out of friendship to Jones, Smith did so, but was uninterested in the PMS' teachings.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=131&amp;ndash;138}} Through their correspondences, Crowley came to reject the PMS and relations between himself and Jones once again broke down, this time permanently. Smith retained much affection for Jones, whom he saw as his mentor and friend, but nevertheless agreed with Crowley over the PMS and also rejected Jones' ongoing fascination with the UB, which Smith considered incompatible with Thelema; their relationship too came to an end in 1926.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=140&amp;ndash;162}}

Now based in Los Angeles, Smith applied for US citizenship but was rejected, due to the fact that in his application he had claimed to be married but he was unable to prove with paperwork.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=138}} Seeking to promote Thelema in the city, he adopted his own student, Oliver Jacobi, whom he mentored in the A∴A∴ system,{{Sfn|Starr|2003|p=168}} and in the autumn of 1927, he developed a close friendship with fellow Thelemite and Hollywood actress [[Jane Wolfe]].{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=170&amp;ndash;172|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=468}} Although he continued to have sexual relationships with other women, Smith retained his love for Katherine, who came to visit him in Los Angeles, where they were legally married on 24 August 1927 at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, the day before she returned to Montreal.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=169&amp;ndash;170}} She tried to get Smith to abandon occultism and Thelema and return to her in Canada, but he refused, leading her to file for divorce in May 1930, taking sole custody of their child.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=173&amp;ndash;175}} Smith continued to have sexual and romantic relationships with other women, and &amp;ndash; influenced by Crowley's [[bisexuality]] &amp;ndash; also experimented with same-sex sexual relations, but felt no attraction to men.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=176}} From July to September 1929, a married woman named Leota Schneider moved in with Smith, and they had an affair, but she soon returned to her husband, while from July to December 1930, Smith began undertaking [[sex magic]] rituals with Wolfe, although their relationship remained platonic.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=176&amp;ndash;179}} Smith soon met Regina Kahl and her sister Leona "Lee" Watson, whom he initiated into the O.T.O. in early 1931, with Regina also joining the A∴A∴. Smith had sexual relations with both sisters, but while Regina &amp;ndash; with whom his activity became [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] &amp;ndash; became romantically attached to him, Lee soon abandoned Thelema.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=180&amp;ndash;186}}

In 1932, Crowley, now based back in England, fell seriously ill, and believing his death to be immanent, he sent Smith a testament proclaiming that in the event of his death, Smith would become Frater Superior and Outer Head of the Order (OHO) of the O.T.O.; he soon however recovered.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=188|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2p=308}} In May of that year, Smith and Kahl began renting the large house at 1746 Winona Boulevard in Hollywood, and began to take in lodgers to help pay for it. Kahl and Wolfe began using the attic for Thelemic rituals, and in March 1933 they performed their first public [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|Gnostic Mass]] in the room, hoping to attract interested persons to Thelema. Crowley was pleased with their progress, and asked them to raise funds so that he could afford to visit.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=189&amp;ndash;195|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=468}} The weekly performances of the Gnostic Mass began to attract increasingly large crowds, with their "Crowley Nights" attracting around 150 guests, among them the film star [[John Carradine]].{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=119&amp;ndash;200}} In April 1934, Smith [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] the Church of Thelema under US law, although retained the North American O.T.O. as an unincorporated secret society. Crowley however was confused, and believed that Smith had incorporated the O.T.O., something which angered him; he subsequently complained about Smith in letters to other initiates.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=196&amp;ndash;200|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=485}} After an argument, Crowley and Smith ceased correspondence for a time.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=200&amp;ndash;201}} Smith also attempted to revive the largely defunct North American O.T.O., attracting 15 initial initiates, many of whom were dissatisfied members of the Choronzon Club, which was now in decline.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=224&amp;ndash;226|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2pp=486&amp;ndash;487}}

==Later life==

===The Agape Lodge: 1935&amp;ndash;1944===
[[File:Grady Louis McMurtry 1941.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Grady McMurtry was an early Lodge member. He later became head of the O.T.O..]]
With the O.T.O. now being revived in North America, Smith founded the Agape Lodge No. 1, based at his Hollywood home, and brought in 7 initiates to the [[Ordo Templi Orientis#Initiation and teachings|Minerval level]] in September 1935.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=227}} He advertised the foundation of his group through an advert in ''[[American Astrology]]'' magazine and printed a pamphlet explaining what the O.T.O. was.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=227}} The Agape Lodge held regular meetings, lectures, and study classes, as well as social events and a weekly Gnostic Mass open to the public.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=237}} In February 1936 they held a Mass in honour of [[Wayne Walker (New Thought)|Wayne Walker]], a proponent of [[New Thought]] who ran a group known as The Voice of Healing; they had hoped to attract Walker and his supporters to Thelema, but they were put off by the Lodge's sexual openness.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=235&amp;ndash;236}} Later that year, Smith and Jacobi's employer, the Southern California Gas Company, discovered their involvement in the Lodge, demoting Smith to bookkeeper and firing Jacobi. Angered, Jacobi left the Lodge altogether, while Smith shut down the group's private ritual activities for the next three years.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=239&amp;ndash;241}} As a result, the public attendance of the Gnostic Mass plummeted.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=246}}

Activities picked up again when Kahl, who worked as a drama teacher, brought three of her interested students into the group, among them [[Phyllis Seckler]], and other individuals also joined the group, among them Louis T. Culling and Roy Leffingwell. However, the rising number of members caused schisms and arguments, and the Lodge again ceased its private activities from March 1940 to March 1941.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=246&amp;ndash;252}} They returned to their activities to initiate a couple who had become interested in the O.T.O. through attending the Gnostic Mass, rocket scientist [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]] and his wife Helen. Parsons became enamored with Thelema,{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=252&amp;ndash;258}} although initially expressed both "repulsion and attraction" for Smith.{{sfn|Pendle|2005|p=136}} Smith wrote to Crowley, claiming that Parsons was "a really excellent man&amp;nbsp;... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself&amp;nbsp;... JP is going to be very valuable".{{sfnm|1a1=Pendle|1y=2005|1p=172}} The Parsons would help bring new members into the group; [[Grady McMurtry]] and his fiancee Claire Palmer, and Helen's sister [[Sara Northrup]].{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=266|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=169&amp;ndash;172}} In February 1939 a young college student who had attended the mass, Ayna Sosoyena, was murdered; although police drew no connection to the Lodge, sensationalist local tabloids connected the two, although were unaware that the Lodge was involved with Crowley or Thelema. A sympathetic local radio reporter allowed Smith to explain the purpose of the Mass to allay fears of the group, but the interview was never aired in an agreement with local press that they would drop the story.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=258&amp;ndash;262}}

By this point, the Agape Lodge was fully operational once more, although Crowley had remained highly critical of Smith, believing that he was failing to raise sufficient funds for Crowley's personal use. He appointed [[Karl Germer]], a German Thelemite recently arrived in the US, to be his representative on the continent, and instructed Germer to oversee the payment of dues to himself. He also specified that it would now be Germer, and not Smith, who was his chosen successor.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=263&amp;ndash;264}} Attempting to placate Crowley, in December 1941 Smith stated that all Lodge members now had to contribute 5% of their earnings as an "Emergency Fee" that went to Crowley.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=267}} Crowley's criticisms nevertheless continued, and Smith suffered a mild heart attack, retiring prematurely from work at the age of 56 before undergoing an operation to remove [[haemorroids]] in February 1942.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=268&amp;ndash;270}}

Smith decided to relocate Agape Lodge to a larger premises, renting the large house at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] from June 1942 for $100 a month, moving many of the lodge members into the house, living as a form of commune and raising livestock and vegetables in the grounds.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=271&amp;ndash;273, 276|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=207&amp;ndash;210}} Parsons had begun a relationship with Sara Northrup, while Smith consoled Helen, who would become his partner for the rest of his life; nevertheless the four remained friends.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=274|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2pp=93&amp;ndash;94|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=203&amp;ndash;205|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4p=537}} Although they had ceased to publicly perform the Gnostic Mass, membership of the lodge continued to grow.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=276&amp;ndash;277}} A number of prominent members however left, among them Regina Kahl and Phyllis Seckler.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=279}} Soon, both the FBI and the Pasadena police department began to investigate the O.T.O. and Agape Lodge, particularly as Germer, now leader of the North American O.T.O., was German; ultimately, they decided that the group was no threat to national security, describing it as a probable "love cult".{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=283&amp;ndash;285|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=214&amp;ndash;215}} Crowley however had remained highly critical of Smith's leadership of the lodge, and ordered Wolfe to send him on a personal magical retreat; she felt conflicted, but eventually conceded to Crowley's demands.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=278, 280&amp;ndash;282}} Both Crowley and Germer wanted to see Smith ousted permanently, believing that he had become a bad influence on the other lodge members; many of the members, including Jack and Helen Parsons, wrote to them to defend their mentor, but Germer nevertheless ordered him to stand down, with Parsons appointed head of the lodge.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=278, 280&amp;ndash;282|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=216&amp;ndash;217, 220}}

In April Helen gave birth to Smith's son, who was named Kwan Lanval Parsons.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1p=289|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2p=88|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3p=221}} In May, Smith and Helen left for a two-room cabin in [[Rainbow, California|Rainbow Valley]] with their baby, where Smith undertook his magical retirement.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=290&amp;ndash;291|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2pp=92&amp;ndash;93|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=221&amp;ndash;222}} Back in England, Crowley undertook an astrological analysis of Smith's birth chart, and came to the conclusion that he was the incarnation of a god, greatly altering his estimation of him; Smith however remained sceptical.{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=294&amp;ndash;298|2a1=Carter|2y=2004|2pp=90&amp;ndash;91|3a1=Pendle|3y=2005|3pp=221&amp;ndash;222}} Refusing to take orders from Germer any more, Smith resigned from the O.T.O., while Parsons &amp;ndash; who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict &amp;ndash; ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head. In a letter informing Crowley of this decision, Smith remarked "Would to God you knew your people better."{{sfnm|1a1=Starr|1y=2003|1pp=299&amp;ndash;300|2a1=Pendle|2y=2005|2pp=222&amp;ndash;223}} Germer subsequently appointed Max Schneider head of the Agape Lodge, which remained inactive, while Crowley, Germer, and Schneider began spreading lies about Smith, including that he was responsible for raping initiates, claims that were denied by many Lodge members.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=301&amp;ndash;302}}

===Final years: 1944&amp;ndash;1957===

In September 1944 Smith went on a second magical retirement, during which he performed [[pranayama]] and the [[lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram]], invoked [[Thoth]], and recited the [[Holy Books of Thelema]] from memory. During the retreat he learned that Kahl, his former lover, had died, which greatly upset him.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=307&amp;ndash;310}} Returning to his Pasadena home, he was welcomed by Parsons, but Crowley insisted that Smith be shunned by the lodge members, and so he moved back to Hollywood. Increasingly alienated by Crowley's attitude, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. in August 1946.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=311&amp;ndash;314}} Now renting a house, Smith sought out various handyman jobs, when he learned that Crowley had died and been succeeded as OHO of the O.T.O. by Germer.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=315&amp;ndash;315}} He became good friends with the art dealer Baron Ernst von Harringa, who commissioned Smith to construct Asian-style furniture for his gallery.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=322&amp;ndash;323}} Smith's own health was deteriorating, and in 1948 he suffered from a number of mild heart attacks. He nevertheless continued to believe in Thelema, and hoped to revive the Church of Thelema through performing the Gnostic Mass once more.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=319&amp;ndash;320}} Following Parsons' death in an explosion &amp;ndash; which Smith suspected was a case of suicide &amp;ndash; Smith was invited to perform the Gnostic Mass in his memory.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=327}}

Although they had long disliked each other, Germer recognised that Smith was the only living individual with a good practical knowledge of the O.T.O. degree system, and so put him in contact with [[Kenneth Grant]], who was then trying to revive the O.T.O. in London.{{Sfn|Starr|2003|p=324}} Smith and Germer would only meet in person for the first time in June 1956, when the latter was visiting California, and soon after Germer introduced him to young Brazilian Thelemite [[Marcelo Ramos Motta]], who would later grow to despise Smith.{{sfn|Starr|2003|pp=333&amp;ndash;336, 339}} Smith purchased a plot of land in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] where he built his own house for himself, Helen, and their son, which he named "Hoc Id Est" ("This Is It"). Construction was interrupted in February 1955 when he underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=332}} This developed into prostate cancer, and mistrusting of conventional medicine, he sought out an alternative treatment at the [[Hoxsey Therapy|Hoxsey Clinic]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], which he visited in December 1956, but they were unable to help him.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=338}} Smith died as a result of the disease at home on 27 April 1957, subsequently being cremated at the Grandview Memorial Park in Glendale.{{sfn|Starr|2003|p=340}}

==Legacy and influence==
''The Unknown God'' was reviewed by Robert Ellwood of the [[University of Southern California]] for the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions]]''. Ellwood described it as "the definitive work on American Crowleyanity", noting that it was the product of 15 years of "careful and documented" research. He praised "Starr's lucid style and the inherent fascination of the material, replete with vivid characters, epic rows, and sexual intrigue".{{sfn|Ellwood|2006|pp=125&amp;ndash;126}}

In 1986, he wrote an article entitled "The Drawback of Xie Jin's Model"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/reruns/hkrr2b.html ''Contemporary film theory in China''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318113504/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/reruns/hkrr2b.html |date=March 18, 2012 }}. ''Screening The Past''. 25 March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; (谢晋电影模式的缺陷) which was published in [[Wen Wei Po]] (文汇报）and which created quite a stir at home and abroad because he criticized the ways of filmmaking at that time. In the early 1990s, besides writing, he also broadcast music programs, organized painting exhibitions and worked on [[behavior art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://view.news.qq.com/a/20090504/000036.htm ''Zhu Dake: Silence is my last line'' (朱大可：沉默是我的最后底线)], ''QQ.com'', written by Liu Liu (刘溜), 4 May 2009, para 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Liumang (流氓) is a word meaning the rovers who have an anxious state of mind and who take a position of social rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Festival of Liumang'' (流氓的盛宴), written by Zhu Dake (朱大可), New Star Press, November 2006, page 14, line 5&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Zhu Dake divides Chinese society into the orthodox society and the Liumang’s society where order, faith, authority and ethics don't exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.com.cn/book/txt/2006-12/26/content_7559496.htm ''The Festival of Liumang: Stories of Liumang'' (流氓的盛宴：当代中国的流氓叙事)]. ''China.com.cn''. 12 December 2006. Para 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Examining three aspects, cool words (酷语), sexy words (色语) and abusive words (秽语),&lt;ref&gt;''The Festival of Liumang'' (流氓的盛宴), written by Zhu Dake (朱大可), New Star Press, November 2006, page 92&lt;/ref&gt; Zhu Dake researches, analyzes and elucidates thoroughly the existence of Liumang in all kinds of cultural forms, such as [[novels]], [[poetry]], [[art]], [[music]], etc. Zhu Dake reveals the features of Liumang in a vivid way because in this book, there are a great many of illustrations, including portraits, photos, posters, and paintings. [[Wei Yingjie]] (魏英杰), a famous Chinese writer and [[Pundit (expert)|commentator]], said that this book is a sort of history of modern Chinese culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southcn.com/edu/newbook/dushu/200702130372.htm ''The Revolution of Liumang’s Language'' (话语的革命)]. ''Southcn.com''. 13 February 2007. para 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the publication of this book in November 2006, some passages had been published in many newspapers, for example, [[Dongfang Daily]] ([[:zh:东方早报]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Festival of Liumang'' (流氓的盛宴), written by Zhu Dake (朱大可), New Star Press, November 2006, page 415, line 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Review of the 21st Century Chinese Culture'' (multi-volume)===
Review of the 21st Century Chinese Culture, issued under Zhu Dake and [[Zhang Hong (essayist)|Zhang Hong]]’s (张闳, [[culture critic]] and [[essayist]]) general editorship and published by [[Guangxi Normal University Press]] from 2003 to 2008, is an annual presentation of the cultural achievement of [[Mainland China]].&lt;ref&gt;''Review of the 21st Century Chinese Culture, volume 2008'' (21世纪中国文化地图, 2008年卷), edited by Zhu Dake (朱大可) and Zhang Hong (张闳), Tongji University Press, October 2001, cover page&lt;/ref&gt; There are 7 volumes up to now. It includes the essence of documents on [[cultural criticism]] of the year, popular key words and their explanations, lists of cultural events of the year and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723142217/http://daoli.getbbs.com/wap/mtc.aspx?tid=201068 ''About Review of the 21st Century Chinese Culture, wolume 2005'' (21世纪中国文化地图, 2005年卷简介)], written by Wu Jingyu (無竟寓), 21 December 2006, para 3, line 1&lt;/ref&gt; To highlight the spirit of humanist culture, the book was edited from with a unique stand and the spirit of criticism as the coordinate system of "culture map": "cultural events" as its meridians to show the important events of different cultural domains, "key words" as its parallels to penetratingly explain the key words in the public cultural space, plus "critical literary selections" to note the annual high mental standard of culture criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnstock.com/paper_new/html/2006-10/11/content_48923450.htm ''About Review of the 21st Century Chinese Culture, volume 2005'' (21世纪中国文化地图, 2005年卷简介)], 11 October 2006, para 1, line 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the graphic design, the book is always simple and plain, while every article in it is extremely exclusive and trenchant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.360doc.com/content/11/0301/10/3013819_97088026.shtml ''To Find the Lost Passion in Criticism'' (在批评中寻找遗失的激情)], written by Xi He (西河), from ''Wenhui Book Review'' (文汇读书报), August 2006, para 1, line 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the theses of cultural criticism that the editors selected, are fruits of folk language. They demonstrate the general popular state of narration through text and maintained the original creation of the language and different critics’ unique styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbtpress.com/asp/presssp.asp?id=45 ''To Left or to Right'' (向左走向右走)], written by Wang Jing (王静), 19 December 2003, para 5, line 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The two editors took a more popular stand and more inclined to free individuals. They strove to break through the style of traditional yearbooks to present a more open state with more perspectives and tightly trace the flowing deformation and the future trend of Chinese culture. It is a significant "memorandum book" to learn local practices and customs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinobook.com.cn/comment/newsdetail.cfm?iCntno=2410 ''Zhu Dake Raised the "National Customs" of New Century'' (朱大可掀起新世纪"国风")], written by Wang Yan (王焱), 14 January 2004, para 2, line 3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Şirin Hatun''' ({{lang-ota|شیریں خاتون}}; before 1450 – after 1500) was a consort of Sultan [[Bayezid II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Biography==
Little is known of Şirin’s early life. The Ottoman inscription (vakfiye) describes her as ''Hātun binti Abdullah'' (Daughter of Abdullah) which means that she was a harem concubine converted to Islam or her father was possibly a Christian who converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="ArchiveTurkey13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Turkey/turkey6.htm |title=Turkey: The Imperial House of Osman |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=6 February 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502150908/http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Turkey/turkey6.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enfal.de/otarih44.htm|title=Consorts Of Ottoman Sultans (in Turkish)|publisher = Ottoman Web Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Dolphin Alerson|title=The Structure of the Ottoman Dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/books?u75BAAAAYAAJ|year=1956|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayezid married her in 1464 at [[Amasya]].&lt;ref name="ArchiveTurkey13"/&gt; When Bayezid was still a şehzade ("Ottoman prince") and the governor of Amasya, she gave birth to Bayezid's first son, Şehzade Abdullah in 1465 and later to a daughter [[Aynışah Hatun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Necdet|last=Sakaoğlu|title=Bu mülkün kadın sultanları: Vâlide sultanlar, hâtunlar, hasekiler, kadınefendiler, sultanefendiler|publisher=Oğlak Yayıncılık|year=2008|pages=303|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Padışahların kadınları ve kızları|last=Uluçay |first= Mustafa Çağatay |publisher=Türk Tarihi Kurumu Yayınları |year=1985 |isbn= |series= |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1481, Abdullah was sent to Manisa (then known as [[Manisa Province|Saruhan]]) and in the same year to [[Karaman Province|Karaman]], and Şirin accompanied him.&lt;ref name="leslie"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie P. Peirce|title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L6-VRgVzRcUC|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=106–107|isbn=978-0-195-08677-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leslie"/&gt;

After the death of Şehzade Abdullah at his provincial post, Şirin came to [[Bursa]] in 1483.&lt;ref name="leslie"/&gt; In retirement she occupied herself with pious works.&lt;ref name="leslie"/&gt; She built a "Hatuniye Mosque" located inside [[Trabzon Castle]] and endowed a religious college in [[Trabzon]], and then she also built a tomb for Abdullah, in which she was too buried at her death.&lt;ref name="leslie"/&gt;
