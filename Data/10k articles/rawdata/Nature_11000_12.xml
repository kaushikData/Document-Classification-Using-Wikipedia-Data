      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1060">'''Acousto-electric effect''' is a [[nonlinear]] phenomenon of generation of [[electric current]] in a [[piezo-electric]] [[semiconductor]] by a propagating acoustic wave. The generated electric current is proportional to the [[Sound intensity|intensity]] of the acoustic wave and to the value of its electron-induced [[attenuation]]. The effect was theoretically predicted in 1953 by Parmenter. Its first experimental observation was reported in 1957 by Weinreich and White.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Beetles-1.jpg|right|thumb]] --&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Beetlles-2.jpg|right|thumb]] --&gt;'''''American Beetles''''' is the single most comprehensive{{Fact|date=September 2008}} description of the [[beetle]]s of [[North America]] north of the tropical area of [[Mexico]]. It was started by [[Ross H. Arnett, Jr.]] as an update of his classic ''The Beetles of the United States''; along with [[Michael C. Thomas]], he enlisted more than 60 specialists to write treatments of each family. The work outlived Arnett, and was published by [[CRC Press]] in 2001 (vol. 1) and 2002 (vol. 2).

This is a highly technical book, with extensive references to the literature.
The introduction includes a section on [[beetle anatomy]] that introduces all the technical terms used later. The bulk of the content consists of treatments of the 130-odd families known to occur in North America (a couple dozen are not known from North America, and are not described); the descriptive material applies worldwide, and there are brief notes about non-North American family members.

A family treatment consists of a morphological description, including the larvae if known, habits and habitats, status of the classification, a key to the [[Nearctic]] [[genus|genera]] (and sometimes species, if the family is small), and short treatments of the subtaxa. Every family gets at least one drawing of a member, and larger families may include dozens of drawings illustrating particular characters important for classification. Note that the classification that appears in Volume 1, pp. 10-13, is superseded by a number of changes that appeared in Volume 2 (the relegation of the families [[Monommatidae]], [[Colydiidae]], and [[Bruchidae]] to subfamily status, and the revised spelling of [[Ripiphoridae]]), and these changes have been incorporated into the [[List of subgroups of the order Coleoptera]].

A handful of color photographs are included in a center section.

'''Anholt''' ({{IPA-da|ˈanhɔːˀld}}) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] island in the [[Kattegat]], midway between [[Jutland]] and Sweden at the entrance to the North Sea in Northern Europe. There are 145 permanent residents as of 1 January 2016.&lt;ref name="statistikbanken"&gt;[http://statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1024 "Danmarks Statistik."] Retrieved 23 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Anholt is seven miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) long and about four miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) wide at its widest, and covers an area of {{cvt|21.75|km2|sqmi}}. Anholt is part of [[Norddjurs Municipality]] in [[Region Midtjylland]]. Before the 2007 [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform of 2007|municipal reform]], it was in [[Grenå Municipality]].
[[File:Anholt, Ørkenen.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Anholt, Ørkenen - Desert - with sparse vegetation, covers 80 percent of the island.]]

The western fifth of Anholt consists of hilly moraine country, while the eastern four-fifths of the island consist of mostly flat raised seabed with some low hills, former wind-blown sand dunes. Only the western moraine hills are inhabited. The eastern part, called "Ørkenen" - the Desert - is treeless; the government has protected the area and permits no building there. The desert has never been ploughed. For this reason the original stone age topography from when the glaciation ceased, at the end of the last ice age 10,000 years ago, is still visible in many places. This includes former shorelines inland, consequences of different sea levels over time. The unploughed features of The Desert are unique for Denmark, as well as for this part of Europe.

The inhabited part of Anholt has two villages, The Harbour and Anholt Town, inland. There are also 300 to 400 summer houses, some of them rentals.{{clear left}}

[[File:Anholt desert.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The Anholt "desert", more precisely a [[heath]]]]

== {{anchor|Desert}} Terrain==
The western part of Anholt is a [[moraine]] landscape. The small village is situated in the middle of the landscape, whereas the harbour (built 1902) is at the northwestern tip of the island. The eastern part of the island is known as {{strong|Ørkenen}} ("desert"). This desert-like area is the largest of its kind in Northern Europe. The [[desertification]] was caused by [[deforestation]]. Strictly speaking, the "desert" is not a true [[desert]], but a [[lichen]] [[heath]], with some 300 to 400 types of lichen.

Great efforts are being taken to preserve the unique scenery and prevent the devastating effects of [[erosion]]. In 1995/6 the Danish Heath Society cleared large areas in the south part of Ørkenen of [[mountain pine]].

On Totten, the eastern tip of the island, there is one of the biggest colonies of [[pinniped|seal]]s in Denmark. This part of the island is closed to visitors.

===Lighthouse===
[[File:Bascule-ight-Skagen.jpg|left\150px|thumb|Bascule light at [[Skagen]]]]

Dangerous reefs and shoals surround Anholt. Consequently, in 1560 King [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]] ordered the erection of [[Vippefyr|bascule lights]] at [[Skagen]], Anholt, and [[Kullen Lighthouse]] to mark the main route through Danish waters from the North Sea to the Baltic.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn-Pedersen, Morten (2003), 81-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the bascule light, on 10 November 1716 the 60-gun [[third-rate]] [[HMS Auguste (1705)|HMS ''Auguste'']], Captain Robert Johnson, ran ashore on the island of Anholt during heavy weather and was wrecked.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper (1994), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the people on her were saved. An ecological consequence of the introduction of the bascule light was the [[deforestation]] of Anholt for firewood, resulting in [[#Desert|Anholt's "desert"]].  By the time of the switch after 1600 to imported pit coal, considerable damage had been done.&lt;ref&gt;Kjærgaard (1994), pp. 13–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785 a 35-meter tower was erected with an open fire. In 1805 a lantern replaced the fire and in 1838 a mirror was added.

Then in early 1842 an intermittent (flashing) light replaced the fixed light, and a lightship was towed to a station of the Knobben, off Anholt. Around the mid-19th century there was also a floating light stationed several miles out from the lighthouse, near the end of the several miles long reef. This floating light operated from May to December.

Today's tower dates to 1881, at which time an [[oil lamp]] replaced the fire. At one time there was also a beacon fire in the middle of the east coast of the island, but that has disappeared. The present Anholt Fyr (lighthouse) belongs to the [[Danish Maritime Safety Administration]] and has the status of a protected historical landmark.

Anholt has been settled since the [[New Stone Age]] and one may still find [[flint]] flakes on the “desert”. There have been some [[Old Stone Age]] finds as well. The island has never been the object of systematic archaeological investigation, so no [[Bronze Age]] remnants have been found. Some [[Viking]] finds have been made.

The 1231 [[land register]] of King [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] shows that the king owned a house or a hunting lodge on the Sønderbjerg, the island's highest point. Anholt was thus property of the crown. In 1441 the island was under the administration of Kalø Lehn, headed by Otto Nielsen Rosenkrands.

Anholt belonged to the parish of [[Morup]] in the Danish province of [[Halland]] until the middle of the 16th century, when a church was built on the island itself.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Store Danske Encyklopædi]]'', CD-ROM edition, entry ''Anholt'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The island remained Danish when Denmark ceded Halland to Sweden in 1645. A story claims that a negotiator had left a glass of beer placed over the island on the map during the peace negotiations. A more plausible explanation is that Swedish forces had not conquered the fairly remote island and had little interest in it.

In 1668 Anholt was sold to the [[tax farming|tax farmer]] Peder Jensen Grove. Six years later his widow married Hans Rostgaard of Krogerup and the island then came  at the hands of the [[Maase (noble family)|Rostgaard von der Maase family]]. Most recently, the lawyer Jens Christian Rostgaard von der Maase, of Copenhagen, has owned the greater and protected part of the island.

On 11 November 1716 {{HMS|Auguste|1705}}, a British naval [[fourth rate]], wrecked on the island of [[Anholt (Denmark)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=11 December 1716|issue=5494|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hepper (1994), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British occupation (1809–1814)===
Early in the [[Gunboat War]] (part of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]), the Danes closed the lighthouse on Anholt. On 5 December 1808 the bomb vessel [[HMS Proselyte (1804)|HMS ''Proselyte'']] was wrecked on Anholt Reef while caught in the ice; all her crew was saved. She had stationed herself off the island on 9 November 1808 to carry a light for the safety of passing convoys.

Following the loss of ''Proselyte'', on 18 May 1809 the 64-gun [[third rate]] [[HMS Standard (1782)|HMS ''Standard'']], under Captain [[Aiskew Hollis|Askew Paffard Hollis]], and the 18-pounder 36-gun frigate [[HMS Owen Glendower (1808)|''Owen Glendower'']] captured the island. A party of seamen and marines under the command of Captain William Selby of ''Owen Glendower'', with the assistance of Captain [[Edward Nicolls]] of the ''Standard''{{'}}s marines, landed. The Danish garrison of 170 men put up a sharp but ineffectual resistance that killed one British marine and wounded two; the garrison then surrendered. The British took immediate possession of the island. The principal objective of the mission was to restore the lighthouse on the island to its pre-war state to facilitate the movement of British men of war and merchantmen navigating the dangerous seas there.&lt;ref&gt;James (1827), 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danes attempted to retake the island. However, the [[Battle of Anholt]] (27 March 1811) resulted in many Danish casualties and proved a decisive British victory. There is a monument commemorating the battle in Anholt village.

While captain of [[HMS Elephant (1786)|HMS ''Elephant'']], [[Francis Austen]] visited Anholt in 1812 and wrote about it to his sister, the famed novelist [[Jane Austen]]. He described the lighthouse in some detail and also gave some impressions of the island:

{{blockquote|The garrison at present consists of about three men of a veteran battalion, and a few marine artillery, which form by many degrees the most considerable portion of the population, for, exclusive of the military and their appendages of wives and children, there are but sixteen families on the island, who all reside at the only village on it, near the high ground to the westward, and whose principal occupation is fishing, in which they are generally very successful during the summer.

Antecedent to the war between England and Denmark and the consequent occupation of the island by the English, the Anholters paid a small rent to the proprietor of the soil, who is a Danish nobleman residing at Copenhagen; but at present they are considered and fed as prisoners of war by the English. They are an exceedingly poor people, and seem to enjoy but a small proportion of worldly comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Huback and Huback (1906), 289.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 28 February 1812, the 16-gun [[brig]] [[HMS Fly (1805)|HMS ''Fly'']] was wrecked on Anholt, but without loss of life. Then on 19 August 1812, Dano-Norwegian gunboats captured {{HMS|Attack|1804|6}} off the island after an engagement. The [[United Kingdom|British]] held Anholt until the [[Treaty of Kiel]] ended the war on 15 January 1814.

In the 1940s a British visitor heard children reciting a verse which they did not understand the meaning of "{{lang|da|Jeck og Jill vent op de hill, og Jill kom tombling after}}". 
The ditty, it turned out, had been [[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|a nursery rhyme]] brought to the island by British soldiers during the Napoleonic wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fadiman|first=Clifton|authorlink=Clifton Fadiman|title=Party of One|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ii8yAAAAIAAJ|year=1955|publisher=World Pub.|page=397|quote=During the Napoleonic wars the British briefly occupied the Danish island of Anholt. Of that occupation no trace remains today, save one: diminutive, non-melancholy Danes sing what is to them a nonsense rhyme: ''{{lang|da|Jeck og Jill Vent op de hill...}}''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
Denmark was neutral during the war and neither side disturbed the Kattegat until late in the war when the British laid a minefield. During the operation the British sank 10 trawlers off Anholt.

===World War II===
There were several World War II sinkings off Anholt.
*On 11 April 1940, the British submarine [[HMS Sealion (72S)|''Sealion'']] torpedoed and sank the German steamer {{SS|August Leonhardt|1922|2}} (2,593grt) thirteen miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) south of Anholt Island at {{coord|56|30|N|11|30|E}}. ''Sealion'' fired two torpedoes, one of which found its mark.
*On 1 May 1940, the British submarine [[HMS Narwhal (N45)|''Narwhal'']], (Lt.Cdr. R.J. Burch, RN) torpedoed and sank the German troop transport {{SS|Buenos Aires|1911|2}} (6,097 GRT) and torpedoed and damaged the German troop transport {{SS|Bahia Castillo|1917|2}} (8,580 GRT) in the Kattegat about {{convert|20|nmi|km}} north of Anholt, Denmark in position {{coord|57|05|N|11|35|E}}. ''Bahia Castillo'' reached port but was declared a total loss.
*On 20 May 1940, the troop transport SS ''Batavier III'', owned by Wm.H. van Müller &amp; Co., hit a mine and sank northwest of Anholt.
*On 21 April 1945, British bombers sank the ''Ostmark'' (ex-''Cote d'Argent'', launched 1932 and 3,047 GRT).
*On 5 May 1945, a [[Royal Air Force]] bomber sank the [[German submarine U-534|German submarine ''U-534'']]. The submarine was on the surface with three other submarines when the attack occurred. The Germans shot down one of the British bombers, whose crew all were lost. All of the crew of ''U-534'' escaped the submarine, but three died of exposure or lung damage in surfacing; lifeboats from a lightship in the vicinity rescued the 49 survivors.  On 25 August 1993, the ''U-534'' was pulled 220 feet (67 m) to the surface of the Kattegat Sea, 13 miles (20&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of Anholt Island. After being housed at a museum that later closed, the submarine was moved to the [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside Ferry Terminal]] in [[Liverpool]] for an exhibition on U-Boats that opened in February 2009.
*On 19 April 1945, rockets from eight British and Norwegian [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito aircraft]] sank the German submarine ''[[German submarine U-251|U-251]]'' south of Anholt ({{coord|56.37|N|11.51|E}}). Thirty-nine of her crew died; four survived.

There is a small graveyard on Anholt that holds the remains of five allied airmen. Three are from an [[Avro Lancaster]] of 438 Squadron that crashed into the Baltic around 29–30 August 1944. On 15 December a [[Ju 88]] night fighter shot down an [[Avro Lancaster]] of [[No. 106 Squadron RAF|106 Squadron]], which had a crew of eight. Only three bodies washed ashore, one of them on Anholt; the others were never recovered.

[[File:Anholt Havvindmøllepark.jpg|thumb|250px|The Anholt Ferry in Grenaa Harbor.]]
A daily [[ferry]] from [[Grenå]] on the eastern coast of Jutland takes about three hours to reach Anholt. The ferry detours around the wind farm, which will compensate for the increased fuel consumption in order to maintain sailing schedules.&lt;ref name=wf1&gt;[http://www.anholt.dk/havmollepark.htm Anholt Havmøllepark] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203102359/http://www.anholt.dk/havmollepark.htm |date=February 3, 2012 }} ''Anholt.dk''. Accessed: 10 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anholt has an airport {{Airport codes||{{nobold|EKAT}}}} with a {{convert|650|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} grass runway. There are daily flights to Anholt during the summer and weekly flights in the winter.

Flights depart from [[Roskilde Airport]] on the Danish main island, Sealand, via [[Copenhagen Air Taxi]]. The flights also go on to [[Læsø]] Island, and return to Roskilde from there, via Anholt.

One can also fly from [[Varberg]], Sweden, via [[charter flights|charter]] from Varbergs Flygklubb, a [[flying club]].

===Port===

[[File:Anholt port.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Anholt port]]

After some years of political debate, in 1899 construction commenced on a fishing harbour for the island. The construction was finished and the port entered service in 1902. The harbour functioned as a safe haven in storms for the vessels fishing in the Kattegat, as well as a [[home port]] for Anholt's own fishermen. Today there is a [[marina]] at the harbour and the ferry docks here too. In 2003 Anholt celebrated the 100th anniversary of the opening, but one year late.

The first rescue facility on the island was established in 1878 at the lighthouse. It was abandoned in 1926. The second rescue facility was built in 1919, but abandoned in 1938. Today there is a rescue vessel stationed at a mole in the harbour. Over the last 200 years over 200 vessels have [[foundered]] near Anholt.

==Tourism==

Some 60,000 people visit Anholt each year. From the end of June to the first half of August the harbor is a tourist resort with restaurants, tourist shops, and an always full marina next to a sandy beach. Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and German yachts are among the most common sailing boats seen at Anholt. 
[[File:Anholt Nordstrand.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Anholt Nordstrand - the sandy, {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}}, northern beach with characteristic coastal dunes in the background.]]

Anholt has no luxury hotels or resorts. There are some Bed and Breakfast facilities and a campground. The Tourist Office, located at the harbor office, can help with information about accommodation.

Anholt's main attraction is nature in the form of clean water, with an abundance of often empty sandy beaches, plus calm, beauty, and fresh air. From the two highest points on the island – Sønderbjerg (48 m) and Nordbjerg (39 m) – one can see Jutland or Sweden on a clear day.

Outside the summer season, there are few visitors to Anholt. Currently an effort is made to extend the tourist season via events such as an Anholt Marathon and festivals.

==Offshore wind farm==

[[File:Anholtfærgen i Grenå Havn.jpg|thumb|250px|Anholt Wind Farm - 110, 4.5 MW, Turbines. The ferry passes close by.]]
{{main article|Anholt Offshore Wind Farm}}
[[DONG Energy]] has built the [[Anholt Offshore Wind Farm]] in the Kattegat, between Anholt island and [[Djursland]] (on the mainland). It consists of 111 wind turbines and has a nameplate capacity of 400 megawatts (MW).

{{As of|2014}} it is Denmark's largest marine wind park, and among the five largest marine wind parks in the world. It provides energy to the island to replace much of the current diesel-powered electricity. The main part of the electricity is distributed to the mainland via a sea cable to Jutland, entering land by the town, Grenå.

Fishermen have been compensated for the loss of fisheries during construction. With the wind farm complete, net fishing is allowed, but trawling is banned inside the park-area.&lt;ref name=wf1/&gt;

==School==
The school, north of the meeting house, was built in 1917 and enlarged in 1956. It teaches students from kindergarten to year 9.

The present church was built in 1819, after the previous one was destroyed during [[#British occupation|British occupation]] of the island in the early 1810s. There is evidence in the foundations of an even older church. Anholt has a tradition for building houses that include materials from [[Flotsam and jetsam|flotsam]].

In [[geology]], '''aquatic succession''' is the process in which a glacial lake dries up. Over the lifespan of a [[glacier]] it dissolves into a body of water. Aquatic succession is the continuing step of that solid water-turned-lake melting into the ground and further disappearing into [[nothingness|oblivion]]. The lakes sometime become underground lakes or rivers. The water tends to remain part of the local [[hydrosphere]] by percolating into [[aquifers]].

The '''Blue Flag''' ({{Lang-ga|links=no|Brat Ghorm}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/kerryman/localnotes/brat-ghorm-don-bal-bn-27413075.html|title=Brat ghorm don Béal Bán|language=Irish   |work=independent.ie|accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eures/advertiseJob.jsp?acro=emp&amp;lang=ga&amp;catId=7564&amp;countryId=IS|title=EUROPA - EURES - Page Title|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a certification by the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] (FEE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bysted A/S |url=http://www.fee-international.org/ |title=FEE - Foundation for Environmental Education |publisher=Fee-international.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a [[beach]], [[marina]], or sustainable boating tourism operator meets its stringent standards.

The Blue Flag is a [[trademark]] owned by FEE which is a not-for-profit [[non-governmental organisation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueflag.org |title=Blue Flag Programme |publisher=Blueflag.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of 65 organisations in 60 member countries.

FEE's Blue Flag criteria include standards for   quality, safety, environmental education and information, the provision of services and general [[environmental management]] criteria. The Blue Flag is sought for beaches, marinas, and sustainable boating tourism operators as an indication of their high environmental and quality standards.

Certificates, which FEE refers to as awards, are issued on an annual basis to beaches and marinas of FEE member countries. The awards are announced yearly on 5 June for Europe, Canada, Morocco, Tunisia, and other countries in a similar geographic location, and on 1 November for the Caribbean, New Zealand, South Africa, and other countries in the [[southern hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueflag.org/Menu/Blue+Flag+beaches%2fmarinas Blue Flag beaches/marinas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911195743/http://www.blueflag.org/Menu/Blue+Flag+beaches%2fmarinas# |date=11 September 2013 }}. Retrieved 11 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the water quality standards are incorporated in the EC [[Water Framework Directive]].

Spain has held the 1st position for nearly three decades since the awards began in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.es/20160506/spain-once-again-smashes-records-on-best-beaches-worldwide-to-do-islands|title=It's official: Spain has the best beaches in the whole world|date=6 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: [[List of Blue Flag Beaches of Wales|Wales]], Scotland, England and Northern Ireland have always been treated as individual countries e.g. in 2015 Northern Ireland had 10 Blue Flag beaches and marinas, England had 61, Wales had 41 and Scotland 1.&lt;ref group="Blue Flag Website" name="Blue Flag Website-global"&gt;{{cite web|title = Blue Flag Website|url = http://www.blueflag.global|publisher = The Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE)|accessdate = 29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Blue Flag was created in France in 1985 as a pilot scheme where French coastal municipalities were awarded the Blue Flag on the basis of criteria covering sewage treatment and bathing water quality.

===Blue Flag on European Community level in 1987===
1987 was the "European Year of the Environment" and the European Commission was responsible for developing the European Community activities of that year. The Foundation for Environmental Education in Europe (FEEE) presented the concept of the Blue Flag to the Commission, and it was agreed to launch the Blue Flag Programme as one of several "European Year of the Environment" activities in the Community.

The French concept of the Blue Flag was developed on European level to include other areas of environmental management, such as waste management and coastal planning and protection. Besides beaches marinas also became eligible for the Blue Flag.

In 1987, 244 beaches and 208 marinas from 10 countries were awarded the Blue Flag.

===Success===
There have been increases in the numbers of Blue Flags awarded each year. The criteria have during these years been changed to more strict criteria. As an example, in 1992 the Programme started using the restrictive guideline values in the EEC Bathing Water Directive as imperative criteria, and this was also the year where all Blue Flag criteria became the same in all participating countries.

===Outside the European Union===
In 2001, FEEE rules were changed to allow non-European national organisations, sharing the objectives of FEEE, to become members, and changed its name by dropping Europe from its name, becoming the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE).

Several organisations and authorities outside the European Union have joined FEE. FEE has been cooperating with UNEP and UN WTO on extending the Programme to areas outside Europe. South Africa, Canada, Morocco, Tunisia, New Zealand and four countries in the Caribbean region are members of FEE. Aruba and Brazil are currently in the pilot phase of the Programme and  Jordan, Macedonia, Turks &amp; Caicos Islands, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates have started the implementation of the Blue Flag Programme.

FEE standards allow for regional variations in beach criteria to reflect specific environmental conditions of a region. As of 2006 an international set of criteria is being used with some variations.

=== Extension of the award to sustainable boating tourism operators ===
In 2016, Blue Flag extended its programme boat-based tourism activities like nature watching (whale watching, bird watching, cage diving etc.), recreational fishing, diving and crewed charter tours. Certified tour operators have to comply with criteria regarding the sustainable operation of their boats and their business as a whole.

===Present program===
In 2015 over 4,154 beaches and marinas globally were awarded the Blue Flag.&lt;ref name="Blue Flag Website" group="Blue Flag Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Flag International Website|url=http://www.blueflag.org/|publisher=The Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE)|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

47 countries are currently participating in the Blue Flag Programme: [[Bahamas]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[England]], [[Estonia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Jordan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Malta]], [[Mexico]], [[Montenegro]], [[Morocco]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Sint Maarten|Sint Marteen]], [[Scotland]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Tunisia]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Turkey]],  [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Ukraine]], [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]] and [[Wales]].

When the [[sky]] is clear, the blue hour can be a colorful spectacle, with the [[diffuse sky radiation|indirect sunlight]] tinting the sky yellow, orange, [[Belt of Venus|red]], and [[Earth's shadow|blue]]. This effect is caused by the relative [[photon diffusion|diffusibility]] of shorter [[wavelengths]] (bluer rays) of [[visible light]] versus the longer wavelengths (redder rays).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} During the blue "hour", which typically lasts roughly 20 minutes (depending on [[latitude]]), red light passes through space while blue light is [[scattering|scattered]] in the atmosphere, and thus reaches Earth's surface.

Many artists value this period for the quality of the [[hard and soft light|soft light]]. Although the blue hour does not have an official definition, the blue color spectrum is most prominent when the Sun is between 4° and 8° below the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blue Hour – Magic Hour |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/blue-hour.html |publisher=timeanddate.com |access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cadwalader Ringgold''' (August 20, 1802 – April 29, 1867) was an officer in the [[United States Navy]] who served in the [[United States Exploring Expedition]], later headed an expedition to the Northwest and, after initially retiring, returned to service during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

==Life and early career==
Cadwalader Ringgold was born August 20, 1802, in [[Washington County, Maryland]], at Fountain Rock, the {{convert|18000|acre|ha|sing=on}} family estate.
His mother was  Maria Cadwalader (1776–1811), daughter of [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]] (1742–1786), who was a general during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Some sources spell his first name with two "l"s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DANFS |title= Ringgold (DD-89) |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/r6/ringgold-i.htm |accessdate= March 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His father was [[Samuel Ringgold (congressman)|Samuel Ringgold]], a Maryland politician who later served in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
He had an older brother, [[Samuel Ringgold (US Army officer)|Samuel Ringgold]], an army officer called "the father of modern artillery" and who died in the [[Battle of Palo Alto]]. Cadwalader was the sixth of 11 children, the youngest child of his mother, who then died. His father remarried and had five more children by his second wife.

Ringgold entered the U.S. Navy in 1819 and commanded the [[schooner]] {{USS|Weazel|1822|2}} in action against [[West Indies]] [[pirates]] during the late 1820s. He became a lieutenant on May 17, 1828,&lt;ref name=usnlibrary&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/books/callahan/reg-usn-r.htm Naval Historical Center Web site] (operated by the U.S. Navy)
"Officers of the Continental and U.S. Navy and marine Corps, 1775-1900/ US Navy Officers: 1798-1900—"R", accessed October 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and that year served on {{USS|Vandalia|1828|2}} in the Pacific Ocean. He served on the {{USS|Adams|1799|2}} in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].

==United States Exploring Expedition==
During 1838–42, he was third in command of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] in the Pacific, commanding {{USS|Porpoise|1836|2}} from 1840 at the invitation of the head of the project, [[Charles Wilkes]].&lt;ref name=Quanchi&gt;{{cite book | last = Quanchi | first = Max|authorlink=| year = 2005 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands | publisher = The Scarecrow Press  | location =  | page=215| isbn = 0810853957}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carried out surveys of [[Antarctica]], the South American coast, the [[Tuamotu Islands]], [[Tonga]], [[New Zealand]] and the Northwest Pacific coast of North America.&lt;ref name=Quanchi/&gt;

When the expedition visited [[Fiji]], they captured [[Vendoni]], a chief on the islands who had inspired some Fijians to capture and eat 11 crewmen on a ship seven years before.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, Alan Fraser, "Cadwalader Ringgold, U. S. Navy" an article in ''California History'' magazine, Volume 79, Issue 4, Winter 2000, page 208. Fraser, in Footnote 15, cites The ''Boston Evening Transcript'', February 26, 1842, page 2, and Wilkes, Charles, ''Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition: durings 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, 1842, volume III'', (Philadelphia: C. Sherman, 1844), 109-111, and Stanton, William, ''The Great United States Exploring Expedition of 1838-1842'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975), page 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, Fijians on the island of Malolo ambushed and killed two popular officers of the expedition, and the Americans took revenge.  Wilkes' ship grounded on the north side of the island, but Ringgold led 80 men  from the south side. Women and children were spared, but about 87 Fijians were killed before the rest surrendered. Two villages were destroyed.&lt;ref name=fraser&gt;Houston, Alan Fraser, "Cadwalader Ringgold, U. S. Navy" an article in ''California History'' magazine, Volume 79, Issue 4, Winter 2000, page 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition visited California that summer. On August 19, 1841, Ringgold led a 60-man party exploring [[San Francisco Bay]] watershed for 20 days. The party got about as far as [[Colusa, California]]. Ringgold, who returned to New York shortly after the rest of the expedition, had been gone three years and 11 months at sea. He and his crew had sailed {{convert|95000|mi|km}} and lost only two men.&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;

==Other expeditions==
Ringgold was promoted to commander on July 16, 1849 and  began the definitive survey of the San Francisco Bay region, suddenly important because of the [[California Gold Rush|discovery of gold]] in the area. The survey began in August 1849, with Ringgold commanding the chartered brig ''Col. Fremont''.&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;

After the California surveys, Ringgold helped Navy officials choose a location for a dockyard for the Navy's Pacific station. It later became the [[Mare Island Navy Yard]]. He published ''A Series of Charts with Sailing Directions'' in 1851.&lt;ref name=Quanchi/&gt;Together with Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] and others, Ringgold served in August 1852 on the Board of Examination for midshipmen of the [[U.S. Naval Academy]] at Annapolis.&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;

It may have been around this time that Ringgold acquired a [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] politician [[Henry Clay]], presumably out of admiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/clay.htm Lib.edul.edu], Mentioned in an engraving that is part of a collection at the University of Delaware. Web page titled "Henry Clay Presentation Items" describing "Henry Clay presentation items" in the library's Special Collections Department. Description reads: "Engraving of a bust of Henry Clay.  Inscription reads: 'Engraved by W.H. Dougal, by permission for the Use of Congress, from a Bust by H.K. Brown of N.Y. in the possession of Cadwalader Ringgold, U.S.N. Daguerreotype by Whitchurst. Washington, D.C. 1852.' ”, Web page accessed October 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853 he took command of the five ships in the [[North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition]], also known as the "Rodgers-Ringgold Expedition", with the {{USS|Vincennes|1826|2}} as his flagship, but while on the expedition, in July 1854, he contracted [[malaria]] and was sent home, according to at least one source.&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt; 
[[Nathaniel Philbrick]], in his book ''Sea of Glory'' about the U.S. Exploring Expedition, writes that in the later expedition Ringgold "began to act strangely" once in China, keeping his ships in port "ceaselessly repairing his vessels". Commodore Perry, on his own expedition, sailed in and convened an official panel which relieved Ringgold from command of the expedition and sent him home. Philbrick quotes Perry as declaring Ringgold "insane."&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, Nathaniel, ''Sea of Glory: America's voyage of discovery, The U.S. Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842'' (Viking: 2003), {{ISBN|0-670-03231-X}} pages 351,-352&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rodgers (naval officer, Civil War)|John Rodgers]] was given full command of the expedition and completed it.

A board of naval doctors convened by Perry declared Ringgold unfit for active service, and he was put on the reserve list on September 13, 1855. Ringgold recovered within weeks, and soon petitioned Congress for his return. Unsuccessful there, he appealed to a Court of Inquiry, and eventually succeeded in returning to the active list on January 23, 1858, (retroactive to April 2, 1856), a campaign of more than two years.&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;

For the next several years, he was in Washington, D.C., working on the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition charts, some of which were used by the US Navy in WWII (charts from the United States Exploring Expedition were also used in that war).&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;

==Civil War and after==
Ringgold returned to the fleet with the rank of captain during the Civil War. While in command of the frigate {{USS|Sabine|1855|2}} on November 1, 1861, he effected the rescue of a battalion of 400 [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] from Maryland whose transport steamer, ''Governor'', was sinking during a severe storm near [[Port Royal, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;

In February 1862, he was a part of the search and rescue of the ship of the line {{USS|Vermont|1848|2}} which had lost her rudder in a storm. For these rescues, Ringgold received commendations from the Maryland Legislature and the U.S. Congress, along with a gold medal from the Life Saving Benevolent Association.&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;

Promoted to [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]] on July 16, 1862, he was sent (still on the ''Sabine''), to cruise the [[Azores]], [[Cape Verde Islands]], the coast of [[Brazil]] and then back to New York in a fruitless search for the Confederate raider {{Ship|CSS|Alabama}} from November 1862 to February 1863. In mid-1863, Ringgold's assignment was to search (again unsuccessfully) in the vicinity of Bermuda and then the New England coast for the bark {{Ship|CSS|Tacony}}, another Confederate raider.&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;

For reasons of age, he was retired on August 20, 1864, and placed on the [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] (retired) list in 1866 (a promotion that was given to all commanders of squadrons). In retirement, he lived at 18 East Eighteenth Street (at Union Square) in New York City. Ringgold, who had never married, died of [[apoplexy]] (stroke) in New York on April 29, 1867.&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;

Days later, as the Marine band played the "Dead March" from ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'', 400 Marines and carriages in the funeral cortege proceeded from Ringgold's residence down Broadway to [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]]. In attendance were Admirals [[David Farragut|Farragut]], [[Henry H. Bell|Bell]], and [[Silas Stringham|Stringham]], along with a number of generals. Ringgold's remains were taken by train to [[Green Mount Cemetery]] in Baltimore, where he lies next to the grave of his brother, Major [[Samuel Ringgold (soldier)|Samuel Ringgold]].&lt;ref name=fraser/&gt;

==Namesakes==
Two ships have been named in his honor: {{USS|Ringgold|DD-89}} and {{USS|Ringgold|DD-500}}.

Ringgold Street in San Francisco, California is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfmuseum.org/street/stnames5.html Sfmuseum.org], "San Francisco Streets Named for Pioneers"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another namesake was the writer [[Ring Lardner]]. Rear Admiral [[James Lawrence Lardner]] was a friend of Ringgold's. He named a son "Ringgold Wilmer Lardner", and James' brother gave exactly the same name to his son after the newborn's cousin. Ring Lardner disliked his name and shortened it but "lost the battle" when his son, [[Ring Lardner Jr.]] was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tridget.com/family1.htm Tridget.com], The Lardners - Part One:  From England to Michigan.

'''Charles William Barkley''' (1759 – 16 May 1832) was a ship captain and [[maritime fur trade]]r. He was born in [[Hertford]], England, son of Charles Barkley.&lt;ref name=cabio&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=2747 Barkley, Charles William], Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online&lt;/ref&gt;

His name is sometimes erroneously spelled Barclay due to the misspelling "Barclay Sound" (in what is now [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]]) on early Admiralty charts, which arose from a mistake from Land District records. The misspelling originated in 1859 with the government agent William Eddy Banfield who issued certificates identifying the "Barclay Land District." The name was corrected to [[Barkley Sound]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{BCGNIS|11126|Barkley Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Banfield's own name was misspelled in the name of the town of [[Bamfield]], also on Vancouver Island.)

==Biography==

===Early life===
At the age of 11, Charles Barkley went to sea with his father, who was the commander of the [[East India Company]] ship ''Pacific''. His father drowned in the Hooghly river, Calcutta, India while Charles was still a boy. Charles went on to sail to the West Indies in the merchantman ''Bestsy''. He made seven voyages to the Far East for the East India Company and rose rapidly in the company's service.&lt;ref name=cabio/&gt;

He was married in 1786, he soon after left the East India Company, taking what was apparently his first command, the 400-ton ship ''Loundon'', ready for a trading voyage to the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast of North America. The ship, which was renamed ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]'' and falsely registered as an [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] in an attempt to avoid the cost of acquiring a trading license from the East India Company, was owned by various [[supercargo]]es, including several East India Company directors in England, who together called themselves the Austrian East India Company. Daniel Beale organised the voyage of the ''Imperial Eagle'' when he returned to London from Canton on the HCS ''General Coote'' in August 1786.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Dermigny, ''La Chine et L'Occident,'' Paris, SEVPEN, 1964, tome III, p.1241.&lt;/ref&gt; Beale had been the purser of, successively, the HC ships ''Walpole'' and ''General Coote'' on voyages between London and Canton in 1783–1786: in 1783 he joined the Canton partnership of [[John Henry Cox]] and John Reid in their mercantile ventures.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. King, "John Meares: Dubliner, Naval Officer, Fur Trader and would be Colonizer", ''Journal of Australian Naval History,'' vol.8, no.1, March 2011, pp.32–62, n.34.[http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=056205283519741;res=IELHSS King, "Meares"]&lt;/ref&gt; Beale's brother or cousin, John Beale, sailed in the ''Imperial Eagle'' as purser, but was killed in an affray with the natives on the North West Coast. Barkley was among the backers, subscribing £3,000 to the venture.&lt;ref name=cabio/&gt; [[John Meares]], who was also attempting to avoid license fees by falsely sailing under the Portuguese flag, was also one of the backers.&lt;ref name=frances&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101025183315/http://abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=3313 BARKLEY, Frances], ABCBookWorld&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchant career===
[[File:Winee, Naturelle d'Owhyhee l'une des Iles Sandwich.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Wynee]], a Native of Owyhee, one of the Sandwich Islands'', engraving by [[John Meares]] depicting the Hawaiian maidservant of the Barkley's.]]
Barkley and his wife, [[Frances Barkley]], left for the Pacific via [[Cape Horn]] on 24 November 1786. They stopped in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] where a maidservant named [[Wynee]] (Winée) was taken aboard. Wynee became the first [[Native Hawaiian]], or "Kanaka", to reach [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=frances/&gt; From Hawaii Barkley sailed the ''Imperial Eagle'' to [[Nootka Sound]], on the west coast of [[Vancouver Island]], arriving in June 1787. At 400 tons, the ''Imperial Eagle'' was the largest ship to ever enter the main harbour of Friendly Cove in Nootka Sound.&lt;ref name=frances/&gt; Barkley stayed at Nootka Sound for about a month, acquired 700 prime skins, and many more of inferior quality. From Nootka he sailed south, trading, exploring, and naming various parts of the coast between Nootka Sound and the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], including [[Barkley Sound]], Loudoun Channel, Cape Beale,&lt;ref&gt;{{BCGNIS|12543|Beale, Cape}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Imperial Eagle Channel. In honour of the indigenous chief [[Wickaninnish]] Barkley gave the name Wickinninish Sound to what is now called [[Clayoquot Sound]]. He rediscovered the strait allegedly described by [[Juan de Fuca]] and named the strait as such on his chart. Barkley's ''Imperial Eagle'' was the first non-indigenous vessel to enter [[Neah Bay, Washington|Neah Bay]], in July 1787. [[John Meares]], in the ''Feliz Aventureira'', stopped at Neah Bay in June 1788, and Charles Duncan in the ''[[Princess Royal (sloop)|Princess Royal]]'' did so in August 1788. [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]], in the ''Lady Washington'', entered Neah Bay in April 1789, and in July 1789 [[José María Narváez]] did so in the ''Santa Gertrudis la Magna''. Within the next few years a number of others visited Neah Bay and it became an important fur trading stop during the maritime fur trading era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tovell |first= Freeman M. |title= At the Far Reaches of Empire: The Life of Juan Francisco De La Bodega Y Quadra |publisher= [[University of British Columbia Press]] |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-7748-1367-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E8_LXicsIlEC |page= 212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After six members of his crew were killed by indigenous people, on 24 July 1787, near the mouth of the [[Hoh River]],&lt;ref&gt;''At the Far Reaches of Empire'', p. 412n20&lt;/ref&gt; Barkley decided to set sail for [[Guangzhou]] (Canton), [[Qing Dynasty|China]], to sell his sea otter pelts. He arrived in [[Macau]] in December 1787. His trading venture resulted in a profit of £10,000.&lt;ref name=frances/&gt; Barkley gave the name Destruction River to what is now called the Hoh River, after his crew members were killed by the indigenous people. The name has since been transferred to nearby [[Destruction Island]].   The Native Hawaiian maidservant named Wynee (Winée) was left in China.  Later she was found there by [[John Meares]] and sailed with him back to her homeland but she died of illness on 5 February 1788 during the voyage and her body was committed to the deep.&lt;ref name="Meares"&gt;{{cite journal |work= Hawaiian Historical Society Reprints (1787, 1788, and 1789). Extracts from Voyage Made in the Years 1788 and 1789 From China to the Northwest Coast of America, with an Introductory Narrative of a Voyage Performed in 1786, From Bengal, in the Ship "Nootka" |author= John Meares |url= http://hdl.handle.net/10524/643 |origyear=1791  |year= 1916 |volume= |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then left China and sailed with a cargo to [[Mauritius]]. While in Mauritius, Barkley learned that the East India Company was taking legal action against the owners of the ''Imperial Eagle'' for trading without a license. The owners, including [[John Meares]], decided to avoid the legal problems by selling the ''Imperial Eagle'' and breaking their contract with Barkley.&lt;ref name=frances/&gt; Charles and Frances Barkley stayed in Mauritius for over a year, where they had their first child. They then sailed to [[Kolkata]] (Calcutta), India, where the ''Imperial Eagle'' was confiscated. Barkley sued for damages and received £5,000 for the loss of his ten-year contract.&lt;ref name=cabio/&gt; At the same time, John Meares gained possession of Barkley's nautical gear and his journal. Frances Barkley later wrote that Meares, "with the greatest effrontery, published and claimed the merit of my husband's discoveries therein contained, besides inventing lies of the most revolting nature tending to vilify the person he thus pilfered."&lt;ref name=frances/&gt;

===Later years===
After this series of events Charles and Frances Barkley found themselves stranded in Mauritius, without a ship and burdened with a newborn. Over the course of two years they managed to make their way to the Netherlands, then England.&lt;ref name=frances/&gt; Frances was the first woman to sail around the world without deception. Only two women are known to have sailed around the world before Frances: [[Jeanne Baré]], disguised as a man, and Rose de Freycinet, wife of [[Louis de Freycinet]], as a stowaway.
&lt;ref name="frances"/&gt;

Barkley continued his merchant captain career. He commanded the ''Princess Frederica'', sailing in the Indian Ocean into 1791. Then he returned to the Pacific Northwest coast, in command of the 80-ton [[brig]] ''Halcyon''. He traded for sea otter pelts in [[Sitka Sound]], then sailed to the [[Hawaiian Islands]], China, and Mauritius.&lt;ref name=cabio/&gt;

Little is known of his latter years. They were probably not prosperous. Upon his death at the age of 73 he left two sons and two daughters, and was survived by his wife Frances.&lt;ref name=cabio/&gt;

==Legacy==
*[[Barkley Sound]] between [[Ucluelet]] and [[Bamfield]] on the west coast of [[Vancouver Island]] is named for him.
*The Seamen wrote Charles Barkley in 2018, a rap song that has many references to the explorer.

'''Cutta Cutta Caves Nature Park''' is a reserve covering 1,499 hectares of [[limestone]] [[Karst]] landscape near the town of [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]], in [[Australia]]'s [[Northern Territory]]. The park is easily accessible from the [[Stuart Highway]], about {{convert|27|km|abbr=on}} south of Katherine, and features two [[show caves]] where guided tours are offered to the public, making it a popular tourist attraction. The caves are the only tropical examples in Australia which are open to the public.

Cutta Cutta Caves are associated with ''Barrac Barrac'', or Diver Duck [[Dreaming (spirituality)|dreaming]] creation stories by the local [[Jawoyn]] [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] people.&lt;ref name=management&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/?a=10087|title=Cutta Cutta Caves Nature Park Plan of Management|publisher=Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory|date=November 2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810143649/http://www.parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/?a=10087|archivedate=2014-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, such as [[Lonely Planet]], claim Cutta Cutta is a Jawoyn word meaning "many stars", as they believe that caves are where the stars rest during the day;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia/northern-territory/cutta-cutta-caves-nature-park/sights/other/cutta-cutta-caves-nature-park|title=Cutta Cutta Caves Nature Park|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there does not seem to be a specific name for the formations in the documented or oral history. Evidence of occupation by the Jawoyn people can be found throughout the park with a number of campsites and stone artifacts identified. At least one unnamed cave within the park shows evidence of man-made grooves on an interior wall some distance from the entrance,&lt;ref name=management /&gt; although it is widely understood that the Jawoyn people did not regularly enter the deep caves.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Following European settlement, the main cave was discovered by a stockman around 1900, and has been known by several names. Initially Smith's Cave, during [[World War II]], servicemen called it 16 Mile Cave. In 1967 the caves were placed under the management of the Northern Territory Reserves Board as the Sixteen Mile Caves Reserve, and guided tours commenced. In 1979, the park changed to its current name and in 1991, a second cave, Tindal Cave, was opened to the public, which has since been closed.
Only one cave is open for guided tours. Cutta Cutta Cave extends {{convert|750|m|abbr=on}}, with {{convert|240|m|abbr=on}} accessible to the public with lighting and walkways. There are a number of other cave systems within the park which are not open to the public.&lt;ref name=management /&gt;

In addition to a visitor centre and kiosk, the park offers a Tropical Woodland walk, with information for visitors about the local flora and fauna. The caves are subject to flooding during the tropical [[wet season]] and may be closed for periods of time. As well as limestone [[stalactite]] and [[stalagmite]] formations, a number of rare species can be observed in and around the caves including the carnivorous [[ghost bat]] and the [[brown tree snake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/tourismtopend/docs/kath_guide_2013/20|title=The Essential Katherine Region Visitor Guide 2013-14|author=Melissa White|publisher=Issuu|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital Radio Mondiale''' ('''DRM'''; ''mondiale'' being [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] for "worldwide") is a set of [[digital radio|digital audio broadcasting]] technologies designed to work over the bands currently used for analogue radio broadcasting including [[AM broadcasting]], particularly [[shortwave]], and [[FM broadcasting]]. DRM is more spectrally efficient than AM and FM, allowing more stations, at higher quality, into a given amount of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], using various [[MPEG-4]] [[audio coding format]]s.

Digital Radio Mondiale is also the name of the international [[non-profit]] [[consortium]] that has designed the platform and is now promoting its introduction. [[Radio France Internationale]], [[TéléDiffusion de France]], [[BBC World Service]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Voice of America]], [[Telefunken]] (now [[Transradio]]) and Thomcast (now [[Ampegon]]) took part at the formation of the DRM consortium.

The principle of DRM is that bandwidth is the limited element, and computer processing power is cheap; modern [[Central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive audio compression techniques enable more efficient use of available bandwidth, at the expense of processing resources.

==Features==

DRM can deliver up to [[frequency modulation|FM]]-comparable sound quality{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} on frequencies below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[long wave]], [[medium wave]] and [[short wave]]), which allow for very-long-distance signal propagation. The modes for these lower frequencies are often collectively known under the term "DRM30". In the VHF bands, the term "DRM+" is used. DRM+ is able to use available broadcast spectra between 30 and 300&amp;nbsp;MHz; generally this means band I (47 to 68&amp;nbsp;MHz), band II (87.5 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz) and band III (174 to 230&amp;nbsp;MHz). DRM has been designed to be able to re-use portions of existing analogue [[transmitter]] facilities such as antennas, feeders, and, especially for DRM30, the transmitters themselves, avoiding major new investment. DRM is robust against the fading and interference which often plague conventional broadcasting in these frequency ranges.

The encoding and decoding can be performed with [[digital signal processing]], so that a cheap [[embedded system|embedded]] computer with a conventional transmitter and receiver can perform the rather complex encoding and decoding.

As a digital medium, DRM can transmit other data besides the audio channels ([[datacasting]]) &amp;mdash; as well as [[RBDS|RDS]]-type [[metadata]] or [[program-associated data]] as [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) does. DRM services can be operated in many different network configurations, from a traditional AM one-service one-transmitter model to a multi-service (up to four) multi-transmitter model, either as a [[single-frequency network]] (SFN) or [[multi-frequency network]] (MFN). Hybrid operation, where the same transmitter delivers both analogue and DRM services simultaneously is also possible.

DRM incorporates technology known as Emergency Warning Features that can override other programming and activates radios which are in standby in order to receive emergency broadcasts.

==Status==
The technical standard is available free-of-charge from the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/201900_201999/201980/04.01.01_60/es_201980v040101p.pdf|title=DRM System specification|author=|date=|website=etsi.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] has approved its use in most of the world. Approval for [[ITU region|ITU region 2]] is pending amendments to existing international agreements. The inaugural broadcast took place on June 16, 2003, in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], at the ITU's [[World Radio Conference]].

Current broadcasters include [[All India Radio]], [[BBC World Service]], [[BitExpress]], [[Radio Exterior de España]], [[Radio New Zealand International]], [[Vatican Radio]], [[Radio Romania International]] and Radio Kuweit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm.org/?page_id=151|title=Digital Radio Mondiale -   Broadcast Schedule|author=|date=|website=www.drm.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until now DRM receivers have typically used a [[personal computer]]. A few manufacturers have introduced DRM receivers which have thus far remained niche products due to limited choice of broadcasts. It is expected that the transition of national broadcasters to digital services on DRM, notably All India Radio, will stimulate the production of a new generation of affordable, and efficient receivers.

[[Chengdu NewStar Electronics]] is offering the DR111 from May 2012 on which meets the minimum requirements for DRM receivers specified by the DRM consortium and is sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DR111 DRM Radio |publisher=Chengdu NewStar Electronics &amp;#124; 成都纽斯达电子公司: |year=2014 |url=http://www.cdnse.com/products/dr111 |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Overseas Service of [[All India Radio]] broadcasts daily in DRM to Western Europe on 9.95&amp;nbsp;MHz at 17:45 to 22:30 UTC.&lt;ref&gt;http://allindiaradio.gov.in/Services/Digital%20Transmission/Pages/simple.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  [[All India Radio]] is in the process of replacing and refurbishing many of its domestic AM transmitters with DRM. The project which began in 2012 is scheduled to complete during 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm.org/?page_id=2494|title=Digital Radio Mondiale -   DRM India Page|author=|date=|website=www.drm.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Broadcasting Corporation [[BBC]] has trialed the technology in the [[United Kingdom]] by broadcasting [[BBC Radio Devon]] in the Plymouth area in the MF band. The [http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/digitalmediumwave/faqs_feature.shtml trial] lasted for a year (April 2007 – April 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2009/05/11/digital_medium_wave_report_feature.shtml|title=Digital medium wave trial report|first=|last=BBC|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[BBC]] also trialed DRM+ in the FM band in 2010 from the [[Craigkelly transmitting station]] in [[Fife]], Scotland, over an area which included the city of [[Edinburgh]]. In this trial, a previously used 10&amp;nbsp;kW (ERP) FM transmitter was replaced with a 1&amp;nbsp;kW DRM+ transmitter in two different modes and the coverage compared with FM &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP199.pdf|title=BBC Research White Paper WHP199|author=|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Digital Radio Mondiale was included in the 2007 [[Ofcom]] consultation on the future of radio in the [[United Kingdom]] for the AM medium wave band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/futureradio/ The Future of Radio (Ofcom, 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043938/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/futureradio/ |date=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTÉ has also run single and multiple programme overnight tests during a similar period on the 252&amp;nbsp;kHz LW transmitter in Trim, Co.Meath, Ireland which was upgraded to support DRM after [[Atlantic 252]] closed.

On 28 September 2006, the [[Australia]]n spectrum regulator, the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]], announced that it had "placed an embargo on frequency bands potentially suitable for use by broadcasting services using Digital Radio Mondiale until spectrum planning can be completed" "those bands being "5,950–6,200; 7,100–7,300; 9,500–9,900; 11,650–12,050; 13,600–13,800; 15,100–15,600; 17,550–17,900; 21,450–21,850 and 25,670–26,100&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]]: [http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/radcomm/frequency_planning/spectrum_embargoes/embargo44.pdf Embargo on new frequency assignments to support domestic broadcasting services using DRM tecxhnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] [[Federal Communications Commission]] states in {{CodeFedReg|47|73|758}} that:  "For digitally modulated emissions, the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) standard shall be employed."  Part 73, section 758 is for [[high frequency|HF]] broadcasting only.

==Technological Overview==

===Audio source coding===
Useful bitrates for DRM30 range from 6.1 kbit/s (Mode D) to 34.8 kbit/s (Mode A) for a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth (±5&amp;nbsp;kHz around the central frequency). It is possible to achieve bit rates up to 72 kbit/s (Mode A) by using a standard 20&amp;nbsp;kHz (±10&amp;nbsp;kHz) wide channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, pure digital [[HD Radio]] can broadcast 20 kbit/s using channels 10&amp;nbsp;kHz wide and up to 60 kbit/s using 20&amp;nbsp;kHz channels.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiquity.com/i/pdfs/Waveforms_AM.pdf |title=The Structure and Generation of Robust Waveforms for AM In-Band On-Channel Digital Broadcasting |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206042040/http://www.ibiquity.com/i/pdfs/Waveforms_AM.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Useful bitrate depends also on other parameters, such as:
* desired robustness to errors ([[Forward error correction|error coding]])
* power needed ([[modulation]] scheme)
* robustness in regard to propagation conditions ([[multipath propagation]], [[doppler effect]]), etc.

When DRM was originally designed, it was clear that the most robust modes offered insufficient capacity for the then state-of-the-art audio coding format [[MPEG-4]] [[HE-AAC]] (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). Therefore, the standard launched with a choice of three different audio coding systems (source coding) depending on the bitrate:
*[[MPEG-4]]  [[HE-AAC]] (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). AAC is a perceptual coder suited for voice and music and the High Efficiency is an optional extension for reconstruction of high frequencies (SBR: spectral bandwidth replication) and stereo image (PS: Parametric Stereo). 24&amp;nbsp;kHz or 12&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling frequencies can be used for core AAC (no SBR) which correspond respectively to 48&amp;nbsp;kHz and 24&amp;nbsp;kHz when using SBR oversampling.
*[[MPEG-4]] [[CELP]] which is a parametric coder suited for voice only (vocoder) but that is robust to errors and needs a small bit rate.
*[[MPEG-4]] [[HVXC]] which is also a parametric coder for speech programs that uses an even smaller bitrate than CELP.

However, with the development of [[MPEG-4]] [[xHE-AAC]], which is an implementation of MPEG [[Unified Speech and Audio Coding]], the DRM standard was updated and the two speech-only coding formats, CELP and HVXC, were replaced. USAC is designed to combine the properties of a speech and a general audio coding according to bandwidth constraints and so is able to handle all kinds of programme material. Given that there were few CELP and HVXC broadcasts on-air, the decision to drop the speech-only coding formats has passed without issue.

Many broadcasters still use the [[HE-AAC]] coding format because it still offers an acceptable audio quality, somewhat comparable to [[FM broadcasting|FM broadcast]] at bitrates above about 15 kbit/s. However, it is anticipated that in future, most broadcasters will adopt [[xHE-AAC]].

Additionally, as of v2.1, the popular Dream software can broadcast using the [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] coding format. Whilst not within the current DRM standard the inclusion of this codec is provided for experimentation. Aside from perceived technical advantages over the MPEG family such as low latency (delay between coding and decoding), this codec provides an open source (therefore free to use) alternative to the proprietary MPEG family whose use is permitted at the discretion of the patent holders, unfortunately it has a substantially lower audio quality than xHE-AAC on low bitrates, which are a key to conserve bandwidth. In fact, at 8Kbps Opus actually sounds worse than analog shortwave radio. A video showing the comparison between Opus and xHE-AAC is available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEUwScTX-R4 here]. Equipment manufacturers currently pay royalties for incorporating the MPEG codecs.

===Bandwidth===
DRM broadcasting can be done using a choice of different bandwidths:

*4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a [[simulcast]] and use the lower-sideband area of a 9&amp;nbsp;kHz raster channel for [[amplitude modulation|AM]], with a 4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102500_102599/102509/01.01.01_60/ts_102509v010101p.pdf |title=See section 5: "DRM/AM single channel simulcast"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is not good.
*5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a [[simulcast]] and use the lower-sideband area of a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz raster channel for AM, with a 5&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband. However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is marginal (7.1–16.7&amp;nbsp;kbit/s for 5&amp;nbsp;kHz). This technique could be used on the [[short wave]] bands throughout the world. 
*9&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region&amp;nbsp;1 long wave or medium wave broadcast channel.
*10&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region&amp;nbsp;2 broadcast channel. could be used to simulcast with analogue audio channel restricted to NRSC5. Occupies a full worldwide short wave broadcast channel (giving 14.8–34.8 kbit/s)
*18&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region&amp;nbsp;1 long wave or medium wave channels according to the existing frequency plan. This offers better audio quality.
*20&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region&amp;nbsp;2 or region 3 AM channel according to the existing frequency plan. This offers highest audio quality of the DRM30 standard (giving 30.6–72&amp;nbsp;kbit/s).
* 100&amp;nbsp;kHz for DRM+. This bandwidth can be used in band I, II, and III and DRM+ can transmit four different programs in this bandwidth or even one low definition digital video channel.

===Modulation===
The modulation used for DRM is coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ([[COFDM]]), where every carrier is modulated with quadrature amplitude modulation ([[QAM]]) with a selectable error coding.

The choice of transmission parameters depends on signal robustness wanted and propagation conditions. Transmission signal is affected by noise, interference, multipath wave propagation and [[Doppler effect]].

It is possible to choose among several error coding schemes and several modulation patterns: 64-QAM, 16-QAM and 4-QAM. OFDM modulation has some parameters that must be adjusted depending on propagation conditions. This is the carrier spacing which will determine the robustness against Doppler effect (which cause frequencies offsets, spread: Doppler spread) and OFDM guard interval which determine robustness against multipath propagation (which cause delay offsets, spread: delay spread). The DRM consortium has determined four different profiles corresponding to typical propagation conditions:
*A: Gaussian channel with very little multipath propagation and Doppler effect. This profile is suited for local or regional broadcasting.
*B: multipath propagation channel. This mode is suited for medium range transmission. It is nowadays frequently used.
*C: similar to mode B, but with better robustness to Doppler (more carrier spacing). This mode is suited for long distance transmission.
*D: similar to mode B, but with a resistance to large delay spread and Doppler spread. This case exists with adverse propagation conditions on very long distance transmissions. The useful bit rate for this profile is decreased.

The trade-off between these profiles stands between robustness, resistance in regards to propagation conditions and useful bit rates for the service. This table presents some values depending on these profiles. The larger the carrier spacing, the more the system is resistant to Doppler effect (Doppler spread). The larger the guard interval, the greater the resistance to long multipath propagation errors (delay spread).

The resulting low-[[bit rate]] digital information is [[modulation|modulated]] using [[COFDM]]. It can run in [[simulcast]] mode by switching between DRM and AM, and it is also prepared for linking to other alternatives (e.g., [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] or FM services).

DRM has been tested successfully on [[shortwave]], [[mediumwave]] (with 9 as well as 10 [[kHz]] [[channel spacing]]) and [[longwave]].

There is also a lower bandwidth two-way communication version of DRM as a replacement for SSB communications on HF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://n1su.com/windrm/|title=WinDRM] - software for Audio and Fast Data over HF SSB |author=|date=|website=n1su.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - note that it is ''not'' compatible with the official DRM specification. It may be possible in some future time for the 4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth DRM version used by the Amateur Radio community to be merged with the existing DRM specification.

The Dream software will receive the commercial versions and also limited transmission mode using the FAAC AAC encoder.

===Error coding===
Error coding can be chosen to be more or less robust.

The lower the protection class the higher the level of error correction.

==DRM+ ==
While the initial DRM standard covered the broadcasting bands below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz, the DRM consortium voted in March 2005 to begin the process of extending the system to the VHF bands up to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151234/http://www.drm.org/uploads/files/drm_plus_pres.pdf DRM+ Presentation], DRM.org, accessed 2009-02-02&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2009, DRM+ (Mode E) became an official broadcasting standard with the publication of the technical specification by the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]; this is effectively a new release of the whole DRM spec with the additional mode permitting operation above 30&amp;nbsp;MHz up to 174&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;ETSI ES 201 980 V3.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Wider bandwidth channels are used, which allows radio stations to use higher bit rates, thus providing higher audio quality. A 100&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM+ channel has sufficient capacity to carry one low-definition 0.7 megabit/s wide mobile TV channel: it would be feasible to distribute [[mobile TV]] over DRM+ rather than [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]] or [[DVB-H]]. However, DRM+ (DRM Mode E) as designed and standardized only provides bitrates between 37.2 and 186.3&amp;nbsp;kbit/s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= DRM Introduction and Implementation Guide | publisher=DRM Consortium | date=13 September 2013 | url=http://www.drm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DRM-guide-artwork-9-2013-1.pdf | pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://drm-forum.de/images/drm-forum/drm-workshop-2016/Use_of_DRMplus_in_the_FM_Band.pdf | title=Use of DRM+ in the FM Band 87.5-108MHz | pages=6 | first=Jens | last=Schroeder | date=April 2016 | publisher=Deutsches DRM-Forum }}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on robustness level, using 4-QAM or 16-QAM modulations and 100&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth.

DRM+ has been successfully tested in all the VHF bands, and this gives the DRM system the widest frequency usage; it can be used in band I, II and III. DRM+ can coexist with DAB in band III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm-radio-kl.eu/symposium2010/symposium2010en.htm|title=Symposium DRM+ im VHF-Band III in Kaiserslautern|author=|date=|website=www.drm-radio-kl.eu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also the present FM-band can be utilized. The ITU has published three recommendations on DRM+, known in the documents as Digital System G. This indicate  the introduction of the full DRM system (DRM 30 and DRM+).
ITU-R Rec. BS.1114 is the ITU recommendation for sound broadcasting in the frequency range 30&amp;nbsp;MHz to 3&amp;nbsp;GHz. DAB, HD-Radio and ISDB-T were already recommended in this document as Digital Systems A, C and F respectively.

In 2011, the paneuropean organisation Community Media Forum Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmfe.eu|title=Community Media Forum Europe - Information and Lobbying for the Community Media Sector|author=|date=|website=cmfe.eu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has recommended to the European Commission that DRM+ should rather be used for small scale broadcasting (local radio, community radio) than DAB/DAB+.

'''Dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide''' (also '''dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide''' or '''DODAB''') is a double-chained quaternary ammonium [[surfactant]] that forms unilamellar [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]]  (ULVs) in water. Among various preparation methods, the ‘‘hot-water” method offers a simple procedure to prepare DODAB [[cationic]] vesicles by simply dissolving the DODAB in hot water above 50 °C, i.e., chain melting (main) [[Transition state|transition]], Tm.
In general, the [[Differential scanning calorimetry|DSC]] thermograms of the unsonicated DODAB [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersions]] are dominated by two endotherms; the pre- (35–36 °C) and main transition (42.7–45 °C) peaks. Moreover, in literature reported the presence of a third
endotherm (post transition) at 52.2 °C.
The main transition (Tm) is ascribed to [[gel]] to liquid-crystalline phase transition in which the alkyl chains transform from solidlike to liquid-like state.

The 10 mM DODAB is a critical [[concentration]], below which the dispersions consist of large polydispersed unilamellar vesicles (ULVs) that exhibit a local (chain melting) transition at 43 °C, beyond which a structural transition occurs: ULVs --&gt; MLVs (multilamellar vesicles) as indicated by the sudden increase in the dynamic moduli. However, above 10 mM DODAB, the dispersions are mostly formed by ULVs in coexistence with lamellar fragments resulting in a network that shows a rheogram similar to that of hexagonal liquid-crystalline phase.

'''Earth's circumference''' is the [[Circumference|distance around]] the [[Earth]], either around the [[equator]] ({{convert|40075.017|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=x}}&lt;ref&gt;[[World Geodetic System]] (''WGS-84''). [http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/ Available online] from [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]].&lt;/ref&gt;) or around the [[meridional|poles]] ({{convert|40007.86|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=x}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Sigurd |last1=Humerfelt |date=26 October 2010 |title=How WGS 84 defines Earth |url=http://home.online.no/~sigurdhu/WGS84_Eng.html |accessdate=29 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424104419/http://home.online.no/~sigurdhu/WGS84_Eng.html |archivedate=24 April 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Measurement of Earth's circumference has been important to [[navigation]] since ancient times. It was first calculated by [[Eratosthenes]], which he did by comparing altitudes of the mid-day sun at two places a known North-South distance apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Universe|last=Ridpath|first=Ian|publisher=Watson-Guptill|year=2001|isbn=0-8230-2512-8|location=New York, NY|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages, [[Al Biruni]] calculated a more accurate version, becoming the first person to perform the calculation based on data from a single location.

In modern times it has been used to define fundamental units of measurement of length – the nautical mile in the seventeenth century and the metre in the eighteenth. Earth's polar circumference is almost exactly 40,000 km because [[History of the metre|the metre was originally calibrated]] on this measurement (1/10-millionth of the distance between the poles and the equator), which is almost exactly 21,600 nautical miles (being defined as one [[Minute and second of arc|minute of a degree]] – i.e. 360 multiplied by 60).

It has been described as "the single most important measurement" of the Earth, assuming the Earth to be a sphere (the Earth is an technically an [[ellipsoid]], albeit with just 0.3% [[flattening]]).&lt;ref name="ShekharXiong2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shashi Shekhar|author2=Hui Xiong|title=Encyclopedia of GIS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6q2lOfLnwkAC&amp;pg=PA638|date=12 December 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-30858-6|pages=638–640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's circumference lines are the foundation of the [[coordinate system]] of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. 

Longditude lines, also known as [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] lines, follow the polar circumference, and are all exactly the same length.&lt;ref name="ShekharXiong2007"/&gt;

Latitude lines, known as [[Circle of latitude|circles of latitude]] are parallel to each other; the [[equator|equatorial]] circumference is the largest circle of latitude, and the Earth’s longest circumference distance.&lt;ref name="ShekharXiong2007"/&gt; Other circles of latitude have smaller circumference; for example, the [[60th parallel north]] or [[60th parallel south|south]] is approximately half as long as the Equator.&lt;ref name="ShekharXiong2007"/&gt;

==History of calculation==

[[File:Eratosthenes.png|thumb|left|Illustration showing a portion of the globe showing a part of the African continent. The sun beams shown as two rays hitting earth at Syene and Alexandria. Angle of sun beam and the gnomons (vertical sticks) is shown at Alexandria which allowed Eratosthenes' estimate of the circumference of Earth.]]
According to [[Cleomedes]]' ''On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies'', around 240 BC, [[Eratosthenes]], the librarian of the [[Library of Alexandria]], calculated the [[Earth radius|circumference of the Earth]] in [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first= Albert |last= Van Helden |title= Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley |publisher= University of Chicago Press |date= 1985 |pages= 4–5 |isbn= 0-226-84882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a [[scaphe]], he knew that at [[Noon#Solar noon|local noon]] on the summer solstice in [[Syene]] (modern [[Aswan]], Egypt), the Sun was directly overhead. (Syene is at latitude 24°05′ North, near to the [[Tropic of Cancer]], which was 23°42′ North in 100 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FruHOlKlbJAC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=%22Tropic+of+Cancer%22+BC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tropic+of+Cancer%22+BC&amp;f=false|title=Story of the Delhi Iron Pillar|first=R.|last=Balasubramaniam|date=10 August 2017|publisher=Foundation Books|via=Google Books|isbn=9788175962781}}&lt;/ref&gt;) He knew this because the shadow of someone looking down a deep well at that time in Syene blocked the reflection of the Sun on the water. He then measured the Sun's angle of elevation at noon in Alexandria by using a vertical rod, known as a [[gnomon]], and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eg.bucknell.edu/physics/astronomy/astr101/specials/eratosthenes.html|title=Astronomy 101 Specials: Eratosthenes and the Size of the Earth|website=www.eg.bucknell.edu|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the length of the rod, and the length of the shadow, as the legs of a triangle, he calculated the angle of the sun's rays.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anthonybloggeneral.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/eratosthenes-earth-circumference/|title=How did Eratosthenes measure the circumference of the earth?|date=3 July 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This angle was about 7°, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle; taking the Earth as perfectly spherical, he concluded that the Earth's circumference was 50 times the known distance from Alexandra to Syene (5,000 stadia, a figure that was checked yearly), i.e. 250,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]].&lt;ref name="stade"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/convergence/eratosthenes-and-the-mystery-of-the-stades-how-long-is-a-stade|title=Eratosthenes and the Mystery of the Stades – How Long Is a Stade? – Mathematical Association of America|website=www.maa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on whether he used the "Olympic stade" (176.4m) or the Italian stade (184.8m), this would imply a circumference of 44,100&amp;nbsp;km (an error of 10%) or 46,100&amp;nbsp;km, an error of 15%.&lt;ref name="stade" /&gt; In 2012, Anthony Abreu Mora repeated Eratosthenes's calculation with more accurate data; the result was 40,074&amp;nbsp;km, which is 66&amp;nbsp;km different (0.16%) from the currently accepted polar circumference.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Posidonius calculated the [[Earth]]'s [[circumference]] by reference to the position of the star [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]]. As explained by Cleomedes, Posidonius observed Canopus on but never above the horizon at Rhodes, while at [[Alexandria]] he saw it ascend as far as 7½ degrees above the horizon (the [[meridian arc]] between the latitude of the two locales is actually 5 degrees 14 minutes). Since he thought Rhodes was 5,000 [[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] due north of Alexandria, and the difference in the star's elevation indicated the distance between the two locales was 1/48 of the circle, he multiplied 5,000 by 48 to arrive at a figure of 240,000 stadia for the circumference of the earth.&lt;ref name="fragment 202"&gt;Posidonius, [http://www.attalus.org/translate/poseidonius.html#202.K fragment 202]&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally thought that the stadion used by Posidonius was almost exactly 1/10 of a modern statute mile. Thus Posidonius's measure of 240,000 stadia translates to {{cvt|24000|mi|km}}, not much short of the actual circumference of {{cvt|24901|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="fragment 202"/ [[Strabo]] noted that the distance between Rhodes and Alexandria is 3,750 stadia, and reported Posidonius's estimate of the Earth's circumference to be 180,000 stadia or {{cvt|18000|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;Cleomedes ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975QJRAS..16..152F in Fragment 202]) stated that if the distance is measured by some other number the result will be different, and using 3,750 instead of 5,000 produces this estimation: 3,750 x 48 = 180,000; see Fischer I., (1975), ''Another Look at Eratosthenes' and Posidonius' Determinations of the Earth's Circumference'', Ql. J. of the Royal Astron. Soc., Vol. 16, p.152.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions Posidonius among his sources and without naming him reported his method for estimating the Earth's circumference. He noted, however, that [[Hipparchus]] had added some 26,000 stadia to Eratosthenes's estimate. The smaller value offered by Strabo and the different lengths of Greek and Roman stadia have created a persistent confusion around Posidonius's result. [[Ptolemy]] used Posidonius's lower value of 180,000 stades (about 33% too low) for the earth's circumference in his [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']]. This was the number used by [[Christopher Columbus]] in order to underestimate the distance to India as 70,000 stades.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Freely]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=MfhjAAAAQBAJ ''Before Galileo: The Birth of Modern Science in Medieval Europe''] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abu Reyhan Biruni-Earth Circumference.svg|thumb|Diagram showing how Al Biruni was able to calculate the Earth’s circumference from a high point and a low point at the same location.]]
A more accurate estimate was provided in [[Al-Biruni]]'s ''Codex Masudicus'' (1037).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=King|first=David A.|year=1996|editor-last=Rashed|editor-first=Roshdi|title=Astronomy and Islamic society: Qibla, gnomics and timekeeping|url=http://qisar.fssr.uns.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Qisar-Roshdi-Rashed-Encyclopedia-of-the-History-of-Arabic-Science.pdf|journal=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science|volume=1|pages=128–184|isbn=978-0203711842|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/histgeol/biruni/biruni.htm|title=Abu Rayhan al-Biruni|last=Aber|first=James Sandusky|date=2003|website=academic.emporia.edu|publisher=[[Emporia State University]]|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to his predecessors, who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, [[al-Biruni]] developed a new method of using [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] calculations, based on the angle between a [[plain]] and [[mountain]] top, which yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference, and made it possible for it to be measured by a single person from a single location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VJ6x-pcqMicC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;q=biruni|title=Avicenna|last=Goodman|first=Lenn Evan|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=978-0415019293|location=Great Britain|pages=31|quote=It was Biruni, not Avicenna, who found a way for a single man, at a single moment, to measure the earth's circumference, by trigonometric calculations based on angles measured from a mountaintop and the plain beneath it – thus improving on Eratosthenes' method of sighting the sun simultaneously from two different sites, applied in  the ninth century by astronomers of the Khalif al-Ma'mun.|access-date=10 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1,700 years after Eratosthenes's death, while [[Christopher Columbus]] studied what Eratosthenes had written about the size of the Earth, he chose to believe, based on a map by [[Toscanelli]], that the Earth's circumference was one-third smaller. Had Columbus set sail knowing that Eratosthenes's larger circumference value was more accurate, he would have known that the place that he made landfall was not Asia, but rather the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;Gow, Mary.

==Units of measurement based on Earth’s circumference==
Both the [[metre]] and the [[nautical mile]] were once calculated as a subdivision of the Earth's circumference.

In 1617 the Dutch scientist [[Willebrord Snellius]] assessed the circumference of the Earth at 24,630 Roman miles (24,024 statute miles). Around that time British mathematician [[Edmund Gunter]] improved navigational tools including a new [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] to determine latitude at sea. He reasoned that the lines of latitude could be used as the basis for a unit of measurement for [[distance]] and proposed the nautical mile as one minute or one-sixtieth ({{sfrac|1|60}}) of one [[Degree (angle)|degree]] of latitude. As one degree is {{sfrac|1|360}} of a circle, one minute of arc is {{sfrac|1|21600}} of a circle. Gunter used Snell's circumference to define a nautical mile as 6,080 feet, the length of one minute of arc at 48 degrees latitude.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Insight, [https://www.marineinsight.com/guidelines/nautical-mile-knot-units-used-sea/ Why Nautical Mile and Knot Are The Units Used at Sea?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] selected the circumference definition over the alternative pendular definition because the force of [[Gravitation|gravity]] [[Geoid|varies slightly]] over the surface of the Earth, which affects the period of a pendulum.&lt;ref name="Alder2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alder|first=Ken|title=The Measure of All Things: The Seven-Year Odyssey and Hidden Error That Transformed the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwsDERPMPhsC|date=October 2003|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-1676-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To establish a universally accepted foundation for the definition of the metre, more accurate measurements of this meridian were needed. The French Academy of Sciences commissioned an expedition led by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]] and [[Pierre Méchain]], lasting from 1792 to 1799, which attempted to accurately measure the distance between a belfry in [[Dunkirk|Dunkerque]] and [[Montjuïc castle]] in [[Barcelona]] to estimate the length of the [[meridian arc]] through Dunkerque. This portion of the meridian, assumed to be the same length as the [[Paris meridian]], was to serve as the basis for the length of the half meridian connecting the North Pole with the Equator. The problem with this approach is that the exact shape of the Earth is not a simple mathematical shape, such as a [[sphere]] or [[oblate spheroid]], at the level of precision required for defining a standard of length. The irregular and particular shape of the Earth smoothed to sea level is represented by a mathematical model called a [[geoid]], which literally means "Earth-shaped". Despite these issues, in 1793 France adopted this definition of the metre as its official unit of length based on provisional results from this expedition. However, it was later determined that the first prototype metre bar was short by about 200 micrometres because of miscalculation of the [[flattening]] of the Earth, making the prototype about 0.02% shorter than the original proposed definition of the metre. Regardless, this length became the French standard and was progressively adopted by other countries in Europe.&lt;ref name="Alder2003"/&gt;

'''Earth observation satellites''' or '''Earth remote sensing satellites''' are [[satellite]]s specifically designed for [[Earth observation]] from [[orbit]], similar to [[spy satellite]]s but intended for non-military uses such as [[natural environment|environment]]al monitoring, [[meteorology]], [[map making]] etc.  
The first occurrence of satellite remote sensing can be dated to the launch of the first artificial satellite, [[Sputnik 1]], by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957.&lt;ref name="Tatem"/&gt; Sputnik 1 sent back radio signals, which scientists used to study the [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name="Kuznetsov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznetsov|first1=V.D.|last2=Sinelnikov|first2=V.M.|last3=Alpert|first3=S.N.|title=Yakov Alpert: Sputnik-1 and the first satellite ionospheric experiment|journal=Advances in Space Research|date=June 2015|volume=55|issue=12|pages=2833–2839|doi=10.1016/j.asr.2015.02.033|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117715001623|accessdate=14 May 2018|bibcode=2015AdSpR..55.2833K}}&lt;/ref&gt;
NASA launched the first American satellite, [[Explorer 1]], in January 31, 1958. The information sent back from its radiation detector led to the discovery of the Earth's [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite web|title=James A. Van Allen|url=http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=86|website=International Space Hall of Fame|publisher=New Mexico Museum of Space History|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[TIROS-1]] spacecraft, launched on April 1, 1960 as part of NASA's [[TIROS]] (Television Infrared Observation Satellite) Program, sent back the first television footage of weather patterns to be taken from space.&lt;ref name="Tatem"/&gt;
{{As of|2008}}, more than 150 Earth observation satellites were in orbit, recording data with both passive and active sensors and acquiring more than 10 terabits of data daily.&lt;ref name="Tatem"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tatem|first1=Andrew J.|last2=Goetz|first2=Scott J.|last3=Hay|first3=Simon I.|title=Fifty Years of Earth-observation Satellites|journal=American Scientist|date=2008|volume=96|issue=5|pages=390|doi=10.1511/2008.74.390|accessdate=|pmc=2690060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Earth observation satellites carry instruments that should be operated at a relatively low altitude. Altitudes below 500-600 kilometers are in general avoided, though, because of the significant [[Drag (physics)|air-drag]] at such low altitudes making frequent orbit [[reboost]] maneuvres necessary.  The Earth observation satellites [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS-1, ERS-2]] and [[Envisat]] of [[European Space Agency]] as well as the [[MetOp]] spacecraft of [[EUMETSAT]] are all operated at altitudes of about 800&amp;nbsp;km. The [[PROBA|Proba-1]], [[Proba-2]] and [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite|SMOS]] spacecraft of European Space Agency are observing the Earth from an altitude of about 700&amp;nbsp;km. The Earth observation satellites of UAE, [[DubaiSat-1]] &amp; [[DubaiSat-2]] are also placed in [[Low Earth orbit|Low Earth Orbits (LEO)]] orbits and providing [[satellite imagery]] of various parts of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DubaiSat-2, Earth Observation Satellite of UAE|url=http://mbrsc.ae/en/page/dubai-sat-2|website=Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DubaiSat-1, Earth Observation Satellite of UAE|url=http://mbrsc.ae/en/page/dubai-sat-1|website=Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To get (nearly) global coverage with a low orbit it must be a [[polar orbit]] or nearly so.  A low orbit will have an orbital period of roughly 100 minutes and the Earth will rotate around its polar axis with about 25 deg between successive orbits, with the result that the [[ground track]] is shifted towards west with these 25 deg in longitude. Most are in [[sun-synchronous orbit]]s.

Spacecraft carrying instruments for which an altitude of 36000&amp;nbsp;km is suitable sometimes use a [[geostationary orbit]].  Such an orbit allows uninterrupted coverage of more than 1/3 of the Earth. Three geostationary spacecraft at longitudes separated with 120 deg can cover the whole Earth except the extreme polar regions. This type of orbit is mainly used for [[Weather satellite|meteorological satellites]].

==History==
[[Herman Potočnik]] explored the idea of using orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground in his 1928 book, ''The Problem of Space Travel''. He described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments. The book described [[geostationary]] satellites (first put forward by [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]]) and discussed communication between them and the ground using radio, but fell short of the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sasmac.cn/portal/html/fc4f335929b0df0d0129b0e348f90003/_content/10_07/09/1278668367217.html|title=Introduction to satellite|website=www.sasmac.cn|date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A weather satellite is a type of [[satellite]] that is primarily used to monitor the [[weather]] and [[climate]] of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="NESDIS"&gt;[[NESDIS]]. [http://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/satellites.html Satellites.] Retrieved on 2008-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt;  These meteorological satellites, however, see more than [[cloud]]s and cloud systems.  City lights, [[fire]]s, effects of [[pollution]], [[auroral light|aurora]]s, sand and dust storms, [[snow]] cover, [[ice]] mapping, boundaries of [[ocean current]]s, [[energy]] flows, etc., are other types of environmental information collected using weather satellites.

Weather satellite images helped in monitoring the volcanic ash cloud from [[Mount St. Helens]] and activity from other volcanoes such as [[Mount Etna]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NOAA]]. [http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=15216 NOAA Satellites, Scientists Monitor Mt. St. Helens for Possible Eruption.] Retrieved on 2008-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Smoke from [[forest fires|fires]]

==Environmental monitoring==
[[File:Whole world - land and oceans 12000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A composite satellite image of the earth, showing its entire surface in [[Plate carrée projection]].|left]]
Other environmental satellites can assist [[environmental monitoring]] by detecting changes in the Earth's vegetation, atmospheric trace gas content, sea state, ocean color, and ice fields.  By monitoring vegetation changes over time, droughts can be monitored by comparing the current vegetation state to its long term average.&lt;ref&gt;[[NASA]]. [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Drought/ Drought.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819121047/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Drought/ |date=2008-08-19 }} Retrieved on 2008-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the 2002 oil spill off the northwest coast of [[Spain]] was watched carefully by the European ENVISAT, which, though not a weather satellite, flies an instrument (ASAR) which can see changes in the sea surface. Anthropogenic emissions can be monitored by evaluating data of tropospheric NO2 and SO2.

These types of satellites are almost always in [[Sun synchronous orbit|Sun synchronous]] and [[Frozen orbit|"frozen"]] orbits.  The Sun synchronous orbit is in general sufficiently close to polar to get the desired global coverage while the relatively constant geometry to the Sun mostly is an advantage for the instruments.  The [[Frozen orbit|"frozen"]] orbit is selected as this is the closest to a circular orbit that is possible in the [[Geopotential model|gravitational field]] of the Earth.

==Mapping==
Terrain can be mapped from space with the use of satellites, such as [[Radarsat-1]]&lt;ref&gt;Grunsky, E.C. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/7969/22036/01024985.pdf?arnumber=1024985 The use of multi-beam RADARSAT-1 satellite imagery for terrain mapping.] Retrieved on 2008-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TerraSAR-X]].

In [[materials science]], the '''espresso crema effect''' is an analogue model for superficial material alteration.&lt;ref name=Tschegg/&gt; Alteration processes such as [[weathering]] can influence the physical character and chemical composition of matter near the surface, without affecting the bulk medium beneath. Increases in [[porosity]] can increase light [[refraction]], [[diffuse reflection]] and [[light scattering|scattering]], resulting in a brightening of the material's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Durian |first1=D.J. |last2=Weitz |first2=D.A. |last3=Pine |first3=D.J. |date=3 May 1991 |journal=Science |volume=252 |pages=686–8 |title=Multiple light-scattering probes of foam structure and dynamics|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/pine/reprints/1991-05-03-Science-Durian.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.252.5006.686 |pmid=17746666 |issue=5006|bibcode=1991Sci...252..686D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the physical changes, chemical differences compared to the bulk medium may be involved.

Because of increased gas–solid interfaces which result, for example due to selective leaching processes during burial, surfaces of ancient [[ceramic]]s can appear brighter than they originally were.&lt;ref name=Tschegg&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tschegg |first=C. |year=2009 |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2009.05.030 |quote=Sometimes called the &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''espresso crema effect''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;..., the surface becomes considerably brighter than the core... |title=Post-depositional surface whitening of ceramic artifacts: alteration mechanisms and consequences |volume=36 |pages=2155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has to be taken into account when categorizing and discussing archaeological ceramics.

==Circumnavigation==

===Bombay to Trinidad===

The sailing expedition commenced from [[Bombay]], India on 28 Sept 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=UNI |title=Yachting expedition flagged off |date=29 September 1985 |work=The Times of India |location = Bombay }}&lt;/ref&gt; Right from the time ''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' left harbour, she ran into the low pressure weather system of the receding monsoons which accompanied her till her first port of call at [[Male]] and thereafter to [[Mauritius]] on 25 October 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Trishna' set for last leg of expedition |page= |date=31 October 1985 |work=Indian Express |location=New Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/IndianExpress31Oct1985/Indian%20Express_31%20Oct%201985#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Indian Express 31 Oct 1985 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1985-10-31 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat was hit by severe storms on several occasions which damaged the VHF and HF radio aerials and electrical systems on board. The crew resorted to makeshift repairs at sea to restore communication and navigation systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=TPS |last=Chowdhury |title=Around the World in a Yacht |page=34 |date=15 January 1986 |work=Sainik Samachar |location=New Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After a brief halt, the boat set sail from [[Port Louis]], [[Mauritius]] on 30 October 1985. The sail to [[Saint Helena]], [[South Atlantic Ocean]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] was rough and the longest non-stop leg of the trip, taking 33 days. ''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' on one occasion was swamped by a rouge wave and lost most of her life saving equipment in the incident. The radio set was damaged and the antenna on the masthead broke. Communication with Mumbai and other ports was cut off. The sail across the South Atlantic Ocean was peaceful and ''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' reached [[St Helena]] on 2 December 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/FreePressJournal04Dec1985/Free%20Press%20Journal_04%20Dec%201985#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Free Press Journal 04 Dec 1985 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1985-12-04 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boat reached [[Ascension Island]] on 15 December 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Trishna' reaches Ascension Island |page= |date=23 December 1985 |work=National Herald |location=New Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/NationalHeraldNewDelhi23Dec1985/National%20Herald%20New%20Delhi_23%20Dec%201985#page/n0/mode/1up |title=National Herald New Delhi 23 Dec 1985 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1985-12-23 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staying ashore or mooring on the island was not permitted there and ''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' had to tie up alongside the oil tanker ''Maersk Ascension'' which is permanently anchored off the island&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Samir |last=Pal |title=''Trishna'' yacht is close to midway |page=24 |date=15 February 1996 |work=The Hindustan Times |location = India }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The sail thereafter till the [[Caribbean Sea]] was largely calm. The winds remained predominantly South-Easterly. The first port of call on the continent of [[South America]] was at the coastal town of [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Trishna' heading for Natal |page= |date=20 December 1985 |work=Free Press Journal |location=Bombay, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/FreePressJournali20Dec1985/Free%20Press%20Journali_20%20Dec%201985#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Free Press Journali 20 Dec 1985 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1985-12-20 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew celebrated the New Year of 1986 there with their [[Brazilian Navy]] hosts. From there, the boat sailed along the coast and then up the [[Pará River|Para River]] to the port of [[Belem]]. ''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' had to sail upstream on this tributary of the [[Amazon River]] for 70 nautical miles against strong currents.

The next halt was at the port of [[Paramaribo]], [[Suriname]]. The country has a large East Indian origin population and programs in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] were broadcast by the local radio station. It was a short hop from there to [[Georgetown, Guyana]]. The crew received an enthusiastic reception from the large Indian-origin population here. The [[Guyana Defence Force]] arranged a visit to the [[Kaieteur Falls]] by air during the short stay there. ''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' then proceeded to the Caribbean port of [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] for the first crew change of the voyage. Capt R. Bassi was replaced by Lt. Navin Ahuja.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dom |last=Moraes |title=The Travellers on Trishna |page=6 |date=March 1987 |work=Imprint |location=Bombay, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/ImprintMar1987/Imprint_Mar%201987#page/n1/mode/2up |title=Imprint Mar 1987 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trinidad to Panama City===

The boat then sailed to [[Bridgetown]], [[Barbados]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Round the world' Indians make Bajan port-of-call |page=2 |date=9 February 1986 |work=Sunday Sun |location=Barbados}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then to [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. From there the boat crossed the [[Panama Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/SpillwayDelCanalDePanama11Apr1986/Spillway%20del%20Canal%20de%20Panama_11%20Apr%201986#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Spillway Del Canal De Panama 11 Apr 1986 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1986-04-11 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Panama City]], the boat was taken out of the water and overhauled at the local US Naval Base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Trishna" enters Pacific |page= |date=2 March 1986 |work=Tribune |location=Chandigarh, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TribuneChandigarh02Mar1986/Tribune%20Chandigarh_02%20Mar%201986#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Tribune Chandigarh 02 Mar 1986 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1986-03-02 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor repairs were carried out, barnacles removed and the hull was given a fresh coat of anti-fouling paint by the crew.

===Panama City to Auckland===

The voyage in the northern [[Pacific Ocean]] was relatively calm. With good winds ''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' sailed the 3,200 nautical miles – from [[Galapagos]] to [[Marquesas Islands]] non-stop in 23 days. This was her fastest passage so far.

''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' halted at [[Tahiti]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Indian expedition departs for Tahiti |page= |date=9 April 1986 |work=Jansatta |location=New Delhi, India }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/JansattaNewDelhi09Apr1986/Jansatta%20New%20Delhi_09%20Apr%201986#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Jansatta New Delhi 09 Apr 1986 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1986-04-09 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then onward to [[Raratonga]] and [[Suva]], [[Fiji]]. The weather remained adverse on the leg from [[Fiji]] to [[Auckland]]. Winter had already set in the Southern Hemisphere by this time and the sail was extremely punishing for the crew in the wet and cold conditions.

''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' again had a perilous encounter with some whales between [[Raratonga]] and [[Fiji]]. On three occasions whales came within 10 to 15 meters of the yacht, dived underneath and swam nearby flipping their huge tails&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=R Madhav |last=Rau |title=Near the end |page= |date=28 December 1986 |work=Newstime Weekend |location=Hyderabad, India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auckland to Sydney===

One of the most difficult legs of the voyage was the passage from [[Auckland]] to [[Sydney]] across the [[Tasman Sea]]. The leg was sailed from 03 to 17 Aug 1986. ''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' was hit by gales continuously for five days. The sails were ripped off and for the first time in the expedition, the ‘hove-to’ drill was carried out to ensure that the boat did not suffer major damages. The same storm meanwhile struck [[Sydney]], causing the worst inundation of the city in the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/sevwx/facts/ecl.shtml |title=BoM NSW - East Coast Lows |publisher=Bom.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sydney to Bombay===

The leg [[Sydney]] - [[Brisbane]] - [[Cairns]] - [[Thursday Island]] continued in rough weather, as predicted during the winter months. The voyage was difficult, though spectacular, owing to the sail along the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. Navigation was critical while sailing through the numerous reefs and on one occasion the boat ran aground on a moving sandbar. Fortunately there was no damage though the crew had to wait till the next high tide to sail the boat off. The sail through [[Torres Straits]] again caused anxious moments as the Strait is only about a mile wide and it was a challenge navigating through this narrow passage. From [[Thursday Island]] to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] was a pleasant sail and the crew finally got some respite from adverse weather conditions. This gave the crew opportunity to work on the communication equipment to re-establish radio communications with India through the [[Amateur radio operator|HAM]] network. Since rounding the [[Cape of Good Hope]], there had been no direct communication between the boat and India. Maj SN Mathur was an expert [[Amateur radio operator|HAM]] operator and he soon established a regular link with India.

''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' left [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], North Australia on 13 October 1986 for [[Kupang]], [[Timor]]. From there the boat sailed to [[Waingapu]] in [[Sumba]] and then to [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]]. Good ‘following’ winds helped ''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' reach [[Bali]] on 22 October 1986. [[Bali]] has many [[Hindu temples]] and the crew arrived during one of the main [[Hindu]] festivals, [[Diwali]], the festival of lights. This was the third [[Diwali]] celebrated by the crew away from home.

The yacht set sail from [[Bali]] on 2 November 1986, reaching [[Jakarta]] on 9 November; then via [[Singapore]] and [[Penang]], ''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' made its first landfall on Indian shores at [[Campbell Bay (Great Nicobar)|Campbell Bay]], [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]] on 10 December 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trishna returns to rousing welcome |page= |date=11 December 1986 |work=Daily |location=Bombay, India }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/DailyBombay11Dec1986/Daily%20Bombay_11%20Dec%201986#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Daily Bombay 11 Dec 1986 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1986-12-11 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a momentous occasion and was celebrated with gusto with the whole crew present on the occasion. Maj KS Rao, the Skipper, also received his long delayed promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel here.

The home run via [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]] was uneventful.

''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' received an enthusiastic welcome at the [[Gateway of India]], [[Mumbai]] on her arrival there on 10 January 1987 where she was received by General [[Krishnaswamy Sundarji]], the [[Chief of the Army Staff (India)]] accompanied by a large gathering of sailors, Service officers, friends and relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trishna home to hero's welcome |page= |date=11 January 1987 |work=Indian Express |location=Bombay, India }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/IndianExpressBombayl11Jan1987/Indian%20Express%20Bombayl_11%20Jan%201987#page/n0/mode/2up |title=Indian Express Bombayl 11 Jan 1987 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1987-01-11 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten officers of the [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers]] in a sailboat girdled the globe – 30,000 nautical miles – in less than 16 months creating [[Indian maritime history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/IndianExpressBombayl11Jan1987/Indian%20Express%20Bombayl_11%20Jan%201987#page/n0/mode/2up |title=Indian Express Bombayl 11 Jan 1987 |publisher=Archive.org |date=1987-01-11 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the first Indians to circumnavigate the globe on ''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' - in [[Sanskrit]] the name means to fulfill their ‘thirst’ of sailing around the world.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Honours and awards==
''[[Trishna (yacht)|Trishna]]'' was given the singular honour of thereafter being transported to [[New Delhi]] and took part on a tableau during the [[Republic Day Parade]], 1987.&lt;ref name="gupta1987"/&gt; This in itself was a herculean effort as the boat had reached Mumbai on 10 Jan 1987 itself and to participate in the [[Republic Day Parade]] on 26th, the boat had to be transported to New Delhi, the tableau to be fabricated to the exacting standards of the [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence]] and cleared by their internal committee well before the rehearsals commenced. It seemed an impossible task, but with the concerted efforts of all those involved, the [[Indian Railways]] provided the carriage, [[Naval Dockyard]] Mumbai fabricated the boat cradle overnight on the railway carriage and then again the Railways moved it at express speed, literally, to New Delhi. The [[Bengal Engineer Group]], [[Roorkee]] sent their fabrication team and completed the fabrication work at [[Vijay Chowk]] itself since the boat with its 54&amp;nbsp;ft high mast could not be transported anywhere else in the capital.

== Etymology ==
The genus name ''Ginkgo'' is regarded as a misspelling of the Japanese ''gin kyo'', "silver apricot",&lt;ref name=Coom94&gt;{{Citation |last=Coombes |first=Allen J. |year=1994 |title=Dictionary of Plant Names |publication-place=London |publisher=Hamlyn Books |isbn=978-0-600-58187-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is derived from the Chinese {{lang|zh|銀杏|Yin Xing}} used in Chinese [[herbalism]] literature such as ''Shaoxing Bencao'' ({{lang|zh|紹興本草}}) and [[Compendium of Materia Medica|''Compendium of Materia Medica'']].

[[Engelbert Kaempfer]] first introduced the spelling ''ginkgo'' in his book ''Amoenitatum Exoticarum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=On Engelbert Kaempfer's "Ginkgo"|author=Wolfgang Michel |year=2011 |origyear=2005 |url=http://catalog.lib.kyushu-u.ac.jp/handle/2324/2898/Ginkgo_biloba2_revised_2011.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104137/http://catalog.lib.kyushu-u.ac.jp/handle/2324/2898/Ginkgo_biloba2_revised_2011.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered that he may have misspelled "Ginkjo" as "Ginkgo". This misspelling was included by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his book ''Mantissa plantarum II'' and has become the name of the tree's genus.

Since the spelling may be confusing to pronounce, ginkgo is sometimes purposefully misspelled as "gingko".

==Description==
[[File:Ginkgo biloba JPG1a.jpg|thumb|''Ginkgo biloba'' in [[Tournai]], [[Belgium]]]]
Ginkgos are large trees, normally reaching a height of {{convert|20|–|35|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with some specimens in China being over {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The tree has an angular [[Crown (botany)|crown]] and long, somewhat erratic branches, and is usually deep rooted and resistant to wind and snow damage. Young trees are often tall and slender, and sparsely branched; the crown becomes broader as the tree ages. During autumn, the leaves turn a bright yellow, then fall, sometimes within a short space of time (one to 15&amp;nbsp;days). A combination of resistance to disease, insect-resistant wood and the ability to form [[aerial root]]s and sprouts makes ginkgos long-lived, with some specimens claimed to be more than 2,500&amp;nbsp;years old.

[[File:Ginkgo biloba MHNT.BOT.2010.13.1.jpg|thumb|''Ginkgo biloba'' cross section of tree trunk (source: [[Muséum de Toulouse]])]]
Ginkgo is a relatively shade-intolerant species that (at least in cultivation) grows best in environments that are well-watered and well-drained. The species shows a preference for disturbed sites; in the "semiwild" stands at Tian Mu Shan, many specimens are found along stream banks, rocky slopes, and cliff edges.  Accordingly, ginkgo retains a prodigious capacity for vegetative growth. It is capable of sprouting from embedded buds near the base of the trunk ([[lignotuber]]s, or basal chi chi) in response to disturbances, such as soil erosion. Old individuals are also capable of producing aerial roots on the undersides of large branches in response to disturbances such as crown damage; these roots can lead to successful clonal reproduction upon contacting the soil. These strategies are evidently important in the persistence of ginkgo; in a survey of the "semiwild" stands remaining in [[Tianmu Mountain|Tianmushan]], 40% of the specimens surveyed were multistemmed, and few saplings were present.&lt;ref name=royer&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Dana L. |last1=Royer |first2=Leo J. |last2=Hickey |first3=Scott L. |last3=Wing|year=2003 |title=Ecological conservatism in the 'living fossil' ''Ginkgo'' |journal=Paleobiology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=84–104 |doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2003)029&lt;0084:ECITLF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=0094-8373}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86–87}}

===Phytochemicals===
Extracts of ginkgo leaves contain [[phenolic acids]], [[proanthocyanidins]], [[flavonoid]] [[glycoside]]s, such as [[myricetin]], [[kaempferol]], [[isorhamnetin]] and [[quercetin]], and the [[terpene]] trilactones, [[ginkgolide]]s and [[bilobalide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Chromatography A |year=2002 |volume=967 |issue=1 |pages=21–55 |title=Chemical analysis of Ginkgo biloba leaves and extracts |vauthors=van Beek TA |doi=10.1016/S0021-9673(02)00172-3 |pmid=12219929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vb2"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Chromatogr A |year=2009 |volume=1216 |issue=11 |pages=2002–2032 |doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2009.01.013 |pmid=19195661 |title=Chemical analysis and quality control of Ginkgo biloba leaves, extracts, and phytopharmaceuticals |vauthors=van Beek TA, Montoro P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaves also contain unique ginkgo [[biflavone]]s, as well as [[alkylphenol]]s and [[polyprenols]].&lt;ref name=vb2/&gt;

===Branches===
Ginkgo branches grow in length by growth of shoots with regularly spaced leaves, as seen on most trees. From the [[axil]]s of these leaves, "spur shoots" (also known as short shoots) develop on second-year growth. Short shoots have very short [[Internode (botany)|internode]]s (so they may grow only one or two centimeters in several years) and their leaves are usually unlobed. They are short and knobby, and are arranged regularly on the branches except on first-year growth. Because of the short internodes, leaves appear to be clustered at the tips of short shoots, and reproductive structures are formed only on them (see pictures below – seeds and leaves are visible on short shoots). In ginkgos, as in other plants that possess them, short shoots allow the formation of new leaves in the older parts of the crown. After a number of years, a short shoot may change into a long (ordinary) shoot, or vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Leaves===
[[File:Ginkgo Biloba Leaves - Black Background.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Ginkgo leaves in summer]]
[[File:GinkgoLeaves.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Ginkgo leaves in [[autumn]]]]
The [[leaf|leaves]] are unique among seed plants, being fan-shaped with veins radiating out into the leaf blade, sometimes bifurcating (splitting), but never [[anastomosis|anastomosing]] to form a network.&lt;ref name="More on Morphology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/seedplants/ginkgoales/ginkgomm.html |title=More on Morphology of the Ginkgoales |website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two veins enter the leaf blade at the base and fork repeatedly in two; this is known as dichotomous venation. The leaves are usually {{convert|5|–|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}, but sometimes up to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The old popular name "maidenhair tree" is because the leaves resemble some of the pinnae of the maidenhair fern, ''[[Adiantum capillus-veneris]]''. Ginkgos are prized for their autumn foliage, which is a deep [[Saffron (color)|saffron yellow]].

Leaves of long shoots are usually notched or lobed, but only from the outer surface, between the veins. They are borne both on the more rapidly growing branch tips, where they are alternate and spaced out, and also on the short, stubby spur shoots, where they are clustered at the tips. Leaves are green both on the top and bottom&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bio.brandeis.edu/fieldbio/emmae24/Ginkgoaceae/ginkgo.html |title=Ginkgo Tree |website=www.bio.brandeis.edu |access-date=18 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have stomata on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://prezi.com/clwhmur-nprv/ginkgo-tree/ |title=Ginkgo Tree |website=prezi.com |access-date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
Ginkgos are [[Dioecy#In botany|dioecious]], with separate [[sexes]], some trees being [[female]] and others being [[male]]. Male plants produce small [[conifer cone|pollen cones]] with [[sporophyll]]s, each bearing two [[microsporangium|microsporangia]] spirally arranged around a central axis.

Female plants do not produce cones. Two [[ovule]]s are formed at the end of a stalk, and after [[pollination]], one or both develop into seeds. The seed is 1.5–2&amp;nbsp;cm long. Its fleshy outer layer (the [[sarcotesta]]) is light yellow-brown, soft, and [[fruit]]-like. It is attractive in appearance, but contains [[butyric acid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Raven | first=Peter H. | author2=Ray F. Evert; Susan E.

The fertilization of ginkgo seeds occurs via [[Motility|motile]] sperm, as in cycads, ferns, mosses and algae.

===Distribution and habitat===
Although ''Ginkgo biloba'' and other species of the genus were once widespread throughout the world, its range shrank until by two&amp;nbsp;million years ago, it was restricted to a small area of [[China]].

For centuries, it was thought to be extinct in the wild, but is now known to grow in at least two small areas in [[Zhejiang]] province in eastern China, in the [[Tianmu Mountain|Tianmushan]] Reserve. However, high [[genetics|genetic uniformity]] exists among ginkgo trees from these areas, arguing against a natural origin of these populations and suggesting the ginkgo trees in these areas may have been planted and preserved by Chinese monks over a period of about 1,000&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="Shen et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shen |first1=L |last2=Chen |first2=X-Y |last3=Zhang |first3=X |last4=Li |first4=Y-Y |last5=Fu |first5=C-X |last6=Qiu |first6=Y-X |title=Genetic variation of Ginkgo biloba L.

Where it occurs in the wild, it is found infrequently in deciduous forests and valleys on acidic [[loess]] (i.e. fine, silty soil) with good drainage. The soil it inhabits is typically in the pH range of 5.0 to 5.5.&lt;ref name=florachina&gt;{{Cite book| last=Fu| first=Liguo; Li, Nan; Mill, Robert R. | contribution =Ginkgo biloba| year=1999| title=Flora of China| editor-last=Wu| editor-first=Z.

===Taxonomy===
The relationship of ginkgo to other plant groups remains uncertain. It has been placed loosely in the divisions [[Spermatophyte|Spermatophyta]] and [[Pinophyta]], but no consensus has been reached. Since its seeds are not protected by an [[ovary (plants)|ovary]] wall, it can morphologically be considered a [[gymnosperm]]. The apricot-like structures produced by female ginkgo trees are technically not [[fruit]]s, but are seeds that have a shell consisting of a soft and fleshy section (the [[sarcotesta]]), and a hard section (the [[sclerotesta]]). The sarcotesta has a strong smell that most people find unpleasant.

The ginkgo is classified in its own [[Division (botany)|division]], the Ginkgophyta, comprising the single class Ginkgoopsida, order Ginkgoales, family [[Ginkgoaceae]], genus ''[[Ginkgo]]'' and is the only [[Extant taxon|extant species]] within this group. It is one of the best-known examples of a [[living fossil]], because Ginkgoales other than ''G. biloba'' are not known from the fossil record after the [[Pliocene]].&lt;ref name=ZhouZheng&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhou |first1=Zhiyan |last2=Zheng |first2=Shaolin |title=Palaeobiology: The missing link in Ginkgo evolution |journal=Nature |volume=423 |issue=6942 |pages=821–822 |year=2003 |pmid=12815417 |doi=10.1038/423821a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucmp"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[File:Baiera.jpg|thumb|A digital recreation of ''Baiera'' made from diverse images of fossils and academic descriptions]]
The ginkgo is a [[living fossil]], with fossils recognisably related to modern ginkgo from the [[Permian]], dating back 270&amp;nbsp;million years. The most plausible ancestral group for the order Ginkgoales is the [[Pteridospermatophyta]], also known as the "seed ferns"; specifically the order [[Peltaspermales]]. The closest living relatives of the [[clade]] are the [[cycads]],&lt;ref name=royer/&gt;{{rp|84}} which share with the extant ''G. biloba'' the characteristic of [[Motility|motile]] sperm.

Fossil plants with [[Leaf|leaves]] that have more than four [[Veinlets|veins]] per segment have customarily been assigned to the taxon ''Ginkgo'', while the taxon ''[[Baiera]]'' is used to classify those with fewer than four veins per segment. ''[[Sphenobaiera]]'' has been used for plants with a broadly wedge-shaped leaf that lacks a distinct leaf stem.
 
===Rise and decline===
[[File:Ginkgo biloba MacAbee BC.jpg|right|thumb|''Ginkgo biloba'' leaf from the [[Eocene]] epoch from the [[McAbee Fossil Beds|McAbee fossil beds]], [[British Columbia|BC]], Canada.]]
Fossils attributable to the genus ''Ginkgo'' first appeared in the [[Early Jurassic]]. One of the earliest fossils ascribed to the Ginkgophyta is ''[[Trichopitys]]'', distinguished by having multiple-forked leaves with cylindrical (not flattened), thread-like ultimate divisions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The genus ginko diversified and spread throughout [[Laurasia]] during the middle [[Jurassic]] and [[Early Cretaceous]].

The Ginkgophyta declined in diversity as the Cretaceous progressed, and by the [[Paleocene]], ''[[Ginkgo adiantoides]]'' was the only ''Ginkgo'' species left in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], while a markedly different (and poorly documented) form persisted in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Along with that of ferns, cycads, and cycadeoids, the species diversity in the genus ''Ginkgo'' drops through the Cretaceous, at the same time the flowering plants were on the rise; this supports the hypothesis that, over time, flowering plants with better adaptations to disturbance displaced ''Ginkgo'' and its associates.&lt;ref name=royer/&gt;{{rp|93}}

At the end of the [[Pliocene]], ''Ginkgo'' fossils disappeared from the fossil record everywhere except in a small area of [[South Central China|central China]], where the modern species survived.

===Limited number of species===
[[File:Fossil Plant Ginkgo.jpg|thumb|right|Fossil ''Ginkgo'' leaves from a [[Jurassic]] period [[geological formation|formation]] in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], UK]]
It is doubtful whether the Northern Hemisphere fossil species of ''Ginkgo'' can be reliably distinguished. Given the slow pace of evolution and morphological similarity between members of the genus, there may have been only one or two species existing in the Northern Hemisphere through the entirety of the [[Cenozoic]]: present-day ''G. biloba'' (including ''G. adiantoides'') and ''[[Ginkgo gardneri|G. gardneri]]'' from the [[Paleocene]] of [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=royer/&gt;{{rp|85}}

At least morphologically, ''G. gardneri'' and the Southern Hemisphere species are the only known post-Jurassic taxa that can be unequivocally recognised. The remainder may have been [[ecotypes]] or [[subspecies]]. The implications would be that ''G. biloba'' had occurred over an extremely wide range, had remarkable genetic flexibility and, though [[evolution|evolving]] genetically, never showed much [[speciation]].

While it may seem improbable that a single species may exist as a contiguous entity for many millions of years, many of the ginkgo's life-history parameters fit: Extreme longevity; slow reproduction rate; (in Cenozoic and later times) a wide, apparently contiguous, but steadily contracting distribution; and (as far as can be demonstrated from the fossil record) extreme ecological conservatism (restriction to disturbed streamside environments).&lt;ref name=royer/&gt;{{rp|91}}

===Adaption to a single environment===
Given the slow rate of evolution of the genus, ''ginkgo'' possibly represents a pre-[[angiosperm]] strategy for survival in disturbed streamside environments. Ginkgo evolved in an era before flowering plants, when [[fern]]s, [[cycad]]s, and [[Bennettitales|cycadeoids]] dominated disturbed streamside environments, forming low, open, shrubby canopies. ''Ginkgo''s large seeds and habit of "bolting" – growing to a height of 10&amp;nbsp;meters before elongating its side branches – may be adaptions to such an environment.

Modern-day ''G. biloba'' grows best in environments that are well-watered and drained,&lt;ref name=royer/&gt;{{rp|87}} and the extremely similar fossil ''Ginkgo'' favored similar environments: The sediment record at the majority of fossil ''ginkgo'' localities indicates it grew primarily in [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbed environments]], along streams and levees.&lt;ref name=royer/&gt; ''ginkgo'', therefore, presents an "ecological paradox" because while it possesses some favorable traits for living in disturbed environments (clonal reproduction) many of its other life-history traits are the opposite of those exhibited by modern plants that thrive in disturbed settings (slow growth, large seed size, late reproductive maturity).&lt;ref name=royer/&gt;{{rp|92}}

===Naming===
The species was initially described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1771, the [[Species name|specific epithet]] ''biloba'' derived from the [[Latin]] ''bis'', "two" and ''loba'', "lobed", referring to the shape of the leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|page = 883| isbn=978-0-304-52257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two names for the species recognise the botanist [[Richard Salisbury]], a placement by Nelson as ''Pterophyllus salisburiensis''&lt;!-- !? --&gt; and the earlier ''Salisburia adiantifolia'' proposed by [[James Edward Smith]]. The epithet of the latter may have been intended to denote a characteristic resembling ''[[Adiantum]]'', the genus of maidenhair ferns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imaginatorium.org/sano/ginkgo2.htm|title=Ginkgo – origins|last=Chandler|first=Brian|year=2000|website=Ginkgo pages|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific name ''Ginkgo'' is the result of a spelling error that occurred three centuries ago. ''[[Kanji]]'' typically have multiple pronunciations in Japanese, and the characters 銀杏 used for ''ginnan'' can also be pronounced ''ginkyō''. [[Engelbert Kaempfer]], the first [[Western world|Westerner]] to investigate the species in 1690, wrote down this pronunciation in the notes that he later used for the ''Amoenitates Exoticae'' (1712) with the "awkward" spelling "ginkgo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xp5Zy0O01I0C |author=Engelbert Kaempfer |title=Amoenitates exoticae politico-physico-medicae |date=1721 |publisher=Meyer |location=Lengoviae |language=Latin }}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be a simple error of Kaempfer; taking his spelling of other Japanese words containing the syllable "kyō" into account, a more precise [[Romanization of Japanese|romanization]] following his writing habits would have been "ginkio" or "ginkjo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Michel |first=Wolfgang |year=2011 |orig-year=2005 |title=On Engelbert Kaempfer's 'Ginkgo' |publisher=Kyushu University |url=https://catalog.lib.kyushu-u.ac.jp/opac_download_md/2898/Ginkgo_biloba2_revised_2011.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linné, who relied on Kaempfer when dealing with Japanese plants, adopted the spelling given in Kaempfer's "Flora Japonica" (''Amoenitates Exoticae'', p.&amp;nbsp;811).

Despite its complicated spelling, which is due to an exceptionally complicated etymology including a transcription error, "ginkgo" is usually pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|ŋ|k|oʊ}},&lt;ref name =AHD/&gt; which has given rise to the common other spelling "gingko". The [[spelling pronunciation]] {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|ŋ|k|g|oʊ}} is also documented in some dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Oxford Dictionaries|ginkgo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|ginkgo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The older Chinese name for this plant is 銀果, meaning "silver fruit", pronounced ''yínguǒ'' in Mandarin or ''Ngan-gwo'' in Cantonese. The most usual names today are 白果 (''bái guǒ''), meaning "white fruit", and {{lang|zh|銀杏}} (''yínxìng''), meaning "silver [[apricot]]". The former name was [[loanword|borrowed]] directly in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] as ''bạch quả''. The latter name was borrowed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ぎんなん ''(ginnan)'' and [[Korean language|Korean]] 은행 ''(eunhaeng)'', when the tree itself was introduced from China.

==Uses==
===Horticulture===
Ginkgos are popular subjects for growing as ''[[penjing]]'' and ''[[bonsai]]'';&lt;ref name="Ma-Ke_Ginkgo biloba"&gt;{{cite web | first=Mark | last=D'Cruz | title=Ma-Ke Bonsai Care Guide for Ginkgo biloba | publisher=Ma-Ke Bonsai | url=http://guide.makebonsai.com/bonsailink.asp?quicklink=5022&amp;name=Ginkgo_biloba | accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they can be kept artificially small and tended over centuries. Furthermore, the trees are easy to propagate from seed.

===Cooking===
[[File:Ginkgo Seed.JPG|thumb|Ginkgo seeds with sarcotesta removed]]
[[File:Ginkgo and coconut dessert.jpg|thumb|Ginkgo seeds served with boiled coconut flesh as a dessert in Thailand]]
The nut-like [[gametophyte]]s inside the seeds are particularly esteemed in Asia, and are a traditional [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese food]]. Ginkgo nuts are used in ''[[congee]]'', and are often served at special occasions such as weddings and the [[Chinese New Year]] (as part of the vegetarian dish called [[Buddha's delight]]). In Chinese culture, they are believed to have health benefits; some also consider them to have [[aphrodisiac]] qualities. Japanese cooks add ginkgo seeds (called ''ginnan'') to dishes such as ''[[chawanmushi]]'', and cooked seeds are often eaten along with other dishes.

When eaten in large quantities or over a long period, the gametophyte (meat) of the seed can cause poisoning by [[Ginkgotoxin|4'-O-methylpyridoxine]] (MPN). MPN is heat-stable and not destroyed by cooking.&lt;ref name="pediatrics.aappublications.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ginkgo seed poisoning |website= PEDIATRICS Vol. 109 No |date= 2 February 2002 |pages= 325–327 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/109/2/325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have demonstrated the convulsions caused by MPN can be prevented or treated successfully with [[pyridoxine]] (vitamin B6).

Some people are sensitive to the chemicals in the [[sarcotesta]], the outer fleshy coating. These people should handle the seeds with care when preparing the seeds for consumption, wearing disposable gloves. The symptoms are allergic contact [[dermatitis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lepoittevin |first1=J. -P. |last2=Benezra |first2=C. |last3=Asakawa |first3=Y. |title=Allergic contact dermatitis to Ginkgo biloba L.: relationship with urushiol |journal=Archives of Dermatological Research |volume=281 |issue=4 |pages=227–30 |year=1989 |pmid=2774654 |doi=10.1007/BF00431055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid14979519&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schötz |first1=Karl |title=Quantification of allergenic urushiols in extracts ofGinkgo biloba leaves, in simple one-step extracts and refined manufactured material(EGb 761) |journal=Phytochemical Analysis |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2004 |pmid=14979519 |doi=10.1002/pca.733}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[blister]]s similar to that caused by contact with [[poison ivy]].

===Traditional medicine===
The first use as a medicine is recorded in the late 15th century in China; among western countries, its first registered medicinal use was in Germany in 1965. Despite use, controlled studies do not support the extract's efficacy for most of the indicated conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products |title=Assessment report on Ginkgo biloba L., folium |url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Herbal_-_HMPC_assessment_report/2014/02/WC500161208.pdf |website=European Medicines Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adverse effects and toxicity===
The use of ''Ginkgo biloba'' leaf extracts may have undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking [[anticoagulant]]s such as [[aspirin]] or [[warfarin]], although studies have found ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or [[pharmacodynamics]] of [[warfarin]] in healthy subjects.&lt;ref name="warfarin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiang X, Williams KM, Liauw WS, Ammit AJ, Roufogalis BD, Duke CC, Day RO, McLachlan AJ |title=Effect of ginkgo and ginger on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin in healthy subjects |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=425–432 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15801937 |pmc=1884814 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2005.02322.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;amp;issn=0306-5251&amp;amp;date=2005&amp;amp;volume=59&amp;amp;issue=4&amp;amp;spage=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nih&gt;{{cite web| title=MedlinePlus Herbs and Supplements: Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.)| accessdate=10 April 2008| publisher=National Institutes of Health| url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-ginkgo.html#Interactions| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517045825/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-ginkgo.html |archivedate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
[[File:Gingko biloba JPG2b.jpg|thumb|''Ginkgo biloba'' in [[Morlanwelz-Mariemont]] Park, [[Belgium]]]]
Ginkgo has long been cultivated in China; some planted trees at temples are believed to be over 1,500&amp;nbsp;years old. The first record of Europeans encountering it is in 1690 in [[Japanese garden|Japanese temple gardens]], where the tree was seen by the German botanist [[Engelbert Kaempfer]]. Because of its status in [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]], the ginkgo is also widely planted in Korea and parts of Japan; in both areas, some naturalization has occurred, with ginkgos seeding into natural forests.

In some areas, most intentionally planted ginkgos are male [[cultivar]]s grafted onto plants propagated from seed, because the male trees will not produce the malodorous seeds. The popular cultivar ‘Autumn Gold’ is a clone of a male plant.

The disadvantage of male ''Ginkgo biloba'' trees is that they are highly allergenic. They have an [[OPALS (Ogren Plant Allergy Scale)|OPALS allergy scale]] rating of 7 (out of 10), whereas female trees, which can produce no [[pollen]], have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 2.&lt;ref name=Ogren2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogren|first=Thomas Leo|title=Allergy-Free Gardening|date=2000|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-58008-166-5|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female cultivars include ‘Liberty Splendor’, ‘Santa Cruz’, and ‘Golden Girl’, the latter so named because of the striking yellow color of its leaves in the fall; all female cultivars release zero pollen.&lt;ref name=Ogren2000/&gt;

Many cultivars are listed in the literature in the [[UK]], of which the compact ‘Troll’ has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]’s [[Award of Garden Merit]].&lt;ref name = RHSPF&gt;{{cite web

==Society and culture==
[[File:PrefSymbol-Tokyo.svg|thumb|upright|Symbol of [[Tokyo]] prefecture, representing a ginkgo leaf.]]
The ginkgo leaf is the symbol of the [[Urasenke]] school of [[Japanese tea ceremony]]. The tree is the official tree of the Japanese capital of [[Tokyo]], and the symbol of Tokyo is a ginkgo leaf.

===Hiroshima===
{{further information|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
Extreme examples of the ginkgo's tenacity may be seen in [[Hiroshima]], Japan, where six trees growing between {{convert|1–2|km}} from the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Hiroshima|1945 atom bomb explosion]] were among the few living things in the area to survive the blast. Although almost all other plants (and animals) in the area were killed, the ginkgos, though charred, survived and were soon healthy again, among other ''[[hibakujumoku]]'' (trees that survived the blast).

The six trees are still alive: They are marked with signs at {{nihongo|Housenbou|報専坊}} temple (planted in 1850), [[Shukkei-en]] (planted about 1740), Jōsei-ji (planted 1900), at the former site of Senda Elementary School near Miyukibashi, at the [[Myōjin-shō|Myōjōin temple]], and an [[Edo period]]-cutting at [[Anraku-ji (Hiroshima)|Anraku-ji]] temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A-bombed Ginkgo trees in Hiroshima, Japan|url=http://kwanten.home.xs4all.nl/hiroshima.htm|website=The Ginkgo Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1000-year-old ginkgo at Tsurugaoka Hachimangū ===
[[File:Ginkgo-reborn-2.jpg|thumb|upright|The stump of the ancient fallen ginkgo which has produced leaves in recent years]]
The ginkgo tree that had stood next to [[Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū|Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū's]] stone stairway approximately from the [[Shinto shrine|Shinto shrine's]] foundation in 1063, and which appears in almost every old depiction of the shrine, was completely uprooted and irreparably damaged on March 10, 2010.&lt;ref name=GreatGinkgo&gt;{{cite web |title=10-The Great Ginkgo大銀杏 |url=http://www.tsurugaoka-hachimangu.jp/precinct_guide/the_great_ginkgo.html |website=Tsurugaoka Hachimangu |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an expert who analyzed the tree, the fall was likely due to rot.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Later, both the stump of the severed tree and a replanted section of the trunk sprouted leaves. The shrine is in the city of [[Kamakura]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]].

The tree was nicknamed ''kakure-ichō'' (hiding ginkgo), deriving from an [[Edo period]] [[urban legend]] which told of the assassination of [[Minamoto no Sanetomo]] by his nephew, [[Kugyō (priest)|Kugyō]], who had been hiding behind the tree.&lt;ref name=GreatGinkgo/&gt;

==Environmental issues==
{{main|List of environmental issues}}
Theories like the [[World-systems theory|world-system theory]] and the [[Gaia hypothesis]] focus on the inter-dependency aspect of environmental and economic issues. Among the most evident environmental problems are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/15-current-environmental-problems.php|title=15 Current Environmental Problems That Our World is Facing - Conserve Energy Future|first=|last=Rinkesh|date=27 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/why-we-need-earth-day-7-most-pressing-environmental-problems-we-need-to-solve/|title=The World's 6 Most Pressing Environmental Issues|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/issues/|title=NRDC - Our Work|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/issue/168/environmental-issues|title=Environmental Issues — Global Issues|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No single issue can be analysed or treate isolated from the others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/issues/global/major-global-issues-diagram-lg.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; For example, habitat loss and climate change adversely affect biodiversity. Deforestation and pollution are direct consequences of overpopulation and both, in turn, affect biodiversity. While overpopulation locally leads to [[rural flight]], this is more than counterbalanced by accelerating [[urbanization]] and urban sprawl.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">'''Intraspecific antagonism''' means a disharmonious or antagonistic interaction between two [[individual]]s of the same [[species]]. As such, it could be a [[sociology|sociological]] term, but was actually coined by [[Alan Rayner]] and [[Norman Kalmer Todd|Norman Todd]] working at [[Exeter University]] in the late 1970s, to characterise a particular kind of [[zone line]] formed between [[wood-rotting fungus|wood-rotting fungal]] [[mycelium|mycelia]]. Intraspecific antagonism is one of the expressions of a phenomenon known as vegetative or somatic incompatibility.&lt;ref name=Worral1997/&gt;

==Fungal individualism==

Zone lines form in [[wood]] for many reasons, including host reactions against [[parasite|parasitic]] encroachment, and inter-specific interactions, but the lines observed by Rayner and Todd when transversely-cut sections of [[Birch bracket|brown-rotted birch]] tree trunk or branch were incubated in plastic bags appeared to be due to a reaction between different individuals of the same species of [[fungus]].&lt;ref name=Rayner1979/&gt;

This was a startling inference at a time when the prevailing orthodoxy within the [[Mycology|mycological]] community was that of the "unit mycelium". This was the theory that when two different individuals of the same species of [[basidiomycete]] wood rotting fungi grew and met within the substratum, they fused, cooperated, and shared nuclei freely.&lt;ref name=Burnett1976/&gt; Rayner and Todd's insight was that basidiomycete fungi individuals do, in most "adult" or [[dikaryon|dikaryotic]] cases anyway, retain their individuality.&lt;ref name=Rayner1977/&gt;

A small stable of postgraduate and postdoctoral students helped elucidate the mechanisms underlying these intermycelial interactions, at [[Exeter University]] (Todd) and the [[University of Bath]] (Rayner), over the next few years.

==Applications of intraspecific antagonism==

[[Image:fungalzoneline.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Zone lines in driftwood'']] Although the attribution of individual status to the mycelia confined by intraspecific zone lines is a comparatively new idea, zone lines themselves have been known since time immemorial. The term [[spalting]] is applied by woodworkers to wood showing strongly-figured zone lines, particularly those cases where the area of "no-man's land" between two antagonistic conspecific mycelia is colonised by another species of fungus. [[Dematiaceous]] hyphomycetes, with their dark-coloured mycelia, produce particularly attractive black zone lines when they colonise the areas occupied by two antagonistic basidiomycete individuals. Spalted wood can be difficult to work, since different individual wood-rotting fungi have different decay efficiencies, and thus produce zones of different softness, and the zone lines themselves are usually unrotted and hard.

Instraspecific antagonism can also sometimes be of assistance in quickly recognising the membership of clones in those fungi, particularly root-rots such as [[Honey fungus|Armillarea]] where individual mycelia may colonise large areas, or more than one tree.

It is even the subject of a recent patent.[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4698305.html]

The '''Audubon Kern River Preserve''' is a [[riparian]] [[nature reserve]] owned by the [[National Audubon Society]] in the [[United States|US]] state of [[California]], near [[Weldon, California|Weldon]] in [[Kern County, California|Kern County]].

The preserve is located in one of the largest contiguous [[riparian forest]]s remaining in the state.&lt;ref name="RSmith"&gt;[http://cei.org/pdf/1366.pdf  Smith, Robert J. Private Conservation Case Study  ''The Kern River Preserve''] December 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|3000|acre|km2|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="kern.audubon.org"&gt;[http://kern.audubon.org/2009-ranch-purchase.htm "80-acres Protected as Pond Ranch becomes part of the Kern River Preserve"]&lt;/ref&gt; preserve provides habitat for rare and Audubon's endangered  birds, one of which is the federally listed endangered southwestern willow flycatcher,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=B094 US Fish and Wildlife Service, Species Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; a subspecies of the [[willow flycatcher]].  The preserve is located within a designated Globally Important Bird Area, a program of the National Audubon Society with its partner BirdLife International to identify and protect critical avian habitats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.audubon.org/iba/ Important Bird Areas in California].&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Fork Kern River, designated a national [[Wild and Scenic River]] since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rivers.gov/wsr-kern.html National Wild and Scenic Rivers Program]&lt;/ref&gt; flows down the South Fork Valley, through the Kern River Preserve and then into [[Lake Isabella]]. The South Fork is the source for irrigation water for agriculture and the rare riparian forests of the valley. The river's upper reaches have populations of [[golden trout]], California's state fish. The golden trout is being reviewed by United States [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] for listing under the [[Endangered Species Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=E083 US Fish and Wildlife Service-Species Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific research studies are conducted at the Kern River Preserve, including the Grinnell Resurvey Project, a 2008-09 resurvey by [[University of California, Berkeley]] students of zoologist [[Joseph Grinnell]]'s 1914 landmark survey of California species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kern.audubon.org/Grinnell.htm  "Audubon assists UC Berkeley in an Historical Zoological Survey"] Aubudon California, Kern River Preserve website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The preserve features a visitor's center, a self-guided nature trail, monthly nature events, monthly volunteer work days and a variety of festivals during the year.

==History==
The Preserve is located on the former cattle ranch of Andrew Brown, which dates to the 1860s. The ranch was bought by The Nature Conservancy in 1979 and the deed transferred to National Audubon Society in 1998.&lt;ref name="krphist"&gt;http://kern.audubon.org/about.htm About the Kern River Preserve&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pioneer Andrew Brown===
Andrew Brown was born in Ireland in 1829, arrived in California in 1852, and eventually settled in Kern County. He operated a general store in Kernville, and expanded into Weldon township with the purchase of a second store and a ranch. Brown raised cattle, sheep, hogs and wheat. He built a flour mill in Weldon and later a sawmill near what is now Wofford Heights. Business success enabled Brown to purchase and trade for other ranch and farm land, and he incorporated all his interests into the A. Brown Company in 1901. Brown was company president until his death in 1909. The Brown family continued operations until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="morgan"&gt;Morgan, Wallace Melvin, ''History of Kern County, California, with biographical sketches of the leading men and women of the county who have been identified with its growth and development from the early days to the present.'' [https://archive.org/details/historyofkerncou00morg] 1914 pp 213-214&lt;/ref&gt;
when the heirs sold the Brown Ranch to the Kern County Land and Cattle Company.

Development of the property was a possibility, however, The Nature Conservancy moved quickly to purchase {{convert|1600|acre|km2}} of the ranch. The purchase was accomplished in 1979 with funds from donors, two of which were [[Getty Oil Company]] and the [[W. M. Keck Foundation]].&lt;ref name="RSmith"/&gt;

===Expansion of the preserve===
The Nature Conservancy acquired adjacent acreage through a program of land trades which swapped pasture land parcels for riparian forest parcels with nearby Sprague Ranch and the Prince Ranch in 1980.  The preserve now bordered the Army Corps of Engineers' (now Sequoia National Forest) South Fork Wildlife Area on the west and the eastern end of [[Lake Isabella]] where the South Fork Kern River enters the reservoir.  In 1981, a fence was constructed to protect the streamside vegetation from grazing cattle.&lt;ref name="RSmith"/&gt;

On March 31, 2005, Audubon California chapter and [[California Department of Fish and Game]] bought {{convert|4358|acre|km2}} of the Sprague Ranch. The purchase was in part to mitigate for the flooding of the South Fork Wildlife Area from Lake Isabella during high water years and resulting loss of willow flycatcher habitat.  A total of {{convert|1640|acre|km2}} was added to the preserve, the remaining {{convert|2718|acre|km2}} of Sprague Ranch went to California Department of Fish and Game. Funding was provided by US Army Corps of Engineers; California Wildlife Conservation Board; and the National Audubon Society from a grant from the [[David and Lucile Packard Foundation|Packard Foundation]]'s Conserving California's Landscape Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kern.audubon.org/sprague.htm#Sprague%20Ranch%20Acquisition Audubon California "Sprague Ranch now part of the Kern River Preserve"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2006, the purchase of {{convert|105|acre|km2}} of the Alexander Ranch that flanks the South Fork Kern River was completed with funds from the Resources Legacy Foundation. The riverfront property has nesting sites of [[vermilion flycatcher]]s, [[yellow warbler]]s, [[Bullock's oriole]]s and southwestern willow flycatcher. The land is in good condition, with ponds of [[duckweed]] and other [[wetland]] plants that harbor several pond turtles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kern.audubon.org/KRP_Friends_newsletter/VOL_10_ISS_1_2006_web.pdf KRP Friends of the Preserve newsletter winter/spring 2006.] pp1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two land acquisitions in 2009: On August 28, the {{convert|26|acre|m2|adj=on}} Vig property was purchased by Audubon,&lt;ref name="krphist"/&gt; and  November 20, the {{convert|80|acre|m2|adj=on}} Pond Ranch sale closed a gap between Fay Ranch Road and Sierra Way Road. The Pond Ranch purchase added one-quarter mile of the South Fork Kern River frontage to the preserve&lt;ref name="kern.audubon.org"/&gt;

===Cattle and conservation===
In addition to real estate purchases, the Audubon California organization continues to work with private land owners in the South Fork Valley on conservation issues.  Bruce Hafenfeld, of the California Cattlemen's Association, operates a family ranch raising commercial calves and cows on both private property and [[public land]]s on a federal grazing allotment. Hafenfeld has entered into a perpetual [[conservation easement]] with the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (formerly Soil Conservation Service) to ensure the property is maintained as a working ranch.  "We developed a management plan for 1.3 acres along the Kern River Preserve, went after a wetland reserve grant, and developed habitat that increased opportunities for species to come onto my land. We were trying to show that we were not a liability, but an asset." Hafenfeld said, speaking at the 2007 Conference of the Riparian Habitat Joint Venture.&lt;ref name="venture"/&gt; The Riparian Habitat Joint Venture is a cooperative conservation agreement between federal, state and private entities modeled after the joint venture projects of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. It was started in 1994 by [[Partners in flight]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tws-west.org/riparian/rhjv.html Point Reyes Bird Observatory fact sheet on Riparian Habitat Joint Venture.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It took eight years, working with multiple agencies, to form the conservation easement for the Hafenfeld Ranch.&lt;ref name="venture"&gt;"Riparian Habitat Conservation and Flood Management in California"

==Flora and fauna==

===South Fork Kern River and Valley===
[[File:Calochortus striatus 8.jpg|thumb|Alkali mariposa lily.]]
The [[South Fork Kern River]] is the heart of the preserve and the South Fork Valley.
The river begins at elevation {{convert|10400|ft|m}} in the [[Inyo National Forest]] at Mulkey Meadows, named after Cyrus Mulkey, sheriff of Inyo County, California from 1871 to 1874.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/place_names_of_the_high_sierra/m.html Farquhar, Francis P.   ''Place Names of the High Sierra (1926)'' ]
 Farquhar's footnote:(Chalfant: ''The Story of Inyo'', 1922, pp, 213, 334.—S.C.B., 1893, I:1, p. 4.)&lt;/ref&gt;
The river flows down the South Fork Valley, through the Audubon Kern River Preserve to Lake Isabella at {{convert|2605|ft|m}} elevation.  The South Fork Valley, only a few miles wide and {{convert|15|mi|km}} in length, is at the southern end of the [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada Mountains]] in northeastern Kern County. Although the valley was the first area settled in the county, it contains the largest contiguous riparian forest still remaining in the state.&lt;ref name="morgan"/&gt; There are several types of riparian forest, the South Fork Valley has the Great Valley Cottonwood Forest, distinguished by a majority of Fremont cottonwood and willow tree species. The understory is dense with wild rose and shade-tolerant Oregon ash. The soils are fine-grained alluvial with annual river flooding that maintains fertility.

The [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]'s Biogeography Lab report describes the distribution  of this type of riparian forest as "Formerly extensive along the major low-gradient (depositional) streams throughout the Great Valley, but [are] now reduced to scattered, isolated remnants or young stands because of flood control, water diversion, agricultural development, and urban expansion..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biogeog.ucsb.edu/projects/gap/data/cnddb/61410.html UCSB Biogeography Lab Gap Project, Great Valley Cottonwood Forest(61419)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rare wildflowers include the [[Calochortus striatus|alkali mariposa lily]]. Listed by [[California Native Plant Society]] as "rare, threatened or endangered in California and elsewhere",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=1307  Taxon report ''Calochortus striatus'', Calflora]&lt;/ref&gt; it has been observed near the South Fork Kern River, as well as the surrounding counties and in the state of Nevada. It is a perennial bulb that blooms in April and May, and is threatened by grazing, trampling, road construction, urbanization and horticultural collecting. Water diversions can also impact this primarily wetland species.&lt;ref&gt;http://northcoastcnps.org/cgi-bin/inv/inventory.cgi/Show?_id=calochortus_striatus CNPS Inventory of rare and endangered plants, ''Calochortus striatus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bird species===
The streamside habitat provides nesting sites for riparian-dependent bird species:  The federally threatened [[western yellow-billed cuckoo]], endangered in California; the [[brown-crested flycatcher]], a cavity-nester;  the [[yellow warbler]], the [[yellow-breasted chat]], and the southwestern willow flycatcher. 
[[File:Southwestern Willow Flycatcher.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Southwestern willow flycatcher&lt;br /&gt;USFWS photo.]]
The federally listed endangered southwestern willow flycatcher has small populations in the preserve and is closely monitored by Audubon volunteers and staff. The US Fish and Wildlife Service designated [[critical habitat]] for the southwestern willow flycatcher which includes {{convert|9.6|mi|km}} of the South Fork Kern River and excludes Hafenfeld Ranch which has the conservation easement in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/2005/05-20144.html USFWS Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designation of Critical Habitat for the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (''Empidonax traillii extimus''); Final Rule]. Section titled Kern Management Unit&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable bird is the [[summer tanager]]. The summer tanager  breeds in lowlands along streams and is known as a ''bee and wasp specialist''. The summer tanager will remove the bee's stinger before ingesting by rubbing the bee on a branch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Summer_Tanager/lifehistory Cornell Lab of Ornithology,All About Birds] ''Summer Tanager''&lt;/ref&gt; The least Bell's vireo is a species that will hopefully reestablish nesting in the South Fork Kern River Valley. It is one of four subspecies of [[Bell's vireo]], which disappeared from California's Central Valley by the 1960s, and has been federally listed as endangered since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=B067  USFWS Species Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; The US Fish and Wildlife Service's 5-year review of least Bell's vireo, dated September 2006, attributes the primary cause of population declines to loss of riparian habitat in California. Another threat listed by the review is from the [[brown-headed cowbird]] which lays its eggs in other birds' nests, called [[brood parasite]]ism. The Southern Sierra Research Station, which conducts research on the Kern River Preserve, has a cowbird eradication program which has reduced the rate of parasitism to  20 percent from  60 to 70 percent (percentage of willow flycatcher nests studied by Southern Sierra Research Station staff).&lt;ref name="RSmith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/five_year_review/doc781.pdf USFWS 5-year Review Least Bell's Vireo]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammals, amphibians, reptiles and insects===
Common mammals include mule deer, coyote, [[woodrat|dusky-footed woodrat]], [[long-tailed weasel]], California ground squirrel, American black bear, and bobcat. Uncommon species include mountain lion and an introduced species of beaver. There are 50 species of mammals&lt;ref&gt;[http://kern.audubon.org/mammals.htm] Mammals on the Kern River Preserve&lt;/ref&gt; found on the Kern River Preserve.

There are three species of amphibians&lt;ref&gt;[http://kern.audubon.org/amphibians.htm] Amphibians of the Kern River Preserve&lt;/ref&gt; and 24 species of reptiles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kern.audubon.org/reptiles.htm] Reptiles of the Kern River Preserve&lt;/ref&gt; including the common [[garter snake]], [[California kingsnake]], several lizard species and the [[western toad|California toad]]. The only venomous snake at the preserve is the [[rattlesnake|Northern Pacific rattlesnake]]. Also found at the preserve is the [[western pond turtle|Pacific pond turtle]], a species of concern in California and listed as endangered in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]].

The South Fork Valley is unique in California, as three of the ten [[floristic provinces]] in the nation meet and overlap here. The floristic provinces are: [[Great Basin Desert]], Mojave Desert, and Californian Province (in which one finds numerous ecotypes: grassland, riparian forest, oak woodland, interior chaparral, mixed conifer, sequoia, red fir, subalpine.) The resulting diversity is evident in the numbers of species: There are 31 species [[dragonfly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kern.audubon.org/dragonflies.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701231925/http://kern.audubon.org/dragonflies.htm |archivedate=2012-07-01 |df= }} Dragonflies on the Kern River Preserve&lt;/ref&gt; of and 53 species of [[butterfly]], including the alkali skipper ([[grass skipper]]) and the rare San Emigdio blue butterfly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kern.audubon.org/SEBLUE.htm] San Emigdio blue butterfly&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;The San Emigdio blue butterfly is a species of concern due to its limited local range consisting of  Southern California from Inyo County south through the [[Mojave Desert]], [[San Joaquin Valley]], [[Bouquet Canyon|Bouquet]] and Mint canyons of [[Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.butterfliesandmoths.org/species?l=1621 Butterflies and Moths of North America]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific research==

===Grinnell Resurvey Project===
Joseph Grinnell was one of the founding directors of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley from 1908 until his death in 1939. Grinnell undertook a biological survey project in 1908, which lasted 30 years and covered more than 700 locations in the state of California. The resulting database has more than 20,000 specimens, 13,000 pages of field notes, and 2,000 photographs.  The Grinnell Survey database is one of the most comprehensive collections of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name="MVZ"&gt;[http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/articles.php?issue=10&amp;article=backtonature ''Berkeley Science Review'' magazine, Issue 10 "Back to Nature-Revisiting the 1914 survey of California Wildlife".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613041630/http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/articles.php?issue=10&amp;article=backtonature |date=2010-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A resurvey of Grinnell's original route was begun by the museum to research, document and model changes in the distribution and habits of animal species in the timespan between the early 1900s and the current century. The Kern River Valley area, called the Whitney transect, was studied in June and September 2008 and in May 2009 by the resurvey teams. The original Grinnell 1911-1914 field notes are online and searchable. (See External links section.) Parts of the resurvey of California are completed, including [[Yosemite National Park]], and show changing trends in wildlife territory and range; some expanding, some contracting and some species moving to higher elevations.&lt;ref name="MVZ"/&gt;

===Other research===
A subspecies of the Pacific (western) pond turtle is the southern Pacific pond turtle (''Actinemys marmorata pallida''). A project for headstarting pond turtle hatchlings on the preserve began in 2006 with grants from the Fish and Wildlife Foundation. As of July 2010, 17 juvenile turtles were released from captivity. This process is known as ''headstarting'',  where hatchlings are raised in captivity until they are large enough to avoid predators and then released to the wild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kern.audubon.org/turtles.htm Southern Pacific Pond Turtle Project, Audubon California]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southern Sierra Research Station, a non-profit organization, conducts research at the preserve on the western yellow-billed cuckoo and southwestern willow flycatcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southernsierraresearch.org/ Southern Sierra Research Station website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist Donald Mitchell from the [[University of Minnesota]] studied migration of hummingbirds at the preserve.  Mitchell is a federally permitted hummingbird bander and has served as Vice President of the Minnesota Ornithologists' Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.umn.edu/county/Winona/news/2009Brochure.pdf.

==Public access and education==
Audubon's Kern River Preserve hosts four festivals annually, monthly nature education programs, and monthly volunteer days. The preserve is open sunrise to sunset all year, including holidays.
 
*In April is the Kern River Valley Bioregions Festival, and has guided hikes, workshops, crafts vendors, musical entertainment and exhibits.
*Held in August is the Kern Valley Hummingbird Celebration, and includes nature walks, workshops on identification of hummingbirds, information on gardening for hummingbirds, and musical entertainment.
*In September the Kern Valley Autumn Nature &amp; Vulture Festival is held, and begins with a "Turkey Vulture Lift Off" and includes [[turkey vulture]] interpretation during the birds departure from their overnight roost between 8:30 and 10 a.m. The festival includes free bird walks, informational booths, interactive exhibits and displays featuring live reptiles, plants and wildlife along with musical entertainment. Activities are scheduled throughout the day.
*Monthly Nature Exploration events are held on the first Saturday of the month from 9 a.m - 11 a.m. Topics vary each month with experts from fields across the spectrum of outdoor adventures.
*Monthly volunteer workdays are held on the third Saturday of the month from 8 a.m - noon (with a summer hiatus in June, July and August). Projects vary each month depending on season. Rewarding projects have included: habitat restoration (riparian, upland and marshland), fence removal, cleanups, participation in the KRP Valley Pride Day team, and trail maintenance.

A '''lava field''', also called a '''lava plain''' or '''lava bed''', is a large expanse of nearly flat-lying [[lava]] flows. Such features are generally composed of highly fluid [[basalt]] lava, and can extend for tens or even hundreds of miles across the underlying terrain. The extent of large lava fields is most readily grasped from the air or in satellite photos, where their typically dark, nearly black color contrasts sharply with the rest of the landscape.

According to the US Geological Survey, [[monogenetic volcanic field]]s are collections of [[cinder cones]], and/or [[Maar]] vents and associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Sometimes a [[stratovolcano]]&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Glossary/VolcanicFields/framework.html|title=Volcanic Fields|accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is at the center of the field, as at the [[San Francisco Volcanic Field]] in Arizona. Monogenetic volcano fields have systematic growth patterns that suggest they represent single magmatic systems in the same way that stratovolcanoes do, but monogenetic volcanoes grow laterally rather than vertically (Wood and Shoan, 1984){{Full citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Detailed mapping indicates that some cinder cones in monogenetic fields (e.g., [[Cima volcanic field]], California, and Timber Mountain Volcanic Field, Nevada) may have had multiple eruptions separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years (Wells, et al., 1989){{Full citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Thus, some monogenetic cones may actually be [[Polygenetic volcanic field|polygenetic]]. This possibility differs from observations of historic eruptions (Wood, 1979){{Full citation needed|date=March 2018}}, and is physically difficult to understand because cinder cone conduits are narrow and must solidify within a few years of eruption. Nonetheless, such multiple eruptions appear to have happened at least twice: Other cinder cones need to be closely reexamined.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

Some of the most ancient geological remnants of basaltic [[plain]]s lie in [[Canada]]'s [[Canadian Shield|Precambrian Shield]]. Eruption of plateau lavas near the [[Coppermine River]] southwest of [[Coronation Gulf]] in the [[Arctic]], built an extensive plateau about 1200 million years ago with an area of about {{convert|170000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, representing a volume of lavas of at least {{convert|500000|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}.  The lavas are thought to have originated from a mantle plume center called the [[Mackenzie hotspot]].{{cn|date=April 2014}}

[[Ant]]s ([[family (biology)|family]] Formicidae in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Hymenoptera]]) are the most species-rich of all [[social insect]]s, with more than 12,000 described [[species]] and many others awaiting description.&lt;ref name="Ward_2007"/&gt; Formicidae is divided into 21 [[subfamily|subfamilies]], of which 17 contain [[Extant taxon|extant]] [[Taxon|taxa]], while four are exclusively [[fossil]].&lt;ref name="AntCat_Formicidae"/&gt; Ants have come to occupy virtually all major terrestrial habitats, with the exception of tundra and cold ever-wet forests. They display a wide range of social behaviors, foraging habits and associations with other organisms, which has generated scientific and public interest.&lt;ref name="Ward_2007"/&gt;

==Clades==
Beginning in the 1990s, molecular ([[DNA sequence]]) data have come to play a central role in attempts to reconstruct the ant "[[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]". [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular phylogenetic]] analyses based on multiple [[nuclear gene]]s have yielded robust results that reinforce some preexisting views but overturn others&amp;nbsp;– and suggest that there has been considerable [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] [[Convergent evolution|convergence]] among some ant lineages. Molecular data provide very strong support for a novel group, the "formicoid [[clade]]", not revealed by previous morphological work. This clade comprises 9&lt;ref name="Brady_et_al_2014"/&gt; of the 16 extant ant subfamilies and about 90% of all described ant species. Formicoids include such widespread and species-rich subfamilies as [[Myrmicinae]], [[Formicinae]] and [[Dolichoderinae]], as well as the [[army ant]]s ([[Dorylinae]]). Non-formicoids comprise five "poneroid" subfamilies ([[Agroecomyrmecinae]], [[Amblyoponinae]], [[Paraponerinae]], [[Ponerinae]], and [[Proceratiinae]]), [[Leptanillinae]], about which little is known, and [[Martialinae]], the most recently discovered subfamily.&lt;ref name="Ward_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuck_et_al._2011"/&gt; Relationships among these remaining seven subfamilies are less well resolved.&lt;ref name="Ward_2007"/&gt; A recent study (2011) places Leptanillinae as a [[sister group]] to all other ants, with Martialinae, the poneroids and formicoids forming a clade.&lt;ref name="Kuck_et_al._2011"/&gt;

==Evolution of ants==
Ants first arose during the [[Cretaceous|mid-Cretaceous]], more than 100 million years ago, associated with the rise of flowering plants and an increase in forest ground litter.&lt;ref name="Wilson_Holldobler_2005"/&gt; The earliest known ants evolved from a lineage within the [[Aculeata|aculeate]] wasps, and a recent study suggests that they are a sister group of [[Apoidea]].&lt;ref name="Johnson_2013"/&gt; During the Cretaceous ants were confined to the northern [[Laurasia]]n supercontinent, with only a few widespread primitive species.&lt;ref name="Holldobler_Wilson_1990"/&gt; By the middle Eocene, around 50 million years ago, ants had diversified and become ecologically dominant as predators and scavengers. Ant species are less than 2% of the total number of insect species but make up one third of the insect biomass.&lt;ref name="Wilson_Holldobler_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimaldi_Agosti_2000"/&gt;

==History of classification==
[[File:A Formica rufa sideview.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Formica rufa]]'', one of the seventeen species of ants described by Linnaeus (1758) in his ''Systema Naturae''&lt;ref name="Linnaeus_1758"/&gt;]]

In volume 1 of ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]'', [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] (1758) described seventeen species of ants, all of which he placed in the single [[genus]] ''[[Formica]]''.&lt;ref name="Linnaeus_1758"/&gt; Within a few decades additional genera had been recognized, and this trend continued in the ensuing years, together with the development of a more complex hierarchical classification in which genera were apportioned among subfamilies and [[tribe (biology)|tribes]]. The ant species described by Linnaeus are now dispersed in eleven different genera, belonging to four subfamilies.&lt;ref name="Ward_2007"/&gt;

For much of the twentieth century the number of recognized ant subfamilies varied from seven to ten, with the Aneuretinae, Cerapachyinae, Leptanillinae, Myrmeciinae and Pseudomyrmecinae being variously treated as separate subfamilies or (at different times) subsumed within Dolichoderinae, Ponerinae, Dorylinae, Ponerinae, and Myrmicinae, respectively.&lt;ref name="Ward_2007"/&gt; In 2014, Brady ''et al.'' [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymized]] the army ant subfamilies and their closest relatives under Dorylinae; this clade, the dorylomorph subfamilies, previously also contained Aenictinae, Aenictogitoninae, Cerapachyinae, Ecitoninae and Leptanilloidinae.&lt;ref name="Brady_et_al_2014"/&gt;

The last three decades have seen a proliferation of subfamily names, as a result of three factors: (1) the realization that some subfamilies were assemblages of unrelated taxa; (2) abandonment of [[paraphyletic]] taxa, and (3) the discovery of novel fossil taxa.&lt;ref name="Ward_2007"/&gt; Seventeen extant subfamilies of ants are currently recognized, along with four extinct subfamilies.&lt;ref name="AntCat_Formicidae"/&gt; One of the fossil taxa, [[Armaniinae]], is often given [[family (biology)|family]] rank within the [[Superfamily (biology)|superfamily]] [[Formicoidea]].&lt;ref name="Ward_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engel&amp;Grimaldi_2005"/&gt; About 13 genera are ''[[incertae sedis]]'' (of uncertain placement), and are not assigned to any subfamily.&lt;ref name="AntCat_Formicidae"/&gt;

{{refimprove|date=July 2012}}

'''Mainland''' is a [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]] [[landmass]] that is larger and often [[human geography|politically, economically and/or demographically]] more significant than [[political geography|politically associated]] [[Outlying territory|remote territories]], such as [[exclaves]] or [[oceanic islands]] situated outside the [[continental shelf]]. 

In geography, "mainland" can denote the [[continent]]al (i.e. non-insular) part of any [[polity]] or the main island within an [[island nation]]. In [[geopolitics]], "mainland" is sometimes used interchangeably with terms like [[Metropolis#Metropolis as a mainland area|Metropole]] as an antonym to [[overseas territories]]. In the sense of "[[wikt:heartland|heartland]]", mainland is the opposite of [[wikt:periphery|periphery]].

The term is relative- in [[Tasmania]], continental [[Australia]] is the mainland, while to residents of [[Flinders Island]], the main island of Tasmania is also "the mainland".

{{refimprove|date=January 2011}}
'''Mains electricity by country''' includes a list of countries and territories, with the [[electric plug|plug]]s, [[voltage]]s and [[Utility frequency|frequencies]] they commonly use for providing electrical power to appliances, equipment, and lighting typically found in homes and offices. (For industrial machinery, see [[Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets]].) Some countries have more than one voltage available (notably North America which uses the split-phase system where most sockets are attached to a 120&amp;nbsp;V supply, but there is a 240&amp;nbsp;V supply available for appliances requiring greater power).  Sometimes different plugs are mandated for different voltage or current levels.

Voltage, frequency, and plug type vary widely, but large regions may use common standards. Physical compatibility of receptacles may not ensure compatibility of voltage, frequency, or connection to earth (ground), including [[AC power plugs and sockets#Voltage rating of plugs and power cords|plugs and cords]]. In some areas, older standards may still exist. Foreign enclaves, extraterritorial government installations, or buildings frequented by tourists may support plugs not otherwise used in a country, for the convenience of travellers.

==Main reference source{{snd}}IEC World Plugs==
 
The [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] publishes a web microsite ''World Plugs''&lt;ref name="World Plugs"&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/ World Plugs]. [[International Electrotechnical Commission|International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)]]. Retrieved on 2018-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides the main source for this page, except where other sources are indicated. ''World Plugs'' includes some history, a description of plug types, and a list of countries giving the type(s) used and the mains voltage and frequency.
 
Although useful for quick reference, especially for travellers, ''IEC World Plugs'' may not be regarded as totally accurate, as illustrated by the examples in the plugs section below, and errors may exist, such as Indonesia being listed as using both 220 V and 110 V when the Indonesian Standard ''SPLN 1''&lt;ref name="SPLN 1 : 1995"&gt;{{cite web|last=SPLN 1 : 1995 |first=Standar PLN |title=Tegangan-tegangan Standar |url=http://km.plnbatam.com/spln/download.php?file_id=143 |accessdate=1 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204022404/http://km.plnbatam.com/spln/download.php?file_id=143 |archivedate=4 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; clearly states the voltage as 230 V, and the official travel website says ''"electric power supply is 220 volts in all regions."''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/before-you-go&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voltages==

Voltages in this article are the nominal single-phase supply voltages, or split-phase supply voltages. Three-phase and industrial loads may have other voltages.

All voltages are [[root mean square]] voltage; the peak AC voltage is greater by a factor of {{radic|2}}, and the [[peak-to-peak]] voltage greater by a factor of 2{{radic|2}}.

==Plugs==
{{Main|AC power plugs and sockets}}

The system of plug types using a single letter (from A to N) used here is from ''World Plugs'', which defines the plug type letters in terms of a general description, without making reference to specific standards. Where a plug does not have a specific letter code assigned to it, then it may be defined by the style sheet number listed in IEC&amp;nbsp;TR&amp;nbsp;60083.&lt;ref name="IEC 60083"/&gt; ''World Plugs'' gives a (not always correct) list of what plug types are used where. The Type N description is of the two variations of Brazilian plug (Brazilian national standard NBR 14136); however, the original plug and socket is defined in [[IEC&amp;nbsp;60906-1]] and has been adopted as a South African national Standard ([[SANS 164#SANS 164-2|SANS 164-2]]). The Brazilian version is non-compliant with the IEC standard. Not all plugs are included in the letter system; for example, there is no designation for the plugs defined by the Thai National Standard ''TIS&amp;nbsp;116-2549'', though some web sites refer to the three-pin plug described in that standard as "Type O".

[[File:Fis01334 (27555144884).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Multibeam sonar is used to map the ocean floor]]
A '''multibeam echosounder''' is a type of [[sonar]] that is used to map the seabed. Like other sonar systems, multibeam systems emit sound waves in a fan shape beneath a ship's hull. The amount of time it takes for the sound waves to bounce off the seabed and return to a receiver is used to determine water depth. Unlike other sonars, multibeam systems use [[beamforming]] to extract directional information from the returning soundwaves, producing a swath of depth readings from a single ping.

==History and progression==
[[File:US Navy 030411-N-0000X-001 A detailed multibeam image for the survey of USS Susan B. Anthony (AP-72).jpg|thumb|A multibeam image of the [[USS Susan B. Anthony (AP-72)|USS ''Susan B. Anthony'' (AP-72)]] shipwreck off the coast of France.]]
Multibeam sonar sounding systems, also known as ''swathe'' (British English) or ''swath'' (American English), originated for military applications. The Sonar Array Sounding System (SASS) was developed in the early 1960s by the [[United States Navy|US Navy]], in conjunction with [[General Instrument]] to map large swaths of the [[Seabed|ocean floor]] to assist the underwater navigation of its [[submarine]] force.&lt;ref name=50yrs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hydro-international.com/issues/articles/id1471-A_Note_on_Fifty_Years_ofMultibeam.html |title=A Note on Fifty Years of Multi-beam |author=Albert E. Theberge Jr. and Norman Z. Cherkis  |date=22 May 2013 |work= |publisher=Hydro International |accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mp-www.nrl.navy.mil/marine_physics_branch/introduction.htm |title=GOMaP GLOBAL OCEAN MAPPING PROJECT |author=U.S. Naval Research Laboratory/Marine Physics Branch (Code 7420) |date= |work= |publisher=U.S. Naval Research Laboratory |accessdate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702061936/http://mp-www.nrl.navy.mil/marine_physics_branch/introduction.htm |archivedate=2 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SASS was tested aboard the [[USS Compass Island (AG-153)|USS ''Compass Island'' (AG-153)]]. The final array system, composed of sixty-one one degree beams with a swath width of approximately 1.15 times water depth, was then installed on the [[USNS Bowditch (T-AGS-21)|USNS ''Bowditch'' (T-AGS-21)]], [[USNS Dutton (T-AGS-22)|USNS ''Dutton'' (T-AGS-22)]] and [[USNS Michelson (T-AGS-23)|USNS ''Michelson'' (T-AGS-23)]].&lt;ref name=50yrs /&gt;

Starting in the 1970s, companies such as General Instrument (now SeaBeam Instruments, part of [[L3 Klein]]) in the [[United States]], Krupp Atlas (now [[Atlas Hydrographic]]) and Elac Nautik (now part of the Wärtsilä Corporation) in [[Germany]], Simrad (now [[Kongsberg Maritime]]) in [[Norway]] and RESON now Teledyne RESON A/S in [[Denmark]] developed systems that could be mounted to the hull of large [[ship]]s, and then small [[boat]]s (as technologies improved and operating frequencies increased).

The first commercial multibeam is now known as the SeaBeam Classic and was put in service in May 1977&lt;ref&gt;Harold Farr, Marine Geodesy, Volume 4, Issue 2 1980, pages 77 – 93&lt;/ref&gt; on the Australian survey vessel HMAS Cook. This system produced up to 16 beams across a 45-degree arc. The ([[retronym]]) term "SeaBeam Classic" was coined after the manufacturer developed newer systems such as the SeaBeam 2000 and the SeaBeam 2112 in the late 1980s.

The second SeaBeam Classic installation was on the French Research Vessel Jean Charcot. The SB Classic arrays on the Charcot were damaged in a grounding and the SeaBeam was replaced with an EM120 in 1991. Although it seems that the original SeaBeam Classic installation was not used much, the others were widely used, and subsequent installations were made on many vessels.

SeaBeam Classic systems were subsequently installed on the US academic [[research vessel]]s {{ship|USNS|Thomas Washington|T-AGOR-10}} ([[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], [[University of California]]), the {{ship|USNS|Robert D. Conrad}} ([[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] of [[Columbia University]]) and the {{ship|RV|Atlantis II}} ([[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]).

As technology improved in the 1980s and 1990s, higher-frequency systems suitable for high-resolution mapping in shallow water were developed, and such systems are widely used for shallow-water [[hydrography|hydrographic surveying]] in support of navigational [[Nautical chart|charting]]. Multibeam echosounders are also commonly used for [[Marine geology|geological]] and [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] research, and since the 1990s for offshore oil and gas [[exploration]] and seafloor cable routing.   

In 1989, Atlas Electronics (Bremen, Germany) installed a second-generation deep-sea multibeam called Hydrosweep DS on the German research vessel Meteor. The Hydrosweep DS (HS-DS) produced up to 59 beams across a 90-degree swath, which was a vast improvement and was inherently ice-strengthened. Early HS-DS systems were installed on the {{ship|RV|Meteor (1986)}} (Germany), the {{ship|RV|Polarstern}} (Germany), the {{ship|RV|Maurice Ewing}} (US) and the {{ship|ORV|Sagar Kanya}} (India) in 1989 and 1990 and subsequently on a number of other vessels including the {{ship|RV|Thomas G. Thompson}} (US) and {{ship|RV|Hakurei Maru}} (Japan).

As the cost of components has decreased, the number of multibeam systems sold and in operation worldwide has increased significantly.  Smaller, portable systems can be operated on a small launch or tender vessel unlike the older systems that required considerable time and effort to attach to a ship's hull.  Some multibeam echosounders such as the Teledyne Odom MB2 also incorporate a motion sensor at the face of the acoustic transducer, allowing even faster installation on small vessels.  Multibeam echosounders like this are allowing many smaller hydrographic survey companies to move from traditional single beam echosounders to swath systems.

Multibeam data includes bathymetry, acoustic backscatter, and water column data.  Gas plumes now commonly identified in midwater multibeam data are termed flares.

[[File:Teledyne Odom MB1 multibeam echosounder.jpg|thumb|A multibeam echosounder showing the transmit array (larger black rectangle) and receive array (narrower rectangle) - Odom MB1]]

==Theory of operation==

A multibeam echosounder is a device typically used by hydrographic surveyors to determine the depth of water and the nature of the seabed. Most modern systems work by transmitting a broad acoustic fan shaped pulse from a specially designed [[transducer]] across the full swath acrosstrack with a narrow alongtrack then forming multiple receive beams ([[beamforming]]) that are much narrower in the acrosstrack (around 1 degree depending on the system). From this narrow beam, a two way travel time of the acoustic pulse is then established utilizing a bottom detection algorithm. If the speed of sound in water is known for the full water column profile, the depth and position of the return signal can be determined from the receive angle and the two-way travel time.  

In order to determine the transmit and receive angle of each beam, a multibeam echosounder requires accurate measurement of the motion of the sonar relative to a cartesian coordinate system. The measured values are typically heave, pitch, roll, [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]], and heading.

To compensate for signal loss due to spreading and absorption a [[time-varied gain]] circuit is designed into the receiver.

For deep water systems, a steerable transmit beam is required to compensate for pitch. This can also be accomplished with beamforming.

{{Greek myth}}

'''Orpheus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔr|f|i|ə|s|,_|ˈ|ɔr|f|juː|s}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Ὀρφεύς, classical pronunciation: {{IPA|/or.pʰeú̯s/}}) is a legendary musician, poet, and [[prophet]] in [[ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology|myth]]. Some ancient Greek sources note Orpheus' [[Thracians|Thracian]] origins.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Graf and Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Ritual Texts for the Afterlife: Orpheus and the Bacchic Gold Tablets'' (Routledge, 2007), p. 167, while taking note of depictions in [[Art in ancient Greece|Greek art]], particularly [[Pottery of ancient Greece|vase painting]], that show Orpheus attired as a Greek, often in contrast to those in Thracian dress around him.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tzeztes, his home was the [[Odrysian kingdom|Odrysian]] city of [[Bisaltia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tzetzes]]. ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/TzetzesChiliades1.html#12 Chiliades, 1.12 line 305]''&lt;/ref&gt; The major stories about him are centered on his ability to charm all living things and even stones with his music, his attempt to retrieve his wife, [[Eurydice]], from the [[Greek underworld|underworld]], and his death at the hands of those who could not hear his divine music. As an archetype of the inspired singer, Orpheus is one of the most significant figures in the [[reception theory|reception]] of [[classical mythology]] in [[Western culture]], portrayed or [[allusion|alluded]] to in countless forms of art and popular culture including poetry, film, opera, music, and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Miles, ''Classical Mythology in English Literature: A Critical Anthology'' (Routledge, 1999), p. 54ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Greeks, Orpheus was a founder and prophet of the so-called [[Orphism (religion)|"Orphic" mysteries]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece, Corinth, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.30.2 2.30.2]&lt;/ref&gt; He was credited with the composition of the  '''''Orphic Hymns'''''&lt;!--boldfaced per WP:R#PLA--&gt; and the Orphic ''[[Argonautica Orphica| Argonautica]]''. Shrines containing purported [[Relic#Relics in classical antiquity|relics]] of Orpheus were regarded as [[oracle]]s.

==Etymology==
Several etymologies for the name ''Orpheus'' have been proposed.

==Background==
The earliest literary reference to Orpheus is a two-word fragment of the sixth-century BC lyric poet [[Ibycus]]: ''onomaklyton Orphēn'' ("Orpheus famous-of-name"). He is not mentioned in [[Homer]] or [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibycus, ''Fragments'' 17 (Diehl); [[M. Owen Lee]], ''Virgil as Orpheus: A Study of the Georgics'' State University of New York Press, Albany (1996), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Most ancient sources accept his historical existence; Aristotle is an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Freeman, [https://books.google.ie/books?id=ASijqFryr5IC ''Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers''], Harvard University Press (1948), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/worksofaristotle12arisuoft#page/80/mode/2up|title=The Works of Aristotle|year=1952|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|volume=XII – Fragments|author=Aristotle|editor1=[[W. D.

Greeks of the [[Classical Greece|Classical age]] venerated Orpheus as the greatest of all poets and musicians; it was said that while [[Hermes]] had invented the [[lyre]], Orpheus had perfected it. Poets such as [[Simonides of Ceos]] said that Orpheus' music and singing could charm the birds, fish and wild beasts, coax the trees and rocks into dance,&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 1.3.2; [[Euripides]], ''[[Iphigeneia at Aulis]]'', 1212 and ''[[The Bacchae]]'', 562; Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 11: "with his songs, Orpheus, the bard of Thrace, allured the trees, the savage animals, and even the insensate rocks, to follow him&gt;"&lt;/ref&gt; and divert the course of rivers. Orpheus was one of the handful of [[Greek hero]]es&lt;ref&gt;Others to brave the ''[[nekyia]]'' were [[Odysseus]], [[Theseus]] and [[Heracles]]; [[Perseus]] also overcame [[Medusa]] in a [[chthonic]] setting.&lt;/ref&gt; to visit the Underworld and return; his music and song even had power over [[Hades]].

Some sources credit Orpheus with further gifts to mankind: [[medicine]], which is more usually under the auspices of [[Aesculapius]] or [[Apollo]]; [[writing]],&lt;ref&gt;A single literary epitaph, attributed to the [[sophist]] [[Alcidamas]], credits Orpheus with the invention of writing. See [[Ivan Mortimer Linforth]], "Two Notes on the Legend of Orpheus", ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''62''', (1931):5–17).&lt;/ref&gt; which is usually credited to [[Cadmus]]; and [[agriculture]], where Orpheus assumes the [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusinian]] role of [[Triptolemus]] as giver of Demeter's knowledge to mankind. Orpheus was an [[augur]] and seer; he practiced magical arts and [[astrology]], founded cults to [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]&lt;ref name="Apollodorus1.3.2"&gt;Apollodorus ([[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo Apollodorus]]), [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.3.2 ''Library and Epitome'', 1.3.2]. "Orpheus also invented the mysteries of Dionysus, and having been torn in pieces by the Maenads he is buried in Pieria."&lt;/ref&gt; and prescribed the mystery rites preserved in Orphic texts. Pindar and [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius, ''[[Argonautica]]'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; place Orpheus as the harpist and companion of [[Argonautica|Jason and the Argonauts]]. Orpheus had a brother named [[Linus of Thrace|Linus]], who went to [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] and became a Theban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+2.4.9#fn1 Apollodorus, Library and Epitome, 2.4.9], This Linus was a brother of Orpheus; he came to Thebes and became a Theban.&lt;/ref&gt; He is claimed by Aristophanes and Horace to have taught cannibals to subsist on fruit, and to have made lions and tigers obedient to him. Horace believed, however, that Orpheus had only introduced order and civilization to savages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strabo]] (64&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– c.&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;24) presents Orpheus as a mortal, who lived and died in a village close to Olympus.&lt;ref name="Strabo"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0198:book=7:chapter=7&amp;highlight=orpheus Strabo, ''Geography'', Book 7, Chapter 7]: "At the base of Olympus is a city Dium. And it has a village near by, Pimpleia. Here lived Orpheus, the Ciconian, it is said — a wizard who at first collected money from his music, together with his soothsaying and his celebration of the orgies connected with the mystic initiatory rites, but soon afterwards thought himself worthy of still greater things and procured for himself a throng of followers and power. Some, of course, received him willingly, but others, since they suspected a plot and violence, combined against him and killed him. And near here, also, is Leibethra."&lt;/ref&gt; "Some, of course, received him willingly, but others, since they suspected a plot and violence, combined against him and killed him." He made money as a musician and "wizard"&amp;nbsp;– Strabo uses ''agurteúonta'' (αγυρτεύοντα),&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Nagy, ''Archaic Period'' (''Greek Literature'', Volume 2), {{ISBN|0-8153-3683-7}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; also used by [[Sophocles]] in ''[[Oedipus Tyrannus]]'' to characterize [[Teiresias]] as a trickster with an excessive desire for possessions. ''Agúrtēs'' (αγύρτης) most often meant [[charlatan]]&lt;ref&gt;Index in Eustathii commentarios in Homeri Iliadem et Odysseam by Matthaeus Devarius, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and always had a negative connotation. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] writes of an unnamed [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] who considered Orpheus a ''mágeuse'' (μάγευσε), i.&amp;nbsp;e., magician.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias, ''The Description of Greece'']], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D20%3Asection%3D18 6.20.18]: "A man of Egypt said that Pelops received something from Amphion the Theban and buried it where is what they call Taraxippus, adding that it was the buried thing which frightened the mares of Oenomaus, as well as those of every charioteer since. This Egyptian thought that Amphion and the Thracian Orpheus were clever magicians, and that it was through their enchantments that the beasts came to Orpheus, and the stones came to Amphion for the building of the wall. The most probable of the stories in my opinion makes Taraxippus a surname of Horse Poseidon."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=January 2016}}

==Mythology==
===Early life===
[[File:Life of Orpheus Greek Mythology.svg|thumb|Important sites in the life and travels of Orpheus]]

According to [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]]&lt;ref&gt;Son of Oeagrus or Apollo and Calliope: Apollodorus 1.3.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and a fragment of Pindar,&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, frag. 126, line 9, noted in Kerényi 1959: 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Orpheus' father was [[Oeagrus]], a [[Thrace|Thracian]] king, or, according to another version of the story, the god [[Apollo]]. His mother was the [[muse]] [[Calliope]] or a daughter of [[Pierus (king of Macedonia)|Pierus]],&lt;ref&gt;Son of the Muse Calliope or of a daughter of Pierus: Pausanias 9.30.4.&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Makednos]] or lastly of [[Menippe (mythology)|Menippe]], daughter of [[Thamyris]]&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tzetzes]]. ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/TzetzesChiliades1.html#12 Chiliades, 1.12 line 306]''&lt;/ref&gt;. His birthplace and place of residence was in [[Pimpleia]]&lt;ref&gt;William Keith Guthrie and L. Alderlink, ''Orpheus and Greek Religion (Mythos Books)'', 1993, {{ISBN|0-691-02499-5}}, p. 61 f.: "[…] is a city Dion. Near it is a village called Pimpleia. It was there they say that Orpheus the Kikonian lived."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Greek Religion 1991, page 469"&gt;Jane Ellen Harrison, ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion (Mythos Books)'', 1991, {{ISBN|0-691-01514-7}}, p. 469: "[…] near the city of Dium is a village called Pimpleia where Orpheus lived."&lt;/ref&gt; close to the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]]. [[Strabo]] mentions that he lived in Pimpleia.&lt;ref name="Strabo" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Greek Religion 1991, page 469" /&gt; According to the epic poem ''[[Argonautica]]'', Pimpleia was the location of Oeagrus' and Calliope's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;''The Argonautica'', book I (ll. 23–34), "First then let us name Orpheus whom once Calliope bare, it is said, wedded to Thracian Oeagrus, near the Pimpleian height."&lt;/ref&gt; While living with his mother and her eight beautiful sisters in [[Parnassus]], he met [[Apollo]], who was courting the laughing muse [[Thalia (muse) |Thalia]]. Apollo, as the god of music, gave Orpheus a golden [[lyre]] and taught him to play it.&lt;ref&gt;Hoopes And Evslin, ''The Greek Gods'', {{ISBN|0-590-44110-8}}, {{ISBN|0-590-44110-8}}, 1995, p. 77: "His father was a Thracian king; his mother the muse Calliope. For a while he lived on Parnassus with his mother and his eight beautiful aunts and there met Apollo who was courting the laughing muse Thalia. Apollo was taken with Orpheus, gave him his little golden lyre and taught him to play.  And his mother taught him to make verses for singing."&lt;/ref&gt; Orpheus' mother taught him to make verses for singing. He is also said to have studied in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4B.html 4.25.2–4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Orpheus is said to have established the worship of [[Hecate]] in [[Aegina]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', Corinth, 2.30.1
[2]: "Of the gods, the Aeginetans worship most Hecate, in whose honor every year they celebrate mystic rites which, they say, Orpheus the Thracian established among them. Within the enclosure is a temple; its wooden image is the work of Myron, and it has one face and one body. It was Alcamenes, in my opinion, who first made three images of Hecate attached to one another, a figure called by the Athenians Epipurgidia (on the Tower); it stands beside the temple of the Wingless Victory."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Laconia]] Orpheus is said to have brought the worship of [[Demeter Chthonia]]&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', Laconia, 3.14.1,[5]: "[…] but the wooden image of Thetis is guarded in secret. The cult of Demeter Chthonia (of the Lower World) the Lacedaemonians say was handed on to them by Orpheus, but in my opinion it was because of the sanctuary in Hermione that the Lacedaemonians also began to worship Demeter Chthonia. The Spartans have also a sanctuary of Serapis, the newest sanctuary in the city, and one of Zeus surnamed Olympian."&lt;/ref&gt; and that of the ''Kóres Sōteíras'' ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''Κόρες Σωτείρας'' "Saviour Maidens").{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', Laconia, 3.13.1: "Opposite the Olympian Aphrodite the Lacedaemonians have a temple of the Saviour Maid. Some say that it was made by Orpheus the Thracian, others by Abairis when he had come from the Hyperboreans."&lt;/ref&gt; Also in [[Taygetus]] a wooden image of Orpheus was said to have been kept by [[Pelasgians]] in the sanctuary of the Eleusinian Demeter.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', Laconia, 3.20.1,[5]: "Between Taletum and Euoras is a place they name Therae, where they say Leto from the Peaks of Taygetus […] is a sanctuary of Demeter surnamed Eleusinian. Here according to the Lacedaemonian story Heracles was hidden by Asclepius while he was being healed of a wound. In the sanctuary is a wooden image of Orpheus, a work, they say, of Pelasgians."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Musaeus of Athens]] was the son of Orpheus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.1&amp;ndash;2].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travelling as an Argonaut===
{{Main article|Argonautica}}

The ''[[Argonautica]]'' ({{lang-el|Ἀργοναυτικά}}) is a [[Greek literature|Greek]] [[epic poem]] written by [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius Rhodius]] in the 3rd century BC. Orpheus took part in this adventure and used his skills to aid his companions. Chiron told Jason that without the aid of Orpheus, the [[Argonauts]] would never be able to pass the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s—the same Sirens encountered by [[Odysseus]] in [[Homer]]'s epic poem the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The Sirens lived on three small, rocky islands called [[Sirenum scopuli]] and sang beautiful songs that enticed sailors to come to them, which resulted in the crashing of their ships into the islands. When Orpheus heard their voices, he drew his [[lyre]] and played music that was louder and more beautiful, drowning out the Sirens' bewitching songs. According to 3rd century BC [[Hellenistic]] [[elegiac]] poet [[Phanocles]], Orpheus loved the young Argonaut [[Boreads|Calais]], "the son of Boreas, with all his heart, and went often in shaded groves still singing of his desire, nor was his heart at rest. But always, sleepless cares wasted his spirits as he looked at fresh Calais."&lt;ref name="Crawford2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katherine Crawford|title=The Sexual Culture of the French Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9TU7ZKzANkC&amp;pg=PA28|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76989-1|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Block Friedman|title=Orpheus in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_56pgczDQ8sC&amp;pg=PA9|date=2000-05-01|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-2825-5|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Eurydice===
[[File:Orfeu-atenas.jpg|upright|thumb|''Orpheus with the lyre and surrounded by beasts'' ([[Byzantine &amp; Christian Museum]], Athens)]]
{{See also|Orpheus and Eurydice}}

The most famous story in which Orpheus figures is that of his wife [[Eurydice]] (sometimes referred to as Euridice and also known as Argiope). While walking among her people, the Cicones, in tall grass at her wedding, Eurydice was set upon by a [[satyr]]. In her efforts to escape the satyr, Eurydice fell into a nest of vipers and suffered a fatal bite on her heel. Her body was discovered by Orpheus who, overcome with grief, played such sad and mournful songs that all the [[nymph]]s and gods wept. On their advice, Orpheus travelled to the [[underworld]]. His music softened the hearts of [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]], who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth on one condition: he should walk in front of her and not look back until they both had reached the upper world. He set off with Eurydice following, and, in his anxiety, as soon as he reached the upper world, he turned to look at her, forgetting that both needed to be in the upper world, and she vanished for the second time, but now forever.

The story in this form belongs to the time of [[Virgil]], who first introduces the name of [[Aristaeus]] (by the time of Virgil's ''[[Georgics]]'', the myth has Aristaeus chasing Eurydice when she was bitten by a serpent) and the tragic outcome.&lt;ref&gt;M. Owen Lee, ''Virgil as Orpheus: A Study of the Georgics'', State University of New York Press, Albany (1996), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient writers, however, speak of Orpheus' visit to the underworld in a more negative light; according to Phaedrus in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text=Sym.:section=179d ''Symposium'' 179d].&lt;/ref&gt; the infernal gods only "presented an apparition" of Eurydice to him. In fact, Plato's representation of Orpheus is that of a coward, as instead of choosing to die in order to be with the one he loved, he instead mocked the gods by trying to go to Hades to bring her back alive. Since his love was not "true"—he did not want to die for love—he was actually punished by the gods, first by giving him only the apparition of his former wife in the underworld, and then by being killed by women. In [[Ovid]]'s account, however, Eurydice's death by a snake bite is incurred while she was dancing with [[naiad]]s on her wedding day.

Virgil wrote in his poem that [[Dryads]] wept from [[Orithyia|Epirus]] and [[Maritsa|Hebrus]] up to the land of the [[Getae]] (north east Danube valley) and even describes him wandering into [[Hyperborea]] and [[Tanais]] (ancient Greek city in the Don river delta)&lt;ref name="Virgil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/virgil/geo/geo04.htm|title=The Georgics of Virgil: Fourth Book|website=www.sacred-texts.com|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to his grief.

The story of Eurydice may actually be a late addition to the Orpheus myths. In particular, the name ''Eurudike'' ("she whose justice extends widely") recalls cult-titles attached to [[Persephone]]. According to the theories of poet [[Robert Graves]], the myth may have been derived from another Orpheus legend, in which he travels to [[Tartarus]] and charms the goddess [[Hecate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Graves]], ''[[The Greek Myths]]'', Penguin Books Ltd., London (1955), Volume 1, Chapter 28, "Orpheus", p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth theme of not looking back, an essential precaution in [[Jason]]'s raising of [[chthonic]] [[Brimo]] [[Hecate|Hekate]] under [[Medea]]'s guidance,&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'', book III: "Let no footfall or barking of dogs cause you to turn around, lest you ruin everything", Medea warns Jason; after the dread rite, "The son of Aison was seized by fear, but even so he did not turn round..."  (Richard Hunter, translator).&lt;/ref&gt; is reflected in the Biblical story of [[Lot (Biblical)|Lot]]'s wife when escaping from [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. More directly, the story of Orpheus is similar to the ancient Greek tales of Persephone captured by Hades and similar stories of [[Adonis]] captive in the underworld. However, the developed form of the Orpheus myth was entwined with the Orphic mystery cults and, later in Rome, with the development of [[Mithraism]] and the cult of [[Sol Invictus]].

===Death===

According to a [[Late Antique]] summary of [[Aeschylus]]' lost play ''Bassarids'', Orpheus, towards the end of his life, disdained the worship of all gods except the sun, whom he called [[Apollo]]. One early morning he went to the oracle of [[Dionysus]] at [[Mount Pangaion]]&lt;ref name="L. Alderlink page 32"&gt;Orpheus and Greek Religion by William Keith Guthrie and L. Alderlink, {{ISBN|0-691-02499-5}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; 
to salute his god at dawn, but was ripped to shreds by Thracian [[Maenad]]s for not honoring his previous patron ([[Dionysus]]) and buried in [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]].&lt;ref name="Apollodorus1.3.2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, N., ''Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece'', Routledge, 2013, {{ISBN|113678800X}}, p. 702: "His grave and cult belong not to Thrace but to Pierian Macedonia, northeast of Mount Olympus, a region that the Thracians had once inhabited&lt;/ref&gt; 
Here his death is analogous with that of [[Pentheus]], who was also torn to pieces by Maenads; and it has been speculated that the Orphic mystery cult regarded Orpheus as a parallel figure to or even an incarnation of Dionysus.&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mythology, p. 279, Mark P. O. Morford, Robert J. Lenardon.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Both made similar journeys into Hades, and Dionysus Zagreus suffered an identical death.&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', volume 88, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] writes that Orpheus was buried in Dion and that he met his death there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.30.4 Pausanias, Description of Greece, Boeotia, 9.30.1]. The Macedonians who dwell in the district below Mount Pieria and the city of Dium say that it was here that Orpheus met his end at the hands of the women. Going from Dium along the road to the mountain, and advancing twenty stades, you come to a pillar on the right surmounted by a stone urn, which according to the natives contains the bones of Orpheus.&lt;/ref&gt; 
He writes that the river [[Helicon (river)|Helicon]] sank underground when the women that killed Orpheus tried to wash off their blood-stained hands in its waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.30.4 Pausanias, Description of Greece, Boeotia, 9.30.1]. There is also a river called Helicon. After a course of seventy-five stades the stream hereupon disappears under the earth. After a gap of about twenty-two stades the water rises again, and under the name of Baphyra instead of Helicon flows into the sea as a navigable river. The people of Dium say that at first this river flowed on land throughout its course. But, they go on to say, the women who killed Orpheus wished to wash off in it the blood-stains, and thereat the river sank underground, so as not to lend its waters to cleanse manslaughter&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovid]] recounts that Orpheus ... {{quote|had abstained from the love of women, either because things ended badly for him, or because he had sworn to do so.

His head and lyre, still singing mournful songs, floated down the River [[Maritsa|Hebrus]] into the sea, afterwhich the winds and waves carried them to the island of [[Lesbos]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maicar.com/GML/Orpheus.html Carlos Parada] "His head fell into the sea and was cast by the waves upon the island of Lesbos where the Lesbians buried it, and for having done this the Lesbians have the reputation of being skilled in music."&lt;/ref&gt; at the city of Methymna; there, the inhabitants buried his head and a shrine was built in his honour near [[Antissa]];&lt;ref&gt;Recently a cave was identified as the oracle of Orpheus nearby the modern village of Antissa; see Harissis H. V. et al. "The Spelios of Antissa; The oracle of Orpheus in Lesvos" ''Archaiologia kai Technes'' 2002; 83:68–73 ([https://www.academia.edu/1510611/ article in Greek with English abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the people of Lesbos, Greeks from Ionia and Aetolia consulted the oracle, and his reputation spread as far as Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orpheus' [[lyre]] was carried to heaven by the [[Muse]]s, and was placed [[Lyra|among the stars]]. The Muses also gathered up the fragments of his body and buried them at [[Leibethra]]&lt;ref&gt;The Writing of Orpheus: Greek Myth in Cultural Context by Marcele Detienne, {{ISBN|0-8018-6954-4}}, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; 
below [[Mount Olympus]], where the [[nightingale]]s sang over his grave. After the river [[Sys]] flooded&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.30.4 Pausanias, Description of Greece, Boeotia, 9.30.1] [11] Immediately when night came the god sent heavy rain, and the river Sys (Boar), one of the torrents about Olympus, on this occasion threw down the walls of Libethra, overturning sanctuaries of gods and houses of men, and drowning the inhabitants and all the animals in the city. When Libethra was now a city of ruin, the Macedonians in Dium, according to my friend of Larisa, carried the bones of Orpheus to their own country.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Leibethra, the Macedonians took his bones to [[Dion, Greece|Dion]]. Orpheus' soul returned to the underworld, to the fields of the Blessed, where he was reunited at last with his beloved Eurydice. 

Another legend places his tomb at Dion,&lt;ref name="L. Alderlink page 32" /&gt; near [[Pydna]] in [[Macedon]]. In another version of the myth, Orpheus travels to [[Aornum]] in [[Thesprotia]], [[Epirus]] to an old oracle for the dead. In the end Orpheus commits suicide from his grief unable to find Eurydice.&lt;ref&gt;Others have said that his wife died before him, and that for her sake he came to Aornum in Thesprotis, where of old was an oracle of the dead. He thought, they say, that the soul of Eurydice followed him, but turning round he lost her, and committed suicide for grief. The Thracians say that such nightingales as nest on the grave of Orpheus sing more sweetly and louder than others.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.30.4 Pausanias, Description of Greece, Boeotia, 9.30.1].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another account relates that he was struck with lightning by [[Zeus]] for having lied about the stories and the mysteries of the gods.

==Orphic poems and rites&lt;!--linked from 'Orphism (religion)', 'Orphic Hymns', and 'Orphic hymns'--&gt;==
[[File:Nymphs finding the Head of Orpheus.jpg|thumb|upright|''Nymphs Finding the Head of Orpheus'' by [[John William Waterhouse]]]]
{{Main article|Orphism (religion)}}

A number of Greek religious poems in [[hexameter]]s were attributed to Orpheus, as they were to similar miracle-working figures, like [[Bakis]], [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]], [[Abaris]], [[Aristeas]], [[Epimenides]], and the [[Sibyl]]. Of this vast literature, only two works survived whole: the ''Orphic Hymns'', a set of 87 poems, possibly composed at some point in the second or third century, and the epic poem ''[[Argonautica Orphica|Argonautica]]'', composed somewhere between the fourth and sixth centuries. Earlier Orphic literature, which may date back as far as the sixth century BC, survives only in [[papyrus]] fragments or in quotations. Some of the earliest fragments may have been composed by [[Onomacritus]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Kathleen. [https://books.google.ie/books?id=ASijqFryr5IC ''Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers''], Harvard University Press (1948), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles François Jalabert - Nymphs Listening to the Songs of Orpheus - Walters 3737.jpg|left|thumb|''Nymphs Listening to the Songs of Orpheus'' (1853) by [[Charles Jalabert]]]]

In addition to serving as a storehouse of mythological data along the lines of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Orphic poetry was recited in mystery-rites and purification rituals. [[Plato]] in particular tells of a class of vagrant beggar-priests who would go about offering purifications to the rich, a clatter of books by Orpheus and [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]] in tow.&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' 364c–d.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were especially devoted to these rituals and poems often practiced [[vegetarianism]] and abstention from sex, and refrained from eating eggs and beans — which came to be known as the ''Orphikos bios'', or "Orphic way of life".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 56: "the use of eggs and beans was forbidden, for these articles were associated with the worship of the dead".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Derveni papyrus]], found in [[Derveni, Thessaloniki|Derveni]], [[Macedonia (Greece)]] in 1962, contains a philosophical treatise that is an allegorical commentary on an Orphic poem in hexameters, a theogony concerning the birth of the gods, produced in the circle of the philosopher [[Anaxagoras]], written in the second half of the fifth century BC. Fragments of the poem are quoted making it "the most important new piece of evidence about Greek philosophy and religion to come to light since the Renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2006/2006-10-29.html | last= Janko| first= Richard |journal= Bryn Mawr Classical Review |year= 2006|editor1-first= K. |editor1-last=Tsantsanoglou |editor2-first= G.M. |editor2-last=Parássoglou |editor3-first=T. |editor3-last= Kouremenos | title= The Derveni Papyrus |location= Florence: Olschki |series= Studi e testi per il 'Corpus dei papiri filosofici greci e latini' |volume= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papyrus dates to around 340 BC, during the reign of [[Philip II of Macedon]], making it Europe's oldest surviving manuscript.

The historian [[William Mitford]] wrote in 1784 that the very earliest form of a higher and more cohesive ancient Greek religion was manifest in the Orphic poems.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 89: "But the very early inhabitants of Greece had a religion far less degenerated from original purity. To this curious and interesting fact, abundant testimonies remain. They occur in those poems, of uncertain origin and uncertain date, but unquestionably of great antiquity, which are called the poems of Orpheus or rather the Orphic poems [Note: Particularly in the Hymn to Jupiter, quoted by [[Aristotle]] in the seventh chapter of his Treatise on the World]; and they are found scattered among the writings of the philosophers and historians." The idea of a religion "degenerated from original purity" expressed an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] idealisation of an assumed primitive state that is one connotation of "[[primitivism]]" in the [[history of ideas]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. K. C. Guthrie]] wrote that Orpheus was the founder of [[mystery religions]] and the first to reveal to men the meanings of the initiation rites.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, pp. 17–18. "As founder of mystery-religions, Orpheus was first to reveal to men the meaning of the rites of initiation (''teletai''). We read of this in both Plato and Aristophanes (Aristophanes, ''Frogs'', 1032; Plato, ''Republic'', 364e, a passage which suggests that literary authority was made to take the responsibility for the rites)". Guthrie goes on to write about "This less worthy but certainly popular side of Orphism is represented for us again by the charms or incantations of Orpheus which we may also read of as early as the fifth century. Our authority is [[Euripides]]. We have already noticed the 'charm on the Thracian tablets' in the ''Alcestis'' and in ''Cyclops'' one of the lazy and frightened Satyrs, unwilling to help Odysseus in the task of driving the burning stake into the single eye of the giant, exclaims: 'But I know a spell of Orpheus, a fine one, which will make the brand step up of its own accord to burn this one-eyed son of Earth' (Euripides, ''Cyclops'' 646 = Kern, test. 83)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Classical interpretations==
===Classical music===
The Orpheus motif has permeated [[Western culture]] and has been used as a theme in all art forms. Early examples include the [[Breton lai]] ''[[Sir Orfeo]]'' from the early 13th century and musical interpretations like [[Jacapo Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'' (1600, though titled with his wife's name, the libretto is based entirely upon books X and XI of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and therefore Orpheus' viewpoint is predominant). Subsequent operatic interpretations include [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607), [[Orfeo (Rossi)|Luigi Rossi's L'Orfeo]] (1647), [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]'s ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' (1762), [[Joseph Haydn]]'s last opera ''[[L'anima del filosofo]], ossia Orfeo ed Euridice'' (1791), [[Franz Liszt]]'s symphonic poem ''Orpheus'' (1854), [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ballet ''[[Orpheus (ballet)|Orpheus]]'' (1948) and two operas by [[Harrison Birtwistle]]: ''[[The Mask of Orpheus]]'' (1973–1984) and [[The Corridor (opera)|''The Corridor'']] (2009). The Bulgarian [[Rousse State Opera]] commissioned and performed ''Orpheus: A Masque'' by [[John Robertson (composer)|John Robertson]]. It debuted in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rousse State Opera]]. [http://www.ruseopera.com/page.php?Cod_fam=12&amp;Cod_sub=156&amp;Cod_not=1019 "Световна премиера на операта „Орфей” от канадския композитор Джон Робъртсън в МФ „Сцена край реката”-Русе"] ("World Premiere of the opera "Orpheus" by Canadian composer John Robertson"). Retrieved 22 February 2016 {{Bg icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
[[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s ''[[Sonnets to Orpheus]]'' (1922) are based on the Orpheus myth. [[Poul Anderson]]'s Hugo Award-winning novelette "[[Goat Song (novelette)|Goat Song]]", published in 1972, is a retelling of the story of Orpheus in a science fiction setting. Some [[feminism|feminist]] interpretations of the myth give Eurydice greater weight. [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''Orpheus and Eurydice Cycle'' (1976–86) deals with the myth, and gives Eurydice a more prominent voice. [[Sarah Ruhl]]'s ''[[Eurydice (Ruhl play)|Eurydice]]'' likewise presents the story of Orpheus' descent to the underworld from Eurydice's perspective. Ruhl removes Orpheus from the center of the story by pairing their romantic love with the paternal love of Eurydice's dead father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/theater/reviews/19seco.html|first=Charles|last=Isherwood|work=New York Times|authorlink=Charles Isherwood|date=2007-06-19|title=The Power of Memory to Triumph Over Death}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Almond]]'s 2014 novel, ''[[A Song for Ella Grey]]'', was inspired by the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, and won the [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/nov/19/david-almond-wins-guardian-childrens-fiction-prize&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 2014 novel [[Orfeo (novel)|''Orfeo'']] by [[Richard Powers]] is based on Orpheus.{{cn|date=April 2018}}{{clarify|date=April 2018}}

===Film and the graphic arts===
[[File:Muerte de OrfeoGarciaVega.jpg|thumb|upright|''Death of Orpheus'' by Mexican artist [[Antonio García Vega]]]]

[[Vinicius de Moraes]]' play ''[[Orfeu da Conceição]]'' (1956), later adapted by [[Marcel Camus]] in the 1959 film ''[[Black Orpheus]]'', tells the story in the modern context of a [[favela]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] during [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnaval]]. [[Jean Cocteau]]'s [[Orphic Trilogy]]&amp;nbsp;– ''[[The Blood of a Poet]]'' (1930), [[Orpheus (film)|''Orpheus'']] (1950) and ''[[Testament of Orpheus]]'' (1959)&amp;nbsp;– was filmed over thirty years, and is based in many ways on the story. [[Philip Glass]] adapted [[Orpheus (film)|the second film]] into the [[chamber opera]] [[Philip Glass#Cocteau trilogy and symphonies|''Orphée'']] (1991), part of a homage [[triptych]] to Cocteau. [[Nikos Nikolaidis]]' 1975 film ''[[Evrydiki BA 2O37]]'' is an innovative perspective on the classic Greek tragedy of [[Orpheus and Eurydice]].

[[Dino Buzzati]] adapted the Orpheus motif in his graphic novel ''Poem Strip'' (1969). [[Neil Gaiman]] depicts his version of Orpheus in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' comics series (1989–2015). Gaiman's Orpheus is the son of Oneiros (the Dream Lord Morpheus) and the muse Calliope.&lt;ref&gt;Gaiman, Neil. ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' #50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular music===
In August 1967 the UK rock band [[The Herd (British band)|The Herd]] released a single whose A-side was a version of the Orpheus story written by Howard Blaikley called "From the Underworld" which reached No. 6 in the charts. Also [[The Incredible String Band]]'s 1967 song "Blues for the Muse" (from the album ''[[The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion]]'') mentions Orpheus in the lyric "But Orpheus made the sun rise 'cause he know how to play". The 13th studio album of the alternative rock band [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] is called ''[[Abattoir Blues / The Lyre of Orpheus]]'' (2004), with the initial song of the latter album based around a satirical reworking of the legend, viewed from a more modern male/female perspective. Folk artist [[Anaïs Mitchell]]'s fourth studio album ''[[Hadestown]]'' (2010) is loosely based on the story of Orpheus and Eurydice set in modern times, and was remade into ''[[Hadestown (musical)|Hadestown, The Myth, The Musical]]'' in 2016. [[Peter Blegvad]] and [[Andy Partridge]] created a music and spoken-word recording, ''Orpheus the Lowdown''. Composer [[Judge Smith]] based his songstory ''Orfeas'' (2011) on the ancient myth of Orpheus. Multi-instrumentalist [[Andrew Bird]]'s song "Orpheo Looks Back" from his 2012 album ''[[Break It Yourself]]'' references the myth. In their 2013 album ''[[Reflektor]]'', [[Arcade Fire]] allude to the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice in their songs "Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice)" and "It's Never Over (Hey Orpheus)". The album cover also depicts [[Auguste Rodin]]'s sculpture of Orpheus and Eurydice.

===Reception of the reception===
Because of the pervasiveness of the Orpheus myth, many interpretations are in conversation with previous interpretations as well: [[Pina Bausch]]'s dance-opera ''Orpheus und Euridike'' displays original choreography set to Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice''. [[Baz Luhrmann]], in DVD commentaries for his 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', characterizes the film as, in part, a tale of an Orphic hero (in this case a songwriter) who embarks upon a visit to the underworld (in this case the [[demi-monde]] around Paris' [[Montmartre]]) in search of his fortune and ultimately to attempt the rescue of his doomed love.{{Cite quote|date=October 2017}} The film adapts a widely known piece from [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s comedic operetta ''Orphée aux enfers'' (''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]''), identified with the once-popular [[can-can]] music hall dance. Offenbach's operatic work had itself parodied the classical tale of Orpheus' attempted rescue of Eurydice from Pluto (Hades). [[Gavin Bryars]]' music for [[Édouard Lock]]'s full length ballet ''Dido and Orfeo'' (2011) reworks music from the operas ''Dido and Aeneas'' (Purcell) and ''Orfeo ed Euridice'' (Gluck) for a small ensemble of saxophone, viola, cello and piano.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

'''Renewable energy commercialization''' involves the [[Diffusion of innovations|deployment]] of three generations of [[renewable energy]] technologies dating back more than 100 years. First-generation technologies, which are already mature and economically competitive, include [[biomass]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[geothermal power]] and heat. Second-generation technologies are market-ready and are being deployed at the present time; they include [[solar heating]], [[photovoltaics]], [[wind power]], [[List of solar thermal power stations|solar thermal power stations]], and modern forms of [[bioenergy]]. Third-generation technologies require continued [[R&amp;D]] efforts in order to make large contributions on a global scale and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]].&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;[[International Energy Agency]] (2007).

Renewable energy continued its rapid growth in 2015, providing multiple benefits. There was a new record set for installed wind and photovoltaic capacity (64GW and 57GW) and a new high of US$329 Billion for global renewables investment. A key benefit that this investment growth brings is a growth in jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, [http://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy201611 Green Gold], ''Nature Energy'', 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The top countries for investment in recent years were China, Germany, Spain, the United States, Italy, and Brazil.&lt;ref name="map.ren21.net"&gt;REN21 (2012).

=== Rationale for renewables ===
[[Climate change]], pollution, and energy insecurity are significant problems, and addressing them requires major changes to energy infrastructures.&lt;ref name=WWS2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/JDEnPolicyPt1.pdf
|title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renewable energy]] technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to [[energy security|world energy security]], reduce dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s, and provide opportunities for mitigating [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt; Climate-disrupting [[fossil fuels]] are being replaced by clean, climate-stabilizing, non-depletable sources of energy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{clear}}
...the transition from coal, oil, and gas to wind, solar, and geothermal energy is well under way. In the old economy, energy was produced by burning something — oil, coal, or natural gas — leading to the carbon emissions that have come to define our economy. The new energy economy harnesses the energy in wind, the energy coming from the sun, and heat from within the earth itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lester R. Brown]]. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization'', [[Earth Policy Institute]], 2009, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for a variety of methods for addressing the problem of energy supply. These methods include promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, requiring utilities to use more renewable energy, and providing tax incentives to encourage the development and use of such technologies. It is expected that renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/public_opinion |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517214450/http://www.cfr.org/public_opinion |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 May 2016 |title=Public Opinion on Global Issues: Chapter 5b: World Opinion on Energy Security |author=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |date=18 January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EU member countries have shown support for ambitious renewable energy goals. In 2010, [[Eurobarometer]] polled the twenty-seven EU member states about the target "to increase the share of renewable energy in the EU by 20 percent by 2020". Most people in all twenty-seven countries either approved of the target or called for it to go further. Across the EU, 57 percent thought the proposed goal was "about right" and 16 percent thought it was "too modest." In comparison, 19 percent said it was "too ambitious".&lt;ref name="worldpublicopinion.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/btenvironmentra/707.php |title=Large Majorities in US and Europe Endorse Focus on Renewable Energy |date=18 January 2012 |work=World Public Opinion |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315003300/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/btenvironmentra/707.php |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources, and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny, with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants, particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages. Events at the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear plant]] have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term. Further, cost estimates for "next generation" nuclear units continue to climb, and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilsocietyinstitute.org/media/pdfs/Toward%20a%20Sustainable%20Future%2011-16-11.pdf |title=Toward a Sustainable Future for the U.S. Power Sector: Beyond Business as Usual 2011 |author=Synapse Energy Economics |date=16 November 2011 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2014 [[REN21]] Global Status Report says that renewable energies are no longer just energy sources, but ways to address pressing social, political, economic and environmental problems:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today, renewables are seen not only as sources of energy, but also as tools to address many other pressing needs, including: improving energy security; reducing the health and environmental impacts associated with fossil and nuclear energy; mitigating greenhouse gas emissions; improving educational opportunities; creating jobs; reducing poverty; and increasing gender equality... Renewables have entered the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf  |title= Renewables 2014 Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |date=2014 |work=(Paris: REN21 Secretariat) |isbn=978-3-9815934-2-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Growth of renewables===
[[File:Bp world energy consumption 2016.gif|thumb|Comparing trends in worldwide energy use, the growth of renewable energy to 2015 is the green line&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview Statistical Review of World Energy], Workbook (xlsx), London, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 2008 for the first time, more renewable energy than conventional power capacity was added in both the European Union and United States, demonstrating a "fundamental transition" of the world's energy markets towards renewables, according to a report released by [[REN21]], a global renewable energy policy network based in Paris.&lt;ref name=Mart/&gt; In 2010, renewable power consisted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities.&lt;ref name="UNEP_GT_2011_Fig24"&gt;[http://www.fs-unep-centre.org/publications/global-trends-renewable-energy-investment-2011 UNEP, Bloomberg, Frankfurt School, Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101180801/http://fs-unep-centre.org/publications/global-trends-renewable-energy-investment-2011 |date=1 November 2011 }}、Figure 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2011, total renewable power capacity worldwide exceeded 1,360 GW, up 8%. Renewables producing electricity accounted for almost half of the 208 GW of capacity added globally during 2011. Wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) accounted for almost 40% and 30% .&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.map.ren21.net/GSR/GSR2012.pdf  Renewables 2012 Global status report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215215616/http://www.map.ren21.net/GSR/GSR2012.pdf |date=15 December 2012 }} Executive summary REN21&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[REN21]]'s 2014 report, renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass.&lt;ref name="ria21-GSR2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |title=Renewables 2014: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SKF06GAX?url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/0/documents/Resources/GSR/2014/GSR2014_full%20report_low%20res.pdf |archivedate=4 September 2014 |year=2014 |pages=13, 17, 21, 25 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the five-years from the end of 2004 through 2009, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10–60 percent annually for many technologies, while actual production grew 1.2% overall.&lt;ref&gt;http://fs-unep-centre.org/sites/default/files/media/sefi2011finallowres.pdf pg25graph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ren15&gt;[[REN21]] (2010).

The combination of government target-setting, policy support and stimulus funds is underpinning the renewable industry's rise and bringing the much needed transformation of our global energy system within reach." He added: "Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment, projects and geographical spread. In doing so, they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change, countering energy poverty and energy insecurity".&lt;ref name=invest2011/&gt;

According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency, solar power plants may produce most of the world's electricity within 50 years, significantly reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment. The IEA has said: "Photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world's demand for electricity by 2060 – and half of all energy needs – with wind, hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation". "Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity".&lt;ref name="ieaiea2011"/&gt;

In 2013, China led the world in [[renewable energy]] production, with a total capacity of 378 [[Gigawatt|GW]], mainly from [[hydroelectric]] and [[wind power]]. As of 2014, China leads the world in the production and use of wind power, [[solar power|solar photovoltaic power]] and [[smart grid]] technologies, generating almost as much water, wind and [[solar energy]] as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its [[fossil fuels]] and [[nuclear power]] capacity. Since 2005, production of [[solar cells]] in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.&lt;ref name=chinaen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/economics-manufacture-renewables-to-build-energy-security-1.15847 |title=Economics: Manufacture renewables to build energy security |author1=John A.

===Economic trends===
[[File:US projected cost of wind power.png|thumb|The [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] projects that the levelized cost of wind power will decline about 25% from 2012 to 2030.&lt;ref name=review&gt;E. Lantz, M. Hand, and R. Wiser ( 13–17 May 2012) [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/54526.pdf "The Past and Future Cost of Wind Energy,"] National Renewable Energy Laboratory conference paper no. 6A20-54526, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper, through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition. A 2011 IEA report said: "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," and added that "cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue."&lt;ref name=henning&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/23/us-energy-iea-renewables-idUSTRE7AM0OV20111123 |title=Renewable energy becoming cost competitive, IEA says |author=Henning Gloystein |date=23 November 2011  |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}}, there have been substantial reductions in the cost of solar and wind technologies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{clear}}
The price of PV modules per MW has fallen by 60 percent since the summer of 2008, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates, putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries. Wind turbine prices have also fallen – by 18 percent per MW in the last two years – reflecting, as with solar, fierce competition in the supply chain. Further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar, wind and other technologies lie ahead, posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years.&lt;ref name=invest2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/08/renewables-investment-breaks-records |title=Renewables Investment Breaks Records |date=29 August 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hydro-electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity. Renewable energy costs continue to drop, and the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is declining for wind power, solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP) and some biomass technologies.&lt;ref name=irena111&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/Overview_Renewable%20Power%20Generation%20Costs%20in%202012.pdf |title=Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2012: An Overview |author=International Renewable Energy Agency |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources. As the cost of renewable power falls, the scope of economically viable applications increases. Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity. Where "oil-fired generation is the predominant power generation source (e.g. on islands, off-grid and in some countries) a lower-cost renewable solution almost always exists today".&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt; As of 2012, renewable power generation technologies accounted for around half of all new power generation capacity additions globally. In 2011, additions included 41 [[gigawatt]] (GW) of new wind power capacity, 30 GW of PV, 25 GW of hydro-electricity, 6 GW of biomass, 0.5 GW of CSP, and 0.1 GW of geothermal power.&lt;ref name=irena111/&gt;

=== Three generations of technologies ===
Renewable energy includes a number of sources and technologies at different stages of commercialization. The [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) has defined three generations of renewable energy technologies, reaching back over 100&amp;nbsp;years:

*"''First-generation technologies'' emerged from the [[industrial revolution]] at the end of the 19th century and include [[hydropower]], [[biomass]] [[combustion]], [[geothermal power]] and heat. These technologies are quite widely used.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;
*''Second-generation technologies'' include [[solar heating]] and cooling, [[wind power]], modern forms of [[bioenergy]], and [[solar photovoltaics]]. These are now entering markets as a result of research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by [[energy security]] concerns linked to the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crises]] of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;
*''Third-generation technologies'' are still under development and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[biorefinery]] technologies, concentrating [[solar thermal]] power, [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]]. Advances in [[nanotechnology]] may also play a major role".&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt; First-generation technologies are well established, second-generation technologies are entering markets, and third-generation technologies heavily depend on long-term research and development commitments, where the public sector has a role to play.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;

== First-generation technologies ==
[[File:Biomasseheizwerk Spillern Nordansicht.jpg|thumb|rechts|Biomass heating plant in Austria. The total heat power is about 1000 kW.]]

First-generation technologies are widely used in locations with abundant resources. Their future use depends on the exploration of the remaining resource potential, particularly in developing countries, and on overcoming challenges related to the environment and social acceptance.

=== Biomass ===

[[Biomass]] for heat and power is a fully [[mature technology]] which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One of the problems of biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===
[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|thumb| The 22,500 [[Megawatt|MW]] [[Three Gorges Dam]] in the [[People's Republic of China]], the largest hydroelectric power station in the world.]]
[[Hydroelectricity]] is the term referring to electricity generated by [[hydropower]]; the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. [[Hydroelectric]] plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of hydroelectricity is low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt;

=== Geothermal power and heat ===
[[File:West Ford Flat Geothermal Cooling Tower.JPG|thumb|right|West Ford Flat Geothermal Cooling Tower.JPG|thumb|One of many power plants at [[The Geysers]], a geothermal power field in northern California, with a total output of over 750&amp;nbsp;MW]]

[[Geothermal power]] plants can operate 24&amp;nbsp;hours per day, providing [[baseload]] capacity. Estimates for the world potential capacity for geothermal power generation vary widely, ranging from 40 GW by 2020 to as much as 6,000 GW.&lt;ref&gt;

Geothermal (ground source) heat pumps represented an estimated 30 GWth of installed capacity at the end of 2008, with other direct uses of geothermal heat (i.e., for space heating, agricultural drying and other uses) reaching an estimated 15 GWth. {{As of|2008}}, at least 76 countries use direct geothermal energy in some form.&lt;ref name=renewables/&gt;

== Second-generation technologies ==

Second-generation technologies have gone from being a passion for the dedicated few to a major economic sector in countries such as Germany, Spain, the United States, and Japan. Many large industrial companies and financial institutions are involved and the challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNEP2 /&gt;

=== Solar heating ===
[[File:Solar heater dsc00632.jpg|thumb|Solar energy technologies, such as [[solar water heater]]s, located on or near the buildings which they supply with energy, are a prime example of a [[soft energy technology]].]]
{{See also|Solar hot water}}

[[Solar heating]] systems are a well known second-generation technology and generally consist of [[solar thermal collector]]s, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Norton (2011) Solar Water Heaters: A Review of Systems Research and Design Innovation, Green. 1, 189–207, ISSN (Online) 1869–8778&lt;/ref&gt; The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency. [http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html Solar assisted air-conditioning of buildings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091415/http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html |date=5 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many warmer climates, a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage (50 to 75%) of domestic hot water energy. {{As of|2009}}, China has 27 million rooftop solar water heaters.&lt;ref&gt;Lester R. Brown. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization'', Earth Policy Institute, 2009, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photovoltaics ===

[[File:Solar-crop.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] speaks at the [[DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center]].]]

Photovoltaic (PV) cells, also called [[solar cell]]s, convert light into electricity. In the 1980s and early 1990s, most photovoltaic modules were used to provide [[remote-area power supply]], but from around 1995, industry efforts have focused increasingly on developing [[building integrated photovoltaics]] and [[photovoltaic power station]]s for grid connected applications.

Many solar [[photovoltaic power station]]s have been built, mainly in Europe.&lt;ref name="PV"&gt;Denis Lenardic. [http://www.pvresources.com/en/top50pv.php Large-scale photovoltaic power plants ranking 1 – 50] ''PVresources.com'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2012, the largest photovoltaic (PV) power plants in the world are the [[Agua Caliente Solar Project]] (USA, 247 MW)&lt;!--possibly AC--&gt;, [[Charanka Solar Park]] (India, 214 MW), [[Golmud Solar Park]] (China, 200 MW), [[Perovo Solar Park]] (Russia 100 MW), [[Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant]] (Canada, 97 MW), [[Brandenburg-Briest Solarpark]] (Germany 91 MW), [[Solarpark Finow Tower]] (Germany 84.7 MW), [[Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station]] (Italy, 84.2 MW), [[Eggebek Solar Park]] (Germany 83.6 MW), [[Senftenberg Solarpark]] (Germany 82 MW), [[Finsterwalde Solar Park]] (Germany, 80.7 MW), [[Okhotnykovo Solar Park]] (Russia, 80&amp;nbsp;MW), [[Lopburi Solar Farm]] (Thailand 73.16 MW), [[Rovigo Photovoltaic Power Plant]] (Italy, 72 MW), and the [[Lieberose Photovoltaic Park]] (Germany, 71.8&amp;nbsp;MW).&lt;ref name="PV"/&gt;

There are also many large plants under construction. The [[Desert Sunlight Solar Farm]] under construction in [[Riverside County, California]] and [[Topaz Solar Farm]] being built in [[San Luis Obispo County, California]] are both 550 [[megawatt|MW]] [[solar park]]s that will use thin-film solar [[photovoltaic]] modules made by [[First Solar]].&lt;ref name=rew11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/09/doe-closes-on-three-major-solar-projects |title=DOE Closes on Four Major Solar Projects  |date= 30 September 2011 |work= Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blythe Solar Power Project]] is a 500 MW photovoltaic station under construction in [[Riverside County, California]].

As of 2014, the wind industry in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/business/energy-environment/wind-industrys-new-technologies-are-helping-it-compete-on-price.html?_r=0 |title=Wind Industry's New Technologies Are Helping It Compete on Price |author=Diane Cardwell |date=20 March 2014 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://images1.americanprogress.org/il80web20037/americanenergynow/AmericanEnergy.pdf ''American energy: The renewable path to energy security'' (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction, operations, and maintenance, mostly in rural communities. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, "the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 U.S. jobs in 2005 alone, boosting household income by $5.7&amp;nbsp;billion. It also contributed about $3.5&amp;nbsp;billion in tax revenues at the local, state, and federal levels".&lt;ref name="world" /&gt;

== Third-generation technologies ==

Third-generation renewable energy technologies are still under development and include advanced [[biomass gasification]], [[biorefinery]] technologies, [[hot-dry-rock]] geothermal power, and [[ocean energy]]. Third-generation technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization. Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research and development funding.&lt;ref name="IEA" /&gt;

According to the International Energy Agency, [[cellulosic ethanol]] biorefineries could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in the future than organizations such as the IEA previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;

International Energy Agency (2006). [http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2006/weo2006.pdf ''World Energy Outlook 2006'' (PDF)].

&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as [[Corn stover|corn stalks]], wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and [[municipal solid waste]] are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as [[Panicum virgatum|switchgrass]], are also promising cellulose sources that can be [[Sustainable biofuel|sustainably produced]] in many regions.&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology Industry Organization (2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060212025744/http://www.bio.org/ind/biofuel/CellulosicEthanolIssueBrief.pdf ''Industrial Biotechnology Is Revolutionizing the Production of Ethanol Transportation Fuel''] pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ocean energy ===

[[Ocean energy]] is all forms of renewable energy derived from the sea including wave energy, tidal energy, river current, ocean current energy, offshore wind, salinity gradient energy and ocean thermal gradient energy.&lt;ref name=OE1&gt;[http://oceanenergy.epri.com/ ''Ocean energy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031162616/http://oceanenergy.epri.com/ |date=31 October 2012 }} EPRI Ocean Energy Web Page&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rance Tidal Power Station]] (240 MW) is the world's first [[tidal power|tidal]] power station. The facility is located on the estuary of the [[Rance River]], in [[Brittany]], France. Opened on 26 November 1966, it is currently operated by [[Électricité de France]], and is the largest tidal power station in the world, in terms of installed capacity.

First proposed more than thirty years ago, systems to harvest utility-scale electrical power from ocean waves have recently been gaining momentum as a viable technology. The potential for this technology is considered promising, especially on west-facing coasts with latitudes between 40 and 60 degrees:&lt;ref name=je&gt;Jeff Scruggs and Paul Jacob. Harvesting Ocean Wave Energy, ''Science'', Vol. 323, 27 February 2009, p. 1176.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the United Kingdom, for example, the Carbon Trust recently estimated the extent of the economically viable offshore resource at 55 TWh per year, about 14% of current national demand. Across Europe, the technologically achievable resource has been estimated to be at least 280 TWh per year. In 2003, the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimated the viable resource in the United States at 255 TWh per year (6% of demand).&lt;ref name=je/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There are currently nine projects, completed or in-development, off the coasts of the United Kingdom, United States, Spain and Australia to harness the rise and fall of waves by [[Ocean Power Technologies]]. The current maximum power output is 1.5 MW ([[Reedsport, Oregon]]), with development underway for 100 MW ([[Coos Bay, Oregon]]).&lt;ref name=OPT&gt;[http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/projects.html ''Projects''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401203800/http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/projects.html |date=1 April 2012 }} Ocean Power Technologies Projects&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enhanced geothermal systems ===

{{As of|2008}}, geothermal power development was under way in more than 40 countries, partially attributable to the development of new technologies, such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems.&lt;ref name=renewables&gt;[[REN21]] (2009). [http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2009_update.pdf Renewables Global Status Report: 2009 Update] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612132038/http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2009_update.pdf |date=12 June 2009 }} pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[binary cycle power plant]]s and improvements in drilling and extraction technology may enable [[enhanced geothermal systems]] over a much greater geographical range than "traditional" Geothermal systems. Demonstration EGS projects are operational in the USA, Australia, Germany, France, and The United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Advanced solar concepts ===
Beyond the already established [[solar photovoltaics]] and solar thermal power technologies are such advanced solar concepts as the solar updraft tower or space-based solar power. These concepts have yet to (if ever) be commercialized.  
{{See also|Solar updraft tower}}
The Solar updraft tower (SUT) is a [[Renewable energy|renewable-energy]] [[power plant]] for generating electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall [[chimney]] tower. The resulting [[convection]] causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the [[chimney effect]]. This airflow drives [[wind turbine]]s placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce [[electricity]]. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.

A more advanced version of a similarly themed technology is the [[Vortex engine]] (AVE) which aims to replace large physical chimneys with a [[vortex]] of air created by a shorter, less-expensive structure.
{{See also|Space-based solar power}}
'''Space-based solar power''' ('''SBSP''') is the concept of collecting [[solar power]] in [[Outer space|space]] (using an "SPS", that is, a "solar-power satellite" or a "satellite power system") for use on [[Earth]]. It has been in research since the early 1970s. SBSP would differ from current [[Sun|solar]] collection methods in that the means used to collect [[energy]] would reside on an [[orbit]]ing [[satellite]] instead of on Earth's surface. Some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing [[atmosphere]] and night [[time]] in [[space]].

=== Wind power companies ===
{{See also|Wind power industry}}

{{As of|2010}}, [[Vestas]] (from Denmark) is the world's top wind turbine manufacturer in terms of percentage of market volume, and [[Sinovel]] (from China) is in second place. Together Vestas and Sinovel delivered 10,228 MW of new wind power capacity in 2010, and their market share was 25.9 percent. [[GE Energy]] (USA) was in third place, closely followed by [[Goldwind]], another Chinese supplier. German [[Enercon]] ranks fifth in the world, and is followed in sixth place by Indian-based [[Suzlon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/08/world-wind-market-record-installations-but-growth-rates-still-falling |title=World Wind Market: Record Installations, But Growth Rates Still Falling |author=Tildy Bayar |date=4 August 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PV industry has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of [[grid parity]] for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.&lt;ref name=reconsidering&gt;{{cite web |url= http://az2112.com/assets/energy-bnef_re_considering_the_economics_of_photovoltaic_power_a_co_authored_white.pdf |title= Re-considering the economics of photovoltaic power |author1=M Bazilian |author2=I Onyeji |author3=M Liebreich |author4=I MacGill |author5=J Chase |author6=J Shah |author7=D Gielen... |date=  2013 |work=Renewable Energy (53) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-technical barriers to acceptance ==
Many energy markets, institutions, and policies have been developed to support the production and use of fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=jacob2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part II: Reliability, System and Transmission Costs, and Policies |author=Delucchi, Mark A. and [[Mark Z. Jacobson]]  |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy }}

&lt;/ref&gt; Newer and cleaner technologies may offer social and environmental benefits, but utility operators often reject renewable resources because they are trained to think only in terms of big, conventional power plants.&lt;ref name=epsov/&gt; Consumers often ignore renewable power systems because they are not given accurate price signals about electricity consumption. Intentional market distortions (such as subsidies), and unintentional market distortions (such as split incentives) may work against renewables.&lt;ref name=epsov&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool. "Rejecting Renewables: The Socio-technical Impediments to Renewable Electricity in the United States," ''Energy Policy'', 37(11) (November 2009), p. 4500.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] has argued that "some of the most surreptitious, yet powerful, impediments facing renewable energy and energy efficiency in the United States are more about ''culture'' and ''institutions'' than engineering and science".&lt;ref&gt;
Benjamin K. Sovacool. "The Cultural Barriers to Renewable Energy in the United States," ''Technology in Society'', 31(4) (November 2009), p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

The obstacles to the widespread commercialization of renewable energy technologies are primarily political, not technical,&lt;ref&gt;
Mark Z. Jacobson and Mark A. Delucchi. A Path to Sustainable Energy by 2030, ''Scientific American'', November 2009, p. 45.
&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been many studies which have identified a range of "non-technical barriers" to renewable energy use.&lt;ref name=ieapress/&gt;&lt;ref name="NREL"&gt;[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (2006). ''Nontechnical Barriers to Solar Energy Use: Review of Recent Literature'', Technical Report, NREL/TP-520-40116, September, 30 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GREMS&gt;
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, (2005). [http://www.ppre.uni-oldenburg.de/download/Downloads/Global_RE-Report-2005.pdf Increasing Global Renewable Energy Market Share: Recent Trends and Perspectives] Final Report.&lt;/ref&gt; These barriers are impediments which put renewable energy at a marketing, institutional, or policy disadvantage relative to other forms of energy. Key barriers include:&lt;ref name="NREL" /&gt;&lt;ref name=GREMS /&gt;

* Difficulty overcoming established energy systems, which includes difficulty introducing innovative energy systems, particularly for [[distributed generation]] such as photovoltaics, because of technological lock-in, electricity markets designed for centralized power plants, and market control by established operators. As the [[Stern Review|Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change]] points out:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"National grids are usually tailored towards the operation of centralised power plants and thus favour their performance. Technologies that do not easily fit into these networks may struggle to enter the market, even if the technology itself is commercially viable. This applies to distributed generation as most grids are not suited to receive electricity from many small sources. Large-scale renewables may also encounter problems if they are sited in areas far from existing grids."&lt;ref name=Stern2&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

HM Treasury (2006). [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change''] p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Lack of government policy support, which includes the lack of policies and regulations supporting deployment of renewable energy technologies and the presence of policies and regulations hindering renewable energy development and supporting conventional energy development. Examples include [[fossil fuel subsidies|subsidies for fossil-fuels]], insufficient consumer-based [[renewable energy incentives]], government underwriting for nuclear plant accidents, and complex zoning and permitting processes for renewable energy.
* Lack of information dissemination and consumer awareness.
* Higher capital cost of renewable energy technologies compared with conventional energy technologies.
* Inadequate financing options for renewable energy projects, including insufficient access to affordable financing for project developers, entrepreneurs and consumers.
* Imperfect capital markets, which includes failure to internalize all costs of conventional energy (e.g., effects of air pollution, risk of supply disruption)&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald.
[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/science/earth/20fossil.html Fossil Fuels’ Hidden Cost Is in Billions, Study Says] ''The New York Times'', 20 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and failure to internalize all benefits of renewable energy (e.g., cleaner air, energy security).
* Inadequate workforce skills and training, which includes lack of adequate scientific, technical, and manufacturing skills required for renewable energy production; lack of reliable installation, maintenance, and inspection services; and failure of the educational system to provide adequate training in new technologies.
* Lack of adequate codes, standards, utility interconnection, and net-metering guidelines.
* Poor public perception of renewable energy system aesthetics.
* Lack of stakeholder/community participation and co-operation in energy choices and renewable energy projects.

With such a wide range of non-technical barriers, there is no "silver bullet" solution to drive the transition to renewable energy. So ideally there is a need for several different types of policy instruments to complement each other and overcome different types of barriers.&lt;ref name=GREMS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

A policy framework must be created that will level the playing field and redress the imbalance of traditional approaches associated with fossil fuels. The policy landscape must keep pace with broad trends within the energy sector, as well as reflecting specific social, economic and environmental priorities.&lt;ref&gt;IEA Renewable Energy Working Party (2002). ''Renewable Energy... into the mainstream'', p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some resource-rich countries struggle to move away from fossil fuels and have failed thus far to adopt regulatory frameworks necessary for developing renewable energy (e.g. Russia).&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland, ‘The Siberian Curse: A Blessing in Disguise for Renewable Energy?’, Sibirica Journal of Siberian Studies, Vol. 9, No. 2, pp. 1-20. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263524693&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public policy landscape ==
Public policy has a role to play in renewable energy commercialization because the free market system has some fundamental limitations. As the [[Stern Review]] points out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a liberalised energy market, investors, operators and consumers should face the full cost of their decisions. But this is not the case in many economies or energy sectors. Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies.&lt;ref name=Stern2 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[International Solar Energy Society]] has stated that "historical incentives for the conventional energy resources continue even today to bias markets by burying many of the real societal costs of their use".&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Aitken. [http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/downloads/ Transitioning to a Renewable Energy Future], [[International Solar Energy Society]], January 2010, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossil-fuel energy systems have different production, transmission, and end-use costs and characteristics than do renewable energy systems, and new promotional policies are needed to ensure that renewable systems develop as quickly and broadly as is socially desirable.&lt;ref name=jacob2010/&gt;

[[Lester Brown]] states that the market "does not incorporate the indirect costs of providing goods or services into prices, it does not value nature's services adequately, and it does not respect the sustainable-yield thresholds of natural systems".&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt; It also favors the near term over the long term, thereby showing limited concern for future generations.&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;

=== Shifting taxes ===
Tax shifting has been widely discussed and endorsed by economists. It involves lowering income taxes while raising levies on environmentally destructive activities, in order to create a more responsive market. For example, a tax on coal that included the increased health care costs associated with breathing polluted air, the costs of acid rain damage, and the costs of climate disruption would encourage investment in renewable technologies. Several Western European countries are already shifting taxes in a process known there as environmental tax reform.&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

In 2001, Sweden launched a new 10-year environmental tax shift designed to convert 30&amp;nbsp;billion kroner ($3.9&amp;nbsp;billion) of income taxes to taxes on environmentally destructive activities. Other European countries with significant tax reform efforts are France, Italy, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Asia's two leading economies, Japan and China, are considering carbon taxes.&lt;ref name="Br" /&gt;

=== Shifting subsidies ===

Just as there is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an inherently bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30&amp;nbsp;years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded.&lt;ref&gt;HM Treasury (2006). [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm ''Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change''] p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

Lester Brown has argued that "a world facing the prospect of economically disruptive climate change can no longer justify subsidies to expand the burning of coal and oil. Shifting these subsidies to the development of climate-benign energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal power is the key to stabilizing the earth's climate."&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; The International Solar Energy Society advocates "leveling the playing field" by redressing the continuing inequities in public subsidies of energy technologies and R&amp;D, in which the fossil fuel and nuclear power receive the largest share of financial support.&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Aitken. [http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/downloads/ Transitioning to a Renewable Energy Future], [[International Solar Energy Society]], January 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries are eliminating or reducing climate-disrupting subsidies and Belgium, France, and Japan have phased out all subsidies for coal. Germany is reducing its coal subsidy. The subsidy dropped from $5.4&amp;nbsp;billion in 1989 to $2.8&amp;nbsp;billion in 2002, and in the process Germany lowered its coal use by 46&amp;nbsp;percent. China cut its coal subsidy from $750&amp;nbsp;million in 1993 to $240&amp;nbsp;million in 1995 and more recently has imposed a high-sulfur coal tax.&lt;ref name="Brown"  /&gt; However, the United States has been increasing its support for the fossil fuel and nuclear industries.&lt;ref name="Brown"  /&gt;

In November 2011, an IEA report entitled ''[[Deploying Renewables 2011]]'' said "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand.&lt;ref name="henning"/&gt;

A fair and efficient imposition of subsidies for renewable energies and aiming at sustainable development, however, require coordination and regulation at a global level, as subsidies granted in one country can easily disrupt industries and policies of others, thus underlining the relevance of this issue at the World Trade Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Cima|first2=Elena|title=World Trade Organization, Renewable Energy Subsidies and the Case of Feed-In Tariffs: Time for Reform Toward Sustainable Development?|journal=Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (GIELR)|date=2015|volume= 27|issue= 1|ssrn=2704398|accessdate=}} and {{cite journal|title=WTO and Renewable Energy: Lessons from the Case Law|journal=49 JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE 6, Kluwer Law International|ssrn=2704453|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renewable energy targets ===
Setting national renewable energy targets can be an important part of a renewable energy policy and these targets are usually defined as a percentage of the primary energy and/or electricity generation mix. For example, the [[European Union]] has prescribed an indicative renewable energy target of 12 per cent of the total EU [[energy mix]] and 22 per cent of electricity consumption by 2010. National targets for individual EU Member States have also been set to meet the overall target. Other developed countries with defined national or regional targets include Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, and some US States.&lt;ref name=UNEP3&gt;United Nations Environment Program (2006).  [http://www.ren21.net/pdf/REN21CC%20rapport.pdf ''Changing climates: The Role of Renewable Energy in a Carbon-constrained World''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055332/http://www.ren21.net/pdf/REN21CC%20rapport.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }} pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

National targets are also an important component of renewable energy strategies in some [[developing countries]]. Developing countries with renewable energy targets include China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, Egypt, Mali, and South Africa. The targets set by many developing countries are quite modest when compared with those in some industrialized countries.&lt;ref name=UNEP3 /&gt;

Renewable energy targets in most countries are indicative and nonbinding but they have assisted government actions and regulatory frameworks. The United Nations Environment Program has suggested that making renewable energy targets legally binding could be an important policy tool to achieve higher renewable energy market penetration.&lt;ref name=UNEP3 /&gt;

===Levelling the playing field===
The IEA has identified three actions which will allow renewable energy and other clean energy technologies to "more effectively compete for private sector capital".
*"First, energy prices must appropriately reflect the "true cost" of energy (e.g. through carbon pricing) so that the positive and negative impacts of energy production and consumption are fully taken into account". Example: [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station|New UK nuclear plants]] cost £92.50/MWh,&lt;ref name=bbcstrike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24604218|title=UK nuclear power plant gets go-ahead|date=21 October 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telestrike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/10392510/Hinkley-Point-good-for-Britain-says-Ed-Davey.html|title=Hinkley Point nuclear power plant to create 25,000 jobs, says Cameron|date=21 October 2013|author1=Roland Gribben  |author2=Denise Roland |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher= Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas offshore wind farms in the UK are supported with €74.2/MWh&lt;ref&gt;Erin Gill.

Accessed: 22 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Second, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies must be removed, while ensuring that all citizens have access to affordable energy".
*"Third, governments must develop policy frameworks that encourage private sector investment in lower-carbon energy options".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/IEA%20Tracking%20Clean%20Energy%20Progress%20report%202012.pdf |title=Tracking Clean Energy Progress |author=IEA |year=2012 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green stimulus programs ===
In response to the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|global financial crisis in the late 2000s]], the world's major governments made "green stimulus" programs one of their main policy instruments for supporting economic recovery. Some {{US$|188 billion}} in green stimulus funding had been allocated to renewable energy and energy efficiency, to be spent mainly in 2010 and in 2011.&lt;ref name=ren27&gt;[[REN21]] (2010). [http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf Renewables 2010 Global Status Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820221548/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf |date=20 August 2010 }} p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy sector regulation===
Public policy determines the extent to which renewable energy (RE) is to be incorporated into a developed or developing country's generation mix. Energy sector regulators implement that policy—thus affecting the pace and pattern of RE investments and connections to the grid. Energy regulators often have authority to carry out a number of functions that have implications for the financial feasibility of renewable energy projects. Such functions include issuing licenses, setting performance standards, monitoring the performance of regulated firms, determining the price level and structure of tariffs, establishing uniform systems of accounts, arbitrating stakeholder disputes (like interconnection cost allocations), performing management audits, developing agency human resources (expertise), reporting sector and commission activities to government authorities, and coordinating decisions with other government agencies. Thus, regulators make a wide range of decisions that affect the financial outcomes associated with RE investments. In addition, the sector regulator is in a position to give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security. The energy sector regulator is the natural advocate for efficiency and cost-containment throughout the process of designing and implementing RE policies. Since policies are not self-implementing, energy sector regulators become a key facilitator (or blocker) of renewable energy investments.&lt;ref name="PURC"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, Body of Knowledge on Infrastructure Regulation, [http://regulationbodyofknowledge.org/renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has made significant progress on its GHG emissions reduction target, achieving a 27% decrease between 1990 and 2014.

These initiatives go well beyond [[European Union]] legislation and the national policies of other European states. The policy objectives have been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables, particularly wind power. Germany's share of renewables has increased from around 5% in 1999 to 22.9% in 2012, surpassing the OECD average of 18% usage of renewables.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"&gt;

Producers have been guaranteed a fixed [[feed-in tariff]] for 20 years, guaranteeing a fixed income. Energy co-operatives have been created, and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits. The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market. However, in some cases poor investment designs have caused bankruptcies and low [[Return on investment|returns]], and unrealistic promises have been shown to be far from reality.&lt;ref name="latsch-etal-2014"&gt;

Nuclear power plants were closed, and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned, in 2022.

One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market. It is believed 8,300&amp;nbsp;km of power lines must be built or upgraded.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"/&gt; The different [[States of Germany|German States]] have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the ''Energiewende'' have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills.

== Voluntary market mechanisms for renewable electricity ==
Voluntary markets, also referred to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose to do more than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful. Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/gpmarket/markets.htm |title= Voluntary and mandatory markets |date= 25 March 2013|work= |publisher= United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The driving factors behind voluntary green electricity within the EU are the liberalized electricity markets and the RES Directive. According to the directive, the EU Member States must ensure that the origin of electricity produced from renewables can be guaranteed and therefore a "guarantee of origin" must be issued (article 15). Environmental organisations are using the voluntary market to create new renewables and improving sustainability of the existing power production. In the US the main tool to track and stimulate voluntary actions is Green-e program managed by [[Center for Resource Solutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.green-e.org/about.shtml |title= About Green-e |year= 2013|work= |publisher= Center for Resource Solutions |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe the main voluntary tool used by the NGOs to promote sustainable electricity production is [[EKOenergy]] label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ekoenergy.org/where-can-i-buy-it/questions-and-answers |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130704002836/http://www.ekoenergy.org/where-can-i-buy-it/questions-and-answers |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2013-07-04 |title= Frequently asked questions |date= March 2013 |work=  |publisher= EKOenergy Network |accessdate= 18 April 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of events in 2006 pushed renewable energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed [[clean energy]] as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review&lt;ref name=Stern /&gt; made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environment Programme and New Energy Finance Ltd.

As of 2012, renewable energy plays a major role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for renewable energy technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.&lt;ref&gt;REN21. (2013). ''Renewables 2013 Global Status Report'', (Paris: REN21 Secretariat), {{ISBN|978-3-9815934-0-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

United Nations' Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] has said that "renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/08/u-n-secretary-general-renewables-can-end-energy-poverty |title=U.N.

The group is to be co-chaired by Kandeh Yumkella, the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation, and Charles Holliday, chairman of Bank of America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/nov/02/human-development-report-renewable-energy |title=UN calls for universal access to renewable energy |author=Mark Tran |date=2 November 2011 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide use of solar power and wind power continued to grow significantly in 2012. Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh.&lt;ref name=vitals&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vitalsigns.worldwatch.org/sites/default/files/vital_signs_trend_growth_of_global_solar_and_wind_energy_continues_to_outpace_other_technologies_vital_signs_final_pdf.pdf |title=Growth of Global Solar and Wind Energy Continues to Outpace Other Technologies |author1=Matt Lucky |author2=Michelle Ray |author3=Mark Konold  |last-author-amp=yes |date=30 July 2013  |work=Vital Signs }}&lt;/ref&gt; Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012.

==100% renewable energy==
{{Main article|100% renewable energy}}

The incentive to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by [[global warming]] and other ecological as well as economic concerns. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of the total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111081913/http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |title=100 Percent Renewable Vision Building |author=Paul Gipe |date=4 April 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply.

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]], professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its Atmosphere and Energy Program says producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]], and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.&lt;ref name=enpol2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |author1=Mark A. Delucchi  |author2=Mark Z. Jacobson  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011| volume= 39 |work=Energy Policy |pages=1170–1190 |publisher=Elsevier Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that "sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand."&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|title=Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments  |author=National Research Council| year=2010|pages=4|publisher=National Academies of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 ''Post Carbon Pathways'' report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: [[climate change denial]], the [[fossil fuels lobby]], political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.&lt;ref name="John Wiseman et al"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |title=Post Carbon Pathways |author=John Wiseman |date=April 2013 |work=University of Melbourne |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620031627/http://www.postcarbonpathways.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Post-Carbon-Pathways-Report-2013_Final-V.pdf |archivedate=20 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
{{Main article|Efficient energy use}}

Moving towards energy sustainability will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;

InterAcademy Council (2007). [http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf ''Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128074454/http://www.interacademycouncil.net/Object.File/Master/12/053/Executive%20Summary.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency. Renewable energy and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] are said to be the "twin pillars" of [[sustainable energy]] policy. [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]] has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions:&lt;ref name=am&gt;

American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (2007).
[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429195906/http://www.aceee.org/store/proddetail.cfm?CFID=785209&amp;CFTOKEN=22090724&amp;ItemID=432&amp;CategoryID=7 ''The Twin Pillars of Sustainable Energy: Synergies between Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technology and Policy''] Report E074.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.&lt;ref name=am /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IEA has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future, and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Shock diamonds''' (also known as '''Mach diamonds''', '''Mach disks''',  '''Mach rings''', '''donut tails''' or '''thrust diamonds''') are a formation of [[standing wave]] patterns that appear in the [[supersonic]] [[exhaust plume]] of an aerospace propulsion system, such as a supersonic [[jet engine]], [[rocket]], [[ramjet]], or [[scramjet]], when it is operated in an atmosphere. The diamonds are formed from a complex flow field and are visible due to the abrupt changes in local density and pressure caused by standing [[shock wave]]s.  Mach diamonds (or disks) are named after [[Ernst Mach]], the physicist who first described them.&lt;ref name="Norman.Winkler.1985"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://la-science.lanl.gov/lascience12.shtml | author1=Michael L.

[[File:Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor JSOH.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|An [[F-22 Raptor]] with shock diamonds behind it]]
Shock diamonds form when the supersonic exhaust from a [[propelling nozzle]] is slightly over-expanded, meaning that the [[static pressure#Static pressure in fluid dynamics|static pressure]] of the gases exiting the nozzle is less than the ambient [[air pressure]].  The higher ambient pressure compresses the flow, and since the resulting pressure increase in the exhaust gas stream is [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]], and reduction in velocity causes its static temperature to be substantially increased. This causes reignition of the unburned combustion products in the engine’s exhaust.&lt;ref name=aero&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Jeff|title=Shock Diamonds and Mach Disks|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/propulsion/q0224.shtml|publisher=Aerospaceweb.org|accessdate=6 November 2011|date=17 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhaust is generally over-expanded at low altitudes, where air pressure is higher.

As the flow exits the nozzle, ambient air pressure will compress the flow.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; The external compression is caused by [[oblique shock wave]]s inclined at an angle to the flow. The compressed flow is alternately expanded by [[Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan]]s, and each "diamond" is formed by the pairing of an oblique shock with an expansion fan. When the compressed flow becomes parallel to the center line, a shock wave perpendicular to the flow forms, called a [[normal shock wave]]. The first shock diamond is located here, and the space between it and the nozzle is called the "zone of silence".&lt;ref name=lcms/&gt; The distance from the nozzle to the first shock diamond can be approximated by

:&lt;math&gt;x = 0.67 D_0\sqrt{\frac{P_0}{P_1}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' is the distance, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the nozzle diameter, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is flow pressure, and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref name=lcms&gt;{{cite book|last=Niessen|first=Wilfried M. A.|title=Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry|volume=79|date=1999|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-0-8247-1936-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSnKlgDBzJEC|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the exhaust passes through the normal shock wave, its temperature increases, igniting excess fuel and causing the glow that makes the shock diamonds visible.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; The illuminated regions either appear as disks or [[diamond (shape)|diamond]]s, giving them their name.

Eventually the flow expands enough so that its pressure is again below ambient, at which point the expansion fan reflects from the [[contact discontinuity]] (the outer edge of the flow). The reflected waves, called the [[compression fan]], cause the flow to compress.&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; If the compression fan is strong enough, another oblique shock wave will form, creating a second shock diamond. The pattern of disks would repeat indefinitely if the gases were ideal and frictionless,&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; however, [[turbulent]] shear at the contact discontinuity causes the wave pattern to dissipate with distance.&lt;ref name=fiu&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhaust Gases' Diamond Pattern|url=http://www.allstar.fiu.edu/aero/rocket3.htm|publisher=[[Florida International University]]|accessdate=6 November 2011|date=12 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond patterns can similarly form when a nozzle is under-expanded (exit pressure higher than ambient), in lower atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes. In this case, the expansion fan is first to form, followed by the oblique shock.

Shock diamonds are most commonly associated with jet and rocket propulsion, but they can form in other systems.

===Natural gas pipeline blowdowns===
Shock diamonds can be seen during gas pipeline blowdowns because the gas is under high pressure and exits the blowdown valve at extreme speeds.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Artillery===
When artillery pieces are fired, gas exits the cannon muzzle at supersonic speeds and produces a series of shock diamonds. The diamonds cause a bright [[muzzle flash]] which can expose the location of gun emplacements to the enemy. It was found that when the ratio between the flow pressure and atmospheric pressure is close, the shock diamonds were greatly minimized. Adding a [[muzzle brake]] to the end of the muzzle balances the pressures and prevents shock diamonds.&lt;ref name="Norman.Winkler.1985"/&gt;{{rp|41}}

===Radio jets===
Some [[radio jets]], powerful jets of plasma that emanate from [[quasar]]s and [[radio galaxies]], are observed to have regularly-spaced knots of enhanced radio emissions.&lt;ref name="Norman.Winkler.1985"/&gt;{{rp|68}} The jets travel at supersonic speed through a thin "atmosphere" of gas in space,&lt;ref name="Norman.Winkler.1985"/&gt;{{rp|51}} so it is hypothesized that these knots are shock diamonds.{{cn|reason=the source cites simply discuss the phenomena; they do not support that these are in any way shock diamonds|date=January 2018}}

In [[geology]], '''sima''' is the name for the lower layer of the [[Earth]]'s [[crust (geology)|crust]]. This layer is made of rocks rich in [[magnesium]] [[silicate mineral]]s.  Typically when the sima comes to the surface it is [[basalt]], so sometimes this layer is called the 'basalt layer' of the crust. The sima layer is also called the 'basal crust' or 'basal layer' because it is the lowest layer of the crust.  Because the ocean floors are mainly sima, it is also sometimes called the '[[oceanic crust]]'.

The name 'sima' was taken from the first two letters of [[silica]] and of [[Magnesium oxide|magnesia]]. Comparable is the name '[[sial]]' which is the name for the upper layer of the Earth's [[continental crust]].

==Petrology==
The sima has a higher density (2800 to 3300 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) than the [[sial]], which is due to increased amounts of iron and magnesium, and decreased amounts of aluminium.  When the denser sima comes to the surface it forms [[mafic]] rocks, or rocks with mafic minerals. The most dense sima has less silica and forms [[ultramafic]] rocks.

'''Sinus Fidei''' ([[Latin]] for "Bay of Faith") is a small basaltic [[lunar mare|mare]] feature in the [[Terra Nivium]] region of the [[Moon]].  It is also located more than 45 km west of the prominent [[Yangel']] crater.

The bay lies northwest of [[Mare Vaporum]] which is narrowly linked, a small lies in the middle of that area.  Northeast is the rille known as Rima Conon which runs partly in a zig-zag form.  [[Conon (crater)|Its crater]] is located north of the bay.  Outside the bay, hills dominate the land shore especially to the east, in that location is Conon W, further east is [[Lacus Felicitatis]].

The '''Southwest Amazon moist forests''' (NT0166) is an [[ecoregion]] located in the Upper [[Amazon basin]].

The forest is characterized by a relatively flat landscape with [[alluvial plain]]s dissected by undulating hills or high terraces.&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{cite web | author = World Wildlife Fund | author-link = World Wildlife Fund | editor = Mark McGinley | url = http://www.eoearth.org/article/Southwest_Amazon_moist_forests | title = Southwest Amazon moist forests | work = [[Encyclopedia of Earth]] | date = 26 August 2008 | accessdate = 11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[biota (ecology)|biota]] of the southwest Amazon moist forest is very rich because of these dramatic [[edaphic]] and [[topographical]] variations at both the local and regional levels. This ecoregion has the highest number of both [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s recorded for the Amazonian [[biogeographic]] realm: 257 with 11 [[endemic species]] for mammals and 782 and 17 endemics for [[bird]]s. The inaccessibility of this region, along with few roads, has kept most of the habitat intact. Also, there are a number of protected areas, which preserve this extremely biologically rich ecoregion.

== Location ==
[[File:Buriti.JPG|thumb|''Mauritia flexuosa'', or [[moriche palm]], is an economically important species dominant in some parts of the ecoregion.]]
The southwest Amazon moist forest region covers an extensive area of the Upper Amazon Basin comprising four sub-basins: (1) both the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]]-[[Marañon River|Marañon]] and (2) [[Ucayali River]] sub-basins drain into the Upper [[Amazon River]] in Peru; (3) the [[Acre River|Acre]] and (4) [[Madre de Dios River|Madre de Dios]]-[[Beni River|Beni]] sub-basins drain to the east into the [[Juruá River|Juruá]], [[Purus River|Purus]] and [[Madeira River]]s; which, in turn, feed into the Amazon River lower down in Brazil.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; The region is bisected north to south between Peru and Brazil by the small mountain range [[Serra do Divisor National Park|Serra do Divisor]]. It extends east to the edge of the Purus Arch, or ancient zone of uplift, in the southwestern area of the Brazilian State of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]]. It then extends southeast into northern Bolivia and in a narrow band south along the base of the [[Andes Mountains]]. Elevations range from {{convert|300|m|ft}} in the west to {{convert|100|m|ft}} on the eastern edge of the region.

Landforms present in this region include the upland [[terra firme]] (non-flooded) mostly on nutrient-poor [[laterite|lateritic soils]], ancient [[alluvial plain]]s (mostly non-flooded) on nutrient-rich soils, and present alluvial plains ([[várzea forest|várzea]], seasonally flooded) of super-rich sediments renewed with each annual flood.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; Floristically, distinct lowland humid forest types occur on each of these landforms with the terra firme mature forests and late successional, seasonally flooded forest being the two major types. Permanent [[swamp]] forests are common on the alluvial plains. Pockets of nutrient-poor [[coral sand|white sand]] soils are found here that host forests of lower height, a more open [[forest canopy]], and lower [[alpha diversity]], but with many endemics. The forests are mostly dense [[tropical rain forest]], but some patches of open forest exist.

The ecoregion contains stretches of [[Iquitos várzea]] along the main rivers, blending into [[Purus várzea]] near the eastern border, where it adjoins the [[Juruá-Purus moist forests]] ecoregion. In the southeast it adjoins the [[Purus-Madeira moist forests]] and [[Madeira-Tapajós moist forests]], and in the south merges into the [[Llanos de Moxos]] and [[Bolivian Yungas]]. In the southwest it adjoins the [[Peruvian Yungas]]. To the west it adjoins the [[Ucayali moist forests]]. In the north it is separated by a band of Iquitos varzea from the [[Solimões-Japurá moist forests]].{{sfn|WildFinder – WWF}}

==General description of flora==

Because the ecoregion covers such a vast area, there are climatic, edaphic and floristic differences within it. Generally, the wetter and less seasonal northern forests ({{convert|3000|mm|in}} of rain annually) share only 44 percent of the tree species with forests in the slightly drier, more seasonal southern region. This region receives from {{convert|1500|to|2100|mm|in}} of rain annually, in different parts. Temperatures over the year range from {{convert|22|to|27|C|F}}.

At first glance, large areas may appear to be homogeneous dense forests with a canopy {{convert|30|to|40|m|ft}} high with some emergent trees to {{convert|50|m|ft}} towering above the canopy.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; Structurally, this may be the case; however, the species composition reflects much the opposite: tree species variability reaches upwards to 300 species in a single hectare. There are a few exceptions to this high diversity, mainly where stands dominated by one or several species occur. The first are vast areas (more than {{convert|180000|km2|sqmi}}) dominated by the highly competitive arborescent bamboos ''[[Guadua sarcocarpa]]'' and ''[[Guadua weberbaueri]]'' near Acre, Brazil extending into Peru and Bolivia. Other monodominant stands include swamp forests of the economically important palms ''[[Moriche Palm|Mauritia flexuosa]]'' and ''[[Oenocarpus bataua|Jessenia bataua]]''.

In the north of the region, some of the best known plants yield products of commercial value, such as [[rubber]] (''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]''), [[mahogany]] (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]''), [[balsam wood]] (''[[Myroxylon balsamum]]''), [[timber]] and [[essential oil]] (''[[Amburana acreana]]''), [[tagua nut]] (''[[Phytelephas microcarpa]]''), and [[strychnine]] (''[[Strychnos asperula]]'').&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; An area representative of the southern part of this region, in the north of Bolivia, hosts a seasonal humid high forest to {{convert|35|m|ft}} with some emergents reaching {{convert|40|m|ft}} in height and many buttressed trunks. The largest trees are ''[[Ceiba pentandra]]'', ''[[Poulsenia armata]]'', ''[[Calycophyllum spruceanum]]'', ''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]'', and ''[[Dipteryx odorata]]''. Other trees typical in this area are ''[[Calycophyllum acreanum]]'', ''[[Terminalia amazonica]]'', ''[[Combretum laxum]]'', ''[[Mezilaurus itauba]]'', ''[[Didymopanax morototoni]]'', ''[[Jacaranda copaia]]'', ''[[Aspidosperma megalocarpon]]'', ''[[Vochisia vismiaefolia]]'', ''[[Hirtella lightioides]]'', and ''[[Hura crepitans]]''. Palms include, among others, members of the [[genus|genera]] ''[[Astrocaryum]]'', ''[[Iriartea]]'' and ''[[Sheelea]]'', ''[[Oenocarpus mapora]]'', ''[[Chelyocarpus chuco]]'', ''[[Phytelephas macrocarpa]]'', ''[[Euterpe precatoria]]'', and ''[[Jessenia bataua]]''. [[Lianas]] are common with about 43 species present. Many Amazonian species reach the southern limit of their distribution here. The Brazil nut tree (''[[Bertholletia excelsa]]'') is present in the south, but is likely not native this far west in Amazonia.

==Biodiversity features==
[[File:Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis)-8.jpg|thumb|right|''Leopardus pardalis'', the [[ocelot]], is a [[threatened species]] that finds a home in the southwest Amazon moist forests.]]
What is distinctive about this region is the diversity of habitats created by edaphic, topographic and climatic variability. [[Habitat heterogeneity]], along with a complex geological and climatic history has led to a high cumulative biotic richness. Endemism and overall richness is high in [[vascular plant]]s, [[invertebrate]]s and [[vertebrate]] animals.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; This is the Amazon Basin’s center of diversity for palms. The rare palm ''[[Itaya amicorum]]'' is found on the upper [[Javari River]]. This ecoregion has the highest number of mammals recorded for the Amazonian biogeographic realm: 257 with 11 endemics. Bird richness is also highest here with 782 species and 17 endemics. In the southern part of the [[Tambopata Reserve]], one area that is {{convert|50|km2|sqmi}} holds the record for bird species: 554. On the white sand areas in the north, plants endemic to this soil type include ''[[Jacqueshuberia loretensis]]'', ''[[Ambelania occidentalis]]'', ''[[Spathelia terminalioides]]'', and ''[[Hirtella revillae]]''.

Many widespread Amazonian mammals and reptiles find a home in this region.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; These include [[tapir]]s (''[[Tapirus terrestris]]''), [[jaguar]]s (''[[Panthera onca]]''), the world’s largest living rodents, [[capybara]]s (''[[Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris]]''), [[kinkajou]]s (''[[Potos flavus]]''), and white-lipped peccaries (''[[Tayassu pecari]]''). Some of the globally threatened animals found in this region include black caimans (''[[Melanosuchus niger]]'') and spectacled caimans (''[[Caiman crocodilus crocodilus]]''), woolly monkeys (''[[Lagothrix lagotricha]]''), giant otters (''[[Pteronura brasiliensis]]''), giant anteaters (''[[Myrmecophaga tridactyla]]''), and ocelots (''[[Leopardus pardalis]]'').

Pygmy marmosets (''[[Cebuella pygmaea]]''), Goeldi marmosets (''[[Callimico goeldii]]''), pacaranas (''[[Dinomys branickii]]''), and eastern lowland olingos (''[[Bassaricyon alleni]]'') are found here, but not in regions to the east.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;&lt;ref name=ZooKeys&gt;{{cite journal |title=Taxonomic revision of the olingos (''Bassaricyon''), with description of a new species, the Olinguito  |last1=Helgen |first1=K.

The rare red uakari monkeys (''[[Cacajao calvus]]'') are found in the north in swamp forests. Nocturnal two-toed sloths (''[[Choloepus hoffmanni]]'') are well distributed throughout this region along with the widespread three-toes sloths (''[[Bradypus variegatus]]''). The Amazon River is a barrier to a number of animals such as the tamarins ''[[Saguinus nigricollis]]'', which occur on the north side, and ''[[Saguinus mystax]]'', which occurs on the southwest side of the Amazon-Ucayali system.

In the region of Manu, 68 species of reptiles and 68 species of amphibians have been reported for the lowland areas while 113 species of amphibians and 118 species of reptiles are reported from Madre de Dios, including the rare and interesting pit-vipers (''[[Bothrops bilineatus]]'', ''[[Bothrops brazili]]''), and frogs such as ''[[Dendrophidion sp.]]'', ''[[Rhadinaea occipitalis]]'', and ''[[Xenopholis scalaris]]''.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt;

==Current status==
[[File:Manu riverbank.jpg|thumb|left|The riverbank of [[Manú National Park]].]]
Much of the natural habitat of the region remains intact, protected by sheer inaccessibility.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; People have dwelled along the major rivers for millennia and have subtly altered the forests on a small scale, but around the urban centers development proceeds. Very few roads exist in the region, limiting development. Intense [[deforestation]] is constrained to the few roads that do exist or around urban centers such as [[Iquitos]], [[Puerto Maldonado]], and [[Rio Branco, Acre|Rio Branco]].

[[Manú National Park]], a [[World Heritage Site]], protects {{convert|15328|km2|sqmi}} of pristine lowland forest in southern Peru, a large part of which falls into this ecoregion.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; The nearby [[Tambopata-Candamo]] reserve protects seven major forest types. This reserve offers refuge to game species that have been over-hunted in other areas such as tapirs, [[spider monkey]]s, jaguars, capybaras, white-lipped peccaries, monkeys, [[caimans]] and [[river turtle]]s. The [[Manuripi-Heath Amazonian Wildlife National Reserve]] is located in the southernmost area of this region in Bolivia covering {{convert|18900|km2|sqmi}} of dense tropical forest. Several extractive reserves, the largest being [[Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve]] and [[Alto Juruá Extractive Reserve]], are actively managed in Brazil. Other protected areas include national parks ([[Serra do Divisor National Park]], [[Madidi National Park]], [[Isoboro Secure National Park]], [[Bahuaja-Sonene National Park]]), national forests, [[Rio Acre Ecological Station]], [[Antimari State Forest]], [[Apurimac Reserve Zone]], among others. Most protected areas suffer from insufficient administration and patrol.

==Types and severity of threats==
[[File:Guadua-Bambus-Colombia.jpg|thumb|right|The [[invasive species|invasive]] ''[[Guadua]]'' bamboo is threatening the natural ecodiversity of the region.]]

Hunting may be threatening populations of the tapir (''[[Tapirus terrestris]]'') and large [[primates]] in the north.&lt;ref name=WWF/&gt; Some habitat is threatened by expansion of the agricultural and pastoral frontier, [[gold mining]], and selective [[logging]] that erodes the genetic diversity of a few valuable timber species. The economically important palm ''[[Euterpe precatoria]]'' is being depleted in some areas by unsustainable [[palm heart]] extraction. A dramatic problem that exists in the Brazilian State of Acre and in the adjacent area of Peru is the spread of the [[invasive species|invasive]] ''[[Guadua]]'' bamboo forests. This highly competitive bamboo invades and dominates abandoned clearings and threatens to dominate the disturbed areas in this region. Logging along major rivers and near urban centers has decimated populations of mahogany (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]''), tropical cedar (''[[Cedrela odorata]]''), and kapok (''[[Ceiba pentandra]]'').

During the period from 2004 to 2011 the ecoregion experienced an annual rate of habitat loss of 0.17%.{{sfn|Coca-Castro|Reymondin|Bellfield|Hyman|2013|p=12}}

'''A standard linear solid Q model (SLS) for attenuation and dispersion''' is one of many [[mathematical Q models]] that gives a definition of how the earth responds to [[seismic waves]]. When a plane wave propagates through a homogeneous [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] medium, the effects of amplitude attenuation and velocity dispersion may be combined conveniently into a single dimensionless parameter, Q, the medium-quality factor.

Transmission losses may occur due to friction or fluid movement, and whatever the physical mechanism, they can be conveniently described with an empirical formulation where elastic moduli and propagation velocity are complex functions of frequency. Ursin and Toverud&lt;ref&gt;Ursin B. and Toverud T. 2002 Comparison of seismic dispersion and attenuation models. Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica 46, 293–320.&lt;/ref&gt; compared different Q models including the above model (SLS-model).

In order to compare the different models they considered plane-wave propagation in a homogeneous viscoelastic medium. They used the Kolsky-Futterman model as a reference and studied the SLS model. This model was compared with the Kolsky-Futterman model.

The Kolsky-Futterman model was first described in the article ‘Dispersive body waves’ by Futterman (1962).&lt;ref&gt;Futterman (1962) ‘Dispersive body waves’. Journal of Geophysical Research 67. p.5279-91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kolsky's attenuation-dispersion model==

The Kolsky model assumes the attenuation α(w) to be strictly linear with frequency over the range of measurement:&lt;ref&gt;Wang 2008, p. 18, sec. 2.1: Kolsky's attenuation-dispersion model&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac {|w|}{(2 c_r Q_r)} \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

And defines the phase velocity as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{c(w)} =\frac {1}{c_r} (1-\frac {1}{\pi Q_r} ln |\frac{w}{w_r}|) \quad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

==SLS model==

The [[standard linear solid model]] is developed from the stress-strain relation. Using a linear combination of springs and dashpots to represent elastic and viscous components, Ursin and Toverud used one relaxation time.&lt;ref&gt;Ursin B. and Toverud T. 2002 Comparison of seismic dispersion and attenuation models. ''Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica'' 46, 293–320.&lt;/ref&gt; The model was first developed by Zener.&lt;ref&gt;Zener C. 1948 ''Elasticity and anelasticity of Metals''. University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The attenuation is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\frac {(w\tau_r)^2}{c_0 Q_c \tau_r[1+(w\tau_r)^2]} \quad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

And defines the phase velocity as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{c(w)} =\frac {1}{c_0} [1- \frac {(w\tau_r)^2}{Q_c[1+(w\tau_r)^2]}] \quad (4)&lt;/math&gt;

==Computations==
For each of the Q models, Ursin and Toverud computed the attenuation (1)(3) in the frequency band 0–300&amp;nbsp;Hz. Figure 1. presents the graph for the Kolsky model (blue) with two datasets (left and right)and same data – attenuation with c&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=2000&amp;nbsp;m/s, Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=100 and w&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=2π100 Hz. 

The SLS model (green) has two different datasets, 

left c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=1990&amp;nbsp;m/s, Q&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;=100 and τ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;=2π100

The '''''Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois regnes de la nature''''' was an illustrated [[encyclopedia]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s and [[mineral]]s, notable for including the first scientific descriptions of many [[species]], and for its attractive engravings. It was published in [[Paris]] by [[Charles Joseph Panckoucke]], from 1788 on. Although its several volumes can be considered a part of the greater ''[[Encyclopédie méthodique]]'', they were titled and issued separately.

{{aquatic layer topics}}

A '''thermocline''' (also known as the '''thermal layer''' or the '''metalimnion''' in lakes) is a thin but distinct layer in a large body of fluid (e.g. water, as in an ocean or lake; or air, e.g. an atmosphere) in which temperature changes more rapidly with depth than it does in the layers above or below. In the ocean, the thermocline divides the upper mixed layer from the calm deep water below.

Depending largely on [[season]], [[latitude]], and [[turbulence|turbulent]] mixing by [[wind]], thermoclines may be a semi-permanent feature of the [[body of water]] in which they occur, or they may form temporarily in response to phenomena such as the radiative [[diurnal temperature variation|heating/cooling]] of surface water during the day/night. Factors that affect the depth and thickness of a thermocline include [[seasonal lag|seasonal weather variations]], latitude, and local environmental conditions, such as [[tide]]s and [[current (fluid)|currents]].

==Oceans==

The temperature is nearly constant after 1500 meters depth.]]
[[File:ThermoclineSeasonDepth.png|thumb|200px|left|Graph of different thermoclines (depth vs. temperature) based on seasons and latitude]]
Most of the heat energy of sunlight is absorbed in the first few centimeters at the ocean's surface, which heats during the day and cools at night as heat energy is lost to space by radiation. [[water waves|Waves]] mix the water near the surface layer and distribute heat to deeper water such that the temperature may be relatively uniform in the upper 100 m (300 ft), depending on wave strength and the existence of surface turbulence caused by currents. Below this [[mixed layer]], the temperature remains relatively stable over day/night cycles. The temperature of the deep ocean drops gradually with depth. As [[saline water]] does not freeze until it reaches −2.3 °C (colder as depth and pressure increase) the temperature well below the surface is usually not far from zero degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Water/temp.html|publisher=[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|UCAR]] |accessdate=2008-05-09 |title=Temperature of Ocean Water}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thermocline varies in depth. It is semi-permanent in the tropics, variable in temperate regions (often deepest during the summer) and shallow to nonexistent in the polar regions, where the water column is cold from the surface to the bottom. A layer of sea ice will act as an insulation blanket.

In the open ocean, the thermocline is characterized by a negative [[sound speed gradient]], making the thermocline important in [[submarine warfare]] because it can reflect active [[sonar]] and other acoustic signals. This stems from a discontinuity in the acoustic impedance of water created by the sudden change in density. 

In [[scuba diving]], a thermocline where water drops in temperature by a few degrees Celsius quite suddenly can sometimes be observed between two bodies of water, for example where colder upwelling water runs into a surface layer of warmer water. It gives the water an appearance of wrinkled glass that is often used to obscure bathroom windows and is caused by the altered [[refraction|refractive index]] of the cold or warm water column. These same [[schlieren]] can be observed when hot air rises off the tarmac at airports or desert roads and is the cause of [[mirage]]s.

==Other water bodies==
Thermoclines can also be observed in lakes. In colder climates, this leads to a phenomenon called [[stratification (water)|stratification]]. During the summer, warm water, which is less dense, will sit on top of colder, denser, deeper water with a thermocline separating them. The warm layer is called the [[epilimnion]] and the cold layer is called the [[hypolimnion]]. Because the warm water is exposed to the sun during the day, a stable system exists and very little mixing of warm water and cold water occurs, particularly in calm weather.

One result of this stability is that as the summer wears on, there is less and less oxygen below the thermocline as the water below the thermocline never circulates to the surface and organisms in the water deplete the available oxygen. As winter approaches, the temperature of the surface water will drop as nighttime cooling dominates heat transfer. A point is reached where the density of the cooling surface water becomes greater than the density of the deep water and overturning begins as the dense surface water moves down under the influence of gravity. This process is aided by wind or any other process (currents for example) that agitates the water. This effect also occurs in Arctic and Antarctic waters, bringing water to the surface which, although low in oxygen, is higher in nutrients than the original surface water. This enriching of surface nutrients may produce [[algal bloom|blooms]] of [[phytoplankton]], making these areas productive.

As the temperature continues to drop, the water on the surface may get cold enough to freeze and the lake/ocean begins to ice over. A new thermocline develops where the densest water (4 °C) sinks to the bottom, and the less dense water (water that is approaching the freezing point) rises to the top.  Once this new stratification establishes itself, it lasts until the water warms enough for the 'spring turnover,' which occurs after the ice melts and the surface water temperature rises to 4 °C. During this transition, a [[thermal bar]] may develop.

Waves can occur on the thermocline, causing the depth of the thermocline as measured at a single location to oscillate (usually as a form of [[seiche]]). Alternately, the waves may be induced by flow over a raised bottom, producing a thermocline wave which does not change with time, but varies in depth as one moves into or against the flow.

==Atmosphere==
The lower atmosphere also typically contains a boundary between two distinct regions (the [[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]]), but that boundary (the [[tropopause]]) displays quite different behavior. However, atmospheric thermoclines, or [[Inversion (meteorology)|''inversions'']], can occur, e.g. as nighttime cooling of the Earth's surface produces cold, dense, often calm air adjacent to the ground. The coldest air is next to the ground, with air temperature increasing with height. At the top of this nighttime boundary layer (which may be only a hundred meters) the normal adiabatic temperature profile of the troposphere (i.e. temperature decreasing with altitude) is again observed. The thermocline or inversion layer occurs where the temperature profile changes from positive to negative with increasing height. The stability of the night time inversion is usually destroyed soon after sunrise as the sun's energy warms the ground, which warms the air in the inversion layer. The warmer, less dense air then rises, destroying the stability that characterizes the nightly inversion.

This phenomenon was first applied to the field of [[noise pollution]] study in the 1960s, contributing to the design of urban highways and [[noise barrier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hogan | first = C.

A '''tree well''' is a void or area of loose snow around the trunk of a tree enveloped in deep snow. Also known as "spruce traps", these voids present danger to [[hiker]]s, [[snowshoeing|snowshoers]], [[ski]]ers, and [[snowboard]]ers who fall into them.

==Formation==
A tree's branches shelter its trunk from snowfall, allowing a void or area of loose snow to form. Low-hanging branches as on small [[fir]]s further contribute to forming a tree well, as they efficiently shelter the area surrounding the trunk. Such wells have been observed as deep as 20 feet.&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite web |title=Tree Well and Snow Immersion Suffocation (SIS) |url=http://www.deepsnowsafety.org/ | publisher=Northwest Avalanche Institute |access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also occur near rocks and along streams.

Tree wells may be encountered in [[backcountry]], on ungroomed trails, off-[[piste]], and on ungroomed/piste boundaries. The risk of encountering one is greatest during and immediately following a heavy snowstorm.

==Hazard==
Victims can get trapped in tree wells and become unable to free themselves. In two experiments conducted in North America 90% of volunteers temporarily placed in tree wells were unable to rescue themselves.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

Frequently victims end up in wells head first, complicating recovery efforts. Often they are injured in the process, suffering [[joint dislocation]] or [[concussion]].  When fatal, this type of incident is termed a ''Non-Avalanche Related Snow Immersion Death'' (NARSID).&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

'''Tropospheric scatter''' (also known as '''troposcatter''') is a method of communicating with [[microwave radio]] signals over considerable distances – often up to {{convert|300|km|mi}}, and further depending on terrain and climate factors. This method of propagation uses the tropospheric scatter phenomenon, where radio waves at [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and [[Super high frequency|SHF]] [[Frequency|frequencies]] are randomly scattered as they pass through the upper layers of the [[troposphere]]. Radio signals are transmitted in a narrow beam aimed just above the horizon in the direction of the receiver station. As the signals pass through the troposphere, some of the energy is scattered back toward the Earth, allowing the receiver station to pick up the signal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-038/_5617.htm FS-1037C Definition of tropospheric scatter]&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, signals in the microwave frequency range travel in straight lines, and so are limited to ''[[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]]'' applications, in which the receiver can be 'seen' by the transmitter. Communication distances are limited by the [[horizon|visual horizon]] to around 30–40 miles (48–64 km). Troposcatter allows microwave communication beyond the horizon.  It was developed in the 1950s and used for military communications until [[communications satellite]]s largely replaced it in the 1970s.

Because the troposphere is turbulent and has a high proportion of moisture the tropospheric scatter radio signals are [[refracted]] and consequently only a tiny proportion of the radio energy is collected by the receiving antennas. Frequencies of transmission around 2&amp;nbsp;GHz are best suited for tropospheric scatter systems as at this frequency the wavelength of the signal interacts well with the moist, turbulent areas of the troposphere, improving [[signal to noise ratio]]s.

==Overview==
Historically, [[High-gain antenna|high gain]] [[Dish antenna|dish]] or [[billboard antenna]]s were required for tropospheric scatter systems as the [[Path loss|propagation loss]]es are very high; only about one billion-billionth (1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;) of the transmit power is available at the receiver. Paths were established at distances over 1,000&amp;nbsp;km. They required antennas ranging from 9 meters to 36 meters and amplifiers ranging from 1&amp;nbsp;kW to 50&amp;nbsp;kW. These were analogue systems which were capable of transmitting a few voice channels.

Troposcatter systems have evolved over the years. With [[communication satellite]]s used for long-distance communication links, current troposcatter systems are employed over shorter distances than previous systems, use smaller antennas and amplifiers, and have much higher bandwidth capabilities. Typical distances are between 50&amp;nbsp;km and 250&amp;nbsp;km, though greater distances can be achieved depending on the climate, terrain, and data rate required. Typical antenna sizes range from 1.2 meters to 12 meters while typical amplifier sizes range from 10W to 2&amp;nbsp;kW. Data rates over 20Mbit/s can be achieved with today's technology.

Tropospheric scatter is a fairly secure method of propagation as dish alignment is critical, making it extremely difficult to intercept the signals, especially if transmitted across open water, making them highly attractive to military users. Military systems have tended to be ‘thin-line’ tropo – so called because only a narrow [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] ‘information’ channel was carried on the tropo system; generally up to 32 analogue (4&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth) channels. Modern military systems are "Wideband" as they operate 4-16 Mbit/s digital data channels.

Civilian troposcatter systems, such as the [[British Telecom]] (BT) [[North Sea]] oil communications network, required higher capacity ‘information’ channels than were available using HF (high frequency – 3 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz) radio signals, before satellite technology was available. The BT systems, based at [[Scousburgh]] in the [[Shetland Islands]], [[Mormond Hill]] in [[Aberdeenshire]] and Row Brow near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], were capable of transmitting and receiving 156 analogue (4&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth) channels of data and telephony to / from North Sea oil production platforms, using [[frequency-division multiplexing]] (FDMX) to combine the channels.
  
Because of the nature of the turbulence in the troposphere, quadruple [[Antenna diversity|diversity propagation]] paths were used to ensure 99.98% reliability of the service, equating to about 3 minutes of downtime due to propagation drop out per month. The quadruple space and polarisation diversity systems needed two separate dish antennae (spaced several metres apart) and two differently [[Polarization (waves)|polarised]] [[feed horn]]s – one using vertical polarisation, the other using horizontal polarisation. This ensured that at least one signal path was open at any one time. The signals from the four different paths were recombined in the receiver where a phase corrector removed the [[phase difference]]s of each signal. Phase differences were caused by the different path lengths of each signal from transmitter to receiver. Once phase corrected, the four signals could be combined additively.

The U.S. Army and Air Force use tactical tropospheric scatter systems developed by [[Raytheon]] for long haul communications.  The systems come in two configurations, the original "heavy tropo", and a newer "light tropo" configuration exist.  The systems provide four [[Multiplexing|multiplexed]] group channels and trunk encryption, and 16 or 32 local analog phone extensions. The U.S. Marine Corps also uses the same device, albeit an older version.

They are able to hear, although no external ear is present, and have unique features in their skeleton, some of them apparently evolutionarily retained from fish.

During routine maintenance work at Karori Sanctuary in late 2008, a tuatara nest was uncovered,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitzealandia.com/news-item/found-mainland-nzs-first-tuatara-nest-in-hundreds-of-years/ New Zealand’s ‘living fossil’ confirmed as nesting on the mainland for the first time in 200 years!], Karori Sanctuary Trust, 31 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; with a hatchling found the following autumn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitzealandia.com/Site/Zealandia_Home/Inside/News/Media_Releases_2009/Tuatara_baby.aspx Our first baby tuatara!], Karori Sanctuary Trust, 18 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This is thought to be the first case of tuatara successfully breeding in the wild on the New Zealand mainland in over 200 years.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Tuatara, along with other, now-extinct members of the order [[Sphenodontia]], belong to the superorder [[Lepidosauria]], the only surviving taxon within [[Lepidosauromorpha]]. Squamates and tuatara both show [[Autotomy#Reptiles and salamanders|caudal autotomy]] (loss of the tail-tip when threatened), and have transverse cloacal slits.&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;Cree, Alison. 2002. ''Tuatara.'' In: Halliday, Tim and Adler, Kraig (eds.), ''The new encyclopedia of reptiles and amphibians'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp. 210–211. {{ISBN|0-19-852507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the tuatara probably lies close to the split between the Lepidosauromorpha and the [[Archosauromorpha]]. Though tuatara resemble lizards, the similarity is superficial, because the family has several characteristics unique among [[reptile]]s. The typical lizard shape is very common for the early [[amniotes]]; the oldest known fossil of a reptile, the ''[[Hylonomus]]'', resembles a modern lizard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =''Hylonomus lyelli ''| work = Symbols| publisher =Province of Nova Scotia|date=May 2003| url =http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/HOUSE_OF_ASSEMBLY/Symbols/fossil.htm| accessdate =24 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuatara were originally classified as lizards in 1831 when the [[British Museum]] received a skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lutz|2005|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The genus remained misclassified until 1867, when [[Albert C. L. G. Günther|Albert Günther]] of the British Museum noted features similar to birds, turtles, and crocodiles. He proposed the order Rhynchocephalia (meaning "beak head") for the tuatara and its fossil relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lutz|2005|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many disparately related species were subsequently added to the Rhynchocephalia, resulting in what taxonomists call a "[[wastebasket taxon]]".&lt;ref name="fraser"&gt;{{cite book | author=Fraser, Nicholas; Sues, Hans-Dieter; (eds) | title="Phylogeny" In the Shadow of the Dinosaurs: Early Mesozoic Tetrapods | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1994 | isbn=0-521-45242-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Wendell Williston|Williston]] proposed the Sphenodontia to include only tuatara and their closest fossil relatives in 1925.&lt;ref name="fraser" /&gt; ''Sphenodon'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "wedge" (σφήν, σφηνός/''sphenos'') and "tooth" (ὀδούς, ὀδόντος/''odontos'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Sphenodon| work =Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)| publisher =Random House, Inc| url =http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sphenodon| accessdate =8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuatara have been referred to as [[living fossil]]s,&lt;ref name="TerraNature"/&gt; which means that they retain many [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] characteristics from around the time of the squamate–rhynchocephalian split (220 MYA).&lt;ref name="dallas"&gt;{{cite web | last=Russell| first=Matt | title= Tuatara, Relics of a Lost Age | work = Cold Blooded News| publisher= Colorado Herpetological Society|date=August 1998 | url=http://webspinners.com/coloherp/cb-news/archive/nature/tuatara.php | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419065506/http://webspinners.com/coloherp/cb-news/archive/nature/tuatara.php |archivedate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Wu, Xiao-Chun | title="Late Triassic-Early Jurassic sphenodontians from China and the phylogeny of the Sphenodontia" in Nicholas Fraser &amp; Hans-Dieter Sues (eds) In the Shadow of the Dinosaurs: Early Mesozoic Tetrapods | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1994 | isbn=0-521-45242-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Sphenodontia has shown this group has undergone a variety of changes throughout the [[Mesozoic]], and a March 2008 molecular study showed their rate of molecular evolution has been the fastest of any animal yet examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/about-massey/news/article.cfm?mnarticle=tuatara-evolving-faster-than-any-other-species-01-03-2008|title=Tuatara evolving faster than any other species|publisher=[[Massey University]]|date=January 4, 2008|accessdate=28 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/animals/080326-fastest-tuatara.html|title=Fastest Evolving Creature is 'Living Dinosaur'|publisher=LiveScience|date=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the niches occupied by [[lizards]] today were then held by sphenodontians. There was even a successful group of aquatic sphenodontians known as [[Pleurosaurus|pleurosaurs]], which differed markedly from living tuatara. Tuatara show cold-weather adaptations that allow them to thrive on the islands of New Zealand; these adaptations may be unique to tuatara since their sphenodontian ancestors lived in the much warmer climates of the [[Mesozoic]]. For instance, ''[[Palaeopleurosaurus]]'' appears to have had a much shorter lifespan compared to the modern tuatara.&lt;ref name="density"&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = N. | last1 = Klein | first2 = T.M. | last2 = Scheyer | date = 2017 | title = Microanatomy and life history in ''Palaeopleurosaurus'' (Rhynchocephalia: Pleurosauridae) from the Early Jurassic of Germany | journal = The Science of Nature | volume = 104 | issue = 4 | doi = 10.1007/s00114-016-1427-3 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00114-016-1427-3| bibcode = 2017SciNa.104....4K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A species of sphenodontine is known from the [[Miocene]] [[Saint Bathans Fauna]]. Whether it is refereable to ''Sphenodon'' proper is not entirely clear, but is assumed to be closely related to tuataras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marc E. H. Jones, Alan J. D.

While there is currently considered to be only one living species of tuatara, two species were previously identified: ''Sphenodon punctatus'', or northern tuatara, and the much rarer ''Sphenodon guntheri'', or Brothers Island tuatara, which is confined to [[The Brothers (islands), New Zealand|North Brother Island]] in [[Cook Strait]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Tuatara scale.png|thumb|right|upright=.75|Size comparison of male ''S.&amp;nbsp;punctatus'' and human]]
The tuatara is considered the most unspecialised living [[amniote]]; the brain and mode of locomotion resemble those of amphibians and the heart is more primitive than that of any other reptile.&lt;ref name="dallas"/&gt; The lungs have a single chamber and lack [[bronchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhO4WAZcVLEC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XejjN8u8nx&amp;sig=KApCgANps4Kru6fVHrQisN-FI6g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=li9QSqXsL4jz-QanjfT_Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1|title=Infectious Diseases and Pathology of Reptiles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both species are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], males being larger.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt; Adult ''S. punctatus'' males measure {{convert|61|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and females {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt; The [[San Diego Zoo]] even cites a length of up to {{convert|80|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[San Diego Zoo]] |url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-tuatara.html |title=San Diego Zoo's Animal Bytes: Tuatara |work= |accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males weigh up to {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and females up to {{convert|0.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt; Brother's Island tuatara are slightly smaller, weighing up to 660&amp;nbsp;g (1.3&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name="NZRG"/&gt;

The tuatara's greenish brown colour matches its environment, and can change over its lifetime. Tuatara shed their skin at least once per year as adults,&lt;ref name=lutz16/&gt; and three or four times a year as juveniles. Tuatara sexes differ in more than size. The spiny crest on a tuatara's back, made of triangular, soft folds of skin, is larger in males, and can be stiffened for display. The male abdomen is narrower than the female's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/reptiles/rep_tuatara.html |title=Tuataras at Animal Corner |accessdate=31 December 2007 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skull===
In the course of evolution, the [[skull]] has been modified in most [[diapsids]] from the original version evident in the fossil record. However, all the original features are preserved in that of the tuatara; it has two openings – a [[Temporal bone|temporal]] [[fenestra (anatomy)|fenestra]] on each side of the skull, with complete arches. In addition, the upper jaw is firmly attached to the skull.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt; This makes for a very rigid, inflexible construction. [[Testudines]] ([[turtle]]s and [[tortoise]]s) have [[anapsid]] skulls – they lack any temporal fenestrae, are sometimes considered to be the most primitive among amniotes, though evidence strongly indicates they may have lost the temporal openings rather than never having had them.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt;&lt;ref name="rieppel&amp;debraga1996"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/384453a0 | last1 = Rieppel | first1 = O. | last2 = DeBraga | first2 = M. | year = 1996 | title = Turtles as diapsid reptiles | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 384 | issue = 6608| pages = 453–455 | bibcode = 1996Natur.384..453R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zardoya&amp;meyer1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.24.14226 | last1 = Zardoya | first1 = R. | last2 = Meyer | first2 = A. | year = 1998 | title = Complete mitochondrial genome suggests diapsid affinities of turtles | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 24| pages = 14226–14231 | pmid = 9826682 | pmc = 24355 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...9514226Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tip of the upper jaw is beak-like and separated from the remainder of the jaw by a notch. There is a single row of teeth in the lower jaw and a double row in the upper, with the bottom row fitting perfectly between the two upper rows when the mouth is closed.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt; This specific tooth arrangement is not seen in any other reptile; although most [[snake]]s have a double row of teeth in their upper jaws, their arrangement and function is different from the tuatara's. The jaws, joined by [[ligament]], chew with backwards and forwards movements combined with a shearing up and down action. The force of the bite is suitable for shearing [[chitin]] and bone.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt; Fossils indicate that this jaw structure began developing about 180 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/science/the-tuataras-unique-slice-and-dice-strategy-for-chewing.html|title=A Unique Slice-and-Dice Strategy for Chewing|date=5 June 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tuatara's teeth are not replaced, since they are not separate structures like real teeth, but sharp projections of the jaw bone.&lt;ref name=lutzp27&gt;{{Harvnb|Lutz|2005|p=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As their teeth wear down, older tuatara have to switch to softer prey such as [[earthworm]]s, [[larva]]e, and [[slug]]s, and eventually have to chew their food between smooth jaw bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Mlot| first =Christine| title =Return of the Tuatara: A relic from the age of dinosaurs gets a human assist| work =Science News| publisher =Science News| date =8 November 1997| url =http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/pdfs/data/1997/152-19/15219-21.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate =24 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The brain of ''Sphenodon'' fills only half of the volume of its [[endocranium]].&lt;ref name="larsson2001" /&gt; This proportion has actually been used by paleontologists trying to estimate the volume of dinosaur brains based on fossils.&lt;ref name="larsson2001" /&gt; However, the proportion of the tuatara endocranium occupied by its brain may not be a very good guide to the same proportion in Mesozoic dinosaurs since modern birds are surviving dinosaurs but have brains which occupy a much greater relative volume within the endocranium.&lt;ref name="larsson2001"&gt;Larsson HCE (2001).

===Sensory organs===
The eyes can [[Accommodation (eye)|focus]] independently, and are specialized with three types of photoreceptive cells, all with fine structural characteristics of retinal cone cells &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Meyer-Rochow V.B.|author2=Wohlfahrt S.|author3=Ahnelt P.K.|title=Photoreceptor cell types in the retina of the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) have cone charateristics| date=2005| journal=Micron|volume=36|pages=423-428}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for both day and night vision, and a [[tapetum lucidum]] which reflects onto the retina to enhance vision in the dark. There is also a third eyelid on each eye, the [[nictitating membrane]].

The tuatara has a third eye on the top of its head called the [[parietal eye]]. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a [[cornea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1772576 | pmid=15751188 | volume=89 | title=The lonely eye | date=March 2005 | journal=Br J Ophthalmol | page=256 | last1 = Schwab | first1 = IR | last2 = O'Connor | first2 = GR | doi=10.1136/bjo.2004.059105}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[retina]] with rod-like structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt; Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing [[ultraviolet]] rays to produce [[vitamin D]],&lt;ref name="KCC"/&gt; as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with [[thermoregulation]].&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt; Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the [[pineal gland]], which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt; Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding [[Animal navigation|navigation]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, Tim R. 2002. ''Salamanders and newts: Finding breeding ponds.'' In: Halliday, Tim and Adler, Kraig (eds.), ''The new encyclopedia of reptiles and amphibians'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, p. 52. {{ISBN|0-19-852507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[turtle]]s, the tuatara has the most primitive hearing organs among the amniotes. There is no [[eardrum]] and no earhole,&lt;ref name=lutzp27/&gt; and the [[middle ear]] cavity is filled with loose tissue, mostly [[adipose tissue|adipose (fatty) tissue]]. The [[stapes]] comes into contact with the [[Quadrate bone|quadrate]] (which is immovable), as well as the [[hyoid bone|hyoid]] and [[squamosal]]. The [[hair cell]]s are unspecialized, innervated by both [[Afferent nerve|afferent]] and [[efferent nerve]] fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], with peak sensitivity of 40&amp;nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]] at 200&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Kaplan | first=Melissa | title= Reptile Hearing | publisher=Melissa Kaplan's Herp Care Collection| date=6 September 2003 | url=http://www.anapsid.org/reptilehearing.html | accessdate=24 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spine and ribs===
The tuatara [[Vertebral column|spine]] is made up of hourglass-shaped [[Vertebral column#Classification|amphicoelous]] vertebrae, concave both before and behind.&lt;ref name=lutzp27/&gt; This is the usual condition of fish vertebrae and some amphibians, but is unique to tuatara within the amniotes.

The tuatara has [[gastralium|gastralia]], rib-like bones also called gastric or abdominal ribs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aquarium-berlin.de/en/experience/animal-highlights/tuatara.html | accessdate=11 September 2007 | title=Zoo Berlin: Tuatara | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814075005/http://www.aquarium-berlin.de/en/experience/animal-highlights/tuatara.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; | archivedate=14 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the presumed ancestral trait of diapsids. They are found in some [[lizard]]s, where they are mostly made of cartilage, as well as crocodiles and the tuatara, and are not attached to the spine or thoracic ribs. The true ribs are small projections, with small, hooked bones, called uncinate processes, found on the rear of each rib.&lt;ref name=lutzp27/&gt; This feature is also present in birds. The tuatara is the only living [[tetrapod]] with well-developed gastralia and uncinate processes.

In the early tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, together with bony elements such as bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and [[clavicle]]s (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in the guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia may have been involved in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles. The pelvis and shoulder girdles are arranged differently from those of lizards, as is the case with other parts of the internal anatomy and its scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nzphoto.tripod.com/animal/tuatara.htm |title=Tuatara Reptile, New Zealand |accessdate=31 December 2007 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114212222/http://nzphoto.tripod.com/animal/tuatara.htm |archivedate=14 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tail and back===
The spiny plates on the back and tail of the tuatara resemble those of a crocodile more than a lizard, but the tuatara shares with lizards the ability to break off its tail when caught by a predator, and then regenerate it. The regrowth takes a long time and differs from that of lizards. Well illustrated reports on tail regeneration in tuatara have been published by Alibardi &amp; Meyer-Rochow &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal| author1=Alibardi L.|author2=Meyer-Rochow V.B.| title=Ultrastructural survey of the spinal cord of young tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) with emphasis on the glia|date=1990|journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology|volume=17|pages=73-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal| author1=Alibardi L.|author2=Meyer-Rochow V.B.| title=Fine structure of regenerating caudal spinal cord in adult tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus)|date=1990|journal=Journal fuer Hirnforschung (Journal of Brain Research)|volume= 31(5)|pages=613-621}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Age determination ===
Currently, there are two means of determining tuataras' age. Using microscopic inspection, hematoxylinophilic rings can be identified and counted in both the phalanges and the femur. Phalangeal hematoxylinophilic rings can be used for tuataras up to 12–14 years of age, as they cease to form around this age. Femoral rings follow a similar trend, however they are useful for tuataras up to 25–35 years of age. Around that age, femoral rings cease to form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castanet|first=J.|last2=Newman|first2=D. G.|last3=Girons|first3=H. Saint|date=1988|title=Skeletochronological Data on the Growth, Age, and Population Structure of the Tuatara, ''Sphenodon punctatus'', on Stephens and Lady Alice Islands, New Zealand|jstor=3892195|journal=Herpetologica|volume=44|issue=1|pages=25–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research on age determination methods for tuataras is required, as tuataras have lifespans much longer than 35 years. One possibility could be via examination of tooth wear and tear, as tuataras have fused sets of teeth.

==Behaviour==
Adult tuatara are [[Landform|terrestrial]] and [[nocturnal]] reptiles, though they will often bask in the sun to warm their bodies. Hatchlings hide under logs and stones, and are [[Diurnality|diurnal]], likely because adults are cannibalistic. Tuatara thrive in temperatures much lower than those tolerated by most reptiles, and [[hibernation|hibernate]] during winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Tuatara: Facts| publisher =Southland Museum| date =18 January 2006| url =http://www.southlandmuseum.com/tuatara_-_facts.htm| accessdate =2 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609034405/http://www.southlandmuseum.com/tuatara_-_facts.htm |archivedate=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remain active at temperatures as low as {{convert|5|°C|°F|0}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/your-town/dunedin/48665/new-arrivals-thrill-staff-sanctuary|title=New arrivals thrill staff at sanctuary|last=Schofield|first=Edith|date=24 March 2009|publisher=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while temperatures over {{convert|28|°C|°F|0}} are generally fatal.

Burrowing seabirds such as [[petrel]]s, [[prion (bird)|prions]], and [[shearwater]]s share the tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the [[bird]]s' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' [[guano]] helps to maintain invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey; including [[beetle]]s, [[cricket]]s, and [[spider]]s. Their diets also consist of [[frog]]s, [[lizard]]s, and bird's eggs and chicks.

However, at {{convert|22|°C|°F|0}}, 80% are likely to be males, and at {{convert|20|°C|°F|0}}, 80% are likely to be females; at {{convert|18|°C|°F|0}} all hatchlings will be females.&lt;ref name="KCC"/&gt; Some evidence indicates sex determination in tuatara is determined by both genetic and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cree A. |author2=Thompson M.

===Distribution and threats===
Tuatara were once widespread on New Zealand's main North and South Islands, where [[subfossil]] remains have been found in sand dunes, caves, and Māori [[midden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Towns|first=David R.|author2=Daugherty, Charles H.|author3=Cree, Alison|title=Raising the prospects for a forgotten fauna: a review of 10 years of conservation effort for New Zealand reptiles|journal=Biological Conservation|year=2001|volume=99|pages=3–16|url=http://www.claudius-r-us.com/forum/download/file.php?id=77|accessdate=11 March 2012|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(00)00184-1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131734/http://www.claudius-r-us.com/forum/download/file.php?id=77|archive-date=24 April 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiped out from the main islands before European settlement, they were long confined to 32 offshore islands free of mammals.&lt;ref name="DoC"/&gt; The islands are difficult to get to,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lutz|2005|pp=59–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and are colonised by few animal species, indicating that some animals absent from these islands may have caused tuatara to disappear from the mainland. However, ''kiore'' ([[Polynesian rat]]s) had recently become established on several of the islands, and tuatara were persisting, but not breeding, on these islands.&lt;ref&gt;Crook, I. G. 1973.

===Eradication of rats===
Tuatara were removed from [[Stanley Island, New Zealand|Stanley]], [[Red Mercury Island|Red Mercury]] and [[Cuvier Island]]s in 1990 and 1991, and maintained in captivity to allow Polynesian rats to be eradicated on those islands. All three populations bred in captivity, and after successful eradication of the rats, all individuals, including the new juveniles, were returned to their islands of origin. In the 1991–92 season, [[Little Barrier Island]] was found to hold only eight tuatara, which were taken into ''[[in situ conservation|in situ]]'' captivity, where females produced 42 eggs, which were incubated at Victoria University. The resulting offspring were subsequently held in an enclosure on the island, then released into the wild in 2006 after rats were eradicated there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fauna on Little Barrier Island|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-visit/auckland/hauraki-gulf-islands/little-barrier-island-nature-reserve-hauturu-o-toi/features/#fauna|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hen and Chicken Islands]], Pacific rats were eradicated on Whatupuke in 1993, Lady Alice Island in 1994, and Coppermine Island in 1997. Following this program, juveniles have once again been seen on the latter three islands. In contrast, rats persist on Hen Island of the same group, and no juvenile tuatara had been seen there as of 2001. In the [[Alderman Islands]], Middle Chain Island holds no tuatara, but it is considered possible for rats to swim between Middle Chain and other islands that do hold tuatara, and the rats were eradicated in 1992 to prevent this.&lt;ref name=recovery /&gt; Another rodent eradication was carried out on the Rangitoto Islands east of [[D'Urville Island, New Zealand|D'Urville Island]], to prepare for the release of 432 Cook Strait tuatara juveniles in 2004, which were being raised at Victoria University as of 2001.&lt;ref name=recovery /&gt;&lt;!--can we find out whether this plan was followed through?--&gt;
[[File:Tuatara karori head.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tuatara at the [[Karori Wildlife Sanctuary|Karori Sanctuary]] are given coloured markings on the head for identification.]]

====Brothers Island tuatara====
''Sphenodon guntheri'' is present naturally on one small island with a population of approximately 400. In 1995, 50 juvenile and 18 adult Brothers Island tuatara were moved to Titi Island in Cook Strait, and their establishment monitored. Two years later, more than half of the animals had been seen again and of those all but one had gained weight. In 1998, 34 juveniles from captive breeding and 20 wild-caught adults were similarly transferred to [[Matiu/Somes Island]], a more publicly accessible location within Wellington Harbour. The captive juveniles were from induced layings from wild females.&lt;ref name=recovery /&gt;

In late October 2007, 50 tuatara collected as eggs from North Brother Island and hatched at Victoria University were being released onto [[Long Island, Marlborough|Long Island]] in the outer [[Marlborough Sounds]]. The animals had been cared for at Wellington Zoo for the last five years and have been kept in secret in a specially built enclosure at the zoo, off display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Rare tuatara raised at Wellington Zoo | publisher = [[Wellington Zoo]] | date = 29 October 2007 | url = http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC0710/S00061.htm |accessdate =19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another out of country population of Brothers Island tuatara that was given to the San Diego Zoological Society and is housed off-display at the San Diego Zoo facility in Balboa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/tuatara|title=Reptiles{{!}}Tuatara{{!}}At the zoo|accessdate=11 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No successful reproductive efforts have been reported yet.

====Northern tuatara====
''Sphenodon punctatus'' naturally occurs on 29 islands, and its population is estimated to be over 60,000 individuals.&lt;ref name=encyclo /&gt; In 1996, 32 adult northern tuatara were moved from [[Moutoki Island]] to [[Moutohora Island|Moutohora]]. The carrying capacity of Moutohora is estimated at 8,500 individuals, and the island could allow public viewing of wild tuatara.&lt;ref name=recovery /&gt; In 2003, 60 northern tuatara were introduced to [[Tiritiri Matangi Island]] from Middle Island in the [[Mercury Islands|Mercury group]]. They are occasionally seen sunbathing by visitors to the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/getting-involved/students-and-teachers/field-trips-by-region/tiri-education-kit/15-part-4-reptiles-167-174.pdf Translocated reptiles], Part 4, [http://www.doc.govt.nz/getting-involved/for-teachers/field-trip-resources/field-trips-by-region/auckland/tiritiri-matangi-island/teaching-resource/ Tiritiri Matangi – An education resource for schools]. Department of Conservation, November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mainland release of ''S. punctatus'' occurred in 2005 in the heavily fenced and monitored [[Karori Wildlife Sanctuary|Karori Sanctuary]].&lt;ref name="karori"/&gt; The second mainland release took place in October 2007, when a further 130 were transferred from [[Stephens Island, New Zealand|Stephens Island]] to the Karori Sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/4243952a7693.html|title=130 Tuatara Find Sanctuary|publisher=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|date=20 October 2007|accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2009, the first recorded wild-born offspring were observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/2278328/Life-will-be-wild-for-new-boy/|title=Life will be wild for new boy |publisher=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|date=20 March 2009|accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Captive breeding===
The first successful breeding of tuatara in captivity is believed to have achieved by Sir [[Algernon Thomas]] at either his University offices or residence in Symonds Street in the late 1880s or his new home, Trewithiel, in Mount Eden in the early 1890s.

Several tuatara breeding programmes are active within New Zealand. [[southland museum and art gallery|Southland Museum and Art Gallery]] in [[Invercargill]] was the first institution to have a tuatara breeding programme; they breed ''S. punctatus''.

[[Hamilton Zoo]], [[Auckland Zoo]] and [[Wellington Zoo]] also breed tuatara for release into the wild. At Auckland Zoo in the 1990s it was discovered that the temperature at which the eggs are incubated determines the sex of the animal.

The [[Victoria University of Wellington]] maintains a research programme into the captive breeding of tuatara, and the [[Mt Bruce Wildlife Centre|Pukaha Mount Bruce Wildlife Centre]] keeps a pair and a juvenile.

The WildNZ Trust has a tuatara breeding enclosure at [[Ruawai]]. One notable captive breeding success story took place in January 2009, when all 11 eggs belonging to 110-year-old tuatara Henry and 80-year-old tuatara Mildred hatched. This story is especially remarkable as Henry required surgery to remove a cancerous tumour in order to successfully breed.&lt;ref name="CNNDad"/&gt;

In January 2016, [[Chester Zoo]], England, announced that they succeeded in breeding the tuatara in captivity for the first time outside its homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/tuatura-lizard-like-reptile-takes-38-years-to-lay-an-egg-in-chester-zoo-a6844041.html|title=Tuatara: Lizard-like reptile takes 38 years to lay an egg in Chester Zoo| newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=31 January 2016|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
Tuatara feature in a number of indigenous legends, and are held as ''ariki'' (God forms). Tuatara are regarded as the messengers of [[Whiro]], the [[deity|god]] of death and disaster, and Māori women are forbidden to eat them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Williams| first =David| title =Chapter 6: Traditional Kaitiakitanga Rights and Responsibilities| work =Wai 262 Report: Matauranga Maori and Taonga| publisher =Waitangi Tribunal| year =2001| url =http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/doclibrary/public/wai262/matauranga_maori/Chapt06.pdf| format =PDF| accessdate =2 June 2007| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070628044808/http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/doclibrary/public/wai262/matauranga_maori/Chapt06.pdf| archive-date =28 June 2007| dead-url =yes| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuatara also indicate ''tapu'' (the borders of what is sacred and restricted),&lt;ref name=ramdstad&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ramstad Kristina M. |author2=Nelson N.

The tuatara was featured on one side of the [[New Zealand five-cent coin]], which was phased out in October 2006. ''Tuatara'' was also the name of the Journal of the Biological Society of Victoria University College and subsequently [[Victoria University of Wellington]], published from 1947 until 1993. It has now been digitised by the [[New Zealand Electronic Text Centre]], also at Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=New Zealand Electronic Text Centre |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-corpus-tuatara.html |title=Tuatara : Journal of the Biological Society |work= |accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* A tuatara named "Tua" is prominently featured in the novel ''[[Turtles All the Way Down (novel)|Turtles All The Way Down]]'' by [[John Green (author)|John Green]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/books/2017/06/23/john-green-turtles-all-the-way-down-details/|title=Everything We Know About John Green's New Book|date=2017-06-23|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The tuatara was the inspiration for a DC Comics superhero, also with a third eye, called [[Tuatara (comics)|Tuatara]], member of the [[Global Guardians]].
* There is a brand of New Zealand craft beer named after the Tuatara which particularly references the third eye in its advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tuatarabrewing.co.nz/the-third-eye/about|title=About - The Third Eye » Tuatara Breweries|website=Tuatarabrewing.co.nz|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[SSC Tuatara|Tuatara]] hypercar, designed and manufactured by [[SSC North America]] in [[Tri-Cities, Washington]], is named after the reptile, noting its fast evolving DNA and "peaks on the back" as inspiration in the creation of the car.
* The [[Auckland Tuatara]], one of two expansion teams for the 2018/19 [[Australian Baseball League]] season, chose the tuatara name to celebrate the resilience of the ancient reptiles, and to raise awareness of New Zealand's commitment to species protection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8355">The '''Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy''' is an award for the fastest trans-Atlantic crossing by a surface vessel, one of several such awards that have grown out of the contest for the prestigious [[Blue Riband| Blue Riband of the Atlantic]].
The trophy was created following [[Richard Branson]]'s record-breaking Atlantic crossing in 1986 and the refusal by the American Merchant Marine Museum to surrender the [[Hales Trophy]], the then only official award for the Atlantic crossing record. The Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy is currently held by the [[Aga Khan IV|Aga Khan]]'s vessel, ''[[Destriero]]''.

==Background==
The Blue Riband of the Atlantic was a contest between Atlantic passenger shipping companies and their express liners to achieve the fastest average speed on a commercial crossing. The contest was unofficial, involving no set rules or tangible award, and was undertaken for the prestige the accolade brought. In 1935 British businessman [[Harold Hales]] created the Hales Trophy as a means of regularizing the contest, though the trophy's actual history is chequered. It passed to the owners of several express liners, though not to [[Cunard]], owner of the record-breaking ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'', and was won in 1952 by the American Lines liner ''[[SS United States|United States]]''. Thereafter the competition lapsed, and ''United States'' herself was laid up in 1969.

In 1985 British entrepreneur Richard Branson's attempt to break the ''United States''{{'}}s record and win the Blue Riband led to the building of ''Virgin Atlantic Challenger'', which failed in a crossing in July of that year. In 1986. a second attempt by Branson, in '' Virgin Atlantic Challenger II'', set a new speed record, but the [[American Merchant Marine Museum]] refused to surrender the Hales Trophy, claiming ''Challenger'' was not a commercial passenger ship. Undaunted, Branson had a new trophy made, making it a challenge trophy open to any who could beat ''Virgin Atlantic Challenger's'' record.

The Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy is a three-foot silver sculpture, modelled on the [[Bishop Rock Lighthouse]], chosen as the finishing line for many of the Blue Riband crossings, and of the successful 1986 voyage. The model depicts the lighthouse and the rock itself.

==History==
Branson's first attempt on the record, in 65&amp;nbsp;ft twin-hull '' Virgin Atlantic Challenger'', departed  New York  in June 1985. After surviving rough weather and the threat of late icebergs ''Challenger'' was fatally damaged 100 miles from Bishops Rock, the intended finishing line, and sank in heavy seas. All the crew were saved.
The following year, in a new craft, the 72&amp;nbsp;ft monohull '' Virgin Atlantic Challenger II'',  Branson completed the crossing in three days, eight hours and 31 minutes, averaging just under 36 [[Knot (unit)|knots]]; he thus shaved two hours and nine minutes off the time set by ''United States'' in 1952. Branson had unfurled a six-foot blue pennant to mark the achievement, and announced “we are throwing down the gauntlet for anyone else to make a transatlantic challenge and beat it”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/0F90AF8F4D3A8B8E?p=UKNB Branson captures Blue Riband-Virgin Challenger Atlantic crossing] Nicolas Beeston, 30 June 1986 [[The Times]]; retrieved 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; but the AMMM later derided his achievement, referring to ''Challenger'' as “a little toy boat”. In response to this Branson decided to commission the new trophy, open to all challengers.

In 1988 a new challenge was planned by Paolo Vitelli, in a 100&amp;nbsp;ft monohull, ''Azimut Atlantic Challenger'', but this attempt came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/0F90F702B692441C?p=UKNB A rich man's quest for the blue riband] 24 June 1988 [[The Times]];retrieved 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year American businessman [[Tom Gentry]] made an attempt in his 110&amp;nbsp;ft powerboat ''Gentry Eagle'', (which cost $7 million in 1988&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo-DT2BBPh8&lt;/ref&gt; (${{format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|7e6|1988}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars{{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) and was fitted with twin 3,480 hp MTU V396 TB94s turbocharged marine diesel engines, in addition to a single 4,500 horsepower Textron Lycoming TF40 marine turbine engine for a total of 11,500 horsepower)&lt;ref name=Ventana_Reinhart &gt; {{ cite web | url=http://www.ventanamonthly.com/article.php?id=620&amp;IssueNum=68 | doi= | title=The World's Fastes Yacht—Is In Your Backyard - The little known story of Gentry Eagle | last=Reinhart | first=John | publisher=Southland Publishing | date=2012-01-01 | accessdate=2018-10-29 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131064606/http://www.ventanamonthly.com/article.php?id=620&amp;IssueNum=68 | archive-date=2012-01-31 | dead-url=no | pages= | quote=&lt;blockquote&gt;Gentry Eagle is powered by 11,500 horses...  Gentry met with the renowned performance boat engineer Peter Birkett, who actually designed Virgin Challenger, Branson’s Blue Riband winning boat. Together they came up with an aluminum deep-V hull, an engine room packed with two MTU 16V396 TB94s sequentially turbocharged marine diesel engines and a 4,500 horsepower Textron Lycoming marine turbine, and an Arneson surface drive strapped on the back.  All that marine jargon has a simple translation: burning speed. To deal with the horrific beating the hull would take during a high-speed crossing, Gentry employed Vosper Thornycroft LTD, a company known for building destroyers, frigates, and fast attack craft. The boat was welded using a meta-lax sub-harmonic stress relieving process.&lt;/blockquote&gt; }} &lt;/ref&gt; but she was damaged by heavy seas off Newfoundlland and forced to turn back. Gentry's aim was to “bring blue riband home”, which he achieved the following year. His second attempt in July 1989 saw ''Gentry Eagle'' cross the line in 62 hours 7 minutes, at an average speed of {{ convert | 47.4 | kn | mph }}, exceeding Branson's record by almost a quarter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/0F910306D8210308?p=UKNB Eagle wings its way to a transatlantic record] Barry Pickthall, Dave Sansted, 28 July 1989 [[The Times]];retrieved 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Gentry was met at [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly]], by Branson and warmly congratulated; he subsequently received the trophy to mark his achievement.

In 1991 it was reported that three challengers were under construction; a new boat, ''Eagle II'' from Gentry,  ''North East Spirit'' from [[Richard Noble]], the land speed record holder, and ''[[Destriero]]'', from the [[Aga Khan IV|Aga Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/0F91EBC69C2529E6?p=UKNB Challenge awaits high-powered trio] Barry Pickthall, 12 April 1991 [[The Times]];retrieved 3 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the event, only ''Destriero'' made the crossing, setting a new record with an average speed of 53 knots (the time was not comparable, as the route taken, from [[Tarifa, Spain]] to New York, was longer).

Despite rumours of new challengers with radical hull designs ''Destriero''{{'}}s record remains unbroken.
