{{Culture of Albania}}

The '''Albanian art''' ({{IPA-sq|aˈr:ti ʃcipˈta:rɛ}} — {{Lang-sq|Arti Shqiptarë}}) refers to all [[art|artistic expressions]] and [[artwork]]s in [[Albania]] or produced by [[Albanians]]. The country's art is either work of arts produced by its [[Albanian people|people]] and influenced by its [[Culture of Albania|culture]] and [[Traditions of Albania|traditions]]. It has preserved its original elements and traditions despite its long and eventful [[History of Albania|history]] around the time when Albania was populated to [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greek]]s and subsequently conquered by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s, [[Eastern Roman Empire|Byzantine]]s, [[Venetian Empire|Venetian]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s. 
 
At different times, [[Illyrian art|Illyrian]], [[Ancient Greek art|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman art|Roman art]] developed in Albania and survived in a number of media inclusive of [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[pottery]], and [[mosaic]]. The [[Rock inscriptions of the Grama Bay|rock inscriptions]] in [[Bays of Albania|Grama Bay]] and [[mosaic]] in [[The Beauty of Durrës|Durrës]] can be traced back to the [[4th century BC]] and there are nonetheless ancient remains of extraordinary quality available at [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Byllis]], [[Rozafa Castle|Shkodër]], [[Butrint]] and [[Protected areas of Albania#Archaeological Parks|elsewhere]] across the country.

The centerpiece of medieval Albanian art started with the successor of the [[Roman Empire]], namely the [[Byzantine Empire]] that ruled the great majority of Albania and the [[Balkan Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="ByzantineAlbania"&gt;{{cite web|title=Icons from the Orthodox Communities of Albania - COLLECTION OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF MEDIEVAL ART, KORCË|url=https://helios-eie.ekt.gr/EIE/bitstream/10442/8555/1/INR_Drakopoulou_06_01.pdf|website=helios-eie.ekt.gr|page=20|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised gradually of [[fresco]]es, [[mural]]s, and [[icon]]s painted with an admirable use of color and [[Gold (color)|gold]]. [[Onufri]], [[David Selenica]], [[Kostandin Shpataraku]] and the [[Zografi Brothers]] are the most eminent representatives of medieval Albanian art. The [[Epitaph of Gllavenica]], an [[epitaph]] written on a [[shroud]], is one of the best artifacts of this genre in the [[Balkans]].

During the [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman invasion]] of Albania, many [[Albanians]] migrated out of the area to escape either various socio-political and economic difficulties. Among them, the medieval [[painter]]s [[Marco Basaiti]] and [[Viktor Karpaçi]], [[Sculpture|sculptor]] and [[architect]] [[Andrea Alessi|Andrea Nikollë Aleksi]] and [[art collector]] [[Alessandro Albani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walker Art Gallery|title=Annual Report and Bulletin of the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-W0rAAAAIAAJ|quote=Andrea Alessi, architect and sculptor, was a native of Durazzo in Albania and possibly of local rather than Italian origin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babinger|first=Franz|title=L'origine albanese del pittore Marco Basaiti (ca. 1470 - ca. 1530),|journal=Atti. Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, Classe di Scienze Morali e Lettere|year=1962|series=CXX|pages=497–500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who resided in the [[Venetian Empire]] established the [[Scuola degli Albanesi]] that served as a cultural and social center for Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carol M. Richardson|title=Locating Renaissance Art|publisher=Yale University Press, 2007|isbn=9780300121889|page=19|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ac_Bbk8dLXUC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Albanian Renaissance]], in the field of arts, developed for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] in rather different directions especially toward the [[occident]] and was initially dominated by the central figure of [[Kolë Idromeno]]. Painters were searching for meaning, traditions and identity, leading initially to [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and later with [[impressionism]].

== History ==

=== Early period ===

[[File:Kamenica07-00.jpg|190px|thumb|right|An Devollian pottery from [[Kamenica Tumulus|Kamenica]].]]

Within the boundaries of Albania there have been several [[prehistoric]] Mediterranean cultures that left a number of pictoral records located in the Kryegjata Valley, [[Goranxi]], [[Maliq]], [[Konispol|Konispol Cave]], [[Urakë|Blaz Cave]], [[Gajtan Cave]], [[Treni Cave]] and numerous other sites throughout Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ceka|2013|page=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|2009|page=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Templer|2016|page=227}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|2009|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Templer|2016|page=221}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|2009|page=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Aleks Trushaj, Ermal Sina|title=The Particularity of Prehistoric Culture in Vlora Region (Albania)|url=http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/ajis/article/download/3069/3026|website=mcser.org|pages=1-8|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Bronze Age]], a number of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] tribes started to emerge itself on the territory of Albania and established several artistic centers at the same time. [[Terracotta]] was widely used by both cultures most notably for reliefs and other architectural purposes. Quite a number of terracotta figures, among others from the Illyrians, were found near [[Belsh]] but besides that as well throughout Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis of Illyrian terracotta ﬁgurines of Aphroditeand other ceramic objects using EDXRF spectrometry†|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/xrs.945/epdf?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_referrer=www.google.de&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|location=Tirana|page=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Bagnell Bury, Stanley Arthur Cook, Frank Ezra Adcock|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: The Augustan Empire, 43 B.C.-A.D. 69, 2nd ed., 1996 - Band 10 von The Cambridge Ancient History, Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards|publisher=University Press, 1996|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=1OTgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=illyrian+pottery+albania&amp;dq=illyrian+pottery+albania&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxspPF67TZAhWECewKHf-OATo4ChDoAQg-MAM|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bashkia Belsh|url=http://www.qarkuelbasan.gov.al/?crd=0,8,1,0,0,74&amp;ln=1&amp;uni=20101209233420201012092334129193|website=qarkuelbasan.gov.al|accessdate=10 December 2010|language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The art of [[pottery]] flourished also during that period and is considered amongst the most distinctive art produced from antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aleksandar Stipčević|title=The Illyrians: history and culture|publisher=Noyes Press, 1977|isbn=9780815550525|edition=Aleksandar Stipčević|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=NLcWAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=illyrian+pottery&amp;dq=illyrian+pottery&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia_oSL67TZAhWLy6QKHSU5B_kQ6AEINTAC|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various symbols, rituals, language and folklore were embodied in pottery art.

From earliest times [[mosaic]]s have been used to cover floors in principal rooms of buildings, palaces, and tombs, as well as in the formal rooms of private houses. The use of mosaic became widespread in [[Illyria]] and [[Ancient Greek colonies in Illyria|Ancient Greek]] colonies within the Illyrian coast on the [[Adriatic]] and the [[Ionian Sea]]. The earliest examples of mosaic flooring date to the ancient period are housed in [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]],
[[Butrint]], [[Tirana]], [[Lin, Korçë|Lin]], and [[Durrës]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ferid Hudhri|title=2.10. FINE /VISUAL ARTS|url=http://www.seda.org.al/download/i/mark_dl/u/.../2.10-VisualArts.pdf|website=seda.org.al|page=2|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The Beauty of Durrës|Beauty of Durrës]], the earliest mosaic discovered in Albania, is a [[polychromatic]] [[mosaic]] mainly made of multicolored [[pebble]]s.&lt;ref name="Enciklopedik"&gt;Fjalori Enciklopedik Shqiptar, Akademia e Shkencave - Tiranë, 1984 (MOZAIKU I DURRËSIT ME PORTRETIN E NJE GRUAJE, page 726)&lt;/ref&gt; It has a marvelous grace of its figure and great excellence of artistic creativity.

The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period is marked by the production of [[sculpture]]s presented as [[symbolic art]]. [[Roman sculpture]] was largely influenced by the sculptures of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and the [[Etruscan civilization]] whereas impressive examples can be mostly found in the cities of [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] and [[Butrint]], which flourished during that period.

=== Medieval period ===

[[File:Epitafi.jpg|160px|thumb|right|The [[Epitaph of Gllavenica]] is often considered the highlight of medieval Albanian art that was commissioned by [[Gjergj Arianiti]] in 1373.]]

When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided in the fourth century, most of [[Illyria]] remained in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] that was conventionally known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Byzantine art]], the art of the Eastern Roman Empire from about the 5th century until the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453, was predominantly marked by religious expressions and a renewed interest in techniques of the [[Roman Empire]] mixed with the themes of [[Christianity]].

[[Icon]]s and [[fresco]]es emerged as a significant art form with an extensive church building in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=L. Shumka from [[Agricultural University of Tirana]]|title=Considering Importance of Light in the PostByzantine Church in Central Albania|url=https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2013/november/8B_Considering.pdf|website=ijirset.com|location=Tirana|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They covered [[Sacred architecture|sacred building]] interior walls, floors and domes increased and expanded in size and importance. The use of [[Gold (color)|gold]] and bright [[color]]s was important indeed each color had its own value and meaning. In addition, colors were never mixed together but were always used pure.

The earliest icons of Albania date from the thirteenth century and generally estimated that their artistic peak reached in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="ByzantineAlbania"/&gt; No paintings before the thirteenth century, produced by Albanians, have been located to date.&lt;ref name="ByzantineAlbania"/&gt; Nonetheless few older structures in the country house different collections of paintings dating to the Byzantine period.

[[Illuminated manuscript|Manuscript]]s were another significant feature of Albanian medieval art. The handwritten [[Codex Beratinus]] and [[Codex Beratinus II]] are two ancient [[Gospel Book|Gospel]]s from [[Berat]], dating from the sixth and ninth centuries. They represent one of the most valuable treasures of the Albanian cultural heritage that was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2005.
 
By the fifteenth century after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and the invasion of [[Southeastern Europe]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]], art produced by [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] living in the [[Balkans]] was often named [[Post-Byzantine art]]. In that period many valuable monuments and artifacts were made by Albanian painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KONFERENCA E DYTË E STUDIMEVE ALBANOLOGJIKE|url=http://www.albanianorthodox.com/ikonografi/shkolla-e-korces.pdf|website=albanianorthodox.com|location=Tirana|page=2|language=Albanian|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voskopojë St.Nikolaos - Innenraum Fresko 4b.jpg|270px|thumb|left|[[Fresco]] of [[Saint Stephen]] by [[David Selenica]].]]

The most famous Albanian painter was [[Onufri]] who worked almost his entire life in Albania and Macedonia.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Onufri was distinguished for its rich use of colors and decorative shades with certain [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] national elements that are more visible with his successors [[David Selenica]], [[Kostandin Shpataraku]] and the [[Zografi Brothers]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; They lavishly painted diverse churches and monasteries throughout Albania and neighboring countries, especially visible in [[Berat]], [[Elbasan]], [[Voskopojë]], and [[Korçë]].

The [[Ottoman period in the history of Albania|Ottoman period]] of Albania during the fifteenth century is traditionally said to have had a negative impact on Albanian art and so the influences of [[Renaissance]] were extinguished. This influence was absorbed and reinterpreted with an extensive construction of [[mosque]]s that opened a new section in Albanian art, that of [[Islamic art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Edmond Manahasa, İlknur Aktug Kolay|title=Observations on the existing Ottoman mosques in Albania|url=http://www.az.itu.edu.tr/azvol12no2web/09-Manahasa-Kolay-1202.pdf|website=az.itu.edu.tr|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of art was usually portrayed by the highest degree of [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s, [[arabesque]]s and [[Ornament (art)|ornamentation]] of interlacing geometrical patterns of polygons, circles and interlocked lines and curves.

=== Albanian Renaissance ===
{{See also|Albanian Renaissance}}

[[File:Kole_Idromeno,_Motra_tone.jpg|160px|thumb|''[[Motra Tone]]'' by [[Kolë Idromeno]].]]

In the nineteenth century, a significant era for Albanian art begins. The great liberation acts starting with [[League of Prizren]] in 1878, that led to the [[Declaration of independence of Albania|Independence]] in 1912, established the climate for a new [[artistic movement]], which would reflect life and history more realistically and [[Impressionism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] came into dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=MaryLee Knowlton|title=Albania - Band 23 von Cultures of the world|publisher=Marshall Cavendish, 2004|isbn=9780761418528|pages=102–103|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=alNsb0fpX9IC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=impressionism+in+albania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fPpah7v3Kz&amp;sig=JGfwa8DMK_VAyq_75OHNgJni3qw&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj274SevZzZAhVDxxQKHQytBusQ6AEIUzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=impressionism%20in%20albania&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kolë Idromeno]] is perhaps the most famous of the Realist painters in the country and often considered as the introducer of Realism in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ferid Hudhri|title=Albania Through Art|date=2003|publisher=Onufri|location=Tirana|isbn=9992753676|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists captured the [[History of Albania|historical]] past and identity of [[Albanians]] in landscapes of vast forests, wide rivers, pristine lakes as well as portraits. Other artists have been focused on social criticism, showing the conditions of the people. By the early twentieth century, a radical artistic change occurred and experienced a patriotic renaissance. The year 1883 is dominated and celebrated for the creation of the most crucial and finest paintings The Portrait of Skanderbeg by Jorgji Panariti and [[Motra Tone]] by [[Kolë Idromeno]].

[[Impressionism]] did not make itself evident among Albanian artists until after 1900. It did inspired numerous painters among them Vangjush Mio, the first impressionist painter of Albania.

By the middle of the twentieth century, a [[communist]] government took rule over Albania and the artwork that arrived during the communist era reflects its time. Art was censored by the government and artists were urged to create works that endorsed [[socialism]]. The dominant theme of Albanian paintings was the [[proletariat]], the backbone of the socialist system. Much of the country's art focused on domestic scenes such as men working in the fields and women feeding chickens. Also, landscape scenes were highly popularized by Albanian painters.

=== Modern period ===
[[File:Detail_of_Painting_of_Female_Partisan_in_Battle_-_National_Historical_Museum_-_Tirana_-_Albania_-_01_(42748115122).jpg|thumb|Detail of female partisan in battle, National History Museum, Tirana, Albania]]
Although Albania left communism for democracy in 1991, scholars currently label Albanian artwork under the category of "[[socialist realism]]", for its emphasis on portraying real people and situations. Although much of Albanian artwork is influenced by [[impressionism]] and [[expressionism]], it is most [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] in its depiction of everyday life. Such works can be found at the National Arts Gallery of Albania and the National History Museum both located in Tirana. Contemporary Albanian artwork captures the struggle of everyday Albanians, however, new artists are utilizing different artistic styles to convey this message. Albanian artists continue to move art forward, while their art still remains distinctively Albanian in content.
 
Alt post-modernism was only introduced fairly recently among Albanian artists, there are a number of artists and works known internationally. Among the most famous Albanian post-modernists are [[Anri Sala]], [[Sislej Xhafa]], and [[Helidon Gjergji]].

Post-modern tendencies among Albanians were first spotted during the 1980s in [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.divus.cz/umelec/en/pages/umelec.php?id=1005&amp;roc=2003&amp;cis=3 |title=Shkëlzen Maliqi, Umelec Magazine |access-date=2009-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206231152/http://www.divus.cz/umelec/en/pages/umelec.php?id=1005&amp;roc=2003&amp;cis=3#clanek |archive-date=2008-02-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptures of national icons became popular throughout the country. In 1968, Sculptor [[Odhise Paskali]] (with help from fellow sculptors [[Andrea Mana]] and [[Janaq Paço]]) constructed a monument of [[Skanderbeg]], Albania’s national hero, in honor of the 500th anniversary of his death, and it is placed in the center of the capital city of [[Tirana]].

The Tirana Biennale is the main contemporary, international art event. Founded in 2001 by Edi Muka, Gezim Qëndro, and [[Giancarlo Politi]], it has enjoyed over the years the contribution of many international curators, like [[Francesco Bonami]], [[Adela Demetja]], [[Massimiliano Gioni]], [[Jens Hoffmann]], [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]], and [[Harald Szeemann]]. Many famous Albanian and foreign artists are usually invited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tica-albania.org/TICAB/ TICA]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dedications ==

Through different times, various [[visual art]] works of foreign artists throughout [[Europe]], such as [[painting]]s, [[portrait]]s, [[etching]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[relief]]s and works of other genres of art has been dedicated to [[Albania]] and the [[Albanian people]].

'''Arlene Klasky''' (born May 26, 1949) is an American [[animator]], [[graphic designer]], [[Film producer|producer]] and co-founder of [[Klasky-Csupo]] with [[Gábor Csupó]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Rugrats Duo Draws on Shared Vision |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=2000-11-17|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/17/business/fi-53187|accessdate=2010-08-24 | first=Claudia | last=Eller}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, she was named one of the “Top 25 Women in Animation” by ''[[Animation Magazine]]''. She is most known for her work with Nickelodeon in the 1990s and early 2000s. She, along with her ex- husband [[Gábor Csupó]] and [[Paul Germain]], co-created the animated series ''[[Rugrats]]''.

==History==
Klasky and her partner, Gabor Csupo, formed Klasky Csupo, Inc. in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= THE RUGRATS' REAL MOM AND DAD  |publisher= Business Week|date=|url= http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1995/b3446111.arc.htm|accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Combining their respective talents in graphic design and character animation proved to be a long-lasting successful formula.  Today, she continues to work on new project development for television and features.  She oversees the studio’s projects in broadstrokes on a daily basis along with Csupo.  Klasky was the creative force behind the box-office hits ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]''  and ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]]''.

Klasky played a major role as co-creator and executive producer on the three-time Emmy Award-winning ''[[Rugrats]]'' and designed several of the series’ major characters.  Her vision has inspired other distinctive productions, including ''[[Rugrats]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'',  ''[[Santo Bugito]]'', ''[[Rocket Power]]'' and ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]''.

Klasky’s diverse career shares common origins with the special effects/film graphics industry.  After studying animation at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], Klasky gained her first professional experience as a designer of signage and logos for architectural projects.  She entered the music industry as a designer for major record labels such as A &amp; M Records.

After stints as a magazine and advertising art director, Klasky made the transition into film, joining the legendary [[Robert Abel and Associates]] doing special effects and graphics for film.  She quickly progressed to freelance title design for New World Pictures and then for Marks &amp; Marks and California Film, another company she co-founded, designed on-air promos, station Ids and graphic titles.

==Personal life==
She was once married to her business partner [[Gábor Csupó]],  before they started their animation company. They have two sons together from their marriage. They remain business partners. [[Tommy Pickles]]' appearance from ''[[Rugrats]]'' is based on her younger son, Brandon. Her older son's name is Jarrett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ultimate Rugrats Fan Book |last=Graham |first=Jefferson |authorlink=Jefferson Graham |year=1998 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=0-689-81678-2 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Klasky Csupo==
{{Main|Klasky Csupo}}
[[Klasky Csupo]] was formed with Gábor Csupó in the couple's two-bedroom [[Hollywood]] apartment. It later was moved to Seward Street in Hollywood. They designed the logos for ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', ''[[Anything But Love]]'', and ''[[In Living Color]]''. They also produced music videos for [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Luther Vandross]]. In 1989, they started ''[[Rugrats]]'' with the unaired pilot "[[Tommy Pickles and The Great White Thing]]" and the series started in August 1991, and would go on to become one of nickelodeon's most iconic and successful television series, which would go on to receive a historically highly grossing feature film. ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'' premiered on Halloween in 1994, their second cartoon show to be aired on Nickelodeon. In 2003 she made the spin-off ''[[All Grown Up!]]''; in America it aired from 2003-2009 on The N, 2003-2006 on Nickelodeon, and 2004–present on Nicktoons TV.

'''Art of the Title''' ('''AOTT''') is an [[online publication]] dedicated to [[title sequence]] design, spanning the film, television, conference, and video game industries. The publication is both an educational and historical resource and a contemporary publication, focusing on the creative process behind the design of title sequences. It combines interviews with filmmakers and directors, designers, and craftspeople with in-depth analyses and behind-the-scenes materials.

==Overview==
Art of the Title is the leading online resource of title design, with hundreds of title sequences available to view. The site features title design from countries around the world and aims to "honor the creators and innovators who contribute to the field, discussing and displaying their work with a desire to explicate, facilitate, and instigate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = About the site | publisher = Art of the Title | date = 2012 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/about/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Independent]] has said that Art of the Title may well be the "best place to visit in search of more of these neglected wonders of film art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Time to give a little credit to the credits | publisher = The Independent | date = February 25, 2011 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/time-to-give-a-little-credit-to-the-credits-2224666.html | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Film Comment]] called the site "a praiseworthy and priceless compendium" in 2011, and said, "Art of the Title's greatest achievement has been to single out and champion the journeymen designers who painstakingly sculpt opening ephemera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Finnegan | first = Jesse P. | title = Site Specifics: ArtoftheTitle.com | publisher = Film Comment | date = 2011 | url = http://www.filmcomment.com/article/site-specifics-artofthetitle.com | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art of the Title staff have been invited to speak at industry conferences and festivals such as [[SXSW]], [[AIGA]], [[Promax Awards|PromaxBDA]], MODE Summit, Gamercamp,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A Brief History of Video Game Title Design | publisher = Art of the Title | date = November 5, 2013 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/news/a-brief-history-of-video-game-title-design/ | accessdate = May 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toronto International Film Festival|TIFF]] Next Wave, [[Nordic Media Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE TITLE SEQUENCE THAT SOLD THE SHOW|url=http://www.nordiskemediedager.no/en/program/the-title-sequence-that-sold-the-show/session/|website=Nordic Media Festival|publisher=Nordic Media Festival|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] Classic Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talks &amp; Events — Art of the Title|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/about/talks-events/|website=Art of the Title|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also done several talks in partnership with the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]'s Reel Comfort series.

In June 2017, site editors Lola Landekic and Will Perkins hosted a screening and discussion of films by designers and filmmakers [[Saul Bass]] and [[Elaine Bass]] at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linthicum|first1=Ryan|title=Movies at SAAM: Summer 2017|url=https://americanart.si.edu/blog/eye-level/2017/20/55908/movies-saam-summer-2017|website=Smithsonian American Art Museum|publisher=Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Art of the Title was founded by motion designer Ian Albinson and launched in 2007 as a blog intending to highlight the design of title sequences.

In 2008, Alexander Ulloa joined the site as Head Writer. Over the next few years, the site expanded with the addition of writers and editors Lola Landekic and Will Perkins, now Managing Editor and Senior Editor, respectively.

In 2011, the Art of the Title team curated the title design section of the ''Graphic Design — Now in Production'' exhibition, co-organized by the [[Walker Art Center]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Graphic Design: Now In Production | publisher = Walker Art Center | date = 2011 | url = http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2011/graphic-design-now-in-production | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition ran from October 22, 2011 – January 22, 2012 at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, and then was taken on a tour including stints in New York, Los Angeles, Grand Rapids, Houston, Winston-Salem, and Providence. A comprehensive, illustrated catalogue produced by the [[Walker Art Center]] and featuring an 18-page section on title design curated and written by Art of the Title accompanies the exhibition.

In 2012, the site launched a redesign developed in partnership with New Zealand-based studio CactusLab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 2012: The Year in Review | publisher = Art of the Title | date = December 31, 2011 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/news/2012-the-year-in-review/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The redesign adopted a responsive structure, allowing the site to "seamlessly adapt from desktop to mobile" and to provide "better cross-referencing of data alongside new bio pages for title designers and studios."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Art of the Title • Web Projects • Work • CactusLab | publisher = CactusLab | date = 2012 | url = http://www.cactuslab.com/work/art-of-the-title/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the site went down temporarily when its [[Iron Man 3]] article was linked from [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]'s Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 2013: The Year in Review | publisher = Art of the Title | date = December 31, 2013 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/news/2013-the-year-in-review/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, the site announced an exclusive look at the James Bond ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' title sequence, which turned out to be a [[rickroll]]. Readers' reactions ran the gamut from outrage to kudos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of the Title – NEW: An exclusive look... |url=https://twitter.com/ArtoftheTitle/status/583290327152250880|website=Twitter|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SXSW Title Design Awards===
From 2010-2014, Art of the Title facilitated and participated in the jury of the [[SXSW]] Excellence in Title Design Awards, part of the [[SXSW Film Festival]].

In 2013, Ian Albinson hosted a discussion at the title screening event, and then announced the winners at the Film Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 2013: The Year in Review | publisher = Art of the Title | date = December 31, 2013 | url = http://www.artofthetitle.com/news/2013-the-year-in-review/ | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Managing Editor Lola Landekic and Senior Editor Will Perkins gave a talk ahead of the Title Design Awards and hosted a discussion with filmmaker and designer Henry Hobson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolmar | first = Jim | title = Title Design Awards and Art of the Title Discussion Announced | publisher = SXSW | date = February 20, 2014 | url = http://sxsw.com/film/news/2014/title-design-awards-and-art-title-discussion-announced | accessdate = May 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been honored at the [[Guía de Isora]] Festival, [[MiradasDoc]], with an honorable mention, and also as best documentary at the [[Málaga Film Festival]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eldiario.es/catalunya/documental-caso-premiado-festival-Malaga_0_243925848.html|title=Un documental sobre el caso 4F, premiado en el festival de Málaga|work=eldiario.es|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Premiere ==

The documentary '''''4F: ni obit ni perdó''''' ("4F: neither forgetting nor forgiveness" in Catalan) was pre-screened in [[Barcelona]] on June 8, 2013 with an action of civil disobedience. This action consisted of the [[squatting|occupation]] by 800 people of a cinema closed 11 years ago, in the center of [[Barcelona]]: the ''Palacio del Cine'' of [[Vía Layetana]]. The cinema was renamed ''Cinema Patricia Heras''. ''Ciutat Morta'' includes images of the occupation of the cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20130609/54375821114/palau-cinema-documental-desmuntatge-4f.html|title=Cientos de jóvenes ocupan el Palau del Cinema para proyectar el documental sobre el 'caso 4F'|work=La Vanguardia|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/noticia/article/5-cultura/19-cultura/752311-poeta-morta.html|title=Poeta morta|work=El Punt Avui|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ciutat Morta'' was officially premiered on March 24, 2014 at the Malaga Spanish Film Festival.

== Synopsis ==

June 8, 2013. 800 people enter an abandoned cinema in the center of Barcelona in order to project a documentary. The old building is renamed ''Cinema Patricia Heras'' in honor of a girl who committed suicide two years earlier. But who is Patricia? Why did she decide to take her own life? How does her death relate to Barcelona? The answers to these questions are exactly what they want to publicize with this illegal action as well as a great media impact: to know the truth about one of the worst cases of police and judicial corruption in Barcelona.

=== 4F case ===

The night of February 4, 2006 ended with a police charge in the center of Barcelona. It was around an old busy theater where a party was being held. Among nightsticks hits, objects started to fall from the occupied house’s rooftop. As the [[Mayor of Barcelona]] reported on the radio a few hours later, one of the city policemen, who wore no helmet, was in a coma by the impact of a stone.

The arrests that came immediately after the tragic incident tell us the chronicle of revenge. Three young detainees, of South American origin, were severely tortured in police stations and later sent to provisional prison, being deprived of their freedom for two years, awaiting trial, without being able to clarify what they were accused of. Two other detainees that night - Patricia and Alfredo - deny they had been present at the scene: they were detained in a nearby hospital and found suspected because of the way they dressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lacriticanyc.com/ciudades-muertas-sistemas-deficientes/|title=Ciudades muertas, sistemas deficientes {{!}} La Crítica|website=www.lacriticanyc.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the evidence that exonerated all defendants, in the trial that was held against them, individuals were not being judged, but an entire collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cronicaglobal.com/es/notices/2014/06/ciutat-morta-9058.php|title=Ciutat morta|work=Cronica global|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a generic enemy built by the press and politicians of the model city Barcelona. Barcelona, had just released its so-called "civic ordinance," a hygienist law, a perfect legal framework for the [[gentrification]] plans of some downtown neighborhoods for tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diagonalperiodico.net/culturas/22488-ciutat-morta-videoactivismo-rompe-silencio.html|title='Ciutat morta': El vídeoactivismo rompe el silencio  {{!}} Periódico Diagonal|website=www.diagonalperiodico.net|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boys arrested that night were scapegoats that fit perfectly, for its aesthetics, with the image of the [[anti-system]] dissident: the internal enemy that the model city had been generating lately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://numerocero.es/cine/critica/ciutat-morta/2433|title=Ciutat morta - numerocero.es|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, the news appeared in the media that two policemen had been sentenced to prison, with sentences of more than two years, for having tortured a young Latin American in police stations. The conviction showed that officers lied and manipulated evidence during the trial. In order to cover up the torture they subjected to the young Latin American, they accused him of being a drug trafficker. However, in the course of the judicial inquiry the judge found that the accusation was false and was a police coverup: the young man was actually the son of the honorary consul of [[Norway]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and was in Barcelona studying for university studies. These officers turned out to be the same ones who had tortured the young detainees that night of February 4, 2006, in addition to having declared as witnesses against the defendants during the celebration of the trial. It became clear that the torturers used the same ''modus operandi'' in both cases. The only difference in the second case was the social origin of the victims: being the son of a diplomat, the tortured young man had a fair trial; Those accused of the process of February 4, 2006 did not have it. It is the umpteenth history of police impunity, accompanied by good doses of racism, classism and the violation of fundamental rights, all protected by a police-judicial apparatus and politicians obsessed with the real estate business that offers the Barcelona brand at the expense of its citizens.

=== Patricia Heras, the dead poetess ===

Beyond the city of Barcelona, the main character of ''Ciutat Morta'' is Patricia, who we get to know through her poetry, the testimony of her friends and her ex-partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eldiario.es/interferencias/Mantener-vida-poeta-muerta_6_274082620.html|title=Mantener con vida a la poeta muerta|work=eldiario.es|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a young student of literature, extremely sensitive, which hides her insecurities behind an eccentric aesthetic, fueled by the [[queer]] culture with which it is identified.

The experience that runs through that morning of February 4, 2006, when she is arrested along with her friend Alfredo in a hospital, gives a radical change to her life. Two years of anguish awaiting trial, exhausting all the savings of her life to pay lawyers. Three years in prison. Apart of shredding her life, these events trigger her literary productivity that is being recorded in a blog titled in a premonitory way: ''Poeta Muerta'' ("Dead Poet" in Spanish).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poetadifunta.blogspot.com/|title=poeta muerta|website=poetadifunta.blogspot.com|access-date=2017-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patricia commits suicide during a release from jail in April 2011. The authors of this film tried to pay homage.

== Dissemination and impact on the media ==

=== Licensing ===

The film is published under the [[Creative Commons]] BY-NC-SA 3.0 license.

=== Financing ===

The documentary ''Ciutat Morta'' was financed exclusively with a campaign of [[crowdfunding]] on the platform [[Verkami]] from microdonations, obtaining 4,720 € of the 4,211 € requested. The surplus was allocated directly to the support group to Patricia Heras and Rodrigo Lanza with the "''Des-Montaje 4F''" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.verkami.com/projects/994-ciutat-morta-des_montaje-4f/blog/955-exit-de-la-campanya|title=Èxit de la campanya – CIUTAT MORTA (Des_Montaje 4F)|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real cost, if all the expenses of realization had been covered, would amount to approximately €90,000.

=== Censure ===

The media minimized the coverage of its premiere and its winning prizes at different festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publico.es/politica/caso-mas-grave-torturas-barcelona.html|title=El caso más grave de torturas en Barcelona, silenciado por los medios|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV3 (Catalonia)|TV3]], the Catalan public television, refused the coproduction of the film once the shooting was concluded, and tried to delay as much as possible the airing of the documentary, even when it was offered to air for free. [[Eugeni Sallent]] (director of TV3) even lied about this fact in the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://directa.cat/actualitat/cinc-correus-electronics-demostren-que-director-de-tv3-ha-mentit-amb-relacio-al|title=Cinc correus electrònics demostren que el director de TV3 ha mentit amb relació al documental 'Ciutat Morta'|last=Directa|work=Directa|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the documentary was broadcast on January 17, 2015 on [[Canal 33|Channel 33]] in prime time but not in its full version, obtaining a [[screen share]] in [[Catalonia]] of 20% and an audience of 569,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vilaweb.cat/noticia/4227631/20150118/censura-dispara-lexpectacio-ciutat-morta.html|title=La censura dispara l'expectació per 'Ciutat Morta'|last=associats|first=Partal, Maresma i|work=VilaWeb.cat|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version broadcast on TV had around 5 minutes deleted, in compliance with a judicial ruling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://directa.cat/un-jutjat-de-barcelona-ordena-que-tv3-emeti-ciutat-morta-amb-cinc-minuts-de-censura|title=Un jutjat de Barcelona ordena que TV3 emeti 'Ciutat Morta' amb cinc minuts de censura|last=Directa|work=Directa|access-date=2017-05-26|language=ca-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was considered as a possible form of partial censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/tele/juzgado-censura-cinco-minutos-ciutat-morta-3860866|title=Un juzgado censura cinco minutos de 'Ciutat morta'|last=BARCELONA|first=EL PERIÓDICO /|date=2015-01-17|work=El Periódico|access-date=2017-05-26|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cleveland Centennial half dollar''' is [[early United States commemorative coins|a commemorative]] [[half dollar (United States coin)|United States half dollar]] struck at the [[Philadelphia Mint]] in 1936 and 1937, though all bear the earlier date. Sometimes known as the '''Cleveland Centennial Great Lakes Exposition half dollar''', it was issued to mark the 100th anniversary of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], as an incorporated city, and in commemoration of the [[Great Lakes Exposition]], held in Cleveland in 1936.

In the mid-1930s, commemorative coins were increasing in value, and Cincinnati businessman [[Thomas G. Melish]], a coin collector, lobbied Congress to authorize several new issues, of which he would be the sole distributor. He was successful with the [[Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar]], from which he profited greatly, and with the Cleveland piece. [[Brenda Putnam]] designed the Cleveland coin, which was approved by the [[Commission of Fine Arts]] after suggestions by sculptor [[Lee Lawrie]].

Melish distributed the Cleveland coins through the exposition, at local banks, and by mail order from his office in Cincinnati. Sales were good, and the full authorized mintage of 50,000 was struck.  Congress had inserted safeguards in the legislation to curb excessive profits, and though some of the coins were minted in 1937, there was no change of date, meaning collectors would only have to purchase one piece to have a complete set. Thousands remained in dealer inventories for years, and the coins remain inexpensive by the standards of commemorative coins of the era.

== Background ==
{{further information|History of Cleveland}}
After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the area known as the [[Western Reserve]], now in eastern Ohio, was the subject of dispute among the states, several of which claimed it as part of their territory. Although political rights to the area were given up to the federal government, Connecticut kept land ownership, and used part of its holdings to resettle those whose homes had been destroyed by the British during the war. The remainder was sold to the [[Connecticut Land Company]] in 1795. [[Moses Cleaveland]] was a surveyor, a lawyer, and one of the company's directors.  In 1796, by the shores of [[Lake Erie]], he set out a townsite that came to bear his name.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=111–112}} In 1830, a newspaper was founded, to be called the ''Cleaveland Advertiser''.  The editor found the name one character too long to fit in the printing form, and dropped the first "a" in Cleaveland—a change that was adopted by the public.  The town of [[Cleveland]] became a city in 1836.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=73–74}}

[[File:Melish picture.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Thomas G. Melish]]
[[Thomas G. Melish]] was a prominent Cincinnati businessman, who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company.{{sfn|Horning|p=30}}  Melish was also a coin collector, who came up with an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control.{{sfn|Bowers|p=329}} At the time, commemoratives were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=3–5}} The result was the 1936 [[Cincinnati Music Center half dollar]], an issue controlled by Melish and issued to commemorate a fiftieth anniversary that did not exist.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=329–330}} Melish sold only a few coins at the issue price, which was high, keeping back most for later sale once scarcity drove the price higher.{{sfn|Flynn|p=71}} By 1936, the market for U.S. commemorative coins had become, according to [[Q. David Bowers]], "as hot as a volcano",{{sfn|Bowers|p=26}} and "Congress gave [Melish] permission to have his own commemorative coins minted and to charge the public whatever he liked for them!"{{sfn|Bowers|p=18}} Melish, who had friends in Congress, had in early 1936 also tried to get lawmakers to authorize other commemorative issues that he would control.  The only one of these that came to fruition was the Cleveland Centennial half dollar.{{sfn|Bowers|p=338}}

== Legislation ==
A bill for a Cleveland Centennial half dollar was introduced into the [[United States Senate]] by Ohio's [[Robert J. Bulkley]] on March 23, 1936, and it was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Committee on Banking and Currency]].  The bill was to honor both the 100th anniversary of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, and the [[Great Lakes Exposition]], to be held there in 1936. The original bill would have provided for 50,000 pieces, which could be purchased from the [[United States Mint|United States Bureau of the Mint]] at any time, and could be struck by any or all of the three mints then in operation. The bill was reported back to the House by committee chairman [[Alva B. Adams]] of Colorado on March 26, drastically amended.&lt;ref name = "senate committee"&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 4335|publisher=United States Senate|date=March 26, 1936|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/result/pqpresultpage.gispdfhitspanel.pdflink/$2fapp-bin$2fgis-billtext$2fa$2f6$2fd$2f1$2f74-s4335-000rs-19360326.pdf+/4335,+74,+S.$40$2fapp-gis$2fbilltext$2f74_s_4335_rs_19360326$40Bill+Text$40Bill+Text$40March+26,+1936?pgId=236d0b6d-cfd0-48e0-9efe-96a07b009f11&amp;rsId=14EB0CC947E}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams had held hearings on other commemorative coins on March 11, 1936, and had separately been told of the abuses as issuers sought to get collectors to buy their coins.  These included getting additional designs authorized (as in the case of the [[Arkansas Centennial half dollar]]) and having the coins struck at all three mints. As the law required coins to bear the year of striking, and because [[mint mark]]s were used on coins produced at some mints, striking them in successive years at multiple mints created more [[Glossary of numismatics#V|varieties]] that coin enthusiasts would have to buy to keep their collections complete.{{sfn|Senate hearings|pp=11–12}} The committee heard of the [[Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar]], authorized in 1926 and still being struck in 1936, and of commemorative coins created with intentionally low mintages as a way of inflating profits.{{sfn|Senate hearings|pp=20–21}} When legislation for a Cleveland half dollar came before his committee, Adams struck the entire bill, after the [[list of enacting clauses|enacting clause]], and substituted a new version.  The original legislation had given the Cleveland Centennial Commemorative Coin Committee, controlled by Melish, discretion to have the new piece struck at any of the mints, at any time even over the course of years, in any amount up to the authorized limit of 50,000.  Adams's new text kept the total limit, but set a minimum of 25,000 that had to be issued. Adams's amendment required that all the coins be of a single design, be struck at a single mint (to be selected by the [[Director of the United States Mint|Director of the Mint]]).  It provided that all the coins be dated 1936 even if struck later, and that the Cleveland committee could purchase no less than 5,000 at a time.&lt;ref name = "senate committee" /&gt; In a separate report, Senator Adams noted that Bulkley's original bill "contains certain provisions which the committee recommends be eliminated not only from such bill but also from all subsequent bills relating to the issuance of commemorative coins."&lt;ref name = "senate report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Calendar No. 1805|publisher=United States Senate|date=March 26, 1936|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/result/congressional/pqpdocumentview:pdfannexevent?pgId=868a3376-8c06-40a1-ba30-8dc970c36e33&amp;rsId=14EB0C72BCD&amp;pdf=app-bin/gis-serialset/a/5/9/6/9988_srp1728_from_1_to_1.pdf}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill, as amended, passed the Senate without recorded vote on March 27, 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1936|4489|date=March 27, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The House of Representatives received the bill on April 1, and referred it to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was reported back to the House on April 16, having been amended to require the Cleveland committee to purchase not less than 25,000 coins at one time, eliminating the possibility that the committee could order an initial 5,000 and then fail to purchase any more.&lt;ref name = "house committee"&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 4335|publisher=United States House of Representatives|date=April 16, 1936|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/result/pqpresultpage.gispdfhitspanel.pdflink/$2fapp-bin$2fgis-billtext$2f9$2f1$2ff$2f7$2f74-s4335-000rh-19360416.pdf+/4335,+74,+S.$40$2fapp-gis$2fbilltext$2f74_s_4335_rh_19360416$40Bill+Text$40Bill+Text$40April+16,+1936?pgId=61263787-7724-4eba-87ec-23050d13c9a0&amp;rsId=14EB241A90A}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full House considered the bill on April 23, 1936, with the bill reported by [[John Joseph Cochran]] of Missouri as an emergency measure. When he asked for [[unanimous consent]] to pass the amended bill, Pennsylvania's [[Robert F. Rich]] asked how many coinage bills were going to be considered and if it would not be possible to consolidate a dozen of them into one bill.  Cochran replied that he had consulted with Ohio's [[Robert Crosser]] and been informed that "if we do not get the authority to print the coins now it will be useless".&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1936|6012–6013|date=April 23, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Bulkley moved that the Senate concur in the House amendments, which it did,&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1936|6048|date=April 24, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the bill was signed into law by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on May 5, 1936.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=315}}

== Preparation ==
[[Brenda Putnam]], a well-known sculptor, was engaged to design the coin.{{sfn|Bowers|p=338}}  On May 1, even before Roosevelt signed the legislation, the Director of the Mint, [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], sent sketches that had been submitted by Putnam to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]].  That commission had been charged by President [[Warren G. Harding]]'s 1921 [[executive order]] with rendering advisory opinions on the designs of public artworks, including coins.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v–vi, 190}} On May 2, commission chairman Charles Moore responded to Ross, giving preliminary approval, and stating that one of its members would work with Putnam as she prepared the necessary plaster models.  That representative was [[Lee Lawrie]], who suggested to Putnam that she use stars to represent the cities of the [[Great Lakes]] region.  Putnam had placed, on the map on the reverse, sketches of buildings to represent the sites of Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Toronto. When Lawrie wrote to Moore to report this and other progress, Moore joked about the coin having an enlarged star for Cleveland,
{{quote|
At funerals I hear read the Scriptures to the effect that "one star differeth from another in glory".{{efn|1 Corinthians 15:41}} So I suppose Miss Putnam's big star for Cleveland refers to the glory rather than the size of the city.  Well, as a voter in Detroit{{efn|Both Detroit and Chicago were and are larger in population than Cleveland.}} I don't mind, and probably no Chicago person will ever see one of the coins.  I am convinced that the whole movement is a coin-collector's racket that is going on all over the country.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=190–193}}
}}

Putnam's models were approved by the commission on June 2, 1936.{{sfn|Taxay|p=193}} The [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York reduced the models to half-dollar sized [[Glossary of numismatics#H|hubs]] from which coinage dies could be prepared.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=315}}

== Design ==
[[File:General Moses Cleaveland.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Moses Cleaveland, by an unknown artist|alt=The man from the coin, Moses Cleaveland, in an engraving. He is seen more fully than on the coin, facing slightly right, and wears late 18th or early 19th century garb.  He appears about 50 years old and has a sour expression on his face.]]

Putnam's obverse features Moses Cleaveland,{{sfn|Flynn|p=73}} in a depiction based on the only known portrait of him, by an unknown artist.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=48}} Surrounding Cleaveland are two lines of inscription, &lt;small&gt;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA * HALF DOLLAR&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;MOSES CLEAVELAND * LIBERTY&lt;/small&gt;. The designer's initials, "PB", are beneath Cleaveland's head. The reverse shows a map of the Great Lakes region with nine stars to represent its cities, listed from west to east: '''Duluth''', '''Milwaukee''', '''Chicago''', '''Toledo''', '''Detroit''', '''Cleveland''', '''Buffalo''', '''Toledo''' and '''Rochester'''. Cleveland gets the largest star, which is transfixed by a compass.{{sfn|Flynn|p=73}} Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their book on commemoratives, stated that "we have not found documentation, but we suspect that the compass was intended to show Cleveland as the center of industry within a radius of approximately 900 miles", thus encompassing, the authors suggested, not only the Great Lakes cities represented, but New York, Boston, Washington, and St. Louis.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=47}} The other inscriptions required by law appear in the upper right of the reverse, and &lt;small&gt;1836 GREAT LAKES EXPOSITION 1936 CLEVELAND CENTENNIAL&lt;/small&gt; surround the map.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=110}}

Numismatist David Bullowa, in his early work on commemoratives, stated, "the design of this issue is pleasing&amp;nbsp;... the obverse and reverse alike are sharply defined, interesting and not crowded".{{sfn|Bowers|p=338}} Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920s and 1930s."{{sfn|Vermeule|p=193}}  After complaining about the flat design and the large amount of lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, "the bust of Moses Cleaveland can only be described as commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, is nothing short of incomprehensible."{{sfn|Vermeule|p=193}} Nevertheless, Vermeule suggested that Putnam did the best she could to squeeze the required text onto a half dollar, and might have done better with fewer words to place.{{sfn|Vermeule|p=194}}

== Production, distribution, and collecting ==
[[File:1936 50C Cincinnati.jpg|thumb|450px|right|The [[Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar]], Melish's other coin.|alt=Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar]]
Melish, in his capacity as treasurer of the Cleveland committee, ordered 25,000 pieces in July 1936.  They were shipped from the [[Philadelphia Mint]], where they were struck, on July 20.{{sfn|Bowers|p=339}}  As well as those pieces, 15 coins were struck and set aside for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Swiatek|p=315}} Melish had arranged for the Philadelphia Mint to place the first 201 struck into individual numbered envelopes; these were later placed in special cardboard holders, the first by itself and each two thereafter together, with a notarized statement from Melish.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=316}}

The Cleveland Centennial and Great Lakes Exposition opened on June 27, 1936, and before it closed on October 4, some four million people passed through its gates.  Located on a 150-acre (61 ha) site by the shores of Lake Erie, there were artistic and industrial exhibits, as well as the usual amusements.{{sfn|Bowers|p=337}} The half dollars were sold at the fairgrounds, at Ohio banks, and by mail order from Melish's office in Cincinnati. Editor Lee Hewitt commented in the ''Numismatic Scrapbook'', "it seems strange that Mr. Melish, living in Cincinnati, should be the distributor of the Cleveland issue."{{sfn|Bowers|pp=338–339}} The Cincinnati Musical Center coin had quickly sold out, the pieces Melish allowed on the market many times oversubscribed,{{sfn|Bowers|p=339}} but for the Cleveland piece, "Melish's sales strategy had to be very different; the coins would have to be aimed at the Exposition visitors and the general public at $1.50 each, not at his own coterie of greedy speculators".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=48}}

Melish sent form letters to collectors warning that his committee had received offers from speculators to buy the entire issue and suggesting they act quickly to get their orders in.  By the end of July, Melish wrote that 24,000 pieces had been distributed and that the remaining thousand soon would be. Sales were good enough that in February 1937, Melish ordered the 25,000 pieces which remained from the authorized quantity.  In addition to those 25,000 coins, 15 more pieces were struck, intended for the 1938 Assay Commission.  Because of the legislation, the new pieces resembled the old exactly, including bearing the date "1936". So many were produced that thousands were hoarded by coin dealers.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=339–341}} In 1942, Melish offered 16,000 Cleveland Centennial half dollars to prominent dealer Abe Kosoff for any advance on face value.  Kosoff, who would, after Melish's death, auction his coin collection, declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1941, the Western Reserve Coin Club of Cleveland celebrated its 20th anniversary by [[Glossary of numismatics#C|countermarking]] 100 Cleveland Centennial half dollars with a special design.  The Secret Service objected, and many were destroyed. The club made similar markings for its 50th and 75th anniversaries, without government interference.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=316–317}} The Cleveland Centennial coin is the most common commemorative of the many different designs struck in 1936. [[R.S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2015, lists the issue at between $215 and $300, depending on condition.  An exceptional specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $4,700.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1150}}

The '''Coronation Carpet''' is a [[Persian carpet]] owned by the [[Danish Royal Family]]. It is stored at [[Rosenborg Castle]] in [[Copenhagen]]. According to the Royal Danish Collections, the carpet was made in [[Isfahan]] in the 17th century. The size is 12 feet, 2&amp;nbsp;inches by 17 feet, 1&amp;nbsp;inch. As the name suggests, it is the carpet on which Danish kings were crowned.

The carpet is made of silk pile and gold and silver threads.

The Coronation Carpet is only shown to the public once a year in the fall together with a small group of [[Chenille fabric|chenille]] carpets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7374">The '''Créteil International Women's Film Festival''' (in [[French language|French]] '''Festival international de films de femmes de Créteil''') is an annual event in [[Créteil]], [[Paris]], France founded by [[Jackie Buet]] in 1978 to showcase the directing talents of female filmmakers who, at the time, had difficulty getting their films adequately distributed. The first festival was held in 1979 in [[Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine|Sceaux]].&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;{{cite book| last = Kuhn| first = Annette|author2=Susannah Radstone| title = The Women's Companion to International Film| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pjqOM04aGJ8C| year = 1994| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-08879-5| page = 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It transferred to Créteil in 1985.&lt;ref name=Kuhn /&gt;

Located southeast of the center of the city of [[Paris]], today the festival is 10 non-stop days premiering 50 or more new films [[List of directors|directed]] by one or more women. The festival also offers film classes, thematic forums and debates. The competition is open to women from around the world who have made a feature-length documentary, a short length fiction and a documentary film. Their work is judged by a jury of 6 cinema professionals.

The festival offers a number of prizes including several Audience awards and the "Grand Jury Prize." There is a festival archive containing more than 10,000 films by women.

In 2005, recent directors featured include works from [[Hong Kong]], Butterfly by MAK Yan Yan, Ho Yuk by YAU Ching and Lim Poh Huat by [[Lee Wong]] from [[Singapore]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4642">A '''Daunian stele''' is a type of stone funerary monument constructed by the [[Daunians]], an [[Iapygians|Iapygian]] tribe which inhabited [[Apulia]] in [[classical antiquity]]. Daunian stelae were made from the end of the 8th century BC to the 6th century BC. They consist of a parallelepiped-shaped plate, which protrudes from the upper head and decorated on all four sides. Sizes vary between 40 and 130&amp;nbsp;cm in height, and consequently, between 20 and 80&amp;nbsp;cm in width while the thickness is between 3 and 12&amp;nbsp;cm.

==Description==
Daunian stelea were made from [[limestone]] in the southern part of [[Gargano]] where 2000 copies were found. Originally they were placed vertically on top of the [[mound]] covering the tomb, with a base devoid decoration that was stuck in the ground. Their decorations were executed with more or less deep incisions, a schematic representation of the deceased in their full dress funeral (decoration primary) accompanied by ornaments and abstract figurative scenes that form filler (secondary decoration).

The stars are divided into two categories depending on the presence of weapons in the depiction of the deceased, or ornaments. The first category would cover warriors, belonging to approximately 14% of the stelae found, while the second group, which includes all others, also includes the many stars which refer to female characters, approximately 6% of total stele found, which have a characteristic style with long braid on the back, also in depictions on pottery.

Figures with the ornaments as covering the whole body except the arms folded on the chest and covered with embroidered cotton gloves, and head covered with a tall conical hat that stretches to cover the neck. Among the deceased  ornaments are necklaces to more speed, large brooches and pendants long bracket composite chest, belt or pendant circular form of pomegranate and tapes, and pairs of large pendants in the center, and fermatrecce with three points for the circular female figures.
Warriors have a chest cardiophylax (plate protection for the upper chest) rectangular with concave sides, which is hung a sword "cross", kept in its scabbard and placed transversely to the hilt to the right, the spadapendono below the tape. The arms are always close to the chest, but with no ornaments. On the back, hangs a large shield round hoplite type, with "episema" (central theme) geometric (radial and vortex of the most common reasons) or, more rarely figured. The heads are in this case obtained in a separate block and insert the neck through a hole, have a circular shape and had to be covered by a helmet or other headgear.
The figurative scenes are rendered with subtle engravings and characters are both human and animals and fantastic creatures, and gods theriomorphic (depicted with animal features). They are engraved with scenes of funerals, with processions of bearers of offerings with containers on their heads, accompanied by a lyre player, but there are also representations of daily activities: fishing, sailing ships from sailing with square or, more rarely different types of hunting, both on horseback with the lance (deer hunting) and walk with the sling (birds). The stele of warriors often have processions of chariots or fight scenes, which were interpreted as funeral games in honor of the deceased, or hunting scenes and battles, which sometimes appear warrior with a helmet or mask in the form of bucranium three horns. Often there appear also fantastic animals ([[Pegasus|pegasi]], [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]] and [[sea serpent]]s, among others).&lt;ref&gt;Maria Luisa Nava, "Le stele della Daunia", in ''Atti del XIII Convegno di Studi Etruschi Italici'', Manfredonia 1980, Firenze, Leo Olski ed., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exploitation fiction''' is a type of [[literature]] that includes [[novel]]s and [[magazine]]s that [[wikt:exploitation|exploit]] [[sex]], [[violence]], [[drug]]s, or other elements meant to attract readers primarily by arousing prurient interest without being labeled as [[obscene]] or [[pornography|pornographic]].

Exploitation fiction grew out of [[Pulp fiction (genre)|pulp fiction]] of the 1930s and 1940s. It was popular "trash fiction" in the form of [[mass market paperback]]s in the 1950s and 1960s, when genuine, sexually explicit material could be seized as obscene. In the [[United States]], material that went by [[U.S. Postal Service|U.S. mail]] was subject to federal obscenity laws that greatly curtailed the distribution of materials that were sexually explicit or featured graphic violence. These cheap novels exploited violence, drugs, and sex—especially promiscuity and [[lesbianism]]—but rarely delivered the kind of salacious detail their cover art implied and generally tacked on moralistic endings to satisfy critics who accused them of having "no redeeming social value." They were often repackaged under new titles with different cover art, to resell to the unsuspecting public looking for cheap thrills.

As [[Motion Picture Production Code|film production codes]] loosened in the early 1960s, exploitation fiction led to [[exploitation film|exploitation cinema]] (again parallel to the development of ''giallo'' cinema), typified by [[Russ Meyer]] films.

'''Flexform SpA''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] company with its head office in [[Meda, Italy]], at the centre of the furniture production district of La Brianza. Founded in 1959 by the Galimberti brothers, the company designs, produces and markets furniture and furnishing accessories for residential and public use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2016-01-07/company-news/Flexform-One-of-the-greatest-Italian-quality-brands-partners-with-Satariano-Home-6736151401 "Flexform – One of the greatest Italian quality brands partners with Satariano Home"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early 20th century the Galimberti family opened an artisan workshop to build armchairs and sofas. In 1959 brothers Romeo, Pietro and Agostino Galimberti decided to call the activity Flexform di Galimberti, marketing their products in the local area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Sergio Campodall'Orto|title = Imprese eccellenti. Le aziende milanesi che non temono la crisi.|year = 2009|publisher = FrancoAngeli|location = Milano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 it became a public limited company and was transformed from an artisan workshop into an industrial firm. Collaborations began with Italian architects and creatives, many of whom destined to become the protagonists of Italian design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Giampiero Bosoni|title = Italian Design|year = 2008|publisher = Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Flexform entrusted the study of the brand to [[Pino Tovaglia]], the graphic designer who designed the Pirelli brand in the same years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Massimo Pitis, Cristina Dell'edera|title = Pino Tovaglia. La regola che corregge l'emozione|year = |publisher = Edizioni Corriani}}&lt;/ref&gt; while designer [[Joe Colombo (designer)|Joe Colombo]] created the [[:it:Tube Chair|Tube Chair]] armchair, which was subsequently exhibited in the permanent collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/484955|title="Tube" Chair|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s Flexform began to export abroad. Participating in the Cologne Furniture Fair in Germany, it made its name on the markets of Northern Europe. There followed years of economic expansion in Europe, which prompted the second generation of the Galimberti family to broaden its commercial horizons to the countries across the ocean. With the entry of the third generation, in the late 1990s exports were consolidated to Brazil, Russia, China, the USA and the countries of the Far and Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.casa24.ilsole24ore.com/art/arredamento-casa/2012-04-18/flexform-apre-otto-showroom-165740.php|title = Flexform apre otto showroom monomarca|publisher = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime the need grew to further diversify the offer to satisfy the tastes of the emerging markets. So 2001 saw the launch of Flexform Mood, a new collection of products with an international and retro style, initially coordinated by US designer [[John Hutton (designer)|John Hutton]].

Flexform has remained a family company. It has 135 employees and a plant covering an area of 30,000 square metres. All production continues to take place exclusively in Italy, in Meda, to keep the product Made in Italy, as it originally was &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://video.ilsole24ore.com/SoleOnLine5/Video/Impresa%20e%20Territori/Industria/IN-FABBRICA/2013/12/in-fabbrica-flexiform-7-gen/In-Fabbrica-flexiform-ok.php|title = Come nasce un divano|publisher = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designers==
Over the years, designers and architects including the following have been involved in the study of new products: Asnago-Vender, Sergio Asti, Cini Boeri, Joe Colombo, Paolo Nava, Rodolfo Bonetto, Carlo Colombo, Gigi Radice and Giulio Manzoni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Nally Bellati|title = New Italian design|year = 1990|publisher = Rizzoli|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last 40 years the entire collection has been coordinated by architect [[Antonio Citterio]].
In 2016 introduces the Adagio sofa designed by [[Daniel Libeskind]] {{Cite web|url = http://libeskind.com/work/adagio-sofa/|title = Adagio sofa}}.

"'''Frodo Lives!'''" was a popular [[counterculture]] slogan in the 1960s and 1970s, referring to the character [[Frodo Baggins]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The term was used frequently in [[graffiti]], buttons, bumper-stickers, T-shirts, and other materials. It was commonly associated with the [[hippie|hippie movement]]. Other examples of use include a ''Frodo Lives'' album released by [[Smash Records]] and merchandising items for the [[New Line Cinema]] [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]]. The phrase was also displayed during the activation of a computer virus in the early 1990s, in which the text 'Frodo Lives!' was displayed in large letters with a moving border.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/malware_Q-FRODO.COM Frodo Lives! virus in The Malware Museum on archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote = Hippies who may be pushing thirty wear buttons that read "Frodo Lives" and decorate their pads with maps of Middle Earth ...|source = —[[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Roszak| first = Theodore| authorlink = Theodore Roszak (scholar)| title = The Making of a Counter Culture: Reflections on the Technocratic Society and Its Youthful Opposition  | publisher = University of California Press| year = 1995| pages = 40| isbn = 0-520-20122-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term first became popular because of an increase in the availability and number of readers of the novel (which, up until that point, had been subject to rather mixed reviews) following release of the [[Ballantine Books]] paperback edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|carpenter}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no longer as pervasive as it once was, the term continues to appear regularly in newspaper articles and popular culture related to Tolkien's stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A62431-2001Dec18 | work=The Washington Post | title=Frodo Lives!

'''Funerary art''' is any work of art forming, or placed in, a repository for the remains of the [[death|dead]]. The term encompasses a wide variety of forms, including [[cenotaph]]s ("empty tombs"), tomb-like monuments which do not contain human remains, and communal memorials to the dead, such as [[war memorial]]s, which may or may not contain remains, and a range of prehistoric [[Megalith|megalithic]] constructs. Funerary art may serve many cultural functions. It can play a role in burial rites, serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife, and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead, whether as part of kinship-centred practices of [[ancestor veneration]] or as a publicly directed [[Dynasty|dynastic]] display.  It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind, as an expression of cultural values and roles, and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead, maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the lives of the living.

The deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention is found in almost all cultures—[[Hinduism|Hindu]] culture, which has little, is a notable exception.  Many of the best-known artistic creations of past cultures—from the [[Egyptian pyramids]] and the [[KV62|Tutankhamun treasure]], to the [[Terracotta Army]] surrounding the tomb of the [[Qin Shi Huang|Qin Emperor]], the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], the [[Sutton Hoo]] ship burial and the [[Taj Mahal]]—are tombs or objects found in and around them.  In most instances, specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy, although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods, usually from their possessions.

An important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the funeral ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the chapter "Tombs for the Living and the Dead", Insoll 176–87.&lt;/ref&gt; The treasure of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]], for example, though exceptionally lavish, was never intended to be seen again after it was deposited, while the exterior of the pyramids was a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators.  A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures, nearly all the art connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended for later viewing by the public or at least those admitted by the custodians.  In these cultures, traditions such as the sculpted [[sarcophagus]] and [[tomb monument]] of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires, and later the [[Christendom|Christian]] world, have flourished. The [[mausoleum]] intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the classical world, and later common in Islamic culture.

==Common terms==
[[Tomb]] is a general term for any repository for human remains, while [[grave goods]] are other objects which have been placed within the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, 58–59 characterizes [[Dismemberment|disarticulated]] human skeletal remains packed in body bags and incorporated into [[Formative stage|Pre-Classic]] [[Mesoamerica]]n [[mass burial]]s (along with a set of primary remains) at Cuello, [[Belize]] as "human grave goods".&lt;/ref&gt; Such objects may include the personal possessions of the deceased, objects specially created for the burial, or miniature versions of things believed to be needed in an [[afterlife]].  Knowledge of many non-literate cultures is drawn largely from these sources.

A [[tumulus]], mound, [[kurgan]], or [[long barrow]] covered important burials in many cultures, and the body may be placed in a sarcophagus, usually of stone, or a [[coffin]], usually of wood.  A mausoleum is a building erected mainly as a tomb, taking its name from the Mausoleum of Mausolus at [[Halicarnassus]].  [[Stele]] is a term for erect stones that are often what are now called [[gravestone]]s.  [[Ship burial]]s are mostly found in coastal Europe, while [[chariot burial]]s are found widely across [[Eurasia]]. [[Catacombs]], of which the most famous examples are those in [[Catacombs of Rome|Rome]] and [[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Alexandria]], are underground cemeteries connected by tunnelled passages.  A large group of burials with traces remaining above ground can be called a [[necropolis]]; if there are no such visible structures, it is a [[grave field]].  A [[cenotaph]] is a memorial without a burial.&lt;ref&gt;See any well-regarded survey of the [[history of art]] or of [[history of architecture|architecture]], such as ''[[Gardner's Art Through the Ages]]'' or the most recent edition of Sir [[Banister Fletcher]]'s ''A History of Architecture.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "funerary" strictly means "of or pertaining to a [[funeral]] or burial",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|funerary, adj. }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a long tradition in English of applying it not only to the practices and artefacts directly associated with funeral rites, but also to a wider range of more permanent memorials to the dead. Particularly influential in this regard was [[John Weever]]'s ''Ancient Funerall Monuments'' (1631), the first full-length book to be dedicated to the subject of tomb memorials and [[epitaph]]s. More recently, some scholars have challenged the usage: Phillip Lindley, for example, makes a point of referring to "tomb monuments", saying "I have avoided using the term 'funeral monuments' because [[Effigy#Funeral effigies|funeral effigies]] were, in the Middle Ages, temporary products, made as substitutes for the encoffined corpse for use during the funeral ceremonies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Phillip |last=Lindley |title=Tomb Destruction and scholarship: medieval monuments in early modern England |place=Donington |publisher=Shaun Tyas |year=2007 |isbn= 978-1900289-870|page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, have found this distinction "rather pedantic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Cockerham |title=Reformation, reaction, reception: a 21st-century view of monumental destruction |journal=Church Monuments |volume=23 |year=2008 |pages=137–41 (137) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related genres of commemorative art for the dead take many forms, such as the ''[[moai]]'' figures of [[Easter Island]], apparently a type of sculpted [[ancestor portrait]], though hardly individualized.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/h/hoa_hakananaia.aspx Hoa Hakananai'a] British Museum, accessed {{Nowrap|26 April}} 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  These are common in cultures as diverse as Ancient Rome and China, in both of which they are kept in the houses of the descendants, rather than being buried.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 47–48, on Ancient Rome. Stewart and Rawski's book is entirely devoted to Chinese ancestor portraits. See Chapter 1 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many cultures have [[psychopomp]] figures, such as the Greek [[Hermes]] and Etruscan [[Charun]], who help conduct the spirits of the dead into the afterlife.

==History==

===Pre-history===
{{Main article|Megalith}}
[[File:paulnabrone.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Poulnabrone dolmen]] in Ireland covered at least 22 bodies of the [[Neolithic]] period]]

Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Although the purpose of megalithic structures is not always clear, and of the very oldest, while [[Nevali Cori]] in Turkey contains burials, [[Göbekli Tepe]] appears not to.&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly [[megalith]]ic, the earliest instances date to within a few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the [[Iberian peninsula]] have been dated through [[thermoluminescence]] to c. 4510&amp;nbsp;BCE, and some burials at the [[Carnac stones]] in [[Brittany]] also date back to the fifth millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Mohen, 70&lt;/ref&gt; The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from the earliest, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of [[ancestor-worship]], a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.&lt;ref&gt;Mohen, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] societies, a great variety of tombs are found, with tumulus mounds, megaliths, and pottery as recurrent elements. In Eurasia, a [[dolmen]] is the exposed stone framework for a [[chamber tomb]] originally covered by earth to make a mound which no longer exists.  Stones may be carved with geometric patterns ([[petroglyph]]s), for example [[cup and ring mark]]s.  Group tombs were made, the social context of which is hard to decipher. [[Urn]] burials, where bones are buried in a pottery container, either in a more elaborate tomb, or by themselves, are widespread, by no means restricted to the [[Urnfield culture]] which is named after them, or even to Eurasia.  [[Menhir]]s, or "[[standing stone]]s", seem often to mark graves or serve as memorials,&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer, "Menhir", 348&lt;/ref&gt; while the later [[runestone]]s and [[image stone]]s often are [[cenotaph]]s, or memorials apart from the grave itself; these continue into the Christian period. The [[Senegambian stone circles]] are a later African form of tomb markers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1226 Stone Circles of Senegambia – UNESCO World Heritage Centre], accessed 28 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Egypt and Nubia===
{{Main article|Art of ancient Egypt}}
[[File:Egypte louvre 239 masque.jpg|thumb|Egyptian ceramic coffin mask|alt=An oversized, shallow mask depicting a large face. The face is roughly oval-shaped, but the top of the mask is a horizontal line just above the eyebrows, leaving the entire mask roughly triangular. The entire face is flattened, but the bulbous nose protrudes away from the face. The eyes are large and almond shaped, and both the eyes and braided eyebrows are disproportionally large in comparison with the mouth, which has full lips. The front of the face is clean-shaven, but below the chin, there is a long, narrow, pointed, braided false beard that was characteristic of ancient Egyptian royalty.]]

Egyptian funerary art was inseparably connected to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religious belief]] that life continued after death – even more, it expressed a belief that "death is a mere phase of life".&lt;ref&gt;Groenewegen-Frankfort, 80&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic objects and images connected with this belief were partially intended to preserve material goods, wealth and status for the journey between this life and the next,&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 37&lt;/ref&gt; and to "commemorate the life of the tomb owner&amp;nbsp;... depict performance of the burial rites, and in general present an environment that would be conducive to the tomb owner's rebirth."&lt;ref&gt;Kampen&amp;nbsp;et&amp;nbsp;al, 31&lt;/ref&gt; In this context are the Egyptian [[mummy|mummies]] encased in one or more layers of decorated coffin, and the [[canopic jar]]s preserving internal organs. A special category of [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts]] clarify the purposes of the burial customs.  The early [[mastaba]] type of tomb had a sealed underground burial chamber but an offering-chamber on the ground level for visits by the living, a pattern repeated in later types of tomb. A [[Ka statue]] [[effigy]] of the deceased might be walled up in a ''[[serdab]]'' connected to the offering chamber by vents that allowed the smell of [[incense]] to reach the effigy.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, 111–27, with ''serdabs'' 124–25&lt;/ref&gt;   The walls of important tomb-chambers and offering chambers were heavily decorated with [[relief]]s in stone or sometimes wood, or paintings, depicting religious scenes, portraits of the deceased, and at some periods vivid images of everyday life, depicting the afterlife. The chamber decoration usually centred on a "false door", through which only the soul of the deceased could pass, to receive the offerings left by the living.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, 51–55, 66–71, 218–19, and see index for other periods. Tomb styles changed considerably over the course of Egyptian history.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Representation (arts)|Representational art]], such as individual portraiture of the deceased, is found extremely early on and continues into the Roman period in the [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] [[Faiyum mummy portraits|Faiyum funerary portraits]] applied to coffins. However, it is still hotly debated whether there was realistic [[portraiture in Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Spanel, 23&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the life-sized [[reserve head]]s found in burial shafts or tombs of nobles of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth dynasty]] is not well understood; they may have been a discreet method of eliding an edict by [[Khufu]] forbidding nobles from creating statues of themselves, or may have protected the deceased's spirit from harm or magically eliminated any evil in it, or perhaps functioned as alternate containers for the spirit if the body should be harmed in any way.&lt;ref&gt;Atiya and El Shawahy, 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural works such as the massive [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] and two smaller ones built during the [[Old Kingdom]] in the [[Giza Necropolis]] and (much later, from about 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE) the tombs in the [[Valley of the Kings]] were built for royalty and the elite. The [[Theban Necropolis]] was later an important site for [[mortuary temple]]s and mastaba tombs.  The [[Kushite]] kings who conquered Egypt and ruled as pharaohs during the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth dynasty]] were greatly influenced by Egyptian funerary customs, employing mummification, canopic jars and ''[[ushabti]]'' funerary figurines. They also built the [[Nubian pyramids]], which in both size and design more closely resemble the smaller [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth dynasty]] pyramids at Thebes than those of the Old Kingdom near Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, Edwards ''et al'', 688–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Lower-class citizens used common forms of funerary art—including ''[[shabti]]'' figurines (to perform any labor that might be required of the dead person in the afterlife), [[Dung beetle#Scarab in ancient Egypt|models of the scarab beetle]] and [[ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary texts]]—which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;James, 122&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to tombs. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats and even military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Robins, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===

The man's robe is open, exposing his penis. He holds the hand of the woman.]]

The ancient Greeks did not generally leave elaborate grave goods, except for a [[Charon's obol|coin to pay Charon]], the [[Charon (mythology)|ferryman to Hades]], and pottery; however the ''epitaphios'' or [[Funeral oration (ancient Greece)|funeral oration]]&amp;nbsp;from which the word [[epitaph]] comes&amp;nbsp;was regarded as of great importance, and [[animal sacrifice]]s were made.   Those who could afford them erected stone monuments, which was one of the functions of ''[[kouros]]'' statues in the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic period]] before about 500&amp;nbsp;BCE.  These were not intended as portraits, but during the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic period]], realistic portraiture of the deceased was introduced and family groups were often depicted in [[bas-relief]] on monuments, usually surrounded by an architectural frame.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 212, 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The walls of tomb chambers were often painted in [[fresco]], although few examples have survived in as good condition as the [[Tomb of the Diver]] from southern Italy or the tombs at [[Vergina]] in Macedon.  Almost the only surviving painted portraits in the classical Greek tradition are found in Egypt rather than Greece. The [[Fayum mummy portraits]], from the very end of the classical period, were portrait faces, in a [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] style, attached to mummies.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes and Gahlin, 236&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Greek burials were frequently marked above ground by a large piece of pottery, and remains were also buried in urns.  Pottery continued to be used extensively inside tombs and graves throughout the classical period.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 26 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;  The great majority of surviving [[ancient Greek pottery]] is recovered from tombs; some was apparently items used in life, but much of it was made specifically for placing in tombs, and the balance between the two original purposes is controversial.  The ''[[Larnax (Archaeology)|larnax]]'' is a small coffin or ash-chest, usually of decorated [[terracotta]]. The two-handled ''[[loutrophoros]]'' was primarily associated with weddings, as it was used to carry water for the [[nuptial]] bath. However, it was also placed in the tombs of the unmarried, "presumably to make up in some way for what they had missed in life."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 57&lt;/ref&gt; The one-handled ''[[lekythos]]'' had many household uses, but outside the household, its principal use was the decoration of tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 135&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes of a [[descent to the underworld]] of [[Hades]] were often painted on these, with the dead depicted beside [[Hermes]], Charon or both—though usually only with Charon.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 391&lt;/ref&gt; Small pottery figurines are often found, though it is hard to decide if these were made especially for placement in tombs; in the case of the [[Hellenistic]] [[Tanagra figurines]], this seems probably not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 212–13&lt;/ref&gt; But silverware is more often found around the fringes of the Greek world, as in the royal [[Macedon]]ian tombs of [[Vergina]], or in the neighbouring cultures such as those of [[Thrace]] or the [[Scythians]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 149–50&lt;/ref&gt;

The extension of the Greek world after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] brought peoples with different tomb-making traditions into the [[Hellenistic]] sphere, resulting in new formats for art in Greek styles.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 151–54, and throughout the section on the period&lt;/ref&gt;  A generation before Alexander, Mausolus was a Hellenized [[satrap]] or semi-independent ruler under the [[Persian Empire]], whose enormous tomb (begun 353&amp;nbsp;BCE) was wholly exceptional in the Greek world – together with the Pyramids it was the only tomb to be included in the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].  The exact form of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], which gave the name to the form, is now unclear, and there are several alternative reconstructions that seek to reconcile the archaeological evidence with descriptions in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 126–27. Apart from those at the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] article, there are several from Lethaby's 1908 work [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Turkey/_Periods/Greek/_Texts/LETGKB/Mausoleum*.html here], and one illustrated in Boardman.&lt;/ref&gt;  It had the size and some elements of the design of the [[Greek temple]], but was much more vertical, with a square base and a pyramidal roof.  There were quantities of large sculpture, of which most of the few surviving pieces are now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 126–27&lt;/ref&gt;  Other local rulers adapted the high-relief temple [[frieze]] for very large sarcophagi, starting a tradition which was to exert a great influence on Western art up to 18th-century [[Neo-Classicism]].  The late 4th-century [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] was in fact made for another Hellenized Eastern ruler, one of a number of important sarcophagi found at [[Sidon]] in the modern [[Lebanon]].  The two long sides show Alexander's great victory at the [[Battle of Issus]] and a lion hunt; such violent scenes were common on ostentatious classical sarcophagi from this period onwards, with a particular revival in Roman art of the 2nd century.  More peaceful mythological scenes were popular on smaller sarcophagi, especially of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]].&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 172–73, 339–44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etruscans===

There is a marked contrast between the high relief busts of their upper bodies and the very flattened lower bodies and legs. They have almond-shaped eyes and long braided hair, and are smiling widely. The man has a beard that is bobbed. The woman's hands are gesticulating in front of her as if she was holding something that is no longer there, or perhaps gesturing while speaking. The man has his right arm draped around the woman's shoulders in an intimate pose, and his right hand on her shoulder also appears to once have held some item. His left hand rests palm up in the crook of the woman's left elbow.
]]

Objects connected with death, in particular [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] and [[cinerary urn]]s, form the basis of much of current knowledge of the ancient [[Etruscan civilization]] and [[Etruscan art|its art]], which once competed with the [[culture of ancient Rome]], but was eventually absorbed into it.&lt;ref&gt;Holiday, 73&lt;/ref&gt; The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often incorporate a reclining image of the deceased. The reclining figures in some Etruscan funerary art are shown using the ''[[mano cornuta]]'' to protect the grave.&lt;ref&gt;de&amp;nbsp;Grummond 1997, 359&lt;/ref&gt;

The motif of the funerary art of the 7th and 6th centuries&amp;nbsp;BCE was typically a feasting scene, sometimes with dancers and musicians, or athletic competitions. Household bowls, cups, and pitchers are sometimes found in the graves, along with food such as eggs, pomegranates, honey, grapes and olives for use in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;de&amp;nbsp;Grummond 2006, 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de&amp;nbsp;Grummond&amp;nbsp;1997,&amp;nbsp;93&lt;/ref&gt; From the 5th century, the mood changed to more somber and gruesome scenes of parting, where the deceased are shown leaving their loved ones,&lt;ref&gt;Johnston,&amp;nbsp;489&lt;/ref&gt; often surrounded by underworld demons, and psychopomps, such as [[Charun]] or the winged female [[Vanth]]. The underworld figures are sometimes depicted as gesturing impatiently for a human to be taken away.&lt;ref name="D1985"&gt;Davies, 632&lt;/ref&gt; The handshake was another common motif, as the dead took leave of the living.&lt;ref name="D1985" /&gt; This often took place in front of or near a closed double doorway, presumably the portal to the underworld. Evidence in some art, however, suggests that the "handshake took place at the other end of the journey, and represents the dead being greeted in the Underworld".&lt;ref name="D1985" /&gt;

=== Ancient Rome ===

Marble, Roman artwork from the 1st century BC imitating the Greek classical style of the 5th century BC. From [[Rhodes]].]]

The burial customs of the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] were influenced by both of the first significant cultures whose territories they conquered as their state expanded, namely the Greeks of [[Magna Graecia]] and the Etruscans.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Chapter I&lt;/ref&gt;  The original Roman custom was [[cremation]], after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, ash-chest or urn, often in a ''[[columbarium]]''; pre-Roman burials around Rome often used hut-urns—little pottery houses.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 15&lt;/ref&gt;  From about the 2nd century&amp;nbsp;CE, [[inhumation]] (burial of unburnt remains) in sarcophagi, often elaborately carved, became more fashionable for those who could afford it.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;  Greek-style medallion portrait sculptures on a ''stela'', or small mausoleum for the rich, housing either an urn or sarcophagus, were often placed in a location such as a roadside, where it would be very visible to the living and perpetuate the memory of the dead.  Often a couple are shown, signifying a longing for reunion in the afterlife rather than a double burial (see [[married couple funerary reliefs]]).&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Chapter IV; Hall, 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In later periods, life-size sculptures of the deceased reclining as though at a meal or social gathering are found, a common Etruscan style.  Family tombs for the grandest late Roman families, like the [[Tomb of the Scipios]], were large mausoleums with facilities for visits by the living, including kitchens and bedrooms.  The [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], built for [[Hadrian]], was later converted into a fortress.  Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 38&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancestor portraits, usually in the form of wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little cupboards,&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 31&amp;nbsp;(illustration)&lt;/ref&gt; although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the ''[[Domus|atrium]]''.  They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Polybius]].  Pliny also describes the custom of having a bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield (''[[clipeus]]''), and having it hung in a temple or other public place.  No examples of either type have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 15, 35, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] there was considerable competition among wealthy Romans for the best locations for tombs, which lined all the approach roads to the city up to the walls, and a variety of exotic and unusual designs sought to catch the attention of the passer-by and so perpetuate the memory of the deceased and increase the prestige of their family.  Examples include the [[Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker]], a [[freedman]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the Mausoleum of [[Caecilia Metella (daughter of Metellus Creticus)|Caecilia Metella]], all built within a few decades of the start of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, 95–105; see also Boardman, 240–41 on Eurysaces' tomb.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, sarcophagi were mostly intended to be set against the wall of the tomb, and only decorated on three sides, in contrast to the free-standing styles of Greece and the Eastern Empire. The relief scenes of Hellenistic art became even more densely crowded in later Roman sarcophagi, as for example in the 2nd-century [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]], and various styles and forms emerged, such as the columnar type with an "architectural background of columns and niches for its figures".&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 339&lt;/ref&gt;  A well-known Early Christian example is the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], used for an important new convert who died in 359. Many sarcophagi from leading centres were exported around the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 339–44; Hall, 78–80&lt;/ref&gt;  The Romans had already developed the expression of religious and philosophical ideas in narrative scenes from [[Greek mythology]], treated [[allegorically]];&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 54–61&lt;/ref&gt; they later transferred this habit to Christian ideas, using  biblical scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 77–82&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===

Funerary art varied greatly across Chinese history. Tombs of early rulers rival the ancient Egyptians for complexity and value of grave goods, and have been similarly pillaged over the centuries by [[tomb robber]]s.  For a long time, literary references to [[jade burial suit]]s were regarded by scholars as fanciful myths, but a number of examples were excavated in the 20th century, and it is now believed that they were relatively common among early rulers.  Knowledge of pre-dynastic Chinese culture has been expanded by spectacular discoveries at [[Sanxingdui]] and other sites.  Very large tumuli could be erected, and later, mausoleums.  Several special large shapes of [[Shang dynasty]] [[Chinese ritual bronzes|bronze ritual vessels]] were probably made for burial only; large numbers were buried in elite tombs, while other sets remained above ground for the family to use in making offerings in [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration rituals]].  The [[Tomb of Fu Hao]] (c. BCE&amp;nbsp;1200) is one of the few undisturbed royal tombs of the period to have been excavated—most funerary art has appeared on the art market without archaeological context.&lt;ref&gt;See for example  Merriman, 297&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery in 1974 of the [[Terracotta army]] located the tomb of the [[First Qin Emperor]] (died 210&amp;nbsp;BCE), but the main tumulus, of which literary descriptions survive,  has not been excavated.  Remains surviving above ground from several imperial tombs of the [[Han dynasty]] show traditions maintained until the end of imperial rule.  The tomb itself is an "underground palace" beneath a sealed tumulus surrounded by a wall, with several buildings set at some distance away down avenues for the observation of rites of veneration, and the accommodation of both permanent staff and those visiting to perform rites, as well as gateways, towers and other buildings.

[[File:SAM Art Ladder military guardian.jpg|thumb|upright|"Military Guardian", Chinese funerary statue. Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington.]]
[[Tang dynasty tomb figures]], in "three-colour" ''[[sancai]]'' glazes or overglaze paint, show a wide range of servants, entertainers, animals and fierce tomb guardians between about 12 and 120 cm high, and were arranged around the tomb, often in niches along the sloping access path to the underground chamber. 

Chinese imperial tombs are typically  approached by a "[[spirit way|spirit road]]", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A  tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of [[Bixi (mythology)|Bixi]] in the form of a [[tortoise]], is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of "lions" and "[[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]]s"; in later periods they are much more varied.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman and Soper, 57–66; see also [https://books.google.com/books?id=4gNk5HzIIKgC&amp;pg=PA31 the diagram here]&lt;/ref&gt;  A looted tomb with fine paintings is the [[Empress Dowager Wenming tomb]] of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century [[Tang dynasty]] [[Qianling Mausoleum]] group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman and Soper, 155&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[complex of Goguryeo Tombs]], from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern [[Korea]], are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the [[Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties]] has been excavated, in 1956, with such [[Ming tombs#Excavation of Dingling tomb|disastrous results]] for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;Evasdottir, 158–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum]] in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of [[Jiaxiang County]], Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.&lt;ref&gt;Wu Hung, The Wu Liang Shrine: The Ideology of Early Chinese Pictorial Art (Stanford UPP, 1989))&lt;/ref&gt;  The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period.  A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman and Soper, 77–84&lt;/ref&gt;  After the introduction of Buddhism, carved "funerary couches" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman and Soper, 120–21&lt;/ref&gt; During the Han Dynasty, [[Science and technology of the Han Dynasty#Ceramic model buildings|miniature ceramic models]] of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture. Later, during the [[Six Dynasties]], sculptural miniatures depicting buildings, monuments, people and animals adorned the tops of the ''[[hunping]]'' funerary vessels.&lt;ref name=dien&gt;Dien, 214–15&lt;/ref&gt;  The outsides of tombs often featured monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que 闕); an example from 121&amp;nbsp;CE appears to be the earliest surviving Chinese architectural structure standing above ground.&lt;ref&gt;Sickman and Soper, 376 (illustrated)&lt;/ref&gt;  Tombs of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) are often rich in glazed pottery figurines of horses, servants and other subjects, whose forceful and free style is greatly admired today. The tomb art reached its peak in the Song and Jin periods; most spectacular tombs were built by rich commoners.&lt;ref&gt;Jeehee Hong, "Virtual Theater of the Dead: Actor Figurines and Their Stage in Houma Tomb No.1," Artibus Asiae Vol. 71-1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Early burial customs show a strong belief in an afterlife and a spirit path to it that needed facilitating.  Funerals and memorials were also an opportunity to reaffirm such important cultural values as [[filial piety]] and "the honor and respect due to seniors, the duties incumbent on juniors"&lt;ref&gt;Thorp &amp;amp;  Vinograd, 144&lt;/ref&gt; The common Chinese funerary symbol of a woman in the door may represent a "basic male fantasy of an elysian afterlife with no restrictions: in all the doorways of the houses stand available women looking for newcomers to welcome into their chambers"&lt;ref&gt;Goldin, 548&lt;/ref&gt; Han Dynasty inscriptions often describe the filial mourning for their subjects,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 44&lt;/ref&gt; for example text from a funeral [[stele]] for the daughter of a [[scholar-official]] of the dynasty, which described the "hurt and grief" of her two sons:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korea===
[[File:Goguryeo tomb mural.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Hunting scene from the North wall of the main chamber of the Muyongchong Tomb (Tomb of the Dancers), (5th century CE), [[Ji'an, Jilin|Ji'an]].]]
Murals painted on the walls of the [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|Goguryeo Tombs]] are examples of Korean painting from its [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] era. Although thousands of these tombs have been found, only about 100 have murals.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, ''Preservation of the Koguryo Kingdom Tombs'', 24&lt;/ref&gt; These tombs are often named for the dominating theme of the murals – these include the Tomb of the Dancers, the Tomb of the Hunters, the Tomb of the Four Spirits, and the Tomb of the Wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 64&lt;/ref&gt; Heavenly bodies are a common motif, as are depictions of events from the lives of the royalty and nobles whose bodies had been entombed. The former include the sun, represented as a [[three-legged bird]] inside a wheel,&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, ''Preservation of the Koguryo Kingdom Tombs'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; and the various constellations, including especially the [[Four Symbols (Chinese constellation)|Four directional constellations]]: the [[Azure Dragon]] of the East, the [[Vermilion Bird]] of the South, the [[White Tiger (Chinese constellation)|White Tiger]]  of the West, and the [[Black Tortoise]] of the North.&lt;ref&gt;Park 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty]] in [[Korea]], built between 1408 and 1966, reflect a combination of Chinese and Japanese traditions, with a tomb mound, often surrounded by a screen wall of stone blocks, and sometimes with stone animal figures above ground, not unlike the Japanese ''haniwa'' figures (see below).  There is usually one or more T-shaped shrine buildings some distance in front of the tomb, which is set in extensive grounds, usually with a hill behind them, and facing a view towards water and distant hills.  They are still a focus for [[ancestor worship]] rituals.  From the 15th century, they became more simple, while retaining a large landscape setting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1319/ Unesco] Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[File:Caballo Haniwa Guimet 01.JPG|thumb|6th-century Japanese ''[[haniwa]]'' clay figure; these were buried with the dead in the [[Kofun]] period (3rd to 6th centuries CE)]]
The [[Kofun period]] of Japanese history, from the 3rd to 6th centuries CE, is named after ''[[kofun]]'', the often enormous keyhole-shaped Imperial mound-tombs, often on a moated island.  None of these have ever been allowed to be excavated, so their possibly spectacular contents remain unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 287–89&lt;/ref&gt;   Late examples which have been investigated, such as the [[Kitora Tomb]], had been robbed of most of their contents, but the [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]] retains mural paintings.  Lower down the social scale in the same period, [[terracotta]] ''haniwa'' figures, as much as a metre high, were deposited on top of aristocratic tombs as grave markers, with others left inside, apparently representing possessions such as horses and houses for use in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 24–26, 280–82&lt;/ref&gt;  Both ''kofun'' mounds and ''haniwa'' figures appear to have been discontinued as Buddhism became the dominant Japanese religion.&lt;ref&gt;Paine and Soper, 289. See also [[List of National Treasures of Japan (archaeological materials)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Japanese tombs have been typically marked by elegant but simple rectangular vertical gravestones with inscriptions.  Funerals are one of the areas in Japanese life where Buddhist customs are followed even by those who followed other traditions, such as [[Shinto]].  The ''[[bodaiji]]'' is a special and very common type of temple whose main purpose is as a venue for rites of ancestor worship, though it is often not the actual burial site.  This was originally a custom of the feudal lords, but was adopted by other classes from about the 16th century. Each family would use a particular ''bodaiji'' over generations, and it might contain a second "grave" if the actual burial were elsewhere.  Many later emperors, from the 13th to 19th centuries, are buried simply at the Imperial ''bodaiji'', the [[Tsuki no wa no misasagi]] mausoleum in the [[Sennyū-ji]] temple at [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall, John Whitney, 381–86&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===

They surround one musician in the centre of the ring, and a second musician stands behind them.]]
Unlike many Western cultures, that of [[Mesoamerica]] is generally lacking in [[sarcophagi]], with a few notable exceptions such as that of [[Pacal the Great]] or the now-lost sarcophagus from the [[Olmec]] site of [[La Venta]].  Instead, most Mesoamerican funerary art takes the form of grave goods and, in [[Oaxaca]], [[funerary urn]]s holding the ashes of the deceased. Two well-known examples of Mesoamerican grave goods are those from [[Jaina Island]], a [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site off the coast of [[Campeche]], and those associated with the [[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition]].&lt;!-- read the FAC before putting a {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} tag here --&gt;  The tombs of Mayan rulers can only normally be identified by inferences drawn from the lavishness of the grave goods and, with the possible exception of vessels made from stone rather than pottery, these appear to contain no objects specially made for the burial.&lt;ref&gt;Chase and Chase, Chapter 3, especially p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Funerary Mask, 300 B.C.E.-1.,64.94.jpg|thumb|Funerary Mask, c. 300 BC, painted ceramic]]
The Jaina Island graves are noted for their abundance of clay figurines.  Human remains within the roughly 1,000 excavated graves on the island (out of 20,000 total)&lt;ref&gt;Muren.&lt;/ref&gt; were found to be accompanied by glassware, slateware, or pottery, as well as one or more ceramic figurines, usually resting on the occupant's chest or held in their hands.  The function of these figurines is not known: due to gender and age mismatches, they are unlikely to be portraits of the grave occupants, although the later figurines are known to be representations of goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called shaft tomb tradition of western Mexico is known almost exclusively from grave goods, which include hollow ceramic figures, obsidian and shell jewelry, pottery, and other items (see [https://www.flickr.com/photos/petwerewolf/85154232/ this Flickr photo] for a reconstruction).  Of particular note are the various ceramic tableaux including village scenes, for example, players engaged in a [[Mesoamerican ballgame]].  Although these tableaux may merely depict village life, it has been proposed that they instead (or also) depict the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;See Taylor for discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic dogs are also widely known from looted tombs, and are thought by some to represent [[psychopomp]]s (soul guides),&lt;ref&gt;Coe et al., 103–104, or Mason, 182. In Richardson, 48–49 ("The dog, among the Maya, was considered to be connected with death, and to be the messenger to prepare the way to the hereafter.")&lt;/ref&gt; although dogs were often the major source of protein in ancient Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, 45 ("The only domestic animals were dogs—the principal source of meat for much of Preclassic Mesoamerica—and turkeys—understandably rare because that familiar bird consumes very large quantities of corn and is thus expensive to raise".)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Funerary Urn from Oaxaca.jpg|right|thumb|A funerary urn in the shape of a "bat god" or a jaguar, from Oaxaca, dated to AD&amp;nbsp;300–650.&lt;ref&gt;Height: 9.5&amp;nbsp;in (23&amp;nbsp;cm). "The Bat God was one of the important deities of the Maya, many elements of whose religion were shared also by the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]]. The Bat God in particular is known to have been revered also by the Zapotec&amp;nbsp;... He was especially associated&amp;nbsp;... with the underworld." Mason, 182.

The head and face appear like that of a bat with a shortened snout, ridged eyebrows and very large round ears. Its mouth is open, showing pointed teeth and a protruding tongue. It wears a necklace made of two braided ropes, with an amulet in the front shaped the head of a double axe (or a bow tie). However, its body is not bat-like. It squats on four legs each with four clawed toes, with a perfectly round belly.]]
The [[Zapotec civilization]] of Oaxaca is particularly known for its clay funerary urns, such as the "bat god" shown at right.  Numerous types of urns have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, 163&lt;/ref&gt; While some show deities and other supernatural beings, others seem to be portraits.  Art historian [[George Kubler]] is particularly enthusiastic about the craftsmanship of this tradition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No other American potters ever explored so completely the plastic conditions of wet clay or retained its forms so completely after firing&amp;nbsp;... [they] used its wet and ductile nature for fundamental geometric modelling and cut the material, when half-dry, into smooth planes with sharp edges of an unmatched brilliance and suggestiveness of form.&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Maya [[Naj Tunich]] cave tombs and other sites contain paintings, carved stelae, and grave goods in pottery, [[jade]] and metal, including [[death mask]]s. In dry areas, many ancient textiles have been found in graves from South America's [[Paracas culture]], which wrapped its mummies tightly in several layers of elaborately patterned cloth.  Elite [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] graves, containing especially fine pottery, were incorporated into large [[adobe]] structures also used for [[human sacrifice]]s, such as the [[Huaca de la Luna]].  [[Cultural periods of Peru|Andean cultures]] such as the [[Sican Culture|Sican]] often practiced mummification and left grave goods in precious metals with jewels, including [[tumi]] ritual knives and gold funerary masks, as well as pottery.

The Mimbres of the [[Mogollon culture]] buried their dead with bowls on top of their heads and ceremonially "killed" each bowl with a small hole in the centre so that the deceased's spirit could rise to another world. Mimbres [[Mogollon culture#Mimbres pottery|funerary bowls]] show scenes of hunting, gambling, planting crops, fishing, sexual acts and births.&lt;ref&gt;Giammattei  and Reichert, 3.

Some of the [[Mound builder (people)|North American mounds]], such as [[Grave Creek Mound]] (c. 250–150&amp;nbsp;BCE) in [[West Virginia]], functioned as burial sites, while others had different purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvculture.org/history/mounds.html Mounds &amp; Mound Builders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623005836/http://www.wvculture.org/history/mounds.html |date=23 June 2008 }} Accessed 25 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional societies==
[[File:Burial Site 2.jpg|thumb|left|A stone-carved [[Toraja]] cliff burial site. ''Tau tau'' (effigies of the deceased) look out over the land.]]
There is an enormous diversity of funeral art from traditional societies across the world, much of it in perishable materials, and some is mentioned elsewhere in the article.  In traditional African societies, [[African traditional masks|masks]] often have a specific association with death, and some types may be worn mainly or exclusively for funeral ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qmvR2YVCtLEC&amp;pg=PA133 Masks in West African Traditional Societies], Bonnefoy, pp. 133–37&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral ceremonies of the [[Indigenous Australians]] typically feature [[body painting]]; the [[Yolngu]] and [[Tiwi people|Tiwi]] people create carved ''[[pukumani]]'' burial poles from [[ironwood]] trunks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3622670/Viewfinder-Aboriginal-burial-poles.html|title=Viewfinder: Aboriginal burial poles|last=Davies|first=Serena|date=23 August 2004|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while elaborately carved [[burial tree]]s have been used in south-eastern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Oxenham.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Toraja]] people of central [[Sulawesi]] are famous for [[Toraja#Funeral rites|their burial practices]], which include the setting-up of effigies of the dead on cliffs.  The 19th- and 20th-century royal [[Kasubi Tombs]] in [[Uganda]], destroyed by fire in 2010, were a circular compound of thatched buildings similar to those inhabited by the earlier [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]]s when alive, but with special characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kasubitombs.org/en/description/index.php Kasubi tombs website]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop.jpg|right|thumb|Custom coffins displayed at the [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop]] in [[Teshie]]]]

==Funerary art and religion==

===Hinduism===
[[Cremation]] is traditional among Hindus, who also believe in [[reincarnation]], and there is far less of a tradition of funerary monuments in Hinduism than in other major religions.&lt;ref&gt;Groseclose, 23&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are regional, and relatively recent, traditions among royalty, and the ''samādhi mandir'' is a memorial temple for a saint.  Both may be influenced by Islamic practices.  The mausoleums of the kings of [[Orchha]], from the 16th century onwards, are among the best known. Other rulers were commemorated by memorial temples of the normal type for the time and place, which like similar buildings from other cultures fall outside the scope of this article, though [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]], the most spectacular of all, must be mentioned.

===Buddhism===
Buddhist tombs themselves are typically simple and modest, although they may be set within temples, sometimes large complexes, built for the purpose in the then-prevailing style.  According to tradition, the remains of the [[Buddha]]'s body after [[cremation]] were entirely divided up into relics (''[[cetiya]]''), which played an important part in early Buddhism.  The ''[[stupa]]'' developed as a monument enclosing deposits of relics of the Buddha from plain hemispherical mounds in the 3rd century BCE to elaborate structures such as those at [[Sanchi]] in India and [[Borobudur]] in [[Java]].  Regional variants such as the [[pagoda]] of China and Japan and the [[candi of Indonesia]] evolved from the Indian form.  However, none of these can strictly be called tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Le Phuoc, 140–42; 147–56 on Sanchi; 192–204, especially 196, on ''candi'' in Indonesia, and Borodudur (196–204)&lt;/ref&gt; Some important [[Tibet]]an [[lama]]s are buried in relatively small ''chortens'' (Tibetan stupas), sometimes of precious metal, inside or outside monasteries, sometimes after mummification. There are examples at [[Kursha Monastery]] in [[Zanskar]] and [[Tashiding Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], as well as the [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]] and many other monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Dowman, 54–55 for the Potala, and see index for other locations.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, most chortens do not function as tombs.

=== Christianity ===
[[File:1054 - Roma, Museo d. civiltà Romana - Calco sarcofago Giunio Basso - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 12-Apr-2008.jpg|thumb|left|Plaster cast of the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]]]]
The [[Catacombs of Rome]] contain most of the surviving [[Christian art]] of the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] period, mainly in the form of [[fresco]]s and [[Early Christian sarcophagi|sculpted sarcophagi]]. They show a Christian [[iconography]] emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs.  Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the [[Chi Rho]] monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, Chapter 1; Hall, 77–82&lt;/ref&gt; The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously [[St Peter's, Rome]]) over the burial places of [[martyr]]s who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 39, 72–90&lt;/ref&gt; The beliefs of many cultures, including [[Tumah|Judaism]] and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead [[Ritual purification|ritually impure]] and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture).&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, 48–49. An exception in the Classical World were the [[Lycia]]ns of [[Anatolia]]. There are also the Egyptian mortuary-temples, where the object of worship was the deified royal person entombed, but Egyptian temples to the major gods contained no burials. For an extreme example, see [[Prohibition of death#In antiquity|ancient Delos]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Venezia - Chiesa dei SS. Giovanni e Paolo (S. Zanipolo) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 2 lug 2006 - 08.jpg|thumb|upright|Medieval and Renaissance wall tombs in [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]], including an [[equestrian statue]] at the left]]

Christians believed in a bodily [[resurrection of the dead]] at the [[Second Coming of Christ]], and the Catholic Church only relaxed [[Cremation#Roman Catholicism|its opposition to cremation]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;It was allowed in times of plague however. See [[Cremation in the Christian World]] for more details—the [[Orthodox church]]s still forbid cremation.&lt;/ref&gt; Although mass [[ossuaries]] have also been used, burial has always been the preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a [[crypt]] or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the [[shrine]]s of saints, which became the destinations of [[pilgrimage]]s. The monument to [[Maximilian&amp;nbsp;I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in the [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck]] took decades to complete,&lt;ref&gt;Board of Trustees for The Hofkirche in Innsbruck.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Arca di San Domenico|tomb of Saint Dominic]] in [[Bologna]] took several centuries to reach its final form.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

If only because its strong prejudice against free-standing and life-size sculpture, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] could not have developed the tomb monument in the same way as the Western Church, and the burials of rich or important individuals continued the classical tradition of sarcophagi carved in relief, with the richness of the carving tending to diminish over the centuries, until just simple religious symbols were left.  [[Constantine&amp;nbsp;I]] and most later [[Byzantine Emperor]]s up to 1028 were buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople, which was destroyed after the [[fall of Constantinople]] of 1453.  Some massive but mostly plain [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] sarcophagi from the church are now placed outside the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;Downey.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII]] in [[Florence]] is a grand [[Early Renaissance]] wall tomb by [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]]; although classical in style, it reflects the somewhat inharmonious stacking up of different elements typical of major Gothic tombs.  It has a life-size effigy, also known as a [[gisant]], lying on the sarcophagus, which was common from the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period through to the [[Baroque]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Levey 1967, 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruling dynasties were often buried together, usually in monasteries; the [[Chartreuse de Champmol]] was founded for that purpose by the [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]] in 1383.  The [[Scaliger tombs]] in [[Verona]] are magnificent free-standing [[Gothic art|Gothic]] canopied tombs—they are outside the church in a special enclosure, and so are unrestricted in height.&lt;ref&gt;Though they are exceeded in scale by [[Gothic revival]] monuments like the [[Albert Memorial]] and the [[Scott Monument]], neither containing a tomb.&lt;/ref&gt; Important churches like Saint Peter's in Rome, [[Saint Paul's Cathedral, London]], [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]] (twenty-five [[Doge]]s), and the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]] contain large numbers of impressive monuments to the great and the good, created by the finest architects and sculptors available.  Local [[parish church]]es are also often full of monuments, which may include large and artistically significant ones for local landowners and notables.  Often a prominent family would add a special chapel for their use, including their tombs; in Catholic countries, [[mass bequest|bequests would pay for masses]] to be said in perpetuity for their souls.  By the [[High Renaissance]], led by [[Michelangelo]]'s tombs, the effigies are often sitting up, and later may stand.  Often they turn towards the altar, or are kneeling facing it in profile.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 325&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MULO-Philippe Gueldre Death Mirror.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"The Mirror of Death": Detail from a French [[Renaissance]] monument of 1547|alt=Close-up of a rectangular-shaped carving in stone. In the centre of the rectangle is a circle representing a mirror, and within the circle is a grinning skull. The circle is framed by ram's horns.]]
In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the [[Black Death]] and devotional writers, explicit ''[[memento mori]]'' imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the ''[[transi]]'' tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the [[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]] and works like the ''[[Ars moriendi]]'', or "Art of Dying".&lt;ref&gt;Cohen throughout, see Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;  It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of [[Pope Urban&amp;nbsp;VIII]] by [[Bernini]] (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 324–26&lt;/ref&gt;  As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in [[ossuaries]] where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the [[Capuchin Crypt]] in Rome or the Czech [[Sedlec Ossuary]], which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones.

The church struggled to eliminate the pagan habits of leaving grave goods except for the clothing and usual jewellry of the powerful, especially rings.  Kings might be buried with a [[sceptre]], and bishops with a [[crozier]], their respective symbols of office.&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier and Mane, 112–13&lt;/ref&gt;  The 7th-century [[Stonyhurst Gospel]], with a unique [[Insular art|Insular]] original leather binding, was recovered from [[St Cuthbert's coffin]], itself a significant object; it was probably Cuthbert's personal copy, which he had very likely scribed himself.&lt;ref&gt;Bloxham, Jim and Rose, Krisine; [http://www.gbwny.org/news/2007/11/st-cuthbert-gospel-of-st-john-formerly-known-as-the-stonyhurst-gospel/ ''St. Cuthbert Gospel of St. John, Formerly Known as the Stonyhurst Gospel''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726074901/http://www.gbwny.org/news/2007/11/st-cuthbert-gospel-of-st-john-formerly-known-as-the-stonyhurst-gospel/ |date=26 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The armour and sword of a knight might be hung over his tomb, as those of [[Edward the Black Prince|the Black Prince]] still are in [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The Early Christian Church, to the frustration of historians of costume, encouraged burial in a plain white [[winding-sheet]], as being all that would be required at the Second Coming.  For centuries, most except royalty followed this custom, which at least kept clothing, which was very expensive for rich and poor alike, available for the use of the living.  The use of a rich cloth [[Pall (funeral)|pall]] to cover the coffin during the funeral grew during the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only later black.  They were usually then given to the Church to use for [[vestment]]s or other decorations.&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier and Mane, 34–35; 112–13&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 13th century to the 16th, a popular form of monument north of the Alps, especially for the smaller landowner and merchant classes, was the [[monumental brass]], a sheet of brass on which the image of the person or persons commemorated was engraved, often with inscriptions and an architectural surround.  They could be on the floor or wall inside a church. These provide valuable evidence as to changes in costume, especially for women.  Many bishops and even some German rulers were commemorated with brasses.&lt;ref&gt;"Brasses, Monumental"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompe funebre for Katarzyna Opalińska.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Castrum doloris]]'' for Queen [[Katarzyna Opalińska]] of Poland, erected in [[Notre Dame de Paris]] in 1747]]
The ''[[castrum doloris]]'' was a temporary [[catafalque]] erected around the coffin for the [[lying in state]] of important people, usually in a church, the funerary version of the elaborate temporary decorations for other court festivities, like [[royal entries]].  These began in the late Middle Ages, but reached their height of elaboration in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;The corpse was in fact not always present. Bagliani, 158–59&lt;/ref&gt; A particular feature in Poland was the [[coffin portrait]], a bust-length painted portrait of the deceased, attached to the coffin, but removed before burial and often then hung in the church.  Elsewhere, death masks were used in similar fashion. [[Funerary hatchment|Hatchment]]s were a special lozenge-shaped painted [[coat of arms]] which was displayed on the house of the deceased for a mourning period, before usually being moved to hang in the church.  Like [[mourning|mourning clothes]], these fall outside a strict definition of art.&lt;ref&gt;Piponnier and Mane, 113 for the origins of mourning clothes.&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time after the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[English church monuments]] formed the majority of large-scale artworks added to Protestant churches, especially in sculpture.  The English upper classes ceased to commission altarpieces and other religious art for churches, but their tomb monuments continued to grow in size to fill the empty wall spaces; similar trends were seen in [[Lutheran]] countries, but [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] tended to be more disapproving of figure sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Michalski, xi. Here Michalski refers to this rejection of religious imagery within Calvinism as "iconophobia". See also Gäbler, 72, 76–77 and Potter, 130–31 regarding the religious disputations in Zürich (1523) concerning (among other things) the removal of statues of saints and other icons. Participants included [[Leo Jud]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many portraits were painted after death, and sometimes dead family members were included along with the living; a variety of indications might be used to suggest the distinction.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=3821 ''Saltonstall Family''] is a well-known example. The [[Arnolfini Portrait]] has been claimed to be such a work&lt;/ref&gt;

The large [[Baroque]] tomb monument continued likely to include a portrait of the deceased, and was more likely to include personified figures of Death, Time, Virtues or other figures than angels.  The late medieval [[transi]] tomb vocabulary of images of bodily decay, such as skulls and skeletons, was sometimes re-introduced, but in a less confrontational manner.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 324–27&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neo-Classicism]], led by [[Antonio Canova]], revived the classical ''stela'', either with a portrait or a personification; in this style there was little or no difference between the demands of Catholic and Protestant patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 347–49; Berresford, 36–38&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, many [[Old World]] churchyards and church walls had completely run out of room for new monuments, and cemeteries on the outskirts of cities, towns or villages became the usual place for burials.&lt;ref&gt;"Cemetery"&lt;/ref&gt;  The rich developed the classical styles of the ancient world for small family tombs, while the rest continued to use gravestones or what were now usually false sarcophagi, placed over a buried coffin.  The cemeteries of the large Italian cities are generally accepted to have outdone those of other nations in terms of extravagant statuary, especially the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]] in [[Genoa]], the [[Cimitero Monumentale di Milano]] and the [[Certosa di Bologna]].&lt;ref&gt;Berresford, throughout, and Prefaces&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italy at least, funerary sculpture remained of equal status to other types during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was made by the leading artists, often receiving reviews in the press, and being exhibited, perhaps in [[maquette]] form.&lt;ref&gt;Berresford, 13, and 58 on exhibitions&lt;/ref&gt;  Monuments kept up with contemporary stylistic developments during the 19th century, embracing [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] enthusiastically, but then gradually became detached from the [[avant-garde]] after [[Art Nouveau]] and a few [[Art Deco]] examples.&lt;ref&gt;Berresford, 77–78 on "Liberty" (Italian term for "Art Nouveau") and 99–104 on Art Deco.&lt;/ref&gt;  Where burials in church crypts or floors took place, memorial [[stained glass]] windows, mostly on normal religious subjects but with a commemorative panel, are often found.  [[War memorial]]s, other than on the site of a battle, were relatively unusual until the 19th century, but became increasingly common during it, and after [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] were erected even in villages of the main combatant nations.&lt;ref&gt;Mosse, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===
Islamic funerary art is dominated by architecture.  Grave goods are discouraged to the point that their absence is frequently one recognition criterion of Muslim burials.&lt;ref&gt;Insoll, 172&lt;/ref&gt; Royalty and important religious figures were typically buried in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a religious inscription.  However, funerary architecture often offered a means of "moving beyond the strictures of formal Muslim burial rites" and expressing social dimensions such as status, piety, love for the deceased, and Muslim identity.&lt;ref&gt;Insoll, 177–80&lt;/ref&gt; A number of distinct architectural traditions arose for expressing these social elements.  The Islamic tradition was slow in starting; the ''[[hadith]]'' "condemn the building of tombs, and [[Muhammad]] himself set the example of requesting burial in an unmarked grave in one of the chambers of his house" in [[Medina]],&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, 103&lt;/ref&gt; though by at least the 12th century, buildings of the vast [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] complex already marked the site.  The earliest identified Muslim monumental tomb, in [[Samarra]] in Iraq, only dates from 862, and was commissioned by the Byzantine princess whose son was buried there.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;  At some point, the tradition incorporated the idea of a garden setting, perhaps following the Islamic concept of [[Paradise]], an association certainly made when the tradition was mature, although the difficulty of reconstructing gardens from archaeology makes the early stages of this process hard to trace.  At any rate, gardens surrounding tombs became established in Islamic tradition in many parts of the world, and existing pleasure gardens were sometimes appropriated for this purpose.  Versions of the formal Persian ''[[charbagh]]'' design were widely used in India, Persia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence may have been the octagonal [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], not a mausoleum itself, but "the earliest Islamic model for centrally planned commemorative buildings", adapting the Byzantine form of the martyrium in a building standing alone, though on a stone platform rather than in a garden.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Persianate society|Persian sphere]], a tradition of relatively small mausoleums evolved, often in the shape of short hexagonal or octagonal [[dome]]d towers, usually containing a single chamber, like the [[Malek Tomb]].  These single-chambered tombs developed into larger buildings in the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires,&lt;ref name="Insoll, 177"&gt;Insoll, 177&lt;/ref&gt; like the [[Gur-e Amir]] tomb of [[Timur]] at [[Samarkand]] and the famous Mughal tombs of India, which culminated in the [[Taj Mahal]]. The Mughal tombs are mostly set in a large walled ''charbagh'' (''chahar-bagh'') or [[Mughal gardens]], often with [[pavilion]]s at the corners&lt;ref name="Insoll, 177"/&gt; and a gatehouse. The Taj Mahal is atypically placed at the end of the garden, backing onto the river [[Yamuna]]; a central placing is usual.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, 112 and 122. Her Chapter 10 includes a detailed description of the Taj with special reference to its gardens.&lt;/ref&gt;  They may have [[minaret]]s, although they do not normally function as mosques.  The [[Tomb of Jahangir]] lacks any dome,&lt;ref&gt;An interesting contrast with the Taj Mahal, given they were both built by [[Shah Jahan]].&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Tomb of Akbar the Great]] has only small decorative ones.  Other Islamic Indian rulers built similar tombs, such as [[Gol Gumbaz]].

In all this tradition, the contemporary architectural style for mosques was adapted for a building with a smaller main room, and usually no courtyard.  Decoration was often tilework, and could include ''[[pietra dura|parchin kari]]'' inlays in semi-precious stone, painting, and decorative carving.  No animals would be represented, but geometric patterns and written inscriptions were common.  The sarcophagus might be in a small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room.  Money would be bequeathed to pay for continuous readings of the [[Qur'an]] in the mausoleum, and they were normally open for visitors to pay their respects. The [[Mausoleum of Khomeini]], still under construction in a [[Tehran]] cemetery, and intended to be the centre of a huge complex, continues these traditions.&lt;ref name="NYT K"&gt;The New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/08/world/khomeini-s-tomb-attracts-pilgrims.html ''Khomeini's Tomb Attracts Pilgrims''], Philip Shenon, Published: 8 July 1990, accessed 25 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition evolved differently in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] world, where smaller single-roomed ''[[türbe]]'' typically stand on the grounds of mosque complexes, often built by the deceased.  The sarcophagi (often purely symbolic, as the body is below the floor) may be draped in a rich pall, and surmounted by a real cloth or stone [[turban]], which is also traditional at the top of ordinary [[Turkish people|Turkish]] gravestones (usually in stylised form). Two of the most famous are in the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]]; the [[Yeşil Türbe]] ("Green Tomb") of 1421 is an unusually large example in [[Bursa]], and also unusual in having extensive tile work on the exterior, which is usually masonry, whereas the interiors are often decorated with brightly colored tiles.&lt;ref&gt;Levey 1975, 29–33 on Bursa, 83–84 on Istanbul; all the leading Ottoman tombs are covered in the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parts of the Islamic world reflected local techniques and traditions.  The 15th-century royal [[Tomb of Askia]] in [[Mali]] used the local technique of mud-building to erect a 17 metre high pyramidal tomb set in a mosque complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1139 Tomb of Askia], [[UNESCO]] page with aerial view.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the other end of the Islamic world, [[Java]]nese royalty are mostly buried in royal graveyards such as those at [[Kota Gede]] and [[Imogiri]].

In the Arab world, mausoleums of rulers are more likely to be a side-room inside a mosque or form part of a larger complex containing perhaps a hospital, ''[[madrasah]]'' or library. Large domes, elaborately decorated inside, are common.  The tomb-mosque of Sultan [[Qaitbay]] (died 1496) is a famous example, one of many in [[Cairo]], though here the tomb chamber is unusually large compared to the whole.&lt;ref&gt;See Fletcher and Cruickshank, 596. The [[madrassa]] is labeled "the ultimate achievement of architectural development in Cairo" and its tomb chamber described as "immense."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern period==
[[File:Rachel whitereadwien holocaust mahnmal wien judenplatz.jpg|thumb|The [[Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial]] to the 65,000 Austrian Jews killed in the [[Holocaust]], designed by [[Rachel Whiteread]] and completed in 2000]]
Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect [[modernism]] or other recent styles.  Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially [[war memorials]], and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], and several [[Holocaust memorials]], such as [[Yad Vashem]] in Jerusalem, the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup#Memorials and monuments – Paris|Vel d'Hiv Memorial]] in Paris (1994), the [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]] in Berlin (2004), and the [[Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial]] in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War&amp;nbsp;I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Mosse, 103–106 on conservatism, and generally throughout Chapter 5 on war memorials.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated [[Neue Wache]] in Berlin &lt;ref&gt;Mosse, 97–98; Carrier, 201&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] in Tokyo, which is [[Controversies surrounding Yasukuni Shrine|internationally controversial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1399087/japan-wants-talks-china-korea-yasukuni-shrine "Japan wants talks with China, Korea on Yasukuni Shrine"], [[Associated Press]] story, [[South China Morning Post]] website, 6 January 2014, accessed 4 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to [[genocide]], at least on the Western side of the [[Iron Curtain]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, 19–22; Benton throughout, especially p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eastern Bloc|Communist East]] the established style of [[Socialist Realism]] was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Benton throughout, especially Chapter 1 on Soviet War Memorials (pp. 12–13 on Socialist Realism), but also noting deviations in the Warsaw Pact satellites, as on p. 194, and Chapter 7 on West Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; The generation of abstracted and [[Conceptual art|conceptual]] war and [[Holocaust]] memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, throughout, especially Chapter 8.  See also the copious literature on the Washington Vietnam Veterans Memorial.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] and those for [[Anıtkabir|Atatürk]], [[Mazar-e-Quaid|Jinnah]], [[Kumsusan Memorial Palace|Kim Il-Sung]], [[Mausoleo Che Guevara|Che Guevara]] and several [[Presidential memorials in the United States]], although the actual burials of recent presidents are very simple, with their [[Presidential library]] and museum now usually their largest commemorative memorial.  The Mausoleum of Khomeini is a grand mosque complex, as large as any medieval example, not least because it includes a 20,000 place parking lot.&lt;ref name="NYT K"/&gt;

The '''Internet Speculative Fiction Database''' ('''ISFDB''') is a database of bibliographic information on genres considered [[speculative fiction]], including [[science fiction]] and related genres such as [[fantasy fiction]] and [[horror fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Link Sites | url=http://www.sfsite.com/depts/sites01.htm | work=SF Site | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=craphound&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Cory Doctorow]] | title=Internet Column from Science Fiction Age | url=http://craphound.com/nonfic/16.html | work=Science Fiction Age |date=September 1998 |quote=The best all-round guide to things science-fictional remains the Internet Speculative Fiction Database. | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISFDB is a volunteer effort, with both the database and [[wiki]] being open for editing and user contributions. The ISFDB database and code are available under [[Creative Commons]] licensing&lt;ref name=isfdb_lic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfdb.org/wiki/index.php/ISFDB:General_disclaimer#Copyright|work=ISFDB Wiki|publisher=ISFDB|title=General disclaimer|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is support within both [[Wikipedia]] and ISFDB for interlinking.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Template:isfdb name]], [[Template:isfdb title]], and [[Template:isfdb series]]. See also the "Wikipedia link" field when editing title or author data at the ISFDB. Documentation at {{cite web |url= http://www.isfdb.org/wiki/index.php/Help:Screen:EditTitle#WikipediaEntry| work=ISFDB Help | title=Help:Screen:EditTitle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data are reused by other organizations, such as [[Freebase (database)|Freebase]], under the creative commons license.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Freebase Blog » Blog Archive » Our latest mass data load: science fiction books|url = http://blog.freebase.com/2009/04/14/science-fiction-books/|date = 2012-05-19|accessdate = 2015-12-12|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120519023333/http://blog.freebase.com/2009/04/14/science-fiction-books/|archivedate = 2012-05-19|quote = ...it is widely considered one of the most authoritative sources about Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror literature available on the Internet.|last = Zenkat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The ISFDB database indexes authors, novels, short stories, publishers, awards, and magazines. Additionally, it supports author pseudonyms, series, awards, and cover art plus interior illustration credits which is combined into integrated author, artist, and publisher bibliographies. An ongoing effort is verification of publication contents and secondary bibliographic sources against the database with the goals being data accuracy and to improve the coverage of [[speculative fiction]] to 100%. The current database statistics are available online.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt; ISFDB was the winner of the 2005 Wooden Rocket Award in the ''Best Directory Site'' category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url         = http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/wooden/wr_2005_winners.php

| quote       = 14 Best Directory Site. Directories, online databases or search engines with a worthy SFF section. Winner: Internet Speculative Fiction Database www.isfdb.org.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ISFDB is primarily a bibliographic research database it also contains biographic data for books, authors, series, and publishers that do not have an article on Wikipedia, particularly those unlikely to have such an article because they do not meet Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:notability|notability]] standards.

In 1998, [[Cory Doctorow]] wrote in ''[[Science Fiction Age]]'': "The best all-round guide to things science-fictional remains the Internet Speculative Fiction Database".&lt;ref name=craphound /&gt; In April 2009, Zenkat wrote on Freebase "...it is widely considered one of the most authoritative sources about Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror literature available on the Internet."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{As of|2009|5}}, [[Quantcast]] estimates that the ISFDB is visited by over 32,000 people monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quantcast.com/isfdb.org | title=Site Statistics | work=Quantcast | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a real-world example of a non-trivial database, the schema and MySQL files from the ISFDB have been used in a number of tutorials. ISFDB schema and data were used throughout Chapter 9 of the book ''Rails For Java Developers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rails For Java Developers | ISBN=0-9776166-9-X | url=http://ericdean.com/music/vc/railsforjava.pdf | accessdate=2011-03-14 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710195438/http://ericdean.com/music/vc/railsforjava.pdf | archivedate=2011-07-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in a series of tutorials by [[Lucid Imagination]] on [[Solr]], an enterprise search platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Solr Powered ISFDB – Part #1 | url=http://www.lucidimagination.com/blog/2011/01/21/solr-powered-isfdb-part1/ | accessdate=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Several speculative fiction author bibliographies were posted to the [[USENET]] [[newsgroup]] rec.arts.sf.written from 1984 to 1994 by [[Jerry Boyajian]], [[Gregory J. E. Rawlins]] and [[John Wenn]]. A more or less standard bibliographic format was developed for these postings.&lt;ref name="onpedia"&gt;{{cite web |title = Internet Speculative Fiction Database|url = http://www.onpedia.com/encyclopedia/Internet-Speculative-Fiction-Database|work = onpedia|accessdate = 2009-05-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120306055809/http://www.onpedia.com/encyclopedia/Internet-Speculative-Fiction-Database|archivedate = 2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these bibliographies can still be found at The Linköping Science Fiction Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Linköping Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Archive | url=http://www.lysator.liu.se/sf_archive/ | accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, a searchable database of awards information was developed by [[Al von Ruff]].&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt; In 1994, [[John R. R. Leavitt]] created the Speculative Fiction Clearing House (SFCH). In late 1994, he asked for help in displaying awards information, and von Ruff offered his database tools. Leavitt declined, because he wanted code that could interact with other aspects of the site. In 1995, Al von Ruff and "Ahasuerus" (a prolific contributor to rec.arts.sf.written) started to construct the ISFDB, based on experience with the SFCH and the bibliographic format finalized by John Wenn. The ISFDB went live in September 1995, and a URL was published in January 1996.&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What's New | url=http://www.isfdb.org/wiki/index.php/What%27s_New |work=ISFDB | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISFDB was first located at an ISP in Champaign Illinois, but it suffered from constrained resources in disk space and database support, which limited its growth.&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt; In October 1997 the ISFDB moved to [[SF Site]], a major SF portal and review site.&lt;ref name=craphound /&gt;&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt; Due to the rising costs of remaining with SF Site, the ISFDB moved to its own domain in December 2002. The site was quickly shut down by the hosting ISP due to high resource usage.&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Literary treasure needs new home | url=http://www.boingboing.net/2003/01/25/literary-treasure-ne.html | author=[[Cory Doctorow]] |work=[[Boing Boing]] | date=January 25, 2003 | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2003, after having been offline since January, the ISFDB began to be hosted by The Cushing Library Science Fiction and Fantasy Research Collection and Institute for Scientific Computation at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref name=onpedia /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ISFDB finds new home at Texas A&amp;M|url = http://archive.sfwa.org/news/isfdbhome.htm|work = SFWA News|publisher = Science Fiction Writers of America|date = April 5, 2003|accessdate = 2010-09-29|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110811172943/http://archive.sfwa.org/news/isfdbhome.htm|archivedate = 2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ISFDB rises from the grave | url=http://www.boingboing.net/2003/03/25/isfdb-rises-from-the.html | author= Cory Doctorow | date=March 25, 2003 |work=[[Boing Boing]] | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, after resource allocation problems with Texas A&amp;M, the ISFDB became independently hosted on a hired server at the URL listed above.

The ISFDB was originally edited by a limited number of people, principally Al von Ruff and "Ahasuerus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Major Contributors | url=http://www.isfdb.org/wiki/index.php/Major_Contributors |work=ISFDB | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2006 editing was opened to the general public on an Open Content basis. Changed content must be approved by one of a limited number of moderators, in an attempt to protect the accuracy of the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Changes to the ISFDB | url=http://other-worlds-cafe.com/news/blog/?m=200612 | work=Science Fiction Brewed Fresh Daily | publisher=Other*Worlds*Cafe | date=December 23, 2006 | author=Gandalara
| accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these fragrances are no longer in production.

==Limited editions==
Beginning in 2005, L'Artisan has issued a limited edition "grand cru" soliflore perfume each year from a specific harvest of a particular flower. The creator of the fragrances is master "nose" [[Anne Flipo]]. Production is limited to a few thousand bottles each. The price is considerably higher ($250–$295 per 3.4 ounce bottle) and the packaging more elaborate than for the regular fragrances. These include:

* Fleur d'Oranger 2005 (Orange blossom harvest of April 2004 from [[Nabeul, Tunisia]])
* Fleur de Narcisse 2006 (Narcissus harvest of June 6–7, 2005 from [[Lozère, France]])
* Iris Pallida 2007 (Tuscan iris harvest of 2001). Iris scent molecules take three years to form in the roots (rhizomes) of the iris plant. These roots are dried, ground into colloidal powder, and treated with alcohol to make orris butter, the precious pure absolute of the ''[[Iris pallida]]'' plant. It takes 41 tons of iris root to produce one kilogram of rhizomal extract.
* Fleur d'Oranger 2007 (Orange blossom harvest of April 2006 from Nabeul, Tunisia)

'''Lance Fung''' is an art [[curator]] who has been responsible for several major exhibitions including "Snow Show" at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Torino, Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/11890/art-at-the-olympics-and-beyond-a-chat-with-lance-fung-the-collaborationist/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/02/garden/02snow.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Fung founded Fung Collaboratives, an inter-disciplinary arts organization. Most recently, Fung transformed vacant lots in [[Atlantic City]] into a park system through his exhibition ''Artlantic''. These “giant living sculptures” attract local residents and visiting art enthusiasts to experience art in “green” settings designed by Fung and the participants Diana Balmori, Robert Barry, Peter Hutchinson, Ilya &amp; Emilia Kabakov, John Roloff, and Kiki Smith.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/05/arts/design/artlantic-weathers-hurricane-in-atlantic-city.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Fung is curating ''Nonuments'' in Washington D.C. for the 5 x 5 project organized by the [[DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities]]. This project will result in five temporary monuments commemorating current issues such as the survivors of human trafficking, global warming, and immigrant conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://dcarts.dc.gov/release/district-will-be-canvas-25-public-art-installations-fall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the5x5project.com/lance-fung/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Recoleta Cemetery - Mausoleums 37.jpg|thumb|Barrel vault]]
[[File:Andrea Pozzo - Apoteose de Santo Inacio cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Trompe l'oeil]] ceiling fresco by [[Andrea Pozzo]]. The ceiling is completely flat, including the [[dome]] on the left/]]

* [[Ambulatory|Ambulatory vault]] – the covered portion of the covered passage around a [[cloister]]. Often written in the context of an ambulatory vault mosaic.
* [[Annular vault]] – A [[Barrel vault]] springing from two concentric walls.
* Aynalı vault – Turkish vault made by cutting a monastery vault's upper part in a horizontal plane. ''See [[Cavetto|Cavetto vault]]''
* [[Barrel vault]] – An architecture tunnel vault or [[barrel vault]] is a semicircular arch extended in depth: a continuous series of arches, one behind the other. The simplest form of an architecture vault, consisting of a continuous surface of semicircular or pointed sections. It resembles a barrel or tunnel which has been cut in half lengthwise and is known as tunnel vault or wagon vault. A longitudinal barrel vault is a barrel (or tunnel) vault which follows the main longitudinal direction of the nave. Usually when a vault is referred to simply as a barrel (or tunnel) vault, it may be assumed to be a longitudinal barrel vault.
* Baroque vault – term from [[Church of Our Lady in front of Týn]]. Also see [[Baroque#Architecture|Baroque architecture]].
* [[Catalan vault]] – The Catalan vault, also called the Catalan turn or Catalan arch, is a type of low arch made of plain bricks. It is traditionally constructed by laying bricks lengthwise, making it a much gentler curve than has generally been produced by other methods of construction.
* [[Cavetto|Cavetto vault]] – Cavetto is a hollow, concave molding sometimes employed in the place of the [[cymatium]] of a [[cornice]], as in that of the [[Doric order]] of the [[theatre of Marcellus]]. It forms the crowning feature of [[Egyptian temple]]s, and took the place of the cymatium in many of the Etruscan temples.

* [[Cross vault]] – ''See [[Groin vault]]''
* Cycloidal vault – A vault in which the diameter across the springline is equal to the circumference of a circle fitting inside the space between the apex of the vault and the diameter line. This particular proportion system creates very little lateral thrust from the vault structure.
* [[Cylindrical vault]] – ''See [[Barrel vault]]''
* [[Diamond vault]] – A diamond vault is a form of vault used in the [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] and [[Renaissance]] style, which is based on an elaborate system of cavernous vaults in a manner resembling diamonds. It was widely used especially in [[Central Europe]]an countries.
* [[Domical vault]] – ''See [[Cloister vault]]''
* [[Fan vault]] – An architecture vault which consists of fan-shaped half cones which usually meet at the center of a vault.
* Gothic vault – From [[Talk:Branch (disambiguation) |Talk page]]. See also [[Gothic architecture#Characteristics|Gothic architecture]] and [[Church of Holy Trinity in Mošovce]], [[Synagogue of Tomar]].
* [[Groin vault]] – An architecture groin vault is formed when two [[barrel vault]]s intersect. The undersurface, or [[soffit]], may be generated from a series of pointed, rather than round, arches. Also known as a cross vault. An architecture vault produced by the intersection at right angles of two barrel (tunnel) vaults. Sometimes the arches of groin vaults may be pointed instead of round.
* [[Handkerchief vault]] – ''See [[Dome]]''

It is named after the star shape generated by connecting liernes. Also see [[Stellar vault]].
* [[Muqarnas|Muqarnas vault]] – Muqarnas is the Arabic word for stalactite vault, an architectural ornament developed around the middle of the tenth century in north-eastern [[Iran]] and almost simultaneously, but apparently independently, in central [[North Africa]]. A muqarnas is a three-dimensional architectural decoration composed of niche-like elements arranged in tiers. The two-dimensional projection of a muqarnas vault consists of a small variety of simple geometrical elements.
* [[Net vault]] – A vault on which a complex of ribs gives a net-like appearance.
* [[Nubian vault]] – A contour that obtained when a chain is held up at its two ends.
* [[Ogee arch|Ogee vault]] – Ogee is a shape consisting of a concave arc flowing into a convex arc, so forming an S-shaped curve with vertical ends.
* [[Ogive#Architecture|Ogival vault]] – An architectural vault
* [[Parabolic vault]] – An architectural vault with a [[Parabola|parabolic]] cross section.
* [[Paraboloid|Hyperbolic paraboloid]] vault.
* [[Ploughshare vault]] – A [[Rib vault]] where the wall ribs spring from a higher position than those of the diagonal ribs.
* [[Quadripartite vault]] – A [[Rib vault]] where the bay is divided by diagonal and transverse ribs into four cells or webs.
* [[Rampant vault]] – A [[Barrel vault]] where one springing in point is higher than the opposite springing point.
* [[Rear vault]] – A &lt;!-- a what? --&gt; of the internal hood of a doorway or window to which a splay has been given on the reveal, sometimes the vaulting surface is terminated by a small rib known as the scoinson rib, and a further development is given by angle shafts carrying this rib, known as scoinson shafts.
* [[Rib vault]] – A rib vault is any vault reinforced by masonry ribs. Also known as a ribbed vault. A rib vault may be a quadripartite rib vault (which is divided into four sections by two diagonal ribs) and a [[Sexpartite vault|sexpartite rib vault]] (a rib vault whose surface is divided into six sections by three ribs).
* [[Sail vault]] – ''See [[Dome]]''
* [[Sexpartite vault]] – A [[Rib vault]] similar to the [[Quadripartite vault]], but where the bay is further divided by an extra transverse ribs so that there are six cells.
* [[Shell vault]] – A thin self-supporting vault.
* Stalactite vault – See [[Muqarnas|Muqarnas vault]]. A vaulting system employing carved [[Muqarna]] to corbel the span.

U.S.-patented (1885) system using interlocking [[terracotta]] [[tile]]s and layers of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in a thin skin, with the tiles following the curve of the roof as opposed to horizontal ([[corbel]]ling), or perpendicular to the curve (Roman). This is known as ''timbrel'' vaulting because of supposed likeness to the skin of a [[timbrel]] or [[tambourine]].
* Tierceron vault – A vault consisting of unnecessary ribs all transverse in nature, often confused with a [[Fan vault]] from a conceived imagery standpoint, often intersecting a ridge rib.
* Tripartite vault – The resulting intersection, triangular on plan, of 3 vaults.
* [[Tunnel vault]] – ''See [[Barrel vault]]''
* [[Vault grid]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4471596.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comics in wrestling==
*"Arachnaman" (portrayed by [[Brad Armstrong (wrestler)|Brad Armstrong]]) appeared in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in the early 1990s wearing a costume resembling that of [[Spider-Man]]'s aside from its yellow coloration instead of red. His gimmick included shooting 'webs' upon his ring entrance.
*[[Steve Borden|Sting]] changed from a colorful flamboyant performer to a dark brooding figure after being falsely accused of betrayal in the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] storyline in late 1996. As a result, he adopted a black and white look and brooded in the rafters of the arenas, mimicking ''[[The Crow]]'' by [[James O'Barr]] in appearance to the point of actual birds appearing as well. [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]] suggested the idea to Sting, knowing of the concept but not having seen or read any of the materials himself.
*[[Tiger Mask]] was originally a popular Japanese [[manga]] character; as a result, [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) decided to capitalize on this by employing the young [[Satoru Sayama]] to play the character as an actual wrestler. The resultant success led to the character being reassigned, following Sayama's retirement, to other wrestlers, namely the now high-profile [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] and [[Koji Kanemoto]]. The current incarnation is the fourth, played by [[Tiger Mask IV|Yoshihiro Yamazaki]].
*[[Gangrel (Old World of Darkness)|Gangrel]] was a [[vampire]] character from the White Wolf brand of comics and role-playing games. [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) employed a wrestler previously known as the [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Vampire Warrior]] (real name: David Heath) to play the character, as the leader of a cult-like faction called [[The Brood]], which also consisted of the wrestlers [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] and [[Jason Reso|Christian]].
*[[Gregory Helms]] wrestles as The Hurricane, a superhero gimmick with elements of [[Green Lantern|The Green Lantern]].

==Other connections==
*[[Rob Van Dam]] is an avid collector, who cites [[Ghost Rider]] as his favorite character, and operates his own store, ''RVD's Five Star Comics'', in California, and plans to write his own series.
*[[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] wrote an issue of ''Spider-Man: Tangled Web'' for Marvel Comics. The issue featured a partial rewrite of Spider-Man's history, and focused on Crusher Hogan, the wrestler whom Spider-Man first tested his powers on.
*[[CM Punk]] has also been hired as a writer for Marvel Comics.

The '''Margravial Opera House''' ({{lang-de|Markgräfliches Opernhaus}}) is a [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] [[opera house]] in the town of [[Bayreuth]], [[Germany]], built between 1744 and 1748. It is one of Europe's few surviving theatres of the period and has been extensively restored.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmann, A. J., 
''[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/arts/music/bayreuth-margravial-opera-house.html?emc=edit_th_180417&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=686341800417 Inch by Inch, an Operatic Jewel Is Polished]'', The New York Times, April 16, 2018, photographs by Gordon Welters&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2012, the opera house was inscribed in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1379| publisher=UNESCO| title=Margravial Opera House Bayreuth| accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was built according to plans designed by the [[Kingdom of France|French]] architect {{Interlanguage link multi|Joseph Saint-Pierre|de}} (ca. 1709 – 1754), court builder of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] margrave [[Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Frederick of Brandenburg-Bayreuth]] and his wife Princess [[Wilhelmine of Prussia, Margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Wilhelmine of Prussia]]. It was inaugurated on the occasion of the marriage of their daughter [[Margravine Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie]] with Duke [[Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg|Charles Eugene of Württemberg]].

[[File:Opéra des margraves intérieur Bayreuth.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|none|Interior]]

The wooden interior was designed by [[Giuseppe Galli Bibiena]] (1696 – 1757)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldheritagesite.org/list/Margravial+Opera+House|title=Margravial Opera House Bayreuth - World Heritage Site - Pictures, info and travel reports|website=www.worldheritagesite.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son Carlo from [[Bologna]] in an [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italian]] Late Baroque style. The [[Box (theatre)|box]] theatre is completely preserved in its original condition, except for the curtain which was taken by [[Napoleon]]'s troops on their march to the 1812 [[French invasion of Russia|Russian campaign]]. The prince box was seldom used by the art-minded margravial couple, who preferred a front-row seat.

Princess Wilhelmine, older sister of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king [[Frederick the Great]], had established the margravial theatre company in 1737. In the new opera house she participated as a composer of [[opera]] works and ''[[Singspiel]]e'', as well as an actor and director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sfopera.com/contentassets/8bab3d29ee2c4743b96f5621c7972be3/article---kotnik.pdf|title=The Adaptability of Opera: When Different Social Agents Come to Common Ground|last=Kotnik|first=Vlado|date=6 July 2017|website=sfopera.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today she features in a sound-and-light presentation for tourists. After her death in 1758, performances ceased and the building went into disuse, one reason for its good conservation status.

More than one hundred years later, the stage's great depth of {{convert|27|m|ft}}&lt;ref name=City&gt;{{cite web| title=UNESCO-Weltkulturerbe Markgräfliches Opernhaus|trans-title=UNESCO World Heritage Site: Margravial Opera House| url=http://www.bayreuth.de/tourismus-kultur-freizeit/sehen-und-erleben/unesco-weltkultur-und-markgraefin-wilhelmine/markgraefliches-opernhaus/| publisher=City of Bayreuth: Tourism, Culture and Leisure| language=German| accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; attracted the composer [[Richard Wagner]], who in 1872 chose Bayreuth as festival centre and had the ''[[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Festspielhaus]]'' built north of the town. The foundation stone ceremony was held on 22 May, Wagner's birthday, and included a performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]], directed by the maestro.  

Parts of the 1994 biopic ''[[Farinelli (film)|Farinelli]]'' were filmed in the Opera House. The theatre was the site of the annual [[Bayreuther Osterfestival]] until 2009. Each September from the year 2000 to 2009, the theatre also hosted the Bayreuth Baroque festival, with performances of early operatic rarities. The 2009 festival included performances of [[Andrea Bernasconi]]'s ''festa teatrale'', ''L'Huomo'', to a libretto by the [[Princess Wilhelmine of Prussia| Margravine Wilhelmine]].

The theatre closed between October 2012 for extensive refurbishment and redevelopment and reopened April 12, 2018.&lt;ref name=City/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article175442510/Bayreuth-hat-mit-dem-Markgraeflichen-Opernhaus-seinen-schoensten-Kulturtempel-zurueck.html|title=Bayreuth hat seinen schönsten Kulturtempel zurück|last=Brug|first=Manuel|date=2018-04-14|website=Die Welt|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/de/markgr%C3%A4fliches-opernhaus-bayreuth-in-neuem-glanz-wiederer%C3%B6ffnet/a-43346264|title=Markgräfliches Opernhaus Bayreuth in neuem Glanz wiedereröffnet|last=|first=|date=2018-04-12|website=Deutsche Welle|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portrait of Émile Zola''''' is a painting of [[Émile Zola]] by [[Édouard Manet]]. Manet submitted the portrait to the 1868 Salon.
[[Image:Edouard Manet 049.jpg|thumb|right|220px]]

At this time Zola was known for his art criticism, and perhaps particularly as the writer of the novel [[Thérèse Raquin]].  This told the story of an adulterous affair between Thérèse, the wife of a clerk in a railway company, and a would-be painter named Laurent, whose work, rather like that of Zola's friend [[Paul Cézanne]], is denigrated by the critics.&lt;ref&gt;Ross King, ''The Judgment of Paris'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eleventh chapter the milieu of Manet's [[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe]] is evoked, in the murder scene, where Camille, the husband, goes out for the day with his wife and her lover to [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]].

On the wall is a reproduction of Manet's ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'', a controversial painting at the 1865 Salon but which Zola considered Manet's best work. "Behind it is an engraving from [[Diego Velázquez|Velazquez]]'s ''Bacchus'' indicating the taste for Spanish art shared by the painter and the writer. A Japanese print of a wrestler by [[Utagawa school|Utagawa Kuniaki II]] completes the décor."  A Japanese screen on the left of the picture recalls the role that the Far East played in revolutionizing ideas on perspective and colour in European painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/painting/commentaire_id/emile-zola-3060.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=509&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=841&amp;cHash=97ca12b598 musee-orsay]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raghurajpur''' is a heritage crafts village out of  [[Puri district]], [[India]], known for its master [[Pattachitra]] painters, an art form which dates back to 5&amp;nbsp;BC in the region and [[Gotipua]] dance troupes, the precursor to the [[Indian classical dance]] form of [[Odissi dance|Odissi]]. It is also known as the birthplace of one of the finest Odissi exponents and Guru, [[Kelucharan Mohapatra]]. Apart from that, the village is also home to crafts like Tussar paintings, palm leaf engravings, stone and wood carvings, wooden, cowdung and papier mache toys, and masks.&lt;ref name=bi&gt;[[#Bo|Bindloss, p. 648]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fr&gt;{{cite news |title=A visitors' delight  |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1924/stories/20021206002208600.htm |publisher=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]] |date=Volume 19 - Issue 24, 23 November – 6 December 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bu, Bundgaard. p. 65]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, after a two-year research and documentation project by [[INTACH]], starting 1998, the village was chosen to be developed as state's first heritage village and developed as a Crafts village, soon the village had an interpretation centre, commissioned artwork on the walls of the artists’ homes and a rest house.&lt;ref name=fr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HERITAGE: Mural village|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2516/stories/20080815251607400.htm |publisher=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]] |date=Volume 25 - Issue 16 :: 2–15 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also has the distinction of the only place where the traditional decoration called ''Patas'', used under the throne of Lord [[Jagannath]] and on the three chariots during the annual [[Rath Yatra]] festival, that takes place at pilgrimage town of [[Puri]], some 14&amp;nbsp;km away, known for the [[Jagannath Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pattachitra.com/raghurajpur.htm Rajhurajpur - pattachitra]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Behind-the-scene action before the Rath Yatra|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/behindthescene-action-before-the-rath-yatra/44947-3.html|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|date=15 Jul 2007|access-date=27 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006222043/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/behindthescene-action-before-the-rath-yatra/44947-3.html#|archive-date=6 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated amidst groves of coconut, palm, mango and jack fruit, the main village has two streets with over 120 houses, most decorated with mural paintings, where the painters reside and practice their pattachitra craft, besides many other that practices throughout the village, including traditional masks, stone idols, papier mache, sculptures, wooden toys.&lt;ref name=bi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsofindia.com/puri/weekend-tours/raghurajpur.html Rajhurajpur] mapsofindia.&lt;/ref&gt; The village also has a series of temples dedicated not only to Bhuasuni, the local deity but also to various [[Hindu]] gods including, Radha Mohan, Gopinath, Raghunath, [[Laxminarayan]] and [[Gouranga]].

Around, 2000 it was developed as a heritage village by [[INTACH]], and soon became a major rural tourist destination of the state, drawing tourist, both domestic and foreign to the village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/11/stories/2007101157960200.htm INTACH to develop village in Ganjam district] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Villagers were also trained to provide heritage walks to the visitors by the organisation, and has since become a template for heritage tourism in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/culture/AAHM/heritage_guides_training/training_kit/Core_module/English_version.pdf Heritage Guide training] [[UNESCO]], [[Bangkok]].Feb, 2007.

The [[pattachitra]] paintings are made over a piece of cloth known as ''Patta'' or a dried palm leaf, which is first painted with a mixture of chalk and gum. Over the prepared surface, colorful and intricate pictures of various Gods, Goddesses, and mythological scenes with ornamentation of flowers, trees and animals are then painted. The paintings on Tussar saris, especially the [[Sambalpuri Saree]] depicting Mathura Vijay, Raslila and Ayodhya Vijay owe their origin to ‘Raghurajpur [[Pattachitra]] paintings’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Where every villager is an artist|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020414/spectrum/main7.htm |publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] |date=14 April 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
It is situated 14&amp;nbsp;km away from Hindu pilgrimage town of [[Puri]], on the southern banks of river Bhargabi (Bhargavi). Visitors from Puri take the [[Bhubaneswar]] road, near Chandanpur, on NH-316, and upon reaching the Chandanpur Bazaar, they can take a right turn to reach Raghurajpur. The village is then around 1.5&amp;nbsp;km from Chandanpur.&lt;ref name=bi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/9354769/Raghurajpur Raghurajpur] [[wikimapia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:San Pedro de Larrede.jpg|thumb|The church of [[San Pedro de Lárrede]] is an example of ''Repoblación'' architecture closely linked to Asturian architecture and distinct from Mozarabic.&lt;ref name=Rutas/&gt;]]
The designation ''arte'' (or ''arquitectura'') ''de'' (''la'') ''repoblación'' (literally, "art or architecture of [the] repopulation") was first proposed by [[:es:José Camón Aznar|José Camón Aznar]] in 1949&lt;ref&gt;Although presented in a conference in 1949, it was not published and widely read until 1963. Cf. Utrero Agudo (2006), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; to replace the term [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] as applied to certain works of [[architecture]] from the Christian kingdoms of northern Spain between the end of the 9th and beginning of the 11th centuries. Camón argued that these buildings were related stylistically to the [[Asturian architecture|architecture of Asturias]] and owed little to [[Moorish architecture|Andalusian styles]]. Moreover, since they were built by Christians living under Christian rule, neither were they Mozarabic (the [[Mozarabs]] being the Christians of Muslim Spain).&lt;ref name=Rutas&gt;Canellas López and San Vicente (1996), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spanish historiography, the ''[[repoblación]]'' is the expansion of Christian settlement in the [[Duero]] basin and the [[Meseta Central]] in the 9th–10th centuries.

==History==
The religious influences were inevitable given the presence of the  Islamic state of the [[Caliph of Córdoba]], which was highly developed culturally, artistically and economically. However, it had long been suggested that the monumental buildings in northern Spain from this period were crafted by the modest groups of Mozarabic immigrants that settled in the areas of repopulation when the living conditions in Muslim [[al-Andalus]] became difficult to bear. As stated by professor Isidro Bango Torviso, suggesting that these immigrants were responsible for these buildings would be akin to suggesting that:
{{quote|when the Duero River Valley was repopulated under the auspices of the Asturian-[[Kingdom of León|Leonese]] kingdom, northerners settlers would have forsaken all their knowledge and experience and submitted themselves to the 'very rich and demonstrated creative capacity' of poor, rural southern immigrants.}}

The Art and Architecture of the Repoblación is identified as the third subset of the ''Hispanic'' [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]] period, by the phases that correspond to the [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]] and [[Asturian architecture|Asturian art]]. Its architecture is a summary of elements of diverse extraction, irregularly distributed, in such a way that on occasion elements of paleo-Christian, Visigothic or Asturian origin come to predominate, while at other times Muslim characteristics come to the fore.

==Characteristics==
{{list to prose|date=January 2018}}
Some of the identifying characteristics of this Repoblación ecclesiastic architectural style are:
* Basilica or centralized plan; sometimes with opposing [[apse]]s.
* Main chapel on a rectangular plan on the exterior and ultra-semicircular in the interior.
* Use of the [[horseshoe arch]] of Muslim derivation, somewhat more closed and sloped than the Visigothic.
* Generalized use of the horseshoe arch doorway or ''alfiz''.
* Use of the twin and triple windows of Asturian tradition.
* Roofs composed of segmented [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], including traditional [[barrel vault]]s.
* Grouped [[column]]s forming composite pillars, with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian capitals]] decorated with stylized elements and cinctures joining the capital to the columns.
* Walls re-enforced by exterior buttresses.
* Evolution of rafter ornaments to great lobed offsets that support very pronounced eaves.
* Decoration similar to the Visigothic based on volutes, [[swastika]]s, and vegetable and animal themes forming projecting borders.
* A great command of the technique in construction, employing principally ashlar by ''[[bond (masonry)|length and width]]''.
* Absence or sobriety of exterior decoration.
* Diversity in the floor plans, with small proportions and discontinuous spaces covered by [[cupolas]] (groined, segmented, ribbed of horseshoe transept, etc.).

==Examples==
The most representative buildings of the genre are:{{fact|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3912">'''Riko Mizuno''' (born 1932) is a Los Angeles gallerist, art dealer, and artist. Born in Tokyo, Japan, she moved to Los Angeles in the 1950s to study ceramics at [[Chouinard Art Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riko Mizuno, gallerist|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/people/riko-mizuno/|website=Pacific Standard Time at the Getty Center|publisher=Getty Research Institute|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1966 and 1984, Mizuno operated galleries at several locations in Los Angeles.

Los Angeles artist [[Vija Celmins]] characterized Mizuno's contribution to the Los Angeles art world in a 1993 interview with Susan Morgan of the ''Los Angeles Times'': "Riko Mizuno was very important to artists in Los Angeles. She created an incredibly nurturing atmosphere. We would sit around her kitchen, drinking sake, eating her delicious food, and always talking, talking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=Susan|title=The Beauty of a Long Attention Span Speed...|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=December 12, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mizuno Gallery==
In 1966, Mizuno opened Gallery 669 on La Cienega Boulevard. She collaborated briefly at 669 with [[Eugenia Butler, Sr.|Eugenia Butler]]. In 1969 she re-opened the gallery as Mizuno Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mizuno Gallery|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/locations/mizuno-gallery/|website=Pacific Standard Time at the Getty|publisher=Getty Research Institute|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mizuno Gallery operated until 1984 at three locations: on La Cienega Boulevard, in Little Tokyo, and on N.

In a 1973 article about [[Chris Burden]], [[Peter Plagens]] referred to Mizuno's gallery, where Burden had recently performed ''Dead Man'', as a "young artist showplace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plagens|first1=Peter|title=He Got Shot--For His Art|journal=The New York Times|date=September 2, 1973|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/09/02/90474313.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33847">'''Sailors' superstitions''' have been [[superstition]]s particular to [[sailor]]s or mariners, and which traditionally have been common around the world.  Some of these beliefs are popular superstitions, while others are actually better described as traditions, stories, folklore, tropes, myths, or legend.

The origins of many of these superstitions are based in the inherent risks of [[sailing]], and [[luck]], either good or bad, as well as [[portents]] and [[omens]] that would be given associative meaning in relation to the life of a mariner, sailor, fisherman or a crew in general. Even into the 21st century, "fishers and related fishing workers" still have amongst the most dangerous jobs, with the second highest rate of mortality only after [[lumberjack|loggers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4326676/dangerous-jobs-america/|work=[[''Time'' (magazine)|''Time'']]|title=The Most Dangerous Jobs in America|first=David|last=Johnson|date=May 13, 2016|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bad luck==
{{see also|Evil eye}}
By far the best known sailors' superstitions involve bad luck.

===Red Sunrise===
Sailors are taught if the sunrise is red to take warning. The day ahead will be dangerous.

"Red Sky at night, Sailors delight; Red Sky in the morning, Sailors take warning."

===Jonah===
A "[[Jonah]]" is a long-established expression among sailors, meaning a person (either a sailor or a passenger) who is bad luck, which is based on the Biblical prophet Jonah.  The [[Jonah (comics)|comic character Jonah's]] name is a direct reference to the long established sailor's superstition.
This concept is prominent in the film ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]''.

===Unlucky days===
[[Friday]] is considered to be an unlucky day in some cultures, and perhaps the most enduring sailing superstition is that it is unlucky to begin a voyage or 'set sail' on a Friday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Sailors are often reluctant to set sail on [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple#Traditions and superstitions|Candlemas Day]], believing that any voyage begun then will end in disaster.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} This may be related to the superstition to remove all Christmas decorations by Candlemas, a practice done well into Victorian times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/xmas/twelfth.htm|title=Twelfth Night and Decorations|date=|accessdate=June 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412075648/http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/xmas/twelfth.htm#|archive-date=2016-04-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 18th century New England, rolling clouds and roaring waves were thought as bad omens, so sailing on days under such conditions was considered inadvisable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=McCullough|page=178|title=[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]|place=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2001|isbn=0-684-81363-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sirens and Scylla===
[[File:Odysseus Sirens BM E440 n2.jpg|thumb|left|Odysseus and the Sirens, eponymous vase of the [[Siren Painter]], ca. 480-470 BC, ([[British Museum]])]]
[[File:The Siren.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''The Siren'', by [[John William Waterhouse]] (circa 1900), depicted as a fish-chimera.]]

[[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]] were mythological, often dangerous and beautiful, creatures, portrayed as [[femme fatale|femmes fatales]] who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island.&lt;ref name=Karoglou&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|issue=Winter 2018|year=2018|last=Karoglou|first=Kiki|title=Dangerous Beauty: Medusa in Classical Art|pages=36–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were portrayed in both Greek and Roman mythology as sea deities who lured mariners, and in Roman lore were daughters of [[Phorcys]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]]. V. 846; [[Ovid]] XIV, 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Argonautica]]'' (4.891–919); ''[[Odyssey]]'' XII, 39; [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 141; [[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'' 712 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the hero [[Odysseus]], wishing to hear the sirens' seductive and destructive song, must protect himself and his crew by having his fellow sailors tie him to the [[mast (sailing)|mast]] and then stop their own ears with wax (''see image'').

In another myth, [[Hera]], queen of the gods, persuaded the Sirens to enter a singing contest with the [[Muse]]s, which the Sirens lost;&lt;ref name=Lempriere&gt;Lemprière 768.&lt;/ref&gt; out of their anguish, writes [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera, Greece|Aptera]] ("featherless"), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called [[Souda (island)|''Souda'']] (modern Lefkai).&lt;ref&gt;Caroline M. Galt, "A marble fragment at Mount Holyoke College from the Cretan city of Aptera", ''Art and Archaeology'' '''6''' (1920:150).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Denarius Sextus Pompeius-Scilla.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Scylla on the reverse of a first century B.C. [[denarius]] minted by [[Sextus Pompeius]]]]
Another mythological creature, the [[Scylla]], is a similar female sea demon that is both dangerous yet beautiful.&lt;ref name=Karoglou /&gt; Sirens supposedly "lured mariners to their deaths with their melodious, enchanting song", while "Scylla sent countless sailors to the depths of the sea."&lt;ref name=Karoglou /&gt;

===Albatross===
The [[albatross]] as a superstitious relic is referenced in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s well-known poem [[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]].  It is considered very unlucky to kill an albatross; in Coleridge's poem, the narrator killed the bird and his fellow sailors eventually force him to wear the dead bird around his neck.

Having [[banana]]s on a ship, especially on a private boat or fishing yacht, is considered bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/luck/superstition/bananas.asp|title=Banana Ban |work=Snopes.com|last=Mikkelson|first=Barbara|date=November 13, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whistling===
Whistling is usually considered to be bad luck with the possible exception of the sources mentioned below. It is said that to whistle is to challenge the wind itself, and that to do so will bring about a storm. Another tale is that it has been considered bad luck ever since the mutiny aboard HMS ''Bounty''; [[Fletcher Christian]] is said to have used a whistle as the signal to begin the mutiny against Captain [[William Bligh]].

==Good luck==
Sailors also had a culture of items or practices that were believed to bring [[good luck]], or trinkets to ward off bad luck or the evil eye.

===Cats===

[[File:Tiddles cat.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Tiddles'', a black cat who gained fame as a [[Royal Navy]] [[ship's cat]].]]
While [[Cultural depictions of cats|in many cultures]], a [[black cat]] is considered unlucky, British and Irish sailors considered adopting a black "[[ship's cat]]" because it would bring good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions  |last=Eyers |first=Jonathan |year=2011 |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location=London|isbn=978-1-4081-3131-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Symbols and Imagery|last=de Vries|first=Ad|year=1976 |publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0-7204-8021-3|pages=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some logic to this belief: cats eat (or at least kill) rodents, which can damage ropes and stores of grain on board, and they are intelligent animals, a high level of care was directed toward them to keep them happy, and research has backed up this superstition. Evidence published in 2017 by a [[genetics|geneticist]] the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Leuven]] shows that Egyptian cats spread their [[mitochondrial DNA]] through shipping lanes to medieval northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/06/cats-are-an-extreme-outlier-among-domestic-animals/|work=[[ArsTechnica]]|date=19 June 2017|title=Cats are an extreme outlier among domestic animals|last=Newitz|first=Annalee|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Briggs|first1=Helen|title=How cats conquered the ancient world|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40306897|accessdate=19 June 2017|work=BBC News|date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary results of that genetic study concluded that cats were also carried on trading ships to control rodents, and that practice was adopted by traders from other nations, including [[Vikings]] in northern Germany around the 8th to 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cats sailed with Vikings to conquer the world, genetic study reveals|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/cats-sailed-with-vikings-to-conquer-the-world-genetic-study-reveals|website=www.sciencealert.com|date=23 September 2016|publisher=Science Alert|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sailors believed that [[polydactyl cats]] were better at catching pests, possibly connected with the suggestion that extra digits give a polydactyl cat better balance, important when at sea. Cats were believed to have [[miracle|miraculous]] powers that could protect ships from dangerous [[weather]]. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, it was thought that it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck.  Other beliefs included: if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a [[hail]]storm was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunwoody|first1=H.

===Cormorants===
{{see|Birds in culture}}

[[Cormorant]]s, in some Scandinavian areas, are considered a good omen; in particular, in Norwegian tradition spirits of those lost at sea come to visit their loved ones disguised as cormorants.&lt;ref name="Murphy-Hiscock2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arin Murphy-Hiscock|title=Birds - A Spiritual Field Guide: Explore the Symbology and Significance of These Divine Winged Messengers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYLYIJtWr-MC&amp;pg=PA48|date=18 January 2012|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-4405-2688-5|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whistling===
[[Whistling#Superstition|Whistling]] on board a sailing ship is thought to encourage the wind strength to increase.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This is regularly alluded to in the [[Aubrey-Maturin]] books by [[Patrick O'Brian]].
On boats and ships where whistling was taboo, the cook was usually excused, because as long as he was whistling, he was not stealing the food.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Klabautermann===
[[File:Klabautermann on ship.jpg|thumb|left|A Klabautermann on a ship, from ''Buch Zur See'', 1885.]]
Traditionally, a type of [[kobold]], called a [[Klabautermann]], lives aboard ships and helps sailors and [[fishermen]] on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea]] in their duties. He is a merry and diligent creature, with an expert understanding of most watercraft, and an irrepressible musical talent. He also rescues sailors washed overboard. The name comes from the [[Low German]] verb ''klabastern'' meaning "rumble" or "make a noise". An [[etymology]] deriving the name from the verb ''kalfatern'' ("to caulk") has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Leander Petzoldt, ''Kleines Lexikon der Dämonen und Elementargeister'', Becksche Reihe, 1990, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  A carved klabautermann image, of a small sailor dressed in [[yellow]] with a [[tobacco pipe]] and woollen sailor's cap, often carrying a caulking hammer, is attached to the mast as a symbol of good luck.  However, despite the positive attributes, there is one [[omen]] associated with his presence: no member of a ship blessed by his presence shall ever set eyes on him; he only ever becomes visible to the crew of a doomed ship.&lt;ref&gt;Melville, F., ''The Book of Faeries'' (2002 Quarto Publishing).&lt;/ref&gt;  The belief in Klabautermänner dates to at least the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;Ellett, Mrs. (Jan. 1846). "Traditions and Superstitions", ''The American Whig Review: A Whig Journal'', Vol. III. New York: George H. Colton. pp. 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Patron Saints===
Sailors have had several [[patron saint]]s.

[[Saint Nicholas]] is probably the most famous; according to his [[hagiography]], he calmed a storm by prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalrelief.org/church-in-action/75/75th-celebration-stories/the-story-of-st-nicholas|work=Episcopal Relief|title=The Story of St. Nicholas|author=|date=|accessdate=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Brendan the Navigator]] is also considered a patron saint of sailors and navigators, due to his mythical voyage to [[St. Brendan’s Island]].

Saint [[Erasmus of Formiae]], also known as Saint Elmo, may have become the patron of sailors because he is said to have continued preaching even after a thunderbolt struck the ground beside him. This prompted sailors, who were in danger from sudden storms and lightning, to claim his prayers. The electrical discharges at the mastheads of ships were read as a sign of his protection and came to be called "[[St. Elmo's Fire|Saint Elmo's Fire]]".&lt;ref name="Eyers, Jonathan 2011"&gt;Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions''. A&amp;C Black, London, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-3131-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=182 St. Erasmus (St. Elmo)]  ''Catholic Online''. Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, Saint Elmo's Fire was usually good luck in traditional sailor's lore, but because it is a sign of electricity in the air and interferes with [[compass]] readings, sailors sometimes regarded it as an omen of bad luck and stormy weather.&lt;ref&gt;Beliefs often can be contradictory.  For example, [[St. Elmo's fire]] is reported to have been seen during the [[Siege of Constantinople]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453. It reportedly was seen emitting from the top of the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] attributed it to a sign that the Christian God would soon come and destroy the conquering [[Muslim]] army. According to [[George Sphrantzes]], it disappeared just days before Constantinople fell, ending the Byzantine Empire.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collar-touching===
It is often considered lucky to touch the collar of a [[Sailor suit|sailor's suit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ht_02x-2JksC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;lpg=PA208&amp;dq=sailors+collar+lucky&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gAD6gjTFdC&amp;sig=VR6IYRmnQ9x7H28VjhIfkW2GY2Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r89eTsOVF4SzhAf1vbz7Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=sailors%20collar%20lucky&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Superstitions 1949, Edwin Radford, Mona A. Radford, Kessinger Publishing] (p. 208)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mermaids and mermen===
[[Mermaid]]s usually are considered lucky, but not universally.  In [[Trinidad and Tobago]], sea-dwelling mer-men "were known to grant a wish, transform mediocrity into genius and confer wealth and power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visittobago.gov.tt/our-culture/folktales|work=Visit Trinidad and Tobago|title=Folktales &amp; Superstitions|author=n.a.|date=n.d.|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mermaids appear in [[Cornish folklore|British folklore]] as unlucky omens, both foretelling disaster and provoking it.&lt;ref name="briggs"&gt;Katharine Briggs, ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures'', "Mermaids", p 287. {{ISBN|0-394-73467-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several variants of the [[ballad]] ''[[Sir Patrick Spens]]'' depict a mermaid speaking to the doomed ships. In some versions, she tells them they will never see land again; in others, she claims they are near shore, which they are wise enough to know means the same thing. Mermaids can also be a sign of approaching rough weather,&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 2, p 19, New York: Dover, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; and some have been described as monstrous in size, up to {{convert|2000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="briggs"/&gt;

Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale "[[The Little Mermaid]]" was published in 1837. The story was adapted into a Disney film with a [[bowdlerize]]d plot. In the original version, The Little Mermaid is the youngest daughter of a sea king who lives at the bottom of the sea. To pursue a prince with whom she has fallen in love, the mermaid gets a sea witch to give her legs and agrees to give up her tongue in return. Though she is found on the beach by the prince, he marries another. Told she must stab the prince in the heart to return to her sisters, she can't do it out of love for him. She then rises from the ocean and sees ethereal beings around her who explain that mermaids who do good deeds become daughters of the air, and after 300 years of good service they can earn a human soul.&lt;ref name="gilead2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hca.gilead.org.il/li_merma.html |author=Hans Christian Andersen | title=The Little Mermaid |publisher=Hca.gilead.org.il |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|world-famous statue]] of the Little Mermaid, based on Andersen's fairy tale, has been in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] since August 1913, with copies in 13 other locations around the world.&lt;ref name="WSJ Mich"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124865622123982685#mod=rss_whats_news_us |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iZbZU3o9?url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124865622123982685.html |archivedate=July 27, 2009 |title=In a Mermaid Statue, Danes Find Something Rotten in State of Michigan |first=Timothy |last=Aeppel |date=July 27, 2009 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Recreation/Pages/Public-Art/Downtown-Public-Art-Circuit-tour.aspx#mermaid |title=The Little Mermaid&amp;nbsp;– Downtown Public Art Circuit tour |publisher=The City of Calgary |accessdate=2012-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410074105/http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Recreation/Pages/Public-Art/Downtown-Public-Art-Circuit-tour.aspx#mermaid |archivedate=2012-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mermaidsofearth.com/mermaid-statues-mermaid-sculptures/public/the-little-mermaid-statue-copenhagen/ |title=Mermaids of Earth |publisher=Philip Jepsen |accessdate=May 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sailors would look for [[Egg case (Chondrichthyes)|mermaid's purses]] on beaches for signs of mermaids in the area.

[[Davy Jones' Locker|Davy Jones]] is a popular character in sailor's yore, especially of the gothic fictional variety.

===Sailor tattoos===

[[File:Tattooed sailor aboard the USS New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Tattooed sailor aboard the USS ''New Jersey'', 1944]]
[[Sailor tattoos]] are a visual way to preserve the culture of the maritime superstitions.  Sailors believed that certain symbols and [[talisman]]s would help them in when facing certain events in life; they thought that those symbols would attract good luck or bad luck in the worst of the cases:
{{quote|Sailors, at the constant mercy of the elements, often feel the need for religious images on their bodies to appease the angry powers that caused storms and drowning far from home.|Tattoo Archives &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tattooarchive.com/tattoo_history/religious_designs.html|title=Religious Designs|publisher=Tattoo Archives|year=2000|accessdate=July 24, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813194053/http://www.tattooarchive.com/tattoo_history/religious_designs.html|archivedate=August 13, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, the images of a pig and a hen were good luck; both animals are not capable of swimming, but they believed that God would look down upon a shipwreck and see an animal not capable of swimming and would take them into his hand and place them on land.  Another example of superstitions is the North Star (Nautical Star or [[compass rose]]); sailors had the belief that by wearing this symbol it would help them to find his or her way home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sailor Tattoos, Become a Cool Mariner|url=http://www.marineinsight.com/marine/life-at-sea/maritime-history/sailor-tattoos-become-a-cool-mariner/#ixzz1rWmmKP1R|publisher=Marine in Sight|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sailors designed mariner motifs of their own, according to their travel experiences in the ocean.

===Line-crossing===
{{main|Line-crossing ceremony}}

[[File:Crossing the Line Ceremony, USS Blue Ridge (LCC 19) on 16 May 2008.JPG|left|thumb|250px|U.S. Sailors and Marines participate in a line-crossing ceremony aboard [[USS Blue Ridge (LCC-19)|USS ''Blue Ridge'' (LCC-19)]] as the ship passes the Equator May 16, 2008. It has been a long naval tradition to initiate pollywogs, sailors who have never crossed the Equator, into the Kingdom of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] upon their first crossing of the Equator.]]

The [[Line-crossing ceremony]] commemorates a sailor's first crossing of the [[Equator]].  Its practices invoke good luck on the new sailor.  The ceremony of Crossing the Line is an initiation [[rite]] in the [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Canadian Navy]], [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Coast Guard]], [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and other navies that commemorates a sailor's first crossing of the Equator.&lt;ref name="Eyers, Jonathan 2011"/&gt; The tradition may have originated with ceremonies when passing [[headland]]s, and become a "folly" sanctioned as a boost to [[morale]],&lt;ref name="FitzRoy"&gt;[[Robert FitzRoy]] (1839) ''Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836'', London: Henry Colburn. pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F10.2&amp;pageseq=84 57–58].&lt;/ref&gt; or have been created as a test for seasoned sailors to ensure their new shipmates were capable of handling long rough times at sea. Sailors who have already crossed the Equator are nicknamed (Trusty) ''Shellbacks'', often referred to as ''Sons of [[Poseidon|Neptune]]''; those who have not are nicknamed (Slimy) ''Pollywogs'' (in 1832 the nickname ''griffins'' was noted &lt;ref name="Darwin"&gt;Keynes, R. D. ed. (2001) ''Charles Darwin's Beagle diary'', Cambridge University Press, pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=68 36–38].&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[File:Chrzest równikowy 4.JPG|thumb|right|Neptune and his entourage during a Polish line-crossing ceremony (''Chrzest równikowy'')]]

After crossing the line, Pollywogs receive [[subpoena]]s &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usni.org/store/item.asp?ITEM_ID=1239 Ceremonial Certificates - Neptune Subpoena]&lt;/ref&gt; to appear before ''King Neptune and his court'' (usually including his first assistant [[Davy Jones' Locker|Davy Jones]] and her Highness [[Amphitrite]] and often various dignitaries, who are all represented by the highest ranking seamen), who officiate at the ceremony, which is often preceded by a beauty contest of [[cross-dressing|men dressing up as women]]. Afterwards, some ''wogs'' may be "interrogated" by King Neptune and his entourage. During the ceremony, the Pollywogs undergo a number of increasingly embarrassing ordeals (such as wearing clothing inside out and backwards; crawling on hands and knees; being swatted with short lengths of firehose; kissing the Royal Baby's belly coated with axle grease, etc.), largely for the entertainment of the Shellbacks.  Once the ceremony is complete, a Pollywog receives a certificate &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usni.org/store/item.asp?ITEM_ID=1449 Ceremonial Certificates - Golden Shellback Certificate - Personalized]&lt;/ref&gt; declaring his new status.

U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] described his Crossing the Line ceremony aboard the "Happy Ship" ''[[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS Indianapolis]]'' with his "Jolly Companions" in a letter to his wife [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] on 26 November 1936:

The phrase ''[[wikt:over a barrel|over a barrel]]'', meaning to be in a [[dilemma]] or "a weak or difficult position", may refer to the [[first aid]] practice amongst sailors of placing a [[drowning]] victim's head over a barrel, and rolling his body over it, in an attempt to remove aspirated water from the person's lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/over+a+barrel|title=Over a barrel|accessdate=April 13, 2017|work=The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=2003|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this etymology is challenged, and may come instead from the custom of punishing a prisoner by [[flogging]] or [[paddling]] him while he is strapped to a barrel; there is no documentary evidence it was actually used specifically as a nautical phrase.&lt;ref name=Wilton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/site/comments/over_a_barrel/|title=Over a barrel|accessdate=April 13, 2017|work=Wordorigins.org|first=David|last=Wilton|date=December 26, 2006|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, the image created in the mind is that of total helplessness and loss of control,&lt;ref name=Wilton /&gt; which is a common anxiety of sailors in fear of corporal punishment.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/over-a-barrel.html|title=Over a barrel|accessdate=April 13, 2017|work=The Phrases Finder (UK)|first=Gary|last=Martin|date=December 26, 2006|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11334">'''Social sculpture''' is a phrase to describe an expanded concept of [[art]] that was invented by the artist and co-founder of the German Green Party, [[Joseph Beuys]]. Beuys created the term "social sculpture" to embody his understanding of art's potential to transform society. As a work of art, a social sculpture includes human activity that strives to structure and shape society or the environment. The central idea of a social sculptor is an artist who creates structures in society using language, thoughts, actions, and objects.

== Concept ==

[[Image:7thousand oaks.jpg|thumb|200px|Some of the [[7000 Oaks|7,000 Oaks]] planted between 1982 and 1987 for Documenta 7 (1982)]]
During the 1960s, Beuys formulated his central theoretical concepts concerning the social, cultural and political function and potential of art. Indebted to Romantic writers such as [[Novalis]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], Beuys was motivated by a utopian belief in the power of universal human creativity and was confident in the potential for art to bring about revolutionary change. These ideas were founded in the social ideas of [[anthroposophy]] and the work of [[Rudolf Steiner]], of which he was a vigorous and original proponent. This translated into Beuys' formulation of the concept of social sculpture, in which society as a whole was to be regarded as one great work of art (the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk) to which each person can contribute creatively (perhaps Beuys' most famous phrase, borrowed from Novalis, is "Everyone is an artist"). In the video "Willoughby SHARP,'' Joseph Beuys, Public Dialogues'' (1974/120 min)", a record of Beuys' first major public discussion in the U.S., Beuys elaborates three principles: Freedom, Democracy, and Socialism, saying that each of them depends on the other two in order to be meaningful.  In 1973, Beuys wrote:

: ''"Only on condition of a radical widening of definitions will it be possible for art and activities related to art [to] provide evidence that art is now the only evolutionary-revolutionary power. Only art is capable of dismantling the repressive effects of a senile social system that continues to totter along the deathline: to dismantle in order to build ‘A SOCIAL ORGANISM AS A WORK OF ART’… EVERY HUMAN BEING IS AN ARTIST who – from his state of freedom – the position of freedom that he experiences at first-hand – learns to determine the other positions of the TOTAL ART WORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER."''&lt;ref&gt;Beuys statement dated 1973, first published in English in Caroline Tisdall: Art into Society, Society into Art (ICA, London, 1974), p.48. Capitals in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he was invited to create a work for [[Documenta]] 7. He delivered a large pile of basalt stones. From above, one could see that the pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in the new location of the stone. [[7000 Oaks|7,000 oak trees]] were then planted in Kassel, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Reames, ''Arborsculpture: Solutions for a Small Planet'', 2005 p.42 {{ISBN|0-9647280-8-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project exemplified the idea that a social sculpture was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory.

In 1991, "[[The Thing (art project)|The Thing]]" took its inspiration from the concept of social sculpture.

In 2007, at [[Documenta|Documenta 12]], Kirill Preobrazhenskiy created work "Tram 4 Inner Voice Radio". His work was compared by critics with Beuys' oaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,488870,00.html Spiegel]:

Some of the art at this year's Documenta has escaped the confines of the exhibition halls and intervened in Kassel's public spaces -- like Kirill Preobrazhenskiy's "Tram 4 Inner Voice Radio," a sound installation played on a busy public transportation route.

This strategy has been tried before, though. From 1982 through 1987, Joseph Beuys came to Kassel and planted 7,000 trees alongside slabs of stone as part of an installation called "7,000 Oaks," for Documenta 7. Visitors still snap photos of the trees, which have become an internationally renowned work of art. Kassel residents rarely take a second glance.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization for direct democracy through plebiscite==
The "Organization for direct democracy through plebiscite" was founded by the artists Joseph Beuys, Johannes Stüttgen and Karl Fastabend on June 19, 1971 in Düsseldorf as a political organization. The goal was influencing social patterns with implementing Beuys' concept of the extended notion of art and the social sculpture via political means. Today,{{when|date=January 2016}} Johannes Stüttgen spread the idea for direct democracy with the project "Omnibus".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omnibus.org/fileadmin/omnibus.org/PDF/Sonstiges/4_Seiter_2008_engl_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==The individual ==
Beuys believed everybody was an artist. He once said "every sphere of human activity, even peeling a potato can be a work of art as long as it is a conscious act," the idea being that every decision you make should be thought out and attempt to make or contribute to a work of art which in the end is society.  Individuality and well-educated decisions are promoted in the person while the government is made of those decisions put into referendums.  This point of view invites followers to humble themselves by realizing that they are an important part of a whole not only an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, Danto, Mcevilley. Art On The Edge And Over, "Political Reformation: Joseph Beuys." 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Classical architecture]] a '''term''' or '''terminal figure''' (plural: '''terms''' or '''termini''') is a human head and bust that continues as a square  tapering pillar-like form.

The name derives from [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the Roman god of boundaries and boundary markers. If the bust is of [[Hermes]] as protector of boundaries in ancient Greek culture, with male genitals interrupting the plain base at the appropriate height, it may be called a '''[[herma]]''' or '''herm'''.  The crime of [[Alcibiades]] and his drinking-mates, for which [[Socrates]] eventually indirectly paid with his life, was the desecration of herm figures through Athens in the dead of night.

At the [[Temple of Artemis]] at Ephesus, the Lady of Ephesus, whom the Greeks identified with Artemis, was a many-breasted goddess encased in a tapering term, from which her feet protruded. (See illustration at [[Temple of Artemis]]).

In the architecture and the painted architectural decoration of the European [[Renaissance]] and the succeeding [[Classicism|Classical styles]], term figures are quite common. Often they represent minor deities associated with fields and vineyards and the edges of woodland, [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and [[faun]]s and [[Bacchante]]s especially, and they may be draped with garlands of fruit and flowers.

Term figures were a particularly characteristic feature of the 16th-century style in furniture and carved interior decoration that is called [[Antwerp Mannerism]]. Engravings disseminated the style through Germany and England.

Term figures as table supports or employed as candlestands (French ''guéridon'') were characteristic of the Late Baroque Louis XIV style in France, the Low Countries and England, revived in the neo-Palladian furniture designed by [[William Kent]] and employed again in the French Empire style of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetantiquegazette.com/furniture/1726_gueridon_definition/|title=Gueridon – definition|publisher=Internet Antique Gazette|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Circle''''' ({{lang-fa|دایره}}, [[Transliteration|translit.]]&amp;nbsp;'''''Dayereh''''') is a 2000 Iranian [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] produced and directed by [[Jafar Panahi]] that criticizes the treatment of [[women in Iran]]. The film has won several awards, including the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 2000, but it is banned in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/23/jailed-jafar-panahi-release-hopes | title=Jafar Panahi 'may soon be freed' | date=2010-05-23| author=Peter Beaumont | author2=Vanessa Thorpe | publisher=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film begins in a maternity ward of a hospital, where the mother of Solmaz Gholami is upset to learn that her daughter has just given birth to a girl, even though the [[ultrasound]] indicated that the baby would be a boy. Worrying that her in-laws will force their son to divorce her daughter, she tells another daughter to call her uncles.

At the phone booth, she passes by three young women, including Arezou and Nargess, who have just escaped prison. The three of them are trying to come up with money so that they can go to Nargess's home village. The third prisoner is immediately arrested, as she tries to pawn a gold chain, leaving just the two women. Nargess spots what she thinks is a landscape-painting of her hometown at a nearby shop and describes to Arezou the paradise awaiting them at the end of their bus journey. Arezou in the meantime finds enough money from an acquaintance to get Nargess a bus ticket, deciding not to go herself. The two of them separate.
 
At the bus station, however, Nargess can't get on the bus, because it is being searched by the police, and she is afraid that she will be arrested again. Instead she tries to find another prisoner, Pari, who also snuck out of the prison that day. Pari's father will not let her in the house, however, and just as Nargess leaves, Pari's two brothers arrive, and angrily force their way into the house, in order to "talk" to their sister. Pari manages to escape, and eventually makes her way to a hospital where she finds Elham, another former prisoner who has hidden her past and is now a nurse, married to a doctor.

From her conversation with Elham, we learn that Pari is pregnant, but the father of her baby has been executed, and she has no one to approve her having an abortion. Elham, concerned about arousing suspicions about her own past, is reluctant to do anything to help her, so Pari is left to wander the streets at night. Without ID, she cannot get into a hotel. At a street corner, she finds a mother trying to abandon her little girl, hoping that she will find a better life with a family. She continues wandering the street.

The mother is caught by an undercover police officer who thinks she is a prostitute, but she later manages to escape. Then, another woman who has been picked up as a prostitute is taken to prison. She is placed in a cell with other women we met so far in the film, and the phone rings outside the metal door. A guard answers and comes to the window, calling for Solmaz Gholami, the woman with a baby girl in the first scene, bringing the story to a full circle.

==Cast==
* Nargess Mamizadeh as Nargess
* Maryiam Parvin Almani as Arezou
* Mojgan Faramarzi as Prostitute
* Elham Saboktakin as Nurse
* Monir Arab as Ticket seller
* Solmaz Panahi as Solmaz
* [[Fereshteh Sadre Orafaee]] as Pari
* [[Fatemeh Naghavi]] as Mother
* Abbas Alizadeh as Pari's father
* Negar Ghadyani
* Liam Kimber as Sahij
* Ataollah Moghadas as Haji
* Khadijeh Moradi
* Maryam Shayegan as Parveneh
* Maedeh Tahmasebi as Maedeh

==Structure==
The film does not have a central [[protagonist]]: instead, it is constructed around a sequence of short interconnecting stories that illustrate the everyday challenges women face in [[Iran]]. Each story intersects, but none is complete, leaving the viewer to imagine both the background and the ending. All the actors are amateurs, except [[Fereshteh Sadre Orafaee]] who plays Pari, and [[Fatemeh Naghavi]], who plays the mother abandoning her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Jafar Panahi on the Fox Lorber DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the film, Panahi focuses on the little rules symbolizing difficulties of life for Iranian women, such as the need to wear a [[chador]] under certain circumstances, or not being allowed to travel alone. He frequently uses contrast to illustrate both happiness and misery in contemporary Tehran: for example, a marriage party, symbolizing a happy ending, takes place in the background while a young girl is abandoned. Similarly, the scene where Nargess describes to Arezou the beauty of the landscape of her hometown where she grew up playing with her brother, while taking care to point out the imperfections of the artist's hand, is a poignant reminder of hope and despair that runs as a common thread in the lives of his women characters throughout the film.

==Reception==
''The Circle'' received critical acclaim. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 93% "fresh" score based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site's consensus states: "Bleak, yet powerful, ''The Circle'' offers a searing indictment of the oppressive conditions experienced by women in Iran."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_circle_2001/ | title=The Circle (Dayereh) (2001) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] reports an 85 out of 100 score based on 28 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-circle | title=The Circle reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Gruffalo's Child''''' by [[Julia Donaldson]] and [[Axel Scheffler]] is the bestselling sequel to ''[[The Gruffalo]]''.

The story is about the Gruffalo's child (a daughter) who, despite her father's warning, sets off into the "deep dark wood" to find the "big bad mouse", the only thing her father is afraid of.

During her winter journey, she encounters the tracks of snake, owl, and fox from ''The Gruffalo'', each of whom she first suspects to be the "big bad mouse", but who in turn tell her where she can find the real "big bad mouse". Eventually, concluding she has been tricked by the animals (and perhaps her father), she sadly admits that she "doesn't believe in the 'big bad mouse{{'"}}.

At this point, she encounters the little mouse from ''The Gruffalo'', who previously tricked her father. The mouse invites her to meet the "big bad mouse", which he re-creates by using moonlight to project a tremendously enlarged, fearsome shadow. Believing the shadow to belong to the real "big bad mouse", the Gruffalo's child flees and returns to the Gruffalo cave with faith in her father restored.

The story repeats the "brains over brawn" theme, the creatures, and the easily flowing rhyme scheme ([[tetrameter]]) of its predecessor, ''The Gruffalo''.

'''''The Social Significance of the Modern Drama''''' is a 1914 treatise by [[Emma Goldman]] on political implications of significant playwrights in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Goldman, who had done significant work with [[Modernist drama, theatre and performance|Modernist dramatists]] (managing tours, hosting, publicizing, and lecturing), here published her analyses of the political implications of modern drama. The book featured analyses of the political—even radical—implications of the work of playwrights including [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Hermann Sudermann]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Edmond Rostand]], [[Brieux]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Stanley Houghton]], [[Githa Sowerby]],&lt;ref&gt;For more information on this little-known playwright, see Mark Brown, [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/aug/14/githa-sowerby-playwright-rutherford-son "Githa Sowerby, the Forgotten Playwright, Returns to Stage"], ''Guardian'', 2009/08/14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Lennox Robinson]], [[T. G. Murray]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Anton Tchekhof]] (more familiar in English as "Anton Chekhov"), [[Maxim Gorki]], and [[Leonid Andreyev]]. Goldman published the book as she set out on a tour, hoping to acquaint radicals and ordinary citizens alike to the radical potential of modern drama.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Waterman, [http://ahistoryofnewyork.com/2008/10/goldman-and-middleton-feminism-and-modern-drama/ "Goldman and Middleton: Feminism and Modern Drama"], ''Patell and Waterman's History of New York'', Oct. 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was first published in 1914, Richard G. Badger, The Gorham Press, in Boston, and in Toronto, the Copp Clark Co., Ltd. The book was not a commercial success, and was quickly out of print.&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Carlson &amp; Erika Munk, Foreword to the 2000 edition, Hal Leonard Corp., {{ISBN|0-936839-62-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theatre of Estonia''' dates to 1784 when [[August von Kotzebue]] founded an amateur theatre company in [[Tallinn]]. Most of the plays at the time were comedies for the amusement for local [[Baltic German]] nobility. In 1809 a professional theatre company was established, with its own building in Tallinn, the [[Tallinna saksa teater]]. The repertoire was mostly in German but plays in Estonian and Russian were also performed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IpR0-OrrwssC&amp;dq Culture And Customs of the Baltic States By Kevin O'Connor]&lt;/ref&gt;

After centuries of serfdom that was abolished in Estonia in 1816, the first native Estonian musical society, [[Vanemuine]], was established in 1865. The Vanemuine society's staging of [[Lydia Koidula]]'s ''The Cousin from Saaremaa'' in 1870 marks the birth of Estonian theatre.

The Vanemuine Music and Theatre Society was headed by [[August Wiera]] from 1878 to 1903. In 1906 a new building was erected for the society and the theatre company turned professional under the directorship of [[Karl Menning]]. Plays by Western writers such as [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], Russian [[Maksim Gorky]] and Estonian [[August Kitzberg]], [[Oskar Luts]] and [[Eduard Vilde]] were staged.

Also in 1906 the Estonia Music and Theatre Society in Tallinn turned professional under the leadership of [[Theodor Altermann]] and [[Paul Pinna]]. This company later became the [[Estonian National Opera]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8222">[[Image:Nikolaos Sopnianos, Totius Graeciae Descriptio.jpg|thumb|350px|frame|A 1558 version of the map]]
'''Totius Graeciae Descriptio''' refers to an early antiquarian [[map]] of [[Greece]] drawn by [[Renaissance]] humanist [[Nikolaos Sophianos]] that became a cartographical bestseller of the late 16th century.  It is eight pages and shows [[Greece]] from mythical times to the founding of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the establishment of [[Christianity]].  The map draws on many classical historians and thinkers, including [[Ptolemy]], [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Strabo]], and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].&lt;ref name="Ferando Bertelli: Totius Graeciae Descripto"&gt;Barry Lawrence Ruderman Antique Maps Inc. "Totius Graeciae Descriptio." Accessed October 6, 2014. [http://www.raremaps.com/gallery/archivedetail/23197/Totius_Graeciae_Descriptio/Bertelli.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The map was first published during [[Nikolaos Sophianos|Sophianos]]'s time in [[Rome]] in 1540.  It was published by Francesco Salamanca It was often copied and plagiarized, until it was finally standardized by inclusion in [[Ortelius]]'s historical atlas, the Parergon, in 1579.&lt;ref name ="Ferando Bertelli: Totius Graeciae Descripto" /&gt;  The creation of the map is an example of the movement in the sixteenth century of revived studies of [[Ancient Greece]]. [[Nikolaos Sophianos|Sophianos]] also integrates an attempt to merge the classical and contemporary by using ancient geographical names on a contemporary map, which reflected a societal interest in linking many aspects together, including [[Greece]] and [[Rome]], [[Catholicism]] and [[Orthodoxy]], and even [[Paganism]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name= "George Tolias, ''Nikolaos Sophianos's Totius Graeciae Descriptio"&gt;George Tolias, ''Nikolaos Sophianos's Totius Graeciae Descriptio: The Resources, Diffusion and Function of a Sixteenth-Century Antiquarian Map of Greece'', Imago Mundi, 58(2), July 2006 , p.p. 150 – 182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the map==
The map is labeled principally in Latin, and in addition Greek is given for certain seas and regions.  Early editions of the map displayed only the ancient Greek names for cities, however later editions also showed modern names.&lt;ref name= "Transformation of Hellenism"&gt;Tolias, Giorgos. "Nikolaos Sophianos's Map of Greece and the Transformation of Hellenism." Journal of Modern Greek Studies 19, no. 1 (201): 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Representations of Major Cities===
Certain cities are given special representation on Sohpianos's map because of their cultural, political, or historical significance:&lt;ref name ="Ferando Bertelli: Totius Graeciae Descripto" /&gt;
*[[Athens]] is represented as the principal city on the map, with the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] at its center, its harbor at [[Piraeus]], and long walls enclosing the city.
*[[Byzantium]] is depicted with high walls surrounding the [[Hagia Sophia|Cathedral of Saint Sophia]].
*[[Delphi]] and [[Delos]] are drawn as temples and labeled because of their [[Pythia|religious significance]].
*[[Troy]] is the only settlement to be shown as ruins, and represents the oldest level of Greek history shown on the map.

==Comparisons with [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy's ''Geography'']]==
Initially, [[Nikolaos Sophianos|Sophianos]]'s map is based on [[Geography (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy's ''Geography'']].  This is apparent in the shape of the coastlines, rivers, and division of Greece.  However, [[Nikolaos Sophianos|Sophianos]] departed from Ptolemy's work by describing [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] geography.  A notable feature is how [[Nikolaos Sophianos|Sophianos]]'s Greece covers the [[Balkans]] south of the [[Danube]] and western [[Asia Minor]], whereas [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] extends to north to [[Epirus]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]].  Also, [[Ptolemy]] limited his geographical names to the contemporary second century place names, while Sophianos takes names from all of [[Greek history]], from the [[Argonauts]] and the [[Trojan War]], to the late Roman period.  The map also shows nearly 2,000 place names of Greek antiquity, double that of [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref name ="Ferando Bertelli: Totius Graeciae Descripto" /&gt;

==Lost Editions==
The first editions of the map (1540–1545) are believed to be lost. Some references were collected and published by Emile Legrand in 1885 and this data was the basis for recent bibliographical entries.  From literary allusions, it was established that the first editions were published in 1540. Examples of the 1545 edition have been rediscovered and it is now possible to reconstruct the map's history and content thus shedding light on the methodology and practice of early modern antiquarian [[cartography]] of [[Greece]].&lt;ref name= "George Tolias, ''Nikolaos Sophianos's Totius Graeciae Descriptio" /&gt;

==Re-Issues==
Totius Graeciae Descriptio was warmly received by contemporary [[cartographer]]s, and was indirectly adopted as the definition of modern [[Greece]].&lt;ref name= "Transformation of Hellenism" /&gt;  Consequently, the profound map was reprinted many times.  
*The first was in [[Basel]] in 1544 and 1545 by Oporin.  The eight page map is believed to be very similar to [[Nikolaos Sophianos|Sophianos]]'s original map in the essentials.  It is dedicated to [[Cosimo de'Medici]].  For the 1545 edition, Oporin commissioned an introduction, called the ''[[Praefatio]]'', from Nicholas Gerbel, which was a 90-page folio describing the academic use of the elaborate map, elaborating on how to color the map, as well as other aspects.  The ''Praefatio'' also included 21 woodcut imaginary illustrations of Greek cities.&lt;ref name= "Transformation of Hellenism" /&gt;  Also, all of the over 2,000 place names are listed in the ''Praefatio''.  It is unclear if Sophianos had any influence on the writing of the ''Praefatio''.&lt;ref name= "George Tolias, ''Nikolaos Sophianos's Totius Graeciae Descriptio" /&gt;  Both the 1544 and 1545 versions were assumed to be lost, until a copy of the 1545 edition surfaced at an auction at [[Sotheby's]], London in 2004.&lt;ref name= "Rare Maps"&gt;Schreiber, E K. Rare Books September 2014 List Recent Acquisitions of 15th-17th-Century Books. New York: E. K. Schreiber, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1550, Oporin re-issued a revised edition of the ''Praefatio'' in [[Basel]], now numbering over 300 pages, further detailing the analytical geographic history of [[Greece]], physical descriptions of geographical features, and culture of [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref name= "George Tolias, ''Nikolaos Sophianos's Totius Graeciae Descriptio" /&gt;
*Also in 1545, another edition was being printed in [[Venice]] by Giovanni Andrea Vavassore.  It was much smaller, only two pages.  It is believed that [[Nikolaos Sophianos|Sophianos]] was involved with the printing of this edition, as he was in [[Venice]] at the time of printing.  This suggests that the [[Venice]] printing may be the closest to the original 1540 printing that was lost.&lt;ref name= "George Tolias, ''Nikolaos Sophianos's Totius Graeciae Descriptio" /&gt;
*Yet another edition was printed in 1552 in Rome.  It was printed from four copper plates and is said to have been the closest to the original by Hieronymus in 1984.  Additional editions were published in 1558, 1562, 1564, 1566, and 1569, all with slight alterations.&lt;ref name= "George Tolias, ''Nikolaos Sophianos's Totius Graeciae Descriptio" /&gt;
*In 1579, the map was finally standardized by [[Abraham Ortelius]]'s atlas the ''Parergon'', and was based directly on the 1545 [[Basel]] print.  Subsequently, several other editions were published, with different dedications and ''Praefatio'''s into the 17th century.&lt;ref name= "George Tolias, ''Nikolaos Sophianos's Totius Graeciae Descriptio" /&gt;

The '''University of Chicago Press''' is the largest and one of the oldest [[university press]]es in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29487771_ITM|title=The University of Chicago Press Selects Rightslink(R) For Online Copyright Permissions|date=February 5, 2007|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is operated by the [[University of Chicago]] and publishes a wide variety of academic titles, including ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', numerous academic journals, and advanced monographs in the academic fields.

One of its quasi-independent projects is the [[BiblioVault]], a digital repository for scholarly books.

The Press building is located just south of the [[Midway Plaisance]] on the University of Chicago campus.

==History==
[[File:University of Chicago, Harper Library.jpg|thumb|University of Chicago, [[University of Chicago Library|Harper Library]]]]
The University of Chicago Press was founded in 1891, making it one of the oldest continuously operating university presses in the United States. Its first published book was Robert F. Harper's ''Assyrian and Babylonian Letters Belonging to the Kouyunjik Collections of the British Museum''. The book sold five copies during its first two years, but by 1900 the University of Chicago Press had published 127 books and pamphlets and 11 scholarly journals, including the current ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', ''[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]'', and  ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''.

For its first three years, the Press was an entity discrete from the university; it was operated by the Boston publishing house [[D. C. Heath and Company|D. C. Heath]] in conjunction with the Chicago printer [[RR Donnelley|R. R. Donnelley]]. This arrangement proved unworkable, however, and in 1894 the university officially assumed responsibility for the Press.

In 1902, as part of the university, the Press started working on the ''Decennial Publications''. Composed of articles and monographs by scholars and administrators on the state of the university and its faculty's research, the ''Decennial Publications'' was a radical reorganization of the Press. This allowed the Press, by 1905, to begin publishing books by scholars not of the University of Chicago. A manuscript editing and proofreading department was added to the existing staff of printers and typesetters, leading, in 1906, to the first edition of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]''.

By 1931, the Press was an established, leading academic publisher. Leading books of that era include [[Edgar J. Goodspeed|Dr. Edgar J. Goodspeed's]] ''The New Testament: An American Translation'' (the Press's first nationally successful title) and its successor, Goodspeed and J. M. Povis Smith's ''The Complete Bible: An American Translation''; [[William Craigie|Sir William Alexander Craigie's]] [[Dictionary of American English|''A Dictionary of American English on Historical Principles'']], published in four volumes in 1943; John Manly and Edith Rickert's ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', published in 1940; and  [[Kate Turabian|Kate Turabian's]] ''[[A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations]]''.

In 1956, the Press first published paperback-bound books (including the Phoenix Books series)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishinghistory.com/phoenix-books-university-of-chicago-press.html Phoenix Books (University of Chicago Press) - Book Series List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022142804/http://www.publishinghistory.com/phoenix-books-university-of-chicago-press.html |date=2017-10-22 }}, publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 22 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; under its imprint. Of the Press's best-known  books, most date from the 1950s, including translations of the ''Complete Greek Tragedies'' and [[Richmond Lattimore|Richmond Lattimore's]] [[Iliad|''The Iliad of Homer'']]. That decade also saw the first edition of ''A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature'', which has since been used by students of [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] worldwide.

In 1966, [[Morris Philipson]] began his thirty-four-year tenure as director of the University of Chicago Press. He committed time and resources to lengthening the backlist, becoming known for assuming ambitious scholarly projects, among the largest of which was ''[[Lisle Letters|The Lisle Letters]]'' — a vast collection of 16th-century correspondence by [[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle]], a wealth of information about every aspect of sixteenth-century life.

As the Press's scholarly volume expanded, the Press also advanced as a trade publisher. In 1992, [[Norman Maclean]]'s books ''[[A River Runs Through It (novel)|A River Runs Through It]]'' and ''[[Young Men and Fire]]'' were national best sellers, and ''A River Runs Through It'' was made into a [[A River Runs Through It (film)|film]] directed by and starring [[Robert Redford]].

In 1982, Philipson was the first director of an academic press to win the ''Publisher Citation'', one of [[International PEN|PEN's]] most prestigious awards. Shortly before he retired in June 2000, Philipson received the [[Association of American Publishers|Association of American Publishers']] ''Curtis Benjamin Award for Creative Publishing'', awarded to the person whose "creativity and leadership have left a lasting mark on American publishing."

[[Paula Barker Duffy]] served as director of the Press from 2000 to 2007. Under her administration, the Press expanded its distribution operations and created the Chicago Digital Distribution Center and [[BiblioVault]]. Editorial depth in reference and regional books increased with titles such as ''[[The Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', Timothy J. Gilfoyle's ''Millennium Park'', and new editions of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', the [[A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations|Turabian Manual]], and ''The University of Chicago Spanish Dictionary.'' The Press also launched an electronic reference work, The Chicago Manual of Style Online.

In 2014, the Press received the ''The International Academic and Professional Publisher Award'' for excellence at the [[London Book Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/awards-and-prizes/article/61786-london-book-fair-2014-excellence-award-winners-revealed.html |title=London Book Fair 2014: Excellence Award Winners Revealed |website=PublishersWeekly.com |language=en |access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
[[Garrett P. Kiely]] became the 15th director of the University of Chicago Press on September 1, 2007. He heads one of academic publishing's largest operations, employing more than 300 people across three divisions—books, journals, and distribution—and publishing 72 journal titles and approximately 280 new books and 70 paperback reprints each year.

The Press publishes over 50 new trade titles per year, across many subject areas. It also publishes regional titles, such as ''[[The Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'' (2004), edited by James R. Grossman, Ann Durkin Keating, and Janice Reiff;&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo3617598.html Grossman, Keating, and Reiff, eds.

The Press has recently expanded its digital offerings to include most newly published books as well as key backlist titles. In 2013, Chicago Journals began offering e-book editions of each new issue of each journal, for use on e-reader devices such as [[smartphone]]s, [[iPad]], and [[Amazon Kindle]]. The contents of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' are available online to paid subscribers. The Chicago Distribution Center is recognized as a leading distributor of scholarly works, with over 100 client presses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.uchicago.edu/press/about.html "About the Press," ''University of Chicago Press'', accessed April 23, 2015.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415050133/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/press/about.html |date=April 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016 it publishes [[List of University of Chicago Press journals|72 titles]] in a wide range of academic disciplines including the biological and medical sciences, education, the humanities, the physical sciences, and the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.uchicago.edu|title=The University of Chicago Press: Journals|author=|date=|website=journals.uchicago.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All are peer-reviewed journals of original scholarship, with readerships that include scholars, scientists, and medical practitioners as well as interested, educated laypeople. The Journals Division has been a pioneer in making scholarly and scientific journals available in electronic form in conjunction with their print editions. [[Electronic publishing]] efforts were launched in 1995; by 2004 all the journals published by the University of Chicago Press were available online. In 2013, all new journal issues were also made available to subscribers in [[e-book]] format.

===Chicago Distribution Center===
The Distribution Services Division provides the University of Chicago Press's customer service, warehousing, and related services. The Chicago Distribution Center (CDC) began providing distribution services in 1991, when the [[University of Tennessee Press]] became its first client. Currently{{when|date=January 2015}} the CDC serves nearly 100 publishers including [[Northwestern University Press]], [[Stanford University Press]], [[Temple University Press]], [[University of Iowa Press]], [[University of Minnesota Press]], and many others. Since 2001, with development funding from the [[Mellon Foundation]], the Chicago Digital Distribution Center (CDDC) has been offering digital printing services and the [[BiblioVault]] digital repository services to book publishers.

The Chicago Distribution Center has also partnered with an additional 15 presses, including the [[University of Missouri Press]], [[West Virginia University Press]], and publications of the [[Getty Foundation]].

'''WhatsOnMyBookshelf''' was an international online [[book swapping]] and book trading community launched in 2006 by Dan Ostermayer
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.whatsonmybookshelf.com |title = About Us |last  =  |first =|date  = 2013-07-10|website = |publisher  = whatsonmybookshelf.com|accessdate = 2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had over 4000 users who swaped an average of 10 books daily

The total number of shippable books registered by the site was 22,535 as of July 9, 2013
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url   =  http://www.whatsonmybookshelf.com |title = Main Page |last  =  |first =|date  = |website = |publisher  = |accessdate = 2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==

WhatsOnMyBookshelf, when compared to other book swapping&lt;ref&gt;For a comprehensive list see:  http://www.swaptrees.com/swap_books.php and http://www.librarything.com/wiki/index.php/Comparison_of_Book_Swapping_Websites&lt;/ref&gt; communities, had a relatively small but dedicated community of swappers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url   = http://www.moneytalksnews.com/2011/12/13/the-4-best-sites-for-trading-in-your-old-books/ |title =  The 4 Best Sites for Trading in Your Old Books |last  =  Colley|first = Angela |date  = |website = Money Talks News |publisher  = |accessdate = 2013-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site started out as a home for fiction books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url   = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115879588172669481 |title = Online Book Swapping |last  = Vascerallo |first = Jessica |date  = September 21, 2006 |website = WSJ Online |publisher  =|accessdate = 2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Registering and using the site was free, the only requirements that users needed to provide their addresses and they should be able to ship books to other users through postal services.

==Swapping method==

The site used a point system as a form of book swapping currency. This method makes using the site flexible, however less personal than other book swapping communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url   =  http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6097014-7.html?part=rss&amp;tag=6097014&amp;subj=news |title = Points and other forms of currency allow more flexibility, but Swaptree's person-to-person system makes it more appealing to some |last  = Yamamoto |first = Mike |date  = 2006-07-21|website = CNET |publisher  =|accessdate = 2013-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New users received a 1-point bonus per every five book that they registered. After having registered the first 100 books, this incentive is no longer valid and users receive points only for shipping books to other users (which means that the users have to pay the postal fees for sending the books, but receiving a book is free). Though the site offers a free service, users may purchase 5 points per month if they wish to (purchased points cost $2 each).

Book value points are calculated based upon the new book price of the book in question ($20 – 1 credit point).

Users can request a book by adding it to their shopping cart. The user in possession of the book has to ship it within 5 days and mark the request as “sent”. Similarly, the recipient is obligated to mark the request as “received” immediately upon delivery.

The site has an [[API]], and it is possible to embed WhatsOnMyBookshelf in other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url   = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jun/21/comment.guardianweeklytechnologysection |title = It's a new online chapter for books |last  = Keegan |first = Victor |date  = 2007-06-21 |website = The Guardian |publisher  =|accessdate = 2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Firefox add-on is also available to users so that they can manage their wish-lists.

==Ranking and Technical Information==

According to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] page ranks, the site was the 6,296,551th most popular website in the world as of 7 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;whatsonmybookshelf.com page metrics on Alexa (as of July 8, 2013): http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/whatsonmybookshelf.com&lt;/ref&gt; The site is officially registered by WhatsOnMyBookshelf (Moscow, PA), with Dan Ostermayer as its technical and administrative contact.&lt;ref&gt;WHOIS result for whatsonmybookshelf.com, http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/results.jsp?domain=whatsonmybookshelf.com.

'''October in Kragujevac Memorial Park''' ({{lang-sr|italic=yes|Spomen-park „Kragujevački oktobar"}}, Спомен-парк „Крагујевачки октобар"), also known as '''Šumarice Memorial Park''' (''Memorijalni park Šumarice'', Меморијални парк Шумарице), is the site near [[Kragujevac]], [[Serbia]] of the [[Kragujevac massacre|execution of an estimated 3,000 men and boys]] of the town by the [[Germany|German]] occupation forces on October 21, 1941, during [[World War II]]. 

According to noted historian [[Philip J. Cohen]], "All males from the town between the ages of sixteen and sixty were assembled and the victims -- including high school students -- were selected from among them."&lt;ref&gt;Philip. J. Cohen, "Serbia's Secret War", p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monument]]s within the [[park]] include the monument to the murdered schoolchildren and their teachers (the "Interrupted Flight" monument); the "Monument of pain and defiance"; the "One hundred for one" monument; the "Resistance and Freedom" monument, and the monument to shoe cleaners.

The 21 October Museum is located at the site of the massacre.
