[[File:Cross-section of a subduction zone and back-arc basin.jpg|thumb|300px|Cross-section through the shallow part of a subduction zone showing the relative positions of an active magmatic arc and back-arc basin, such as the southern part of the [[Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc]].]]

'''Back-arc basins''' are geologic [[Structural basin|basins]], submarine features associated with [[island arc]]s and [[subduction zones]]. They are found at some [[convergent boundary|convergent plate boundaries]], presently concentrated in the western [[Pacific Ocean]]. Most of them result from [[Tension (physics)|tensional forces]] caused by [[oceanic trench]] rollback (the oceanic trench is wandering in the seafloor direction) and the collapse of the edge of the continent. The arc crust is under [[Extension (geology)|extension]] or rifting as a result of the sinking of the subducting slab. Back-arc basins were initially a surprising result for [[plate tectonics]] theorists, who expected convergent boundaries to be zones of compression, rather than major extension. However, they are now recognized as consistent with this model in explaining how the interior of [[Earth]] loses heat.

[[Image:BAB formation.jpg|thumb|300px|Cross-section sketch showing the development of a back-arc basin by rifting the arc longitudinally. The rift matures to the point of seafloor spreading, allowing a new magmatic arc to form on the trenchward side of the basin (to the right in this image) and stranding a remnant arc on the far side of the basin (to the left in this image).]]

== Characteristics ==
Back-arc basins are typically very long (several hundreds to thousands of kilometers) and relatively narrow (a few hundred kilometers). The restricted width of back-arc basins is probably because magmatic activity depends on water and induced mantle convection and these are both concentrated near the subduction zone. Spreading rates vary from very slow spreading ([[Mariana Trough]]), a few centimeters per year, to very fast ([[Lau Basin]]), 15&amp;nbsp;cm/year. These ridges erupt [[basalt]]s that are similar to those erupted from the [[mid-ocean ridges]]; the main difference is that back-arc basin basalts are often very rich in [[magmatic water]] (typically 1-1.5 weight % H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), whereas mid-ocean ridge basalt magmas are very dry (typically &lt;0.3 weight % H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). The high water contents of back-arc basin basalt magmas is derived from water carried down the subduction zone and released into the overlying mantle wedge. Additional source of water could be the [[eclogitization]] of [[amphiboles]] and [[mica]]s in the subducting slab. Similar to mid-ocean ridges, back-arc basins have [[hydrothermal vent]]s and associated [[chemosynthetic]] communities.

[[Image:Japan separation.png|thumb|300px|right|The islands of Japan were separated from mainland Asia by back-arc spreading]]

== Asymmetry ==
Back-arc basins are different from normal [[mid-ocean ridge]]s because they are characterized by asymmetric [[seafloor spreading]], but this is quite variable even within single basins. For example, in the central Mariana Trough current spreading rates are 2-3 times greater on the western flank&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deschamps |first=A. |first2=T. |last2=Fujiwara |year=2003 |title=Asymmetric accretion along the slow-spreading Mariana Ridge |pages=8622|journal=Geochem., Geophys., Geosyst. |volume=4 |doi=10.1029/2003GC000537 |issue=10|bibcode = 2003GGG.....4.8622D }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas at the southern end of the Mariana Trough the position of the spreading center adjacent to the volcanic front suggests that overall crustal accretion has been nearly 100% asymmetric there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2000JB900117 |first=F. |last=Martinez |first2=P. |last2=Fryer |first3=N. |last3=Becker |year=2000 |title=Geophysical Characteristics of the Southern Mariana Trough, 11N-13N |journal=[[J.

== Formation and sedimentation ==
Back-arc basins are hypothesized to form as a result of '''[[Oceanic trench#Trench rollback|trench rollback]]''' (also, '''hinge rollback'''). This is the backward motion of the subduction zone relative to the motion of the plate which is being subducted. As the subduction zone and its associated trench pull backward, the overriding plate is stretched, thinning the crust which is manifest in the back-arc basin. Therefore, back-arc basins form when the overriding plate is under extension. In some cases, extension is triggered by the entrance of a buoyant feature in the subduction zone, which locally slows down subduction and induce the subducting plate to rotate adjacent to it. This rotation is associated with trench retreat and overriding plate extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Laura M.|last2=Ellis|first2=Susan|last3=Mann|first3=Paul|date=2009|title=Collisional model for rapid fore-arc block rotations, arc curvature, and episodic back-arc rifting in subduction settings|url=https://doi.org/10.1029/2008GC002220|journal=Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems|language=en|volume=10|issue=5|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1029/2008gc002220|issn=1525-2027|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The thinning of the overriding plate at the back-arc (i.e., back-arc rifting) can lead to the formation of new oceanic crust (i.e., back-arc spreading). As the lithosphere stretches, the [[Asthenosphere|asthenospheric mantle]] below rises to shallow depths and partially melts due to adiabatic decompression melting. 

Sedimentation is strongly asymmetric, with most of the sediment supplied from the active magmatic arc which regresses in step with the rollback of the trench.

[[Image:BAB of the World -Converted-.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The active back-arc basins of the world]]

== Location ==
Active back-arc basins are found in the Marianas, Tonga-Kermadec, S. Scotia, Manus, N. Fiji, and [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] regions, but most are found in the Western Pacific. Not all subduction zones have back-arc basins, some like the central Andes are associated with rear-arc compression. In addition, there are a number of extinct or fossil back-arc basins, such as the Parece Vela-Shikoku Basin, [[Sea of Japan]], and Kurile Basin.

The [[Black Sea]] formed from two separate back-arc basins.

== History of thought ==
With the development of [[plate tectonic]] theory, geologists thought that convergent plate margins were zones of compression, thus zones of strong extension above subduction zones (back-arc basins) were not expected. The hypothesis that some convergent plate margins were actively spreading was developed by Dan Karig (1970) while a graduate student at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Daniel E. |last=Karig |title=Ridges and basins of the Tonga-Kermadec island arc system |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=239–254 |year=1970 |doi=10.1029/JB075i002p00239 |bibcode=1970JGR....75..239K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted from several marine geologic expeditions to the Western Pacific.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6236">The '''bean nighe''' ([[Scottish Gaelic]] for "[[washerwoman]]" or "laundress") is a female spirit in [[Scottish folklore]], regarded as an omen of death and a messenger from the [[Otherworld]].  She is a type of ''bean sìth'' (in [[Irish language|Irish]], ''bean sídhe'', anglicized as "[[banshee]]") that haunts desolate streams and washes the clothing of those about to die. ''[[Les Lavandières]]'' is the French word under which these "night washerwomen" are perhaps best known.

==Legends==
The ''bean nighe'', also known as the Washing Woman or Washer at the Ford, is seen in lonely places beside a stream or pool, washing the blood from the linen and grave-clothes of those who are about to die. Her characteristics vary depending on the locality, and differing traditions ascribe to her the powers of imparting knowledge or the granting of wishes if she is approached with caution. It is said that ''mnathan nighe'' (the plural of ''bean nighe'') are the spirits of [[maternal mortality|women who died giving birth]] and are doomed to perform their tasks until the day their lives would have normally ended.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. Pantheon Books. pp. 19–20. {{ISBN|0394409183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also believed that this fate could be avoided if all the clothing left by the deceased woman had been washed. Otherwise, she would have to finish this task after death.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (1976). p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Camp&gt;Campbell, John Gregorson (1900). ''Superstitions of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland''. Glasgow: James MacLehose and Sons. pp. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Isles of [[Mull]] and [[Tiree]] she was said to have unusually long breasts that interfere with her washing so she throws them over her shoulders and lets them hang down her back. Those who see her must not turn away, but quietly approach from behind so that she is not aware. He should then take hold of one of her breasts, put it in his mouth, and claim to be her foster-child (see [[Milk kinship]]). She will then impart to him whatever knowledge he desires. If she says the clothing she is washing belongs to an enemy then he can allow the washing to continue, but if it belongs to himself or any of his friends then he can stop her from completing her task and avoid his fate.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt;

On the [[Isle of Skye]] the bean nighe was said to have a squat figure resembling a "small pitiful child". If a person catches her she will reveal to him his ultimate fate. She answers all his questions but he must also truthfully answer hers in return. If however the bean nighe sees him first then he will [[paralysis|lose the use of his limbs]].&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt;

In [[Perthshire]] she was described as small and rotund and dressed in green, and can be caught by getting between her and the stream.&lt;ref name=Camp/&gt;

The ''bean nighe'' is sometimes said to sing a mournful dirge as she washes the clothing of someone who is about to meet a sudden death by violence. If a person can seize hold of her after a stealthy approach then she will reveal who is about to die and will also grant three wishes.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Donald (1935). ''Scottish Folklore and Folk Life''. Blackie &amp; Son Limited. p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; She is sometimes described as having various physical defects including having only one nostril, a large protruding front tooth, or red webbed feet.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (1976). pp. 16, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] story connected with the washing of death shrouds regards the so-called "Mermaid of Loch Slin". A maiden from [[Cromarty]] was walking along a path by the side of this [[loch]] one Sabbath morning, and after turning a corner she saw a tall woman standing in the water "knocking claes" (clothes) on a stone with a bludgeon. On a nearby bleaching-green she observed more than thirty smocks and shirts, all smeared with blood. Shortly following the appearance of this figure, the roof of [[Fearn Abbey]] collapsed during worship service, burying the congregation in debris and killing thirty-six people.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor, Alasdair Alpin (1937). ''The Peat-Fire Flame: Folktales and Traditions of the Highlands and Islands''. The Moray Press. p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the abbey roof did collapse in 1742 with the death toll reckoned at nearly fifty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fearn Abbey|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/balintore/fearnabbey/index.html|website=Undiscovered Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
A ''bean nighe'' ("washerwoman") is a specific type of ''bean sìth''.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;[[John Gregorson Campbell|Campbell, John Gregorson]] (1900, 1902, 2005) ''The Gaelic Otherworld''. Edited by Ronald Black. Edinburgh, Birlinn Ltd. {{ISBN|1-84158-207-7}} p.311: "A ''bean shìth'' is any otherworld woman; the ''bean nighe'' is a specific otherworld woman."&lt;/ref&gt;  

Both the Irish ''[[banshee|bean sídhe]]''  and the Scottish Gaelic ''bean sìth'' (both meaning "woman of the sídhe", "fairy woman" or "woman of peace") are derived from the Old Irish ''ben síde'', "fairy woman": ''bean'': woman, and ''sídhe'': the [[genitive]] of "fairy".

In Scottish Gaelic, ''bean sìth'' can also be spelled ''bean-shìdh''. Both are correct. 

''Sìth'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]] (''síd'' in [[Old Irish]], also means "peace"), and the fairies are referred to as the ''daoine sìth'' (Irish, ''daoine sídhe'') - the "people of peace". ''Sídhe'', in its variant spellings,  refers to the ''sídhe'' (mounds) where these beings dwell.

The ''bean nighe'' is sometimes known by the [[diminutive]]s ''ban nigheachain'' ("little washerwoman") or ''nigheag na h-àth'' ("little washer at the ford").

'''Bioturbation''' is defined as the reworking of [[soil]]s and [[sediment]]s by animals or plants. These include burrowing, ingestion and defecation of sediment grains. Bioturbating activities have a profound effect on the environment and &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  are thought to be a primary driver of [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The formal study of bioturbation began in the 1800s by [[Charles Darwin]] experimenting in his garden.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The disruption of aquatic sediments and terrestrial soils through bioturbating activities provides significant [[ecosystem services]]. These include the alteration of [[nutrient]]s in aquatic sediment and overlying water, shelter to other species in the form of burrows in terrestrial and water ecosystems, and soil production on land.&lt;ref name="shaler1891"&gt;Shaler, N. S., 1891, The origin and nature of soils, in Powell, J. W., ed., USGS 12th Annual report 1890-1891: Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, p. 213-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

Bioturbators are deemed [[ecosystem engineer]]s because they alter resource availability to other species through the physical changes they make to their environments.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; This type of ecosystem change affects the evolution of cohabitating species and the environment,&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; which is evident in [[trace fossil]]s left in marine and terrestrial sediments. Other bioturbation effects include altering the texture of sediments [[diagenesis|(diagenesis]]), [[bioirrigation]], and displacement of microorganisms and non-living particles. Bioturbation is sometimes confused with the process of bioirrigation, however these processes differ in what they are mixing; bioirrigation refers to the mixing of water and solutes in sediments and is an effect of bioturbation.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== History of the Study of Bioturbation ==
Bioturbation's importance for soil processes and [[geomorphology]] was ﬁrst realized by Charles Darwin, who devoted his last scientific book to the subject (''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]'').&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Darwin spread chalk dust over a field to observe changes in the depth of the chalk layer over time.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Excavations 30 years after the initial deposit of chalk revealed that the chalk was buried 18 centimeters under the sediment, which indicated a burial rate of 6 millimeters per year.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Darwin attributed this burial to the activity of earthworms in the sediment and determined that these disruptions were important in soil formation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Marshall T.|last2=Richards|first2=Paul J.|last3=Humphreys|first3=Geoff S.|date=2009-12-01|title=Breaking ground: Pedological, geological, and ecological implications of soil bioturbation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825209001470|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=97|issue=1|pages=257–272|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.09.005|bibcode=2009ESRv...97..257W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, geologist [[Nathaniel Shaler]] expanded Darwin's concept to include soil disruption by ants and trees.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shaler1891" /&gt; The term "bioturbation" was later coined by Rudolf Richter in 1952 to describe structures in sediment caused by living organisms.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kristensen|first=E|last2=Penha-Lopes|first2=G|last3=Delefosse|first3=M|last4=Valdemarsen|first4=T|last5=Quintana|first5=CO|last6=Banta|first6=GT|date=2012-02-02|title=What is bioturbation?

== Evolution and Ecology ==

=== Evolution  ===
The onset of bioturbation had a profound effect on the environment and the evolution of other organisms.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meysman|first=F|last2=Meddelburg|first2=J|last3=Heip|first3=C|date=|title=Bioturbation: a fresh look at Darwin's last idea|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534706002436|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=21|issue=12|pages=688–695|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.08.002|via=|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbation is thought to have been an important co-factor of the [[Cambrian explosion|Cambrian Explosion]], during which most major animal [[Phylum|phyla]] appeared in the fossil record over a short time.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; [[Predation]] arose during this time and promoted the development of hard skeletons, for example bristles, spines, and shells, as a form of [[armored]] protection.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It is hypothesized that bioturbation resulted from this skeleton formation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  These new hard parts enabled animals to dig into the sediment to seek shelter from predators, which created an incentive for predators to search for prey in the sediment (see [[Evolutionary arms race|Evolutionary Arms Race]]).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Burrowing species fed on buried organic matter in the sediment which resulted in the evolution of deposit feeding (consumption of organic matter within sediment).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Prior to the development of bioturbation, laminated [[microbial mat]]s were the dominant biological structures of the ocean floor and drove much of the [[Ecosystem|ecosystem functions]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; As bioturbation increased, burrowing animals disturbed the microbial mat system and created a mixed sediment layer with greater biological and chemical diversity.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This greater biological and chemical diversity is thought to have led to the evolution and diversification of seafloor-dwelling species.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

An alternate, less widely accepted hypothesis for the origin of bioturbation exists.

* '''Gallery-diffusers''' create complex tube networks within the upper sediment layers and transport sediment through feeding, burrow construction, and general movement throughout their galleries.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47927758|title=Organism-sediment interactions|last=|first=|date=2001|publisher=Published for the Belle W.

*'''Biodiffusers''' transport sediment particles randomly over short distances as they move through sediments.

* '''Regenerators''' are categorized by their ability to release sediment to the overlying water column, which is then dispersed as they burrow.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; After regenerators abandon their burrows, water flow at the sediment surface can push in and collapse the burrow.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Examples of regenerator species include [[Fiddler crab|fiddler]] and [[Ghost crab|ghost]] crabs.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

== Biogeochemical Effects of Bioturbation ==
Since its onset around 541 million years ago, bioturbation has been responsible for changes in ocean chemistry, primarily through nutrient cycling.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=Donald E.|last2=Farquhar|first2=James|date=2009-05-19|title=Animal evolution, bioturbation, and the sulfate concentration of the oceans|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8123|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=20|pages=8123–8127|doi=10.1073/pnas.0902037106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19451639|pmc=2688866|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.8123C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators played, and continue to play, an important role in nutrient transport across sediments.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

For example, bioturbating animals are hypothesized to have affected the cycling of sulfur in the early oceans. According to this hypothesis, bioturbating activities had a large effect on the sulfate concentration in the ocean. Around the Cambrian-Precambrian boundary (541 million years ago), animals begin to mix reduced sulfur from ocean sediments to overlying water causing sulfide to oxidize, which increased the sulfate composition in the ocean. During large extinction events, the sulfate concentration in the ocean was reduced. Although this is difficult to measure directly, seawater sulfur isotope compositions during these times indicates bioturbators influenced the sulfur cycling in the early Earth.

Bioturbators have also altered phosphorus cycling on geologic scales.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dale|first1=A.W|date=2016|title=A model for microbial phosphorus cycling in bioturbated marine sediments: Significance for phosphorus burial in the early Paleozoic|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=189|pages=251–268|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2016.05.046|bibcode=2016GeCoA.189..251D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators mix readily available particulate organic phosphorus (P) deeper into ocean sediment layers which prevents the precipitation of phosphorus [[Mineralization (biology)|(mineralization)]] by increasing the sequestration of phosphorus above normal chemical rates. The sequestration of phosphorus limits oxygen concentrations by decreasing production on a geologic time scale.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; This decrease in production results in an overall decrease in oxygen levels, and it has been proposed that the rise of bioturbation corresponds to a decrease in oxygen levels of that time.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyle|first1=R.A.|date=2014|title=Stabilization of the coupled oxygen and phosphorus cycles by the evolution of bioturbation|volume=7|page=671|doi=10.1038/ngeo2213|journal=Nature Geoscience|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..671B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative feedback of animals sequestering phosphorus in the sediments and subsequently reducing oxygen concentrations in the environment limits the intensity of bioturbation in this early environment.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

Nutrient cycling is still affected by bioturbation in the modern Earth. Some examples in the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are below.

=== Aquatic ===
==== Terrestrial freshwater ecosystems ====
Important sources of bioturbation in freshwater ecosystems include [[Bottom feeder|benthivorous]] (bottom-dwelling) fish, macroinvertebrates such as worms, insect larvae, crustaceans and molluscs, and seasonal influences from [[Fish migration|anadromous]] (migrating) fish such as salmon. Anadromous fish migrate from the sea into fresh-water rivers and streams to spawn. Macroinvertebrates act as biological pumps for moving material between the sediments and water column, feeding on sediment organic matter and transporting mineralized nutrients into the water column.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adámek|first=Zdeněk|last2=Maršálek|first2=Blahoslav|date=2013-02-01|title=Bioturbation of sediments by benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and its implication for pond ecosystems: a review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10499-012-9527-3|journal=Aquaculture International|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1007/s10499-012-9527-3|issn=0967-6120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both benthivorous and anadromous fish can affect ecosystems by decreasing primary production through sediment re-suspension,&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; the subsequent displacement of benthic primary producers, and recycling nutrients from the sediment back into the water column.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsuzaki|first=Shin-ichiro S.|last2=Usio|first2=Nisikawa|last3=Takamura|first3=Noriko|last4=Washitani|first4=Izumi|date=2007-01-01|title=Effects of common carp on nutrient dynamics and littoral community composition: roles of excretion and bioturbation|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/schweiz/fal/2007/00000168/00000001/art00004|journal=Fundamental and Applied Limnology / Archiv f??r Hydrobiologie|volume=168|issue=1|pages=27–38|doi=10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0168-0027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holtgrieve|first=Gordon W.|last2=Schindler|first2=Daniel E.|date=2011-02-01|title=Marine-derived nutrients, bioturbation, and ecosystem metabolism: reconsidering the role of salmon in streams|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/09-1694.1/abstract|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=92|issue=2|pages=373–385|doi=10.1890/09-1694.1|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lakes and ponds ====
[[File:Chironomidae.jpg|thumb|Chironomid larvae.]]
The sediments of lake and pond ecosystems are rich in organic matter, with higher organic matter and nutrient contents in the sediments than in the overlying water.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Nutrient re-regeneration through sediment bioturbation moves nutrients into the water column, thereby enhancing the growth of aquatic plants and phytoplankton ([[primary producers]]).&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The major nutrients of interest in this flux are nitrogen and phosphorus, which often limit the levels of primary production in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Bioturbation increases the flux of mineralized (inorganic) forms of these elements, which can be directly used by primary producers. In addition, bioturbation increases the water column concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus-containing organic matter, which can then be consumed by fauna and mineralized.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Lake and pond sediments often transition from the aerobic (oxygen containing) character of the overlaying water to the anaerobic (without oxygen) conditions of the lower sediment over sediment depths of only a few millimeters, therefore, even bioturbators of modest size can affect this transition of the chemical characteristics of sediments.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; By mixing anaerobic sediments into the water column, bioturbators allow aerobic processes to interact with the re-suspended sediments and the newly exposed bottom sediment surfaces.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Macroinvertebrates including [[Chironomidae|chironomid]] (non-biting midges) larvae and [[Tubifex tubifex|tubificed worms]] (detritus worms) are important agents of bioturbation in these ecosystems and have different effects based on their respective feeding habits. Tubificed worms do not form burrows, they are upward conveyors. Chironomids, on the other hand, form burrows in the sediment, acting as bioirrigators and aerating the sediments and are downward conveyors. This activity, combined with chironomid's respiration within their burrows, decrease available oxygen in the sediment and increase the loss of nitrates through enhanced rates of [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The increased oxygen input to sediments by macroinvertebrate bioirrigation coupled with bioturbation at the sediment-water interface complicates the total flux of phosphorus . While bioturbation results in a net flux of phosphorus into the water column, the bio-irrigation of the sediments with oxygenated water enhances the adsorption of phosphorus onto iron-oxide compounds, thereby reducing the total flux of phosphorus into the water column.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The presence of macroinvertebrates in sediment can initiate bioturbation due to their status as an important food source for benthivorous fish such as [[Common carp|carp]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Of the bioturbating, benthivorous fish species, carp in particular are important ecosystem engineers and their foraging and burrowing activities can alter the water quality characteristics of ponds and lakes.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Carp increase water [[turbidity]] by the re-suspension of benthic sediments. This increased turbidity limits light penetration and coupled with increased nutrient flux from the sediment into the water column, inhibits the growth of macrophytes (aquatic plants) favoring the growth of phytoplankton in the surface waters. Surface phytoplankton colonies benefit from both increased suspended nutrients and from recruitment of buried phytoplankton cells released from the sediments by the fish bioturbation.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Macrophyte growth has also been shown to be inhibited by displacement from the bottom sediments due to fish burrowing.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

==== Rivers and streams ====
River and stream ecosystems show similar responses to bioturbation activities, with chironomid larvae and tubificid worm macroinvertebrates remaining as important benthic agents of bioturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mermillod-Blondin|first=Florian|last2=Gaudet|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Gerino|first3=Magali|last4=Desrosiers|first4=Gaston|last5=Jose|first5=Jacques|last6=Châtelliers|first6=Michel Creuzé des|date=2004-07-01|title=Relative influence of bioturbation and predation on organic matter processing in river sediments: a microcosm experiment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01233.x/abstract|journal=Freshwater Biology|language=en|volume=49|issue=7|pages=895–912|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01233.x|issn=1365-2427}}&lt;/ref&gt; These environments are can also be subject to strong season bioturbation effects from anadromous fish.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Salmon function as bioturbators on both gravel to sand-sized sediment and a nutrient scale, by moving and re-working sediments in the construction of redds (gravel depressions or "nests" containing eggs buried under a thin layer of sediment) in rivers and streams&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gottesfeld|first=AS|last2=Hassan|first2=MA|last3=Tunnicliffe|first3=JF|date=2008|title=Salmon bioturbation and stream process|url=|journal=American Fisheries Society Symposium|volume=65|pages=|via=researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by mobilization of nutrients.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buxton|first=Todd H.|last2=Buffington|first2=John M.|last3=Tonina|first3=Daniele|last4=Fremier|first4=Alexander K.|last5=Yager|first5=Elowyn M.|date=2015-04-13|title=Modeling the influence of salmon spawning on hyporheic exchange of marine-derived nutrients in gravel stream beds|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0413|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=72|issue=8|pages=1146–1158|doi=10.1139/cjfas-2014-0413|issn=0706-652X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of salmon redds functions to increase the ease of fluid movement ([[hydraulic conductivity]]) and porosity of the stream bed.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In select rivers, if salmon congregate in large enough concentrations in a given area of the river, the total sediment transport from redd construction can equal or exceed the sediment transport from flood events.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The net effect on sediment movement is the downstream transfer of gravel, sand and finer materials and enhancement of water mixing within the river substrate.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The construction of salmon redds increases sediment and nutrient fluxes through the [[hyporheic zone]] (area between surface water and groundwater) of rivers and effects the dispersion and retention of marine derived nutrients (MDN) within the river ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; MDN are delivered to river and stream ecosystems by the fecal matter of spawning salmon and the decaying carcasses of salmon that have completed spawning and died.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Numerical modeling suggests that residence time of MDN within a salmon spawning reach is inversely proportional to the amount of redd construction within the river.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Measurements of respiration within a salmon-bearing river in Alaska further suggest that salmon bioturbation of the river bed plays a significant role in mobilizing MDN and limiting primary productivity while salmon spawning is active.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The river ecosystem was found to switch from a net [[autotroph]]ic to [[heterotroph]]ic system in response to decreased primary production and increased respiration.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The decreased primary production in this study was attributed to the loss of benthic primary producers who were dislodged due to bioturbation, while increased respiration was thought to be due to increased respiration of organic carbon, also attributed to sediment mobilization from salmon redd construction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While marine derived nutrients are generally thought to increase productivity in riparian and freshwater ecosystems, several studies have suggested that temporal effects of bioturbation should be considered when characterizing salmon influences on nutrient cycles.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Marine environments ====
Major marine bioturbators range from small [[Sediment-dwelling organism|infaunal]] invertebrates to fish and marine mammals.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In most marine sediments, however, they are dominated by small invertebrates, including polychaetes, bivalves, burrowing shrimp, and amphipods.

===== Shallow and Coastal =====
Coastal ecosystems, such as estuaries, are generally highly productive, which results in the accumulation of large quantities of [[detritus]] (organic waste). These large quantities, in addition to typically small sediment grain size and dense populations, make bioturbators important in estuarine respiration.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/798834896|title=Interactions between macro- and microorganisms in marine sediments|date=2005|publisher=American Geophysical Union|others=American Geophysical Union.|isbn=9781118665442|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=798834896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators enhance the transport of oxygen into sediments through irrigation and increase the surface area of oxygenated sediments through burrow construction.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; Bioturbators also transport organic matter deeper into sediments through general reworking activities and production of fecal matter.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; This ability to replenish oxygen and other solutes at sediment depth allows for enhanced respiration by both bioturbators as well as the microbial community, thus altering estuarine elemental cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nitrogen Cycling in Coastal Marine Environments|last=Aller|first=Robert C.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=1988|isbn=|editor-last=Blackburn|editor-first=T.H.|location=|pages=301–338|chapter=13.

Bioturbation is important in the deep sea because deep-sea ecosystem functioning depends on the use and recycling of nutrients and organic inputs from the [[photic zone]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danovaro|first=Roberto|last2=Gambi|first2=Cristina|last3=Dell'Anno|first3=Antonio|last4=Corinaldesi|first4=Cinzia|last5=Fraschetti|first5=Simonetta|last6=Vanreusel|first6=Ann|last7=Vincx|first7=Magda|last8=Gooday|first8=Andrew J.|title=Exponential Decline of Deep-Sea Ecosystem Functioning Linked to Benthic Biodiversity Loss|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982207023421|journal=Current Biology|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.11.056|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morys|first=C|last2=Forster|first2=S|last3=Graf|first3=G|date=2016-09-28|title=Variability of bioturbation in various sediment types and on different spatial scales in the southwestern Baltic Sea|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v557/p31-49/|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|language=en|volume=557|pages=31–49|doi=10.3354/meps11837|issn=0171-8630|bibcode=2016MEPS..557...31M}}&lt;/ref&gt; In low energy regions (areas with relatively still water), bioturbation is the only force creating [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneity]] in solute concentration and mineral distribution in the sediment.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aller|first=Robert C.|last2=Hall|first2=Per O.J.|last3=Rude|first3=Peter D.|last4=Aller|first4=J.Y.|title=Biogeochemical heterogeneity and suboxic diagenesis in hemipelagic sediments of the Panama Basin|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0967063797000496|journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers|volume=45|issue=1|pages=133–165|doi=10.1016/s0967-0637(97)00049-6|year=1998|bibcode=1998DSRI...45..133A}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that higher benthic diversity in the deep sea could lead to more bioturbation which, in turn, would increase the transport of organic matter and nutrients to benthic sediments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Through the consumption of surface-derived organic matter, animals living on the sediment surface facilitate the incorporation of particulate organic carbon (POC) into the sediment where it is consumed by sediment dwelling animals and bacteria.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vardaro|first=Michael F.|last2=Ruhl|first2=Henry A.|last3=Smith|first3=Kenneth Jr. L.|date=2009-11-01|title=Climate variation, carbon flux, and bioturbation in the abyssal North Pacific|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.2009.54.6.2081/abstract|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=2081–2088|doi=10.4319/lo.2009.54.6.2081|issn=1939-5590|bibcode=2009LimOc..54.2081V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Craig R.|last2=Berelson|first2=Will|last3=Demaster|first3=David J.|last4=Dobbs|first4=Fred C.|last5=Hammond|first5=Doug|last6=Hoover|first6=Daniel J.|last7=Pope|first7=Robert H.|last8=Stephens|first8=Mark|title=Latitudinal variations in benthic processes in the abyssal equatorial Pacific: control by biogenic particle flux|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0967064597000222|journal=Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography|volume=44|issue=9–10|pages=2295–2317|doi=10.1016/s0967-0645(97)00022-2|year=1997|bibcode=1997DSRII..44.2295S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporation of POC into the food webs of sediment dwelling animals promotes carbon sequestration by removing carbon from the water column and burying it in the sediment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In some deep-sea sediments, intense bioturbation enhances manganese and nitrogen cycling.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Terrestrial ===
[[File:Camas pocket gopher mounds.JPG|thumb|Pocket gopher mounds |256x256px]]
Plants and animals utilize soil for food and shelter, disturbing the upper soil layers and transporting chemically weathered rock called [[saprolite]] from the lower soil depths to the surface.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Terrestrial bioturbation is important in soil production, burial, organic matter content, and downslope transport. Tree roots are sources of [[soil organic matter]], with root growth and stump decay also contributing to soil transport and mixing.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Death and decay of tree roots first delivers organic matter to the soil and then creates voids, decreasing soil density. Tree uprooting causes considerable soil displacement by producing mounds, mixing the soil, or inverting [[Soil profile|vertical sections of soil.]]&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Burrowing animals, such as earth worms and small mammals form passageways for air and water transport which changes the soil properties, such as the vertical particle-size distribution, soil [[porosity]], and nutrient content.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Invertebrates that burrow and consume plant detritus help produce an organic-rich topsoil known as the [[soil biomantle]], and thus contribute to the formation of [[Soil horizon|soil horizons.]]&lt;ref name="shaler1891" /&gt; Small mammals such as [[pocket gophers]] also play an important role in the production of soil, possibly with an equal magnitude to abiotic processes.&lt;ref name=":38"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichman|first=O.J.|last2=Seabloom|first2=Eric W.|title=The role of pocket gophers as subterranean ecosystem engineers|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534701023291|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=17|issue=1|pages=44–49|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02329-1|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocket gophers form above-ground mounds, which moves soil from the lower soil horizons to the surface, exposing minimally weathered rock to surface erosion processes, speeding soil formation.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Pocket gophers are thought to play an important role in the downslope transport of soil, as the soil that forms their mounds is more susceptible to erosion and subsequent transport. Similar to tree root effects, the construction of burrows-even when backfilled- decreases soil density.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; The formation of surface mounds also buries surface vegetation, creating nutrient hotspots when the vegetation decomposes, increasing soil organic matter. Due to the high metabolic demands of their burrow-excavating subterranean lifestyle, pocket gophers must consume large amounts of plant material.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; Though this has a detrimental effect on individual plants, the net effect of pocket gophers is increased plant growth from their positive effects on soil nutrient content and physical soil properties.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt;

== In the fossil record ==
[[File:Planolites.jpg|thumb|Planolite fossil]]

=== In the sediment record ===
Patterns or traces of bioturbation are preserved in [[Lithification|lithified]] rock. The study of such patterns is called [[ichnology]], or the study of "trace fossils", which, in the case of bioturbators, are fossils left behind by digging or burrowing animals. This can be compared to the footprint left behind by these animals. In some cases bioturbation is so pervasive that it completely obliterates [[sedimentary structures]], such as laminated layers or [[cross-bedding]]. Thus, it affects the disciplines of [[sedimentology]] and [[stratigraphy]] within geology. The study of bioturbator ichnofabrics uses the depth of the fossils, the cross-cutting of fossils, and the sharpness (or how well defined) of the fossil&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=A. M.|last2=Goldring|first2=R.|date=|title=Description and analysis of bioturbation and ichnofabric|url=https://doi.org/10.1144/gsjgs.150.1.0141|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|volume=150|issue=1|pages=141–148|doi=10.1144/gsjgs.150.1.0141|via=|year=1993|bibcode=1993JGSoc.150..141T}}&lt;/ref&gt; to assess the activity that occurred in old sediments. Typically the deeper the fossil, the better preserved and well defined the specimen.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Important [[trace fossil]]s from bioturbation have been found in marine sediments from tidal, coastal and deep sea sediments. In addition sand dune, or [[Eolian dust|Eolian]], sediments are important for preserving a wide variety of fossils.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; Evidence of bioturbation has been found in deep-sea sediment cores including into long records, although the act extracting the core can disturb the signs of bioturbation, especially at shallower depths.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hertweck|first1=G|last2=Liebezeit|first2=G|title=Bioturbation structures of polychaetes in modern shallow marine environments and their analogues to Chondrites group traces|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=2007|volume=245|issue=3|pages=382–389|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthropods, in particular are important to the geologic record of bioturbation of Eolian sediments.

== Mathematical Models ==
The role of bioturbators in sediment biogeochemistry makes bioturbation a common parameter in sediment biogeochemical models, which are often [[Numerical modeling (geology)|numerical models]] built using [[Ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851842693|title=Diagenetic Models and Their Implementation : Modelling Transport and Reactions in Aquatic Sediments|last=P.|first=Boudreau, Bernard|date=1997|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=364264399X|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|oclc=851842693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbation is typically represented as D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, or the biodiffusion coefficient, and is described by a [[Diffusion equation|diffusion]] and, sometimes, an [[Advective derivative|advective]] term.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt; This representation and subsequent variations account for the different modes of mixing by functional groups and bioirrigation that results from them.

Parameterization of bioturbation, however, can vary, as newer and more complex models can be used to fit tracer profiles.

The '''Burnham Plan''' is a popular name for the 1909 '''''Plan of Chicago''''',  co-authored by [[Daniel Burnham]] and [[Edward H. Bennett]].   It recommended an integrated series of projects including new and widened streets, parks, new railroad and harbor facilities, and civic buildings. Though only portions of the plan were realized, the document reshaped Chicago's central area and was an important influence on the new field of [[city planning]].

The project was begun in 1906 by the [[Merchants Club]], which merged with the [[Commercial Club of Chicago]], a group of prominent businessmen who recognized the necessity of improvements to the fast-growing city. They retained Daniel H. Burnham, an architect who had managed the construction of the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago.  After the fair, he had presented ideas for improving Chicago's lakefront, and had worked on city plans for [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Cleveland]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Manila]] and [[Baguio]] in the [[Philippines]].  Burnham retained [[Edward H. Bennett|Edward Bennett]] as co-author, and a small staff to help prepare the plan.  [[Charles Moore (city planner)|Charles Moore]] edited the finished manuscript, and renderer Jules Guérin created several birds-eye views for the full-color document, which was printed in lavish book form and presented to the city in July 1909.

==Aspects of the plan==
[[File:Burnham 1909 chicago plan.jpg|thumb|250px|Plan of central Chicago]]
[[File:BurnhamPlanOfChicago-CivicCenterPlaza-JulesGuerin.jpg|thumb|250px|right|View, looking west, of the proposed Civic Center]]

The Burnham Plan focused on 6 major elements:

===Improvement of the lakefront===
Foremost among the plan's goals was reclaiming the lakefront for the public. "The Lakefront by right belongs to the people," wrote Burnham. "Not a foot of its shores should be appropriated to the exclusion of the people." The plan recommended expanding the parks along the Lake Michigan shoreline with landfill, which was done in the early 20th century. Of the city's 29 miles (47&amp;nbsp;km) of lakefront, all but four miles (six kilometres) are today public parkland. The plan also provided for extensive lakefront harbour facilities, which became unnecessary with the city's development of facilities in the Lake Calumet regions.

===A regional highway system===
The plan considered Chicago as the centre of a region extending 75 miles (120&amp;nbsp;km) from the city centre. At the dawn of the automobile age, the plan diagrammed both radial and circumferential highways for the region. However, the agencies who built and improved highways in the 1910s and 1920s do not appear to have been guided to build along the specific routes recommended in the plan.

===Improvement of railway terminals===
The plan drew on technical studies previously done by others, including a plan for competing railroads to pool usage of tracks for greater efficiency in freight handling. In addition, the plan detailed the consolidation of Chicago's six intercity railroad passenger terminals into new complexes west of the Loop and south of [[Roosevelt Road]]. This, in turn, would allow the expansion of the business district southward. A new Chicago Union Station was finished in 1925, but no other stations were consolidated or relocated. In 1929, the South Branch of the [[Chicago River]] was rechanneled, between Polk and 18th Streets, to untangle railroad approaches as recommended by the plan.

===New outer parks===
The movement to purchase and preserve the natural areas that became the Cook County Forest Preserves was well under way as the plan was being written. The plan includes those proposals and also calls for the expansion of the city's park and boulevard system, which had been first established in the 1870s.

===Systematic arrangement of streets===
New wider arterials were prescribed to relieve traffic congestion and beautify the fast growing city, including a network of new diagonal streets. One of these diagonals was constructed: the extension of [[Ogden Avenue]] and there are several other diagonal streets throughout the city. Many of the plan's street recommendations were followed. The city renovated, widened, and extended [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], widened [[Roosevelt Road]], and created [[Wacker Drive]] and [[Congress Parkway]]. With the growth in automobile usage after [[World War I]], Chicago planners began to drastically alter or step away from Burnham's proposals for the street system.&lt;ref&gt;Wide Boulevards, Narrow Visions: Burnham's Street System and the [[Chicago Plan Commission]], 1909–1930. ''Journal of Planning History,'' 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 108 miles (174&amp;nbsp;km) of arterial streets were widened between 1915 and 1931, spurred by the tremendous growth in automobile usage. Writing in 1908, Burnham saw the automobile as a recreational vehicle that would allow city dwellers to visit the countryside; he did not foresee how it would overwhelm and transform the city itself.

===Civic and cultural centers===
The most iconic image of the plan was the new civic center proposed for the area around Congress and Halsted Streets. However, city officials who preferred the convenience of a Loop location never seriously pursued the proposal. At the east end of Congress Street, which would become the central axis of the reshaped city, Burnham proposed a cultural center in [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] consisting of the new [[Field Museum of Natural History]] and new homes for the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and the [[Crerar Library]]. This proposal, however, placed Burnham and other civic leaders in conflict with a state supreme court decision forbidding any new buildings in Grant Park.

==Implementation==
Although Burnham died in 1912, the ''Plan of Chicago'' was promoted by Commercial Club members and the [[Chicago Plan Commission]]. They persuaded the [[mayor of Chicago]] to appoint co-author [[Edward H. Bennett]], a graduate of the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], and he advised various public agencies as they constructed the projects recommended by the plan, using a design vocabulary reminiscent of 19th century [[Paris]]. Mayor [[William Hale Thompson]], elected in 1915, used ''Plan of Chicago'' projects to promote his image as a Chicago booster, and as a rich source of public contracts.

The plan has been criticized for its focus on physical improvements, an attempt to create "Paris on the Prairie." Burnham's handwritten draft of the plan contained extensive discussion of social needs, but the final publication does not.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, Kristin. Introduction to ''Plan of Chicago'' (reprint), Princeton Architectural Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan's list of big infrastructure improvements were badly needed by a rapidly growing city, at a time when an expanding tax base made it possible to undertake large projects.

Enthusiasm for the Burnham Plan's specific proposals faded with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], but aspects of the plan continued to guide planners as they expanded parks, built new bridges, and laid out the city's superhighway network. Civic leaders still make frequent reference to Burnham's vision for the city, and to an aphorism posthumously attributed to him, the oft-quoted exhortation to "make no little plans."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1735">'''Cel''' was the [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan goddess]] of the [[earth]]. On the Etruscan calendar, the month of ''Celi'' (September) is likely named for her.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Thomson De Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2006), p. 43, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[Interpretatio graeca|Greek counterpart]] is [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and her [[List of Roman deities|Roman]] is [[Terra (goddess)|Tellus]].

In [[Etruscan mythology]], Cel was the mother of the [[Gigantes|Giants]]. A [[bronze mirror]] from the 5th century BC depicts a [[theomachy]] in which '''Celsclan''', "son of Cel," is a Giant attacked by [[Laran]], the god of war. In Greek, "giant" comes from a word meaning "born from Gaia".&lt;ref&gt;De Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Another mirror depicts [[anguiped]] Giants in the company of a goddess, possibly Cel, whose lower body is formed of [[vegetation]].&lt;ref&gt;De Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth'', p. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sanctuary near [[Lake Trasimeno]] were found five [[votive]] bronze statuettes, some male and some female, dedicated to her as ''Cel Ati'', "Mother Cel".  The inscription on each reads ''mi celś atial celthi,'' "I [belong to, have been given] to Cel the mother, here [in this sanctuary]."&lt;ref&gt;Giuliano Bonfante and [[Larissa Bonfante]], ''The Etruscan Language: An Introduction'' (New York University Press, 2002, revised edition), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cel appears on the [[Liver of Piacenza]], a bronze model of a liver marked for the Etruscan practice of [[haruspicy]]. She is placed in House 13.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1118">'''Convergence''' in [[sustainability science]]s refers to mechanisms and pathways that lead towards [[sustainability]] with a specific focus on 'Equity within biological planetary limits'. These pathways and mechanisms explicitly advocate equity and recognise the need for redistribution of the Earth's resources in order for human society to operate enduringly within the Earth's biophysical limits.

This use of the term 'convergence' harkens from the concept of [[contraction and convergence]] (C&amp;C), taking its core principles of Equity and Survival and applying them beyond the frame of [[greenhouse gas emissions]] to the wider sustainability agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fortnam|first=Matt|title=Convergence:   How can it be a part of the   pathway to sustainability?|url=http://www.convergeproject.org/node/51|publisher=The CONVERGE project website|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9343">'''Dissipative particle dynamics''' ('''DPD''') is a stochastic simulation technique for simulating the dynamic and rheological properties of simple and complex fluids. It was initially devised by Hoogerbrugge and Koelman&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Hoogerbrugge and J. M. V. A. Koelman. Simulating microscopic hydrodynamic phenomena with dissipative particle dynamics. Europhysics Letters, 19(3):155–160, JUN 1 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. M. V. A. Koelman and P. J. Hoogerbrugge. Dynamic simulations of hard-sphere suspensions under steady shear. Europhysics Letters, 21(3):363–368, JAN 20 1993&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid the lattice artifacts of the so-called [[Cellular automaton|lattice gas automata]] and to tackle hydrodynamic time and space scales beyond those available with [[molecular dynamics]] (MD). It was subsequently reformulated and slightly modified by [[P. Español]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Español and P. B. Warren. Statistical-mechanics of dissipative particle dynamics. Europhysics Letters, 30(4):191–196, MAY 1 1995&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure the proper thermal equilibrium state. A series of new DPD algorithms with reduced computational complexity and better control of transport properties are presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ct3000876 N. Goga, A.J. Rzepiela, A.H. de Vries, S.J. Marrink, H.J.C. Berendsen: Efficient algorithms for Langevin and DPD dynamics, J. Chem. Th. Comp., 2012, DOI:10.1021/ct3000876]&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithms presented in this article choose randomly a pair particle for applying DPD thermostating thus reducing the computational complexity.

DPD is an off-lattice mesoscopic simulation technique which involves a set of particles moving in continuous space and discrete time. Particles represent whole molecules or fluid regions, rather than single atoms, and atomistic details are not considered relevant to the processes addressed. The particles' internal degrees of freedom are integrated out and replaced by simplified pairwise dissipative and random forces, so as to conserve momentum locally and ensure correct hydrodynamic behaviour. The main advantage of this method is that it gives access to longer time and length scales than are possible using conventional MD simulations. Simulations of polymeric fluids in volumes up to 100&amp;nbsp;nm in linear dimension for tens of microseconds are now common.

==Equations==
The total non-bonded force acting on a DPD particle ''i'' is given by a sum over all particles ''j'' that lie within a fixed cut-off distance, of three pairwise-additive forces:

: &lt;math&gt; f_i =\sum_{j \ne i}(F^C_{ij} + F^D_{ij} + F^R_{ij}) &lt;/math&gt;

where the first term in the above equation is a conservative force, the second a
dissipative force and the third a random force. The conservative force acts to give beads a chemical identity, while the dissipative and random forces together form a thermostat that keeps the mean temperature of the system constant. A key property of all of the non-bonded forces is that they conserve momentum locally, so that hydrodynamic modes of the fluid emerge even for small particle numbers. Local momentum conservation requires that the random force between two interacting beads be antisymmetric. Each pair of interacting particles therefore requires only a single random force calculation. This distinguishes DPD from [[Brownian dynamics]] in which each particle experiences a random force independently of all other particles.  Beads can be connected into ‘molecules’ by tying them together with soft (often Hookean) springs.    The most common applications of DPD keep the [[particle number]], volume and temperature constant, and so take place in the NVT ensemble. Alternatively, the pressure instead of the volume is held constant, so that the simulation is in the NPT ensemble.

==Parallelization==
In principle, simulations of very large systems, approaching a cubic micron for milliseconds, are possible using a parallel implementation of DPD running on multiple processors in a [[Beowulf cluster|Beowulf]]-style cluster. Because the non-bonded forces are short-ranged in DPD, it is possible to parallelize a DPD code very efficiently using a spatial domain decomposition technique. In this scheme, the total simulation space is divided into a number of cuboidal regions each of which is assigned to a distinct processor in the cluster. Each processor is responsible for integrating the equations of motion of all beads whose centres of mass lie within its region of space. Only beads lying near the boundaries of each processor's space require communication between processors. In order to ensure that the simulation is efficient, the crucial requirement is that the number of particle-particle interactions that require inter-processor communication be much smaller than the number of particle-particle interactions within the bulk of each processor's region of space. Roughly speaking, this means that the volume of space assigned to each processor should be sufficiently large that its surface area (multiplied by a distance comparable to the force cut-off distance) is much less than its volume.

== Applications ==
A wide variety of complex hydrodynamic phenomena have been simulated using DPD, the list here is necessarily incomplete. The goal of these simulations often is to relate the macroscopic [[Non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian]] flow properties of the fluid to its microscopic structure. Such DPD applications range from modelling the rheological properties of concrete&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.nist.gov/mcsd/savg/parallel/dpd/#id1063308 James S. Sims and Nicos S. Martys: Modelling the Rheological Properties of Concrete]&lt;/ref&gt; to simulating liposome formation in biophysics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lce.hut.fi/research/polymer/dpd.shtml Petri Nikunen, Mikko Karttunen, and Ilpo Vattulainen: Modelling Liposome formation in biophysics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070722102732/http://www.lce.hut.fi/research/polymer/dpd.shtml |date=July 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to other recent three-phase phenomena such as dynamic wetting.&lt;ref&gt;B. Henrich, C. Cupelli, M. Moseler, and M. Santer": An adhesive DPD wall model for dynamic wetting, Europhysics Letters 80 (2007) 60004, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further reading==
The full trace of the developments of various important aspects of the DPD methodology since it was first proposed in the early 1990s can be found in "Dissipative Particle Dynamics: Introduction, Methodology and Complex Fluid Applications – A Review".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moeendarbary |display-authors=etal |year=2009|title=Dissipative Particle Dynamics: Introduction, Methodology and Complex Fluid Applications - A Review|journal=International Journal of Applied Mechanics|publisher=World Scientific Journals|volume=1|subscription=yes |issue=4|pages=737–763|url=http://www.worldscinet.com/ijam/01/0104/S1758825109000381.html|doi=10.1142/S1758825109000381|bibcode = 2009IJAM...01..737M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state-of-the-art in DPD was captured in a [[CECAM]] workshop in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cecam.org/workshop-0-188.html Dissipative Particle Dynamics: Addressing deficiencies and establishing new frontiers], CECAM workshop, July 16–18, 2008, Lausanne, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations to the technique presented there include DPD with energy conservation; non-central frictional forces that allow the fluid viscosity to be tuned; an algorithm for preventing bond crossing between polymers; and the automated calibration of DPD interaction parameters from atomistic [[molecular dynamics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">The End Use Energy Demand (EUED) Centres carry out interdisciplinary research and advise policy on reducing [[energy demand]] to help achieve the [[Energy in the United Kingdom|UK government's CO2 emissions targets]]. The Centres are a £30m investment of the [[Research Councils]] UK Energy Programme (with additional funding from industrial partners) that run from 2013-2018. The six large centres are based across 25 institutions and encompass over 200 researchers.

== The Centres ==
The Centres are:

'''Centre for Energy Epidemiology (CEE) -''' Based at [[University College London]] and directed by Professor [[Tadj Oreszczyn]].

'''Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand (CIED) -''' Based at the [[University of Sussex]] and directed by Professor [[Benjamin Sovacool]].

'''Centre for Industrial Energy, Materials and Products (CIE-MAP) -''' Based at the [[University of Leeds]] and directed by Professor [[Professor John Barrett|John Barrett]].

'''Centre for Sustainable Energy Use in Food Chains (CSEF) -''' Based at [[Brunel University]] and led by Professor Savvas Tassou.

'''Dynamics of Energy, Mobility and Demand (DEMAND) -''' Based at the [[University of Lancaster]] and led by Professor [[Elizabeth Shove]].

'''Interdisciplinary Centre for Storage, Transformation and Upgrading of Thermal Energy (i-STUTE) -''' Based at the [[University of Warwick]] and directed by Professor [[Robert Critoph]].

== Background ==
The [[UK]] is committed to achieving large-scale reductions (80%) in [[greenhouse gas emissions]] by 2050 ([[Climate Change Act]] (1990)). End Use Energy Demand (EUED) research is about reducing energy use on the scale needed to reach this target, whilst maintaining current or achieving better standards of living and economic growth. The EUED Centres were funded in 2013 following a 2011 call for proposals from the Research Councils UK Energy Programme to address these issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28790">'''Energy policy of Finland''' describes the [[politics of Finland]] related to energy. [[Energy in Finland]] describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and import in [[Finland]]. [[Electricity sector in Finland]] is the main article of electricity in Finland.

==Climate policy==
Finland is member of the EU. EU sets the minimum climate policy targets for Finland.

According to Mr. Heikki Simola Finnish Association of Nature Conservation Finnish forest management has made Finnish forest and mire ecosystems as a considerable net source of carbon into the atmosphere for decades.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.slideshare.net/ExternalEvents/alarming-loss-of-soil-carbon-stores-in-the-boreal-forest-zone-in-finland%20 Alarming loss of soil carbon un the Boreal forest zone in Finland] Heikki Simola Finnish Association of Nature Conservation November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electricity==
{{See also| Electricity sector in Finland}}
The annual net import of electricity has varied between 5-20% of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Energy year book 2006, Statistic 3.1, Statistics of Finland&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lighting===
In the EU politics Finnish government supported the delay in the banning of the incandescent lightbulbs.

According to the national state owned energy center Motiva banning of incandescent lightbulbs will save 5.8% of households electricity (1.1 TWh) in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Lamput vaihtoon, [[Satu Hassi]], TEK 4/2007 (Ms. S. Hassi supported [[Phase-out of incandescent light bulbs|the banning of the incandescent lightbulbs]] based on [[energy saving]] in 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The lightbulbs banning is not restricted in households but concern also other sectors lighting, like industry, service, agriculture and public lighting, making the total national percentage lower and total energy savings higher than the above given numbers 5.8% of electricity 1.1 TWh. Motiva calculation may have used average year consumption instead of the specific year e.g. 2006. According to the statistics of Finland, in 2006 the electricity used in households was 10.6 TWh excluding the electricity warming that was 9.1 TWh. Thus 1.1/19.7 would be ca 5.6% in 2006. Excluding electric warming it would be 10.4% of household electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics of Finland, Annual book Energy 2007, Helsinki 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear power ===
{{See also| Nuclear power in Finland}}

In the 1980s the nuclear accident costs for the nuclear plant in Finland were limited to 1.6 mrd [[Finnish markka|markka]] (0.26 mrd €).&lt;ref&gt;Jarmo Vehmas, Suomen energiatalouden ekologinen modernisaatio, page 170, In: Ilmo Massa and Ossi Rahkonen, Riskiyhteiskunnan talous, Suomen ekologinen modernisaatio, Gaudeamus 1995 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated cost of [[Chernobyl disaster]] 1986 is hundreds of bn dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/raw/content/international/press/reports/nuclear-power-is-not-the-answe.pdf Nuclear power is not the answer to climate change The Imperative for an Energy Revolution]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Greenpeace 5.12.2007&lt;/ref&gt; Also the EU has kept supporting Russia in the expenses of the Tšernobyl disaster still in 2010. The general environmental policy of EU is that the polluter pays. This does not apply the external costs of nuclear power that are in Finland diluted to all national tax payers and in the case of nuclear disaster probably further to all tax payers of the European Union.

Greenpeace calculated in 2009 that any additional nuclear energy would be for electricity import not for domestic use since the electricity demand will decline from the year 2020.&lt;ref name="greenpeace.org"&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/finland/fi/dokumentit/miksiEiYdinvoimaa.pdf Miksi Suomeen ei kannata rakentaa lisää ydinvoimaa?] Greenpeace 5.6.2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate and energy]] strategy 2008 did not give the reduction of CO2 emissions in 1990-2020. After environmental committee inquiry the target was told to be 5%. Only 10% of the Finnish climate emissions are from electricity. According to [[Pöyry]] Energy (2008) addition of nuclear energy would reduce Finnish climate emissions 4% (2,8 Mt) and majority of the electricity would be for export. In addition, the major nuclear companies [[Fortum]] and [[Pohjolan Voima|PVO]] plan new coal companies.&lt;ref name="greenpeace.org"/&gt;

===Transmission===

[[Fingrid]] Oyj is a Finnish national [[Electrical grid|electricity transmission grid]] operator. In Finland the electricity transmission costs were informed in September 2010 to rise for everybody in 2012 at least 10% based on the needed transmission line investments demanded by the new Olkiluoto nuclear plant under construction in 2005-2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi//uutiset/talous_ja_politiikka/2010/09/fingrid_aikoo_nostaa_kantaverkkomaksuja_1946795.html Fingrid aikoo nostaa kantaverkkomaksuja] Yle 01.09.2010&lt;/ref&gt; The transmission lines are owned by [[Fingrid]]. The nuclear companies [[Fortum]] and [[Pohjolan Voima|PVO]] were 50% shareholders of Fingrid. Both of them are shareholders of the nuclear power plant under construction in 2005-2013. According to the EU decisions the power companies should not own the grid. Representative of the social democrat party supported in 2008 the 100% state ownership and control of Fingrid including acquisitions from the nuclear and insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/talous_ja_politiikka/2011/01/valtio_kantaverkkoyhtio_fingridin_enemmistoomistajaksi_2317494.html Skinnari haluaa Fingridin kokonaan valtiolle] Yle 01.03.2008&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish state and the insurance company Ilmarinen will take over a 50% share of Fingrid from the nuclear companies [[Fortum]] and [[Pohjolan Voima|PVO]] as announced in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/talous_ja_politiikka/2011/01/valtio_kantaverkkoyhtio_fingridin_enemmistoomistajaksi_2317494.html Valtio kantaverkkoyhtiö Fingridin enemmistöomistajaksi] yle 26.1.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electricity costs===
The industry electricity tariffs are lower than other users. In Finland the electricity pricing of households promotes electricity use with high fixed prices and increasing price reductions for higher consumption. The annual transmission costs for at least a moderate energy user (less than 2 MWh a year, a typical German consumption) can be higher than the actual electricity cost. With this consumption level the fixed costs may be around 0.25-0.3 % of total electricity costs. According to the newspaper discussions in some contracts the fixed cost can be substantial also when there is no electricity use and the power lines are old. The fixed costs may be a significant cost factor in the evaluation of own renewable electricity production. This applies also alternatives to fossil heating if connection to old system is in place. Most often only the remote summer cottages have no connection in the transmission power lines with annual fixed costs. At least until the end of 2010 there was no compensation of extra electricity fed in the power lines. This is also valid in 2011 for small scale domestic or agricultural farm production. The electricity feed in policy of government have mainly supported the large energy companies economical interests. The shift in the charge of electricity consumption instead of the present trend to increase of the fixed prices would promote economically the energy savings and renewable energy investments. This could be politically controlled since the business interest is to  promote high energy consumption.

== Energy security and domestic energy==
[[Energy security]] measures center on reducing dependence on any one source of imported energy or supplier, exploiting [[renewable energy]] resources, and reducing demand by [[energy conservation]]. Finland is highly dependent on energy import from Russia: 71% of total energy in 2007: Hard coal 92%, raw oil 75% and natural gas 100%.&lt;ref&gt;Energian tuonti alkuperämaittain vuonna 2007 Statistic of Finland 20.3.2008&lt;/ref&gt; The support of domestic energy has been mainly based on traditional bioenergy and highly disputed fossil [[Peat energy in Finland|peat energy]] alternatives.  The new renewable energy alternatives have not been effectively promoted by the end of 2010. This strategy was criticised by the IEA in its country evaluation in 2007. According to the renewable energy statistics of EU countries Finland has low capacities of [[Wind power in the European Union|wind power]] (19/27), [[Solar power in the European Union|solar power]] (17/27) and [[Solar power in the European Union|solar heating]] (23/27) in 2010. Wind power is repeatedly the most favoured power source in Finland with over 90% of support according to the public opinion tests. In this respect the official energy policy of Finland has promoted the market control of traditional energy sources and companies.

== Renewable energy==
{{See also| Renewable energy in Finland}}

Renewable energy target of electricity was 35% in 2005 from 1997 to 2010. In 2006 the target was dropped in 31.5% from 1997 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf  2005: Record year for investments in renewable energy REN21] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318230432/http://www.ren21.net/pdf/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf |date=2009-03-18 }} Renewables Global Status Report 2006 Update”, REN21 (Paris) and Worldwatch institute (Washington, DC), 18.7.2006, picture 10&lt;/ref&gt; The RE electricity share was about the same in 1997 as in 2009. Since the consumption of electricity increased, the use of fossil fuel electricity increased as well. Since the energy statistics of Finland have rather high annual variations, for more accurate energy trend evaluations one may want to calculate also e.g. five year averages.

=== Hydro electricity ===

Most [[Hydroelectric power plants in Finland|hydroelectricity]] capacity was built before year 1997. [[Fortum]] owns the majority of water power. Fortum received most of its hydroelectricity power capacity in the disputed acquisition of the same size national company and mainly renewable electricity company Imatran Voima. Fortum was until then mainly a nuclear company. Finnish competition authorities approved the deal.

===Wind power===
{{See also| Wind power in Finland}}

The wind power target of Finland was 494&amp;nbsp;MW wind power by 2010.&lt;ref name=KTL2003&gt;[Uusiutuvien energialähteiden edistämisohjelman arviointi] Kauppa- ja teollisuusministeriö, editor Pentti Leino, Electrowatt-Ekono Oy, 19.02.2003 page 40&lt;/ref&gt; Only 40%, 197&amp;nbsp;MW of the target, was achieved in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ewea.org/fileadmin/ewea_documents/documents/statistics/EWEA_Annual_Statistics_2010.pdf EWEA Annual statistics 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar energy ===

====Solar heating ====
[[Solar heating]] is the usage of solar energy to provide space or [[water heating]]. Solar heating per capita in Finland was among the lowest in the EU in 2010, with high unused domestic energy opportunities (W/capita): Finland 4, Latvia 3, [[Energy in Estonia|Estonia]] 1 and Lithuania 1. Corresponding capacity was in other Scandinavian countries [[Renewable energy in Denmark|Denmark]] 68 and [[Renewable energy in Sweden|Sweden]] 33.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurobserv-er.org/pdf/baro202.asp Photovoltaic energy barometer 2011 – EurObserv’ER]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1995–2010 Finland’s target was 50&amp;nbsp;GWh solar heating &lt;ref name="KTL2003"/&gt; According to ESTIF estimation in end 2010 solar heating capacity was 23 MW in Finland, 379&amp;nbsp;MW in Denmark and 312&amp;nbsp;MW in Sweden. During 2010, the European solar heating yield was 17.3&amp;nbsp;TWh with capacity 24,114&amp;nbsp;MW, saving 12 million tons of C0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[Solar Thermal Markets in Europe Trends and Market Statistics 2010], European Solar Thermal Industry Federation (ESTIF) June 2011 p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe the solar heating average yield was about 0.7&amp;nbsp;GWh per MW (17.3&amp;nbsp;TWh/24,114&amp;nbsp;MW). With this average ratio Finland's estimated capacity in 2010 would equal 23 *0.717= 16&amp;nbsp;GWh. This was 32% of the national target by 2010.

==== Solar power ====

During 1995–2010 Finland’s target was 40&amp;nbsp;MW solar power capacity addition producing 50&amp;nbsp;GWh solar power.&lt;ref name="KTL2003"/&gt; In 2010 Finland’s total solar power capacity was 10&amp;nbsp;MW. This was 25% of the national target by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurobserv-er.org/pdf/baro202.asp Photovoltaic energy barometer 2011]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – EurObserv’ER&lt;/ref&gt;

== Space heating==
In 2006 the energy for space heating was 19.5% of total end energy consumption in Finland divided in 44% by fuels, 39% by district heating and 17% by electricity. The district heating systems are mainly monopolies controlled by local politicians or private companies. In practice the owners of the houses with district heating system have no influence in the choice of energy sources or prices.

For example, the politicians of Espoo sold the public district heating system for the big energy company [[Fortum]] in 2006. Since then the district heating prices in Espoo have kept rising and Espoo city has lost tens of millions of euros annually in the energy business compared to nearby cities Helsinki and Vantaa. Further the tax payers have higher district heating costs. Fortum uses 100% fossil energy of natural gas from Russia for district heating. In 2010 [[Fortum]] lobbied for the total restriction by law of all renewable energy alternatives within the district heating areas. This has not been realised, but the renewable alternatives have more control by the public permission system since 2010. The total energy company deal from Espoo to Fortum was worth of 365 million euros for Espoo. The investment of these funds have not given the claimed 5-6% return. In fact, 15 million € was invested in [[Kaupthing]] that was in bancrupt in 9.10.2008. Further Espoo lent a sum of 82 million euros to the state for a motor way project (Kehä 1) with no interest at all during 2008-2013. Even though the commercial investors have received large compensations for their work from Espoo city energy gains, the media have given the impression that the return of funds have not compensated the tax payers costs. In short, the deal can be considers successful for the nuclear company Fortum, but unsuccessful for the Espoo tax payers. There is no effective free competition for district heating in place. Further, one hardly can avoid the impression that the energy and construction companies have mutual interests to promote the dependency on Russian energy. Neither Finnish construction nor energy companies have at least until end 2010 actively promoted higher energy efficiency standards and alternative energy source obligations.

=== Low energy houses===
Among the supporters of solar heating in Finland is architect Bruno Erat who successfully applied solar heating in Finland in the 1970s. Bruno Erat built in 1978 the first low energy building in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Matalaenergiatalossa aurinko lämmittää, Helsingin Sanomat 21.10.2007 F1 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a new low energy house in Heinola Finland saved 70% in warming expenses compared to the equal average warming expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://WWW.yle.fi/uutiset/alueet/lahti/2010/02/matalaenergiatalossa_lammitys_todella_halpaa_1447661.html Matalaenergiatalossa lämmitys todella halpaa] Yle February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mikko Saari (VTT 2004) a low energy block of flats in Finland would save 400 000–1 000 000 € in warming costs in 50 years with 3-6% annual energy price increase.&lt;ref&gt;Matalaenergiatalot ja sähkölämmitys (pdf) 9.11.2004.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing significant construction boom in Finland based on old and high energy demand construction standards since the energy cost payment is paid by the users and future generations but not the construction industry nor its leaders early retirement payrolls. The government strategy (published in 2008) had no aim to reduce the total energy use of buildings by 2020. Many construction companies operating in Finland have also business in Russia.

According to Mr Lauri Myllyvirta [[Greenpeace]] (2008) the potential energy savings in the buildings correspond the electricity of three nuclear plants.&lt;ref&gt;Energia-asiantuntija: Lisämiljoonat tulevat tarpeeseen, Helsingin Sanomat 23.8.2008 A5 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Finland has four nuclear plants and one under construction with an original scheduled start in 2009.

The government of Finland made the climate and energy strategy in October 2008.&lt;ref name="strategy2008"/&gt; It considers energy in 2005, 2020 and 2050. According to this plan the primary energy use in Finland will increase 13% from 2005 to 2020. The use of electricity will grow more 15.4% that energy in average. The same period 2005-2020 the energy use of industry and building is allowed to increase 26.7%. According to the government plan [[Renewable energy in Finland|RE]] of end use will increase 9.5% from 2005 to 2020 but only 4.9% [[Renewable energy in Finland|RE]] of the primary energy use. This shows the importance of definitions.&lt;ref name="strategy2008"/&gt;

The governmental plan 2008 does not address with a clear message the European Union obligation for  20% energy saving by 2020.  In Finnish government target 2008 both the electricity and energy use will increase by 2020. [[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] has a key role in the European climate and energy strategy since March 2007. The European Council has target of 20% energy saving by 2020. The national plans that should include 9% energy saving until 2016 and 20% saving until 2020, were to be delivered to the EU commission in 2007. Some countries set higher targets than the EU obligation. E.g. German target was 30% saving in the public energy use during 1990-2012. British target was carbon neutral state buildings by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52008DC0011:EN:HTML:NOT On a first assessment of national energy efficiency action plans as required by directive 2006/32/ec on energy end-use efficiency and energy services moving forward together on energy efficiency] European Commission Bryssel 23.1.2008&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish strategy includes to move energy intensive companies abroad.

==Sectors==

===Forest industry===
Finnish forest companies are significant players in the global forest industry policy. See e.g. [[UPM (company)|UPM]], [[Stora Enso]] and M real [[Metsäliitto]].

In 2007 the forest industry electricity use was 30.7% of total electricity use in Finland and 53% of all industry electricity use in Finland. In the government target the industry energy use will increase 26.7% from 2005 to 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tilastokeskus.fi/til/ehkh/2007/04/ehkh_2007_04_2008-03-20_tau_014.xls Sähkönkulutus sektoreittain] Statistics of Finland 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The big issue here is that if the industry is allowed to continue its business as usual and increase the energy use, the politicians are obliged to shift the burden of needed energy revolution demand double higher for all the rest of the society.

The Russian timber tax policy has been part of the energy politics in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi\uutiset\kotimaa\oikea\id95935.html Vanhanen: Itämeren kaasuputkea ei pidä sitoa puutulliasiaan] yle 11.07.2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/oikea/id94655.html UM selvittää voidaanko puutullit palauttaa teollisuudelle valtion varoista] yle 26.06.2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 ca 20% of Finnish forest industry was based on Russian timber.&lt;ref name=Iivonen&gt;Metsän henki salpautui Helsingin Sanomat (forest industry editor Mr Jyrki Iivonen) 4.10.2010 B5&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Russian timber export was highest in China. The Russian timber tax policy was also part of [[WTO]] negotiations in 2008. The Finnish ministers discussed the timber tax with the Russian leaders several times e.g. in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/oikea/id107244.html Venäjä lykkää puutulleja jopa vuodella] yle 12.11.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase of energy demand during 2005-2020 is somewhat in conflict with the daily news of the forest industry. During 2000-2010 several forest industry plants have been sold or shut down in Finland and started new forest plants in the Asia and South America. According to industry there were ca 50 forest industry plants in Finland in 2010.&lt;ref name="Iivonen"/&gt; According to Helsingin Sanomat (Mr. Jyrki Iivonen) the employment reduced in the Finnish paper and cell industry by 3,786 persons during 2006-2010. In October 2010 under negotiations were additional 850 jobs in plants of Kouvola (Myllykoski / UPM) and Kotka Sunila (Stora Enso).&lt;ref name="Iivonen"/&gt;

For prevention of the [[global warming]] the emissions of the industry plant in [[Climate change in Finland|Finland]], [[Climate change in Russia|Russia]], [[Climate change in China|China]] or  [[Climate change in Brazil|Brazil]] are equal. The overall global carbon emission and energy use change may be small or negative when the international Finnish company move its production from Finland e.g. in Brazil or China. This information is not specified in the national emission statistics. The company specific data do not always include total worldwide company emissions. According to [[Worldwatch Institute]] the emissions have no national labels in respect to global warming. Among others [[Friends of the Earth]] have criticized [[Stora Enso]] policy in 2009 of the shift in the [[Eucalyptus]] monoculture [[plantation]]s in Brazil endangering the [[rain forests]] and local farmers land ownerships.&lt;ref&gt;Maan Ystävät ja Maattomien Ystävät arvostelevat Stora Ensoa harhaanjohtavasta viestinnästä 04.07.2009 {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traffic ==
The number of cars was in 31.12.2011 ca 3,494,400 which includes 2,978,700passenger cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.fi/til/mkan/2011/mkan_2011_2012-02-24_tau_001_fi.html Liitetaulukko 1. Autot maakunnittain 31.12.2011]

[[Minister of Transport]] / [[Minister of Transport (Finland)|in Finland]] [[Merja Kyllönen]] assigned in 2013 a team led by [[Jorma Ollila]] from [[Royal Dutch Shell]] to study the future [[transport economics]] and [[car taxation]]. Working group suggested a kilometre-based car taxation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvm.fi/topical/4374635/working-group-chaired-by-mr-jorma-ollila-towards-kilometre-based-taxation Working group chaired by Mr Jorma Ollila: Towards kilometre-based taxation] 16.12.2013 Ministry of Transport and Communications in Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;
At least [[Greenpeace]] had criticized the assignment of the major oil company representative in the group leader.
The group suggested decline the car investment tax which is more effective to decline the number of cars on roads than the tax of use. According to [[UITP]] higher forefront cost of the use of car reduce the oil consumption more than the higher running costs. The group also suggested the decline of petrol tax which would be more unfavorable for petrol cars compared to [[electric car]]. Electric cars are less noisy, polluting (with [[wind power]]) and have cheaper fuel than the petrol cars.

Present vehicle tax gives opportunity to promote the low emission compared to high emission cars investments. (HS 18.12.2013 A16 Tiainen)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2063">'''Haines Index''' (also known as Lower Atmosphere Severity Index) is a weather index developed by [[meteorologist]] Donald Haines in 1988 that measures the potential for dry, unstable air to contribute to the development of large or erratic wildland fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haines Index |url=http://www.ncrs.fs.fed.us/4401/focus/haines/ |publisher=USA Forest Service |accessdate=16 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416182854/http://www.ncrs.fs.fed.us/4401/focus/haines/ |archivedate=April 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The index is derived from the stability (temperature difference between different levels of the atmosphere) and moisture content ([[dew point depression]]) of the lower [[atmosphere]]. These data may be acquired with a [[radiosonde]] or simulated by a numerical weather prediction model. The index is calculated over three ranges of atmospheric pressure: low elevation (950-850 [[Bar (unit)|millibars (mb)]]), mid elevation (850-700 mb), and high elevation (700-500 mb).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/firecomp/INFO/hainesinfo.html Noaa]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Haines Index of 6 means a high potential for an existing fire to become large or exhibit erratic fire behavior, 5 means medium potential, 4 means low potential, and anything less than 4 means very low potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winkler|first1=Julie A.|last2=Potter|first2=Brian E.|last3=Wilhelm|first3=Dwight F.|last4=Shadbolt|first4=Ryan P.|last5=Piromsopa|first5=Krerk|last6=Bian|first6=Xindi|title=Climatological and statistical characteristics of the Haines Index for North America|journal=International Journal of Wildland Fire|date=2007|volume=16|issue=2|pages=139–152|doi=10.1071/WF06086}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://graphical.weather.gov/definitions/defineHaines.html Haines index definition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hamza Stone''' ({{lang-tr|'''Hamza Taşı'''}}) is a large black-colored boulder on the eastern coast of [[Giresun Island]] in the [[Black Sea]], located 1.2 km off the coast of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] city of [[Giresun]]. The stone, known to locals since around 2000 BCE, symbolizes [[Kybele]], an ancient Anatolian [[mother goddess]]. 

The stone sits on a device, also made of stone, with three legs similar to a very short tripod (''[[saçayak]]'', "saç foot", in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], derived from its use to elevate a ''[[saç]]'' (pan) above the ground). It is estimated that the Hamza Stone has been a wish stone since 4,000 years before the present. Today, in the third ritual of ceremony programme of the local [[Aksu, Giresun#Aksu Festival|Aksu Festival]], the stone is visited as a tradition. The tour around Giresun Island begins in front of the stone and returns to it in the end. Traditionally, visitors to the stone would put their hands on it and make wishes. It is believed that childless women that put their hands on the stone would soon bear a child. Because the traditional Anatolian and Turkish fireplace (or [[hearth]]), composed of a ''saçayak'' and a fire, is considered a symbol of having a home and a family, the stone represents fertility.

[[Image:Zealandia-Continent map en.svg|thumb|One of the major divisions of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], the Hikurangi Plateau (top right) drifted south and collided with parts of the mostly submerged continent.]]
The '''Hikurangi Plateau''' is an [[oceanic plateau]] in the South Pacific Ocean east of the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]].  It is part of a [[large igneous province]] (LIP) together with [[Manihiki Plateau|Manihiki]] and [[Ontong Java Plateau|Ontong Java]], now located {{Convert|3000|km|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|3500|km|abbr=on}} north of Hikurangi respectively.&lt;ref name="Hoernle-intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|Werner|2010|loc=Introduction, pp. 7196–7198}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mount Hikurangi (Gisborne District)|Mount Hikurangi]], in [[Māori mythology]] the first part of North Island to emerge from the ocean, gave its name to the plateau.

==Geological setting==
The Hikurangi Plateau covers approximately {{Convert|400000|km2|abbr=on}} and reaches {{Convert|2500|-|3000|m|abbr=on}} below sea level.&lt;ref name="Hoernle-geology"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|Werner|2010|loc=Geological overview, morphology and rock types, pp. 7198–7200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hikurangi Plateau is cut by the Hikurangi Channel, a 2000&amp;nbsp;km [[abyssal channel]] that starts at [[Kaikoura]] and runs along the [[Hikurangi Trench]] as far as the [[Mahia Peninsula]] before crossing the plateau and ending in the South-west Pacific abyssal plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|Nodder|Carter|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tectonic evolution==
Two models have been proposed for the formation of Hikurangi.  It can be derived from the mantle plume that caused the break-up of [[Gondwana]] and the separation of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]] from Antarctica 107&amp;nbsp;Ma.  Alternatively, it could have formed together with other Pacific plateaux around 120&amp;nbsp;Ma as part of the [[Ontong Java Plateau|Ontong Java]]-[[Manihiki Plateau|Manihiki]]-Hikurangi mega-plateau, in which case Hikurangi must have drifted thousands of kilometres during the [[Magnetic reversal#Superchrons|Cretaceous silent period]] (84–121&amp;nbsp;Ma) before colliding with Gondwana.&lt;ref name="Hoernle-intro" /&gt;

A 2010 study of isotopic data supported the mega-plateau or "[[Greater Ontong Java Event]]" model.  The study added several basins as remains of this LIP event, including the north-west part of the Central Pacific, Nauru, East Mariana, and Lyra basins&amp;nbsp;— submarine volcanism that must have covered 1% of Earth's surface and had a dramatic impact on life on Earth.  There are, nevertheless, traces in seamounts on Hikurangi of a second Late Cretaceous magmatic event contemporaneous with volcanism on New Zealand and associated with the final break-up of Gondwana.&lt;ref name="Hoernle-intro" /&gt;

The Hikurangi Plateau has been partly subducted under the [[Chatham Rise]], probably during the Cretaceous, and probably resulting in a slab more than {{Convert|150|km|abbr=on}} long.  The western margin of the plateau is actively subducting under the [[North Island]] of New Zealand to a depth of {{Convert|65|km|abbr=on}}.  With these missing portions of the plateau added to it, the Hikurangi Plateau originally must have covered {{Convert|800000|km2|abbr=on}}, an area similar to that of the Manihiki Plateau {{Convert|3000|km|abbr=on}} to the north.&lt;ref name="Hoernle-geology" /&gt;

The Hikurangi Plateau first subducted beneath New Zealand around 100&amp;nbsp;Ma during the Gondwana collision and it is currently subducting a second time as part of the convergence between the Pacific and Australian plates.  These subducted parts are reaching {{Convert|37|–|140|km|abbr=on}} into the mantle beneath the North Island and northern [[South Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reyners|Eberhart-Phillips|Bannister|2011|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The extent of the Hikurangi Plateau slab suggests that it has played a significant role in the [[geology of New Zealand]] during the past 100&amp;nbsp;Ma.  The [[Southern Alps]] in central South Island are being uplifted along the plate boundary there, a fault zone which parallels the western edge of the slab of the Hikurangi Plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Reyners|Eberhart-Phillips|Bannister|2011|loc=Discussion, pp. 170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian and Pacific plates converge obliquely in the [[Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone|Tonga-Kermadec-Hikurangi subduction zone]].  The Hikurangi Plateau alters this subduction beneath North Island, at the Hikurangi subduction zone, where the buoyancy of the slab has resulted in the exposure of a [[forearc]] and hence earthquakes such as the 7.8&amp;nbsp;[[moment magnitude scale|M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henrys|Reyners|Pecher|Bannister|2006|loc=Hikurangi subduction zone, p. 777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="99306">The '''home front during World War I''' covers the domestic, economic, social and political histories of countries involved in [[World War I|that conflict]]. It covers the mobilization of armed forces and war supplies, but does not include the military history. For nonmilitary interactions among the major players see [[Diplomatic history of World War I]].

About 10 million combatants and seven million civilians [[World War I casualties|died during the entire war]], including many weakened by years of malnutrition; they fell in the worldwide [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Flu pandemic]], which struck late in 1918, just as the war was ending.

The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] had much more potential wealth that they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars), is that the Allies spent $147 billion on the war and the [[Central Powers]] only $61 billion. Among the Allies, Britain and its Empire spent $47 billion and the US $27 billion; among the Central Powers, Germany spent $45 billion.&lt;ref&gt;H.E. Fisk, ''The Inter-Allied Debts'' (1924) pp 13 &amp; 325 reprinted in Horst Menderhausen, ''The Economics of War'' (1943 edition), appendix table II&lt;/ref&gt;

Total war demanded total mobilization of all the nation's resources for a common goal. Manpower had to be channeled into the front lines (all the powers except the United States and Britain had large trained reserves designed for just that). Behind the lines labor power had to be redirected away from less necessary activities that were luxuries during a total war. In particular, vast munitions industries had to be built up to provide shells, guns, warships, uniforms, airplanes, and a hundred other weapons, both old and new. Agriculture had to be mobilized as well, to provide food for both civilians and for soldiers (many of whom had been farmers and needed to be replaced by old men, boys and women) and for horses to move supplies. Transportation in general was a challenge, especially when Britain and Germany each tried to intercept merchant ships headed for the enemy. Finance was a special challenge. Germany financed the Central Powers. Britain financed the Allies until 1916, when it ran out of money and had to borrow from the United States. The US took over the financing of the Allies in 1917 with loans that it insisted be repaid after the war.  The victorious Allies looked to defeated Germany in 1919 to pay "reparations" that would cover some of their costs. Above all, it was essential to conduct the mobilization in such a way that the short term confidence of the people was maintained, the long-term power of the political establishment was upheld, and the long-term economic health of the nation was preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Hardach, ''First World War: 1914–1918'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; For more details on economics see [[Economic history of World War I]].

World War I had a profound impact on woman suffrage across the belligerents. Women played a major role on the homefronts and many countries recognized their sacrifices with the vote during or shortly after the war, including the United States, Britain, Canada (except Quebec), Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Sweden and Ireland. France almost did so but stopped short.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Palm | first = Trineke | title = Embedded in social cleavages: an explanation of the variation in timing of women's suffrage | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–22 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2012.00294.x | date = March 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.2012.00294.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial costs==
{{Further|Economic history of World War I}}
The total direct cost of war, for all participants including those not listed here, was about $80 billion (in 1913 US dollars) Since $1 billion in 1913 = about $25 billion in 2017 US dollars the total cost comes to about $2 trillion in 2017 dollars. Direct cost is figured as actual expenditures during war minus normal prewar spending. It excludes postwar costs such as pensions, interest, and veteran hospitals.  Loans to/from allies are not included in "direct cost". Repayment of loans after 1918 is not included.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Fisk, ''The Inter-Ally Debts: An Analysis of War and Post-War Public Finance, 1914-1923'' (1924) pp 1, 21-37. The book is online at [https://www.questia.com/read/4869024/the-inter-ally-debts-an-analysis-of-war-and-post-war Questia]&lt;/ref&gt;
The total direct cost of the war as a percent of wartime national income:
* '''Allies''': Britain, 37%; France, 26%; Italy, 19%; Russia, 24%; United States, 16%.
* '''Central Powers''': Austria-Hungary, 24%; Germany, 32%; Turkey unknown.
The amounts listed below are presented in terms of 1913 US dollars, where $1 billion then equals about $25 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, ''The Inter-Ally Debts'' pp 21-37.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Britain had a direct war cost about $21.2 billion; it made loans to Allies and Dominions of $4.886 billion, and received loans from the United States of $2.909 billion.
*France had a direct war cost about $10.1 billion; it made loans to Allies of $1.104 billion, and received loans from Allies (United States and Britain) of $2.909 billion.
*Italy had a direct war cost about $4.5 billion; it received loans from Allies (United States and Britain) of $1.278 billion.
* The United States had a direct war cost about $12.3 billion; it made loans to Allies of $5.041 billion.
*Russia had a direct war cost about $7.7 billion; it received loans from Allies (United States and Britain) of $2.289 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gatrell, ''Russia's First World War: A Social and Economic History'' (2005) pp 132-53&lt;/ref&gt;

The two governments agreed that financially Britain would support the weaker Allies and that France would take care of itself.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Horn,  ''Britain, France, and the financing of the First World War'' (2002) ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1914, [[Henry Pomeroy Davison]], a Morgan partner, traveled to London and made a deal with the [[Bank of England]] to make J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. the sole underwriter of [[war bonds]] for Great Britain and France.  The Bank of England became a fiscal agent of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., and ''vice versa''. Over the course of the war, J.P. Morgan loaned about $1.5 billion (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1.5|1929|r=0}}}} billion in today's dollars) to the Allies to fight against the Germans.&lt;ref name=wolff&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Sun: The Brief Transit and Violent Eclipse of Harry Crosby |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RpVaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pgis=1|author=Geoffrey Wolff|year=2003|isbn=1-59017-066-0|publisher=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}} Morgan also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France, thus profiting from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments.

Britain made heavy loans to Tsarist Russia; the Lenin government after 1920 refused to honor them, causing long-term issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Siegel, ''For Peace and Money: French and British Finance in the Service of Tsars and Commissars'' (Oxford UP, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
{{main article|History of the United Kingdom during World War I|British entry into World War I}}
{{see also|Timeline of the United Kingdom home front during World War I}}

At the outbreak of war, patriotic feelings spread throughout the country, and many of the class barriers of [[Edwardian England|Edwardian era]] faded during the years of combat.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/britain/war_changing.htm "The war and the changing face of British society"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Catholics in southern Ireland moved overnight to demands for complete immediate independence after the failed [[Easter Rebellion]] of 1916. Northern Ireland remained loyal to the crown.

In 1914 Britain had by far the largest and most efficient financial system in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Godden,  "The Business of War: Reflections on Recent Contributions to the Economic and Business Histories of the First World War." ''Œconomia. History, Methodology, Philosophy'' 6#4 (2016): 549-556. [https://oeconomia.revues.org/2519 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Roger Lloyd-Jones and M. J. Lewis argue:
:To prosecute industrial war required the mobilisation of economic resources for the mass production of weapons and munitions, which necessarily entitled fundamental changes in the relationship between the state (the procurer), business (the provider), labour (the key productive input), and the military (the consumer). In this context, the industrial battlefields of France and Flanders intertwined with the home front that produced the materials to sustain a war over four long and bloody years.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lloyd-Jones and M. J. Lewis, ''Arming the Western Front: War, Business and the State in Britain, 1900–1920'' (Routledge, 2016), p 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic sacrifices were made, however, in the name of defeating the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Broadberry and Peter Howlett, "The United Kingdom during World War I: business as usual?" in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915 Liberal politician [[David Lloyd George]] took charge of the newly created Ministry of Munitions. He dramatically increased the output of artillery shells—the main weapon actually used in battle. In 1916 he became secretary for war. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith was a disappointment; he formed a coalition government in 1915 but it was also ineffective. Asquith was replaced by Lloyd George in late 1916. He had a strong hand in the managing of every affair, making many decisions himself. Historians credit Lloyd George with providing the driving energy and organisation that won the War.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (1965) pp.&amp;nbsp;34–5, 54, 58, 73–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[German strategic bombing during World War I|Germans were using Zeppelins to bomb the cities]], morale remained relatively high due in part to the propaganda churned out by the national newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Ian F. W. Beckett, ''The Great war'' (2nd ed. 2007) pp 394–395&lt;/ref&gt; With a severe shortage of skilled workers, industry redesigned work so that it could be done by unskilled men and women (termed the "dilution of labour") so that war-related industries grew rapidly. Lloyd George cut a deal with the trades unions—they approved the dilution (since it would be temporary) and threw their organizations into the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett (2007), pp. 341, 455&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Arthur Marwick]] saw a radical transformation of British society, a deluge that swept away many old attitudes and brought in a more equalitarian society. He also saw the famous literary pessimism of the 1920s as misplaced, for there were major positive long-term consequences of the war. He pointed to new job opportunities and self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, to the coming of partial woman suffrage, and to an acceleration of social reform and state control of the British economy. He found a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and a weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual moral behavior. Marwick concluded that class differentials softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Marwick, ''The Deluge: British Society and the First World War'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; During the conflict, the various elements of the British Left created the War Emergency Workers' National Committee, which played a crucial role in supporting the most vulnerable people on the Home Front during the war, and in ensuring the British Labour remained united in the years after the Armistice.&lt;ref&gt;David Swift,  "The War Emergency: Workers' National Committee." ''History Workshop Journal'' 81 (2016): 84-105. [https://doi.org/10.1093/hwj/dbv041]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Scotland===
Scotland played a major role in the British effort in the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;C. M. M. Macdonald and E. W. McFarland, eds, ''Scotland and the Great War'' (Edinburgh: Tuckwell Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, food (particularly fish) and money, engaging with the conflict with some enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;D. Daniel, "Measures of enthusiasm: new avenues in quantifying variations in voluntary enlistment in Scotland, August 1914-December 1915", ''Local Population Studies,'' Spring 2005, Issue 74, pp.&amp;nbsp;16–35.&lt;/ref&gt; With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the war, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded.&lt;ref&gt;I. F. W. Beckett and K. R. Simpson, eds. ''A Nation in Arms: a Social Study of the British Army in the First World War'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1985) p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Houston and W. W. Knox, eds, ''The New Penguin History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 2001),  p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish urban centres, with their poverty and unemployment were favourite recruiting grounds of the regular British army, and Dundee, where the female dominated jute industry limited male employment had one of the highest proportion of reservists and serving soldiers than almost any other British city.&lt;ref name=Lenman&amp;Mackie1991&gt;B. Lenman and J., Mackie, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_cvp_njNb2sC&amp;pg=PT457&amp;dq=martial+races+scotland+%22first+world+war%22&amp;hl=En&amp;ei=yzfQTu7dI8vn8QP0u6GxBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=martial%20races%20scotland%20%22first%20world%20war%22&amp;f=false ''A History of Scotland''] (London: Penguin, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Concern for their families' standard of living made men hesitate to enlist; voluntary enlistment rates went up after the government guaranteed a weekly stipend for life to the survivors of men who were killed or disabled.&lt;ref&gt;D. Coetzee, "A life and death decision: the influence of trends in fertility, nuptiality and family economies on voluntary enlistment in Scotland, August 1914 to December 1915", ''Family and Community History'', Nov 2005, vol. 8 (2), pp.&amp;nbsp;77–89.&lt;/ref&gt; After the introduction of conscription from January 1916 every part of the country was affected. Occasionally Scottish troops made up large proportions of the active combatants, and suffered corresponding loses, as at the [[Battle of Loos]], where there were three full Scots divisions and other Scottish units.&lt;ref name=Lenman&amp;Mackie1991/&gt; Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead.&lt;ref name=Buchanan2003p49&gt;J. Buchanan, ''Scotland'' (Langenscheidt, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas, like the thinly populated Island of [[Lewis and Harris]] suffered some of the highest proportional losses of any part of Britain.&lt;ref name=Lenman&amp;Mackie1991/&gt; Clydeside shipyards and the nearby engineering shops were the major centers of war industry in Scotland. In Glasgow, radical agitation led to industrial and political unrest that continued after the war ended.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Lenman, ''An Economic History of Modern Scotland: 1660–1976'' (1977) pp&amp;nbsp;206–14&lt;/ref&gt;

In Glasgow, the heavy demand for munitions and warships strengthened union power. There emerged a radical movement called "[[Red Clydeside]]" led by militant trades unionists.  Formerly a Liberal Party stronghold, the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922, with a base among the Irish Catholic working class districts.  Women were especially active solidarity on housing issues. However, the "Reds" operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament; the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean, ''The Legend of Red Clydeside'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{See also|David Lloyd George}}
[[David Lloyd George]] became prime minister in December 1916 and immediately transformed the British war effort, taking firm control of both military and domestic policy.&lt;ref&gt;John Grigg, ''Lloyd George: War Leader 1916–1918'' (2002) vol 4 pp&amp;nbsp;1–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (1965) pp&amp;nbsp;73–99&lt;/ref&gt;

In rapid succession in spring 1918 came a series of military and political crises.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (1965) pp&amp;nbsp;100–106&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans, having moved troops from the Eastern front and retrained them in new tactics, now had more soldiers on the Western Front than the Allies. Germany launched a full scale [[Spring Offensive]] ([[Operation Michael|Operation ''Michael'']]), starting March 21 against the British and French lines, with the hope of victory on the battlefield before the American troops arrived in numbers. The Allied armies fell back 40 miles in confusion, and facing defeat, London realized it needed more troops to fight a mobile war. Lloyd George found a half million soldiers and rushed them to France, asked American President Woodrow Wilson for immediate help, and agreed to the appointment of French General Foch as commander-in-chief on the Western Front so that Allied forces could be coordinated to handle the German offensive.&lt;ref&gt;John Grigg, ''Lloyd George: War Leader 1916–1918'' (2002) vol 4 pp&amp;nbsp;478–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite strong warnings it was a bad idea, the War Cabinet [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|decided to impose conscription on Ireland]]. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that the draft actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted but never enforced. The Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray and called for open resistance to a draft. Many Irish Catholics and nationalists moved into the intransigent [[Sinn Féin]] movement. This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Alan J. Ward, "Lloyd George and the 1918 Irish Conscription Crisis," ''Historical Journal'' (1974) 17#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;107–129 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638335 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grigg, ''Lloyd George'' vol 4 pp&amp;nbsp;465–88&lt;/ref&gt;

When on May 7, 1918, a senior army general on active duty, Major-General Sir [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Frederick Maurice]] went public with allegations that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament on military matters, [[Maurice Debate|a crisis was at hand]]. The German spring offensive had made unexpected major gains, and a scapegoat was needed. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal), which further split the Liberal Party. While Asquith's presentation was poorly done, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote of confidence. He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of the military.&lt;ref&gt;John Gooch, "The Maurice Debate 1918," ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1968) 3#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;211–228 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259859 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Grigg, ''Lloyd George: War leader, 1916–1918'' (London: Penguin, 2002), pp&amp;nbsp;489–512&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the German offensive stalled. By summer the Americans were sending 10,000 fresh men a day to the Western Front, a more rapid response made possible by leaving their equipment behind and using British and French munitions. The German army had used up its last reserves and was steadily shrinking in number and weakening in resolve. Victory came on November 11, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (1965) pp&amp;nbsp;108–11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] was clear about how important the women were:
:It would have been utterly impossible for us to have waged a successful war had it not been for the skill and ardour, enthusiasm and industry which the women of this country have thrown into the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bob Whitfield|first=|title=The Extension of the Franchise, 1832-1931|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-Rd0iLobaEC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2001|publisher=Heinemann|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The militant suffragette movement was suspended during the war, and at the time people credited the new patriotic roles women played as earning them the vote in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (1965) p. 29, 94&lt;/ref&gt; However, British historians no longer emphasize the granting of woman suffrage as a reward for women's participation in war work. Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganizing effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Martin D. Pugh, "Politicians and the Woman's Vote 1914–1918," ''History,'' (1974), Vol. 59 Issue 197, pp&amp;nbsp;358–374&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers. Women in Britain finally achieved suffrage on the same terms as men in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Searle, ''A New England? Peace and war, 1886–1918'' (2004) p 791&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Empire==
The British Empire provided imports of food and raw material, worldwide network of naval bases, and a steady flow of soldiers and workers into Britain.  &lt;ref&gt;Ashley Jackson, "The British Empire and the First World War"''BBC History Magazine'' 9#11 (2008) [https://britishempireatwardotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bbc-history-magazine2.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Canada in the World Wars and Interwar Years#World War I}}
The 620,000 men in service were most notable for combat in the trenches of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]; there were 67,000 war dead and 173,000 wounded. This total does not include the 2,000 deaths and 9,000 injuries in December 1917 when [[Halifax Explosion|a munitions ship exploded in Halifax.]]&lt;ref&gt;War Office, ''Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire During the Great War 1914–1920'' (London, 1922) p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteering provided enough soldiers at first, but high casualties soon required conscription, which was strongly opposed by Francophones. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] saw the Liberal Party ripped apart, to the advantage of the Conservatives Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]], who led a [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Unionist coalition]] to a landslide victory in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Craig Brown and Ramsay Cook, ''Canada, 1896–1921 A Nation Transformed'' (1974) ch 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Distrusting the loyalties of [[Canadians of German ethnicity]] and, especially, recent immigrants from the [[Ukrainian Canadian|Ukraine]] (who were citizens of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), the government interned thousands of aliens.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Swyripa and John Herd Thompson, eds. ''Loyalties in Conflict: Ukrainians in Canada During the Great War'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

The war validated Canada's new world role, in an almost-equal partnership with Britain in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Arguing that Canada had become a true nation on the battlefields of Europe, Borden demanded and received a separate seat for Canada at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. Canada's military and civilian participation in the First World War strengthened a sense of British-Canadian nationhood among the Anglophones (English speakers). The Francophones (French speakers) supported the war at first, but pulled back and stood aloof after 1915 because of language disputes at home. Heroic memories centered around the "[[Canada's Hundred Days]]" battles of 1917, especially the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] where 3,600 died.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Hucker, "'Battle and Burial': Recapturing the Cultural Meaning of Canada's National Memorial on Vimy Ridge," ''Public Historian,'' (Feb 2009) 31#1 pp&amp;nbsp;89–109&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:SLNSW 75769 To my Dear Friend on Active Service postcard with Kookaburra and text.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|An Australian [[Kookaburra]] active service postcard]]
[[Billy Hughes]], prime minister from October 1915, expanded the government's role in the economy, while dealing with intense debates over the issue of conscription.&lt;ref&gt;Kosmas Tsokhas, "The Forgotten Economy and Australia's Involvement in the Great War," ''Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft'' (1993) 4#2 331-357&lt;/ref&gt;

From a population of five million, 417,000 men enlisted; 330,000 went overseas to fight during the First World War. They were all volunteers, since the political battle for compulsory conscription failed. Some 58,000 died and 156,000 were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/ww1.asp "First World War 1914–18" from Australian War Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher argues that the government aggressively promoted economic, industrial, and social modernization in the war years.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Fischer, "'Negative integration' and an Australian road to modernity: Interpreting the Australian homefront experience in World War I," ''Australian Historical Studies,'' (April 1995) 26#104 pp&amp;nbsp;452–76&lt;/ref&gt; However, he says it came through exclusion and repression. He says the war turned a peaceful nation into "one that was violent, aggressive, angst- and conflict-ridden, torn apart by invisible front lines of sectarian division, ethnic conflict and socio-economic and political upheaval." The nation was fearful of enemy aliens—especially Germans, regardless of how closely they identified with Australia. The government interned 2,900 German-born men (40% of the total) and deported 700 of them after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Davidson et al., ''The Oxford Companion to Australian History'' (2nd ed. 2001) p&amp;nbsp;283–4&lt;/ref&gt; Irish nationalists and labor radicals were under suspicion as well. Racist hostility was high toward nonwhites, including Pacific Islanders, Chinese and Aborigines. The result, Fischer says, was a strengthening of conformity to imperial/British loyalties and an explicit preference for immigrants from the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, "'Negative integration' and an Australian road to modernity" p. 452 for quote&lt;/ref&gt;

The major military event involved sending 40,000 ANZAC (Australia and New Zealand) soldiers in 1915 to seize the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli peninsula]] near Constantinople to open an Allied route to Russia and weaken the Ottoman Empire. The campaign was a total failure militarily and 8,100 Australians died. However the memory was all-important, for it transformed the Australian mind and became an iconic element of the Australian identity and the founding moment of nationhood.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Beaumont, ''Australia's War 1914–18'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internment of German aliens====
The ''[[War Precautions Act 1914]]'' of 1914 provided the Commonwealth government with wide-ranging powers for a period of up to six months after the duration of the war.&lt;ref name=homefront&gt;
{{cite web|title=Home front Powers 1914–1918 |publisher=anzacday.org |date= |url=http://www.anzacday.org.au/history/ww1/homefront/powers.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010415012538/http://www.anzacday.org.au/history/ww1/homefront/powers.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 April 2001 |accessdate=2 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It covered: the prevention of trade with hostile nations, issuing loans to pay for the war effort, the introduction of a national taxation scheme, the fixing of the prices of certain goods, the internment of people considered a danger to Australia, the compulsory purchase of strategic goods, and the censorship of the media.&lt;ref name=homefront/&gt;

At the outbreak of the war there were about 35,000 people who had been born in either Germany or Austria-Hungary living in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (7th ed. 1941) p 105 [http://www.awm.gov.au/histories/first_world_war/volume.asp?levelID=67897 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  They had weak ties with Germany (and almost none to Austria) and many had enlisted in the Australian war effort. Nevertheless, fears ran high and internment camps were set up where those suspected of unpatriotic acts were sent. In total 4,500 people were interned under the provisions of the ''War Precautions Act'', of which 700 were naturalised Australians and 70 Australian born. Following the end of the war, 6,150 were deported.&lt;ref name=homefront2&gt;{{cite web|title=Internment in Australia during WWI |publisher=anzacday.org |date= |url=http://www.anzacday.org.au/history/ww1/homefront/enemy.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010415020511/http://www.anzacday.org.au/history/ww1/homefront/enemy.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 April 2001 |accessdate=2 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economy====
[[File:Australian Honour Flag.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Australian Honour Flag]], awarded to subscribers of the Australian Government's 7th War Loan in 1918]]
In 1914 the Australian economy was small but very nearly the most propserous in the world per capita; it depended on the export of wool and mutton. London provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth nations to continue. London imposed controls so that no exports would wind up in German hands. The British government protected prices by buying Australian products, even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) p.&amp;nbsp;516–18, 539.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the whole, Australian commerce was expanded due to the war, although the cost of the war was quite considerable and the Australian government had to borrow considerably from overseas to fund the war effort. In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, while the number of Australians employed in manufacturing industries increased over 11 per cent. Iron mining and steel manufacture grew enormously.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901–1975''  (1977) p 110&lt;/ref&gt; Inflation became a factor as the prices of [[consumer goods]] went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp. 549, 563&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade union movement, already powerful, grew rapidly, although the movement was split on the political question of conscription. It expelled the politicians, such as Hughes, who favoured conscription (which was never passed into law).&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Macintyre, ''The Oxford History of Australia: Volume 4: 1901–42, the Succeeding Age'' (1987) pp&amp;nbsp;163–75&lt;/ref&gt; The government sought to stabilize wages, much to the anger of unionists. the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8 and 12 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation. Angry workers launched a wave of strikes against both the wage freeze and the conscription proposal. Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and it has been estimated that between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days being lost and a £4,785,607 deficit in wages.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp.&amp;nbsp;663–65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901–1975''  (1977) p&amp;nbsp;110–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the war had a significantly negative impact on the Australia economy. Real aggregate [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) declined by 9.5 percent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a six percent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, failing by 16 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Ian W. McLean, ''Why Australia Prospered: The Shifting Sources of Economic Growth'' (2013), pp. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The country remained an enthusiastic supporter of the Empire, enlisting 124,211 men and sending 100,444 to fight in [[World War I]] (see [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]]). Over 18,000 died in service. Conscription was introduced in mid 1916 and by the end of the war near 1 in four members of the NZEF was a conscript.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Loveridge, ''Calls to Arms: New Zealand Society and Commitment to the Great War'' (Wellington: Victoria University Press, 2014) p.26&lt;/ref&gt; As in Australia, involvement in the Gallipoli campaign became an iconic touchstone in New Zealand memory of the war and was commonly connected to imaginings of collective identity.

The war divided the labour movement with numerous elements taking up roles in the war effort while others alleged the war was an imperial venture against the interests of the working class.  Labour MPs frequently acted as critics of government policy during the war and opposition to conscription saw the modern Labour Party formed in 1916. Maori tribes that had been close to the government sent their young men to volunteer.  The mobilisation of women for war work/service was relatively slight compared to more industrialised countries. Though some 640 women served as nurses with 500 going overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Gwen Parsons, "The New Zealand Home Front during World War One and World War Two," ''History Compass'' (2013) 11#6 pp&amp;nbsp;419–428&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand forces captured [[Western Samoa]] from Germany in the early stages of the war, and New Zealand administered the country until Samoan Independence in 1962. However many Samoans greatly resented the administration, and blamed inflation and the catastrophic 1918 flu epidemic on New Zealand rule.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Hiery, "West Samoans between Germany and New Zealand 1914–1921," ''War and Society'' (1992) 10#1 pp&amp;nbsp;53–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
South Africa had a military role in the war, fighting the Germans in East Africa and on the Western Front.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Nasson, ''Springboks on the Somme: South Africa in the Great War, 1914–1918'' (2007); Anne Samson, ''Britain, South Africa and the East Africa Campaign, 1914–1918: The Union Comes of Age'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion in South Africa split along racial and ethnic lines. The British elements strongly supported the war and comprised the great majority of the 146,000 white soldiers. Nasson says, "for many enthusiastic English-speaking Union recruits, going to war was anticipated as an exciting adventure, egged on by the itch of making a manly mark upon a heroic cause."&lt;ref&gt;Nasson, ''Springboks on the Somme'' ch 8&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the Indian element (led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]), generally supported the war effort. Afrikaners were split, with some like Prime Minister [[Louis Botha]] and General [[Jan Smuts]] taking a prominent leadership role in the British war effort. Their pro-British position was rejected by many rural Afrikaners who favoured Germany and who launched the [[Maritz Rebellion]], a small-scale open revolt against the government. The trade union movement was divided. Many urban blacks supported the war, expecting it would raise their status in society. Others said it was not relevant to the struggle for their rights. The Coloured element was generally supportive and many served in a Coloured Corps in East Africa and France, also hoping to better their lot after the war. Those blacks and Coloureds who supported the war were embittered when the postwar era saw no easing of white domination and restrictive conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Nasson, "A Great Divide: Popular Responses to the Great War in South Africa," ''War &amp; Society'' (1994) 12#1 pp&amp;nbsp;47–64&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The British controlled India (including modern Pakistan and Bangladesh) either directly through the [[British Raj]] or indirectly through [[Princely state|local princes]]. The colonial government of India supported the war enthusiastically, and enlarged the British Indian army by a factor of 500% to 1.4 million men. It sent 550,000 overseas, with 200,000 going as labourers to the Western Front and the rest to the Middle East theatre. Only a few hundred were allowed to become officers, but there were some 100,000 casualties. The main fighting of the latter group was in Iraq, where large numbers were killed and captured in the initial stages of the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], most infamously during the [[Siege of Kut]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker,  ''European Powers,'' pp&amp;nbsp;353–4&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian contingent was entirely funded by the Indian taxpayers (who had no vote and no voice in the matter).

Although Germany and the Ottoman Empire tried to incite anti-British subversion with the help of Indian freedom fighters, such as [[Rash Bihari Bose]] or [[Bagha Jatin]], they had virtually no success, apart from a localized [[1915 Singapore Mutiny]],&lt;ref&gt;Hew Strachan, ''The First World War'' (2001) 1:791-814&lt;/ref&gt; which was a part of the [[Ghadar Mutiny|Gadar conspiracy]]. The small Indian industrial base expanded dramatically to provide most of the supplies and munitions for the Middle East theatre.&lt;ref&gt;David Stevenson, ''With Our Backs to the Wall'' (2011) pp&amp;nbsp;257–8, 381&lt;/ref&gt; Indian nationalists became well organized for the first time during the war, and were stunned when they received little in the way of self-government in the aftermath of victory.

In 1918, India experienced an influenza epidemic and severe food shortages.

==Belgium==
{{main article|Belgium in World War I|Rape of Belgium}}
Nearly all of Belgium was occupied by the Germans, but the government and army escaped and fought the war on a narrow slice of the Western Front. The German invaders treated any resistance—such as sabotaging rail lines—as illegal and immoral, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation. The German army executed over 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. The German Army destroyed 15,000-20,000 buildings—most famously the university library at Louvain—and generated a refugee wave of over a million people. Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents.&lt;ref&gt;John Horne and Alan Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' (Yale U.P. 2001) ch 1-2, esp. p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of workers were shipped to Germany to work in factories. British propaganda dramatizing the [[Rape of Belgium]] attracted much attention in the US, while Berlin said it was legal and necessary because of the threat of "franc-tireurs" (guerrillas) like those in France in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Horne and Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' ch 3-4 show there were no "franc-tireurs"  in Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt; The British and French magnified the reports and disseminated them at home and in the US, where they played a major role in dissolving support for Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Horne and Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' ch 5-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans left Belgium stripped and barren. They shipped machinery to Germany while destroying factories.&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Kossmann. ''The Low Countries'' (1978), p&amp;nbsp;523–35&lt;/ref&gt; After the atrocities of the first few weeks, German civil servants took control and were generally correct, albeit strict and severe. There was no violent resistance movement, but there was a large-scale spontaneous passive resistance of a refusal to work for the benefit of German victory. Belgium was heavily industrialized; while farms operated and small shops stayed open, most large establishments shut down or drastically reduced their output. The faculty closed the universities; publishers shut down most newspapers. Most Belgians "turned the four war years into a long and extremely dull vacation, says Kiossmann.&lt;ref&gt;Kossmann, p 525&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutrals led by the United States set up the Commission for Relief in Belgium, headed by American engineer [[Herbert Hoover]]. It shipped in large quantities of food and medical supplies, which it tried to reserve for civilians and keep out of the hands of the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Johan den Hertog, "The Commission for Relief in Belgium and the Political Diplomatic History of the First World War," ''Diplomacy and Statecraft,'' (Dec 2010) 21#4 pp&amp;nbsp;593–613,&lt;/ref&gt; Many businesses collaborated with the Germans, and some women cohabitated with them. They were treated roughly in a wave of popular violence in November and December 1918. The government set up judicial proceedings to punish the collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence van Ypersele and Xavier Rousseaux, "Leaving the War: Popular Violence and Judicial Repression of 'unpatriotic' behaviour in Belgium (1918–1921)," ''European Review of History'' (Spring 2005) 12#3 pp&amp;nbsp;3–22&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 the king organized a new ministry and introduced universal male suffrage. The Socialists—mostly poor workers—benefited more than the more middle class Catholics and Liberals.

===Belgian Congo===
Rubber had long been the main export; production levels held up but its importance fell from 77% of exports (by value) to only 15%. New resources were opened, especially copper mining in Katanga province. The British-owned Union Miniere company dominated the copper industry; it used a direct rail line to the sea at Beira. The war caused a heavy demand for copper, production soared from 997 tons in 1911 to 27,000 tons in 1917, then fell off to 19,000 tons in 1920. Smelters operated at Lubumbashi; before the war copper was sold to Germany; the British purchased all the wartime output, with the revenues going to the Belgian government in exile. Diamond and gold mining expanded during the war. The British firm of Lever Bros. greatly expanded the palm oil business during the war, and there was an increased output of cocoa, rice and cotton. New rail and steamship lines opened to handle the expanded export traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1922 |wstitle=Belgian Congo |volume=30 |page=429 |first=Frank Richardson |last=Cana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
{{main article|French entry into World War I|French Third Republic#First World War}}
Many French intellectuals welcomed the war to avenge the humiliation of defeat and loss of territory to Germany following the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1871. Only one major figure, novelist [[Romain Rolland]] retained his pacifist internationalist values; he went to Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Hanna, ''The mobilization of intellect: French scholars and writers during the Great War'' (Harvard University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; After Socialist leader [[Jean Jaurès]], a pacifist, was assassinated at the start of the war, the French socialist movement abandoned its antimilitarist positions and joined the national war effort. Prime Minister [[Rene Viviani]]  called for unity—for a "[[Union sacrée]]" ("Sacred Union"); France had few dissenters.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Greenhalgh, "Writing about France's Great War." (2005): 601-612. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30036345 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[war-weariness]] was a major factor by 1917, even reaching the army, as soldiers were reluctant to attack—many threatened to mutiny—saying it was best to wait for the arrival of millions of Americans. The soldiers were protesting not just the futility of frontal assaults in the face of German machine guns but also degraded conditions at the front lines and at home, especially infrequent leaves, poor food, the use of African and Asian colonials on the home front, and concerns about the welfare of their wives and children.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard V. Smith, "War and 'Politics': The French Army Mutinies of 1917," ''War in History,'' (April 1995) 2#2 pp&amp;nbsp;180–201&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy was hurt by the German invasion of major industrial areas in the northeast. While the occupied area in 1913 contained only 14% of France's industrial workers, it produced 58% of the steel, and 40% of the coal.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Hardach, ''The First World War: 1914–1918'' (1977) pp&amp;nbsp;87–88&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable relief came with the influx of American food, money and raw materials in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Cyrille Hautcoeur, "Was the Great War a watershed? The economics of World War I in France," in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrival of over a million American soldiers in 1918 brought heavy spending on food and construction materials. Labor shortages were in part alleviated by the use of volunteer and forced labor from the colonies.

The war damages amounted to about 113% of the GDP of 1913, chiefly the destruction of productive capital and housing. The national debt rose from 66% of GDP in 1913 to 170% in 1919, reflecting the heavy use of bond issues to pay for the war.  Inflation was severe, with the franc losing over half its value against the British pound.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Beaudry and Franck Portier, "The French depression in the 1930s." ''Review of Economic Dynamics''(2002) 5#1 pp: 73-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World War ended a golden era for the press. Their younger staff members were drafted and male replacements could not be found (women were not considered). Rail transportation was rationed and less paper and ink came in, and fewer copies could be shipped out. Inflation raised the price of newsprint, which was always in short supply. The cover price went up, circulation fell and many of the 242 dailies published outside Paris closed down. The government set up the Interministerial Press Commission to closely supervise newspapers.  A separate agency imposed tight censorship that led to blank spaces where news reports or editorials were disallowed. The dailies sometimes were limited to only two pages instead of the usual four, leading one satirical paper to try to report the war news in the same spirit:
: War News. A half-zeppelin threw half its bombs on half-time combatants, resulting in one-quarter damaged. The zeppelin, halfways-attacked by a portion of half-anti aircraft guns, was half destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;Collins, "The Business of Journalism in Provincial France during World War I," (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Clemenceau]] became prime minister in November 1917, a time of defeatism and acrimony. Italy was on the defensive, Russia had surrendered. Civilians were angry, as rations fell short and the threat of German air raids grew. Clemenceau realized his first priority was to restore civilian morale. He arrested [[Joseph Caillaux]], a former French prime minister, for openly advocating peace negotiations. He won all-party support to fight to victory calling for "la guerre jusqu'au bout" (war until the end).

==Russia==
{{Main|Russian entry into World War I|History of Russia (1892–1917)|Russian Revolution}}
Tsarist Russia was being torn apart in 1914 and was not prepared to fight a modern war.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Rogger, "Russia in 1914," ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1966) 1#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;95–119 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259893 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The industrial sector was small, finances were poor, the rural areas could barely feed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gatrell, "Poor Russia, poor show: mobilising a backward economy for war, 1914–1917," in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated military failures and bureaucratic ineptitude soon turned large segments of the population against the government. Control of the Baltic Sea by the German fleet, and of the Black Sea by combined German and Ottoman forces prevented Russia from importing supplies or exporting goods. By the middle of 1915 the impact of the war was demoralizing. Food and fuel supplies grew scarce, war casualties kept climbing and inflation was mounting. Strikes increased among low-paid factory workers, and the peasants, who wanted land reforms, were restless. Meanwhile, elite distrust of the incompetent decision making at the highest levels was deepened when a semiliterate mystic, [[Grigory Rasputin]], gained enormous influence over the Tsar and his wife until he was assassinated. Major strikes broke out early in 1917 and the army sided with the strikers in the [[February Revolution]]. The tsar abdicated. The liberal reformer [[Alexander Kerensky]] came to power in July, but in the [[October Revolution]] Lenin and the Bolsheviks took control. In early 1918 they signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that made Germany dominant in Eastern Europe, while Russia plunged into years of civil war.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Thompson, ''Revolutionary Russia, 1917'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the central bureaucracy was overwhelmed and under-led, Fallows shows that localities sprang into action motivated by patriotism, pragmatism, economic self-interest, and partisan politics. Food distribution was the main role of the largest network, called the "Union of Zemstvos." It also set up hospitals and refugee stations.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fallows, "Politics and the War Effort in Russia: The Union of Zemstvos and the Organization of the Food Supply, 1914–1916," ''Slavic Review'' (1978) 37#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;70–90 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2494907 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
{{see also|History of Italy#First World War|Italy in World War I}}
Italy decided not to honor its [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] with Germany and Austria, and remained neutral. Public opinion in Italy was sharply divided, with Catholics and socialists calling for peace. However nationalists saw their opportunity to gain their "irredenta" – that is, the border regions that were controlled by Austria. The nationalists won out, and in April 1915, the Italian government secretly agreed to the [[London Pact]] in which Britain and France promised that if Italy would declare war on Austria, it would receive its territorial rewards. The Italian army of 875,000 men was poorly led and lacked heavy artillery and machine guns. The industrial base was too small to provide adequate amounts of modern equipment, and the old-fashioned rural base did not produce much of a food surplus.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Galassi and Mark Harrison, "Italy at war, 1915–1918," in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The war stalemated with a dozen indecisive battles on a very narrow front along the [[Battles of the Isonzo|Isonzo River]], where the Austrians held the high ground. In 1916, Italy declared war on Germany, which provided significant aid to the Austrians. Some 650,000 Italian soldiers died and 950,000 were wounded, while the economy required large-scale Allied funding to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Nelson Page, ''Italy and the world war'' (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=9RUitonph38C online at Google]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the war the government had ignored labor issues, but now it had to intervene to mobilize war production. With the main working-class Socialist party reluctant to support the war effort, strikes were frequent and cooperation was minimal, especially in the Socialist strongholds of Piedmont and Lombardy. The government imposed high wage scales, as well as collective bargaining and insurance schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Tomassini, "Industrial Mobilization and the labour market in Italy during the First World War," ''Social History,'' (Jan 1991), 16#1 pp&amp;nbsp;59–87&lt;/ref&gt; Many large firms expanded dramatically. For example, the workforce at the Ansaldo munitions company grew from 6,000 to 110,000 workers as it manufactured 10,900 artillery pieces, 3,800 warplanes, 95 warships and 10 million artillery shells. At Fiat the workforce grew from 4,000 to 40,000. Inflation doubled the cost of living. Industrial wages kept pace but not wages for farm workers. Discontent was high in rural areas since so many men were taken for service, industrial jobs were unavailable, wages grew slowly and inflation was just as bad.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''European Powers in the First World War,'' p&amp;nbsp;375–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy blocked serious peace negotiations, staying in the war primarily to gain new territory. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of St. Germain]] awarded the victorious Italian nation the Southern half of the [[County of Tyrol]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]], and the city of [[Zadar]]. Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Pact of London, so this victory was considered "[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]". In 1922 Italy formally annexed the [[Dodecanese]] (''Possedimenti Italiani dell'Egeo''), that she had occupied during the previous war with Turkey.

==United States==
{{main article|United States home front during World War I|American entry into World War I|}}
President [[Woodrow Wilson]] took full control of foreign policy, declaring neutrality but warning Germany that the resumption of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] against American ships would mean war. Wilson's mediation efforts failed; likewise, the peace efforts sponsored by industrialist [[Henry Ford]] went nowhere. Germany decided to take the risk and try to win by cutting off Britain; the US declared war in April 1917. America had the largest industrial, financial and agricultural base of any of the great powers, but it took 12–18 months to fully reorient it to the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Rockoff, "Until it's over, over there: the US economy in World War I," in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch 10&lt;/ref&gt; American money, food and munitions flowed freely to Europe from spring 1917, but troops arrived slowly. The US Army in 1917 was small and poorly equipped. [[File:I-Want-U.jpg|thumb|240px|Navy poster by [[Howard Chandler Christy]]]] The draft began in spring 1917 but volunteers were also accepted. Four million men and thousands of women joined the services for the duration.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Chambers, II, ''To Raise an Army: The Draft Comes to Modern America'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; By summer 1918 American soldiers under General [[John J. Pershing]] arrived in France at the rate of 10,000 a day, while Germany was unable to replace its losses.&lt;ref&gt;Edward M. Coffman, ''The War to End All Wars: The American Military Experience in World War I'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The result was an Allied victory in November 1918.

Propaganda campaigns directed by the government shaped the public mood toward patriotism and voluntary purchases of war bonds. The [[Committee on Public Information]] (CPI) controlled war information and provide pro-war propaganda, with the assistance of the private [[American Protective League]] and tens of thousands of local speakers. The [[Sedition Act of 1918]] criminalized any expression of opinion that used "disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language" about the US government, flag or armed forces. The most prominent opponents of the war were [[Industrial Workers of the World|Wobblies]] and [[Socialist Party of America|Socialists]], many of whom were convicted of deliberately impeding the war effort and were sentenced to prison, including the Socialist presidential candidate [[Eugene Debs]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Schaffer, ''The United States in World War I''  (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodrow Wilson played the central role in defining the Allied war aims in 1917–1918 (although the US never officially joined the Allies.) He demanded Germany depose the Kaiser and accept his terms, the [[Fourteen Points]]. Wilson dominated the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] but Germany was treated harshly by the Allies in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) as Wilson put all his hopes in the new [[League of Nations]]. Wilson refused to compromise with Senate Republicans over the issue of Congressional power to declare war, and the Senate rejected the Treaty and the League.&lt;ref&gt;John Milton Cooper, ''Breaking the Heart of the World: Woodrow Wilson and the Fight for the League of Nations'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
{{main article|History of Germany during World War I| German entry into World War I }}
By 1915 the British naval blockade had cut-off food imports and conditions deteriorated rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas. The causes included the transfer of so many farmers and food workers into the military, combined with the overburdened railroad system, a shortage of coal, and the [[Blockade of Germany|British blockade]] that cut off imports from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht Ritschl, "The pity of peace: Germany's economy at war, 1914–1918 and beyond," in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. 'The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt; The winter of 1916–1917 was known as the "turnip winter" ([[:de:Steckrübenwinter]]), because that vegetable, which was usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of [[soup kitchen]]s were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even [[German Army (German Empire)|the army]] had to cut the rations for soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Chickering, ''Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914–1918'' (2004) p. 141–42&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to peacetime, about 474,000 additional civilians died, chiefly because malnutrition had weakened the body.&lt;ref&gt;N.P. Howard,  "The Social and Political Consequences of the Allied Food Blockade of Germany, 1918–19," ''German History'' (1993) 11#2 pp&amp;nbsp;161–88 [http://libcom.org/files/blockade%20Germany_0.pdf online] table p 166, with 271,000 excess deaths in 1918 and 71,000 in 1919.&lt;/ref&gt;
Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink, but using the slogan of "sharing scarcity", the German bureaucracy ran an efficient rationing system nevertheless.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Allen, "Sharing scarcity: Bread rationing and the First World War in Berlin, 1914–1923," [[Journal of Social History]], (Winter 1998) 32#2 pp&amp;nbsp;371–93 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3789666 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of October 1918 saw the outbreak of the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]] as units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost (→[[Kiel mutiny]]). By 3 November, the revolt had spread to other cities and states of the country, in many of which workers' and soldiers' councils were established (→ [[German Revolution of 1918–19]]). Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior commanders had lost confidence in Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] and his government.

The Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated. On 9 November 1918, the Social Democrat [[Philipp Scheidemann]] (1865-1939) proclaimed a Republic. On 11 November, [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|the armistice]] ended the war with a total defeat for Germany.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Ryder, ''The German Revolution of 1918: A Study of German Socialism in War and Revolt'' (1st ed. 1967 / 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Occupation of the Rhineland|Rhineland was occupied]] by the Allies (until 1923/1930);

==Austria-Hungary==
{{see also|Austro-Hungarian entry into World War I|Hungary in World War I|Austria-Hungary#World War I}}

The heavily rural Empire did have a small industrial base, but its major contribution was manpower and food.&lt;ref&gt;Max-Stephan Schulze, "Austria-Hungary's economy in World War I," in Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch 3 [https://www.library6.com/books/523600.pdf#page=95 online]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Kann, et al. eds. ''The Habsburg Empire in World War I: Essays on the Intellectual, Military, Political and Economic Aspects of the Habsburg War Effort'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; On the home front, food grew scarcer and scarcer, as did heating fuel. The hog population fell 90 percent, as the dwindling supplies of ham and bacon percent of the Army.Hungary, with its heavy agricultural base, was somewhat better fed. Morale fell every year, and the diverse nationalities gave up on the Empire and looked for ways to establish their own nation states.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Healy, ''Vienna and the Fall of the Habsburg Empire: Total War and Everyday Life in World War I'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Inflation soared, from an index of 129 in 1914 to 1589 in 1918, wiping out the cash savings of the middle-class. In terms of war damage to the economy, the war used up about 20 percent of the GDP. The dead soldiers amounted to about four percent of the 1914 labor force, and the wounded ones to another six percent. Compared all the major countries in the war, Austria's death and casualty rate was toward the high-end.&lt;ref&gt;Schulze, "Austria-Hungary's economy in World War I,"&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the German army realized it needed close cooperation from the homefront, Habsburg officers saw themselves as entirely separate from the civilian world, and superior to it. When they occupied productive areas, such as Romania, they seized food stocks and other supplies for their own purposes, and blocked any shipments intended for civilians back in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The result was that the officers lived well, as the civilians began to starve. Vienna even transferred training units to Serbia and Poland for the sole purpose of feeding them. In all, the Army obtained about 15 percent of its cereal needs from occupied territories.&lt;ref&gt;Watson,  ''Ring of Steel'' p 396-97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ottoman Empire==
{{see also|Ottoman Empire#World War I (1914–1918)|Armenian Genocide}}
The Ottoman Empire had long been the "sick man of Europe" and by 1914 it had been driven out of nearly all of Europe, and had lost its influence in North Africa. It still controlled 23 million people, of whom 17 million were in modern-day Turkey, three million in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and 2.5 million in Iraq. Another 5.5 million people were under nominal Ottoman rule in the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Şevket Pamuk, "The Ottoman Economy in World War I" in Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch 4, esp. p 112&lt;/ref&gt;

A Turkish revival movement, the [[Young Turks]] took control of the government in 1913; they mobilized the country's society for war, employing numerous political and economic reforms. The Committee of Union and Progress, through its Committee of National Defense, fostered pan-Turkish nationalism based in Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;Feroz Ahmad, "War and Society under the Young Turks, 1908–18," ''Review: A Journal of the Fernand Braudel Center,'' (1988) 11#2 pp&amp;nbsp;265–286&lt;/ref&gt; The Young Turks created new organizations, such as the Ottoman Red Crescent Society, the Ottoman Navy League, and the Committee of National Defense, to extend their political influence to the middle class, to mobilize support for the war effort and to construct a Turkish identity.&lt;ref&gt;Nadi˙r Özbek, "Defining the public sphere during the late Ottoman Empire: War, mass mobilization and the young Turk regime (1908–18)," ''Middle Eastern Studies,'' (Sept 2007) 43#5 pp&amp;nbsp;795–809&lt;/ref&gt; When the war broke out the sultan, in his capacity, as caliph, issued a jihad,&lt;ref&gt;see [https://books.google.com/books?id=WC_2AtmBOpEC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=sultan+jihad+1914+ottoman+intitle:classical+inauthor:Peters&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FE5bT8D2LvPPiAK6p9GRCw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA text of jihad]&lt;/ref&gt; calling all Muslims in Egypt, India and other Allied colonies to revolt against their Christian rulers. Very few listened.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Aksakal, "'Holy War Made in Germany'? Ottoman Origins of the 1914 Jihad," ''War in History'' (April 2011) 18#2 pp&amp;nbsp;184–199&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, many Arabs turned against the Turkish rulers of the Empire and collaborated with the British.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan Kayali, ''Arabs and Young Turks: Ottomanism, Arabism, and Islamism in the Ottoman Empire, 1908–1918'' (1997) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40241096 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to highly exaggerated fears that the Armenians were a tool of the Russians, the Young Turks forcibly evacuated the Armenians from eastern Anatolia, regardless of the 600,000 or more lives lost in the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Grigor Suny, "Truth in Telling: Reconciling Realities in the Genocide of the Ottoman Armenians," ''American Historical Review'' (2009) 114#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;930–946 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/ahr.114.4.930 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The Young Turks lost control as the war ended and fled into exile.

==Balkans==
===Serbia===
Despite its small size and population of 4.6 million, Serbia had the most effective manpower mobilization of the war, and had a highly professional officer corps. It called 350,000 men to arms, of whom 185,000 were in combat units.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Cataclysm'' p 59&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the casualties and expenditure of munitions in the Balkan Wars left Serbia depleted and dependent on France for supplies. Austria invaded twice in 1914 and was turned back after both armies suffered very heavy losses. Many captured Austrian soldiers were Slavic and joined the Serbian cause. The year 1915 was peaceful in the sense there was no military action, but food supplies were dangerously low and a series of deadly epidemics hit, especially typhus. The death toll from epidemics was about 100,000 civilians, 35,000 soldiers, and 30,000 prisoners of war.&lt;ref&gt;Dragan Zivojinovic, "Serbia and Montenegro: The Home Front" in Béla K. Király, ed. ''East Central European society in World War I'' (1985) pp&amp;nbsp;253–59 esp p 243&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1915, however, German generals were given control and invaded Serbia with Austrian and Bulgarian forces. The Serbian army hastily retreated west but only 70,000 made it through, and Serbia became an occupied land. Disease was rampant, but the Austrians were pragmatic and paid well for food supplies, so conditions were not harsh. Instead Austria tried to depoliticize Serbia, to minimize violence, and to integrate the country into the Empire. Nevertheless, Serbian nationalism remained defiant and many young men slipped out to help rebuild the Serbian army in exile.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan E. Gumz, ''The Resurrection and Collapse of Empire in Habsburg Serbia, 1914–1918'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

France proved an invaluable ally during the war and its armies, together with reorganized Serbian units, moved up from Greece in 1918 and liberated Serbia, [[Montenegro]], and [[Vojvodina]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrej Mitrovic, ''Serbia's Great War 1914–1918'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The war ended the very heavy death toll, which saw 615,000 of Serbia's 707,000 soldiers killed, along with 600,000 civilian dead. The death toll in Montenegro was also high.&lt;ref&gt;Zivojinovic, "Serbia and Montenegro: The Home Front" p 256&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia achieved its political goals by forming the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) in 1918. It proved more difficult to create the new-model "Yugoslav" as an exemplar of a united nation containing diverse ethnicities, languages and religions. For example, Montenegro was included but, fearful of losing its own cultural traditions, there was a revolt there that the Serbian army crushed.&lt;ref&gt;Zdenko Zlatar, "Nationalism in Serbia (1804–1918)," ''Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism'' (1979) Vol. 6, pp&amp;nbsp;100–113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulgaria===
{{main article|Bulgaria during World War I}}
Bulgaria, a poor rural nation of 4.5 million people, sought to acquire [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], but when it tried it suffered defeat in 1913 in the [[Second Balkan War]]. In the Great War Bulgaria at first stayed neutral. However its leaders still hoped to acquire Macedonia, which was controlled by an Ally, Serbia. In 1915, joining the Central Powers seemed the best route.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''The European powers in the First World War'' (1996). pp&amp;nbsp;149–52&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria mobilized a very large army of 800,000 men, using equipment supplied by Germany. The Bulgarian-German-Austrian invasion of Serbia in 1915 provided a quick victory, but by the end of that year Bulgaria was also fighting the British and French—as well as the Romanians in 1916 and the Greeks in 1917. Bulgaria was ill-prepared for a long war; the absence of so many soldiers sharply reduced agricultural output. Much of its best food was smuggled out to feed lucrative black-markets elsewhere. By 1918 the soldiers were not only short of basic equipment like boots, but they were being fed mostly corn bread with a little meat. Germany increasingly took control, and Bulgarian relations with its ally the Ottoman Empire soured. The Allied offensive in September 1918 destroyed the remnants of Bulgarian military power and civilian morale. Troops mutinied and peasants [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski|revolted]], demanding peace. By that month's end Bulgaria signed an armistice, giving up its conquests and its military hardware. [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|The Bulgarian Czar]] abdicated and Bulgaria's war ended. The [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]] in 1919 stripped Bulgaria of its conquests, reduced its army to 20,000 men, and demanded reparations of £100 million.&lt;ref&gt;
Richard C. Hall, "Bulgaria in the First World War," ''Historian,'' (Summer 2011) 73#2 pp&amp;nbsp;300–315 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6563.2011.00293.x/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage= online]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Constantine I.png|thumb|left|King Constantine I and Queen Sophia; she was the sister of the German Kaiser.]] --&gt;
Greece had been exhausted by the Balkan wars and sought to remain neutral, but its strategic position as the gateway to the Balkans made that impossible.&lt;ref&gt;George B. Leontaritis, ''Greece and the First World War'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[National Schism]], [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]], a traditionalist who had German ties, battled with his modernizing liberal Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who was sympathetic to the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mazower, "The Messiah and the Bourgeoisie: Venizelos and Politics in Greece, 1909–1912," ''Historical Journal'' (1992) 35#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;885–904 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2639443 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Venizélos with Allied support, set up the short-lived Greek "state" of Salonika, from October 1916 to June 1917. An Allied blockade forced the [[Noemvriana|king to abdicate in June 1917]]. Venizélos was now in full control and Greece sided with the Allies and declared war. Greece served as a staging base for large numbers of French, Serbian and other Allied units. By war's end the Greek army numbered 300,000 and had about 5,000 casualties. The schism between modernizers and traditionalists did not heal and for decades was the polarizing factor in Greek politics.

==Asia==
===China===
{{main article|History of the Republic of China}}
The warlord [[Duan Qirui]] was the most powerful leader in China. He dissolved the parliament and declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary on August 13, 1917.  Enemy nationals were detained and their assets seized.  Around 175,000 Chinese workers volunteered for well-paid positions in the [[Chinese Labour Corps|labor battalions]]  that served the Allies behind the lines in France,  and Africa and on supply ships.  Some 10,000 died, including over 500 on ships sunk by [[U-boat]]s.   No soldiers were sent overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Guoqi Xu,  ''China and the Great War: China's Pursuit of a New National Identity and Internationalization'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{main article|Japanese entry into World War I|Japan during World War I}}
Japan's military seized German possessions in the Pacific and East Asia. but there was no large-scale mobilization of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick R. Dickinson, ''War and National Reinvention: Japan in the Great War, 1914–1919'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign minister [[Kato Takaaki]] and Prime Minister [[Okuma Shigenobu]] wanted to use the opportunity to expand Japanese influence in China. They enlisted [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866–1925), then in exile in Japan, but they had little success.&lt;ref&gt;Albert A. Altman and Harold Z. Schiffrin, "Sun Yat-Sen and the Japanese, 1914–16," ''Modern Asian Studies,'' (July 1972) 6#4 pp&amp;nbsp;385–400&lt;/ref&gt; The Imperial Navy, a nearly autonomous bureaucratic institution, made its own decision to undertake expansion in the Pacific. It captured Germany's Micronesian territories north of the equator, and ruled the islands until 1921. The operation gave the navy a rationale for enlarging its budget to double the army budget and expanding the fleet. The Navy thus gained significant political influence over national and international affairs.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Schencking, "Bureaucratic Politics, Military Budgets and Japan's Southern Advance: The Imperial Navy's Seizure of German Micronesia in the First World War," ''War in History,'' (July 1998) 5#3 pp&amp;nbsp;308–326&lt;/ref&gt;

Inflation caused rice prices to quadruple, leading to small-scale riots all across the country in 1918. The government made thousands of arrests and prevented the newspapers from reporting the riots. Some 250,000 people died in the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]] epidemic in late 1918.  The death rate was much lower than other major countries because some immunity had developed from a mild outbreak earlier; public health officials successfully warned people to avoid contact; and the use of inoculation, herbals, masks, and gargling.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey W. Rice and Edwina Palmer, "Pandemic influenza in Japan, 1918–19: Mortality patterns and official responses," ''Journal of Japanese Studies,'' (Summer 1993) 19#2 pp&amp;nbsp;389–420&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Grasses]]''' are one of the most abundant floras on all continents except [[Antarctica]]. Their [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] is estimated to have taken place 200 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Wolfe1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolfe |first=H. Kenneth |authorlink= |year=1989 |title=Date of the monocot-dicot divergence estimated from chloroplast DNA sequence data |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume=86 |issue=16 |pages=6201–6205 |doi=10.1073/pnas.86.16.6201 |url=|pmid=2762323 |pmc=297805|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans have intentionally and unintentionally introduced these species to [[North America]] through travel and trade. On the North American plains, [[prairie]]s, [[grassland]]s, and [[meadow]]s at least 11% of grasses are non-native.&lt;ref name="Groom2006"&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Conservation Biology |last=Groom |first=Martha J. |authorlink= |author2=Meffe, Gary K. |author3=Carroll, C. Ronald  |year=2006 |edition=3rd |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, MA |isbn=0-87893-518-5 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; North America is considered a hotspot for many [[:Category:Invasive plant species|invasive plant species]] of grasses, which threatens all of the endangered native grass species and potentially threatens other grass species.  Conservation tactics and management policies can help prevent [[invasive species]] from taking over and driving native North American plants to extinction.

==Attributes==
Non-native grasses are classified as invasive if they have the following three attributes:
# The grass must have a pathway to be delivered to a new location, e.g. boat, shoe, animal, vehicle, feed, contaminated seed, etc.
# It is able to tolerate its new environment long enough to establish and reproduce.
# It is able to co-exist with native plants. Invasive grasses can outcompete native plants species by manipulating environmental conditions through either chemicals or other physiological factors.

These factors give an upper hand, which will allow the invader to outcompete the native plants. For example, a study conducted in the [[Mojave desert]] of [[California]] by Smith ''et al.'' in 2006, found that invasive grass species increase in areas with higher concentrations of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), especially in arid conditions which make up 20% of Earth’s terrestrial surface area.&lt;ref name="Smih2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Stanley D. |authorlink= |year=2000 |title=Elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases productivity and invasive species' success in an arid ecosystem |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=408 |issue=6808 |pages=79–82 |doi=10.1038/35040544 |url=http://www.as.wvu.edu/biology/bio463/Smith%20et%20al%202000.pdf |accessdate= |pmid=11081510 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the annual invasive grasses will outcompete the natives because they use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to their advantage.

==Impacts==
There are many impacts involving invasive grasses in North America, which range from an ecosystem level to a community level to a genetic level. Such impacts influence habitat structure, disturbance regimes, and nutrient cycling.&lt;ref name="Groom2006" /&gt;  A successful invasion of a grass may result in new hybrid species, which can have both good and bad results. A good result could be a new species. A bad result could produce a sterile species, which would eventually lead to the extinction of that grass. European [[Cheatgrass]] invading the North American prairies is an example of a disturbance regime because it burns quickly and is very susceptible to fire.&lt;ref name="Groom2006" /&gt;  As a result, it gives invasive grasses a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] in the reproduction process. Another invasive grass impact example, at the ecological level, is [[Cordgrass]] or more specifically ''[[Spartina anglica]]''. This species arose in England as an [[allotetraploid]] of two wild species and was introduced intentionally, to control erosion on the coasts of North America. It now flourishes spreading across the mudflats of the Pacific coast changing them into [[salt marsh]]es, which has tremendous effects on the fauna of the mudflats such as clams, worms, and anemones.&lt;ref name="Thompson1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thompson |first=John D. |authorlink= |year=1991 |title=The Biology of an Invasive Plant: What makes ''Spartina anglica'' so successful? |journal=BioScience |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=393–401 |doi=10.2307/1311746 |jstor= 1311746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
In order to keep North American native grasses from potentially going extinct from invasive grasses, it is important to control or better yet prevent such invasions in the first place. There are many ways to go about this such as controlling species mechanically or physically. This includes hand removal of grasses or by machine. In a five-year study conducted by Wilson ''et al.'' (2001) in Western Oregon, showed that mowing prairies of the invasive grass [[Arrhenatherum elatius]] allowed the native grasses [[Danthonia californica]] and [[Festuca roemeri]] to flourish and out compete the non-natives.&lt;ref name="Wilson2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wison |first=Mark V. |authorlink= |author2=Clark, Deborah L. |year=2001 |title=Controlling invasive Arrhenatherum elatius and Promoting Native Prairie Grasses through Mowing |journal=Applied Vegetation Science |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=129–138 |doi=10.1111/j.1654-109X.2001.tb00243.x |url=http://oregonstate.edu/~wilsomar/PDF/WC_AVS_00.pdf |accessdate= |jstor=1479045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an effective method for the control of invasive grasses but it will take many hours of hard manual labor, which could be costly. Using chemicals is an effective way to control non-natives but it is not very ecologically friendly. Chemicals such as herbicides can contaminate waterways or kill other plants in the immediate area. Biological control is the use of other organism to reduce the invader grass. This has been proven to be effective but has also ricocheted back in a negative way. Other options include using multiple approaches at the same time, for example, mowing a specific region of grass land and then using an herbicide to target the invasive. The ultimate way to control invasive grasses in North America is to prevent them from entering in the first place. The first step of this prevention is identifying and regulating the grasses' pathway. After that it needs government assessment and policies to see that these pathways are blocked or regulated.

The '''Jackal's Horn''' is a boney cone-shaped excrescence which can occasionally grow on the skulls of [[golden jackal]]s. It is associated with magical powers in [[South Asia]]. This horn usually measures half an inch in length, and is concealed by fur. 

In the 1800s, the natives of [[Sri Lanka]] called this growth ''narric-comboo'', and both [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Sinhalese people]] traditionally believe it to be a potent [[amulet]] which can grant wishes and reappear to its owner at its own accord when lost. Some Sinhalese believe that the horn can grant the holder invulnerability in any [[lawsuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tennent|first1=Sir James Emerson||title=Sketches of the natural history of Ceylon|publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts|edition=|year=1861|pages=36–37|isbn=|url={{Google books|plainurl=yes|id=qxw3AQAAMAAJ|page=36}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to healers and witch doctors in [[Nepal]], a jackal horn can be used to win in [[gambling]] bouts, and ward off evil spirits. The [[Tharu people]] of [[Bardia (Nepal)]] believe that jackal horns are retractible, and only protrude when jackals howl in chorus. A hunter who manages to extract the horn will place it in a silver casket of [[vermilion]] powder, which is thought to give the object sustenance. The Tharu believe that the horn can grant the owner the ability to see in the dark and seduce women.&lt;ref&gt;''Mammals of Nepal: (with reference to those of Pakiatan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and India)'' by Tej Kumar Shrestha, published by Steven Simpson Books, 1997, {{ISBN|0-9524390-6-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some areas, the horn is called ''Seear Singhi'' or "Geedhar Singhi" the word "Geedhar" is the [[Urdu]] translation of Jackle and (the [[root word]]s being the [[Persian language|Persian]] "seah" meaning black, and "Singh" which means horn in Hindi and Urdu) and is tied to the necks of children. The horn is sometimes traded by [[low caste]] people, though it is thought that they are in fact pieces of deer antlers sold to the credulous.&lt;ref&gt;''Oral tradition from the Indus International folklore'' by John Frederick Adolphus McNair, Thomas Lambert Barlow, published by Ayer Publishing, 1977, {{ISBN|0-405-10108-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Bengal]], it is believed that when placed within a [[safe]], jackal horns can increase the amount of money within three-fold. Some criminal elements of the Bengal [[Sansi people|Sansi]] will use fake jackal horns to lull unwitting people into trusting them, and will offer to place these horns into their victim's safe in order to discover its location.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Indian tribes'' by Padma Shri S.S.

[[File:Jain Vegetarianism Illustration.jpg|thumb|The food choices of Jains are based on the value of Ahimsa (non-violence), and this makes the Jains to prefer food that inflict the least amount of violence]]
{{Jainism}}
{{Indian cuisine}}
'''Jain vegetarianism''' is practiced by the followers of [[Jainism|Jain]] culture and philosophy. It is one of the most rigorous forms of spiritually motivated diet on the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The Jain cuisine is completely [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] and also excludes underground vegetables such as onion, garlic, etc, to prevent injuring small insects and microorganisms; and also to prevent the entire plant getting uprooted and killed. It is practised by Jain ascetics and lay Jains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://thoughtsfromajoy.wordpress.com/2012/01/25/vegetarian-garam-masala-recipe/
|title=An eggplant (aubergine) dish that’s fit for a king!
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=249}}

Jain objections to the eating of meat, fish and eggs are based on the principle of [[non-violence]] ([[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]], figuratively "non-injuring"). Every act by which a person directly or indirectly supports killing or injury is seen as act of violence (''himsa''), which creates harmful reaction [[karma]]. The aim of ahimsa is to prevent the accumulation of such karma.{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|pp=26-30}}{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|pp=191-195}} The extent to which this intention is put into effect varies greatly among Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. Jains believe nonviolence is the most essential religious duty for everyone (''ahinsā paramo dharmaḥ'', a statement often inscribed on Jain temples).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}}{{sfn|Wiley|2006|p=438}}{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|pp=153-154}} It is an indispensable condition for liberation from the cycle of [[reincarnation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hemacandra]], ''Yogashastra'' 2.31.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the ultimate goal of all Jain activities. Jains share this goal with Hindus and Buddhists, but their approach is particularly rigorous and comprehensive. Their scrupulous and thorough way of applying nonviolence to everyday activities, and especially to food, shapes their entire lives and is the most significant hallmark of Jain identity.{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|pp=154-160}}{{sfn|Jindal|1988|p=74-90}}{{sfn|Tähtinen|1976|p=110}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=176-177}} A side effect of this strict discipline is the exercise of [[asceticism]], which is strongly encouraged in Jainism for lay people as well as for monks and nuns.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=187-192}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=199-200}}{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|pp=153-159}} Out of the five types of living beings, a householder is forbidden to kill, or destroy, intentionally, all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, cereals, etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch).{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=79}}

==Practice==
*For Jains, [[lacto-vegetarianism]] is mandatory. Food is restricted to that originating from plants, since plants have only one sense ('ekindriya') and are the least developed form of life, and dairy products. Food that contains even the smallest particles of the bodies of dead animals or eggs is unacceptable.{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|pp=166-169}}{{sfn|Tähtinen|1976|p=37}} Some Jain scholars and activists support [[veganism]], as the modern commercialised production of dairy products is perceived to involve violence against cows. In ancient times, dairy animals were well cared for and not killed. According to Jain texts, a ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvaka]]'' (householder) shouldn't consume the four ''maha-vigai'' (the four perversions) - wine, flesh, butter and honey; and the five ''udumbara'' fruits (the five udumbara trees are Gular, Anjeera, Banyan, Peepal, and Pakar, all belonging to the fig class).{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=44}}&lt;ref name=ndtv0417&gt;{{citation |title=Mahavir Jayanti 2017: A beginner's  a guide to Jain food |url=http://m.food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/mahavir-jayanti-2017-a-beginners-guide-to-jain-food-1679071 |work=[[NDTV]] |date=9 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other tiny animals,{{sfn|Jindal|1988|p=89}}{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|p=54}}{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|pp=154-155}}{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|p=180}} because they believe that harm caused by carelessness is as reprehensible as harm caused by deliberate action.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrakrtangasutram 1.8.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uttaradhyayanasutra 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tattvarthasutra 7.8&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=161-162}}{{sfn|Granoff|1992|pp=32-35}} Hence they take great pains to make sure that no minuscule animals are injured by the preparation of their meals and in the process of eating and drinking.{{sfn|Sangave|1980|pp=260-261}}{{sfn|Tähtinen|1976|p=109}}
*Traditionally Jains have been prohibited from drinking unfiltered water. In the past, when [[stepwell]]s were used for the water source, the cloth used for filtering was reversed, and some filtered water poured over it to return the organisms to the original body of water. This practice of ''jivani'' or ''bilchavani'' is no longer possible because of the use of pipes for water supply. Modern Jains may also filter tap water in the traditional fashion and a few continue to follow the filtering process even with commercial mineral or bottled drinking water.
*Jains make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Jains only accept such violence inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants.{{sfn|Lodha|1990|pp=137-141}}{{sfn|Tähtinen|1976|p=105}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=106}} Strict Jains don’t eat [[list of root vegetables|root vegetables]] such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers, because such root vegetables are considered ''ananthkay''.&lt;ref name=ndtv0417/&gt; Ananthkay means one body, but containing infinite lives. A root vegetable such as potato, though from the looks of it is one article, is said to contain infinite lives in it. Also, tiny life forms are injured when the plant is pulled up and because the bulb is seen as a living being, as it is able to sprout.{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|pp=156-157}}{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|pp=167-170}}{{sfn|Sangave|1980|p=260}} Also, consumption of most root vegetables involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, whereas consumption of most terrestrial vegetables doesn't kill the plant (it lives on after plucking the vegetables or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Green vegetables and fruits contain uncountable, but not infinite, lives. Dry beans, lentils, cereals, nuts and seeds contain a countable number of lives and their consumption results in the least destruction of life. 
* Mushrooms, fungus and yeasts are forbidden because they grow in non-hygienic environments and may harbour other life forms.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
*Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hemacandra]]: ''Yogashastra'' 3.37&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Laidlaw|1995|pp=166-167}}{{sfn|Tähtinen|1976|p=109}}
*Jain texts declare that a ''śrāvaka'' (householder) shouldn't cook or eat at night. According to Acharya Amritchandra's [[Purushartha Siddhyupaya]]:
{{quote|And, how can one who eats food without the light of the sun, albeit a lamp may have been lighted, avoid ''hiṃsā'' of minute beings which get into food?|''Puruşārthasiddhyupāya'' (133){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=86}}}}
*Strict Jains do not consume food that has been stored overnight, as it possesses a higher concentration of micro-organisms (for example, bacteria, yeast etc.) as compared to food prepared and consumed the same day. Hence, they do not consume [[yoghurt]] or [[dhokla]] and [[idli]] batter unless they have been freshly set on the same day.
*During certain days of the month and on important religious days such as [[Paryushana]] and 'Ayambil', strict Jains avoid eating green leafy vegetables along with the usual restrictions on root vegetables. Even with these restrictions, Jains have developed a wide-ranging cuisine. Apart from the regular vegetables, plain yeastless fresh bread, lentils and rice (''dal chawal - roti''), Jains prepare various delicacies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yourvegrecipe.com/jain-recipes-paryushan|title=The Ultimate Guide to Jain Recipes for Paryushan - Your Veg Recipe|website=yourvegrecipe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jains do not consume fermented foods (beer, wine and other alcohols) to avoid killing of a large number of microorganisms associated with the fermenting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mahavir Jayanti 2015: The importance of a Satvik meal |url=http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/mahavir-jayanti-2015-the-importance-of-a-satvik-meal-751655 |work=[[NDTV]] |date=2 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404075153/http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/mahavir-jayanti-2015-the-importance-of-a-satvik-meal-751655 |archivedate=4 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Puruṣārthasiddhyupāya'':
{{quote|Wine deludes the mind and a deluded person tends to forget piety; the person who forgets piety commits ''hiṃsā'' without hesitation.|''[[Puruşārthasiddhyupāya]]'' (62){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=45}} }}

==Influence on vegetarian cuisines in India==
The vegetarian cuisines of some regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]] have been strongly influenced by Jainism. These include
* [[Gujarati Jain]] cuisine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/06/30/stories/2004063000290400.htm |title=Catering to Jain palate |publisher=The Hindu |date=2004-06-30 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marwari Jain]] cuisine of Rajasthan
* [[Bundelkhandi Jain]] cuisine of central India
* [[Agrawal Jain]] cuisine of Delhi/UP
* [[Marathi Jain]] cuisine of South Maharashtra
* [[Jain Bunt]] cuisine of Karnataka
* [[Kannada Jains]] cuisine of Karnataka
* [[Tamil Jain]]s cuisine of Northern Districts of Tamil Nadu.

In India, vegetarian food is considered appropriate for everyone for all occasions. This makes vegetarian restaurants quite popular. Many vegetarian restaurants and Mishtanna sweet-shops – for example, the legendary [[Ghantewala]] sweets of [[Delhi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/11/07/stories/2002110700040300.htm |title=A royal treat in Chandni Chowk |work=Hinduonnet.com |date=7 November 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jamna Mithya in [[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Sagar]] – are run by Jains.

Some restaurants in India serve Jain versions of vegetarian dishes that leave out carrots, potatoes, onions and garlic. A few airlines serve Jain vegetarian dishes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happycow.net/travel/air_travel.html |title=Air Travel Vegetarian Style |work=Happycow.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon prior request.
Strict Jain cuisine excludes other root vegetables like carrots, beetroot, potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tarladalal.com/ViewContributedRecipe.asp?Id=25 |title=Jain recipes |work=Tarladalal.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
When [[Mahavira]] revived and reorganized the Jain community in the 6th century BCE, ''ahimsa'' was already an established, strictly observed rule.{{sfn|Goyal|1987|pp=83-85}}{{sfn|Chatterjee|2000|p=14}} [[Parshvanatha]], a [[tirthankara]] whom modern Western historians consider a historical figure,{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=19, 30}}{{sfn|Tähtinen|1976|p=132}} lived in about the 8th century BCE{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=30}}{{sfn|Chatterjee|2000|p=15}} and founded a community to which Mahavira’s parents belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Acaranga Sutra]] 2.15&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chatterjee|2000|pp=20-21}} Parshvanatha’s followers vowed to observe ''ahimsa''; this obligation was part of their ''caujjama dhamma'' (Fourfold Restraint).&lt;ref&gt;[[Sthananga Sutra]] 266&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Goyal|1987|pp=83-84}}{{sfn|Goyal|1987|p=103}}{{sfn|Tähtinen|1976|p=132}}

In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains criticized Buddhists and followers of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] or Hindus for negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of [[ahimsa]]. In particular, they strongly objected to the Vedic tradition of [[animal sacrifice]] with subsequent meat-eating, and to hunting.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=160}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=234}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=241}}{{sfn|Wiley|2006|p=448}}{{sfn|Granoff|1992|pp=1-43}}{{sfn|Tähtinen|1976|pp=8-9}}

According to the famous Tamil classic, [[Tirukkuṛaḷ]], which is also considered a Jain work by some scholars:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the world did not purchase and consume meat, no one would slaughter and offer meat for sale. (Kural 256){{sfn|Tiruvaḷḷuvar|2000}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some Brahmins—[[Kashmiri Pandit]]s, [[Bengali Brahmins]] and [[Saraswat Brahmin]]s—have traditionally eaten meat (primarily seafood). However, in regions with strong Jain influence such as [[Rajasthan]] and [[Gujarat]], or strong Jain influence in the past such as [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], Brahmins are strict vegetarians.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak has described Jainism as the originator of ahimsa.  He wrote in a letter:&lt;blockquote&gt;In ancient times, innumerable animals were butchered in sacrifices. Evidence in support of this is found in various poetic compositions such as the Meghaduta. But the credit for the disappearance of this terrible massacre from the Brahminical religion goes to Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;Bombay Samachar, Mumbai:10 Dec, 1904&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some scholars claim that ancient Jain ascetics accepted meat as alms if the animal had not been specifically killed for them.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=177}}{{sfn|Alsdorf|1962|pp=564-570}}{{sfn|Jagdishchandra Jain|1984|p=171}} If this is correct, then they applied the same standard as early Buddhists. Some passages in two of the earliest [[Śvētāmbara]] texts, the ''[[Acaranga Sutra]]'' and the ''Dasaveyaliya'', have been interpreted as regulations for specific types of meat and bones which were considered acceptable alms.&lt;ref&gt;Acaranga Sutra 2.1.10.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dasaveyaliya 5.1.73 and 5.1.84-86.&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be interpreted as references to fruits and seeds. Medieval Jain commentators on these passages interpreted them in the literal sense, but also mentioned the opinion that the offensive words had different meanings, some of which did not refer to animals and hence were compatible with vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Shilanka in his commentary on the ''Acaranga Sutra'' (completed in 872 CE; non-vegetarian interpretation), [[Haribhadra]] in his commentary on the ''Dasaveyaliya'' (8th century CE; both interpretations), Abhayadeva in his commentary on the ''Viyahapannatti'' (11th century CE; both interpretations)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Alsdorf|1962|pp=566-568}}{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|pp=171-172}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=177}} Modern Jains, who are strict vegetarians or, to the least, lacto-vegetarians, prefer the latter interpretation of these scholars on this matter.{{sfn|Alsdorf|1962|p=564}}{{sfn|Alsdorf|1962|pp=568-569}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource

'''Juglone''', also called '''5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthalenedione''' ([[IUPAC]]) is an [[organic compound]] with the [[molecular formula]] C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  In the food industry, juglone is also known as '''C.I. Natural Brown 7''' and '''C.I. 75500'''.   It is insoluble in benzene but soluble in [[dioxane]], from which it crystallizes as yellow needles. It is an [[isomer]] of [[lawsone]], which is the staining compound in the [[henna]] leaf.

Juglone occurs naturally in the leaves, roots, husks, fruit ([[fruit anatomy|the epicarp]]), and bark of plants in the [[Juglandaceae]] family, particularly the [[Juglans nigra|black walnut]] (''Juglans nigra''), and is toxic or growth-stunting to many types of plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/hortcult/fruits/blkwalnt.htm Juglone toxicity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212041801/http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/hortcult/fruits/blkwalnt.htm |date=2015-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used as an [[herbicide]], as a [[dye]] for cloth and [[ink]]s, and as a coloring agent for foods and [[cosmetics]].

==History==
The harmful effects of [[walnut]] trees on other plants have been observed for at least two millennia. The ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome used the walnut for its [[cytotoxic]] properties as did residents of the American South for easily gathering fish when they threw cut husks into the water with the fish.&lt;ref name="soderquist2"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1973|title=Juglone and allelopathy|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=50|issue=11|pages=782–3|bibcode=1973JChEd..50..782S|doi=10.1021/ed050p782|pmid=4747927|last1=Soderquist|first1=Charles J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, juglone was not isolated until the 1850s. Two men, A. Vogel Jr. and C. Reischauer, were able to isolate the compound from the walnut tree in 1851. The compound was known as nucin at that time. Juglone was then synthesized and characterized for the first time in 1887 by A. Bernthsen and A. Semper.

While at the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station in 1921, M.T. Cook found that tomato plants in the vicinity of ''Juglans nigra'' were negatively affected, most notably by their wilted leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=M.T.|date=1921|title=Wilting caused by walnut trees|url=|journal=Phytopathology|volume=11|pages=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schneiderhan found that ''Juglans nigra'' and ''Juglans cinerea'' were damaging apple trees in Virginia. The trees that were within an average of 11.9 meters from the walnut trees were found dead. All damaged trees in their vicinity average about 14.3 meters away. In addition, he found that certain local variations of the apple trees tended to be more resistant to the walnuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schneiderhan|first=F.J.|date=1926|title=Apple disease studies in northern Virginia|url=|journal=Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin|volume=245|pages=1–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A.B. Massey observed that the walnut trees in alfalfa fields caused the alfalfa to die away in place of grass. After several other experiments, Massey concluded that the toxic compound found in walnut trees was not easily soluble in water, so the compound in the roots and bark must change chemically after it leaves the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=A.B.|date=1928|title=Are nut trees poisonous to other trees and plants?|url=|journal=Flower Grower|volume=15|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1928 the compound was identified and confirmed to be [[toxic]] to other plants by E.F. Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C-nPBYjDAjYC&amp;pg=PA295&amp;lpg=PA295&amp;dq=massey+are+nut+trees+poisonous#v=onepage&amp;q=juglone&amp;f=false|title=The History of Allelopathy|last=Willis|first=Rick J.|date=2007-10-12|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402040931|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the scientific news of the harm walnut trees caused certain crops and trees, there was backlash from the scientific community to refute these findings. On one account, A.G. Miller claimed that the trees that Schneiderhan observed to be harming the apple trees in Virginia were not in fact walnut trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=A.G.|date=1926|title=Walnuts and apples|url=|journal=Farm Journal|volume=1926 (July)|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1942, B.I. Brown showed that tomato and alfalfa germination and seedling growth was slowed down by being in contact with pieces of walnut roots, adding further scientific evidence to the biological damage of juglone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=B.I.|date=1942|title=Injurious influence of bark of black walnut on seedlings of tomato and alfalfa|url=|journal=North Nut Growers Association Annual Report|volume=33|pages=97–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The walnut tree has historically been used within the field of [[traditional medicine]]. In America during the early 1900s, doctors prescribed juglone for the treatment of various [[skin diseases]].&lt;ref name="strugstad2"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2012|title=A Summary of Extraction, Synthesis, Properties, and Potential Uses of Juglone: A Literature Review|journal=Journal of Ecosystems and Management|volume=13|issue=3|pages=72–82|author=M. Strugstad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==

===Synthesis===
Juglone is derived by oxidation of the nontoxic hydrojuglone, [[1,5-Dihydroxynaphthalene|1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene]], after enzymatic hydrolysis.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Gerald Booth "Naphthalene Derivatives" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a17_009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be also be obtained by oxidations of 5,8-dihydroxy-1-tetralone with [[silver(I) oxide|silver oxide]] (Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[manganese dioxide]] (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or  [[2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone]] (DDQ).&lt;ref name=khalafy&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. Khalafy |author2=J.M. Bruce | date = 2002 | title = Oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-tetralones: Synthesis of juglone, naphthazarin, and α-hydroxyanthraquinones | journal = Journal of Sciences, Islamic Republic of Iran | volume =13 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extraction===
Juglone has been extracted from the husk of [[walnut]] fruit of which it contains 2-4% by fresh weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Combes|first1=M. R.|title=Bulletin de la Société chimique de France|journal=Combes, Bull. Soc. Chim.|date=1907|volume=1|issue=4|pages=800–816|url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletindelasoc181frangoog#page/n810/mode/2up|accessdate=14 October 2016|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cosmulescu|first1=Sina Niculina|last2=Trandafir|first2=Ion|last3=Achim|first3=Gheorghe|last4=Botu|first4=Mihai|last5=Baciu|first5=Adrian|last6=Gruia|first6=Marius|title=Phenolics of Green Husk in Mature Walnut Fruits|journal=Notulae Botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca|date=15 June 2010|volume=38|issue=1|pages=53–56|doi=10.15835/nbha3814624|url=http://www.notulaebotanicae.ro/index.php/nbha/article/view/4624|accessdate=11 October 2016|language=en|issn=1842-4309|doi-broken-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Degradation ===
Before oxidization, juglone exists in plants such as walnuts in the form of colorless [[hydroxyjuglone]], with both O groups replaced with OH groups.  This is rapidly oxidized to juglone once exposed to air.  The evidence that hydroxyjuglone is readily degraded is most apparent in the color change of walnut hulls from yellow to black after being freshly cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gries|first=G.A.|date=1943|title=Juglone - the active agent in walnut toxicity|url=|journal=Northern Nut Growers Association Annual Report|volume=34|pages=52–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Indigenous bacteria found in the soil of black walnut roots, most notably ''[[Pseudomonas putida]]'' J1, are able to metabolize juglone and use it as their primary source of energy and carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=S.K.|date=1988|title=Degradation of juglone by soil bacteria|url=|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|volume=14|issue=7|pages=1561–1571|doi=10.1007/bf01012522|pmid=24276429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, juglone is not so active as a cytotoxin in well-aerated soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=R.F.|date=1987|title=Juglone inhibits pine growth under certain moisture regimes|url=|journal=Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J.|volume=42|pages=801–803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological effects==
Juglone is an [[allelopathy|allelopathic]] compound, a substance that is produced by a plant to stunt the growth of another. The [[germination]] process of plants is less affected by the compound than the growth of the root and stem systems. In below average concentrations, it has actually increased the rate of germination in some [[coniferous]] seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rietveld|first=W J|date=1983|title=Allelopathic effects of juglone on germination and growth of several herbaceous and woody species|url=|journal=J. Chem. Ecol.|volume=9|issue=2|pages=295–308|doi=10.1007/bf00988047|pmid=24407348|citeseerx=10.1.1.550.5739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juglone exerts its effect by [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibiting]] certain [[enzyme]]s needed for metabolic function. This in turn inhibits the effects of respiration of mitochondria and inhibits photosynthesis found in common crops such as [[maize]] and [[Soybean|soy]] at juglone concentrations that are at or below those common in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koeppe|first=D.E.|date=1972|title=Some reactions of isolated corn mitochondria influenced by juglone|url=|journal=Physiol. Plant.|volume=27|pages=89–94|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.1972.tb08573.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hejl|first=A.M.|last2=Einhellig|first2=F.A.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=J.A.|date=1993|title=Effects of juglone on growth, photosynthesis, and respiration|url=|journal=J. Chem. Ecol.|volume=19|issue=3|pages=559–568|doi=10.1007/bf00994325|pmid=24248956}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these inhibitions, juglone has been shown to alter the relationship between plants and water because of its effect on [[stoma]]tal functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Einhelling F.A. 1986 Mechanisms and modes of action of allelochemicals. ''In The Science of Allelopathy.'' Eds. A R Putnam and C S Tang. pp 171–188. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in popularity of [[Agroforestry#Alley_cropping|alley cropping]] with black walnut trees and maize in the temperate Midwest, due to the high value of black walnut trees, has led to certain studies being conducted about the particular relationship between the two species. Research has shown that juglone affects the yield of maize crops; however, the practice of [[pruning]] and usage of [[root barrier]]s greatly reduce these effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225979920|title=Allelopathy in black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) alley cropping. I. Spatio-temporal variation in soil juglone in a black walnut-corn (Zea mays L.) alley cropping system in the midwestern USA (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of plants and trees are resistant to juglone including some species of [[maple]] (''Acer''), [[birch]] (''Betula''), and [[beech]] (''Fagus'').

It is highly toxic to many insect herbivores. However, some of them, example ''[[Actias luna]]'' (Luna moth), are capable of detoxification of juglone (and related naphthoquinones) to non-toxic 1,4,5-trihydroxy[[naphthalene]]. It has also shown [[anthelmintic]] (expelling parasitic worms) activity on mature and immature ''Hymenolepis nana'' in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dama L.B. |author2=Jadhav B.V. | date = 1997 | title = Anthelmintic effect of Juglone on mature and Immature Hymenolepis nana in mice | journal = Riv.

==Uses==
Juglone is occasionally used as a [[herbicide]]. Traditionally, juglone has been used as a natural dye for clothing and fabrics, particularly [[wool]], and as ink.  Because of its tendency to create dark orange-brown stains, juglone has also found use as a coloring agent for foods and cosmetics, such as [[hair dyes]].

Juglone is currently being studied for its anticancer properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19726363 | volume=29 | issue=6 | title=Effect of juglone on the ultrastructure of human liver cancer BEL-7402 cells | date=Jun 2009 | journal=Nan Fang Yi Ke da Xue Xue Bao | pages=1208–11|url=http://xuebao.jlu.edu.cn/yxb/EN/abstract/abstract4445.shtml| author1=Chen | first1=L | last2=Na-Shun | first2=B.

===Spectral data===
The spectral data for juglone confirms its bicyclic structure which contains a hydroxyl group as well as two carbonyl groups. The IR for juglone shows peaks at 3400&amp;nbsp;cm-1, 1662&amp;nbsp;cm-1, and 1641&amp;nbsp;cm-1 which are characteristic of the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups.&lt;ref name=suchard&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tet.2005.11.021| title = Photooxygenations of 1-naphthols: An environmentally friendly access to 1,4-naphthoquinones| journal = Tetrahedron| volume = 62| issue = 7| pages = 1467| year = 2006| last1 = Suchard| first1 = Oliver| last2 = Kane| first2 = Ronan| last3 = Roe| first3 = Bernard J.| last4 = Zimmermann| first4 = Elmar| last5 = Jung| first5 = Christian| last6 = Waske| first6 = Prashant A.| last7 = Mattay| first7 = Jochen| last8 = Oelgemöller| first8 = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR shows 10 peaks indicating the correct number of unique carbon atoms in the molecule as well as peaks at 160.6 ppm, 183.2 ppm, and 189.3 ppm for the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group and the two carbons part of the two carbonyl groups.&lt;ref name="suchard"/&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H n.m.r (300 MHz) δ 6.96 (s, H-2 + H-3), 7.26 (m, H-6), 7.62 (m, H-7+H-8), 11.91 (s; 5-OH); ν&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (film) 3065 b, 1665 s, 1594 m, 1451s, 1363 s, 1290 vs, 1226 s cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; and m/z (EI) 176[(M + 2)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, 10.8], 174 (M+, 100), 173 (21.9), 146 (15.9), 120 (29.6), 118 (48.8), 92 (31.4).--&gt;&lt;ref name=khalafy/&gt;

The following is a '''list of tropical cyclones that affected the U.S. state of Delaware'''. Since reliable records began, no [[tropical cyclone]] has struck the state while maintaining [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|hurricane intensity]], and only two storms since 1851 caused hurricane-force winds in the state.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;&lt;ref name="climo"&gt;{{cite web|author=Blake, Rappaport, Jarrell, &amp; Landsea|year=2005|title=Frequently Requested Hurricane Facts|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2006-07-23|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/dcmifinal2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state often experiences the direct effects of landfalling [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone]]s and from the remnants of some [[Pacific hurricane|Pacific storms]], such as rainfall or strong winds, as well as the effects of storms that remain offshore, such as rip currents or heavy surf. Since 1749, at least 111&amp;nbsp;tropical cyclones, some of which had become [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]], have affected the state, including 21 which passed over the state.

*September 17, 2003- '''[[Hurricane Isabel]]''' passes to the southwest of the state as it makes landfall on [[North Carolina]]. In the days preceding its landfall, Isabel produces strong waves, and upon striking land, the storm causes a 5-foot (1.5&amp;nbsp;m) storm surge along the Delaware coast. The waves and surge result in beach erosion and overwash.

[[Local Nature Reserve]]s (LNRs) are designated by local authorities under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]]. The local authority must have a legal control over the site, by owning or leasing it or having an agreement with the owner.

For these animals, there is documented evidence of [[homosexual behavior in animals|homosexual]] behavior of one or more of the following kinds: [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[courtship]], [[affection]], [[pair bond]]ing, or [[parenting]], as noted in researcher and author [[Bruce Bagemihl]]'s 1999 book ''Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity''.

Bagemihl writes that the presence of [[same-sex sexual behavior]] was not "officially" observed on a large scale until the 1990s due to possible [[Observer-expectancy effect|observer bias]] caused by social attitudes towards [[LGBT]] people, making the homosexual theme [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years "&gt;Bagemihl (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"&gt;News-medical.net (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Bagemihl devotes three chapters; ''Two Hundred Years at Looking at Homosexual Wildlife'', ''Explaining (Away) Animal Homosexuality'' and ''Not For Breeding Only'' in his 1999 book ''Biological Exuberance'' to the "documentation of systematic [[prejudice]]s" where he notes "the ''present ignorance'' of [[biology]] lies precisely in its single-minded attempt to find reproductive (or other) 'explanations' for homosexuality, transgender, and [[procreate|non-procreative]] and alternative [[heterosexual]]ities."&lt;ref name="Not For Breeding Only "&gt;Bagemihl (1999) page 213&lt;/ref&gt; Petter Bøckman, academic adviser for the ''[[Against Nature?]]'' exhibit stated "[M]any researchers have described homosexuality as something altogether different from sex. They must realize that animals can have sex with who they will, when they will and without consideration to a researcher's [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethical]] [[principle]]s." Homosexual behavior is found amongst social [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, particularly the sea mammals and the [[primates]].&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"/&gt;

[[Animal sexual behavior]] takes many different forms, even within the same [[species]] and the motivations for and implications of their behaviors have yet to be fully understood. Bagemihl's research shows that homosexual behavior, not necessarily [[sex]], has been documented in about 500 species as of 1999, ranging from [[primates]] to [[Acanthocephala|gut worms]].&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years "/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biological Exuberance: Animal"&gt;Harrold (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality in animals]] is seen as controversial by [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] because it asserts the naturalness of [[Human sexuality|homosexuality in humans]], while others counter that it has no implications and is nonsensical to equate natural animal behaviors to [[morality]].&lt;ref name="The Animal Homosexuality Myth"&gt;Solimeo (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defending A Higher Law"&gt;Solimeo (2004b)&lt;/ref&gt; Animal preference and motivation is always inferred from behavior. Thus homosexual behavior has been given a number of terms over the years. The correct usage of the term ''homosexual'' is that an animal ''exhibits homosexual behavior'', however this article conforms to the usage by modern research,&lt;ref&gt;Bagemihl (1999) pages 122-166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden (2004) pp.13-183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasey (1995) pages 173-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommer &amp; Vasey (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; applying the term ''homosexuality'' to all sexual behavior ([[copulation]], [[genital stimulation]], [[mating|mating games]] and sexual [[Display (zoology)|display behavior]]) between animals of the same sex.

[[Image:Cnemidophorus-ThreeSpecies.jpg|thumb|Three species of ''[[Aspidoscelis]]''.]]
The all-female [[Whiptail lizard]] species ''[[Aspidoscelis neomexicanus]]'' (center), which reproduces via [[parthenogenesis]], is shown flanked by two sexual species having males, ''[[Aspidoscelis inornatus|A. inornatus]]'' (left) and ''[[Aspidoscelis tigris|A. tigris]]'' (right). Research has shown that simulated mating behavior increases fertility for ''Aspidoscelis neomexicanus''. One female lies on top of another, playing the role of the male, the lizard that was on bottom has larger eggs, in most cases. The lizards switch off this role each mating season.&lt;ref&gt;LeVay, (19 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Male [[homosexuality]] has been inferred in several species of [[dragonflies]]. A survey of damsel and dragonflies reveals characteristic [[cloacal]] pincher mating damage in 20–80 percent of the males, indicating a fairly high occurrence of sexual [[coupling]] between males.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkle (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Utzeri (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14075">Although many people have a fear of [[mushroom poisoning]] by "[[toadstool]]s", only a small number of the many macroscopic fruiting bodies commonly known as mushrooms and toadstools have proven fatal to humans.

This list is not exhaustive and does not contain many fungi that, although not deadly, are still harmful. For a less detailed list on fungi that include non-deadly poisonous species, see [[List of poisonous fungi]].

[[File:Riodelaplatabasinmap.png|thumb|right|350px|Map showing the Río de la Plata drainage basin and major tributaries]]
This is a '''list of [[tributaries]] of the [[Río de la Plata]]''', or rivers of the [[La Plata Basin]]. Tributaries and sub-tributaries are hierarchically listed in order from the mouth of the [[Río de la Plata]] upriver. The terms "right" and "left" indicate on which side of the main stem river a tributary is located, from the perspective of looking downriver, following standard [[Tributary#Terminology|river bank terminology usage]]. Countries are identified in abbreviated form: AR for [[Argentina]], UY for [[Uruguay]], PY or PA for [[Paraguay]], BR for [[Brazil]], and BO for [[Bolivia]]. Major dams are also noted.

The '''lunar maria''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|i|ə}} (singular: '''mare''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|eɪ}})&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Science Dictionary,'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; are large, dark, [[basalt]]ic plains on [[Earth]]'s [[Moon]], formed by ancient [[volcanic]] eruptions. They were dubbed ''maria'', [[Latin]] for "seas", by early astronomers who mistook them for actual [[sea]]s. &lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, Metamorphoses 1.3&lt;/ref&gt; They are less [[albedo|reflective]] than the "highlands" as a result of their iron-rich composition, and hence appear dark to the [[naked eye]]. The maria cover about 16% of the lunar surface, mostly on the [[Near side of the Moon|side visible from Earth]]. The few maria on the [[Far side of the Moon|far side]] are much smaller, residing mostly in very large craters. The traditional nomenclature for the Moon also includes one ''oceanus'' (ocean), as well as features with the names ''lacus'' (lake), ''palus'' (marsh), and ''sinus'' (bay). The last three are smaller than maria, but have the same nature and characteristics.

The names of maria refer to sea features (Humorum, Imbrium, Insularum, Nubium, Spumans, Undarum, Vaporum, Procellarum, Frigoris), sea attributes (Australe, Orientale, Cognitum, Marginis), or states of mind (Crisium, Ingenii, Serenitatis, Tranquillitatis). [[Mare Humboldtianum]] and [[Mare Smythii]] were established before the final nomenclature, that of states of mind, was accepted, and do not follow this pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1961_French.pdf|title=XIth General Assembly|year=1961|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|language=French, English|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mare Moscoviense]] was discovered by the [[Luna 3]], and the name was proposed by the Soviet Union, it was only accepted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] with the justification that Moscow is the state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=22 August 2012|title=The name game|journal=[[Nature Magazine]]|volume=488|page=429|doi=10.1038/488429b|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7412/full/488429b.html|bibcode=2012Natur.488R.429.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ages==
The ages of the mare basalts have been determined both by direct [[radiometric dating]] and by the technique of [[crater counting]]. The radiometric ages range from about 3.16 to 4.2 Ga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors= James Papike, Grahm Ryder, and Charles Shearer |title= Lunar Samples |journal= Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry |volume= 36 |pages= 5.1–5.234 |date= 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the youngest ages determined from crater counting are about 1.2 Ga (1 Ga = 1 billion years old).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors= H. Hiesinger, J. W. Head, U. Wolf, R. Jaumanm, and G. Neukum |title= Ages and stratigraphy of mare basalts in Oceanus Procellarum, Mare Numbium, Mare Cognitum, and Mare Insularum |journal= J. Geophys.

The few basaltic eruptions that occurred on the far side are old, whereas the youngest flows are found within [[Oceanus Procellarum]] on the nearside. While many of the basalts either erupted within, or flowed into, low-lying impact basins, the largest expanse of volcanic units, Oceanus Procellarum, does not correspond to any known impact basin.

==Distribution of mare basalts==

[[Image:Clementine albedo simp750.jpg|thumb|right|500px|A global [[albedo]] map of the Moon obtained from the [[Clementine mission]].

There are many common misconceptions concerning the spatial distribution of mare basalts. 
#Since many mare basalts fill low-lying impact basins, it was once assumed that the impact event itself somehow caused the volcanic eruption. [Note: current data in fact may not preclude this, although the timing and length of mare volcanism in a number of basins cast some doubt on it. Initial mare volcanism generally seems to have begun within 100 million years of basin formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors= Harald Heisinger, Ralf Jaumann, Gerhard Neukum, James W. Head III |title= Ages of mare basalts on the lunar nearside |journal= J. Geophys. Res. |date= 2000 | volume = 105 | pages= 29,239-29.275 |doi=10.1029/2000je001244 |bibcode=2000JGR...10529239H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these authors felt that 100 million years was sufficiently long that a correlation between impact and volcanism seemed unlikely, there are problems with this argument.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} &lt;!-- Original research?: The impacts that created the basins are not necessarily as precisely dated as the basalts: the authors mix older K-Ar and Rb-Sr dates, and whole rock with individual crystal dates, and absolute dates (radiometric) with much more subjective relative dating (correlation based on spectral characteristics, crater counts) in a way that does not preclude uncertainties on the order of tens or of millions of years or more. --&gt; The authors also point out that the oldest and deepest basalts in each basin are likely buried and inaccessible, leading to a sampling bias.&lt;!--Original research?: Some of the basalts that contribute to a "long history of eruption" in a particular basin came from a separate basin.  So the question of a connection between impacts and basalt eruption seems an open one. [[Large igneous provinces]] on earth that were once thought to span tens or hundreds of millions of years are now known to have mainly erupted in less than few million years at most, with the vast bulk of activity spanning less than one or two million years in most cases.--&gt;
#It is sometimes suggested that the gravity field of the Earth might preferentially allow eruptions to occur on the [[Near side of the Moon|near side]], but not on the [[Far side of the Moon|far side]]. However, in a reference frame rotating with the Moon, the [[centrifugal acceleration]] the Moon is experiencing is exactly equal and opposite to the gravitational acceleration of the Earth. There is thus no net force directed towards the Earth. The Earth tides do act to deform the shape of the Moon, but this shape is that of an elongated ellipsoid with high points at both the sub- and anti-Earth points. As an analogy, one should remember that there are two high tides per day on Earth, and not one.
#Since mare basaltic magmas are denser than upper crustal [[anorthositic]] materials, basaltic eruptions might be favored at locations of low elevation where the crust is thin. However, the [[Far side of the Moon|far side]] [[South Pole-Aitken basin]] contains the lowest elevations of the Moon and yet is only sparingly filled by basaltic lavas. In addition, the crustal thickness beneath this basin is predicted to be much smaller than beneath [[Oceanus Procellarum]]. While the thickness of the crust might modulate the quantity of basaltic lavas that ultimately reach the surface, crustal thickness by itself cannot be the sole factor controlling the distribution of mare basalts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The role of magma buoyancy on the eruption of lunar basalts |authors= Mark Wieczorek, Maria Zuber, and Roger Phillips |journal= Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. |volume= 185 |date= 2001 |pages= 71–83 |doi= 10.1016/S0012-821X(00)00355-1 |bibcode=2001E&amp;PSL.185...71W}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#It is commonly suggested that there is some form of link between the [[synchronous rotation]] of the Moon about the Earth, and the mare basalts. However, gravitational torques that result in tidal despinning only arise from the [[moments of inertia]] of the body (these are directly relatable to the [[spherical harmonic]] degree-2 terms of the gravity field), and the mare basalts hardly contribute to this (see also [[tidal locking]]). (Hemispheric structures correspond to spherical harmonic degree 1, and do not contribute to the moments of inertia.) Furthermore, tidal despinning is predicted to have occurred quickly (in the order of tens of millions of years), whereas the majority of mare basalts erupted about one billion years later.

The reason that the mare basalts are predominantly located on the near-side hemisphere of the Moon is still being debated by the scientific community. Based on data obtained from the [[Lunar Prospector]] mission, it appears that a large proportion of the Moon's inventory of heat producing elements (in the form of [[KREEP]]) is located within the regions of [[Oceanus Procellarum]] and the [[Mare Imbrium|Imbrium basin]], a unique geochemical province now referred to as the [[Lunar terranes|Procellarum KREEP Terrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Mark A.

Shearer |display-authors= etal |title= Thermal and magmatic evolution of the Moon |journal= Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry |volume= 60 |pages= 365–518 |date= 2006 |doi= 10.2138/rmg.2006.60.4 |bibcode= 2006RvMG...60..365S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Using terrestrial classification schemes, all mare basalts are classified as [[tholeiitic]], but specific subclassifications have been invented to further describe the population of lunar basalts. Mare basalts are generally grouped into three series based on their major element chemistry: ''high-Ti basalts'', ''low-Ti basalts'', and ''very-low-Ti (VLT) basalts''. While these groups were once thought to be distinct based on the Apollo samples, global remote sensing data from the [[Clementine mission]] now shows that there is a continuum of titanium concentrations between these end members, and that the high-titanium concentrations are the least abundant. TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; abundances can reach up to 15 wt.% for mare basalts, whereas most terrestrial basalts have abundances much less than 4 wt.%. A special group of lunar basalts is the KREEP basalts, which are abnormally rich in [[potassium]] (K), [[rare earth elements]] (REE), and [[phosphorus]] (P). A major difference between terrestrial and lunar basalts is the near-total absence of water in any form in the lunar basalts. Lunar basalts do not contain hydrogen-bearing minerals like the [[amphiboles]] and [[phyllosilicates]] that are common in terrestrial basalts due to alteration or metamorphism.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The '''Lympha''' (plural ''Lymphae'') is an [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman deity]] of fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd G. Ballentine, "Some Phases of the Cult of the Nymphs," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 15 (1904), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; She is one of [[List of Roman deities#Agricultural deities|twelve agricultural deities]] listed by [[Varro]] as "leaders" (''duces'') of [[Roman agriculture|Roman farmers]], because "without water all agriculture is dry and poor."&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De re rustica'' 1.1.4–7; Peter F. Dorcey, ''The Cult of Silvanus: A Study in Roman Folk Religion'' (Brill, 1992), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lymphae are often connected to [[Fontus|Fons]], meaning "Source" or "Font," a god of [[Fountain#Ancient Roman fountains|fountains]] and [[puteal|wellheads]]. Lympha represents a "functional focus" of fresh water, according to Michael Lipka's conceptual approach to Roman deity,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally moisture.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia A. Johnston, "The Mystery Cults and Vergil's ''Georgics''," in ''Mystic Cults in Magna Graecia'' (University of Texas Press, 2009), p. 268; Matthew Dillon and Lynda Garland, ''Ancient Rome: from the early Republic to the assassination of Julius Caesar'' (Routledge, 2005), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vitruvius]] preserves some of her associations in the section of his work ''[[De architectura|On Architecture]]'' in which he describes how the design of a temple building ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]])'' should reflect the nature of the deity to be housed therein:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The character of the [[Corinthian order]] seems more appropriate to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], [[Flora (goddess)|Flora]], [[Proserpina]], and the Nymphs ''[Lymphae]'' of the Fountains; because its slenderness, elegance and richness, and its ornamental leaves surmounted by [[volute]]s, seem to bear an analogy to their dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitruvius]], ''De architectura'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#2.5 1.1.5], Bill Thayer's edition at [[LacusCurtius]] of the  translation by Joseph Gwilt, ''The Architecture of Marcus Vitruvius Pollio'' (London, 1826). The Latin text at LacusCurtius is that of [[Valentin Rose (classicist)|Valentin Rose]]'s 1899 [[Bibliotheca Teubneriana|Teubner edition]]: ''Veneri Florae Proserpinae Fonti Lumphis corinthio genere constitutae aptas videbuntur habere proprietates, quod his diis propter teneritatem graciliora et florida foliisque et volutis ornata opera facta augere videbuntur iustum decorem.'' A [[textual criticism|textual]] [[Crux (literary)|crux]] occurs at the relevant phrase: Gwilt translates ''Fontium Lumphis'' ("for the Lymphae of the Fountains"), but some editions give ''Fonti Lumphis'' ("for Fons, for the Lymphae").&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name ''Lympha'' is equivalent to, but not entirely interchangeable with ''nympha'', "[[nymph]]." One dedication for restoring the water supply was made ''nymphis lymphisque augustis'', "for the nymphs and [[Augustus (honorific)|august]] lymphae," distinguishing the two&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 5.3106; Ballentine, "Some Phases," p. 95; [[Theodor Bergk]], "Kritische bemerkungen zu den römische tragikern," ''Philologus'' 33 (1874), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; as does a passage from [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine of Hippo]], ''[[City of God (book)|De civitate Dei]]'' 4.34: the ancient Jews, he says, "did not worship Nymphs and Lymphs when the rock was smitten and poured forth water for the thirsty" (''nec quando sitientibus aquam percussa petra profudit, Nymphas Lymphasque coluerunt'', English translation by R.W. Dyson).&lt;/ref&gt; In poetic usage, ''lymphae'' as a [[common noun]], plural or less often singular, can mean a source of fresh water, or simply "water"; compare her frequent companion Fons, whose name is a word for "fountain," but who is also invoked as a deity.

When she appears in a list of [[wikt:theonym|proper names for deities]], Lympha is seen as an object of religious reverence embodying the divine aspect of water. Like several other nature deities who appear in both the singular and the plural (such as [[Faunus]]/[[faun]]i), she has both a unified and a multiple aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, ''Roman Gods'', p. 67; [[Joshua Whatmough]], ''The Foundations of Roman Italy'' (1937), p. 159. The simultaneous oneness and multiplicity of these deities is an example of [[monotheism|monotheistic]] tendencies in ancient religion: "Lower gods were executors or manifestations of the [[divine will]] rather than independent principles of reality. Whether they are called gods, demons, angels, or ''[[numen|numina]]'', these immortal beings are emanations of the One": Michele Renee Salzman, "Religious ''koine'' in Private Cult and Ritual: Shared Religious Traditions in Roman Religion in the First Half of the Fourth Century CE," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 113. The nymphs, with whom the ''lymphae'' are identified, are among the beings who inhabit forests, woodlands, and groves ''(silvas, [[nemus|nemora]], [[lucus|lucos]])'' and ponds, water sources and streams ''(lacus, fontes ac fluvios)'', according to [[Martianus Capella]] (2.167), who lists these beings as [[Pan (mythology)|pans]], [[faun]]s, ''[[Fontus|fontes]]'', [[satyr]]s, ''[[Silvanus (mythology)|silvani]]'', nymphs, [[Faunus|''fatui]]'' and ''[[Fatua|fatuae]]'' (or ''fautuae''), and the mysterious ''Fanae'', from which the ''[[fanum]]'' (sacred precinct or shrine) is supposed to get its name.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the appropriate deity to pray to for maintaining the water supply, in the way that [[Liber]] provided wine or [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] bread.&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine, "Some Phases," p. 91, citing [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], ''De civitate Dei'' 4.22, 34; 6.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and functions==
The origin of the word ''lympha'' is obscure. It may originally have been ''lumpa'' or ''limpa'', related to the adjective ''limpidus'' meaning "clear, transparent" especially applied to liquids.&lt;ref&gt;Entries on ''limpidus'' and ''lympha'', ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982, 1985 reprinting), pp. 1031 and 1055; Arthur Sidgwick, ''P.vergili Maronis Aeneidos Liber VII'' (Cambridge University Press Archive, n.d.), p. 61, note 377; Fernando Navarro Antolín, ''Lygdamus. Corpus Tibullianum III. 1–6: Lygdami elegiarum liber'' (Brill, 1996), pp. 418–419. In his ''Etymologies'' (20.3.4), [[Isidore of Seville]] says that "limpid ''(limpidus)'' wine, that is, clear, is so called from its resemblance to water, as if it were ''lymphidum'', because ''lympha'' is water"; translation by Stephen A. Barney ''et al.'', ''The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; An intermediate form ''lumpha'' is also found.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 1.1238, as cited by Bergk, "Kritische bemerkungen zu den römische tragikern," p. 269. Bergk demonstrated that ''lympha'' was in origin Italic, and not a borrowed Greek term, despite the spelling.&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling seems to have been influenced by the Greek word νύμφα ''nympha'', as the [[upsilon]] (Υ,υ) and [[phi]] (Φ,φ) are normally transcribed into [[Latin language|Latin]] as ''u'' or ''y'' and ''ph'' or ''f''.&lt;ref&gt;Bergk, "Kritische bemerkungen zu den römische tragikern," pp. 264–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

That ''Lympha'' is an [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] concept&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Champeaux, "Sorts et divination inspirée. Pour une préhistoire des oracles italiques," ''[[Mélanges de l'École française de Rome]]'' 102.2 (1990), p. 827.&lt;/ref&gt; is indicated by the [[Oscan language|Oscan]] [[cognate]] ''diumpā-'' (recorded in the [[dative case|dative]] plural, ''diumpaís'', "for the lymphae"), with a characteristic alternation of ''d'' for ''l''.&lt;ref&gt;Whatmough, ''Foundations of Roman Italy'', p. 383; [[Robert Seymour Conway|R.S. Conway]], ''The Italic Dialects'' (Cambridge University Press, 1897), p. 676; Johnston, ''Mystic Cults in Magna Graecia'', p. 268;  Bergk, "Kritische bemerkungen," p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; These goddesses appear on the ''Tabula Agnonensis'' as one of 17 [[Samnium|Samnite]] deities, who include the equivalents of Flora, Proserpina, and possibly Venus (all categorized with the Lymphae by Vitruvius), as well as several of the gods on Varro's [[List of Roman deities#Varro, De re rustica|list of the 12 agricultural deities]]. On the Oscan tablet, they appear in a group of deities who provide moisture for crops.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Mystic Cults in Magna Graecia'', pp. 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#disciplina Etrusca|Etruscan-based]] cosmological schema of [[Martianus Capella]], the Lymphae are placed in the second of 16 celestial regions, with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Quirinus]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] (these three constituting the [[Archaic Triad]]), the [[Lares|Military Lar]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], Fons, and the obscure Italo-Etruscan [[Novensiles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martianus Capella]], ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'' 1.46 [https://books.google.com/books?id=nZ-Z9eI6dXwC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Lympha+OR+Lymphae&amp;lr=&amp;cd=11#v=onepage&amp;q=Lympha%20OR%20Lymphae&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; A 1st-century A.D. dedication was made to the Lymphae jointly with [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 9.4644 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 3857.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italic ''lymphae'' were connected with healing cults. [[Juturna]], who is usually called a "nymph," is identified by Varro as ''Lympha'': "Juturna is the ''Lympha'' who aids: therefore many ailing people on account of her name customarily seek out this water", with a play on the name ''Iu-turna'' and the verb ''iuvare'', "to help, aid."&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 5.71:  (''Lympha Iuturna quae iuvaret: itaque multi aegroti propter id nomen hanc aquam petere solent''). See also [[Frontinus]], ''On Aqueducts'' 1.4, where Juturna is in company with the [[Camenae]] and [[Apollo]].  C. Bennett Pascal, ''The Cults of Cisalpine Gaul'' (Latomus, 1964), p. 93, reads an inscription as linking the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic god]] [[Belenus]] (usually identified with Apollo) and the ''Lymphae'', but [[Hermann Dessau|Dessau]] reads ''Nymphae'' (''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 4867). [[Servius]], note to ''Aeneid'' 12.139, has Juturna as a ''fons'', and [[Propertius]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=xNTTGDpy5tQC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22lympha+salubris%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-aj7TOyME8S0nAe6wrjICg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lympha%20salubris%22&amp;f=false 4.21.26], as the ''lympha salubris'' who restored a horse of [[Castor and Pollux|Pollux]] ([[textual criticism|some editions emend]] to ''nympha''; see note to the line at ''Sexti Aurelii Propertii Elegiarum Libri Quattuor'', edited by N. Lemaire (1840), p. 448 [https://books.google.com/books?id=NPcZAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA448&amp;dq=%22lympha+salubris%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-aj7TOyME8S0nAe6wrjICg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lympha%20salubris%22&amp;f=false online]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lacus Juturnae|Juturna's water shrine was a spring-fed ''lacus'']] in the [[Roman Forum|forum]] which attracted cure-seekers, and [[Propertius]] connected its potency to [[Lake Albano]] and [[Lake Nemi]], where the famous sanctuary of [[Diana Nemorensis]] was located.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), pp. 74, 105, 152, 228, 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt; Juturna's cult, which [[Servius]] identifies as a ''fons'', was maintained to ensure the water supply, and she was the mother of the deity Fons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 12.139: "Juturna is a fountain ''(fons)'' in Italy. … It was customary to offer sacrifices to this fountain in respect to a scarcity of water," as cited and discussed by Ballentine, "Some Phases," pp. 91–93. The temple was vowed by [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus|G. Lutatius Catulus]] as the result of a [[Roman navy|naval battle]] during the [[First Punic War]]. [[Arnobius]], ''Adversus Nationes'' 3.29, identifies her as the mother of Fons.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cisalpine Gaul]], an inscription links the Lymphae to the Vires, "(Physical) Powers, Vigor", personified as a set of masculine divinities,&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' 5.5648; Joseph Clyde Murley, ''The Cults of Cisalpine Gaul as Seen in the Inscriptions'' (Banta, 1922), pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; a connection that in his monumental work ''Zeus'' [[Arthur Bernard Cook]] located in the flowing or liquid aspect of the Lymphae as it relates to the production of [[semen|seminal fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Bernard Cook]], ''Zeus'' (Cambridge University Press Archive), p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; As a complement to the Vires, the Lymphae and the nymphs with whom they became so closely identified embody the urge to procreate, and thus these kinds of water deities are also associated with marriage and childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Onians, ''The Origins of European Thought about the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate'' (Cambridge University Press, 1951), p. 220; Ballentine, "Some Phases of the Cult of the Nymphs," p. 97ff; on marriage (mainly in regard to nymphs, but see note 216), Salvatore Settis, "'Esedra' e 'ninfeo' nella terminologia architettonica del mondo romano," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' (1973), pp. 685–688.&lt;/ref&gt; When Propertius alludes to the story of how [[Tiresias]] spied the virgin goddess [[Pallas Athena]] bathing, he plays on the sexual properties of ''lympha'' in advising against [[theophany|theophanies]] obtained against the will of the gods: "May the gods grant you other fountains ''(fontes)'': this liquid ''(lympha)'' flows for girls only, this pathless trickle of a secret threshold."&lt;ref&gt;[[Propertius]], ''Elegies'' 4.9.59–60, as cited and discussed by Tara S. Welch, "Masculinity and Monuments in Propertius 4.9," ''American Journal of Philology'' 125 (2004), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poets]] frequently play with the ambiguous dual meaning of ''lympha'' as both "water source" and "nymph". In the poetry of [[Horace]],&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine, "Some Phases," p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; ''lymphae'' work,&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''Carmen'' 2.3.11–12 ''(laborat)''.&lt;/ref&gt; dance,&lt;ref&gt;''Carmen'' 3.13.13–16 ''(desiliunt)'' and Epode 16.47–48 ''(desilit)''.&lt;/ref&gt; and make noise;&lt;ref&gt;Epode 2.27 ''(obstrepunt)''.&lt;/ref&gt; they are talkative,&lt;ref&gt;''Carmen'' 3.13.13–16''(loquaces)''.&lt;/ref&gt; and when they're angry they cause drought until their rites are observed.&lt;ref&gt;''Sermo'' 1.5.96–103 ''(iratis)''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[textual criticism|textual editors]] have responded to this [[personification]] by emending [[manuscript]] readings of ''lymphae'' to ''nymphae''. When the first letter of a form of ''-ympha'' is obliterated or indistinct in an inscription, the word is usually taken as ''nympha'' instead of the less common ''lympha''.&lt;ref&gt;Bergk, "Kritische bemerkungen zu den römische tragikern," pp. 268–269; Wilhelm Adolf Boguslaw Hertzberg, note to Propertius 3.16, ''Sex. Aurelii Propertii Elegiarum Libri Quattuor'' (1845), p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine madness==
[[File:Hylas nymphs Massimo Inv423108.jpg|thumb|300px|Roman mosaic depicting the abduction of [[Hylas]] by the nymphs]]
In the [[Religion in ancient Greece|religions of ancient Greece]], Rome, and the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] territories,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ausonius]], ''Ordo urbium nobilium'' 20.29–34, mentioning [[Divona]]; entry on "Spring deities" in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'', edited by John Koch (ABC-Clio, 2006), pp. 1623–1624.&lt;/ref&gt; water goddesses are commonly sources of inspiration or divine revelation, which may have the appearance of madness or frenzy. In [[ancient Greek language|Greek]], "nympholepsy" ("seizure by the nymphs") was primarily "a heightening of awareness and elevated verbal skills" resulting from the influence of the nymphs on an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lynn Larson, ''Greek Nymphs: Myth, Cult, Lore'' (Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The term also meant a physical snatching or abduction of a person by the nymphs, as in the myth of [[Hylas]], and by extension became a euphemism or metaphor for death, as evidenced by both Greek and Roman epitaphs.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, ''Greek Nymphs'', pp. 13–14, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; A person who was a religious devotee of the nymphs might also be called a "nympholept."&lt;ref&gt;Larson, ''Greek Nymphs'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Latin verb]] ''lympho, lymphare'' meant "to drive crazy" or "to be in a state of frenzy," with the adjectives ''lymphaticus'' and ''lymphatus'' meaning "frenzied, deranged" and the [[abstract noun]] ''lymphatio'' referring to the state itself. [[Vergil]] uses the adjective ''lymphata'' only once,&lt;ref&gt;Gertrude Hirst, "An Attempt to Date the Composition of ''Aeneid'' VII," ''Classical Quarterly'' 10 (1916), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' to describe the madness of [[Amata]], wife of [[Latinus]], goaded by the [[Furies|Fury]] [[Allecto]] and raving contrary to ''[[mos maiorum|mos]]'', socially sanctioned behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vergil]], ''Aeneid'' 7.377, as noted by Sidgwick, p. 61, and R.D. Williams, ''The Aeneid of Vergil: Books 7–12'' (St. Martins Press, 1973, 1977), pp. 195–196, who observes that it is "a very strong word." See also Debra Hershkowitz, ''The Madness of Epic: Reading Insanity from Homer to Statius'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Greeks, the Cult of the Nymphs was a part of [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] or [[Dionysian mysteries|Dionysiac religion]]. The adjective ''lymphatus'' was "strongly evocative of Bacchic frenzy,"&lt;ref&gt;As at [[Pacuvius]]. ''Trag.'' 422f.; [[Catullus]] 64.254, the [[Ariadne]] [[epyllion]]; and [[Lucan]], ''Bellum Civile'' 1.496, as noted by Paul Roche, ''Lucan: De Bello Civili, Book 1'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman playwright]] [[Pacuvius]] (220–130 BC) explicitly connects it to ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacra|sacra]] Bacchi'', "rites of [[Bacchus]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pacuvius as quoted by Varro, ''De lingua latina'' 7.5. See also Johnston, ''Mystic Cults in Magna Graecia'', p. 268. In 186 BC, during the lifetime of Pacuvius, the [[Roman senate]] placed severe legal [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|restrictions on the Bacchanalia]], the Dionysian rites celebrated in Italy.&lt;/ref&gt; R.B. Onians explained the "fluidity" of the ecstatic gods in the context of ancient theories about the relation of body and mind, with dryness a quality of rationality and liquid productive of emotion. Water as a [[wikt:locus|locus]] of divine, even frenzied inspiration links the Lymphae to the Latin [[Camenae]], who became identified with the [[Muses]].&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Onians, ''The Origins of European Thought about the Body, the Mind, the Soul, the World, Time and Fate'' (Cambridge University Press, 1951), pp. 34–35, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his entry on ''Lymphae'', the [[lexicographer]] [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] notes that the Greek word ''nympha'' had influenced the Latin name, and elaborates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Popular belief has it that whoever see a certain vision in a fountain, that is, an apparition of a nymph, will go quite mad. These people the Greeks call ''numpholêptoi'' ["Nymph-possessed"] and the Romans, ''lymphatici''.&lt;ref&gt;Translation from Larson, ''Greek Nymphs'', pp. 62–63. Festus states that the ''Lymphae'' are "called that after the nymphs," then explains: ''Vulgo autem memoriae proditum est, quicumque speciem quandam e fonte, id est effigiem nymphae, viderint, furendi non feciesse finem; quos Graeci νυμφολήπτους vocant. Latini lymphaticos appellant'' (p. 107, Teubner 1997 edition of Lindsay).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Because the states of madness, possession, and illness were not always strictly distinguished in antiquity, "nympholepsy" became a morbid or undesirable condition.&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;Larson, ''Greek Nymphs'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] compares Greek ''[[:wikt:hydrophobia|hydrophobia]]'', which literally means "fear of water," and says that "''lymphaticus'' is the word for one who contracts a disease from water, making him run about hither and thither, or from the disease gotten from a flow of water." In poetic usage, he adds, the ''lymphatici'' are madmen.&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''Etymologies'' 4.6.12 and 10.L.161, as translated by Barney ''et al.'', pp. 110, 223. See also [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], entry on ''Lymphae'', p. 107 in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Ugb6woUJLoC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=lympha+OR+Lymphae&amp;lr=&amp;cd=23#v=onepage&amp;q=lympha%20OR%20Lymphae&amp;f=false edition of Lindsay.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Christianization]] of the Empire in [[late antiquity]], the positive effects of possession by a nymph were erased, and nymphs were [[syncretism|syncretized]] with [[fallen angel]]s and dangerous figures such as the [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]] and [[Gello]].&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; [[Tertullian]] amplifies from a [[Early Christianity|Christian]] perspective anxieties that [[unclean spirit]]s might lurk in various water sources, noting that men whom waters ''(aquae)'' have killed or driven to madness or a terrified state are called "nymph-caught ''(nympholeptos)'' or lymphatic or hydrophobic."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tertullian]], "On Baptism" 2.5. translated by S. Thelwall: "Are there not other cases, too, in which, without any sacrament, [[unclean spirit]]s brood on waters, in spurious imitation of that brooding of the Divine Spirit in the very beginning? Witness all shady founts ''(fontes)'', and all unfrequented brooks, and the ponds in the baths and the conduits in private houses, the cisterns and wells which are said to have the property of 'spiriting away' through the power, that is, of a hurtful spirit. Men whom waters have drowned or affected with madness or with fear, they call nymph-caught ''(nympholeptos)'', or 'lymphatic,' or 'hydrophobic' ''(an non et alias sine ullo sacramento immundi spiritus aquis incubant adfectantes illam in primordio divini spiritus gestationem? sciunt opaci quique fontes et avii quique rivi, et in balneis piscinae et euripi in domibus vel cisternae, et putei qui [[raptio|rapere]] dicuntur, scilicet per vim spiritus nocentis. nam et esetos et lymphaticos et hydrophobas vocant quos aquae necaverunt aut amentia vel formidine exercuerunt)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mass transfer''' is the net movement of mass from one location, usually meaning  stream, phase, fraction or component, to another. Mass transfer occurs in many processes, such as [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]], [[evaporation]], [[drying]], [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], [[Membrane technology|membrane filtration]], and [[distillation]]. Mass transfer is used by different scientific disciplines for different processes and mechanisms. The phrase is commonly used in [[engineering]] for physical processes that involve [[molecular diffusion|diffusive]] and [[convection|convective]] transport of [[chemical species]] within [[system|physical systems]].

Some common examples of mass transfer processes are the [[evaporation]] of [[water]] from a pond to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the purification of blood in the [[kidney]]s and [[liver]], and the distillation of alcohol. In industrial processes, mass transfer operations include separation of chemical components in distillation columns, absorbers such as scrubbers or stripping, adsorbers such as activated carbon beds, and [[liquid-liquid extraction]]. Mass transfer is often coupled to additional [[transport phenomena|transport processes]], for instance in industrial [[cooling tower]]s. These towers couple heat transfer to mass transfer by allowing hot water to flow in contact with air. The water is cooled by expelling some of its content in the form of water vapour.

==Astrophysics==

In [[astrophysics]], mass transfer is the process by which [[matter]] [[gravitation]]ally bound to a body, usually a [[star]], fills its [[Roche lobe]] and becomes gravitationally bound to a second body, usually a compact object ([[white dwarf]], [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]]), and is eventually accreted onto it. It is a common phenomenon in [[binary star|binary systems]], and may play an important role in some types of [[supernova]]e and [[pulsar]]s.

==Chemical engineering==

Mass transfer finds extensive application in [[chemical engineering]] problems. It is used in reaction engineering, separations engineering, heat transfer engineering, and many other sub-disciplines of chemical engineering like electrochemical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Electrochimica Acta 100 (2013) 78-84. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2013.03.134&lt;/ref&gt;

The driving force for mass transfer is usually a difference in [[chemical potential]], when it can be defined, though other [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic gradients]] may couple to the flow of mass and drive it as well. A chemical species moves from areas of high chemical potential to areas of low chemical potential. Thus, the maximum theoretical extent of a given mass transfer is typically determined by the point at which the chemical potential is uniform. For single phase-systems, this usually translates to uniform concentration throughout the phase, while for multiphase systems chemical species will often prefer one phase over the others and reach a uniform chemical potential only when most of the chemical species has been absorbed into the preferred phase, as in [[liquid-liquid extraction]].

While thermodynamic equilibrium determines the theoretical extent of a given mass transfer operation, the actual rate of mass transfer will depend on additional factors including the flow patterns within the system and the [[mass diffusivity|diffusivities]] of the species in each phase. This rate can be quantified through the calculation and application of [[mass transfer coefficient]]s for an overall process. These mass transfer coefficients are typically published in terms of [[dimensionless quantities|dimensionless numbers]], often including [[Péclet number]]s, [[Reynolds number]]s, [[Sherwood number]]s and [[Schmidt number]]s, among others.&lt;ref name="basictext"&gt;{{cite book

==Analogies between heat, mass, and momentum transfer==
{{main|Transport phenomena (engineering &amp; physics)|l1=Transport phenomena}}
There are notable similarities in the commonly used approximate differential equations for momentum, heat, and mass transfer.&lt;ref name="basictext"/&gt; The molecular transfer equations of [[Newtonian fluid|Newton's law]] for fluid momentum at low [[Reynolds number]] ([[Stokes flow]]), [[Heat conduction|Fourier's law]] for heat, and [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's law]] for mass are very similar, since they are all [[linear approximation]]s to transport of conserved quantities in a flow field. 
At higher Reynolds number, the analogy between mass and heat transfer and momentum transfer becomes less useful due to the [[nonlinearity]] of the [[Navier-Stokes equation]] (or more fundamentally, the [[Momentum#Relating to force – general equations of motion|general momentum conservation equation]]), but the analogy between heat and mass transfer remains good. A great deal of effort has been devoted to developing analogies among these three transport processes so as to allow prediction of one from any of the others.

A '''micellar cubic''' phase is a [[lyotropic liquid crystal]] phase formed when the concentration of [[micelles]] dispersed in a solvent (usually water) is sufficiently high that they are forced to pack into a structure having long-ranged positional (translational) order. For example, spherical micelles a subic packing of a body-centred cubic lattice. [[Normal topology]] micellar cubic phases, denoted by the symbol I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, are the first lyotropic liquid crystalline phases that are formed by [[type I amphiphiles]]. The amphiphiles' hydrocarbon tails are contained on the inside of the micelle and hence the polar-apolar interface of the aggregates has a positive [[mean curvature]], by definition (it curves away from the polar phase). [[Inverse topology]] micellar cubic phases (such as the Fd3m phase) are observed for some [[type II amphiphiles]] at very high amphiphile concentrations. These aggregates, in which water is the minority phase, have a polar-apolar interface with a negative [[mean curvature]]. The structures of the normal topology micellar cubic phases that are formed by some types of amphiphiles (e.g. the oligoethyleneoxide monoalkyl ether series of [[non-ionic surfactants]] are the subject of debate. Micellar cubic phases are isotropic phases, but are distinguished from [[micellar solutions]] by their very high viscosity. When thin film samples of micellar cubic phases are viewed under a polarising microscope they appear dark and featureless. Small air bubbles trapped in these preparations tend to appear highly distorted and occasionally have faceted surfaces.

[[File:E coli at 10000x, original.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|A [[Colony (biology)#Microbial colonies|cluster]] of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' [[bacteria]] magnified 10,000 times]]

A '''microorganism''', or '''microbe''',{{efn|The word ''microorganism'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|aɪ|k|r|oʊ-|ˈ|ɔːr|g|ə|n|ᵻ|z|əm}}) uses [[classical compound|combining forms]] of ''[[wikt:micro-#Prefix|micro-]]'' (from the {{lang-el|μικρός}}, ''mikros'', "small") and ''[[organism]]'' from the {{lang-el|ὀργανισμός}}, ''organismós'', "organism"). It is usually styled solid but is sometimes [[hyphen]]ated (''micro-organism''), especially in older texts. The informal synonym ''microbe'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|aɪ|k|r|oʊ|b}}) comes from  μικρός, mikrós, "small" and βίος, bíos, "[[life]]".}} is a [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] [[organism]], which may exist in its [[unicellular organism|single-celled]] form or in a [[Colony (biology)#Microbial colonies|colony of cells]].

The possible existence of unseen microbial life was suspected from ancient times, such as in [[Jain scriptures]] from 6th century BC India and the 1st century BC book ''On Agriculture'' by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]. [[Microbiology]], the scientific study of microorganisms, began with their observation under the [[microscope]] in the 1670s by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]. In the 1850s, [[Louis Pasteur]] found that microorganisms caused [[food spoilage]], debunking the theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. In the 1880s [[Robert Koch]] discovered that microorganisms caused the diseases [[tuberculosis]], [[cholera]] and [[anthrax]].

Microorganisms include all [[unicellular organism]]s and so are extremely diverse. Of the [[three-domain system|three domains of life]] identified by [[Carl Woese]], all of the [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]] are microorganisms. These were previously grouped together in the [[Two-empire system|two domain system]] as [[Prokaryotes]], the other being the eukaryotes. The third domain [[Eukaryota]] includes all [[multicellular organism]]s and many unicellular [[protist]]s and [[protozoa]]ns. Some protists are related to [[animals]] and some to [[green plants]]. Many of the multicellular organisms are microscopic, namely [[micro-animal]]s, some [[fungus|fungi]] and some [[algae]], but these are not discussed here.

They live in almost every [[habitat]] from the [[Geographic pole|poles]] to the [[equator]], [[desert]]s, [[geyser]]s, [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] and the [[deep sea]]. Some are [[extremophiles|adapted to extremes]] such as [[hyperthermophiles|very hot]] or [[psychrophile|very cold conditions]], others to [[piezophile|high pressure]] and a few such as ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' to [[radioresistance|high radiation]] environments. Microorganisms also make up the [[microbiota]] found in and on all multicellular organisms. A December 2017 report stated that 3.45-billion-year-old [[Australia]]n rocks once contained microorganisms, the earliest direct evidence of life on Earth.&lt;ref name="WU-20171218"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyrell |first=Kelly April |title=Oldest fossils ever found show life on Earth began before 3.5 billion years ago |url=https://news.wisc.edu/oldest-fossils-ever-found-show-life-on-earth-began-before-3-5-billion-years-ago/ |date=18 December 2017 |work=[[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] |accessdate=18 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PNAS-2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schopf |first1=J.

[[File:Spallanzani.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] showed that boiling a broth stopped it from decaying.]]

===Ancient precursors===
The possible existence of microorganisms was discussed for many centuries before their discovery in the 17th century. By the fifth century BC, the [[Jain]]s of present-day India postulated the existence of tiny organisms called [[nigoda]]s.&lt;ref name="JDL_2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jeffery D Long |title=Jainism: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3gAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100 |year=2013 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-0-85771-392-6 |page=100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These nigodas are said to be born in clusters; they live everywhere, including the bodies of plants, animals, and people; and their life lasts only for fraction of a second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Upinder Singh |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq2iCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA315 |year=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=978-81-317-1677-9 |page=315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain leader Mahavira, the humans destroy these nigodas on a massive scale, when they eat, breathe, sit and move.&lt;ref name="JDL_2013"/&gt; Many modern Jains assert that Mahavira's teachings presage the existence of microorganisms as discovered by modern science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul Dundas |title=The Jains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1-134-50165-X |pages=106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known idea to indicate the possibility of diseases spreading by yet unseen organisms was that of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in a 1st-century BC book titled ''On Agriculture'' in which he called the unseen creatures [[animalcule]]s, and warns against locating a homestead near a swamp:&lt;ref name=Varro&gt;''Varro On Agriculture'' 1, xii Loeb&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|… and because there are bred certain minute creatures that cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and they cause serious diseases.&lt;ref name=Varro/&gt;}}

In ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1020), [[Avicenna]] suggested that [[tuberculosis]] and other diseases might be contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tschanz |first=David W. |title=Arab Roots of European Medicine |journal=Heart Views |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages= |url=http://www.hmc.org.qa/hmc/heartviews/h-v-v4%20n2/9.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503050312/http://www.hmc.org.qa/hmc/heartviews/H-V-v4%20N2/9.htm |archivedate=3 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advice to the Young Physician: On the Art of Medicine|url={{google books |plainurl=y|id=DoMVs4HuDAoC|page=33}} |last=Colgan|first=Richard |page=33 |publisher=Springer |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4419-1033-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
[[Akshamsaddin]] (Turkish scientist) mentioned the [[microbe]] in his work ''Maddat ul-Hayat'' (The Material of Life) about two centuries prior to [[Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek]]'s discovery through experimentation:
{{cquote|It is incorrect to assume that diseases appear one by one in humans. Disease infects by spreading from one person to another. This infection occurs through seeds that are so small they cannot be seen but are alive.&lt;ref&gt;Taşköprülüzâde: ''Shaqaiq-e Numaniya'', v. 1, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osman Şevki Uludağ: ''Beş Buçuk Asırlık Türk Tabâbet Tarihi'' (Five and a Half Centuries of Turkish Medical History). Istanbul, 1969, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[1546 in science#Medicine|1546]], [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] proposed that [[epidemic]] [[diseases]] were caused by transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or even without contact over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nutton |first=Vivian |title=The Reception of Fracastoro's Theory of Contagion: The Seed That Fell among Thorns? |journal=[[Osiris (journal)|Osiris]]|year=1990 |volume=2nd Series, Vol. 6, Renaissance Medical Learning: Evolution of a Tradition |pages=196–234 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |jstor=301787 |doi=10.1086/368701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek]] is considered to be the [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|father of microbiology]]. He was the first in [[1673 in science|1673]] to discover, observe, describe, study and conduct scientific experiments with microoorganisms, using simple single-lensed [[microscope]]s of his own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Leeuwenhoek, A. | title=Part of a Letter from Mr Antony van Leeuwenhoek, concerning the Worms in Sheeps Livers, Gnats, and Animalcula in the Excrements of Frogs | journal=Philosophical Transactions | volume=22 | pages=509–18 | year=1753 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1700.0013 | issue=260–276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Leeuwenhoek, A. |authorlink=Antony van Leeuwenhoek | title=Part of a Letter from Mr Antony van Leeuwenhoek, F.

===19th century===
[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Louis Pasteur]] showed that Spallanzani's findings held even if air could enter through a filter that kept particles out.]]

[[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) exposed boiled broths to the air, in vessels that contained a filter to prevent particles from passing through to the [[growth medium]], and also in vessels without a filter, but with air allowed in via a curved tube so dust particles would settle and not come in contact with the broth. By boiling the broth beforehand, Pasteur ensured that no microorganisms survived within the broths at the beginning of his experiment. Nothing grew in the broths in the course of Pasteur's experiment. This meant that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as [[spore]]s on dust, rather than spontaneously generated within the broth. Thus, Pasteur dealt the death blow to the theory of [[spontaneous generation]] and supported the [[germ theory of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bordenave, G. |title=Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) |journal=Microbes Infect. |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=553–60 |year=2003 |pmid=12758285 |doi=10.1016/S1286-4579(03)00075-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Koch.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Koch]] showed that microorganisms caused [[disease]].]]

In 1876, [[Robert Koch]] (1843–1910) established that microorganisms can cause disease. He found that the blood of cattle which were infected with [[anthrax]] always had large numbers of ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking a small sample of blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as [[Koch's postulates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1905] Nobelprize.org Accessed 22 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=O'Brien, S.; Goedert, J. | title=HIV causes AIDS: Koch's postulates fulfilled | journal=Curr Opin Immunol | volume=8 | issue=5 | pages=613–18 | year=1996 | pmid=8902385 | doi=10.1016/S0952-7915(96)80075-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of microorganisms such as ''[[Euglena]]'' that did not fit into either the [[animal]] or [[plant]] kingdoms, since they were [[photosynthetic]] like plants, but [[motility|motile]] like animals, led to the naming of a third kingdom in the 1860s. In 1860 [[John Hogg (biologist)|John Hogg]] called this the Protoctista, and in 1866 [[Ernst Haeckel]] named it the [[Protista]].&lt;ref name=Scamardella1999&gt;{{cite journal | author=Scamardella, J.

The work of Pasteur and Koch did not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbial world because of their exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical relevance.

==Classification and structure==

Microorganisms can be found almost anywhere on [[Earth]]. [[Bacteria]] and [[archaea]] are almost always microscopic, while a number of [[eukaryote]]s are also microscopic, including most [[Protista|protists]], some [[fungus|fungi]], as well as some [[micro-animal]]s and plants. [[Virus]]es are generally regarded as [[Non-cellular life|not living]] and therefore not considered as microorganisms, although a subfield of [[microbiology]] is [[virology]], the study of viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/npg.els.0000459/abstract|title=eLS|last=Lim|first=Daniel V. |date=2001 |publisher=John Wiley |isbn=9780470015902 |doi=10.1038/npg.els.0000459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.highveld.com/microbiology/what-is-microbiology.html|title=What is Microbiology? |website=www.highveld.com |access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cann |first=Alan |title=Principles of Molecular Virology |year=2011 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0123849397 |edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microorganisms tend to have a relatively fast rate of evolution.

A possible transitional form of microorganism between a prokaryote and a eukaryote was discovered in 2012 by Japanese scientists. ''[[Parakaryon myojinensis]]'' is a unique microorganism larger than a typical prokaryote, but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a eukaryote, and the presence of endosymbionts. This is seen to be the first plausible evolutionary form of microorganism, showing a stage of development from the prokaryote to the eukaryote.&lt;ref name="Parakaryon"&gt;{{cite web |title=Deep sea microorganisms and the origin of the eukaryotic cell |url=http://protistology.jp/journal/jjp47/JJP47YAMAGUCHI.pdf |accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yamaguchi et al.|first1=Masashi |title=Prokaryote or eukaryote?

===Archaea===
{{main|Archaea}}
{{further|Prokaryote}}

Archaea are [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] unicellular organisms, and form the first domain of life, in [[Carl Woese]]'s [[three-domain system]]. A prokaryote is defined as having no [[cell nucleus]] or other [[lipid bilayer|membrane bound]]-[[organelle]]. Archaea share this defining feature with the bacteria with which they were once grouped. In 1990 the microbiologist Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living things into bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Woese, C. |author1link=Carl Woese | author2=Kandler, O. | author3=Wheelis, M. | title=Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | doi= 10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume=87 | issue=12 | pages=4576–9 | year=1990 | pmid=2112744 | pmc=54159 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby split the prokaryote domain.

Archaea differ from bacteria in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial [[cell membrane]]s are made from [[phospholipid|phosphoglycerides]] with [[ester]] bonds, archaean membranes are made of [[ether lipid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=De Rosa, M. |author2=Gambacorta, A. | author3=Gliozzi, A. |title=Structure, biosynthesis, and physicochemical properties of archaebacterial lipids |journal=Microbiol.

The combined domains of archaea and bacteria make up the most diverse and abundant group of [[organism]]s on Earth and inhabit practically all environments where the temperature is below +140&amp;nbsp;°C. They are found in [[water]], [[soil]], [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], as the [[microbiota|microbiome]] of an organism, [[hot spring]]s and even deep beneath the Earth's crust in [[Rock (geology)|rocks]].&lt;ref name=Gold&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gold, T. |title=The deep, hot biosphere |journal=Proc.

The biodiversity of the prokaryotes is unknown, but may be very large. A May 2016 estimate, based on laws of scaling from known numbers of species against the size of organism, gives an estimate of perhaps 1 trillion species on the planet, of which most would be microorganisms. Currently, only one-thousandth of one percent of that total have been described.&lt;ref name="NSF-2016002"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Researchers find that Earth may be home to 1 trillion species |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=138446 |date=2 May 2016 |work=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=6 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[genome]] is usually a [[circular bacterial chromosome]] – a single loop of [[DNA]], although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called [[plasmid]]s. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through [[bacterial conjugation]]. Bacteria have an enclosing [[Bacterial cell structure#Cell wall|cell wall]], which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by [[binary fission]] or sometimes by [[budding]], but do not undergo [[Meiosis|meiotic]] [[sexual reproduction]].

===Eukaryotes===
{{Main|Eukaryote}}

Most living things that are visible to the naked eye in their adult form are [[eukaryote]]s, including [[human]]s. However, a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms. Unlike [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], eukaryotes contain [[organelle]]s such as the [[cell nucleus]], the [[Golgi apparatus]] and [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in their [[cell (biology)|cells]]. The nucleus is an organelle that houses the [[DNA]] that makes up a cell's genome. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) itself is arranged in complex [[chromosome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/alllife/eukaryotamm.html Eukaryota: More on Morphology.] (Retrieved 10 October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
Mitochondria are organelles vital in [[metabolism]] as they are the site of the [[citric acid cycle]] and [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. They evolved from [[symbiotic]] bacteria and retain a remnant genome.&lt;ref name=Dyall&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Dyall, S.; Brown, M.; Johnson, P. | title=Ancient invasions: from endosymbionts to organelles | journal=Science | volume=304 | issue=5668 | pages=253–7 | year=2004|pmid=15073369 | doi=10.1126/science.1094884|bibcode=2004Sci...304..253D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like bacteria, [[plant cell]]s have [[cell wall]]s, and contain organelles such as [[chloroplast]]s in addition to the organelles in other eukaryotes. Chloroplasts produce energy from [[light]] by [[photosynthesis]], and were also originally symbiotic [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name=Dyall/&gt;

Unicellular eukaryotes consist of a single [[Cell (biology)|cell]] throughout their life cycle. This qualification is significant since most [[multicellular organism|multicellular]] eukaryotes consist of a single cell called a [[zygote]] only at the beginning of their life cycles. Microbial eukaryotes can be either [[haploid]] or [[diploid]], and some organisms have multiple [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[coenocyte]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Unicellular eukaryotes usually reproduce asexually by [[mitosis]] under favorable conditions. However, under stressful conditions such as nutrient limitations and other conditions associated with DNA damage, they tend to reproduce sexually by [[meiosis]] and [[Fertilization|syngamy]].&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bernstein |first1=H. |last2=Bernstein |first2=C. |last3=Michod |first3=R.E. |year=2012 |url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=31918 |title=DNA repair as the primary adaptive function of sex in bacteria and eukaryotes.  |chapter=Chapter 1 |pages=1–49 |work= DNA Repair: New Research |editor-first1=Sakura |editor-last1=Kimura |editor-first2=Sora |editor-last2=Shimizu |publisher=Nova Sci.

====Fungi====
{{Main|Fungus}}

The [[fungus|fungi]] have several unicellular species, such as baker's yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') and fission yeast (''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]''). Some fungi, such as the pathogenic yeast ''[[Candida albicans]]'', can undergo [[phenotypic switching]] and grow as single cells in some environments, and [[Hypha|filamentous hyphae]] in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Kumamoto, C.A.; Vinces, M.D. |title=Contributions of hyphae and hypha-co-regulated genes to Candida albicans virulence |journal=Cell.

====Plants====
{{Main|Plant}}

The [[green algae]] are a large group of photosynthetic eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms. Although some green algae are classified as [[protist]]s, others such as [[charophyta]] are classified with [[embryophyte]] plants, which are the most familiar group of land plants. Algae can grow as single cells, or in long chains of cells. The green algae include unicellular and colonial [[flagellate]]s, usually but not always with two [[flagellum|flagella]] per cell, as well as various colonial, [[Chlorococcales|coccoid]], and filamentous forms. In the [[Charales]], which are the algae most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of green algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Thomas, David C. |title=Seaweeds |publisher=Natural History Museum |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=0-565-09175-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
{{main |Microbial ecology}}

Microorganisms are found in almost every [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] present in nature, including hostile environments such as the [[Geographic poles|North and South poles]], [[desert]]s, [[geyser]]s, and [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]. They also include all the [[marine microorganism]]s of the [[World ocean|oceans]] and [[deep sea]]. Some types of microorganisms have adapted to [[extreme environment]]s and sustained colonies; these organisms are known as [[extremophiles]]. Extremophiles have been isolated from rocks as much as 7 kilometres below the Earth's surface,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Szewzyk, U; Szewzyk, R; Stenström, T. | title=Thermophilic, anaerobic bacteria isolated from a deep borehole in granite in Sweden | doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.5.1810 | journal=PNAS | volume=91 | issue=5 | pages=1810–3 | year=1994 | pmid=11607462 | pmc=43253 | bibcode=1994PNAS...91.1810S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that the amount of organisms living below the Earth's surface is comparable with the amount of life on or above the surface.&lt;ref name=Gold/&gt; Extremophiles have been known to survive for a prolonged time in a [[vacuum]], and can be highly resistant to [[ultraviolet radiation|radiation]], which may even allow them to survive in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Horneck, G. | title=Survival of microorganisms in space: a review | journal=Adv Space Res | volume=1 | issue=14 | pages=39–48 | year=1981|pmid=11541716 | doi=10.1016/0273-1177(81)90241-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of microorganisms have intimate [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] with other larger organisms; some of which are mutually beneficial ([[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]), while others can be damaging to the [[host (biology)|host]] organism ([[parasitism]]).

=== Hygiene ===
{{Main|Hygiene |Food microbiology}}

Hygiene is a set of practices to avoid [[infection]] or [[food spoilage]] by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular [[bacteria]], are found virtually everywhere, [[pathogen|harmful microorganisms]] may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by [[Food preservation|preservation]] methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an [[autoclave]] is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/hygiene/en/|title=Hygiene |publisher=World Health Organization (WHO) |accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/consumer/5keys/en/ |title=The Five Keys to Safer Food Programme |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Book of Genesis]], the '''mountains of Ararat''' ([[Biblical Hebrew]] {{script/Hebrew|הָרֵי אֲרָרָט}}, [[Tiberian Hebrew|Tiberian]] ''{{lang|he-Latn|hārēy Ǎrārāṭ}}'', [[Septuagint]]: {{lang|grc|τὰ [[:wikt:ὄρος|ὄρη]] τὰ Ἀραράτ}}){{citation needed|date=June 2018}} is the term used to designate the region in which [[Noah's Ark]] comes to rest after the [[Great Flood (Biblical)|Great Flood]].&lt;ref name="genesis84"&gt;{{cite web |title=Genesis 8:4 |url=http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-4.htm |website=Bible Hub |publisher=Online Parallel Bible Project |accessdate=8 June 2018 |ref=genesis84}}&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to [[Akkadian language|ancient Assyrian]] [[Urartu]], an [[exonym]] for the Kingdom of Van.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==History==

Citing historians [[Berossus]], [[Hieronymus the Egyptian]], [[Mnaseas]], and [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], [[Josephus]] writes in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' that "[t]he ark rested on the top of a certain mountain in [[Armenia]], . . . over [[Minyans|Minyas]], called Baris."&lt;ref name="josephus"&gt;{{PACEJ|text=ants|bookno=1|chap=3|sec=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, in the [[Latin Vulgate]], [[Jerome]] translates Genesis 8:4 to read: "''requievitque arca . . . super montes Armeniae''" ("and the ark rested . . . on the mountains of Armenia");&lt;ref name="latinvulgategen84"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Book of Genesis: Chapter 8 |url=http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=1&amp;c=8#8_4 |website=LatinVulgate.com |publisher=Mental Systems, Inc. |accessdate=8 June 2018 |ref=latinvulgategen84}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in the ''[[Nova Vulgata]]'' as promulgated after the [[Second Vatican Council]], the [[toponym]] is amended to "''montes Ararat''" ("mountains of Ararat").&lt;ref name="novavulgatagen84"&gt;{{cite web |title=Liber Genesis |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/bible/nova_vulgata/documents/nova-vulgata_vt_genesis_lt.html#8 |website=Nova Vulgata: Bibliorum Sacrorum Editio |publisher=The Holy See |accessdate=8 June 2018 |ref=novavulgatagen84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, early [[Syrian]] and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] tradition placed the ark on [[Mount Judi]] in what is today [[Şırnak Province]], [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]],&lt;ref name="conybeare1901"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Conybeare |first=Frederick Cornwallis |author-link=Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare |title=Reviewed Work: ''Ararat und Masis.

The [[Book of Jubilees]] specifies that the ark came to rest on the peak of [[Lubar (mountain)|Lubar]], a mountain of Ararat.&lt;ref name="jubilees"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Book of Jubilees: Chapter 7 |url=http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/jubilees/7.htm |website=Pseudepigrapha, Apocrypha and Sacred Writings |accessdate=8 June 2018 |ref=jubilees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Walter Raleigh]] devotes several chapters of his ''[[Sir Walter Raleigh#History Book|Historie of the World]]'' (1614) to an argument that in ancient times the mountains of Ararat were understood to include not only those of Armenia, but also all of the taller mountain ranges extending into [[Asia]]. He maintains that since Armenia is not actually located east of [[Shinar]],{{refn|group=notes|name=eastofshinar|See Genesis 11:2 in the [[King James Bible]], following the [[Septuagint]]: "And it came to pass, as [the descendants of [[Noah]]] journeyed ''from the east'' (Septuagint: ''ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν''),&lt;ref name="septuagintgen112"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bereishit (Genesis) 11 :: Septuagint (LXX) |url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/lxx/gen/11/2/s_11002 |website=Blue Letter Bible |publisher=Blue Letter Bible |accessdate=20 June 2018 |ref=septuagintgen112}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there." Ararat is in fact located to the ''northwest'' of Shinar; hence many translations depart from the Septuagint here, rendering the prepositional phrase as "eastward" or "to the east."&lt;ref name="kjvgen112"&gt;{{cite web |title=Genesis 11:2 |url=http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-2.htm |website=Bible Hub |publisher=Online Parallel Bible Project |accessdate=20 June 2018 |ref=kjvgen112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy is discussed extensively in biblical commentaries&lt;ref name="commentariesgen112"&gt;{{cite web |title=Commentaries: Genesis 11:2 |url=http://biblehub.com/commentaries/genesis/11-2.htm |website=Bible Hub |publisher=Online Parallel Bible Project |accessdate=20 June 2018 |ref=commentariesgen112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kolatch |first1=Yonatan |title=Masters of the Word: Traditional Jewish Bible Commentary from the First Through Tenth Centuries, Volume 1 |date=2006 |publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc. |location=Jersey City, New Jersey |isbn=0-88125-936-5 |page=214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P9G4qAHWtVgC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=%22east+of+shinar%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_kH7LvY7Ai&amp;sig=jdj3hu_i-q8eVYfFue7Hj7zJNBc&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7qoOlyeHbAhUrwVkKHaALDlIQ6AEIQzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22east%20of%20shinar%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 June 2018 |ref=yonatan2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="basegen112"&gt;{{cite web |title=Noah's Ark: The Ark of Noah in Iran? |url=http://www.baseinstitute.org/pages/noahs_ark/17 |website=BASE Institute |publisher=The Bible Archaeology, Search &amp; Exploration (BASE) Institute |accessdate=20 June 2018 |ref=basegen112}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} the ark must have landed somewhere in the [[Orient]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In [[Mapuche mythology]], '''Ngen''' are [[spirit]]s of [[nature]] of the [[Mapuche]] beliefs. In [[Mapudungun]], the word ''nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;'' means "owner".

==Legend==
The Ngen are those that manage, govern and arrange the different features of nature; but also those that nature takes care of and protects. The Ngen were created by the ''[[Pu-am]]'' (the representation of the universal [[soul]]), who wanted the Ngen to assure the order and the laws of ''[[admapu]]'' (rules of the Mapuche tradition); and they prevent commotion such as the one caused by the battle of the ''[[pillan]]'' before the beginning of time. The Ngen receive orders of the ''Pu-am'' and of [[Antu (mapuche mythology)|A&lt;u&gt;nt&lt;/u&gt;ü]] (the most powerful ''pillan'' spirit).

If a Mapuche needs to obtain something from nature, they must respect and give an offering to the specific Ngen spirit. 

The Ngen take on forms that are based on humans, animals, and plants. Each type of Ngen spirit receives a specific name. 

*''[[Ngenechen]]'' (''Nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;-che''): spirit or deity who governs human beings
*''Nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;-mapu'': owners of the Earth 
*''Nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;-wingkul'': owners of the hills or volcanos
*''Nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;-kütral'': owner of the fire
*''Nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;-ko'': owners of the water
*''Nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;-kürüf'': owners of the winds
*''Nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;-mawida'': owners of the forest
*''Nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;-kulliñ'': owners of the animals
*''Nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;-&lt;u&gt;l&lt;/u&gt;awe&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;'': owner of the medicinal herbs
*''Nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;-kura'': owners of the stones
*''Nge&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;-rüpü'': owners of the paths created by nature or the footsteps of wild animals

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2729">[[Croatia]] has no [[nuclear power plants]] on its territory. Croatia co-owns the [[Krško Nuclear Power Plant]] together with [[Nuclear energy in Slovenia|Slovenia]]; the Krško plant was built in the era of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] on the territory of present-day [[Slovenia]]. As of 2008, 17% of Croatia's electric energy consumption is supplied by Krško plant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/43301/2014-hrvatska-bez-nuklearke-u-mraku | title=2014.

In 1978, the Adriatic island of [[Vir]] was selected as a location for a future nuclear power plant, but these plans were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/10970/rajski-otok-za-divlju-gradnju | title=Rajski otok za divlju gradnju | magazine=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] | issue=441 | date=27 April 2004 | language=Croatian | accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to reports, since 2009 Croatia has been discussing the option of building a nuclear power plant with [[Nuclear energy in Albania|Albania]], in a location on the shore of [[Shkodër Lake]], on the border with [[Albania]] and [[Montenegro]]. In April 2009 Croatian government denied that any agreement had been signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.climatesceptics.org/europe/albania/croatia-denies-nuclear-plant-contract | title=Croatia Denies Nuclear Plant Contract | date=21 April 2009 | work=climatesceptics.org | accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 poll among 447 Croatian citizens, who were asked "Do you think it is justified to use nuclear energy for the production of electricity?", 42% answered "yes" and 44% answered "no".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/107814|title=Stav javnosti o potrebi izgradnje odlagališta radioaktivnog otpada u Republici Hrvatskoj|trans-title=Public opinion on necessity for construction of repository in the Republic of Croatia|journal=Rudarsko-geološko-naftni zbornik|publisher=Faculty of Mining, Geology and Petroleum Engineering, [[University of Zagreb]]|volume=24|issue=1|date=July 2012|pages=73–80|language=hr|format=PDF|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory''' ('''PMEL''') is a laboratory in the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR). It is one of seven NOAA Research Laboratories (RLs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NOAA Research Laboratories |publisher = NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research |date = |url = http://ci.noaa.gov/NOAAResearchLaboratories.aspx |accessdate = 2014-04-26 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PMEL is split across two sites in the Pacific Northwest, in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Newport, Oregon|Newport]], [[Oregon]].

==Research==
PMEL carries out interdisciplinary scientific investigations in [[oceanography]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] science to improve our understanding of the complex physical and [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] processes operating in the world [[ocean]]s, especially the [[Pacific Ocean]], to define the forcing functions and the processes driving [[Ocean current|ocean circulation]] and the global [[climate]] system, and to improve environmental forecasting capabilities and other supporting services for marine commerce and [[Fishery|fisheries]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3199">[[Particle physics]], which deals with the interactions of elementary particles at high energies, is an important component of [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of the [[early universe]], when the universe was dominated by radiation and its average energy density was very high. Because of this, [[pair production]], [[scattering]] processes and [[Particle decay|decay]] of unstable particles are important in cosmology, and the interface between particle physics and cosmology is sometimes referred to as '''particle cosmology'''.

As a thumb rule, a scattering or a decay process is cosmologically important in a certain cosmological epoch if its relevant time scale is smaller or even to the time scale of the universe expansion, which is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{H}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; being the time-dependent [[Hubble parameter]]. This is roughly equal to the age of the universe at that time.

For example, the [[pion]] has a [[mean lifetime|lifetime]] of about 26 [[nanosecond]]s. This means that particle physics processes involving pions did not take place until roughly that much time passed since the start of the [[Big Bang]].

Cosmological observations of phenomena such as the [[cosmic microwave background]] and the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|cosmic abundance of elements]], together with the predictions of the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, place constraints on the conditions of the early universe. The success of the Standard Model at explaining these observations provides a confirmation of its validity outside of laboratory conditions. In addition, phenomena extrapolated from cosmological observations, such as [[dark matter]] and [[CP-violation]], suggest a need for physics that goes [[beyond the Standard Model]].

[[File:Kilconnell Friary O'Donellan Chapel Double Piscina 2009 09 16.jpg|thumb|16th-century double piscina at the Franciscan friary in [[Kilconnell]]]]
A '''piscina''' is a shallow basin placed near the [[altar]] of a [[church architecture|church]], or else in the [[vestry]] or [[sacristy]], used for washing the [[communion vessel]]s. The '''sacrarium''' is the drain itself. Anglicans usually refer to the basin, calling it a piscina. Roman Catholics usually refer to the drain, and by extension, the  basin, as the sacrarium. They are often made of stone and fitted with a drain, and are in some cases used to dispose of materials used in the sacraments and water from liturgical ablutions.  They are found in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches, and a similar vessel is used in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches.

==History==
The ''piscina'' is a [[Latin]] word originally applied to a [[fish]]-[[pond]], and later used for natural or artificial [[swimming pool|pool]]s for [[bathing]], and also for a water tank or [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Piscina |volume=21 |page=651 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[ecclesiastic]]al usage it was applied to the basin used for [[Ablution in Christianity|ablutions]] and sometimes other sacraments.

They were originally named for the baptismal font.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Piscina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piscinae seem at first to have been mere cups or small basins, supported on perforated stems, placed close to the wall, and afterwards to have been recessed therein and covered with [[niche (architecture)|niche]] heads, which often contained shelves to serve as [[ambry|ambries]]. They were rare in [[England]] until the 13th century, after which there is scarcely an altar without one. They frequently take the form of a double niche, with a shaft between the [[arch]]ed heads, which are often filled with elaborate tracery.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;  If there is no drain, a niche for washing is a [[lavabo]], though the usage of the two terms is confused.

==Usage==
The purpose of the piscina or sacrarium is to dispose of water used sacramentally, by returning these particles directly to the earth.  For this reason, it is connected by a pipe directly to the ground; otherwise presumably a basin was used.

At times the piscina has been used for disposal of other items, such as old [[baptism]]al water, [[Holy Oil (Christianity)|holy oil]]s, and leftover ashes from [[Ash Wednesday]]. {{cn span|A common myth is that  consecrated wine was also poured down the piscina. Actually, the rubrics stated that clearly any consecrated Blood of Christ that is left over after [[Holy Communion|communion]] is consumed either by the priest or by those who assist in the distribution of the [[Eucharist]] (the [[Extraordinary minister of Holy Communion|extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion]]), there has never  been a time when the Precious Blood was officially poured down the drain. What caused this confusion is that in countries with plenty of cheap wine, if there was any unconsecrated wine left in a cruet, that wine was washed down the piscina.|date=May 2018}}

In the Roman Catholic Church, pouring the consecrated wine, the Blood of Christ, or the Host down a sacrarium is almost never permitted.&lt;ref&gt;''Redemptionis Sacramentum'' 107&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely rarely, the Eucharistic species spoils or becomes contaminated such that it cannot be consumed. The host is then dissolved in water until it disappears, then the water is poured down into the sacrarium.&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.catholic.com/showthread.php?t=765591&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable-inline|certain=y|reason=WP:SPS|date=May 2018}} In accordance with what is laid down by the [[canon law|canons]], "one who throws away the consecrated species or takes them away or keeps them for a sacrilegious purpose, incurs a ''[[latae sententiae]]'' [[excommunication]] reserved to the [[Apostolic See]]; a [[cleric]], moreover, may be punished by another penalty, not excluding dismissal from the clerical state."&lt;ref&gt;''Redemptionis Sacramentum'' 194&lt;/ref&gt; This applies to any action that is voluntarily and gravely disrespectful of the sacred species. Anyone, therefore, who acts contrary to these norms, for example casting the sacred species into the sacrarium or in an unworthy place or on the ground, incurs the penalties laid down.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts'', Response to dubium, 3 July 1999: AAS 91 (1999) p. 918.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern Christianity==
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] the piscina is called a '''thalassidion''', and is located in the [[diaconicon]] (sacristy). The thalassidion is a sink that drains into an honorable place in the ground where liquids such as the water used to wash holy things may be poured, and where the clergy may wash their hands before serving the [[Divine Liturgy]]. In Orthodoxy the [[Sacred Mysteries]] (consecrated elements) are never poured into the thalassidion, but must always be consumed by a [[deacon]] or priest.

In some ancient churches, the thalassidion was placed under the [[Holy Table]] (altar), though now it is almost always located in the diaconicon. At one time, before a [[monk]] or [[nun]] was [[tonsure]]d, their [[religious habit]] would be placed on the thalassidion;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Robinson | first =Nalbro' Frazier  | year =1911 | title =Monasticism in the Orthodox Churches | pages = | publisher =AMS Press | isbn =978-0-404-05375-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; now, since the separation of the thalassidion from the Holy Table, the habit is placed on the Holy Table. When a [[monk]] or [[nun]] is [[tonsure]]d, if the hair must be disposed of, it is thrown into the thalassidion.

'''Plucking''', also referred to as '''quarrying''', is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large "joint blocks". This occurs in a type of glacier called a "valley glacier". As a [[glacier]] moves down a valley, friction causes the [[basal sliding|basal]] ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier.

In this way, plucking has been linked to [[regelation]].&lt;ref name=PluckWatPress /&gt; Rocks of all sizes can become trapped in the bottom of the glacier. Joint blocks up to three meters have been "plucked" and transported.&lt;ref name=Whipple/&gt; These entrained rock fragments can also cause [[abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] along the subsequent bedrock and walls. Plucking also leads to [[chatter marks]], wedge shaped indentations left on the bedrock or other rock surfaces.&lt;ref name=EG&gt;Essentials of Geology, 3rd ed., Stephen Marshak&lt;/ref&gt; Glacial plucking both exploits pre-existing fractures in the bedrock and requires continued fracturing to maintain the cycle of erosion.&lt;ref name=ERO /&gt; Glacial plucking is most significant where the rock surface is well jointed  or fractured or where it contains exposed bed planes, as this allows meltwater and clasts to penetrate more easily.&lt;ref name=Whipple/&gt;

Plucking of bedrock also occurs in steep upland rivers, and shares a number of similarities with glacial examples. In such cases, the loosening and detachment of blocks appears to result from a combination of (1) chemical and physical weathering along joints, (2) hydraulic wedging driven by smaller rock fragments getting into existing cracks, (3) crack propagation from stresses caused by impacts of large clasts already in transport by the river, and possibly (4) crack propagation driven by flexing resulting from pressure variation in the overlying water during floods. Loosened blocks are then carried away by fast flowing water during large floods, though the entrainment is believed to be significantly less efficient than the equivalent ability of ice to carry away blocks under glaciers.&lt;ref name=Whipple/&gt;

==Plucking mechanisms==
Glacial plucking is largely dependent on the amount of stress exerted on a [[clastic rock|clast]] overlain by glacial ice. This relationship is a balance between the shear stress exerted on the clast and the normal pressure on the clast by a body of ice. Plucking is increased where there are preexisting fractures in a rock bed. As the glacier slides down a mountain, energy from friction, pressure or geothermal heat causes glacial meltwater to infiltrate the spaces between rocks.&lt;ref name=ERO /&gt; This process, known as [[frost weathering|frost wedging]], puts stress on the rock structure as water expands when it freezes. Impacts from large clasts carried in the bedload can cause additional stress to the bedrock.&lt;ref name=Bierman /&gt;  Additionally, plucking can be seen as a [[positive feedback]] system in which the increased action of rock removed from the landscape entrained in the glacier causes larger scale fracturing further down the glacier because of a heavier load of force pushing down on the rock bed.&lt;ref name=ERO /&gt;

==Mechanical erosion==
Glacial plucking is the main mechanism of other small scale mechanical glacial erosion such as [[striation (geology)|striation]], [[abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] and [[glacial polish]]ing. The heavier the sediment load, the more extreme the erosion of the downhill landscape. Erosion is largely dependent on the amount of water flow and its velocity, the clast size and hardness with relation to the stability of the slope.&lt;ref name=ERO /&gt;

===Glacial striation===
A rock that has been subject to glacial erosion will often show a [[Glacial striation|striation]] pattern in which the rock appears scratched. Long parallel lines will cover the rock and show the appearance of something having been dragged along the top of it. Although striations can form on any sort of rock, they are usually present on more stable bedrock such as quartzite or granite where erosion processes are more readily preserved.&lt;ref name=Utah /&gt; Striations, because of their nature of erosion, can also tell geologists the path and movement of the glacier.

===Polishing===
Glacial polishing is the result of clasts embedded in glacial ice passing over bedrock and grinding down the top of the rock into a smoother surface. The small rocks entrained by plucking act like sandpaper to the downhill slope.&lt;ref name=Tulane /&gt;  This creates an almost mirror like surface in the rock. Polish indicates a more recent process as it is often lost to weathering of the rock surface.

==Glacial till==
The joint blocks and rock fragments that are entrained and carried down the slope can be deposited as [[till]]. This leads to a whole set of depositional glacial landforms such as [[moraine]]s, [[roche moutonnée]]s, [[glacial erratic]]s and [[drumlin field]]s.

[[File:Banded iron formation Dales Gorge.jpg|thumb|A Siderian banded iron formation in Dales Gorge, [[Western Australia]]]]

The '''Siderian Period''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|s|aɪ|ˈ|d|ɪər|i|ən}}; {{lang-el|σίδηρος|translit=sídēros}}, meaning "iron") is the first [[geologic]] [[geologic period|period]] in the [[Paleoproterozoic]] [[era (geology)|Era]] and lasted from {{Period start|Siderian}} [[annum|Ma]] to {{Period start|Rhyacian}} Ma (million years ago). Instead of being based on [[stratigraphy]], these dates are defined [[Absolute dating|chronometrically]].

The laying down of the [[banded iron formation]]s (BIFs) peaked early in this period. BIFs were formed as anaerobic [[cyanobacteria]] produced waste [[oxygen]] that combined with [[iron]], forming [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, an [[iron oxide]]). This process removed iron from the Earth's oceans, presumably turning greenish seas clear. Eventually, with no remaining iron in the oceans to serve as an oxygen sink, the process allowed the buildup of an oxygen-rich [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. This second, follow-on event is known as the [[oxygen catastrophe]], which, some geologists believe triggered the [[Huronian glaciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Paleoclimates: The First Two Billion Years |first1=James F. |last1=Kasting |first2=Shuehi |last2=Ono |year=2006 |journal=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences |volume=361 |issue=1470 |pages=917–929 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1839 |jstor=20209693|pmc=1868609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Paleoproterozoic Snowball Earth: A climate disaster triggered by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis |first1=Robert E. |last1=Kopp |first2=Joseph L. |last2=Kirschvink |first3=Isaac A. |last3=Hilburn |first4=Cody Z. |last4=Nash |journal=PNAS |year=2005 |volume=102 |issue=32 |pages=11131–11136 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0504878102|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/1015/1/KOPpnas05.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the time period from 2420&amp;nbsp;Ma to 2250&amp;nbsp;Ma is well-defined by the lower edge of iron-deposition layers, an alternative period named the '''Oxygenian''', based on stratigraphy instead of chronometry, was suggested in 2012 by Gradstein ''et al.'' in a geological timescale review &lt;ref name="Gradstein_et_al_2012"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Geologic Time Scale 2012 |publisher=Elsevier |editor1-last=Gradstein |editor1-first=F.

Such nanowires have promising applications in lithium ion batteries and [[sensors]]. Initial synthesis of SiNWs is often accompanied by [[thermal oxidation]] steps to yield structures of accurately tailored size and morphology.&lt;ref name="slo"&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Liu| first1=M.| last2= Peng |first2=J.| display-authors= etal |title=  ''Two-dimensional modeling of the self-limiting oxidation in silicon and tungsten nanowires'' | journal= Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Letters  | year= 2016 |  volume=6 | issue=5 | pages=195–199 | url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306273009 | doi= 10.1016/j.taml.2016.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SiNWs have unique properties that are not seen in bulk (three-dimensional) silicon materials. These properties arise from an unusual quasi one-dimensional electronic structure and are the subject of research across numerous disciplines and applications. The reason that SiNWs are considered as one of the most important one-dimensional materials is they could have a function as building blocks for nanoscale electronics assembled without the need for complex and costly fabrication facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yi|first=Cui|last2=Charles M.|first2=Lieber|date=|year=2001|title=Functional Nanoscale Electronic Devices Assembled Using Silicon Nanowire Building Blocks|url=|journal=Science|volume=291|issue=5505|pages=851–853|doi=10.1126/science.291.5505.851|pmid=11157160|via=|bibcode=2001Sci...291..851C}}&lt;/ref&gt; SiNWs are frequently studied towards applications including [[photovoltaics]], [[nanowire batteries]], [[thermoelectrics]] and non-volatile memory.&lt;ref name="miko"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Mikolajick | first1=Thomas | last2= Heinzig |first2= Andre |last3= Trommer | first3= Jens | display-authors= etal  |title= Silicon nanowires–a versatile technology platform | journal= Physica Status Solidi RRL  | year= 2013| volume=7 |issue=10 | pages= 793–799 | doi=10.1002/pssr.201307247|bibcode=2013PSSRR...7..793M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, silicon nanowires are a promising candidate for a wide range of applications that draw on their unique physico-chemical characteristics, which differ from those of bulk [[silicon]] material.&lt;ref name="slo" /&gt;

SiNWs exhibit charge trapping behavior which renders such systems of value in applications necessitating electron hole separation such as photovoltaics, and photocatalysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Tsakalakos | first1= L. | last2= Balch |first2= J. |last3= Fronheiser | first3= J. | last4= Korevaar | first4=B.|title= Silicon nanowire solar cells | journal= Applied Physics Letters | year= 2007| volume= 91 |issue= 23 | pages= 233117 | doi=10.1063/1.2821113|bibcode= 2007ApPhL..91w3117T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experiment on nanowire solar cells has led to a remarkable improvement of the power conversion efficiency of SiNW solar cells from &lt;1% to &gt;17% in the last few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu|first=Peng|last2=Wu|first2=Jiang|last3=Liu|first3=Shenting|last4=Xiong|first4=Jie|last5=Jagadish|first5=Chennupati|last6=Wang|first6=Zhiming M.|date=2016-12-01|title=Design and fabrication of silicon nanowires towards efficient solar cells|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1748013216302110|journal=Nano Today|volume=11|issue=6|pages=704–737|doi=10.1016/j.nantod.2016.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charge trapping behaviour and tuneable surface governed transport properties of SiNWs render this category of nanostructures of interest towards use as metal insulator semiconductors and [[MOSFET|field effect transistors]], with further applications as nanoelectronic storage devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Tian | first1=Bozhi | last2= Xiaolin |first2= Zheng|display-authors= etal  |title= Coaxial silicon nanowires as solar cells and nanoelectronic power sources | journal= Nature| year= 2007 | volume= 449 |issue= 7164| pages= 885–889 | doi=10.1038/nature06181| pmid=17943126 |bibcode= 2007Natur.449..885T}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[flash memory]], [[Programmable logic device|logic devices]] as well as chemical and biological [[sensors]].&lt;ref name="miko" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Daniel | first1=Shir | display-authors=etal  |title= Oxidation of silicon nanowires | journal= Journal of Vacuum Science &amp; Technology | year= 2006 | volume= 24 |issue= 3 | pages= 1333–1336 | doi= 10.1116/1.2198847 | bibcode=2006JVSTB..24.1333S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability for [[lithium]] ions to [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalate]] into silicon structures renders various Si [[nanostructures]] of interest towards applications as [[anodes]] in [[Lithium-ion battery|Li-ion batteries (LiBs)]]. SiNWs are of particular merit as such anodes as they exhibit the ability to undergo significant lithiation while maintaining structural integrity and electrical connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Chan | first1= C.| last2= Peng |first2= H. |display-authors= etal |title= High-performance lithium battery anodes using silicon nanowires | journal= Nature Nanotechnology | year= 2008| volume= 3|issue= 1| pages= 31–35 | doi=10.1038/nnano.2007.411| pmid= 18654447|bibcode= 2008NatNa...3...31C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==

Several synthesis methods are known for SiNWs and these can be broadly divided into methods which start with bulk silicon and remove material to yield nanowires, also known as top-down synthesis, and methods which use a chemical or vapor precursor to build nanowires in a process generally considered to be bottom-up synthesis.&lt;ref name="miko" /&gt;

===Top down synthesis methods===

These methods use material removal techniques to produce nanostructures from a bulk precursor

*[[Laser ablation|Laser beam ablation]]&lt;ref name="miko" /&gt;
*Ion beam etching&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Huang  | first1=Z. | last2= Fang |first2=H. |last3= Zhu | first3= J.  |title= Fabrication of silicon nanowire arrays with controlled diameter, length, and density | journal= Advanced Materials  | year=2007| volume=19 |issue=5 | pages= 744–748 | doi=10.1002/adma.200600892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bottom-up synthesis methods===

*[[Vapor–liquid–solid method|Vapour liquid solid (VLS)]] growth – a type of catalysed [[Chemical vapor deposition|CVD]] often using [[silane]] as Si precursor and gold nanoparticles as catalyst (or 'seed').&lt;ref name="miko" /&gt; 
*[[Molecular beam epitaxy]] – a form of [[Physical vapor deposition|PVD]] applied in plasma environment&lt;ref name="shao" /&gt;
*Precipitation from a solution – A variation of the VLS method, aptly named supercritical fluid liquid solid (SFLS), that uses a [[supercritical fluid]] (e.g. organosilane at high temperature and pressure) as Si precursor instead of vapor. The catalyst would be a colloid in solution, such as [[colloidal gold]] nanoparticles, and the SiNWs are grown in this solution&lt;ref name="shao" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Holmes | first1=J. | last2=Keith  |first2= P. |last3=Johnston | first3=R. | last4=Doty| first4=C.|title= Control of thickness and orientation of solution-grown silicon nanowires | journal= Science | year=2000| volume=287 |issue= 5457| pages= 1471–1473 | doi=10.1126/science.287.5457.1471|bibcode=2000Sci...287.1471H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal oxidation===

Subsequent to physical or chemical processing, either top-down or bottom-up, to obtain initial silicon nanostructures, thermal oxidation steps are often applied in order to obtain materials with desired size and [[aspect ratio]]. Silicon nanowires exhibit a distinct and useful self-limiting [[oxidation]] behaviour whereby oxidation effectively ceases due to [[diffusion]] limitations, which can be modeled.&lt;ref name="slo" /&gt; This phenomenon allows accurate control of dimensions and aspect ratios in SiNWs and has been used to obtain high aspect ratio SiNWs with diameters below 5&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Liu | first1= H.I. | last2= Biegelsen |first2=D.K. |last3=Ponce | first3=F.A. | last4=Johnson | first4=N.M.|  last5=Pease | first5=R.F.W.|title= Self-limiting oxidation for fabricating sub-5 nm silicon nanowires | journal= | year=|issue=| pages=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The self-limiting oxidation of SiNWs is of value towards lithium ion battery materials.

==Orientation of nanowires==

The orientation of SiNWs has profound influence on the strucutal and electronic properties of  the systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Justo|first1=J.F.|last2=Menezes|first2=R.D.|last3=Assali|first3=L.V.C.|title=Stability and plasticity of silicon nanowires: The role of wire perimeter|journal=Phys. Rev. B|date=2007|volume=75|issue=4|page=045303|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.75.045303|arxiv=1307.3274|bibcode=2007PhRvB..75d5303J}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason several procedures have been proposed for the alignment of nanowires in chosen orientations. This includes the use of electric fields in polar alignment, [[electrophoresis]], mircofluidic methods and contact printing.

==Outlook==

There is significant interest in SiNWs for their unique properties and the ability to control size and aspect ratio with great accuracy. As yet, limitations in large-scale fabrication impede the uptake of this material in the full range of investigated applications. Combined studies of synthesis methods, oxidation kinetics and properties of SiNW systems aim to overcome the present limitations and facilitate the implementation of SiNW systems, for example, high quality vapor-liquid-solid–grown SiNWs with smooth surfaces can be reversibly stretched with 10% or more elastic strain, approaching the theoretical elastic limit of silicon, which could open the doors for the emerging “elastic strain engineering” and flexible bio-/nano-electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Zhang | first1= H. | last2= Tersoff |first2=J. |last3=Xu | first3=S. | display-authors=etal |title= Approaching the ideal elastic strain limit in silicon nanowires | journal=Science Advances | year=2016| volume=2 |issue=8| pages=e1501382 | url= http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/8/e1501382 | doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501382| pmid= 27540586 | pmc= 4988777 |bibcode=2016SciA....2E1382Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soil resilience''' refers to the ability of a [[soil]] to resist or recover their [[soil health|healthy]] state in response to destabilising influences. This is a subset of a notion of ''[[Resilience (ecology)|environmental resilience]]''.

==Overview==

Soil resilience should first be looked at in terms of soil formation and development ([[pedogenesis]]), a continuous process taking thousands of years – this puts into context the short time that humans have so extensively utilised, changed and depended directly on soil. Pedogenesis is the result of five factors: the first two are parent material and topography, which are passive and contribute to soil mass and position; the next two are [[climate]] and the [[biosphere]], which are active and supply the energy in soil formation. Finally, there is time.&lt;ref&gt;* Paton, TR 1978, The formation of soil material, George Allen and Unwin, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the active factors in soil formation that vary so as to constitute an [[environmental change]] or shock. Over time, variations have been significant:

*Over millions of years the soil has endured varying atmospheric conditions including a complete absence of [[oxygen]] and associated behaviour of soil elements in a [[reducing agent|reducing]] environment, and the establishment of life - particularly of terrestrial vegetation [[Paleozoic|420 million years]] ago.
*Over ten thousand years and following the last [[ice age]], though average climate has remained relatively stable, the soil has faced periods of extended wet, dry and fire.

If soil were not resilient, then in the face of past influences it would not be in any condition to support the natural and commercial services that we expect of it currently. So what do we expect of soil resilience?

*Constant or evolving state? - Do we expect that the soil to remain constant – to continue to provide the same [[environmental services|environmental]] and commercial services as at present, or; that it will establish a new [[ecological equilibrium|equilibrium]]?
*How long will it take? - How long do we expect soils to ‘hold out’ or adjust, and are we realistic about pedological time?

==Australian context==

In [[Australia]], the above questions are relevant given the strong dependence on the soil, yet the significant [[soil degradation|degradation of soils]] over little more than 200 years due to adoption of European styled [[agriculture]]. This is in the context of the real prospect of [[climate change]], [[cyclical drought]] and other degrading affects.

It is in the interest of humans to sustain soils as this is the essence of our existence:&lt;ref&gt;Baskin, Y 1997, The work of nature, The Scientific Community on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE), Island Press, Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; the maintenance of [[soil fertility|fertile soil]] is “one of the most vital ecological services the living world performs”; the “mineral and organic contents of soil must be replenished constantly as plants consume soil elements and pass them up the [[food chain]]”.

It is claimed by Watson (1992) that the [[ecosystem]]s of Australia, which have evolved over millennia, have been decimated over the last 200 years. Our expectation has been one of ongoing environmental and commercial service, yet the practices applied have been unsustainable and have led to such soil related problems as salinity, acidity, nutrient decline, erosion and structure decline.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, C 1992, An ecologically unsustainable agriculture (pp 19–32), in Lawrence, G, Vanclay, FM &amp; Furze, B 1992, Agriculture, environment and society, contemporary issues for Australia, The Macmillan Company of Australia Pty Ltd, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrow (1991) claims that despite decades of humans talking of an impending environmental crisis, including the breaking point of our soils’ fertility, threats to the environment have continued to grow faster than the willingness to control them. Even with good intentions and best [[farming]] practices, still we are caught out by drought and wet periods, which cause unsustainable degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow, CJ 1991, Land Degradation, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

The pressure that we impose on the soil in terms of biosphere (direct [[human impact on the environment|human impacts]] included) and climate constitute [[environmental change]] – the rate of this change compared to other changes over pedological time constitutes a shock. The resilience of the soil is limited by the rate and extent of change we impose compared with the time that soil requires to recover.

==Conclusion==
Soils are resilient to environmental changes and shocks – that is, they will recover from or adjust to change if sufficient ‘pedological’ time is allowed. The [[soil management]] practices that have been applied by humans in a short time frame are unsustainable - a declining soil health threatens human livelihood.  The resilience of the soil in terms of human expectations and time frames will depend on its ability to recover to an equilibrium state once improved practices have been extensively applied.

'''Soil structure''' describes the arrangement of the solid parts of the [[soil]] and of the pore space located between them. It is determined by how individual soil [[:wikt:granule|granules]] clump, bind together, and aggregate, resulting in the arrangement of soil pores between them. Soil structure has a major influence on water and air movement, [[Soil microbiology|biological activity]], [[root]] growth and [[seedling]] emergence.

== Overview ==
Soil structure describes the arrangement of the solid parts of the soil and of the pore spaces located between them (Marshall &amp;amp; Holmes, 1979).&lt;ref name="Dexter1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dexter|first1=A.R.|title=Advances in characterization of soil structure |journal=Soil and Tillage Research|date=June 1988 |volume=11|issue=3-4|pages=199–238|doi=10.1016/0167-1987(88)90002-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aggregation is the result of the interaction of soil particles through rearrangement, flocculation and cementation. It is enhanced by:&lt;ref name="Dexter1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masoom |first1=Hussain|last2=Courtier-Murias|first2=Denis |last3=Farooq |first3=Hashim|last4=Soong|first4=Ronald|last5=Kelleher|first5=Brian P.|last6=Zhang |first6=Chao|last7=Maas |first7=Werner E. |last8=Fey|first8=Michael|last9=Kumar|first9=Rajeev |last10=Monette|first10=Martine|last11=Stronks|first11=Henry J. |last12=Simpson |first12=Myrna J.|last13=Simpson|first13=André J.|title=Soil Organic Matter in Its Native State: Unravelling the Most Complex Biomaterial on Earth|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=16 February 2016 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=1670–1680 |doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b03410}}&lt;/ref&gt; the precipitation of oxides, hydroxides, carbonates and silicates; the products of biological activity (such as [[biofilms]], [[Hypha|fungal hyphae]] and [[glycoproteins]]); ionic bridging between negatively charged particles (both clay minerals and organic compounds) by multivalent cations; and interactions between organic compounds ([[hydrogen bonding]] and [[hydrophobic]] bonding).

The quality of soil structure will decline under most forms of [[Tillage|cultivation]]—the associated mechanical mixing of the soil compacts and shears aggregates and fills pore spaces; it also exposes organic matter to a greater rate of decay and [[oxidation]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, A &amp;amp; Young R 2001, ''Soils in the Australian landscape'', Oxford University Press, Melbourne. {{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further consequence of continued cultivation and traffic is the development of [[soil compaction|compacted]], impermeable layers or 'pans' within the profile.

The decline of soil structure under [[irrigation]] is usually related to the breakdown of aggregates and dispersion of [[clay]] material as a result of rapid wetting. This is particularly so if soils are [[sodic soils|sodic]]; that is, having a high exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of the [[cation]]s attached to the clays. High sodium levels (compared to high [[calcium]] levels) cause particles to repel one another when wet, and the associated aggregates to disaggregate and disperse. The ESP will increase if irrigation causes salty water (even of low concentration) to gain access to the soil.

A wide range of practices are undertaken to preserve and improve soil structure. For example, the NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation advocates: increasing organic content by incorporating pasture phases into [[crop rotation|cropping rotations]]; reducing or eliminating [[tillage]] and cultivation in cropping and pasture activities; avoiding soil disturbance during periods of excessive dry or wet when soils may accordingly tend to shatter or smear; and ensuring sufficient ground cover to protect the soil from raindrop impact. In irrigated agriculture, it may be recommended to: apply gypsum ([[calcium sulfate]]) to displace sodium cations with calcium and so reduce ESP or sodicity, avoid rapid wetting, and avoid disturbing soils when too wet or dry.&lt;ref name=NSW1991/&gt;

===Impacts of improving soil structure===
The benefits of improving soil structure for the growth of plants, particularly in an agricultural setting include: reduced [[erosion]] due to greater soil aggregate strength and decreased overland flow; improved root penetration and access to soil moisture and nutrients; improved emergence of seedlings due to reduced crusting of the surface; and greater water infiltration, [[water retention curve|retention]] and availability due to improved porosity.

It has been estimated that productivity from irrigated perennial [[horticulture]] could be increased by two to three times the present level by improving soil structure, because of the resulting access by plants to available soil water and nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Cockroft, B &amp;amp; Olsson, KA 2000, ''Degradation of soil structure due to coalescence of aggregates in no-till, no-traffic beds in irrigated crops''.&lt;/ref&gt; The NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation suggests that in cropping systems, wheat yields can be increased by 10&amp;nbsp;kg/ha for every extra millimetre of rain that is able to infiltrate due to soil structure.&lt;ref name=NSW1991&gt;Department of Land and Water Conservation 1991, [http://www.naturalresources.nsw.gov.au/care/soil/soil_pubs/index.html "Field indicators of soil structure decline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914042431/http://www.naturalresources.nsw.gov.au/care/soil/soil_pubs/index.html |date=2007-09-14 }}, viewed May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardsetting soil==
Hardsetting soils lose their structure when wet and then set hard as they dry out to form a structureless mass that is very difficult to cultivate. They can only be tilled when their moisture content is within a limited range. When they are tilled the result is often a very cloddy surface (poor [[tilth]]). As they dry out the high soil strength often restricts seedling and root growth. Infiltration rates are low and runoff of rain and irrigation limits the productivity of many hardsetting soils.&lt;ref name="Daniells2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daniells |first1=Ian G. |title=Hardsetting soils: a review |journal=Soil Research |date=2012 |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=349–359 |doi=10.1071/SR11102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===

Hardsetting has been defined this way: "''A hardsetting soil is one that sets to an almost homogeneous mass on drying. It may have occasional cracks, typically at a spacing of &gt;0.1 m. Air dry hardset soil is hard and brittle, and it is not possible to push a forefinger into the profile face. Typically, it has a tensile strength of 90 kN&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt;. Soils that crust are not necessarily hardsetting since a hardsetting horizon is thicker than a crust. (In cultivated soils the thickness of the hardsetting horizon is frequently equal to or greater than that of the cultivated layer.) Hardsetting soil is not permanently cemented and is soft when wet. The clods in a hardsetting horizon that has been cultivated will partially or totally disintegrate upon wetting. If the soil has been sufficiently wetted, it will revert to its hardset state on drying. This can happen after flood irrigation or a single intense rainfall event.''"&lt;ref name="Mullins1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mullins |first1=CE |editor1=R Lal |editor2=WH Blum |editor3=C Valentin |editor4=BA Stewart |title=Methods for assessment of soil degradation |date=1997 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, FL |isbn=9780849374432 |chapter=Hardsetting |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gv5HEOrX8YC |accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soil Structure Dynamics ==
Soil structure is inherently a [[wikt:dynamic|dynamic]] and [[complex system]] that is affected by different factors such as [[tillage]], wheel traffic, [[root]]s, biological activities in soil, rainfall events, [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]], shrinking, swelling, freezing and thawing. In turn, reciprocally soil structure interacts and affects the root growth and function, [[Soil biology|soil fauna]] and biota, water and solute transport processes, [[gas exchange]], [[thermal conductivity]] and [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]], traffic [[bearing capacity]], and many other aspects in relation with soil. Ignoring soil structure or viewing it as “static” can lead to poor predictions of soil properties and might significantly affect the [[soil management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logsdon|first=Sally|last2=Berli|first2=Markus|last3=Horn|first3=Rainer|date=January 2013|title=Front Matter|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/books/abstracts/advancesinagric/quantifyingandm/frontmatter|journal=Quantifying and Modeling Soil Structure Dynamics|language=en|volume=advancesinagric|issue=quantifyingandm|pages=vii–ix|doi=10.2134/advagricsystmodel3.frontmatter|issn=2163-2790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These principles call for "enhanced diligence" in evaluating electric power industry borrowers in terms of their use of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]; [[Renewable energy|renewable]] and [[Low-carbon power|low-carbon]] distributed energy technologies; and conventional and advanced generating technologies. These guidelines were announced in February 2008 to address the increasing public concern over the plans to create over one hundred coal power plants in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/tobend/docs/the_principle_matter|title=The Principle Matter: Banks, Climate and The Carbon Principles.|last=|first=|date=January 19, 2011|website=issuu|access-date=November 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Climate Principles''' are of a similar framework for the climate change practice of the financial sector. This is a comprehensive industry framework for a response to climate change and has been adopted by Crédit Agricole, Munich Re, Standard Chartered, Swiss Re and HSBC.

A '''tire''' ([[American English]]) or '''tyre''' ([[British English]]; [[American and British English spelling differences#Miscellaneous spelling differences|see spelling differences]]) is a ring-shaped component that surrounds a [[Rim (wheel)|wheel's rim]] to transfer a vehicle's load from the axle through the wheel to the ground and to provide [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] on the surface traveled over. Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, are [[Inflatable|pneumatically]] inflated structures, which also provide a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface. Tires provide a footprint that is designed to match the weight of the vehicle with the bearing strength of the surface that it rolls over by providing a bearing pressure that will not deform the surface excessively.

The materials of modern pneumatic tires are [[synthetic rubber]], [[natural rubber]], fabric and wire, along with [[carbon black]] and other chemical compounds. They consist of a [[tread]] and a body. The tread provides [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] while the body provides containment for a quantity of [[compressed air]]. Before [[rubber]] was developed, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Early rubber tires were solid (not pneumatic). Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, including [[car]]s, [[bicycle]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[Heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]], and [[aircraft]]. Metal tires are still used on [[locomotive]]s and [[railcar]]s, and solid rubber (or other polymer) tires are still used in various non-automotive applications, such as some [[caster]]s, [[cart]]s, [[lawn mower|lawnmower]]s, and [[wheelbarrow]]s.

==Etymology and spelling==
The word ''tire'' is a short form of ''attire'', from the idea that a wheel with a tire is a dressed wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|tire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;

The spelling ''tyre'' does not appear until the 1840s when the English began shrink fitting railway car wheels with malleable iron. Nevertheless, traditional publishers continued using ''tire''. ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper in Britain was still using ''tire'' as late as 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cambridge Guide to English Usage | last=Peters | first=Pam | year=2004 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-0-521-62181-6 | page=553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling ''tyre'' began to be commonly used in the 19th century for pneumatic tires in the UK. The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] states that "[t]he spelling 'tyre' is not now accepted by the best English authorities, and is unrecognized in the US",&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica, vol. 26 |editor-first=Hugh |editor-last=Chisholm |year=1911 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |page=1007 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri26chisrich#page/1006/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|Fowler's ''Modern English Usage'']] of 1926 says that "there is nothing to be said for 'tyre', which is etymologically wrong, as well as needlessly divergent from our own [sc. British] older &amp; the present American usage".&lt;ref name="fowler"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage: The Classic First Edition |first=H.

==History==
{{see also|Railway tire}}
The earliest tires were bands of [[leather]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|last=Bertman |first=Stephen |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2 August 2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1C4NKp4zgIQC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=ancient+mesopotamian+leather+tires&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ss3dsfHfy5&amp;sig=a7KEOY4ZW64U7KcI1cFSfdMsruA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GizdU_u9A8WayASSp4KQDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20mesopotamian%20leather%20tires&amp;f=false p.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; then [[iron]] (later [[steel]]) placed on wooden [[wheel]]s used on [[cart]]s and [[wagon]]s. The tire would be heated in a [[forge]] fire, placed over the wheel and quenched, causing the metal to contract and fit tightly on the wheel. A skilled worker, known as a [[wheelwright]], carried out this work.

[[File:John Boyd Dunlop (c1915).jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Boyd Dunlop]] on a bicycle c. 1915]]
The first patent for what appears to be a standard pneumatic tire appeared in 1847&lt;ref&gt;( [http://v3.espacenet.com/origdoc?DB=EPODOC&amp;IDX=US5104&amp;F=0&amp;QPN=US5104 see US Patent 5104] )&lt;/ref&gt; lodged by the Scottish inventor [[Robert William Thomson]]. However, this never went into production. The first practical pneumatic tire was made in 1888&lt;ref group=note&gt;Dunlop believed he first thought of the pneumatic tire about October 1887&lt;/ref&gt; on May Street, [[Belfast]], by Scots-born [[John Boyd Dunlop]], owner of one of Ireland's most prosperous veterinary practices. It was an effort to prevent the headaches of his 10-year-old son Johnnie, while riding his [[tricycle]] on rough pavements. His doctor, John, later Sir John Fagan, had prescribed cycling as an exercise for the boy, and was a regular visitor. Fagan participated in designing the first pneumatic tires. Cyclist [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's tires in 1889, winning the tire's first-ever races in Ireland and then England.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling – William Hume, 1938. Archive maintained by 'The Pedal Club'.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403120845/http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html |date=3 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunlop time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunlop.eu/dunlop_uk/what_sets_dunlop_apart/history/|title=Technology &amp; Innovation|website=www.dunlop.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Dunlop's tire patent specification dated 31 October 1888, his interest is only in its use in cycles and light vehicles. In September 1890, he was made aware of an earlier development but the company kept the information to itself.&lt;ref name=ADC&gt;Sir Arthur Du Cros, Bt, ''Wheels of Fortune, a salute to pioneers'', Chapman &amp;  Hall, London 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, Dunlop's patent was declared invalid because of prior art by forgotten fellow Scot Robert William Thomson of London (patents London 1845, France 1846, USA 1847), although Dunlop is credited with "realizing rubber could withstand the wear and tear of being a tire while retaining its resilience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hutchinson Dictionary of Scientific Biography |last=Dunlop |first=John Boyd |year=2008 |publisher=AccessScience |accessdate=9 July 2009 |url=http://www.accessscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Boyd Dunlop and [[Harvey du Cros]] together worked through the ensuing considerable difficulties. They employed inventor Charles Kingston Welch and also acquired other rights and patents which allowed them some limited protection of their  [[Dunlop Rubber#Pneumatic Tyre|Pneumatic Tyre]] business's position. Pneumatic Tyre would become Dunlop Rubber and [[Dunlop Tyres]]. The development of this technology hinged on myriad engineering advances, including the [[sulfur vulcanization|vulcanization]] of natural rubber using sulfur, as well as by the development of the "clincher" rim for holding the tire in place laterally on the wheel rim.

[[Synthetic rubber]]s were invented in the laboratories of [[Bayer]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; In 1946, [[Michelin]] developed the [[radial tire]] method of construction. Michelin had bought the bankrupt [[Citroën]] automobile company in 1934, so it was able to fit this new technology immediately. Because of its superiority in handling and fuel economy,&lt;ref name="michelinag.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michelinag.com/Innovating/Radial-vs.-Bias-technology|title=Radial or bias, the right choice / Properly use your tires     - Michelin Agricultural Tires|last=Michelin|website=www.michelinag.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; use of this technology quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name="jags.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jags.org/TechInfo/2001/05May01/tires/historyoftires.htm|title=History|website=www.jags.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the outdated bias-ply tire construction persisted, with market share of 87% as late as 1967.&lt;ref name="jags.org"/&gt; Delay was caused by tire and automobile manufacturers in America "concerned about transition costs."&lt;ref name="jags.org"/&gt; In 1968, [[Consumer Reports]], an influential American magazine, acknowledged the superiority of radial construction, setting off a rapid decline in Michelin's competitor technology.&lt;ref name="A Tale of Two Tires"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-05-04/a-tale-of-two-tiresbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice | work=Bloomberg | title=A Tale of Two Tires}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the U.S., the radial tire now has a market share of 100% in automobiles.&lt;ref name="jags.org"/&gt;

Today, over 1 billion tires are produced annually in over 400 tire factories (see [[List of tire companies]]).

==Wheel support==
There are 2 aspects to how pneumatic tires support the rim of the wheel on which they are mounted.&lt;ref name = Clark1&gt;{{cite book
| title = Mechanics of Pneumatic Tires
| author = Samuel K. Clark, V. E. Gough
| publisher = U.S. Department of Transportation

| page = 245
| quote = Consider two mechanisms of force transmission acting in parallel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, tension in the [[Tire#Ply|cords]] pull on the [[Tire#Bead|bead]] uniformly around the wheel, except where it is reduced above the contact patch.&lt;ref name = Clark2&gt;{{cite book

| date = 1981
| page = 246
| quote = The only possible way in which the reaction can develop at the rim is by the changes in magnitude and direction of the membrane stresses at their points of attachment to the rim, in the region of the membrane near the point where the plate is pressed against it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the bead transfers that net force to the rim.&lt;ref name = Clark3&gt;{{cite book
| title = Mechanics of Pneumatic Tires
| author = Samuel K. Clark, V. E. Gough
| publisher = U.S. Department of Transportation
| date = 1981
| page = 246
| quote = This force pulls the bead coil against the base of the wheel rim above the contact area, thus transmitting the upward force to the wheel.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air pressure, via the ply cords, exerts [[Tension (physics)|tensile force]] on the entire bead surrounding the wheel rim on which the tire is mounted, pulling outward in a 360 degree pattern. Thus the bead must have high tensile strength. With no force applied to the outer tread, the bead is pulled equally in all directions, thus no additional net force is applied to the tire bead and wheel rim. However, when the tread is pushed inward on one side, this releases some tension in the corresponding sidewall ply pulling on the bead. Yet the sidewall ply on the other side continues to pull the bead in the opposite direction. Thus the still fully tensioned sidewall ply pulls the tire bead and wheel rim in the same direction as the tread displacement with equal force as that applied to push the tread inward.&lt;ref name = Clark2/&gt;

This sidewall ply to bead tension support was a big reason for older cross-ply cord tire construction using the materials available in the early 19th century. The cross-ply cord arrangement orients the cords to more directly support the bead &amp; wheel rim (like a sling: bead to cord and around below the tread back to the opposite bead, both ways, thus crossing plies of cords). 
However, with improved combinations of cord, bead, rim materials, and manufacturing techniques, combined with ongoing focus and research on tire efficiency and durability, it became both feasible and desirable to manufacture radial-ply cord tires, which, for many applications (despite higher costs), outperform and more than outlast (reliable-usual-service-life/cost ratio) similar cross-ply cord tire designs by (a) facilitating a flatter contact pattern with more evenly distributed pressure on the momentarily stationary area of contact between tread &amp; ground and (b) lower operating costs over time: due to reduced tire temperature, decreased rolling resistance, lower puncture rates, greater longevity, etc.&lt;ref name="michelinag.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocomponents.com/dealer/powersports-industry/bias-ply-radial-explained/|title=Powersports - ATV and UTV tire applications for off-road fit|website=cocomponents.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forconstructionpros.com/article/10307455/pros-and-cons-of-radial-vs-bias-ply|title=Pros and Cons of Radial vs. Bias-Ply Tires in Construction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carsdirect.com/car-repair/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-radial-tires|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Radial Tires|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
{{Main article|Tire manufacturing}}
Pneumatic tires are manufactured in about 450 tire factories around the world. Tire production starts with bulk raw materials such as rubber (60% -70% synthetic&lt;ref name="Michelin The tire digest"&gt;{{cite web | title=An unknow object: the tire - Materials | website=Michelin The tire digest | url=http://thetiredigest.michelin.com/an-unknown-object-the-tire-materials | access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kal Tire 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=What’s the Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Rubber for Tires? | website=Kal Tire | date=2017-07-21 | url=https://www.kaltire.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-synthetic-rubber-for-tires/ | access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), carbon black, and chemicals and produces numerous specialized components that are assembled and cured. Many kinds of rubber are used, the most common being [[styrene-butadiene]] [[copolymer]]. The article [[Tire manufacturing]] describes the components assembled to make a tire, the various materials used, the manufacturing processes and machinery, and the overall business model.

[[File:ESBR.png|thumb|[[Styrene-butadiene]] copolymer (chemical structure pictured) is the most popular material used in the production of rubber tires.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Werner Obrecht, Jean-Pierre Lambert, Michael Happ, Christiane Oppenheimer-Stix, John Dunn and Ralf Krüger "Rubber, 4.

In 2004, $80 billion of tires were sold worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-295707/Global-tire-industry-hits-80.html|title=Find Local Contractors - Home Remodeling Contractors on Ecnext|website=goliath.ecnext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010 it was $140 billion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubbermarketnews.net/2010/07/global-tyre-sale-to-improve-in-2010.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511002205/http://www.rubbermarketnews.net/2010/07/global-tyre-sale-to-improve-in-2010.html|date=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (approximately 34% growth adjusting for inflation), and is expected to grow to $258 billion per year by 2019.&lt;ref name=freedonia2019 /&gt;  In 2015, the US manufactured almost 170 million tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Bruce|title=2015 was strong year for U.S. tire industry|url=http://www.tirebusiness.com/article/20160217/NEWS/160219928|website=Tire Business|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2.5 billion tires are manufactured annually, making the tire [[industry]] a major consumer of natural rubber.

As of 2011, the top three tire manufacturing companies by revenue were [[Bridgestone]] (manufacturing 190 million tires), [[Michelin]] (184 million), [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] (181 million); they were followed by [[Continental AG|Continental]], and [[Pirelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.companiesandmarkets.com/Market-Report/research-report-on-worlds-top-50-tire-enterprises,-2010-2011-454329.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120010101/http://www.companiesandmarkets.com/Market%2DReport/research%2Dreport%2Don%2Dworlds%2Dtop%2D50%2Dtire%2Denterprises%2C%2D2010%2D2011%2D454329.asp|archivedate= January 20, 2011 |title= Research Report on World's Top 50 Tire Enterprises, 2010-2011 Market Research Report |date=December 2, 2010 |website= Companiesandmarkets.com |dead-url= yes |publisher=Vertical Edge Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Statista&gt;{{Citation |url= https://www.statista.com/statistics/225677/revenue-of-the-leading-tire-producers-worldwide/ |title=The world's largest tire manufacturers in Q1 and Q2 2016, based on tire-related sales (in billion U.S. dollars) |website= [[Statista]] |year= 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lego]] group produced over 318 million [[Lego tire|toy tires]] in 2011 and was recognized by [[Guinness World Records]] as having the highest annual production of tires by any manufacturer.&lt;ref name="rubber world"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Shift of emphasis|journal=Rubber World|date=1 April 2012|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Shift+of+emphasis.-a0289215925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Materials==
The materials of modern pneumatic tires can be divided into two groups, the cords that make up the ply and the [[elastomer]] which encases them.

===Cords===
The cords, which form the [[Tire#Ply|ply]] and [[Tire#Bead|bead]] and provide the tensile strength necessary to contain the inflation pressure, can be composed of [[steel]], natural fibers such as [[cotton]] or [[silk]], or synthetic fibers such as [[nylon]] or [[kevlar]].

===Elastomer===
The elastomer, which forms the [[Tire#Tread|tread]] and encases the cords to protect them from abrasion and hold them in place, is a key component of pneumatic tire design. It can be composed of various composites of rubber material&amp;nbsp;– the most common being [[styrene-butadiene]] copolymer&amp;nbsp;– with other chemical compound such as [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] and [[carbon black]].

==== Rolling resistance ====
Optimizing [[rolling resistance]] in the elastomer material is a key challenge for reducing fuel consumption in the transportation sector. It is estimated that passenger vehicles consume approximately 5~15% of its fuel to overcome rolling resistance, while the estimate is understood to be higher for heavy trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alternative Fuels Data Center: Low Rolling Resistance Tires|url = http://www.afdc.energy.gov/conserve/fuel_economy_tires_light.html|website = www.afdc.energy.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a trade-off between rolling resistance and wet traction and grip: while low rolling resistance can be achieved by reducing the viscoelastic properties of the rubber compound (low [[Dissipation factor|tangent (δ)]]), it comes at the cost of wet traction and grip, which requires hysteresis and energy dissipation (high tangent (δ)). A low tangent (δ) value at 60&amp;nbsp;°C is used as an indicator of low rolling resistance, while a high tangent (δ) value at 0&amp;nbsp;°C is used as an indicator of high wet traction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Dynamic Mechanical Properties Of Passenger And Light Truck Tire Treads". Report No. '''DOT''' '''HS''' '''811 270.''' National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation. '''2010.'''&lt;/ref&gt; Designing an elastomer material that can achieve both high wet traction and low rolling resistance is key in achieving safety and fuel efficiency in the transportation sector.

The most common elastomer material used today is a styrene-butadiene copolymer. It combines [[1,3-Butadiene|butadiene]], which is a highly rubbery polymer (''[[Glass transition|Tg]]'' = -100&amp;nbsp;°C) that has high hysteresis and thus offers good wet grip properties, with styrene, which is a highly glass polymer (''Tg'' = 100&amp;nbsp;°C) that has low [[hysteresis]] and thus offers low rolling resistance in addition to [[wear]] resistance.

==Components==
[[File:Bridgestone tire cross section.png|thumb|Tire [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|cross section]] showing components]]

A tire carcass is composed of several parts: the tread, bead, sidewall, shoulder, and ply.

===Tread===
{{Main article|Tread}}
[[File:Mountain bike tires.JPG|thumb|Two mountain bicycle tires with different tread patterns]]
The tread is the part of the tire that comes in contact with the road surface. The portion that is in contact with the road at a given instant in time is the [[contact patch]]. The tread is a thick rubber, or rubber/composite compound formulated to provide an appropriate level of traction that does not wear away too quickly. The tread pattern is characterized by the geometrical shape of the grooves, lugs, [[wikt:void|voids]] and [[Siping (rubber)|sipes]]. Grooves run circumferentially around the tire, and are needed to channel away water. Lugs are that portion of the tread design that contacts the road surface. Voids are spaces between lugs that allow the lugs to flex and evacuate water. Tread patterns feature non-symmetrical (or non-uniform) lug sizes circumferentially to minimize noise levels at discrete frequencies. Sipes are slits cut across the tire, usually perpendicular to the grooves, which allow the water from the grooves to escape to the sides in an effort to prevent [[Hydroplaning (tires)|hydroplaning]].

Treads are often designed to meet specific product marketing positions. High-performance tires have small [[void ratio]]s to provide more rubber in contact with the road for higher traction, but may be compounded with softer rubber that provides better traction, but wears quickly. Mud and snow (M&amp;S) tires are designed with higher void ratios to channel away rain and mud, while providing better gripping performance.

====Tread lug====
Tread lugs provide the contact surface necessary to provide traction. As the tread lug enters the road contact area, or footprint, it is compressed. As it rotates through the footprint it is deformed circumferentially. As it exits the footprint, it recovers to its original shape. During the deformation and recovery cycle the tire exerts variable forces into the vehicle.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} These forces are described as [[Radial force variation|Force Variation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Study on Uniformity Force Variations in PCR &amp; UVR 16" &amp; 17" Tyre Sizes|url = http://www.slideshare.net/smsajl/project-presentation-study-on-uniformity-force-variations-in-pcr-uvr-sizes|date = 2014-06-05|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102005155/http://www.slideshare.net/smsajl/project-presentation-study-on-uniformity-force-variations-in-pcr-uvr-sizes|archivedate = 2016-01-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

====Tread void====
Tread voids provide space for the lug to flex and deform as it enters and exits the footprint. Voids also provide channels for rainwater, mud, and snow to be channeled away from the footprint. The void ratio is the void area of the tire divided by the entire tread area. Low void areas have high contact area and therefore higher traction on clean, dry pavement.

====Rain groove====
The rain groove is a design element of the tread pattern specifically arranged to channel water away from the footprint. Rain grooves are circumferential in most [[truck]] tires. Many high-performance passenger tires feature rain grooves that are angled from the center toward the sides of the tire. Some tire manufacturers claim that their tread pattern is designed to actively pump water out from under the tire by the action of the tread flexing. This results in a smoother ride in different types of weather.&lt;ref name="Rain Groove Tires"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rain Groove|url=https://www.rightturn.com/tire-guide/rain-groove/|website=RightTurn|publisher=Dealer Tires|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sipes====
Tread lugs often feature slits—''sipes''—that improve the flexibility of the lug to deform as it traverses the footprint area. This reduces [[shear stress]] in the lug and reduces heat build up. Testing of identical siped and unsiped tires showed measurable improvements in snow traction and ice braking performance, however diminishing and extending braking distances on wet and dry pavement by a few feet on siped tires. Off-road tire enthusiasts have been siping tires for years for greater traction, as many manufacturers now offer already siped off-road-tires.

====Wear bar====
Wear bars (or wear indicators) are raised features located at the bottom of the tread grooves that indicate the tire has reached its wear limit. When the tread lugs are worn to the point that the wear bars connect across the lugs, the tires are fully worn and should be taken out of service. Most wear bars indicate a remaining tread depth of {{convert|1.6|mm|in}} and are tires are deemed "worn out" when the tread is worn down to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwik-fit.com/changing-tyres.asp |title=How can I tell when my tyres need changing? |author=KwikFit |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bead===
The [[tire bead]] is the part of the tire that contacts the [[rim (wheel)|rim]] on the wheel. The bead is typically reinforced with steel wire and compounded of high strength, low flexibility rubber. The bead seats tightly against the two rims on the wheel to ensure that a tubeless tire holds air without leakage. The bead fit is tight to ensure the tire does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to the tire is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports the tire's profile.

===Sidewall===
[[File:Tire Severe Under Inflation Wear.jpg|thumb|Uneven sidewall wear, down to fabric plies, due to significant under-inflation]]
The sidewall is that part of the tire that bridges between the tread and bead. The sidewall is largely rubber but reinforced with fabric or steel cords that provide for tensile strength and flexibility. The sidewall contains air pressure and transmits the torque applied by the drive axle to the tread to create traction but supports little of the weight of the vehicle, as is clear from the total collapse of the tire when punctured. Sidewalls are molded with manufacturer-specific detail, government mandated warning labels, and other consumer information, and sometimes decorative ornamentation, like [[whitewall tire|whitewalls]] or [[tire lettering]].

===Shoulder===
The shoulder is that part of the tire at the edge of the tread as it makes transition to the sidewall.

===Ply===
[[Ply (layer)|Plies]] are layers of relatively inextensible cords embedded in the rubber&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pvsv78xj7UIC&amp;dq=Tire+dynamics&amp;q=ply#v=snippet&amp;q=ply&amp;f=false |title=Vehicle dynamics: theory and applications |first=Reza N. |last=Jazar |publisher=Springer |quote=Inner layers are made of different fabrics, called plies. |year=2008 |page=11 |isbn=978-0-387-74243-4 |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hold its shape by preventing the rubber from stretching in response to the internal pressure. The orientations of the plies play a large role in the performance of the tire and is one of the main ways that tires are categorized.

=={{Visible anchor|Associated components}}==
Several additional components may be required in addition to just the tire to form a functional wheel.

===Wheel===
{{Main article|Wheel}}
Tires are mounted onto [[wheel]]s that most often have integral rims on their outer edges to hold the tire. Automotive wheels are typically made from pressed and welded steel, or a composite of lightweight metal [[alloy]]s, such as aluminum or magnesium. These [[alloy wheel]]s may be either [[casting|cast]] or [[forging|forged]]. The mounted tire and wheel assembly is then bolted to the vehicle's [[Wheel hub assembly|hub]]. A decorative [[hubcap]] and trim ring may be placed over the wheel.

===Rim===
{{Main article|Rim (wheel)}}
The beads of the tire are held on the [[Rim (wheel)|rim]], or the "outer edge" of a wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUE0bazkcxAC&amp;pg=PA722&amp;lpg=PA722&amp;dq=rim+3+outer+edge+of+a+wheel,+holding+the+tire+722 |title=The Pocket Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus |editor-first=Elizabeth |editor-last=Jewel |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-530715-3 |page=722 |accessdate=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These outer edges are shaped to obtain a proper shape on each side, having a radially cylindrical inclined inner wall on which the tire can be mounted. The wheel's rim must be of the proper design and type to hold the bead of the appropriately sized tire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/Publications/wheel/wheel-chart-booklet.pdf |title=Demounting and Mounting Procedures |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tires are mounted on the wheel by forcing its beads into the channel formed by the wheel's inner and outer rims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_LZMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA579&amp;dq=define:+wheel+rim |title=American Machinist, Volume 40 |pages=597–598 |date=1914-04-02 |accessdate=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inner tube===
[[File:Fietband lek zoeken.jpg|thumb|A bicycle inner tube being tested for an air leak]]
Most [[bicycle tire]]s, many [[motorcycle tire]]s, and many tires for large vehicles such as buses, heavy trucks, and tractors are designed for use with '''inner tubes'''. Inner tubes are [[torus]]-shaped balloons made from an impermeable material, such as soft, elastic synthetic rubber, to prevent air leakage. The inner tubes are inserted into the tire and inflated to retain air pressure.

Large inner tubes can be re-used for other purposes, such as swimming and rafting (see [[swim ring]]), [[tubing (recreation)]], [[sledding]], and [[skitching]]. Purpose-built inflatable tori are also manufactured for these uses, offering choice of colors, fabric covering, handles, decks, and other accessories, and eliminating the protruding valve stem.

===Valve stem===
[[File:Tire valve stem-cap off.jpg|thumb|Schrader valve stem with its cap removed]]
{{Main article|Valve stem}}
The valve stem is a tube made of metal or rubber, through which the tire is inflated, with a [[check valve]], typically a [[Schrader valve]] on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a [[Presta valve]] on high-performance bicycles. Valve stems usually protrude through the wheel for easy access. They mount directly to the rim, in the case of tubeless tires, or are an integral part of the inner tube. The rubber in valve stems eventually degrades, and, in the case of tubeless tires, replacement of the valve stem at regular intervals or with tire replacement reduces the chance of failure. Some may notice that their valve stem is all metal with a nut retaining it (as opposed to the typical rubber stem with brass threads). Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a [[Tire-pressure monitoring system|tire pressure monitoring system]] which usually consists of a valve stem attached to an electronic module. The module is hidden inside and is only visible when the tire has been removed from the wheel.

==Construction types==
[[Radial tire]] technology is now the standard design for essentially all automotive tires, but other methods have been used.&lt;ref name="jags.org"/&gt;

[[File:Tire plies.png|thumb|A cross-section of a tire showing ply orientations]]

===Bias===
''Bias tire'' (or cross ply) construction utilizes body ply cords that extend diagonally from bead to bead, usually at angles in the range of 30 to 40 degrees, with successive plies laid at opposing angles forming a crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied. The design allows the entire tire body to flex easily, providing the main advantage of this construction, a smooth ride on rough surfaces. This cushioning characteristic also causes the major disadvantages of a bias tire: increased [[rolling resistance]] and less control and [[traction (engineering)|traction]] at higher speeds.&lt;ref name="michelinag.com"/&gt; This outdated technology is still made in limited quantities to supply collector vehicles.&lt;ref name="jags.org"/&gt; It is possible to fit older cars with modern tires if historical authenticity is not paramount.&lt;ref name="A Tale of Two Tires"/&gt;

===Belted bias===
A '''belted bias tire''' starts with two or more bias-plies to which stabilizer belts are bonded directly beneath the tread. This construction provides smoother ride that is similar to the bias tire, while lessening rolling resistance because the belts increase tread stiffness. The design was introduced by Armstrong, while Goodyear made it popular with the "[[Goodyear Polyglas tire|Polyglas]]" trademark tire featuring a polyester carcass with belts of fiberglass.&lt;ref name="pliesandangles"&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LtUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Plies+and+angles+-+see+how+they+run+Until+1967+U.S.+tiremakers |page=62 |title=Plies and angles - see how they run |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=March 1972 |volume=136 |issue=3 |accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "belted" tire starts two main plies of polyester, rayon, or nylon annealed as in conventional tires, and then placed on top are circumferential belts at different angles that improve performance compared to non-belted bias tires. The belts may be fiberglass or steel.&lt;ref name="pliesandangles"/&gt; 
This technology was a temporary, ''[[not invented here]]'' stop-gap, introduced by U.S. manufacturers to forestall the radial tire.&lt;ref name="jags.org"/&gt;

===Radial===
{{Main article|Radial tire}}
Radial tire construction utilizes body ply cords extending from the beads and across the tread so that the cords are laid at approximately right angles to the centerline of the tread, and parallel to each other, as well as stabilizer belts directly beneath the tread. The belts may be cord or steel. The advantages of this construction include longer tread life, better steering control, fewer blowouts, improved fuel economy, and lower rolling resistance. Disadvantages of the radial tire are a harder ride at low speeds on rough roads and in the context of off-roading, decreased "self-cleaning" ability and lower grip ability at low speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mud-throwers.com/bias_vs_radial_tires |title=Bias vs Radial Tires |publisher=Mud-throwers.com |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1968 ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' announcement of the superiority of the radial design, radials began an inexorable climb in market share, reaching 100% of the North America market in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="A Tale of Two Tires"/&gt;

===Tubeless===
{{Main|Tubeless tire}}
Tubeless tires are [[Pneumatics |pneumatic]] tires that do not require a separate [[Tire#Associated_components|inner tube]].

===Semi-pneumatic===
Semi-pneumatic tires have a hollow center, but they are not pressurized. They are light-weight, low-cost, puncture proof, and provide cushioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Thomas H. |journal=Popular Science | title=Get things moving with casters, glides, and wheels | volume=216 |issue=5 |page=148 |year=1980 |issn=0161-7370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tires often come as a complete assembly with the wheel and even integral [[ball bearing]]s. They are used on [[lawn mower]]s, [[wheelchair]]s, and [[wheelbarrow]]s. They can also be rugged, typically used in industrial applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomasnet.com/products/semipneumatic-wheels-93980407-1.html |title=Thomas Net sources for industrial use 'Semi-Pneumatic Wheels' |publisher=Thomasnet.com |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are designed to not pull off their [[Rim (wheel)|rim]] under use.

Tires that are hollow but are not pressurized have also been designed for automotive use, such as the [[Tweel]] (a portmanteau of tire and wheel), which is an experimental tire design being developed at Michelin. The outer casing is rubber as in ordinary radial tires, but the interior has special compressible [[polyurethane]] springs to contribute to a comfortable ride. Besides the impossibility of going flat, the tires are intended to combine the comfort offered by higher-profile tires (with tall sidewalls) with the resistance to cornering forces offered by low profile tires. They have not yet been delivered for broad market use.

===Airless===
[[File:2005 091112-28rim0051 compressed.JPG|thumb|[[Airless tire]]]]
{{main article|Airless tire}}

===Solid===
Many tires used in industrial and commercial applications are non-pneumatic, and are manufactured from solid rubber and plastic compounds via molding operations. '''Solid tires''' include those used for lawn mowers, skateboards, golf carts, scooters, and many types of light industrial vehicles, carts, and trailers. One of the most common applications for solid tires is for material handling equipment (forklifts). Such tires are installed by means of a hydraulic tire press.

===Metal===

==Specifications==

===Tire pressure monitoring system===
{{Main article|Tire-pressure monitoring system}}
Tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS) are electronic systems that monitor the tire pressures on individual wheels on a vehicle, and alert the driver when the pressure goes below a warning limit. There are several types of designs to monitor tire pressure. Some actually measure the air pressure, and some make indirect measurements, such as gauging when the relative size of the tire changes due to lower air pressure.

===Inflation pressure===
Tires are specified by the vehicle manufacturer with a recommended inflation pressure, which permits safe operation within the specified load rating and vehicle loading. Most tires are stamped with a maximum pressure rating. For passenger vehicles and light trucks, the tires should be inflated to what the vehicle manufacturer recommends, which is usually located on a decal just inside the driver's door or in the vehicle owners handbook. Tires should not generally be inflated to the pressure on the sidewall; this is the maximum pressure, rather than the recommended pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cars.cartalk.com/content/advice/tirepressure.html | title=Car Talk Service Advice: Tire Pressure | accessdate=2009-01-16 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203160511/http://cars.cartalk.com/content/advice/tirepressure.html | archivedate=2011-12-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inflated tires naturally lose pressure over time. Not all tire-to-rim seals, valve-stem-to-rim seals, and valve seals themselves are perfect. Furthermore, tires are not completely impermeable to air, and so lose pressure over time naturally due to diffusion of molecules ''through'' the rubber. Some drivers and stores inflate tires with [[nitrogen]] (typically at 95% purity), instead of atmospheric [[Air#Composition|air]], which is already 78% nitrogen, in an attempt to keep the tires at the proper inflation pressure longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23836583-taking-a-ride-on-boriss-hot-wheels-hire-bikes.do |title=Taking a ride on Boris's hot wheels hire bikes |first=Ross |last=Lydall |date=2010-05-21 |publisher=London Evening Standard |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the use of nitrogen vs. air as a means to reduce the rate of pressure loss is baseless, and has been shown to be a bogus marketing gimmick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nitrogen-filled-tires-fuel-efficiency |title=Do Nitrogen-Filled Tires Enhance Fuel-Efficiency? |date=September 30, 2008 |publisher=Scientific American |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/columns/Archive/2005/February/02.html |title=Dear Tom and Ray |date=February 2005 |author=Tom and Ray Magliozzi | publisher=CarTalk.com |accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study noted a {{convert|1.3|psi|kPa bar|abbr=on}} difference (from an initial pressure of {{convert|30|psi|kPa bar|abbr=on}}) for air-filled vs. nitrogen-filled tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2007/10/tires-nitrogen-.html |title=Tires - Nitrogen air loss study |first=Gene |last=Petersen |publisher=Consumer Reports |date=October 4, 2007 |quote=Bottom line: Overall, consumers can use nitrogen and might enjoy the slight improvement in air retention provided, but it's not a substitute for regular inflation checks. | accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test showed an average loss of {{convert|2.2|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} for the nitrogen filled tires compared to {{convert|3.5|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} for the air filled tires. However, the statistical significance of the test was not given as no ''t''-test nor ''p'' values were reported. And they do note that the loss in both the nitrogen filled tires and the air filled tires mean that tire pressures should be checked regularly.

The tire contact patch is readily changed by both over- and underinflation. Overinflation may increase the wear on the center contact patch, and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall contact patch will still be larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.barrystiretech.com/airortire.html | title=Air or Tire | accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated. An increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/Cars/rules/rulings/TirePresFinal/FEA/TPMS3.html | title=FEA Chapter III: Tire pressure survey and test results | accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; If tire pressure is too low, the tire contact patch is greatly increased. This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature tread wear, and tread separation in severe cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/Cars/rules/rulings/TirePresFinal/FEA/TPMS3.html | title=NHTSA test | accessdate=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Load rating===
Tires are specified by the manufacturer with a maximum load rating. Loads exceeding the rating can result in unsafe conditions that can lead to steering instability and even rupture. For a table of load ratings, see [[tire code]].

===Speed rating===
The speed rating denotes the maximum speed at which a tire is designed to be operated. For passenger vehicles these ratings range from {{convert|160|to|300|km/h|mph|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. For a table of speed ratings, see [[tire code]].

===Service rating===
Tires (especially in the U.S.) are often given service ratings, mainly used on bus and truck tires. Some ratings are for long haul, and some for stop-start multi-drop type work. Tires designed to run {{convert|500|mi}} or more per day carrying heavy loads require special specifications.

===Treadwear rating===
{{Main article|Treadwear rating}}
The treadwear rating or treadwear grade is how long the tire manufacturers expect the tire to last. A Course Monitoring Tire (the standard tire that a test tire will be compared to) has a rating of "100". If a manufacturer assigns a treadwear rating of 200 to a new tire, they are indicating that they expect the new tire to have a useful lifespan that is 200% of the life of a Course Monitoring Tire. The "test tires" are all manufacturer-dependent. Brand A's rating of 500 is not necessarily going to offer drivers the same mileage rating as Brand B's tire of the same rating. The testing is non-regulated and can vary greatly. Treadwear ratings are only useful for comparing Brand A's entire lineup against itself.
Tread wear, also known as tire wear, is caused by friction between the tire and the road surface. Government legal standards prescribe the minimum allowable tread depth for safe operation.

===Rotation===
Tires may exhibit irregular wear patterns once installed on a vehicle and partially worn. [[Front-wheel drive]] vehicles tend to wear the front tires at a greater rate compared to the rear tires. Tire rotation is moving the tires to different car positions, such as front-to-rear, in order to even out the wear, with the objective of extending the life of the tire.&lt;ref name = Gilles/&gt;

===Wheel alignment===
{{Main article|Wheel alignment}}
When mounted on the vehicle, the wheel and tire may not be perfectly aligned to the direction of travel, and therefore may exhibit irregular wear. If the discrepancy in alignment is large, then the irregular wear will become substantial if left uncorrected.

Wheel alignment is the procedure for checking and correcting this condition through adjustment of [[Camber angle|camber]], [[Caster angle|caster]] and [[Toe (automotive)|toe]] angles. The adjustment of the angles should be done as per the OEM specifications.

===Retread===
{{Main article|Retread}}
Tires that are fully worn can be re-manufactured to replace the worn tread. This is known as retreading or recapping, a process of buffing away the worn tread and applying a new tread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.besttiresguide.com/retread-tires |title=What are Retread Tires? |publisher=Best Tires Guide |accessdate=2014-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717064038/http://www.besttiresguide.com/retread-tires/ |archivedate=2014-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Retreading is economical for truck tires because the cost of replacing the tread is less than the price of a new tire. Retreading passenger tires is less economical because the cost of retreading is high compared to the price of new cheap tires, but favorable compared to high-end brands.

Worn tires can be retreaded by two methods, the mold or hot cure method and the pre-cure or cold one. The mold cure method involves the application of raw rubber on the previously buffed and prepared casing, which is later cured in matrices. During the curing period, vulcanization takes place and the raw rubber bonds to the casing, taking the tread shape of the matrix. On the other hand, the pre-cure method involves the application of a ready-made tread band on the buffed and prepared casing, which later is cured in an autoclave so that vulcanization can occur.

During the retreading process, retread technicians must ensure the casing is in the best condition possible to minimize the possibility of a casing failure. Casings with problems such as capped tread, tread separation, irreparable cuts, corroded belts or sidewall damage, or any run-flat or skidded tires, will be rejected.

In most situations, retread tires can be driven under the same conditions and at the same speeds as new tires with no loss in safety or comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/tools/cpg/products/retread.htm |title=Retread Tires |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of retread failures should be about the same as for new tire failures, but many drivers, including truckers, are guilty of not maintaining proper air pressure on a regular basis, and, if a tire is abused (overloaded, underinflated, or mismatched to the other tire on a set of duals), then that tire (new or recapped) will fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retread.org/Government/index.cfm/ID/13.htm |last=Brodsky |first=Harvey |title=Federal Government Endorses the Use of Retreaded Tires |publisher=Tire Retread Information Bureau |accessdate=2010-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525023938/http://www.retread.org/Government/index.cfm/ID/13.htm |archivedate=May 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commercial trucking companies put retreads only on trailers, using only new tires on their steering and drive wheels. This procedure increases the driver's chance of maintaining control in case of problems with a retreaded tire.

==Performance characteristics==
The interaction of a tire with the pavement is a very complex [[phenomenon]]. Many of the details are modeled in [[Pacejka#The Pacejka "Magic Formula" tire models|Pacejka's Magic Formula]]. Some are explained below.

===Balance===
{{main article|Tire balance}}

When a wheel and tire rotate, they exert a [[centrifugal force]] on the axle that depends on the location of their [[center of mass]] and the orientation of their [[moment of inertia]]. This is referred to as balance, imbalance, or unbalance. Tires are checked at the point of manufacture for excessive static imbalance and dynamic imbalance using automatic tire balance machines. Tires are checked again in the auto assembly plant or tire retail shop after mounting the tire to the wheel. Assemblies that exhibit excessive imbalance are corrected by applying balance weights to the wheels to counteract the tire/wheel imbalance. An alternative method to tire balancing is the use of internal tire balancing agents. These agents take advantage of centrifugal force and inertia to counteract the tire imbalance.{{fact|date = July 2018}}

To facilitate proper balancing, most high-performance tire manufacturers place red and yellow marks on the sidewalls to enable the best possible match-mounting of the tire/wheel assembly. There are two methods of match-mounting high-performance tire to wheel assemblies using these red (uniformity) or yellow (weight) marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yokohamatire.com/utmatch.asp|title=Tire Match Mounting and Balancing - Yokohama Tire|first=INK|last=Agency|website=www.yokohamatire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camber thrust===
{{Main article|Camber thrust}}
Camber thrust and camber force are the force generated perpendicular to the direction of travel of a rolling tire due to its [[camber angle]] and finite contact patch.

===Centrifugal growth===
A tire rotating at higher speeds tends to develop a larger diameter, due to [[centrifugal force]]s that force the tread rubber away from the axis of rotation. This may cause [[Speedometer Error|speedometer error]]. As the tire [[diameter]] grows, the tire width decreases. This centrifugal growth can cause rubbing of the tire against the vehicle at high speeds. [[Motorcycle]] tires are often designed with reinforcements aimed at minimizing centrifugal growth.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Circle of forces===
{{Main article|Circle of forces}}
The circle of forces, traction circle, friction circle, or friction ellipse is a useful way to think about the dynamic interaction between a vehicle's tire and the road surface.

===Contact patch===
{{Main article|contact patch}}
The contact patch, or footprint, of the tire, is the area of the tread that is in contact with the road surface. This area transmits forces between the tire and the road via friction. The length-to-width ratio of the contact patch affects steering and cornering behavior.

===Cornering force===
{{Main article|Cornering force}}
Cornering force or side force is the lateral (i.e. parallel to the road surface) force produced by a vehicle tire during cornering.

===Dry traction===
Dry traction is measure of the tire's ability to deliver traction, or grip, under dry conditions. Dry traction is a function of the tackiness of the rubber compound.

===Force variation===
The tire tread and sidewall elements undergo deformation and recovery as they enter and exit the footprint. Since the rubber is elastomeric, it is deformed during this cycle. As the rubber deforms and recovers, it imparts cyclical forces into the vehicle. These variations are collectively referred to as [[tire uniformity]]. Tire uniformity is characterized by [[Radial Force Variation|radial force variation]] (RFV), [[lateral force variation]] (LFV) and [[Tire uniformity#Tangential force variation|tangential force variation]]. Radial and lateral force variation is measured on a [[force variation machine]] at the end of the manufacturing process. Tires outside the specified limits for RFV and LFV are rejected. Geometric parameters, including radial runout, lateral runout, and sidewall bulge, are measured using a tire uniformity machine at the tire factory at the end of the manufacturing process as a quality check. In the late 1990s, [[Hunter Engineering]] introduced the GSP9700 Road Force balancer, which is equipped with a load roller similar to the force variation machine used at the factory to grade tire uniformity. This machine can find the best position for the tire on a given wheel so that the over-all assembly is as round as possible.

===Load sensitivity===
{{Main article|Tire load sensitivity}}
Load sensitivity is the behaviour of tires under load. Conventional pneumatic tires do not behave as [[Friction#Laws of dry friction|classical friction]] theory would suggest. Namely, the load sensitivity of most real tires in their typical operating range is such that the coefficient of friction decreases as the vertical load, Fz, increases.

===Pneumatic trail===
{{Main article|Pneumatic trail}}
[[Pneumatic trail]] of a tire is the trail-like effect generated by compliant tires rolling on a hard surface and subject to side loads, as in a turn. More technically, it is the distance that the resultant [[Cornering force|force]] of [[Slip angle|side-slip]] occurs behind the geometric center of the [[contact patch]].

===Relaxation length===
{{Main article|Relaxation length}}
Relaxation length is the delay between when a slip angle is introduced and when the cornering force reaches its steady-state value.

===Rolling resistance===
{{Main article|Rolling resistance}}
Rolling resistance is the resistance to rolling caused by deformation of the tire in contact with the road surface. As the tire rolls, tread enters the contact area and is deformed flat to conform to the roadway. The energy required to make the deformation depends on the inflation pressure, rotating speed, and numerous physical properties of the tire structure, such as spring force and stiffness. Tire makers seek lower rolling resistance tire constructions to improve [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] in cars and especially trucks, where rolling resistance accounts for a high proportion of fuel consumption.

Pneumatic tires also have a much lower rolling resistance than solid tires. Because the internal air pressure acts in all directions, a pneumatic tire is able to "absorb" bumps in the road as it rolls over them without experiencing a reaction force opposite to the direction of travel, as is the case with a solid (or foam-filled) tire. The difference between the rolling resistance of a pneumatic and solid tire is easily felt when propelling [[wheelchair]]s or baby buggies fitted with either type so long as the terrain has a significant roughness in relation to the wheel diameter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Self aligning torque===
{{Main article|Self aligning torque}}
Self-aligning torque, also known as the aligning torque, SAT or Mz, is the [[torque]] that a tire creates as it rolls along that tends to steer it, i.e. rotate it around its vertical axis.

===Slip angle===
{{Main article|Slip angle}}
Slip angle or sideslip angle is the angle between a rolling wheel's actual direction of travel and the direction towards which it is pointing (i.e., the angle of the vector sum of wheel translational velocity &lt;math&gt;v_x&lt;/math&gt; and sideslip velocity &lt;math&gt;v_y&lt;/math&gt;).

===Spring rate===
Vertical stiffness, or [[spring rate]], is the ratio of vertical force to vertical deflection of the tire, and it contributes to the overall suspension performance of the vehicle. In general, spring rate increases with inflation pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stopping distance===
Performance-oriented tires have a tread pattern and rubber compounds designed to grip the road surface, and so usually have a slightly shorter stopping distance. However, specific braking tests are necessary for data beyond generalizations.

===Work load===
The work load of a tire is monitored so that it is not put under undue stress, which may lead to its premature failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sae.org/technical/standards/J1098_199505|author=SAE|title=TKPH application|accessdate=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work load is measured in ''Ton Kilometer Per Hour'' (TKPH). The measurement's appellation and units are the same. The recent shortage and increasing cost of tires for [[Construction &amp; Mining Trucks#Off-road dump truck|heavy equipment]] has made TKPH an important parameter in tire selection and equipment maintenance for the mining industry. For this reason, [[:Category:Tire manufacturers|manufacturers of tires]] for large earth-moving and mining vehicles assign TKPH ratings to their tires based on their size, construction, tread type, and rubber compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.firestone.co.za/content.asp?id=186|author=Bridgestone|title=How to use TKPH|accessdate=October 7, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927202203/http://www.firestone.co.za/content.asp?id=186 |archivedate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.goodyear.com/media/pr/pr_2000/22169oh.html|author=Goodyear|title=New temperature prediction model improves on current TKPH formula|accessdate=October 7, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106074110/http://www.goodyear.com/media/pr/pr_2000/22169oh.html |archivedate=November 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rating is based on the weight and speed that the tire can handle without overheating and causing it to deteriorate prematurely. The equivalent measure used in the United States is ''Ton Mile Per Hour'' (TMPH).

[[File:Tire performance envelope.svg|thumb|Tire performance envelope by Goodyear]]

===Tread wear===
There are several types of abnormal tread wear. Poor [[wheel alignment]] can cause excessive wear of the innermost or outermost ribs. Gravel roads, rocky terrain, and other rough terrain causes accelerated wear. Over-inflation above the sidewall maximum can cause excessive wear to the center of the tread. Modern tires have steel belts built in to prevent this. Under-inflation causes excessive wear to the outer ribs. Unbalanced wheels can cause uneven tire wear, as the rotation may not be perfectly circular.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Tire manufacturers and car companies have mutually established standards for tread wear testing that include measurement parameters for tread loss profile, lug count, and heel-toe wear. ''See also [[#Work load|Work load]] above.''

===Wet traction===
Wet traction is the tire's [[Traction (engineering)|traction]], or grip, under wet conditions. Wet traction is improved by the tread design's ability to channel water out of the tire footprint and reduce [[Aquaplaning|hydroplaning]]. However, tires with a circular cross-section, such as those found on racing bicycles, when properly inflated have a sufficiently small footprint to not be susceptible to hydroplaning. For such tires, it is observed that fully slick tires will give superior traction on both wet and dry pavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tires.html|title=Sheldon Brown on tires|accessdate=2008-07-01|last=Brown|first=Sheldon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Markings==

===DOT code===
[[File:Dotnummer.jpg|thumb|Tire manufactured in 10th week of 2001]]
The '''DOT Code''' is an [[alphanumeric]] character sequence molded into the sidewall of the tire and allows the identification of the tire and its age. The code is mandated by the [[United States Department of Transportation|U.S. Department of Transportation]]&lt;ref name = DoT&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/49/574.5 "49 CFR 574.5 - Tire identification requirements."].&lt;/ref&gt; but is used worldwide.{{citation needed|date = April 2017}}

The DOT Code begins with the letters "DOT" followed by a plant code (two numbers or letters) that represents the manufacturing plant. The last four numbers represent the week and year the tire was built. A three-digit code was used for tires manufactured before 2000. For example, 178 means it was manufactured in the 17th week of 8th year of the decade. In this case it means 1988. For tires manufactured in the 1990s, the same code holds true, but there is a little triangle (Δ) after the DOT code. Thus, a tire manufactured in the 17th week of 1998 would have the code 178Δ. In 2000, the code was switched to a 4-digit code. Same rules apply, so for example, 3003 means the tire was manufactured in the 30th week of 2003.&lt;ref name = DoT/&gt;

Other numbers are marketing codes used at the manufacturer's discretion. The DOT Code is also useful in identifying tires subject to [[product recall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodyear.com/en-US/tires/recall|title=Goodyear Tire Recall - Goodyear Tires|website=www.goodyear.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at end of life due to age.  The [[British Rubber Manufacturers Association]] (BRMA) recommended practice, issued June 2001, states, "BRMA members strongly recommend that unused tyres should not be put into service if they are over six years old and that all tyres should be replaced ten years from the date of their manufacture."

===E-mark===
All tires sold for road use in Europe after July 1997 must carry an E-mark. The mark itself is either an upper case "E" or lower case "e"&amp;nbsp;– followed by a number in a circle or rectangle, followed by a further number. An (upper case) "E" indicates that the tire is certified to comply with the dimensional, performance and marking requirements of ECE regulation 30. A (lower case) "e" indicates that the tire is certified to comply with the dimensional, performance and marking requirements of Directive 92/23/EEC. The number in the circle or rectangle denotes the country code of the government that granted the type approval. The last number outside the circle or rectangle is the number of the type approval certificate issued for that particular tire size and type.

===Mold serial number===
Tire manufacturers usually embed a mold serial number into the sidewall area of the mold, so that the tire, once molded, can be traced back to the mold of original manufacturer.

===Size Codes===
{{Main article|Tire code}}Automobile tires are described by an alphanumeric code, which is generally molded into the sidewall of the tire. This code specifies the dimensions of the tire, and some of its key limitations, such as load-bearing ability, and maximum speed. Sometimes the inner sidewall contains information not included on the outer sidewall, and vice versa.

The code has grown in complexity over the years, as is evident from the mix of metric and English units, and ad-hoc extensions to lettering and numbering schemes. New automotive tires frequently have ratings for traction, treadwear, and temperature resistance (collectively known as The [[UTQG|Uniform Tire Quality Grade (UTQG) ratings]]).

Most tires sizes are given using the ISO Metric sizing system. However, some [[pickup trucks]] and [[SUV]]s use the [[Tire code#Flotation Sizes|Light Truck Numeric or Light Truck High Flotation]] system.
==Vehicle applications==
&lt;!-- [[OTR]] links to this section --&gt;

Tires are classified into several standard types, based on the type of vehicle they serve. Since the manufacturing process, raw materials, and equipment vary according to the tire type, it is common for tire factories to specialize in one or more tire types. In most markets, factories that manufacture passenger and light truck radial tires are separate and distinct from those that make aircraft or off-the-road (OTR) tires.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Passenger vehicles and light truck===

====High-performance====
High-performance tires are designed for use at higher speeds, and more often, a more "sporty" driving style. They feature a softer rubber compound for improved traction, especially on high speed cornering. The trade off of this softer rubber is shorter tread life.

High-performance street tires sometimes sacrifice wet weather handling by having shallower water channels to provide more actual rubber tread surface area for dry weather performance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The ability to provide a high level of performance on both wet and dry pavement varies widely among manufacturers, and even among tire models of the same manufacturer. This is an area of active research and development, as well as marketing.

Dedicated winter tires will bear the "Mountain/Snowflake Pictograph" if designated as a winter/[[snow tire]] by the American Society for Testing &amp; Materials.&lt;ref&gt;

Some winter tires are fabricated to allow the optional insertion of metal studs (consisting of a [[tungsten carbide]] or other hard material pin embedded in a base of a softer metal) for additional traction on icy roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8v2VW0V9p8wC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=Tungsten+carbide+tire+studs |title=The truth about studded tires |first=Jan |last=Norbye |pages=76–77 |journal=Popular Science |date=November 1972 |volume=201 |issue=5 |accessdate=29 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of studs is restricted in some countries due to the increased road wear that they cause, with the notable exception of most Nordic and North American jurisdictions, where they are commonly used in colder areas during the winter season. Norway has implemented fees for using studded tires in some urban areas, and there are a few streets in some of the major cities in Sweden where studs are not allowed. In America, studs are typically never used on heavier vehicles (except for some emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks.), but stud tires for heavy vehicles are commonplace in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.no/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=no&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http://www.tungt.no/transportmagasinet/article684030.ece&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url|title=Google Oversetter|website=translate.google.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ice resurfacer]]s also use studded tires.
The upper tier classes of [[ice racing]]&lt;ref name="MotorTrend"&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.motortrend.com/features/112_0407_ice_racing/index.html |title=Racing Fast 'n' Cheap: Ice Racing |last=Markus |first=Frank |journal=Motor Trend |date=July 2004 |accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rallying]] mandates the vehicles be equipped with studded tires.

Other winter tires rely on factors other than studding for traction on ice, e.g. highly porous or [[hydrophilic]] rubber that adheres to the wet film on the ice surface. The best stud-less winter tires offer grip close to that of studded tires during most winter conditions, with the notable exception of blank or polished ice, where they cannot match the performance of studded tires. The reason for this is that stud-less winter tires rely on unevenness in the ice surface for their sipes to grab, while studs cut into even the most polished ice surface (and in the process also make it uneven).

Studded tires are also used on bicycles, and the grip advantage on ice is similar to that from using traction sand, with the difference that there is no risk of blank spots when using studded tires. Quality tire manufacturers use studs with hard center pins also for bicycle tires, and just like their automobile counterparts, those studs will continue to protrude from the tire even after many years of usage on bare pavement. There are also low-quality studded bicycle tires being sold that have studs that lack the hard-metal center pin (there is still a center pin, but it is not made of hard metal). Such studs can wear out within a few weeks of cycling on dry pavement.

Some jurisdictions may require snow tires or [[tire chain]]s on vehicles driven in certain areas during extreme weather conditions.

====Mud tires====
Mud tires are specialty tires with large, chunky tread patterns designed to penetrate soft material, such as mud, snow, or sand. The large, open design also allows mud to clear from between the lugs more easily then from traditional designs. Mud tires tend to be wider than other tires, to spread the weight of the vehicle over a greater area to prevent the vehicle from sinking too deeply into the soft material.

On sufficiently thin layers of soft material, however, narrow tires can be helpful because the tires will have more pressure in the contact patch, which enables the tires to penetrate a loose top layer and grip firmer material or pavement below. This does not work when the soft material is too deep, in which case the vehicle will sink into the into it and may become unable to compact or push it out of the way. In this case, wider tires may work better, as they can have a larger contact patch and are better able to 'float' on top of the soft material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mud tires also feature self-cleaning design, which is helpful in off-road situations and helps prevent sticky material, such as mud or snow, from accumulating in the gaps between lugs. Mud tires can also perform well on rocky terrain and provide good grip and traction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mud Terrain Tires vs All-Terrain Tires: Comparison |url=https://autocarspec.com/mud-terrain-vs-all-terrain-tires-pros-cons-comparison.html |date= April 2017 |publisher=AutoCarSpec}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====All season====
The All Season tire classification is a compromise between one developed for use on dry and wet roads during summer and one developed for use under winter conditions. The type of rubber and the tread pattern best suited for use under summer conditions cannot, for technical reasons, give good performance on snow and ice. The all-season tire is a compromise, and is neither an excellent summer tire nor an excellent winter tire. They have, however, become ubiquitous as original and replacement equipment on automobiles marketed in the United States, due to their convenience and their adequate performance in most situations. Even so, in other parts of the world, like Germany, it is common to have a designated tire set for winter and summer. All-Season tires are also marked for mud and snow the same as winter tires but rarely with a snowflake. Owing to the compromise with performance during summer, winter performance is usually poorer than a winter tire.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

====All-terrain====
All-terrain tires are typically used on [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s and [[light truck]]s. These tires often have stiffer sidewalls for greater resistance against puncture when traveling off-road, the tread pattern offers wider spacing than all-season tires to remove mud from the tread. Many tires in the all-terrain category are designed primarily for on-road use, particularly all-terrain tires that are originally sold with the vehicle.

====Spare====
{{Main article|spare tire}}
Some vehicles carry a spare tire, already mounted on a wheel, to be used in the event of flat tire or [[Blowout (tire)|blowout]]. Minispare, or "space-saver spare" tires are smaller than normal tires to save on trunk/boot space, gas mileage, weight, and cost. Minispares have a short life expectancy and a low speed rating, often below {{convert|60|mph}}.

====Light trailer====
[[Trailer (vehicle)|Domestic Trailers]] (including camping trailers) for use on public highways often have different tires than those seen on cars. Often they are [[bias ply]] rather than [[radial tire]]s, and they often don't have as aggressive a tread pattern as standard road tires. They are not built for high traction in most cases, because in most cases it is not vital that trailer tires have as good a traction as that of the vehicle towing the trailer.

====Run-flat====
{{Main article|Run-flat tire}}
Several innovative designs have been introduced that permit tires to run safely with no air for a limited range at a limited speed. These tires typically feature strong, load-supporting sidewalls. Another approach is an auxiliary support structure fixed to the rim inside the pneumatic tyre that will bear the load in the event of a deflation.

A disadvantage is that many run-flat tires cannot be repaired if a puncture occurs. This is due to manufacturer's informing the automotive industry that the state in which the sidewall is in cannot be determined due to the compacted sidewall of rubber. Some brands may permit one repair to a run flat tire, while others do not allow any.

===Heavy duty truck===
[[File:Bay Crane Liebherr Union St 39 Av jeh.jpg|thumb|Heavy load may require multiple tires]]
Heavy duty tires are also referred to as Truck/Bus tires. These are the tire sizes used on vehicles such as commercial freight trucks, dump trucks, and passenger buses. Truck tires are sub-categorized into specialties according to vehicle position such as steering, drive axle, and trailer. Each type is designed with the reinforcements, material compounds, and tread patterns that best optimize the tire performance.  A relatively new concept is the use of "Super Singles" or Wide Singles.  Generally in a dual configuration, there are 2 tires per position, each between 275&amp;nbsp;mm-295&amp;nbsp;mm wide.  The Super Single replaces these with a single tire, usually 455&amp;nbsp;mm wide.  This allows for less tread to be contacting the ground and also eliminates 2 sidewalls per position.  Along with the weight savings of about {{convert|200|lb|order=flip}} per axle, this enables vehicles using these to improve fuel economy.

===Off-the-road===
[[File:Gianttires ontruck.jpg|thumb|Off-the-road (OTR) tires being transported]]
Off-the-road (OTR) tires include all tires not running on the common roads, such as fitted on construction vehicles (wheel loaders, backhoes, graders, trenchers), on airplanes, on mining vehicles, on forestry machinery. OTR tires can be of either bias or radial construction although the industry is trending toward increasing use of radial. Bias OTR tires are built with a large number of reinforcing plies to withstand severe service conditions and high loads.

Dramatically increasing commodity prices has led to shortages of new tires. As a consequence, multimillion-dollar trucks can be idled for lack of tires, costing mines millions of dollars in lost productivity. This has led to a stronger effort to recycle old OTR tires. As of 2008, a new OTR tire can cost up to $50,000; retread tires are sold at half the price of new tires, and last 80% as long.&lt;ref&gt;My Kingdom for a Tire, Business Week, April 21, 2008, pp. 46–48&lt;/ref&gt; Retreading an OTR tire is labor-intensive. First, the retreading technician must place the old tire in a buffing machine to remove what remains of the old tread; "skiving" follows this, which is the removal, by hand, of material the buffing misses. Next, the technician must inspect the tire, repairing defects. Lastly, the technician fills holes in the tire with rubber, applies a cement gum adhesive, and places the tire on a machine that will apply a new tread.&lt;ref&gt;My Kingdom for a Tire, Business Week, April 21, 2008, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural and off-road flotation tires===
[[File:TLF 8 Feuerwehr Wangerooge.jpg|thumb|[[Unimog]] [[water tender]] with flotation tires]]
The agricultural tire classification includes tires used on farm vehicles, typically tractors and specialty vehicles like harvesters. Driven wheels have very deep, widely spaced lugs to allow the tire to grip soil easily.

For off-road driving in a passenger vehicle, such as in mud, sand, or deep snow, high flotation tires are typically used. Flotation tires are not the same as M+S tires, as they are designed for low speeds and full-time off-road use rather than muddy and snow-covered roads. Flotation tires also help traction in swampy environments and where [[soil compaction]] is a concern, featuring large footprints at low inflation pressures to spread out the area where the rubber meets the ground. Knobby tires are particularly useful where the ground consists of loose particles that can be displaced by the knobs. Although the low pressure improves traction in many types of terrain, adjustments may need to be made for hard surfaces like paved and unpaved roads. Vehicles that use flotation tires for rock climbing are susceptible to flat tires in which the tire pops off the rim, breaking the "bead."

===Racing===
[[File:Nascarphx16.jpg|thumb|[[NASCAR]] tires]]
Racing tires are highly specialized according to vehicle and [[race track]] conditions. This classification includes tires for drag racing, Auto-x, drifting, Time Attack, Road Racing &amp;nbsp;– as well as the large-market race tires for [[Formula One]], [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]], [[NASCAR]], [[V8 Supercars]], [[World Rally Championship|WRC]], [[MotoGP]] and the like. Tires are specially engineered for specific race tracks according to surface conditions, cornering loads, and track temperature. Racing tires often are engineered to minimum weight targets, so tires for a {{convert|500|mi|adj=on}} race may run only {{convert|100|mi}} before a tire change. Some tire makers invest heavily in race tire development as part of the company's [[marketing strategy]] and a means of [[advertising]] to attract customers.
Racing tires used on tarmac stages are called slick. When the road is wet a driver will use intermediary slicks and when the road is dry the soft slicks are used. 
Racing tires often are not legal for normal highway use.

===Industrial===
The Industrial tire classification is a bit of a catch-all category and includes pneumatic and non-pneumatic tires for specialty industrial and construction equipment such as [[skid loader]]s and [[fork lift]] trucks.
[[File:Bicycle tire - Cheng Shin.jpg|thumb|upright|Bicycle street tire]]

===Bicycle===
{{Main article|Bicycle tire}}
This classification includes all forms of [[bicycle]] tires, including road racing tires, [[mountain bike]] tires, snow tires, and [[Tubular tyres|tubular tires]], used also with other human-powered vehicles (see [[:Category:Human-powered vehicles]]).

===Aircraft===
{{further information|Landing gear}}

[[File:Boeing-777-300 chassis .jpg|thumb|Tires on the wheels of a [[Bogie#Bogie (aircraft)|bogie]] on a [[Boeing 777]]]]
Aircraft tires are designed to withstand extremely heavy loads for short durations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brc7AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Aircraft+tires+designed+to+withstand+extremely+heavy+loads+for+short+duration&amp;dq=Aircraft+tires+designed+to+withstand+extremely+heavy+loads+for+short+duration&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFn_q6y77VAhXCz1QKHUF9DKIQ6AEIQTAF|title=Aerospace safety|last=Force|first=United States Dept of the Air|date=1974|publisher=for sale by the Supt. of Docs., U.S. Govt. Print. Off.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of tires required for aircraft increases with the weight of the aircraft (because the weight of the airplane has to be distributed better). Aircraft tire tread patterns are designed to facilitate stability in high [[crosswind]] conditions, to channel water away to prevent hydroplaning, and for braking effect.

Aircraft tires are usually inflated with [[nitrogen]] to minimize expansion and contraction from extreme changes in ambient temperature and pressure experienced during flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAD.nsf/0/55850e6389efba3c8625695b006723a3!OpenDocument#_Section1 | title=FAA Airworthiness Directive | accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry nitrogen expands at the same rate as other dry atmospheric gases (normal air is about 80% nitrogen), but common compressed air sources may contain moisture, which increases the expansion rate with temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://getnitrogen.org/why/| title= Why Nitrogen | accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft tires generally operate at high pressures, up to {{convert|200|psi|bar kPa|lk=on}} for airliners, and even higher for business jets. Tests of airliner aircraft tires have shown that they are able to sustain pressures of maximum {{convert|800|psi|bar kPa}} before bursting. During the tests the tires have to be filled with water, to prevent the test room being blown apart by the energy that would be released by a gas when the tire bursts.

Aircraft tires also include [[fusible plug]]s (which are assembled on the inside of the wheels), designed to melt at a certain temperature. Tires often overheat if maximum braking is applied during an aborted takeoff or an [[emergency landing]]. The fuses provide a safer failure mode that prevents tire explosions by deflating in a controlled manner, thus minimizing damage to aircraft and objects in the surrounding environment.

The requirement that an inert gas, such as nitrogen, be used instead of air for inflation of tires on certain transport category airplanes was prompted by at least three cases in which the oxygen in air-filled tires combined with volatile gases given off by a severely overheated tire and exploded upon reaching [[autoignition temperature]]. The use of an inert gas for tire inflation will eliminate the possibility of a tire explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration, Use of Nitrogen or Other Inert Gas for Tire Inflation in Lieu of Air&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motorcycle===
{{Main article|Motorcycle tyre}}There are many different types of motorcycle tires.

==Sound and vibration characteristics==
{{Main article|Roadway noise}}
The design of treads and the interaction of specific tire types with the roadway surface type produces considerable effect upon sound levels or [[noise pollution]] emanating from moving vehicles. These sound intensities increase with higher vehicle speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00159677| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x1707075n815g604/ |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |title=Analysis of highway noise |journal=Journal of Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=387–392 |date=September 1973 |publisher=Springer Verlag |issn=0049-6979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acoustic intensity produced varies considerably depending on the tire tread design and the road surface type.

==Regulatory bodies==

===DOT===
The [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT) is the U.S. governmental body authorized by the U.S. Congress to establish and regulate transportation safety in the United States of America.

===NHTSA===
The [[National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) is a U.S. government body within the Department of Transportation tasked with regulating automotive safety in the United States.

===UTQG===
The Uniform Tire Quality Grading System ([[UTQG]]), is a system for comparing the performance of tires, established by the United States [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] according to the Code of Federal Regulations 49 CFR 575.104. The UTQG regulation requires labeling of tires for tread wear, traction, and temperature.

===T&amp;RA===
The [[Tire and Rim Association]] (T&amp;RA) is a voluntary U.S. standards organization to promote the interchangeability of tires and rim and allied parts. Of particular interest, they published key tire dimension standards, key rim contour dimension standards, key tire valve dimension standards, and load / inflation standards.

===ETRTO===
The [[European Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation]] (ETRTO) is the European standards organisation "to establish engineering dimensions, load/pressure characteristics and operating guidelines" .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=ETRTO Standards Manual 2007 | year=2007| publisher=ETRTO |location=Bruxelles, Belgium | pages=I }}&lt;/ref&gt;
for tires, rims and valves. It is analogous to T&amp;RA.

===JATMA===
The [[Japanese Automobile Tire Manufacturers Association]] (JATMA) is the Japanese standards organization for tires, rims and valves. It is analogous to T&amp;RA and ETRTO.

===INMETRO===
The [[National Institute of Metrology Standardization and Industrial Quality]] (INMETRO) is the Brazilian federal body responsible for automotive wheel and tyre certification.

===CCC===
CCC (China Compulsory Certification) is a mandatory certification system concerning product safety in China that went into effect in August 2002. Before CCC, there were two certification systems in China: CCIB and CCEE. With China's entrance into the WTO, these two systems were unified into the CCC certification system. After the termination of a one-year grace period in August 2003, the system became compulsory.The CCC certification system is operated by the State General Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China (AQSIQ) and the Certification and Accreditation Administration of the People's Republic of China (CNCA).

==Safety==
Proper vehicle safety requires specific attention to inflation pressure, tread depth, and general condition of the tires. Over-inflated tires run the risk of explosive decompression (they may pop). On the other hand, under-inflated tires have a higher rolling resistance and suffer from overheating and rapid tread wear particularly on the edges of the tread. As tire tread decreases, there is more traction between the tire and the road resulting in better grip. However, there is an increased risk of hydroplaning, so as the tire wears the performance in the dry generally improves, but gets worse in the wet. Tires worn down past their safety margins and into the casing run the very real risk of rupturing. Also, certain combinations of cross ply and radial tires on different wheels of the same vehicle can lead to vehicle instability, and may also be illegal. Vehicle and tire manufacturers provide owners' manuals with instructions on how to check and maintain tires.

A controversy began in 2000 regarding [[Firestone and Ford tire controversy|unusually high tire failures]] on some Ford vehicles. This resulted in the recall of the tires in question.

===Flat===
{{Main article|Flat tire}}
[[File:2008-08-19 Flat tire.jpg|thumb|A flat tire]]
A flat tire occurs when a tire deflates. This can occur as a result of normal wear-and-tear, a leak, or more serious damage. A tire that has lost sufficient pressure will impair the stability of the vehicle and may damage the tire further if it is driven in this condition. The tire should be changed and/or repaired before it becomes completely flat. Continuing to drive a vehicle with a flat tire will damage the tire beyond repair, possibly damage the rim and vehicle, and put the occupants and other vehicles in danger. A flat tire or low-pressure tire should be considered an emergency situation, requiring immediate attention. Some tires, known as "[[run-flat tire]]s", have either extremely stiff sidewalls or a resilient filler to allow driving a limited distance while flat, usually at reduced speed, without permanent damage or hazard.

A modern radial tire may not be visibly distorted even with dangerously low inflation pressure. (This is especially true of tires with a low aspect ratio, sometimes known as "low profile" tires.) Thus maintenance of adequate tire pressure can have important safety implications despite the fact that most car owners neglect it. Tire designers have tried to make new tires fail-safe so that the failure of the operator to maintain the tire pressure won't cause a major safety concern, but there are limitations on this.

===Bubble===
[[File:Tire_bubble.jpg#|thumb|upright|Tire bubble]]
Tire bubbles, also referred to as bulges / bumps / protrusions / carbuncles, occur when the sidewall of the tire has failed, resulting in a protrusion. Causes of bubbles include having an impact at high speed, overinflation, or poor tire construction/manufacturing. It is generally recommended to replace the tire since the probability of tire failure has increased. They can occur on the inner or outer sidewall.  This can sometimes be seen easily when looking at the symmetry of the [[tire lettering]] on the sidewall of the tire.

===Hydroplaning (or aquaplaning)===
{{Main article|Hydroplaning (road vehicle)}}
Hydroplaning, also known as aquaplaning, is the condition where a layer of water builds up between the tire and road surface. Hydroplaning occurs when the tread pattern cannot channel away enough water at an adequate rate to ensure a semi-dry footprint area. Hydroplaning is more prevalent with wider tires and at higher speeds. When hydroplaning occurs, the tire effectively "floats" above the road surface on a cushion of water&amp;nbsp;– and loses traction, braking and steering, creating a very unsafe driving condition. When hydroplaning occurs, there is considerably less responsiveness of the steering wheel. The correction of this unsafe condition is to gradually reduce speed, by merely lifting off the accelerator/gas pedal.

===Dangers of aged tires===

Research and tests show that as tires age, they begin to dry out and become potentially dangerous, even if unused. Aged tires may appear to have similar properties to newly manufactured tires, but rubber degrades over time, and once the vehicle is traveling at high speeds (i.e. on a [[freeway]]) the tread could peel off, leading to severe loss of control. In tropical climates, tires degrade sooner than in temperate climates, and more care should be taken in these climates to ensure that tires do not fail.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Also, tires on seldom-used trailers are at the greatest risk of age-failure, but some tires are built to withstand idleness, usually with nylon reinforcement.

[[File:Weather-cracked Tire.JPG|thumb|Tire showing weather-cracking over long-term exposure to the weather]]

Many automakers recommend replacing tires after six years, and several tire manufacturers ([[Bridgestone]], [[Michelin]]) have called for tires to be removed from service 10 years after the date of manufacture. However, an investigative report by Brian Ross on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]] news magazine found that many major retailers such as [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]], [[Wal-Mart]], and [[Sears]] were selling tires that had been produced six or more years ago. Currently, no law for aged tires exists in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Story?id=4822250&amp;page=2 |title=ABC News: Aged Tires Sold as 'New' by Big Retailers |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=05/09/2008 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=4826897 |title=Aged Tires: A Driving Hazard? |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2008-05-09 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scrap tires and environmental issues===
[[File:TirePlayground.jpg|thumb|A child plays in a playground made from recycled tires. Guelph, Ontario]]
Once tires are discarded, they are considered '''[[scrap tires]]'''. Scrap tires are often re-used for things from bumper car barriers to weights to hold down tarps. Some facilities are permitted to recycle scrap tires through chipping, and processing into new products, or selling the material to licensed power plants for fuel. Some tires may also be retreaded for re-use. One group did "a study to evaluate the possibility of using scrap tires as a crash cushion system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the material properties of used tires and recycled tire-derived materials for use in low-cost, reusable crash cushions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Testing and evaluation of used automobile tires and recycled tire-derived materials for low-cost crash cushions | last=Hossain | last2=Nabors | first=Mustaque | first2=Daniel | date=Jan–Feb 2005 | volume=36 | issue=9 | publisher=Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering | accessdate=2010-10-23 | url=http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?0500902 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725015346/http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?0500902 | archivedate=2011-07-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans generate about 285 million scrap tires per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tire-Derived Fuel |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/conserve/materials/tires/tdf.htm| accessdate=2011-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states have regulations as to the number of scrap tires that can be held on site, due to concerns with dumping, fire hazards, and mosquitoes. In the past, millions of tires have been discarded into open fields. This creates a breeding ground for mosquitoes, since the tires often hold water inside and remain warm enough for mosquito breeding. Mosquitoes create a nuisance and may increase the likelihood of spreading disease. It also creates a fire danger, since such a large tire pile is a lot of fuel. Some [[tire fire]]s have burned for months, since water does not adequately penetrate or cool the burning tires. Tires have been known to liquefy, releasing hydrocarbons and other contaminants to the ground and even ground water, under extreme heat and temperatures from a fire. The black smoke from a tire fire causes air pollution and is a hazard to down wind properties.

The use of scrap tire chips for landscaping has become controversial, due to the leaching of metals and other contaminants from the tire pieces. Zinc is concentrated (up to 2% by weight) to levels high enough to be highly toxic to aquatic life and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=An Assessment of Environmental Toxicity and Potential Contamination from Artificial Turf using Shredded or Crumb Rubber| last=Sullivan |first=Joseph P.| year=2006| url=http://www.ardeacon.com/pdf/Assessment_Environmental_Toxicity_Report.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=2009-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular concern is evidence that some of the compounds that leach from tires into water, contain hormone disruptors and cause liver lesions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Myth of Rubberized Landscapes |first=Linda |last=Chalker-Scott |url=http://www.puyallup.wsu.edu/~Linda%20Chalker-Scott/Horticultural%20Myths_files/Myths/Rubber%20mulch.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007125638/http://www.puyallup.wsu.edu/~Linda%20Chalker-Scott/Horticultural%20Myths_files/Myths/Rubber%20mulch.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asymmetric tire==
An '''asymmetric tire''' is a kind of specific stabilization method used in [[car]]s.

===Tire tread===
An asymmetric tire may refer to a tire whose [[tread|tread pattern]] does not form in [[line symmetry]] or [[point symmetry]] vis-à-vis its central line, thus having a distinct inside and outside edge. They may be mounted on either side of the vehicle. Since the tread pattern of many ordinary tires do not form symmetry in relation to design or pattern noise, the method of mounting tires is specially prescribed. This type of tires is used in many cases to promote tire performance, braking performance, and turning performance, since tread contact changes according to the change in alignment during travel.

Tires may also be directional, where the tread pattern favors operation in one direction. This usually takes the form of v-shaped grooves that help to disperse water from the center to the edge of the tread. Symmetric directional tires can be used on both sides, but once mounted on a rim cannot be moved to the other side, since the tread pattern will be in the wrong direction. This restricts tire rotation. Some directional tires are also asymmetric, in which case there will be specific left and right-handed versions.

===Stabilizing belts===
An asymmetric tire may refer to a [[Automobile|passenger car]] radial tire in which asymmetric structure stabilizing belts are built. Generally the stabilizing belts give a self-aligning [[torque]] when a motor vehicle is running straight ahead as well as when it is cornering. However, the sidewalls of the radial tire are so flexible that there will be a delay in the lateral reaction between the tread of the tire and the rim of its wheel as the vehicle is being steered positively. The lateral force will be transmitted from the front wheel to the rear of the vehicle, which will tend to be steered off course. Whereas the asymmetric belts bring a gradual change in the lateral displacement of the tire tread corresponding to the rim while the cornering load grows. The progressive change will harden the sidewalls to produce an immediate response to steering, which results in safer driving.

==Other uses==
Tires are not desired at [[landfills]], due to their large volumes and 75% void space, which quickly consumes valuable space.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, H., Mead, J., Stacer, R. Chelsea Center For Recycling And Economic Development. (1998).  Environmental Impacts Of Recycling Rubber In Light Fill Applications: Summary &amp; Evaluation Of Existing Literature University of Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, people have found other uses for old tires.

Rubber tires are likely to contain some traces of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s or other serious [[pollutant]]s, but these are tightly bonded within the actual rubber compound they are unlikely to be hazardous unless the tire structure is seriously damaged by fire or strong chemicals.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Tire swing===
[[File:Three Boys on a Tire Swing.JPG|thumb|Three boys on a tire swing]]
Old tires are sometimes converted into a [[Swing (seat)|swing]] for play.  The innovative use allows for an easy way to find a purpose for an existing old tire not suitable for road use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to-plans/backyard-tire-swing-project|publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]]|title=One Day Project: Kid's Backyard Tire Swing|accessdate=April 1, 2013|first= Harry |last=Sawyers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise equipment===
Used tires are employed as exercise equipment for athletic programs such as [[American football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://football.about.com/od/Football-Conditioning/a/Football-Tire-Drills.htm|publisher=About.com|title=No Frills Football Conditioning|first=Sean|last=McCormick|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403200128/http://football.about.com/od/Football-Conditioning/a/Football-Tire-Drills.htm|archivedate=2013-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One classic conditioning drill that hones players' speed and agility is the "Tire Run" where tires are laid out side by side, with each tire on the left a few inches ahead of the tire on the right in a zigzag pattern.  Athletes then run through the tire pattern by stepping in the center of each tire. The drill forces athletes to lift their feet above the ground higher than normal to avoid tripping on the tires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/317036-football-tire-drills/#ixzz2PFqqQ6Wa|publisher=[[LiveStrong]]|title=Football Tire Drills|accessdate=April 1, 2013|date=November 24, 2010|first=Jae|last=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tire Pyrolysis====
The [[tire pyrolysis]] method for recycling used tires is a technique which heats whole or shredded tires in a reactor vessel containing an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|oxygen-free]] atmosphere and a heat source. In the reactor the [[rubber]] is softened after which the rubber polymers continuously break down into smaller molecules.

[[Image:Light-wave.svg|thumb|305px|A [[light]] wave is an example of a transverse [[electromagnetic wave]]; the shape of the wave is one of the [[sinusoidal plane-wave solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation]].]]
[[Image:Ondes cisaillement 2d 20 petit.gif|thumb|305px|Propagation of a transverse spherical wave in a 2d grid (empirical model)]]

A '''transverse wave''' is a moving wave that consists of oscillations occurring perpendicular (right angled) to the direction of energy transfer (or the propagation of the wave). &lt;!--In other words: in matter, the displacement of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave.  &lt;&lt; This is actually already said in the first sentence of the following paragraph.--&gt;

If a transverse wave is moving in the positive ''x''-direction, its oscillations are in up and down directions that lie in the ''y–z'' plane.

Light is an example of a transverse wave, while sound is a [[longitudinal wave]]. A ripple in a pond and a wave on a string are easily visualized as transverse waves.

== Explanation == 
Transverse waves are waves that are oscillating perpendicularly (at a right angle) to the direction of propagation. If you anchor one end of a ribbon or string and hold the other end in your hand, you can create transverse waves by moving your hand up and down. Notice though, that you can also launch waves by moving your hand side-to-side. This is an important point. There are two independent directions in which wave motion can occur. In this case, these motions are the ''Y'' and ''Z'' directions mentioned above, while the wave propagates away in the ''X'' direction. The other type of waves is the [[longitudinal wave]], which oscillates in the direction of its propagation.
=== "Polarized" waves ===
{{Main|Polarization (waves)}}
Continuing with the string example, if you move your hand in a clockwise circle, you will launch waves in the form of a left-handed helix as they propagate away. Similarly, if you move your hand in a counter-clockwise circle, a right-handed helix will form. These phenomena of ''simultaneous'' motion in two directions go beyond the kinds of waves we observe on the surface of water - in that a wave on a string can be ''two-dimensional''. 

Two-dimensional transverse waves exhibit a phenomenon called [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]. A wave produced by moving your hand in a straight line, up and down for instance, is a [[linear polarization|linearly polarized]] wave, a special case. A wave produced by moving your hand in a circle or an [[ellipse]] is a [[circular polarization|circularly]] or [[elliptical polarization|elliptically polarized]] wave, two other special cases.

===  Electromagnetic waves === 
Electromagnetic waves behave in this same way&lt;!--, although it is slightly harder to see  &lt;&lt; "slightly harder to see"?  This claim should be explained. --&gt;. Electromagnetic waves are also two-dimensional transverse waves. 
Transverse waves are waves that travel perpendicular to the direction of the vibration.
Ray theory does not describe phenomena such as interference and diffraction, which require wave theory (involving the phase of the wave).
You can think of a [[Ray (optics)|ray of light]], in [[optics]], as an idealized narrow beam of electromagnetic radiation. Rays are used to model the propagation of [[light]] through an optical system, by dividing the real light field up into discrete rays that can be computationally propagated through the system by the techniques of [[Ray tracing (physics)|ray tracing]]. &lt;ref name=zmx1&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://kb-en.radiantzemax.com/Knowledgebase/What-is-a-ray  |title=What is a ray?  |first=Ken  |last=Moore  |date=2005-07-25  |work=ZEMAX Users' Knowledge Base  |accessdate=2008-05-30  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130624192746/http://kb-en.radiantzemax.com/Knowledgebase/What-is-a-ray  |archivedate=2013-06-24  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;            
A light ray is a line or curve that is perpendicular to the light's wavefronts (and is therefore collinear with the wave vector). Light rays bend at the interface between two dissimilar media and may be curved in a medium in which the [[refractive index]] changes. Geometric optics describes how rays propagate through an optical system.&lt;ref name=zmx1&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://kb-en.radiantzemax.com/Knowledgebase/What-is-a-ray  |title=What is a ray?  |first=Ken  |last=Moore  |date=2005-07-25  |work=ZEMAX Users' Knowledge Base  |accessdate=2008-05-30  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130624192746/http://kb-en.radiantzemax.com/Knowledgebase/What-is-a-ray  |archivedate=2013-06-24  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;            

This two-dimensional nature should not be confused with the two components of an electromagnetic wave, the electric and magnetic field components, which are shown in the light wave diagram here.&lt;!--The light wave diagram shows [[linear polarization]].  &lt;&lt; Can linear polarization really be "shown" in a 2-dimensional graph?--&gt; Each of these fields, the electric and the magnetic, exhibits two-dimensional transverse wave behavior, just like the waves on a string.

The '''Western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests''' is a [[temperate coniferous forests]] [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]] of the middle and upper elevations of the western Middle [[Himalayas]] of [[Nepal]], [[India]], and [[Pakistan]].

==Setting==
The ecoregion forms a belt of coniferous forest covering {{convert|39700|sqkm|mi2}} on elevations between {{convert|3000|and|3500|m|ft}}. It extends west from the [[Gandaki River]] in Nepal, through the Indian states of [[Uttarakhand]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]], and into [[Jammu and Kashmir]] eastern Pakistan. This belt of conifers is the highest expanse of woodland to be found on the slopes of the Himalayas, treeless alpine scrub lying just above its ecotopic frontier. It is a valuable ecosystem as many Himalayan birds and animals migrate seasonally up and down the mountains spending part of the year in the conifer forests, so conservation is a high priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests|id=im0502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ecoregion is drier than the [[Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]], which receive more moisture from the [[Bay of Bengal]] monsoon.

==Flora==
Several distinct forest types are found in this ecoregion. Fir trees (''[[Abies spectabilis]]'') in places grow in nearly pure stands. In other areas they mix with oaks (''[[Quercus semecarpifolia]]''). ''[[Rhododendron campanulatum]]'', ''Abies spectabilis'', and birch (''[[Betula utilis]]'') form another common assemblage. Elsewhere mixed-conifer forests are made up of ''Abies spectabilis'', blue pine (''[[Pinus wallichiana]]'') and spruce (''[[Picea smithiana]]''). ''[[Cupressus torulosa]]'' and ''[[Cedrus deodara]]'' are also found here. 
A recently published major new monograph, Conifers Around the World, treats the high-level western Himalayan fir tree as Abies gamblei (apparently, A. spectabilis does not reach this region!)&lt;ref&gt;[http://conifersaroundtheworld.com/blog/abies_gamblei_gamble_fir Abies gamblei - Gamble Fir | Conifers Around the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following are some notable conifers present in the area:

[[Fir]]: [[Abies pindrow]], [[Abies spectabilis]] and [[Abies gamblei]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-2609866|title=Abies gamblei Hickel — The Plant List|website=www.theplantlist.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Pine]]: [[Pinus roxburghii]], [[Pinus wallichiana]] and [[Pinus gerardiana]].

[[Spruce]]: [[Picea smithiana]].

[[Cypress]]: [[Cupressus torulosa]].

[[Juniper]]: [[Juniperus communis]], [[Juniperus indica]], [[Juniperus squamata]], [[Juniperus recurva]], [[Juniperus excelsa subsp. polycarpos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/16336635/0|title=Juniperus excelsa subsp. polycarpos (Turkestan Juniper)|website=www.iucnredlist.org|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, etc.

[[Cedrus]]: [[Cedrus deodara]].

[[Taxus]]: [[Taxus contorta]] and [[Taxus wallichiana]].

[[Ephedra (plant)|Ephedra]]: [[Ephedra gerardiana]], [[Ephedra intermedia]].

==Fauna==
This ecoregion is home to some fifty-eight species of mammals. Important inhabitants include the [[Ursus arctos|brown bear]] and threatened or endangered species such as [[Himalayan serow]], [[Hemitragus jemlahicus|Himalayan tahr]], and the [[Capra falconeri|markhor]] goat, the national symbol of Pakistan. The only endemic mammal is a rodent, the [[murree vole]] (''Hyperacrius wynnei'').

About 285 species of birds have been recorded in this ecoregion, including 9 [[Endemism|endemic]] species and a number of birds that are sensitive to habitat disturbance and therefore likely to be vulnerable to further forest clearance. These include the [[Koklass pheasant]] (''Pucrasia macrolopha''), [[western tragopan]] (''Tragopan melanocephalus''), and the [[Himalayan monal]] (''Lophophorus impejanus'').

==Threats and conservation==
Despite being relatively thinly populated some seventy percent of the conifer forest has been cleared or degraded, partly to make way for terrace cultivation. However it still contains some of the least disturbed forests in the western Himalayas. Protected areas that contain areas of conifer forest include [[Great Himalayan National Park]] and [[Rupi Bhabha Sanctuary]] in Himachal Pradesh, [[Kishtwar National Park]] in Jammu and Kashmir,  [[Gangotri National Park]] and [[Govind Pashu Vihar Wildlife Sanctuary]] in [[Uttarakhand]], all in India, and [[Royal Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve]] in Nepal. A particular threat comes from disturbance of nesting birds during the collection of [[morel mushroom]]s in spring.

Extraction of firewood for heating among rural populations in Pakistan has degraded forests at some locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaheen |first1=Hamayun |last2= |first2= |date=2016 |title=Fuelwood consumption pattern and its impact on forest structure in Kashmir Himalayas |url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0717-92002016000200020&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |journal=[[Bosque (journal)|Bosque]] |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages= |doi=10.4067/S0717-92002016000200020   |access-date=January 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Rich was the youngest son of Captain Obadiah Rich (1758–1805) who commanded the brig ''Intrepid'' in the [[American Revolutionary War]], and his first wife Salome Lombard (1761–1807).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wellfleeet and Beyond|url=http://capecodhistory.us/genealogy/wellfleet/i3254.htm#i19525|accessdate=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1825, he co-founded the Botanic Club of Washington, and served as a joint editor of the ''American Botanical Register'', 1825-30.  Rich spent several years in Spain with his older brother, the bibliographer [[Obadiah Rich]].  He joined the Scientific Corps of the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838 as botanist, and was in the 1841 overland party headed by [[George F. Emmons]] that traveled south from the [[Oregon Territory]] along the [[Siskiyou Trail]] to upper California, before rejoining the expedition's ships in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="W"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/calbk:@field(DOCID+@lit(calbk177div0))|title=Glances at California 1847–1853 ... with a brief memoir and notes by Willard O.

Rich "found escape from having to report on the expedition's botanical collections"&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt; in the outbreak of the [[Mexican-American War]].  In November, 1846, he was appointed paymaster, with the rank of major, to the troop of United States volunteers sent to subdue California. He was accompanied by his nephews, the surveyor and artist [[William Rich Hutton]] and his younger brother [[James D. Hutton]], also a surveyor and artist.&lt;ref name="W" /&gt;

The volunteer troops were disbanded when the war ended in 1848, but Rich continued to serve as paymaster until his honorable discharge on October 31, 1849.&lt;ref name="W" /&gt;  Rich collected botanical specimens for the [[United States and Mexican Boundary Survey]] in 1848 and the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]] in 1853.  He served briefly as secretary to the United States legation in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt;

[[Rich Passage]], a tidal strait in [[Puget Sound]], was named in his honor by [[Charles Wilkes]], leader of the Exploring Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Phillips |first= James W. |title= Washington State Place Names |year= 1971 |publisher= University of Washington Press |isbn= 0-295-95158-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7187">'''Wolfgang Seiler''' (born 22 January 1940 in [[Remscheid]]) is a German biogeochemists and climatologists. Seiler was Director of  the Institute of Meteorology and Atmospheric Environmental Research (IMK-IFU) of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] and a pioneer in the basic research of biogeochemistry.

==Development==

Seiler studied from 1961 to 1969 Meteorology at the University of Mainz and graduated with a diploma. In 1970 he received his doctorate in Meteorology (Dr. rer. nat.). Ten years later he completed his habilitation at the ETH Zurich in air chemistry. From 1980 to 1982 he was lecturer at the ETH Zurich. From 1980 to 1989 he was a visiting professor at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], Atlanta, USA, and from 1989 to 1990 Research Professor of Environmental Sciences at the [[University of Virginia]], Charlottesville, USA.

==Research==

Seiler worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Meteorology, [[University of Mainz]] (1969-1985) and was head of the research group "trace gases" at the [[Max Planck Institute for Chemistry]] (MPI), Mainz (1978). Then he was  researcher at the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR), Boulder, Colorado, USA, where he worked together with [[Paul J. Crutzen]] and [[Ralph J.

'''Wood processing''' is an [[engineering]] discipline comprising the production of forest products, such as pulp and [[paper]], construction materials, and [[tall oil]]. [[Paper engineering]] is a subfield of wood processing. The major wood product categories are:  sawn timber, wood-based panels, wood chips, paper and paper products and miscellaneous others including poles and railway sleepers.  Forest product processing technologies have undergone extraordinary advances in some of the above categories. Improvements have been achieved in recovery rates, durability and protection, greater utilization of NTFPs such as various grain stalks and bamboo, and the development of new products such as reconstituted wood-panels. Progress has not been homogenous in all the forest product utilization categories. Although there is little information available on the subjects of technology acquisition, adaptation and innovation for the forest-based industrial sector, it is clear that sawmilling has been far less affected by the spread of innovations than the manufacturing of panel products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
