'''Ambilikile Mwasapile''' (born 1933 or 1935) is a Tanzanian retired priest of the Lutheran Church  who uses a tree known as mugariga to make a non-flavored drink which he administers to patients reporting various chronic diseases.

==Biography==
Rev. Mwasapile lives in Samunge village in [[Loliondo]], near Ngorongoro in northern [[Tanzania]], an area marked by the proximity of the world-famous Ngorongoro Crater, a volcanic mountain top depression and  game park with various big game.

==Vision of healing==
Rev. Mwasapile told people at that time that he had a vision in which he was instructed to make the potion he administers. His vision was of a tree that provided medicine and that many people would come to be healed. Upon waking, in the daily routine that followed, he claimed to have met a woman who had HIV, and she told him that she came for medicine. Rev. Mwasapile claims to have followed a vision, gone into the bush, and taken portions of the tree as directed.

==Popularization==
Reports of healing from Rev. Mwasapile potion spread, and he began to sell the concoction. At one point in 2011 the treatment was quite popular, although its popularity trailed off when it became clear that the potion was not the cure-all many thought it to be.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/world/africa/29potion.html Crowds Come Over Roads and by Helicopters for Tanzanian’s Cure-All Potion,''The New York Times'', March 28, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper reports regularly picked up what notable visitor had been to the place, Notables who have visited Rev. Mwasapile include legislators and cabinet ministers locally, and scores of personalities especially from [[East Africa|eastern Africa]], among are cited the wife of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] president [[Joseph Kabila]].

[[File:N06Angerona.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Angerona &lt;br /&gt; statue in the Schönbrunn palace in Vienna &lt;/center&gt;]]
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], '''Angerona''' or '''Angeronia''' was an old Roman goddess, whose name and functions are variously explained. She is sometimes identified with the goddess [[Feronia (mythology)|Feronia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==History==
According to ancient authorities, she was a goddess who relieved men from pain and sorrow, or delivered the Romans and their flocks from ''angina'' ([[Peritonsillar abscess|quinsy]]).  Also she was a protecting goddess of Rome and the keeper of the sacred name of the city, which might not be pronounced lest it should be revealed to her enemies.  It was even thought that Angerona itself was this name;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} a late antique source suggests it was Amor, ''i.e.'' Roma inverted.  Sorania and Hirpa have also been put forward as candidates for the secret name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=LaBadie Jr. |first1=Horace W. |title=What was the secret name of Rome? |url=http://hwlabadiejr.tripod.com/roma.htm |accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars regard her as a goddess akin to [[Ops]], [[Acca Larentia]], and [[Dea Dia]]; or as the goddess of the new year and the returning sun (according to Mommsen, ''ab angerendo'' = ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀναφέρεσθαι τὸν ἥλιον). Her festival, called [[Divalia]] or [[Angeronalia]], was celebrated on 21 December. The priests offered sacrifice in the temple of [[Volupia]], the goddess of pleasure, in which stood a statue of Angerona, with a finger on her mouth, which was bound and closed ([[Macrobius]] i. 10; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Nat. Hist.'' iii. 9; [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], ''L. L.'' vi. 23). She was worshipped as Ancharia at [[Faesulae]], where an altar belonging to her was discovered in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In art, she was depicted with a bandaged mouth and a finger pressed to her lips, demanding silence.&lt;ref&gt;Statue of Angerona. Bronze.662 ([http://medaillesetantiques.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/c33gbf19z http://medaillesetantiques.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/c33gbf19z]), [[Honoré Théodoric d'Albert de Luynes|de Luynes]] collection, BnF&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[Georges Dumézil]]&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil 1977 p. 296-299.&lt;/ref&gt; considers Angerona as the goddess who helps nature and men to sustain successfully the yearly crisis of the winter days. These culminate in the winter solstice, the shortest day, which in Latin is known as ''bruma'', from ''brevissima (dies)'', the shortest day. The embarrassment, pain and anguish caused by the lack of light and the cold are expressed by the word  ''angor''. In Latin the cognate word ''angustiae'' designates a space of time considered as disgracefully and painfully too short.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil cites Macrobius in describing the turn in the year in ''Saturnalia'' I 25, 15: "the time when the light is ''angusta''...; the solstice, day in which the sun rises finally ''ex latebris angustiisque''..." and Ovid ''Tristia'' V 10, 7-8: "The summer solstice does not make my nights short, and the winter solstice does not make days ''angustos''".&lt;/ref&gt;
Angerona and the connected cult guaranteed the overcoming of the unpleasant ''angusti dies'' narrow, short days.

Dumézil considered the Roman goddesses whose name ends with the suffix ''-ona'' or ''-onia'' to discharge the function of helping worshippers to overcome a particular time or condition of crisis: instances include [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]] who allows the Roman to wade across war in the best way possible, [[Orbona]] who cares for parents who lost a child,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Natura Deorum'' III 63; Arnobius ''Adversus Gentiles'' IV 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pellonia_(deity)|Pellonia]] who pushes the enemies away,&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus Gentiles'' IV 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fessonia]] who permits travellers to subdue fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine ''De Civitate Dei'' IV 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angerona's ''feriae'' named ''Angeronalia'' or ''Divalia'' took place on December 21, the same day as the winter solstice. On that day the pontiffs offer a sacrifice to the goddess ''in curia Acculeia'' according to Varro&lt;ref&gt;Varro  ''De Lingua Latina'' VI 23.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''in sacello Volupiae'', near the ''Porta Romanula'', one of the inner gates on the northern side of the Palatine.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 10, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In her shrine on the altar of Volupia&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' I 10, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; was placed the famous statue of the Angerona with her mouth bandaged and sealed and with a finger on the lips in the gesture that requests silence.&lt;ref&gt;Solinus ''De Mirabilibus Mundi'' I 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil sees in this peculiar feature the reason of her being listed among the goddesses who were considered candidates to the title of secret tutelary deity  of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' III 8, 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil considers this peculiar feature of Angerona's statue to hint to a  prerogative of the goddess which was well known to the Romans, i.e. her will of requesting silence. He remarks silence in a time of cosmic crisis is a well documented point in other religions, giving two instances from Scandinavian and Vedic religion.

Among the Scandinavians god [[Viðarr]] is considered the second strongest after [[Thor]]. His only known act is placed at the time of the "[[Dusk of the gods]]", the great crisis in which the old world disappears, as the wolf [[Fenrir]] swallows [[Oðinn]] and the sun.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Völuspa]]'' 53; ''Edda Snorra Sturlusonar ([[Snorri's Edda]])'' p. 73 F. Jónsson 1931 as cited by Dumézil 1977 p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;  Then Viðarr defeats Fenrir permitting the rebirth of the world with a female sun, the daughter of the disappeared one. The eschatological crisis in which Fenrir devours the sun is seen as the "Great Winter" ''[[Fimbulvetr]]'' and the god who kills Fenrir, Viðarr, is defined the "silent Ase":&lt;ref&gt;''Edda Snorra Sturlusonar'' p. 33 as cited by Dumézil 1977 p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; silence must be associated with his exceptional force and his feat as saviour of the world. Angerona too discharges the function of saving the sun in danger thanks to her silence and the concentration of mystical force it brings.

In Vedic religion silence is used in another crisis of the sun, that of the eclipse: when the sun was hidden in the demonic dark, [[Atri]] took it away from there by means of the fourth ''[[bráhman]]'' and a cult to the gods through "nude worship", i.e. with a force from within and no uttered words.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''Déesses latines et mythes védiques'' Paris 1956 pp.55-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The association between Angerona and Volupia would thence be explained as the pleasure that derives from a fulfilled desire, the achievement of an objective, as the meaning of the archaic adjective ''volup(e)'' does not refer to pleasure in the sense of the later word ''voluptas''. Thence the definition of θεός της βουλης και καιρων "goddess of advice and of favourable occasions" given in a Latin-Greek glossary.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil ''Déesses latines et mythes védiques'' Paris 1956 pp. 66-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Children's Global Assessment Scale''' ('''CGAS''') is a numeric scale used by mental health clinicians to rate the general functioning of youths under the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaffer|first=David|last2=Gould|first2=M.S.|last3=Brasic|first3=J.|last4=Ambrosini|first4=P.|last5=Fisher|first5=Prudence|last6=Bird|first6=Hector|last7=Aluwahlia|first7=S.|year=1983|title=A children's global assessment scale (CGAS)|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=40|pages=1228–31|pmid=6639293|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1983.01790100074010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scores range from 1 to 90 or 1 to 100, with high scores indicating better functioning. Some versions omit the range from 91-100, as scores in this range would mean "superior functioning"—which rarely would be seen among people seeking health services.

==Application==
Ratings on a CGAS scale should be independent of specific mental health diagnoses.  The scale is presented and described Shaffer D, Gould MS, Brasic J, et al. (1983) A children's global assessment scale (CGAS).  Archives of General Psychiatry, 40, 1228-1231.  Adults are evaluated on the Global Assessment Scale (GAS), which was revised to the [[Global Assessment of Functioning]] (GAF) included as Axis V in the multiaxial system of [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]].

==Score interpretation==
'''100–91'''  Superior functioning in all areas (at home, at school, and with peers); involved in
a wide range of activities and has many interests (e.g., has hobbies or
participates in extracurricular activities or belongs to an organized group such as
Scouts, etc.); likeable, confident; ‘everyday’ worries never get out of hand; doing
well in school; no symptoms.

'''90–81''' Good functioning in all areas; secure in family, school, and with peers; there may
be transient difficulties and ‘everyday’ worries that occasionally get out of hand
(e.g., mild anxiety associated with an important exam, occasional ‘blowups’ with
siblings, parents or peers).

'''80–71''' No more than slight impairments in functioning at home, at school, or with peers;
some disturbance of behavior or emotional distress may be present in response
to life stresses (e.g., parental separations, deaths, birth of a sibling), but these are
brief and interference with functioning is transient; such children are only
minimally disturbing to others and are not considered deviant by those who know
them.

'''70–61''' Some difficulty in a single area but generally functioning well (e.g., sporadic
or isolated antisocial acts, such as occasionally playing hooky or petty theft;
consistent minor difficulties with school work; mood changes of brief duration;
fears and anxieties which do not lead to gross avoidance behaviour; self-doubts);
has some meaningful interpersonal relationships; most people who do not know
the child well would not consider him/her deviant but those who do know him/her
well might express concern.

'''60–51''' Variable functioning with sporadic difficulties or symptoms in several but not all
social areas; disturbance would be apparent to those who encounter the child in
a dysfunctional setting or time but not to those who see the child in other
settings.

'''50–41''' Moderate degree of interference in functioning in most social areas or severe
impairment of functioning in one area, such as might result from, for example,
suicidal preoccupations and ruminations, school refusal and other forms of
anxiety, obsessive rituals, major conversion symptoms, frequent anxiety attacks,
poor to inappropriate social skills, frequent episodes of aggressive or other
antisocial behaviour with some preservation of meaningful social relationships.

'''40–31''' Major impairment of functioning in several areas and unable to function in one of
these areas i.e., disturbed at home, at school, with peers, or in society at large,
e.g., persistent aggression without clear instigation; markedly withdrawn and
isolated behaviour due to either mood or thought disturbance, suicidal attempts
with clear lethal intent; such children are likely to require special schooling and/or
hospitalisation or withdrawal from school (but this is not a sufficient criterion for
inclusion in this category).

'''30–21''' Unable to function in almost all areas e.g., stays at home, in ward, or in bed all
day without taking part in social activities or severe impairment in reality testing
or serious impairment in communication (e.g., sometimes incoherent or
inappropriate).

'''20–11''' Needs considerable supervision to prevent hurting others or self (e.g., frequently
violent, repeated suicide attempts) or to maintain personal hygiene or gross
impairment in all forms of communication, e.g., severe abnormalities in verbal and
gestural communication, marked social aloofness, stupor, etc.

'''10–1''' Needs constant supervision (24-hour care) due to severely aggressive or self-destructive
behaviour or gross impairment in reality testing, communication,
cognition, affect or personal hygiene.

Medical Director is the most widely used electronic medical record system by Australian primary health care providers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

DOCLE has been modelled on the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] biological classification system since 1995.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.docle.com.au/publ/Hic99.htm|title=Ian Wilson wrote:|website=docle.com.au|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; DOCLE generates clinical codes from ubiquitous health language using an algorithm, hence it is a human readable clinical coding system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The design principles of DOCLE, as enumerated by the author in the DOCLE website include:
* DOCLE codes being meaningful and intentional
* DOCLE codes are derived from ubiquitous health language
* DOCLE codes grew with evolving order and speciation of large scale structures in a linnean manner.
* DOCLE codes are designed to strap together and form clinical structures using joiner codes
* The author of DOCLE, Dr. Y Kuang Oon, has likened clinical codes to "neurons" and joiner codes as the "glia"

The '''disability-adjusted life year''' ('''DALY''') is a measure of overall [[disease burden]], expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.  It was developed in the 1990s as a way of comparing the overall health and life expectancy of different countries.

The DALY is becoming increasingly common in the field of [[public health]] and [[Health Impact Assessment|health impact assessment]] (HIA). It "extends the concept of potential years of life lost due to premature [[death]]... to include equivalent years of 'healthy' life lost by virtue of being in states of poor health or [[disability]]."&lt;ref name=WHO2004&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/entity/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/gbddeathdalycountryestimates2004.xls |title=Death and DALY estimates for 2004 by cause for WHO Member States: Persons, all ages |format=xls |work=World Health Organization |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-11-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61CAEElzK?url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/gbddeathdalycountryestimates2004.xls |archivedate=2011-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, [[death|mortality]] and [[morbidity]] are combined into a single, common metric.

== Calculation ==
[[File:DALY disability affected life year infographic.svg|center|750px|adjusted life year]]
The disability-adjusted life year is a societal measure of the [[Disease burden|disease or disability burden]] in populations.  DALYs are calculated by combining measures of [[life expectancy]] as well as the adjusted quality of life during a burdensome disease or disability for a population.  DALYs are related to the [[quality-adjusted life year]] (QALY) measure; however QALYs only measure the benefit with and without medical intervention and therefore do not measure the total burden.  Also, QALYs tend to be an individual measure, and not a societal measure.

Traditionally, health liabilities were expressed using one measure, the [[Years of potential life lost|years of life lost]] (YLL) due to dying early.  A medical condition that did not result in dying younger than expected was not counted.  The [[years lost due to disability]] (YLD) component measures the burden of living with a disease or disability.

DALYs are calculated by taking the sum of these two components:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Arie  | last = Havelaar | title = Methodological choices for calculating the disease burden and cost-of-illness of foodborne zoonoses in European countries | version = | publisher = [[Med-Vet-Net]] | date = August 2007 | url = http://www.medvetnet.org/pdf/Reports/Report_07-002.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-04-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121024116/http://www.medvetnet.org/pdf/Reports/Report_07-002.pdf|archivedate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''DALY = YLL + YLD'''

The DALY relies on an acceptance that the most appropriate measure of the effects of chronic illness is time, both time lost due to premature death and time spent disabled by disease. One DALY, therefore, is equal to one year of healthy life lost.

How much a medical condition affects a person is called the ''disability weight'' (DW).  This is determined by disease or disability and does not vary with age. Tables have been created of thousands of diseases and disabilities, ranging from Alzheimer's disease to loss of finger, with the disability weight meant to indicate the level of disability that results from the specific condition.

Examples of the disability weight are shown on the right. Some of these are "short term" and the long-term weights may be different.

The most noticeable change between the 2004 and 2010 figures for disability weights above are for blindness as it was considered the weights are a measure of health rather than wellbeing (or welfare) and a blind person is not considered to be ill. "In the {{abbr |GBD| Global Burden of Disease }} terminology, the term disability is used broadly to refer to departures from optimal health in any of the important domains of health."{{sfn|WHO|2013|p=15}}

At the population level, the disease burden as measured by DALYs is calculated by adding YLL to YLD. YLL uses the life expectancy at the time of death. YLD is determined by the number of years disabled weighted by level of disability caused by a disability or disease using the formula:
:'''YLD = I x DW x L'''
In this formula I = number of incident cases in the population, DW = disability weight of specific condition, and L = average duration of the case until remission or death (years). There is also a prevalence (as opposed to incidence) based calculation for YLD. Number of years lost due to premature death is calculated by 
:'''YLL = N x L''' 
where N = number of deaths due to condition, L = standard life expectancy at age of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metrics: Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/metrics_daly/en/|accessdate=29 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025145505/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/metrics_daly/en/|archivedate=25 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Note that life expectancies are not the same at different ages.  For example, in Paleolithic era, life expectancy at birth was 33 year, but life expectancy at the age of 15 was additional 39 years (total 54).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/1520-6505(2000)9:4&lt;156::AID-EVAN5&gt;3.0.CO;2-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japan]]ese [[life expectancy]] statistics are used as the standard for measuring premature death, as the Japanese have the longest life expectancies.&lt;ref name="menken"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Menken M, Munsat TL, Toole JF |title=The global burden of disease study: implications for neurology |journal=Arch.

=== Age weighting ===
[[File:Disability Adjusted Life Year Weight Plot.svg|thumb|right|
Some studies use DALYs calculated to place greater value on a year lived as a young adult. This formula produces average values around age 10 and age 55, a peak around age 25, and lowest values among very young children and very old people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murray|first=Christopher J|title=Quantifying the burden of disease: the technical basis for disability-adjusted life years|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=1994|pmc=2486718|pmid=8062401|volume=72|issue=3|pages=429–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A crucial distinction among DALY studies has been the use of "age-weighting", in which the value of each year of life depends on age; however, the [[World Health Organization]] has abandoned age weighting and time discounting in DALYs since 2010.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title=WHO methods and data sources for global burden of disease estimates 2000–2011|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/GlobalDALYmethods_2000_2011.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2013|accessdate=Jul 27, 2016|ref={{SfnRef|WHO|2013}}|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909074653/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/GlobalDALYmethods_2000_2011.pdf|archivedate=2016-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two components to this differential accounting of time:  age-weighting and time-discounting. Age-weighting is based on the theory of human capital. Commonly, years lived as a young adult are valued more highly than years spent as a young child or older adult, as these are years of peak productivity. Age-weighting receives considerable criticism for valuing young adults at the expense of children and the old. Some criticize, while others rationalize, this as reflecting society's interest in [[productivity]] and receiving a return on its investment in raising children. This age-weighting system means that somebody disabled at 30 years of age, for ten years, would be measured as having a higher loss of DALYs (a greater burden of disease), than somebody disabled by the same disease or injury at the age of 70 for ten years.

This age-weighting function is by no means a universal methodology in {{abbr |HALY| health adjusted life years }} studies, but is common when using DALYs. Cost-effectiveness studies using {{abbr |QALYs| quality adjusted life years }}, for example, do not discount time at different ages differently.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; This age-weighting function applies only to the calculation of DALYs lost due to disability. Years lost to premature death are determined from the age at death and life expectancy.

The [[Global Burden of Disease Study]] (GBD) 2001–2002 counted disability adjusted life years equally for all ages, but the GBD 1990 and GBD 2004 studies used the formula&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/daly_disability_weight/en/index.html|title=Disability weights, discounting and age weighting of DALYs|publisher=WHO|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212032355/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/daly_disability_weight/en/index.html|archivedate=2008-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In these studies future years were also [[discounted]] at a 3% rate to account for future health care losses. [[Time discounting]], which is separate from the age-weighting function, describes preferences in time as used in economic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Alexander|last2=Hossain|first2=Mobarak|last3=Kraas,|first3=Frauke|title=Health in megacities and urban areas|date=2011|publisher=Physica-Verlag|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-7908-2732-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the interplay between life expectancy and years lost, discounting, and social weighting are complex, depending on the severity and duration of illness.  For example, the parameters used in the GBD 1990 study generally give greater weight to deaths at any year prior to age 39 than afterward, with the death of a newborn weighted at 33 DALYs and the death of someone aged 5–20 weighted at approximately 36 DALYs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Lopez AD |title=Measuring the burden of neglected tropical diseases: the global burden of disease framework |journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=e114 |year=2007 |pmid=18060077 |pmc=2100367 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000114 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000114}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of numerous discussions, by 2010 the [[World Health Organization]] had abandoned the ideas of age weighting and time discounting.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; They had also substituted the idea of [[prevalence]] for ''incidence'' (when a condition started) because this is what surveys measure.

== Economic applications ==
The methodology is not an economic measure. It measures how much healthy life is lost.  It does not assign a monetary value to any person or condition, and it does not measure how much productive work or money is lost as a result of death and disease.
However, HALYs, including DALYs and QALYs, are especially useful in guiding the allocation of health resources as they provide a common numerator, allowing for the expression of utility in terms of DALYs/dollar, or QALY/dollar.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gold|first1=MR|last2=Stevenson|first2=D|last3=Fryback|first3=DG|title=HALYS and QALYS and DALYS, oh my: similarities and differences in summary measures of population health|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|date=2002|volume=23|pages=115–34|pmid=11910057|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140513}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Gambia, provision of the [[pneumococcal conjugate vaccine]] costs $670 per DALY saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=SY|last2=Lee|first2=G|last3=Goldie|first3=SJ|title=Economic evaluation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in The Gambia.|journal=BMC Infectious Diseases|date=Sep 3, 2010|volume=10|pages=260|pmid=20815900|doi=10.1186/1471-2334-10-260|pmc=2944347}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This number can then be compared to other treatments for other diseases, to determine whether investing resources in preventing or treating a different disease would be more efficient in terms of overall health.

== History and usage ==
Originally developed by [[Harvard University]] for the [[World Bank]] in 1990, the [[World Health Organization]] subsequently adopted the method in 1996 as part of the Ad hoc Committee on Health Research "Investing in Health Research &amp; Development" report.  The DALY was first conceptualized by Murray and Lopez in work carried out with the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]] known as the [[Global Burden of Disease Study]], which was published in 1990.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} It is now a key measure employed by the [[United Nations]] [[World Health Organization]] in such publications as its ''Global Burden of Disease''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/|title=Global Health Estimates|website=World Health Organization|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831140920/http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/en/|archivedate=2015-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DALY was also used in the 1993 [[World Development Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health |year=1993 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5976 |author=[[World Bank]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127012848/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5976 |archivedate=2016-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|x}}

== Criticism ==
Both [[DALY]]s and [[QALY]]s are forms of [[HALY]]s health adjusted life years.

Although some have criticized DALYs as essentially an economic measure of human [[productive capacity]] for the affected individual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thacker SB, Stroup DF, Carande-Kulis V, Marks JS, Roy K, Gerberding JL |title=Measuring the public's health |journal=Public Health Rep |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=14–22 |year=2006 |pmid=16416694 |pmc=1497799 |doi= 10.1177/003335490612100107|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrelevant citation|date=July 2016|reason=doesn't criticize DALYs for this reason}} this is not so. DALYs do have an age-weighting function that has been rationalized based on the economic productivity of persons at that age, but health-related [[quality of life]] measures are used to determine the disability weights, which range from 0 to 1 (no disability to 100% disabled) for all disease. These weights are based not on a person's ability to work, but rather on the effects of the disability on the person's life in general. This is why mental illness is one of the leading diseases as measured by global burden of disease studies, with depression accounting for 51.84 million DALYs. Perinatal conditions, which affect infants with a very low age-weight function, are the leading cause of lost DALYs at 90.48 million. Measles is fifteenth at 23.11 million.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Alexander, Md.

According to Pliskin et al., the QALY model requires [[utility]] independent, [[risk neutral]], and constant proportional tradeoff behaviour.&lt;ref name=Pliskin1980&gt;{{cite journal |pages=206–24 |doi=10.1287/opre.28.1.206 |jstor=172147 |title=Utility Functions for Life Years and Health Status |year=1980 |last1=Pliskin |first1=J. S. |last2=Shepard |first2=D. S. |last3=Weinstein |first3=M. C. |journal=Operations Research |volume=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these theoretical assumptions, the meaning and usefulness of the QALY is debated.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1477-7525-1-80 |year=2003 |last1=Prieto |first1=Luis |last2=Sacristán |first2=José A |journal=Health and Quality of Life Outcomes |volume=1 |pages=80 |pmid=14687421 |title=Problems and solutions in calculating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) |pmc=317370}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0272989X07309642 |title=Comparing the Incomparable?

Some argue that there are health states worse than being dead, and that therefore there should be negative values possible on the health spectrum (indeed, some health economists have incorporated negative values into calculations). Determining the level of health depends on measures that some argue place disproportionate importance on physical pain or disability over mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dolan |first=P |title=Developing methods that really do value the ‘Q’ in the QALY |journal=Health Economics, Policy and Law |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=69–77 |year=January 2008 |doi=10.1017/S1744133107004355 |url=http://pauldolan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/developing-the-methods-that-really-do-value.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of ranking interventions on grounds of their cost per QALY gained ratio (or [[Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio|ICER]]) is controversial because it implies a quasi-[[utilitarian]] calculus to determine who will or will not receive treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Michael | last = Schlander | title = Measures of efficiency in healthcare: QALMs about QALYs? | publisher =  Institute for Innovation &amp; Valuation in Health Care | date = 2010-05-23 | location = | url = http://www.michaelschlander.com/pnp/publications_en/Schlander-QALMs-about-QALYs-2010.pdf | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its supporters argue that since health care resources are inevitably limited, this method enables them to be allocated in the way that is approximately optimal for society, including most patients.  Another concern is that it does not take into account equity issues such as the overall distribution of health states – particularly since younger, healthier cohorts have many times more QALYs than older or sicker individuals. As a result, QALY analysis may undervalue treatments which benefit
the elderly or others with a lower life expectancy. Also, many would argue that all else being equal, patients with more severe illness should be prioritised over patients with less severe illness if both would get the same absolute increase in utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1050(199902)8:1&lt;25::AID-HEC398&gt;3.0.CO;2-H |title=Incorporating societal concerns for fairness in numerical valuations of health programmes |year=1999 |last1=Nord |first1=Erik |last2=Pinto |first2=Jose Luis |last3=Richardson |first3=Jeff |last4=Menzel |first4=Paul |last5=Ubel |first5=Peter |journal=Health Economics |volume=8 |pages=25–39 |pmid=10082141 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As early as 1989, [[Graham Loomes|Loomes]] and McKenzie recommended that research be conducted concerning the validity of QALYs.&lt;ref name=Loomes1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loomes|first1=Graham|last2=McKenzie|first2=Lynda|title=The use of QALYs in health care decision making|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=28|issue=4| year=1989|pages=299–308|issn=02779536| doi=10.1016/0277-9536(89)90030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, with funding from the [[European Commission]], the European Consortium in Healthcare Outcomes and Cost-Benefit Research (ECHOUTCOME) began a major study on QALYs as used in [[health technology assessment]].&lt;ref name=ECHOUTCOMEhome&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echoutcome.eu|title=ECHOUTCOME: European Consortium in Healthcare Outcomes and Cost-Benefit Research|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008010513/http://echoutcome.eu/|archive-date=2016-10-08 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ariel Beresniak]], the study's lead author, was quoted as saying that it was the "largest-ever study specifically dedicated to testing the assumptions of the QALY."&lt;ref name=Holmes2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holmes |first=David |title=Report triggers quibbles over QALYs, a staple of health metrics |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=248 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23467219 |doi=10.1038/nm0313-248 |url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v19/n3/full/nm0313-248.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, at its final conference, ECHOUTCOME released preliminary results of its study which surveyed 1361 people "from academia" in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK.&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreaper |first=Jane |title=Researchers claim NHS drug decisions 'are flawed' |newspaper=BBC News |date=24 January 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21170445|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beresniak2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beresniak|first1=Ariel|last2=Medina-Lara|first2=Antonieta|last3=Auray|first3=Jean Paul|last4=De Wever|first4=Alain|last5=Praet|first5=Jean-Claude|last6=Tarricone|first6=Rosanna|last7=Torbica|first7=Aleksandra|last8=Dupont|first8=Danielle|last9=Lamure|first9=Michel|last10=Duru|first10=Gerard|title=Validation of the Underlying Assumptions of the Quality-Adjusted Life-Years Outcome: Results from the ECHOUTCOME European Project|journal=PharmacoEconomics|volume=33|issue=1|year=2015|pages=61–69|issn=1170-7690|doi=10.1007/s40273-014-0216-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers asked the subjects to respond to 14 questions concerning their preferences for various health states and durations of those states (e.g., 15 years limping versus 5 years in a wheelchair).&lt;ref name=Beresniak2015/&gt; They concluded that "preferences expressed by the respondents were not consistent with the QALY theoretical assumptions" that quality of life can be measured in consistent intervals, that life-years and quality of life are independent of each other, that people are neutral about risk, and that willingness to gain or lose life-years is constant over time.&lt;ref name=Beresniak2015/&gt; ECHOUTCOME also released "European Guidelines for Cost-Effectiveness Assessments of Health Technologies," which recommended not using QALYs in healthcare decision making.&lt;ref name=ECHOUTCOMEguidelines&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echoutcome.eu/images/Echoutcome__Leaflet_Guidelines___final.pdf|title=European Guidelines for Cost-Effectiveness Assessments of Health Technologies|author=European Consortium in Healthcare Outcomes and Cost-Benefit Research (ECHOUTCOME)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814070546/http://echoutcome.eu/images/Echoutcome__Leaflet_Guidelines___final.pdf|archive-date=2015-08-14 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the guidelines recommended that cost-effectiveness analyses focus on "costs per relevant clinical outcome."&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=ECHOUTCOMEguidelines/&gt;

In response to the ECHOUTCOME study, representatives of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the [[Scottish Medicines Consortium]], and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] made the following points. First, QALYs are better than alternative measures.&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Second, the study was "limited."&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Third, problems with QALYs were already widely acknowledged.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Fourth, the researchers did not take budgetary constraints into consideration.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; Fifth, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence uses QALYs that are based on 3395 interviews with residents of the UK, as opposed to residents of several European countries.&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt; Finally, people who call for the elimination of QALYs may have "[[Conflict of interest|vested interests]]."&lt;ref name=Holmes2013/&gt;

'''Entropy monitoring''' is a method of assessing the effect of certain anaesthetic drugs on the brain's EEG. It was commercially developed by Datex-Ohmeda, which is now part of [[GE Healthcare]].

Entropy is a quantitative EEG device which captures a single-lead frontal EEG via a 3-electrode sensor applied to the patient's forehead. The system relies on a method of assessing the degree of irregularity in [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) signals. The principle is that the irregularity of an EEG signal decreases with increasing brain levels of [[anaesthetic]] drugs and that the entropy is a measure of that irregularity.

Entropy monitors generate two numbers that are derived from different to frequency bands used. The State Entropy (SE) is calculated from the 0.8&amp;nbsp;Hz to 32&amp;nbsp;Hz range, whereas the Response Entropy (RE) uses frequencies up to 47&amp;nbsp;Hz. Electromyogram activity is more predominant in those higher frequencies, and so the Response Entropy may respond more quickly when muscle activity is present.

Published studies show that Entropy values do relate to clinical levels of anaesthetic depth. Most of the commonly-used anaesthetic drugs are detectable by Entropy monitoring, a notable exception being [[nitrous oxide]], in common with BIS monitoring.

Other [[vital signs]] such as [[pulse]], [[heart rate]], [[blood pressure]], and movement are indirect indicators of [[consciousness]], but are unreliable. When these are combined with expired gas analysis of [[inhalational anaesthetic]] agents, an experienced [[anaesthetist]] can be confident a patient is unconscious and not aware of their surroundings. However, the direct measurement of brain activity using a basic [[electroencephalograph|EEG]] is purported to measure effects of anaesthetics more comprehensively.  Unlike the [[Bispectral index|Bispectral Index]] monitor, the algorithm of the Entropy monitor has been fully disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Viertio-Oja|first=H.|last2=Maja|first2=V.|last3=Sarkela|first3=M.|last4=Talja|first4=P.|last5=Tenkanen|first5=N.|last6=Tolvanen-Laakso|first6=H.|last7=Paloheimo|first7=M.|last8=Vakkuri|first8=A.|last9=Yli-Hankala|first9=A.|date=2004-02|title=Description of the Entropy (TM) algorithm as applied in the Datex-Ohmeda S/5 (TM) Entropy Module|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0001-5172.2004.00322.x|journal=Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica|volume=48|issue=2|pages=154–161|doi=10.1111/j.0001-5172.2004.00322.x|issn=0001-5172|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] '''Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997''' (FDAMA) amended the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]].  This act is related to the regulation of food, drugs, devices, and biological products by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]. These changes were made in order to recognize the changes in the way the FDA would be operating in the 21st century. The main focus of this is the acknowledgment in the advancement of technological, trade, and public health complexities.

==History==
Congressman [[Richard Burr]] and Senator [[James M. Jeffords]] were the chairperson sponsors of the Food and Drug Administration Regulatory Modernization Act of 1997 or '''Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HR01411: |title=H.R.1411: Food and Drug Administration Regulatory Modernization Act of 1997 |author=105th U.S. Congress |date=April 23, 1997 |work=U.S. House of Representative Bill Summary &amp; Status |publisher=Library of Congress THOMAS |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. legislation was signed by [[Bill Clinton]] on 21 November 1997,&lt;ref name="Clinton1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=53607|title=Statement on Signing the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 |last=Clinton|first=William J.|date=21 November 1997|work=The American Presidency Project|publisher=John T.

==Provisions==
The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 was a piece of legislation that concentrated on reforming the regulation of food, medical products, and cosmetics in the United States. The following are the most significant provisions of the act:

;Prescription drug user fees
The act reauthorized, for five more years, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA). The purpose of this was to enable the FDA to reduce the average time required for a drug review from 30 months to 15 months.

;FDA initiatives and programs
The law enacts many FDA initiatives undertaken in recent years under Vice President Al Gore's Reinventing Government program. The codified initiatives include measures to modernize the regulation of biological products by bringing them in harmony with the regulations for drugs and eliminating the need for establishment license application; eliminate the batch certification and monograph requirements for insulin and antibiotics; streamline the approval processes for drug and biological manufacturing changes; and reduce the need for environmental assessment as part of a product application.

The act also codifies FDA regulations and practice to increase patient access to experimental drugs and medical devices and to accelerate review of important new medications. In addition, the law provides for an expanded database on clinical trials, which will be accessible by patients. With the sponsor's consent, the results of such clinical trials will be included in the database. Under a separate provision, patients will receive advance notice when a manufacturer plans to discontinue a drug on which they depend for life support or sustenance, or for a treatment of a serious or debilitating disease or condition.

;Information on off-label use and drug economics
The law abolishes the long-standing prohibition of broadcasting by manufacturers of information about unapproved uses of drugs and medical devices. The act allows a firm to circulate peer-reviewed journal articles about an off-label indication of its product, providing the company is also committing itself to file proof of research within a certain amount of time.

The act also allows drug companies to provide economic information about their products to formulary committees, managed care organizations, and similar large-scale buyers of health-care products. The provision is intended to provide such entities with dependable facts about the economic consequences of their procurement decisions. The law, however, does not permit the spreading of economic information that could affect prescribing choices to individual medical practitioners.

;Pharmacy compounding
The act creates a special exemption to ensure continued availability of compounded drug products prepared by pharmacists to provide patients with individualized therapies not available commercially. The law, however, seeks to prevent manufacturing under the guise of compounding by establishing parameters within which the practice is appropriate and lawful.

;Risk-based regulation of medical devices
The act complements and builds on the FDA's recent measures to focus its resources on medical devices that present the greatest risks to patients. For example, the law exempts from premarket notification, class I devices that are not intended for a use that is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or that do not present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The law also directs the FDA to focus its post market surveillance on higher risk devices, and allows the agency to implement a reporting system that concentrates on a representative sample of user facilities—such as hospitals and nursing homes—that experience deaths and serious illnesses or injuries linked with the use of devices.

Finally, the law expands an ongoing pilot program under which the FDA accredits outside—so-called "third party"—experts to conduct the initial review of all low-to-intermediate risk class I and II devices. The act, however, specifies that an accredited person may not review devices that are permanently implantable, life-supporting, life sustaining, or for which clinical data are required.

;Food safety and labeling
The act eliminates the requirement of the FDA's premarket approval for most packaging and other substances that come in contact with food and may migrate into it. Instead, the law establishes a process whereby the manufacturer can notify the agency of its intent to use certain food contact substances and, unless the FDA objects within 120 days, the manufacturer may proceed with the marketing of the new product. Implementation of the notification process is contingent on additional appropriations to cover its cost to the agency. The act also expands procedures under which the FDA can authorize health claims and nutrient content claims without reducing the statutory standard.

;Standards for medical products

While the act reduces or simplifies many regulatory obligations of manufacturers, it does not lower the standards by which medical products are introduced into the market place. In the area of drugs, the law codifies the agency's current practice of allowing in certain circumstances one clinical investigation as the basis for product approval. The act, however, does preserve the presumption that, as a general rule, two adequate and well-controlled studies are needed to prove the product's safety and effectiveness.

In the area of medical devices, the act specifies that the FDA may keep out of the market products whose manufacturing processes are so deficient that they could present a serious health hazard. The law also gives the agency authority to take appropriate action if the technology of a device suggests that it is likely to be used for a potentially harmful unlabeled use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=|title=Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/laws/PL105_115.asp|publisher=The National Academies|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA Backgrounder on FDAMA"&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Backgrounder on FDAMA|url=http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/FederalFoodDrugandCosmeticActFDCAct/SignificantAmendmentstotheFDCAct/FDAMA/ucm089179.htm|publisher=FDA|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Prescription Drug User Fee Act]]
The FDAMA required all of these specifications, in addition many of these provisions were required to completed in a specific time period. These are specified in the FDAMA Implementation Chart of Completed Items.

==Controversies==
The biggest complaint in regards to this act was the amount of time, money, and effort it would require. This act required the government to make good on a lot of its promises within the FDA.
On October 7, 1998, the Acting Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Michael A. Friedman, M.D., said this in regards to the acts implementation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Coming at this time of vigorous scientific growth, implementing FDAMA is one of the most demanding challenges faced by the Agency in its 92 year history. It has been a challenge, albeit one I believe we have substantially met, to promulgate the many regulations and guidances, and take the other steps, necessary to effectuate the changes set forth in the statute. We are thoroughly committed to meeting this challenge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics questioned the necessity of the act, stating that the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was a substantial legislature on its own. In addition, many questioned whether the shortened time frame for the approval of prescription drugs would do more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman, M.D.|first=Michael A.|title=Testimony on the Implementation of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997|url=https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t981007a.html|publisher=Assistant Secretary For Legislation|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">'''Generalization''' is the concept that humans and animals use past learning in present situations of learning if the conditions in the situations are regarded as similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gluck|first1=Mark A.|last2=Mercado|first2=Eduardo|last3=Myers|first3=Catherine E.|title=Learning and memory : from brain to behavior|date=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781429240147|page=209|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a person has learned in the past that every time they eat an apple, their throat becomes itchy and swollen, they might assume they are allergic to all fruit. When this person is offered a banana to eat, they reject it upon assuming they are also allergic to it through generalizing that all fruits cause the same reaction. Although this generalization about being allergic to all fruit based on experiences with one fruit could be correct in some cases, it may not be correct in all. Both positive and negative effects have been shown in education through learned generalization and its contrasting notion of [[discrimination learning]].

Generalization is understood to be directly tied to the [[Transfer of learning|transfer]] of [[knowledge]] across multiple situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=J. E.|last2=Shea|first2=T. M.|last3=Bauer|first3=A.M.|title=Generalization and the Effects of Consequences {{!}} Education.com|url=http://www.education.com/reference/article/generalization-effects-consequences/|website=www.education.com|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generalization allows humans and animals to recognize the similarities in knowledge acquired in one circumstance, allowing for transfer of knowledge onto new situations. This idea rivals the theory of [[situated cognition]], instead stating that one can apply past knowledge to learning in new situations and environments.

Generalization is shown to have implications on the use of the [[spacing effect]] in educational settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vlach|first1=Haley A.|title=The Spacing Effect in Children's Generalization of Knowledge: Allowing Children Time to Forget Promotes Their Ability to Learn|journal=Child Development Perspectives|date=September 2014|volume=8|issue=3|pages=163–168|doi=10.1111/cdep.12079}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, it was thought that the information forgotten between periods of learning when implementing [[spaced presentation]] inhibited generalization. In more recent years, this forgetting has been seen as promoting generalization through repetition of information during each occasion of spaced learning. The effects of gaining [[Long-term memory|long-term]] generalization knowledge through spaced learning can be compared with that of massed learning (lengthy and all at once; for example, cramming the night before an exam)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gluck|first1=Mark A.|last2=Mercado|first2=Eduardo|last3=Myers|first3=Catherine E.|title=Learning and memory : from brain to behavior|date=2014|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781429240147|page=312|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a person only gains [[Short-term memory|short-term]] knowledge, decreasing the likelihood of establishing generalization.

A specific type of generalization, fear generalization, occurs when a person associates fears learned in the past through [[classical conditioning]] to similar situations, events, people, and objects in their present. When fear generalization becomes [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]] it is connected to many [[anxiety disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dymond|first1=Simon|last2=Dunsmoor|first2=Joseph E.|last3=Vervliet|first3=Bram|last4=Roche|first4=Bryan|last5=Hermans|first5=Dirk|title=Fear Generalization in Humans: Systematic Review and Implications for Anxiety Disorder Research|journal=Behavior Therapy|date=September 2015|volume=46|issue=5|pages=561–582|doi=10.1016/j.beth.2014.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This maladaptation is often referred to as the overgeneralization of fear and can also lead to the development of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Besnard|first1=Antoine|last2=Sahay|first2=Amar|title=Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis, Fear Generalization, and Stress|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=12 June 2015|volume=41|issue=1|pages=24–44|doi=10.1038/npp.2015.167|pmid=26068726|pmc=4677119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generalization has been shown to be refined and/or stabilized after sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14534586|year=2003|last1=Fenn|first1=KM|last2=Nusbaum|first2=HC|last3=Margoliash|first3=D|title=Consolidation during sleep of perceptual learning of spoken language|volume=425|issue=6958|pages=614–6|doi=10.1038/nature01951|journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In scientific studies looking at generalization, a generalization gradient is often used. This tool is used to measure how often and how much animals or humans respond to certain stimuli, depending on whether the stimuli are similar or different. For example, when measuring responses to color, it is expected that subjects will respond to colors similar to each other, like shades of pink after being exposed to red, as opposed to a non-similar shade of blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gluck|first1=Mark A.|last2=Mercado|first2=Eduardo|last3=Myers|first3=Catherine E.|title=Learning and memory : from brain to behavior|date=2014|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781429240147|page=212|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Spear fishing Peru.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A successful gigger in the [[Amazon basin]], [[Peru]].]]
'''Gigging''' is the practice of hunting fish or small game with a [[Trident|gig]] or similar multi-pronged [[spear]]. Commonly harvested wildlife include freshwater [[Catostomidae|suckers]], saltwater [[flounder]], and small game, such as [[frogs]]. A gig can refer to any long pole which has been tipped with a multi-pronged spear. The gig pole ranges in length from 8 to 14 feet for fish gigs and 5 to 8 feet for frog gigs. A gig typically has three or four barbed [[Tine (structural)|tines]] similar to a [[trident]]; however gigs can be made with any number of tines. In the past people would attach illuminated pine knots to the end of gigs at night to give them light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=451192| title=A Fifth Ozark Word List | last=Randolph | first=Vance |author2=Nancy Clemens | journal=American Speech |date=December 1936 | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=314–318 | doi=10.2307/451192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sucker gigging ==

[[Catostomidae|Suckers]] are a [[bottom feeder|bottom-feeding]] fish common throughout many parts of the US. The gigging of suckers for food occurs predominately in southern [[Missouri]] and northern [[Arkansas]], in the region referred to as the [[Ozarks]]. Sucker gigging is usually done at night with lights to maximize the visibility of the fast moving fish. [[Ozarks]] residents of the past often waded the clear local streams at night and gigged suckers while using light from hand-held [[lanterns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2002/12/10.htm |title=Fish Gigging &amp;#124; MDC |publisher=Mdc.mo.gov |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2012-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527151201/http://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2002/12/10.htm |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sucker gigging uses specially constructed [[jon boat]]s that have a set of lights mounted on the [[Bow (ship)|bow]] of the boat and a railing around the bow that allows the "gigger" to stand up and peer out in front of the boat in an attempt to locate and gig fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nighthawkpublications.com/journal/journal170-1.htm |title=John's Journal |publisher=Night Hawk Publications |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lighting system is often powered by [[Gas mantle|gas]], a [[Engine-generator|generator]], or a [[Car battery|battery]]. 
[[File:Aalstecher.JPG|thumb|Fish gig inside a museum]]

Species such as ''[[White sucker|Catostomus commersonii]]'' and ''[[Northern hogsucker|Hypentelium nigricans]]'' are commonly sought for eating. They can be canned or smoked, but are most commonly fried. Traditionally, small incisions are made in the flesh (termed "scoring") before frying to allow small internal bones to soften and become palatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nighthawkpublications.com/journal/journal170-4.htm |title=John's Journal |publisher=Night Hawk Publications |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flounder gigging==
[[Image:Pseudopleuronectes americanus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Winter flounder]]]]
[[Flounder]] or [[flatfish]] live in [[coastal]] [[Seawater|saltwater]] areas, and lie at the bottom of the shallow waters waiting for [[shrimp]] or [[minnow]]s to swim nearby. Flounder gigging can be done in daylight, but is often more successful done at night using powerful lights. This method targets nocturnally foraging fish. The light is used to spot the normally [[camouflaged]] fish. Historically hollow [[bamboo]] poles filled with coal were used for lighting, and more recently kerosene lamps. Modern lights usually use [[halogen lamp|halogen]] or [[LED]] lamps. This method is effective in shallow, clear water where fish are easily observable from the top. The temporarily blind fish are speared with the gig, or sometimes can be collected by hand. During fishing events, an experienced person holds a lamp in the hand and points out fish for other people to collect.

Flounder gigging can be done by wading stealthily in shallow water, but it is usually done from a flounder boat. A flounder boat is specifically designed for gigging flounder. It typically has a flat, wide bottom to provide a stable platform and the ability to negotiate shallow waters.  Flounder vessels are navigated with a push-pole along the banks and flats where flounder may be lying.  A battery powers light arrays for viewing the flat fish.

==Frog gigging==
[[File:Frog caught on homemade frog gig cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[American bullfrog]] caught at night by a [[pond]] in the [[Southern United States]] on a simple homemade frog gig constructed out of wood and [[Nail (fastener)|nails]].]]
[[File:Frog gig hitting water.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Frog gigging at night by a pond using a [[flashlight]] and a homemade frog gig.]]

Frog gigging is commonly done at night, but it can be done during the day as well. Traditionally, [[flashlight]]s or spotlights are used to locate the frogs as their eyes reflect the light at night. In addition to help the locating of frogs, shining a light in their eyes stuns or dazes the frogs, and makes it less likely for the frog to see an approaching hunter, or the incoming gig itself. A four or five-tined gig is often preferred for frog gigging, as they are normally wider giving the frog gigger more room for error when thrusting the gig at a frog. Frog gigs however, traditionally have smaller tines and are generally smaller overall than gigs used for fish. A fishing license is required in most states and jurisdictions. Frog gigging regulations are usually found in each state's hunting and fishing regulations.

Frogs are often sought for the meat of their hind legs. [[Frog legs]] are often cooked [[Deep frying|deep fried]] or [[Sautéeing|sautéed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cdkitchen.com/recipes/ingredient/seafood/frog-legs/ | title=Frog Legs | work=CDKitchen | accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In proportion, the hind legs can contain as much meat as the legs of a medium-sized chicken. Traditionally they are breaded with a mixture of egg and bread or cracker crumbs. The most popular recipe of frog legs is cooking frog legs in French style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frog Gigging: Equipment, Instruction, Frog Leg Recipe &amp; More |url=https://bullyusa.com/frog-gigging.html |date= October 2018 |publisher=BullyUSA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frog legs are cleaned, breaded with flour and boiled in melted butter. This dish is served immediately with garlic-parsley sauce.

Although capturing frogs with a net or clasp pole may be referred to as frog gigging by some, this is incorrect, as a gig is not being used. Handling frogs with the objective of releasing them may harm the creature because some chemicals present on human skin can easily be absorbed by the frog's skin.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The practice of gigging frogs has been famously referenced in college football. [[Texas A&amp;M University]] uses the cry “Gig ‘em Aggies” which debuted as a rally cry against Texas Christian University (whose mascot is the Horned Frogs), and the phrase has stuck to all of Texas A&amp;M sports and beyond.

==Other fish==
Gigging may also be used to harvest a variety of non-game fish species in numerous states. In Oklahoma, the gamefish [[white bass]] may also be taken by gig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Io fluvialis |url=http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/regulations/nongame.asp |title=Virginia Freshwater Fishing Regulations: Nongame Fish, Reptile, Amphibian and Aquatic Invertebrate Regulations |publisher=Dgif.virginia.gov |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2012-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111164423/http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/regulations/nongame.asp |archivedate=2010-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvwildlife.com/fishing.cfm |title=West Virginia Gun Hunting and Fishing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7677">A [[health care]] crisis currently exists in [[Libya]] due to the ongoing conflict.
== History ==

There has been a crisis in the health system in [[Libya]] in the past six years following the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Revolution]] in 2011. Prior to the Libyan Revolution health training, [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], [[education]], housing, family issues, disability and old-age benefits were all regulated by “Decision No. 111” (dated December 9, 1999) of the General People's Committee on the Promulgation of the By-Law Enforcement Law No. 20 of 1998 on the Social Care Fund. The health care system is not purely state-run; there are very small private hospitals in some areas. In comparison to other states in the [[Middle East]], the health status of the population is above average. Childhood [[immunization]] is almost universal. The [[Potable water|clean water]] supply has increased and sanitation has been improved. The country's major hospitals are in [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/libya.health.htm|title=Libya: Health|work=LookLex Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Libya's population in 2015 was 6.3 million which means that the population has increased by 32.6% in the past 25 years. Among this population 17.1% are between 15 to 24 years (2015) and for this age group the literacy rate is 99.9% while it is 89.9% for adult males and 83.7% for adult females, the life expectancy is 75 years (2012). "The out-of-pocket expenditure share is 29.7% (2013) and the health workforce density (2009) is 19.0 physicians and 68.0 nurses and midwives per 10 000 population".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/254933/1/EMROPUB_2017_EN_19620.pdf|title=Health profile 2015: Libya|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

The history of medical education in&amp;nbsp;[[Libya]]&amp;nbsp;spans over a period of 40 years. Medical schools had a good and promising start in the 1970s. With the discovery of oil in the early 1960s, a good number of students were sponsored by the Libyan government to study medicine in many European and North American universities. This led to the establishment of the first generation of Libyan doctors and academics who founded the first medical school in Benghazi in 1970 and a second one was established in Tripoli in 1973. [[Al-Arab Medical University]] was found in 1984 as the result of a merge of the medical school in Benghazi with other health-related schools. The same applies to [[University of Tripoli]] (University of Al-Fateh for Medical Science) and that was in 1986. This newborn medical education system adopted the British system as its curriculum and English was the language of instructions.

In the period between 1987 and 2001 there was an increase in the number of medical schools in the country and 7 new schools were established in [[Sebha]], Surt, [[Misurata University|Misurata]], [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawia]], Khums, [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]] and [[Gharyan|Ghayran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01421590902832988|title=Medical education in Libya: The challenges|date=1 January 2009|publisher=|journal=Medical Teacher|volume=31|issue=6|pages=493–496||doi=10.1080/01421590902832988|author1=Hani T. S. Benamer|author2=Omran Bakoush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The health sector before and after the 2011 upraise ==
A Ministry of Health report stated that Libya has 96 hospitals, 25 specialized units, 1355 basic health centers, 37 polyclinics and 17 quarantine units and in February 2009 there were 10230 doctors (17/10 000 population), 84% of them were nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hac/crises/lby/libya_crisis_update_16aug11.pdf|title=Libya crisis August 2011 update|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Libyan authorities has largely invested in health services in the three decades up to 2011, which reflected positively in the population's health indicators, some significant challenges remained, most notably:
* &amp;nbsp;the scarcity of national health information led to inaccurate health indicators regarding the causes of [[mortality rate|mortality]] and [[morbidity]]. 
* the highest incidence of [[HIV/AIDS]] among intravenous drug users in the world. 
* a shift in the burden of disease over the past 20 years towards [[noncommunicable diseases]] (NCDs).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other major setbacks in the country's health system included:
* Big proportion of the health workers were foreigners, especially in the southern part of the country.
* Poorly functioning [[Primary healthcare|primary health-care]] (PCH) network, particularly in the main cities (Benghazi and Tripoli).
* Many Libyan were sent for treatment abroad which consumed a substantial proportion of the country's health expenditures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Since the beginning of the 2011 conflict, the Libyan health system has been adversely affected. Many factors impose serious challenges to the public health sector such as the insufficiency of health information system, severe medical supply shortage, and loss of the health staff.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Health services are becoming progressively unavailable. For example, Al Zahra Kidney Hospital near Tripoli was severely damaged and looted during April 2015 clashes. Many hospitals in Benghazi were forced to close because of security concerns. In the meanwhile Benghazi Medical Center&amp;nbsp;(BMC) became the primary hospital for provision of health care in the city of Benghazi. The country is facing severe shortage of medications, medical supplies, and vaccinations which is basically caused by the lack of security and the interrupted supplies delivery. Among the shortage list are chronic disease medications like [[insulin]], anti-[[tuberculosis]], anti-neoplastic, and HIV/AIDS medications as well as laboratory reagents,&amp;nbsp;obstetric and renal dialysis supplies and intravenous fluids. Surgical theaters are suffering from the insufficiency of anesthetics, dressing materials, and internal fixators for fractures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The country is witnessing a wave of internal displacement, it is estimated that the total number of [[IDPs]] in Libya is 435 000 according to [[OCHA]] although the actual scale of this situation and the humanitarian needs of displaced persons is not clear. Most of the IDPs were forced to be displaced more than once and they are scattered around 35 towns and cities. The local authorities and [[nongovernmental organizations]](NGOs) state that the displaced population in lacking water, food, shelter, health care and other basic commodities. On the other hand the hosting cities and town are also facing significant pressure. Since June 2014 the food, fuel, water, medical supplies and electricity shortage has worsened.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Immunodeficiency 26''' is a rare genetic syndrome. It is characterised by absent circulating [[B cell|B]] and [[T cell]]s and normal [[natural killer cell]]s.

==Clinical==

The features of this condition include recurrent candidiasis and lower respiratory tract infections.&lt;ref name=&gt;Mathieu AL, Verronese E, Rice GI, Fouyssac F, Bertrand Y, Picard C, Chansel M, Walter JE, Notarangelo LD, Butte MJ, Nadeau KC, Csomos K, Chen DJ, Chen K, Delgado A, Rigal C, Bardin C, Schuetz C, Moshous D, Reumaux H, Plenat F, Phan A, Zabot MT, Balme B, Viel S, Bienvenu J, Cochat P, van der Burg M, Caux C, Kemp EH, Rouvet I, Malcus C, Méritet JF, Lim A, Crow YJ, Fabien N, Ménétrier-Caux C, De Villartay JP, Walzer T, Belot A (2015) PRKDC mutations associated with immunodeficiency, granuloma, and autoimmune regulator-dependent autoimmunity. J Allergy Clin Immunol 135(6):1578-1588.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.jaci.2015.01.040.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis is made by examination of the circulating [[lymphocyte]]s and gene sequencing.
==Genetics==

This condition is due to mutations in the [[DNA-PKcs]] gene and is inheritable in an autosomal recessive fashion. 

The gene is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 8]] (8q11.21) on the minus strand. It encodes a protein of 4128 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 469 kiloDaltons. The encoded protein is a protein kinase that is activated by [[DNA]]. This protein acts as a sensor for damaged DNA.

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===

* [[Ataxia telangectasia]] 
* [[Severe combined immunodeficiency|Artemis deficiency]] 
* [[LIG4 syndrome]] 
* [[Nijmegen breakage syndrome]]
* [[Severe combined immunodeficiency|Severe combined immunodeficiency with Cernunnos]] 
* [[X-linked agammaglobulinemia]]
==Management==
{{Empty section|date=January 2018}}
==Epidemiology==

This condition is rare. Only two cases have been described up to 2017.&lt;ref name=Woodbine2013&gt;Woodbine L, Neal JA, Sasi, N-K, Shimada M, Deem K, Coleman H, Dobyns WB, Ogi T, Meek K, Davies EG, Jeggo PA (2013)  PRKDC mutations in a SCID patient with profound neurological abnormalities. J Clin Invest 123: 2969-2980&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

This condition was described in 2009 by van der Burg et al.&lt;ref name=vanderBurg2009&gt;van der Burg M, Ijspeert H, Verkaik NS, Turul T, Wiegant WW, Morotomi-Yano K, Mari, P-O, Tezcan I, Chen, DJ, Zdzienicka MZ, van Dongen JJM, van Gent DC (2009) A DNA-PKCS mutation in a radiosensitive T-B- SCID patient inhibits Artemis activation and nonhomologous end-joining.

'''Kolibree''' is a company based in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], [[France]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kolibree.com/en/team/&lt;/ref&gt; that is known for developing a [[mobile device|smart]] toothbrush.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kolibree.com/en/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Colibri'' means "hummingbird" in French; perhaps a reference to their signature product's light weight, about 64g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kolibree.com/en/product/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702202202/http://www.kolibree.com/en/product/ |archivedate=2015-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kickstarter==
In April 2014, the company launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for its device and raised over $100,000.

==Design==
The toothbrush connects via [[Bluetooth]] to a smartphone app and can tell users whether or not they are brushing well.  Also available is a choice of video games, in which good brushing is rewarded with high scores in the game.&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2015/01/07/kolibree-gamifies-its-smart-electric-toothbrush-video/&lt;/ref&gt;  The toothbrush has removable heads; thus the same brush can be shared by different people without worry of contamination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150610006138/en/Toothbrush-Innovator-Kolibree-Completes-Funding-Support-Rapid#.VZTGsPlViko&lt;/ref&gt;

==AI toothbrush==
In 2017 at CES Las Vegas, Kolibree introduced ARA, an updated version of its toothbrush, promising AI software that records and detects bad brushing habits.

==AR toothbrush==
In 2018 at CES Las Vegas, Kolibree introduced Magik, a kids version of its toothbrush with Augmented Reality detection that helps children play with a smartphone App while cleaning their teeth.

'''Korea Occupational Safety &amp; Health Agency''' (안전보건공단, 韓國産業安全保健公團) is a body in [[South Korea]], which serves to protect the health and safety of Korean workers.

==The advent of KOSHA==

It was late 1980s that KOSHA (Korea Occupational Safety &amp; Health Agency) Law was released to the public. After the KOSHA Act was released in 1986, the labor department of Korea, which is the competent organization of KOSHA, moved to the next step that set up the plan for establishing KOSHA and inaugurated the institution committee for KOSHA in 1987. Since then, KOSHA has been taking responsibility for the important role in [[occupational safety and health]] in the workplace.

It had been a long time for people to look forward to working at the workplace without getting involved in occupational accidents or diseases. It was one of the fastest changing periods for Koreans who lived in during the industrial revolution of Korea. Before moving to the history of KOSHA, we need to examine the environmental and societal circumstances that lead to its development.

Korea experienced significant [[economic growth]], the so-called "the miracle of Han river", during a five-year-long [[Economic development|Economic Development]] Plan beginning in 1962. It resulted from two societal factors, the movement of population from rural to urban environments and the change of major industry. According to the statistic of Koreans agricultural department, the majority of Korean made a living engaging in farming and over 80% of people in Korea belonged to the rural community at that time. In particular, the rice culture that has been the most important crop in Korea since the Lee Dynasty, it required significant physical labor, but the gains from that were in vain, compared to the time and labor that farmers spent on doing that. Also, the Korean government tried to improve the quality of life in an agricultural village, but people who knew a vicious circle of farming were driven into cities which needed less expensive labor. At the very beginning of industrial boom, most small-medium factories and industries could take-off to increase in light of size and quality through using these affluent labor powers.

Thus, as industrial facilities became larger and the process became varied, the rate of exposure to the dangerous materials were increased, numerous occupational disasters and diseases broke out and started to affect on the health of workers, both directly and indirectly. Since the statistics of occupational disaster were begun during July, 1964, taking the industrial accidents compensation insurance effect, over two million of workers were involved in occupational accidents. Among them, over 20,000 workers died, the remained became the disabled and the economic loss reached the amount of 6,000 million dollars (KOSHA 20th annual report).

Likewise, as occupational disasters became a bigger issue in the view of society and economics, the Korean government established and released the Occupational and Safety Law in 1981. But that was not enough to stop the growth of the rate of occupational disasters. Even the casualties of industrial accidents continued to increase because of the shortage of the experts and because owners of industries lacked interest. Hence, there were few effective ways to prevent those accidents. Accordingly, the government recognized the seriousness of the incident's harm and searched for a solution by establishing a [[Professional body|professional organization]] for preventing occupational disaster.

Also, there has been pressure from [[Trade union|labor unions]] and from society. Until that time, Korea had been ruled by presidents from army circles since [[Park Chung Hee|President Park]] was inaugurated by a [[Coup d'état|military coup]] in 1961. They did not allow workers to establish trade unions or ask for the enactment of the Labor Union Act, although there were, in name only, Labor Acts such as the Labor Standard Act, the Mediation Act in labor trouble. These were used for the benefit of owners. When seen from the political view, there were a significant number of demonstrations for democracy in Korea. The different point is that workers, including [[White-collar worker|white collar]] workers, and the general public joined the request. Demonstrations were usually college students' before 1986. Especially, workers called upon substantial laws to reinforce owners who pursued the profit, but were not interested in employees' [[Human rights|basic rights]]. Consequently, the Korean government stepped forward to establish a professional organization intended to protect the basic rights of workers at worksites.

KOSHA's goals involve promoting the safety and health of workers, encouraging efficient business to prevent industrial accidents, and to motivate business proprietors into joining them, contributing to the improvement of economic development. The meanings of the establishment can be summarized as follows.

# KOSHA offers professional knowledge and experts to establish, national, synthetic and technical systems of occupational accident prevention.

# KOSHA advocates for providing safe and clean environments for workers and contributes to enlighten Korean society about safety.

# KOSHA seeks to reduce the rate of industrial disasters that prevent Korea from entering the [[developed country]]; it raised the power of national competition to join the OECD. ([[E-book]] of the history of KOSHA)

Likewise, KOSHA was established having a significant mission to protect the precious life, physical safety, and health of workers. Also, KOSHA uplifted the quality of life while growing into a professional organization.

==The office organization and staff of KOSHA==

At the beginning of the institution, there was one headquarters, two branch offices, and one education center. It had 368 employees including, one president and three trustees. KOSHA has reorganized twenty-one times to provide the best service for workers and to deal with the ever-changing society and occupational safety policy of government. The contents of important reforms are as follows.

# In 1989, the research center was newly established.

# In 1991, KOSHA extensively reformed the staff organization in accordance with KOSHA Act. Thus, the size of the organization increased and employed over 800 people.

# In 1995, KOSHA needed to form a division into the department for promoting [[safety culture]] to let people get to know the safety at the worksites because big accidents kept occurring.

# In 2001, KOSHA reorganized the division into teams and founded Human Resource Development (HRD) team.

# In 2003, KOSHA added one more branch office in Jeju and two chemical research centers to manage chemical materials.
	
# In 2004, human power at headquarters was reduced and transferred to 20 branch offices.

# In 2006, KOSHA has become a flexible organization to support the relationship between businesses and, to make it possible to focus on the scene of labor. Also, the [[human resources]] that were separated into technical and management parts, were integrated on one part.

# At present, KOSHA has a headquarters that consists of nine departments and 19 teams, an education center, a research center, and 20 branch offices around Korea where over 1,300 occupational experts do their best to prevent industrial disasters from happening at the worksite.

Likewise, KOSHA has changed a lot with respect to office and staff organization to adapt to the new environment that the entire world entered into the age of unlimited competition represented as the age of information and globalization.

==Basic businesses==

From the beginning, KOSHA played a significant role preventing occupational hazards, accidents, and diseases from worksites. Speaking of the businesses, first we cannot help but talk about the development and spread of prevention technologies, support to educate workers visiting worksites, as well as, analysis and inspection of facilities that are likely to bring the danger or harmfulness, since KOSHA was released.

KOSHA focused on activities such as safety diagnoses, guiding new technologies, and education for workers concerned with safety and health that workers and workplaces were asking for in the beginning. It took two years for KOSHA to develop and spread the systematic ways such as visiting worksites and analyzing causes or doing epidemiology research to find the cause of industrial accidents.

It was in 1995 that KOSHA was absorbed in trying to reduce the rate of occupational accidents because the campaign for safety culture at workplaces was widespread all over the country. Therefore, KOSHA started to take an action that put aside the some amount of money to prevent those accidents in small and medium businesses that were blamed for occupying the 73.5% of total occupational disasters. Also, the rate of industrial accidents was plunged under 1% that is the sign of getting into the developed country.

In [[epidemiology]], '''lagging''' (or ''exposure lagging'') means excluding the exposure in a time period before registration of an outcome. It may be motivated by that the actual outcome had actually occurred before the registration of it, and that the last exposure before registration did not contribute to the case.&lt;ref&gt;Page 301 in: Modern epidemiology. Authors: Kenneth J. Rothman, Sander Greenland, Timothy L. Lash. Edition: 3, illustrated. Publisher: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2008. {{ISBN|0-7817-5564-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7817-5564-1}}. Length: 758 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when studying [[risk factor]]s of cancer, the cancer process may have been triggered long before actual diagnosis of cancer, and that therefore any exposure to risk factors in the ''lag'' time between may be unimportant.

It can be used to mitigate [[protopathic bias]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tamim H, Monfared AA, LeLorier J |title=Application of lag-time into exposure definitions to control for protopathic bias |journal=Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=250–8 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17245804 |doi=10.1002/pds.1360 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, when a treatment for the first symptoms of a disease or other outcome appear to cause the outcome. Protopathic bias is a potential bias when there is a lag time from the first symptoms and start of treatment before actual diagnosis.&lt;ref name=fenstein&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feinstein AR, Horwitz RI |title=A critique of the statistical evidence associating estrogens with endometrial cancer |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=38 |issue=11 Pt 2 |pages=4001–5 |date=November 1978 |pmid=698947 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ligovsky Canal''' ({{lang-ru|Ли́говский кана́л}}) is one of the most extended channels of [[Saint Petersburg]] ([[Russia]]). Constructed in 1721, it is {{convert|23|km|mi}} long. Its purpose was to supply water for the fountains of the [[Summer Garden]]. The channel delivered water from the [[Dudergofka River|Liga River]] (now called the Dudergofka) to ponds in [[Nekrasov Street|Bassejnaya Street]] (modern Nekrasov Street).

==History==
The idea of construction of the channel belongs to the Russian emperor and reformer [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]]. He decided to decorate the Summer Garden with fountains supplied by water delivered by [[gravity feed]]. A small river, Liga (now called the Dudergofka), near ([[Dudergofskoye Lake]]), became a water source. The project designer was [[Grigory Grigoryevich Skornyakov-Pisarev|G.&amp;nbsp;Skornyakov-Pisarev]], who also supervised the channel construction.

Except the basic function of actuating of fountains, the canal was used as a [[water main]] and as a [[Moat|defensive boundary]], protecting the capital on the southeast. The project was completed in three years, 1718–21. It is known that the channel crossed at least two bridges, one at [[Moskovsky Prospekt]] and one at [[Vosstaniya Square|Znamenskya Square]] (in a photo). Later at building [[Obvodny Canal]] in the beginning 20th century has been constructed [[Novo-kamenniy bridge|Yamskoi Vodoprovodniy Aqueduct]], author of the project of the wooden bridge became Russian engineer [[Ivan Arkadievich Gerard|Ivan Gerard]]. Later the bridge under [[Leninsky Prospekt, Saint Petersburg|Leninsky Prospekt]] has been constructed; Data on its dismantling are not present, it is probable it is filled up together with the channel and has remained underground.

[[Flooding of 1777|Flooding of]] {{OldStyleDate|21 September|1777|10 September}} destroyed the fountains of the Summer Garden and the reason for the channel disappeared. In addition, the water in the channel became muddy and undrinkable. The channel gradually became unfit for use and was filled up in stages:
* In 1891–92, the site from [[Tauride Palace|Tauride garden]] to Obvodny Canal was filled up. Yamskoi Vodoprovodniy Aqueduct was reconstructed in 1895 and was renamed Novo-kamenniy bridge. [[Granite]] pools at the bridge existed before the beginning 20th century, when then were disassembled as superfluous.
* In 1926, the site from Obvodny Canal to Moskovsky Prospekt was filled up;
* In 1965–69, waters of the canal were lowered in [[Krasnenkaya|Krasnenkaya River]], and the channel was truncated before crossing [[Krasnoputilovskaya street]].
{{Water system of Ligovsky Canal}}
In its place, [[Ligovsky Prospekt|Ligovsky Avenue]] was laid.

==Facts==
Now near a railway line to luga channel waters enter an underground channel and exit the surface near Krasnenkaya River. There the canal is divided into two sleeves: the majority of the canal waters are carried away by the Krasnenkaya River, the smaller branch an underground passage exits in the ponds of [[Aviatorov Garden]]. The length of the remaining part is {{convert|11|km|mi|0}}.

On the bank of the channel in 1834–38 was constructed the [[Moscow Triumphal Gate]]. It was built mainly in cast iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russian: Раскин&amp;nbsp;А.&amp;nbsp;Г.|first=Raskin&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;G.|title=Triumphal arches of Leningrad Russian: Триумфальные арки Ленинграда|location=Leningrad|year=1977|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filled-up Ligovsky Canal became a hindrance to construction of a metro station [[Ploshchad Vosstaniya]] - at sinking an inclined tunnel of an exit on a surface wet stratum have strongly complicated works. They should be overcome, applying a [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] and to a breed [[frost]] a hydrochloric solution in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The metro will not be Russian: МетрА не будет|date=2002-08-05|publisher=[http://www.versiya.org/ Verssija v Sankt-Peterburge]  Russian: Версия в Санкт-Петербурге|language=ru}} [http://metro.nwd.ru/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=2543 There is article text in Russian]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marian Panchyshyn''', {{lang-uk|Мар'я́н Панчи́шин }} (1882 in Lviv, [[Austria-Hungary]] - October 9, 1943 in Munich, [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]) was a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] medical doctor and public figure. He was both member of a healing organization, and vice-president of the Ukrainian Republic proclaimed on June 30, 1941.

==Medical career==
Markian Panchyshyn was a member of the social network "Narodna Lichnytsia" ({lang-ua:Народна Лічниця}).

Panchyshyn was considered to be the most popular doctor in Western Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/upahistory/_encyklopedia/p.htm%23PelZ&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:36:26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the 1941 Ukrainian State Administration==
Because of his medical prowess, Panchyshyn was elected as [[Minister of Health]] of [[Ukrainian National Government (1941)|Ukrainian State Administration]] on June 30, 1941.

Unfortunately, this did not survive the persecution of the Nazis. He was forced to flee into exile, with other members of the Ukrainian government.

==Death==
Marian Panchyshyn died in Munich, Germany, on October 9, 1943.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/upahistory/_encyklopedia/p.htm%23PelZ&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:36:26&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988''' is a [[United States federal law]] concerning the illegal dumping of body tissues, blood wastes and other contaminated biological materials. It established heavy penalties for knowingly endangering life through noncompliance.

==Authority==
The law created a two-year program that went into effect in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[Puerto Rico]] on June 24, 1989, and expired on June 21, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Medical Waste Tracking Act, P.L. 100-582, Nov. 1, 1988, {{USStat|102|2950}}, {{USC|42|6992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA MWTA"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC (2010). [http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/industrial/medical/tracking.htm "Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988."] 2010-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The H.R. 3515 [[legislation]] was passed by the 100th Congressional session and signed into law by the 40th [[President of the United States]] Ronald Reagan on November 2, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=35097 |title= Ronald Reagan: "Statement on Signing the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 ," November 2, 1988 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Beginning on August 13, 1987, a "30-mile garbage slick" composed primarily of [[Medical waste|medical]] and [[household waste]]s prompted extensive closures of numerous [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] [[beach]]es.&lt;ref name="Markowitz"&gt;Markowitz, Eve. "State Narrows Probe of Beach Pollution." The Record [NJ] 27 Aug. 1987: A03. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations ongoing throughout the year indicated that the waste likely originated from "[[New York City]]'s [[Marine transfer operations|marine transfer stations]] … and the Southwest Brooklyn Incinerator and Transfer Station in particular…"&lt;ref name="EPA MWTA" /&gt; The then-assistant commissioner of the [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] stated his belief that the cause of [[pollution]] was intentional rather than accidental; "sealed plastic [[garbage bag]]s, he said, were cut at the top, so their contents could disperse through the ocean."&lt;ref name="Markowitz" /&gt; Such a deliberate action may have arisen given the high cost (~$1500/ton) associated with the legal disposal of the waste, thus incentivizing private [[Waste disposal|waste contractors]] to dump illegally to avoid high fees.

Ultimately the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 (MWTA) arose from the aftermath of this situation. It was designed primarily to monitor the treatment of medical wastes through their creation, transportation and destruction, i.e. from "cradle-to-grave." [[United States Congress|Congress]] approved the bill "to amend the [[Solid Waste Disposal Act]] to require the Administrator of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to promulgate regulations on the management of infections waste."&lt;ref name="HR3515" /&gt; In short, Congress enacted the MWTA as a [[pilot study]] to better determine how the life cycle of medical wastes played out under [[federal regulations]].

== Purpose ==

=== Definitions ===
Section 11002 of the MWTA, "Listing of Medical Wastes," provides a listing of definitions on what materials will be classified as "medical wastes" under the act.&lt;ref name="HR3515" /&gt; The list includes within its definitions: "cultures and stocks of [[infectious agent]]s," "pathological wastes" such as [[body tissue]]s, blood wastes and blood byproducts, [[Sharps waste|sharps]], contaminated carcasses and beddings of animals, [[surgery]] or [[autopsy]] wastes that were once in contact with infectious agents, "laboratory wastes," "dialysis wastes that were in contact with the blood of patients undergoing [[hemodialysis]]," [[medical equipment]] having come in contact with infectious agents, and further contaminated biological materials.&lt;ref name="EPA MWTA" /&gt; Defining what objects were to be classified as medical wastes was crucial to ensure that all [[Local government in the United States|municipalities]] under the MWTA would be monitoring similar materials.

=== Management and tracking ===
Section 11003, "Tracking of Medical Waste," outlined how the program should manage the transportation of [[waste material]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA MWTA" /&gt; Four requirements were primarily identified; first, to provide a means of monitoring "the transportation of waste from the generator to the disposal facility" unless said waste had previously been [[Incineration|incinerated]]. Secondly, to be able to ensure the "generator of the waste" that the waste had been "received by the disposal facility." Next to develop a uniform form for the tracking of materials across states and finally to develop a means to label and contain the wastes for the safety of the handlers.

Following this, Section 11004 on "Inspections" provides provisions allowing for agents of the EPA to "enter… any establishment… where medical wastes are or have been generated" so as to conduct "monitoring", "testing", or to "obtain samples from any person.".&lt;ref name="HR3515"&gt;United States. Cong. House and Senate. H.R.3515. 100th Cong., 2nd sess. Washington: GPO, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This process would allow for the Agency to legally enter generating facilities for the purpose of determining if infectious agents and materials were being handled as prescribed by the EPA Administrator.

=== Enforcement ===
A major point of importance within the MWTA involves its inclusion of enforcement laws within the [[legislation]]. This becomes notable as it allows for one of the first instances in which an agency of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] may prosecute those charged with violation of regulations dealing with medical wastes. Following enactment of the MWTA the EPA Administrator may be allowed to "commence [[civil action]] in the [[United States district court]] in the district in which the violation occurred" against those being charged with the violation.

Penalties ranged based on the level of violation, whether it was done with intention, and if such acts endangered the lives of other individuals. Minor violations of [[Compliance (regulation)|compliance orders]] would have resulted in a fine of $25,000 per day of "continued noncompliance." Criminal penalties against those knowingly and intentionally violating the regulations of the MWTA may face two years of [[imprisonment]] or a $50,000 [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] while those guilty of knowingly endangering the life of another through noncompliance may face upwards of fifteen years imprisonment and a $1,000,000 fine.

== Outcomes ==
Through the information gathered during the promulgation of regulations for the MWTA, over a period of ten years the EPA eventually "concluded that the [[disease]]-causing potential of medical waste is greatest at the point of generation and naturally tapers off after that point... Thus, risk to the general public of disease caused by exposure to medical waste is likely to be much lower than risk for the occupationally exposed individual."&lt;ref name="EPA MWTA" /&gt;

The '''Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act''',&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|108|173}}, {{USStat|117|2066}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called the '''Medicare Modernization Act''' or '''MMA''', is a federal law of the United States, enacted in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/01_Overview.asp |title=Medicare Modernization Act Update - Overview |publisher=[[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] |accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produced the largest overhaul of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in the public health program's 38-year history.

The MMA was signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on December 8, 2003, after passing in [[United States Congress|Congress]] by a close margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2003/roll332.xml |title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 332: Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prescription drug benefits ==
{{main|Medicare Part D}}
The MMA's most touted feature is the introduction of an [[entitlement]] benefit for [[prescription drug]]s, through tax breaks and subsidies.

In the years since Medicare's creation in 1965, the role of [[prescription drug]]s in patient care has significantly increased. As new and expensive drugs have come into use, patients, particularly [[senior citizens]] at whom Medicare was targeted, have found prescriptions harder to afford. The MMA was designed to address this problem.

The benefit is funded in a complex way, reflecting diverse priorities of [[Lobbying|lobbyists]] and constituencies.
* It provides a subsidy for large employers to discourage them from eliminating private prescription coverage to retired workers (a key [[American Association of Retired Persons|AARP]] goal);
* It prohibits the federal government from negotiating discounts with drug companies;
* It prevents the government from establishing a [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]], but does not prevent private providers such as [[Health maintenance organization|HMOs]] from doing so.

=== Basic prescription drug coverage ===
Beginning in 2006, a prescription drug benefit called '''[[Medicare Part D]]''' was made available. Coverage is available only through insurance companies and HMOs, and is voluntary.

Enrollees paid the following initial costs for the initial benefits: a minimum monthly premium of $24.80 (premiums may vary), a $180 to $265 annual deductible, 25% (or approximate flat copay) of full drug costs up to $2,400. After the initial coverage limit is met, a period commonly referred to as the "[[Donut Hole (Medicare)|Donut Hole]]" begins when an enrollee may be responsible for the insurance company's negotiated price of the drug, less than the retail price without insurance. The [[Affordable Care Act]], also commonly known as "'''Obamacare'''", modified this measure.

==Medicare Advantage plans==
With the passage of the [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]], Medicare beneficiaries were given the option to receive their Medicare benefits through private [[health insurance]] plans, instead of through the Original Medicare plan (Parts A and B). These programs were known as "Medicare+Choice" or "Part C" plans. Pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the compensation and business practices for insurers that offer these plans changed, and "Medicare+Choice" plans became known as "Medicare Advantage" (MA) plans. In addition to offering comparable coverage to Part A and Part B, Medicare Advantage plans may also offer Part D coverage.

===Changes to plans===
With the MMA, new Medicare Advantage plans were established with several advantages over the previous Medicare + Choice plans:
* enrollees sign on for a whole year
* care can be restricted to networks of providers
* formularies can be used to restrict prescription drug choices
* prescription coverage can be deferred to the patient or a Medicare Part D prescription plan
* care other than emergency care can be restricted to a particular region
* federal reimbursement can be adjusted according to the health risk of the enrollees

==Health savings accounts==
The MMA created a new Health Savings Account statute that replaced and expanded the previous Medical Savings Account law by expanding allowable contributions and employer participation. After the first 10 years over 12 million Americans were enrolled in HSAs (AHIP;EBRI).{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Other provisions==
While nearly all agreed that some form of prescription drug benefit would be included, other provisions were the subject of prolonged debate in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The complex legislation also changed Medicare in the following ways:
* it mandated a six-city trial of a partly privatized Medicare system (by 2010)
* it gave an extra $25 billion to rural hospitals (at the request of congressional representatives in the rural West)
* it required higher fees from wealthier seniors
* it added a pretax [[Health Savings Accounts|health savings account]] for working people
* it required Medicare Part D plans to support [[electronic prescribing]], with a planned implementation date of April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Bell DS and Friedman MA (2005). "E-Prescribing And The Medicare Modernization Act Of 2003"  Health Affairs, 24, no. 5 (2005): 1159–1169 {{doi|10.1377/hlthaff.24.5.1159}} http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/24/5/1159&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicare administration of claims===
In addition, the legislation mandated a major overhaul of how Part A and Part B claims are processed.

Under the new legislation, the FI's and carriers would be replaced by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC's), serving both Parts A and B, and would be consolidated into fifteen Jurisdictions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Content_Folders&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=41603] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127104923/http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Content_Folders&amp;TEMPLATE=%2FCM%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=41603 |date=2008-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jurisdiction 1—California, Hawaii, and Nevada, plus American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands
* Jurisdiction 2—Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington
* Jurisdiction 3—Arizona, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming
* Jurisdiction 4—Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas
* Jurisdiction 5—Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska
* Jurisdiction 6—Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin
* Jurisdiction 7—Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi
* Jurisdiction 8—Indiana and Michigan
* Jurisdiction 9—Florida, plus Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
* Jurisdiction 10—Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee
* Jurisdiction 11—North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia
* Jurisdiction 12—Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania
* Jurisdiction 13—Connecticut and New York
* Jurisdiction 14—Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont
* Jurisdiction 15—Kentucky and Ohio

Four "Specialty MAC Jurisdictions" were also created to handle durable medical equipment and home health/hospice claims:
* Jurisdiction A—consists of all states in Jurisdictions 12, 13, and 14
* Jurisdiction B—consists of all states in Jurisdictions 6, 8, and 15
* Jurisdiction C—consists of all states and territories in Jurisdictions 4, 7, 9, 10, and 11
* Jurisdiction D—consists of all states and territories in Jurisdictions 1, 2, 3, and 5

Finally, the underlying contracts would be subject to competition, and would also be subject to the requirements of the [[Cost Accounting Standards]] and the [[Federal Acquisition Regulation]].

==Legislative history==
According to the [[New York Times]] December 17, 2004 editorial [[Billy Tauzin|W.J."Billy" Tauzin]], the Louisiana Republican who chaired the [[U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Energy and Commerce Committee]] from 2001 until February 4, 2004 was one of the chief architects of the new Medicare law.&lt;ref name="NYT_2004_dec_17"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/17/opinion/the-drug-lobby-scores-again.html | title=The Drug Lobby Scores Again | publisher=New York Times | date=17 December 2004 | accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USNews_2004"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=12105168&amp;site=ehost-live | title=A Political Prescription | publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report via EBSCO | date=2004 | accessdate=22 November 2015 | author=Samuel, Terence | pages=27–28 |volume=136 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 when Tauzin was appointed as chief lobbyist for the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA), the trade association and lobby group for the drug industry with a "rumored salary of $2 million a year,"&lt;ref name="NYT_2004_dec_17" /&gt; drawing criticism from a Washington-based [[Public Citizen]], the consumer advocacy group. They claimed that Tauzin "may have been negotiating for the lobbying job while writing the Medicare legislation."&lt;ref name="USNews_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost_dec_2004"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3504-2004Dec15.html | work=Washington Post | date=15 December 2015 | accessdate=22 November 2015 | author=Sarasohn,  Judy |title=Tauzin to Head Drug Trade Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tauzin was responsible for including a provision that prohibited Medicare from negotiating prices with drug companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Wendell |last1=Potter |first2=Nick |last2=Penniman |title=Nation on the Take: How Big Money Corrupts Our Democracy and What We Can Do About It |date=March 2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=9781632861108 |postscript=,}} excerpt published as {{cite web |url=http://billmoyers.com/story/the-man-who-made-you-pay-more-at-the-drugstore/ |title=The Lobbyist Who Made You Pay More at the Drugstore |work=billmoyers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It's a sad commentary on politics in Washington that a member of Congress who pushed through a major piece of legislation benefiting the drug industry, gets the job leading that industry.|Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook 2004}}

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said,&lt;ref name="USNews_2004" /&gt;

{{quote|I think if seniors want to know why the pharmaceutical companies made out so well at their expense, all they have to do is look at this. This is an abuse of power. This is a conflict of interest.|House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi 2004}}

The bill was debated and negotiated for nearly six months in Congress, and finally passed amid unusual circumstances. Several times in the legislative process the bill had appeared to have failed, but each time was saved when a couple of Congressmen and Senators switched positions on the bill.

The bill was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] early on June 25, 2003 as H.R. 1, sponsored by [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Dennis Hastert]]. All that day and the next the bill was debated, and it was apparent that the bill would be very divisive. In the early morning of June 27, a floor vote was taken. After the initial electronic vote, the count stood at 214 yeas, 218 nays.

Three Republican representatives then changed their votes. One opponent of the bill, [[Ernest J. Istook, Jr.]] (R-OK-5), changed his vote to "present" upon being told that [[C.W. Bill Young]] (R-FL-10), who was absent due to a death in the family, would have voted "aye" if he had been present. Next, Republicans [[Butch Otter]] (ID-1) and [[Jo Ann Emerson]] (MO-8) switched their vote to "aye" under pressure from the party leadership. The bill passed by one vote, 216-215.

On June 26, the Senate passed its version of the bill, 76-21. The bills were unified in conference, and on November 21, the bill came back to the House for approval.

The bill came to a vote at 3 a.m. on November 22. After 45 minutes, the bill was losing, 219-215, with [[David Wu]] (D-OR-1) not voting. Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]] and Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]] sought to convince some of dissenting Republicans to switch their votes, as they had in June. Istook, who had always been a wavering vote, consented quickly, producing a 218-216 tally. In a highly unusual move, the House leadership held the vote open for hours as they sought two more votes. Then-Representative [[Nick Smith (U.S. politician)|Nick Smith]] (R-MI) claimed he was offered campaign funds for his son, who was running to replace him, in return for a change in his vote from "nay" to "yea." After controversy ensued, Smith clarified no explicit offer of campaign funds was made, but that he was offered "substantial and aggressive campaign support" which he had assumed included financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,104954,00.html | title = Congressman Denies Medicare Vote Bribe Charge | publisher = [[Associated Press]] | date = 2003-12-05 | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 5:50&amp;nbsp;a.m., Otter and [[Trent Franks]] (AZ-2) were convinced to switch their votes. With passage assured, Wu voted yea as well, and Democrats [[Calvin M. Dooley]] (CA-20), [[Jim Marshall (U.S. politician)|Jim Marshall]] (GA-3) and [[David Scott (Georgia politician)|David Scott]] (GA-13) changed their votes to the affirmative. But [[Brad Miller (congressman)|Brad Miller]] (D-NC-13), and then, Republican [[John Culberson]] (TX-7), reversed their votes from "yea" to "nay". The bill passed 220-215.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2003/roll669.xml | title = Final Vote Results For Roll Call 669 | work = [[United States House of Representatives]] Legislation and Records | date = 2003-11-22 | accessdate = 2009-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democrats cried foul, and [[Bill Thomas]], the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means committee, challenged the result in a gesture to satisfy the concerns of the minority. He subsequently voted to table his own challenge; the tally to table was 210 ayes, 193 noes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The Senate's consideration of the conference report was somewhat less heated, as [[cloture]] on it was invoked by a vote of 70-29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00457 | title = On the Cloture Motion (Motion to Invoke Cloture on the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 1 ) | work = [[United States Senate]] Legislation and Records | date = 2003-11-24 | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a budget point of order raised by [[Tom Daschle]], and voted on. As 60 votes were necessary to override it, the challenge was actually considered to have a credible chance of passing.

For several minutes, the vote total was stuck at 58-39, until Senators [[Lindsey Graham]] (R-SC), [[Trent Lott]] (R-MS), and [[Ron Wyden]] (D-OR) voted in quick succession in favour to pass the vote 61-39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00458 | title = On the Motion (Motion To Waive CBA RE: H. R. 1 - Conference Report) | work = [[United States Senate]] Legislation and Records | date = 2003-11-24 | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill itself was finally passed 54-44 on November 25, 2003, and was signed into law by the President on December 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00459

==Costs==
Initially, the net cost of the program was projected at $400 billion for the ten-year period between 2004 and 2013. Administration official [[Thomas A. Scully|Thomas Scully]] instructed analyst Richard Foster not to tell Congress of Foster's finding that the cost would actually be over $500 billion. One month after passage, the administration estimated that the net cost of the program over the period between 2006 (the first year the program started paying benefits) and 2015 would be $534 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/30/nation/na-medicare30 | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Medicare Drug Benefit Plan to Far Exceed Cost Estimate | first=Vicki | last=Kemper | date=January 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2009, the projected net cost of the program over the 2006 to 2015 period was $549.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;2009 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARDS OF TRUSTEES OF THE FEDERAL HOSPITAL INSURANCE AND FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTARY MEDICAL INSURANCE TRUST FUNDS, Table III.C19.—Operations of the Part D Account in the SMI Trust Fund (Cash Basis) during Calendar Years 2004-2018, Page 120 (Page 126 in pdf) http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/tr2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiating of prescription drug prices==
Since the enactment of Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act in 2003, only [[insurance]] companies administering Medicare prescription drug program, not Medicare, have the legal right to negotiate drug prices directly from drug manufacturers. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act expressly prohibited Medicare from negotiating bulk prescription drug prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=108th Congress Public Law 173 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |number=DOCID: f:publ173.108 |pages=2065–6 |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-108publ173/html/PLAW-108publ173.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "donut hole" provision of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] was an attempt to correct the issue.&lt;ref name="medicare.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11493.pdf |title=Closing the Coverage Gap – Medicare Prescription Drugs Are Becoming More Affordable |date=January 2015 |publisher=CMS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523191556/http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11493.pdf |archivedate=May 23, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport''' ({{lang-nl|Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport}}; VWS) is the [[Ministries of the Netherlands|Dutch Ministry]] responsible for [[public health]], [[health care]], [[quality of life]], [[social work]] and [[sport]]. The Ministry was created in 1951 as the "Ministry of Social Affairs and Health" and had several name changes before it became the "Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport" in 1994. The Ministry is headed by the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport, currently [[Hugo de Jonge]] ([[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]]), assisted by one State secretary, currently [[Paul Blokhuis]] ([[Christian Union (Netherlands)|CU]]), and the Minister for Medical Care, currently [[Bruno Bruins]] ([[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]]).

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

==Organisation==
The ministry is currently headed by two Cabinet Ministers and one [[Secretary of state|State secretary]]. The ministry's main office is located in the centre of [[The Hague]]. The civil service is headed by a secretary general and a deputy secretary general, who head a system of three directorates general:
* Public Health, responsible for safety, prevention and sports
* Health Care, responsible for care, medicine and health insurance
* Youth and Welfare 

The ministry is also responsible for several autonomous agencies, most prominently:
* Social and Cultural Planning Office
* [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]]

==History==
There had been a ministry of Social Work since 1952. In 1965 it was also given responsibility for Culture and Recreation and it was named Ministry of Culture, Recreation and Social Work. Between 1951 and 1973 there had been a Ministry of Social Affairs and Health Care. In 1973 a separate Ministry of Health and the Environment was formed. In 1982 these two ministries merged to form the Ministry for Health, Welfare and Sports. Responsibilities concerning the environment and nature management were given to the newly reorganized [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (Netherlands)|Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] and [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (Netherlands)|Agriculture, Nature and Fisheries]]. The ministry built a new headquarters in 2003 designed by architect [[Michael Graves]].  
In 1996 the responsibility for culture was transferred to the newly reorganized [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (Netherlands)|Ministry of Education, Science and Culture]].

The '''''Natural History''''' ({{lang-la|Naturalis Historia}}) is a book about the whole of the natural world in [[Latin]] by [[Pliny the Elder]], a Roman author and naval commander who died in 79 AD.

It is one of the largest single works to have survived from the [[Roman Empire]] to the modern day and purports to cover all ancient knowledge. The work's subject area is thus not limited to what is today understood by [[natural history]]; Pliny himself defines his scope as "the natural world, or life".&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' I:13&lt;/ref&gt; It is encyclopedic in scope, but its structure is not like that of a modern [[encyclopedia]].

The work is divided into 37 books, organised into ten volumes. These cover topics including [[astronomy]], [[mathematics]], [[geography]], [[ethnography]], [[anthropology]], human [[physiology]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], [[pharmacology]], [[Mining#Ancient Greek and Roman Mining|mining]], [[mineralogy]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], and [[Engraved gem|precious stones]].

Pliny's ''Natural History'' became a model for later encyclopedias and scholarly works as a result of its breadth of subject matter, its [[Citation|referencing]] of original authors, and its [[Index (publishing)|index]]. The work is dedicated to the emperor [[Titus]], a son of Pliny's close friend, the emperor [[Vespasian]], in the first year of Titus's reign. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published. He began it in 77, and had not made a final revision at the time of [[Pliny the Elder#Death|his death]] during the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|AD&amp;nbsp;79 eruption of Vesuvius]].

==Overview==
[[File:Plinius t y Venezia 1499 IMG 3886.JPG|thumb|''Naturalis Historia'', work printed by Johannes Alvisius in 1499 in [[Venice]], Italy]]

Pliny's ''Natural History'' was written alongside other substantial works (which have since been [[Lost work|lost]]). Pliny (23–79) combined his scholarly activities with a busy career as an imperial administrator for the emperor [[Vespasian]]. Much of his writing was done at night; daytime hours were spent working for the emperor, as he explains in the dedicatory preface addressed to Vespasian's elder son, the future emperor [[Titus]], with whom he had served in the army. As for the nocturnal hours spent writing, these were seen not as a loss of sleep but as an addition to life, for as he states in the preface, ''Vita vigilia est'', "to be alive is to be watchful", in a military metaphor of a sentry keeping watch in the night.&lt;ref name=PlinyDedication&gt;''Natural History''. Dedication to Titus: C. Plinius Secundus to his Friend Titus Vespasian&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny claims to be the only Roman ever to have undertaken such a work, in his prayer for the blessing of the universal mother:&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History''  XXXVII:77&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hail to thee, Nature, thou parent of all things! and do thou deign to show thy favour unto me, who, alone of all the citizens of Rome, have, in thy every department, thus made known thy praise.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Natural History'' is encyclopaedic in scope, but its format is unlike a modern [[encyclopaedia]]. However, it does have structure: Pliny uses [[Aristotle]]'s division of [[nature]] (animal, vegetable, mineral) to recreate the natural world in literary form.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to ''Natural History'', Bks. I–II, [[Loeb Classical Library]] (rev. ed. 1989), pp. vii-x.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than presenting compartmentalised, stand-alone entries arranged alphabetically, Pliny's ordered natural landscape is a coherent whole, offering the reader a guided tour: "a brief excursion under our direction among the whole of the works of nature&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History''  VIII:44 (Loeb)&lt;/ref&gt; The work is unified but varied: "My subject is the world of nature&amp;nbsp;... or in other words, life," he tells Titus.&lt;ref name=PlinyDedication/&gt;

[[File:Schedel'sche Weltchronik-Dog head.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Cynocephaly|cynocephalus]], or dog-head, as described by Pliny in his ''Natural History''. From the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (''1493'').]]

Nature for Pliny was divine, a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] concept inspired by the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosophy]] which underlies much of his thought. But the deity in question was a goddess whose main purpose was to serve the human race: "nature, that is life" is human life in a natural landscape. After an initial survey of [[cosmology]] and [[geography]], Pliny starts his treatment of animals with the human race, "for whose sake great Nature appears to have created all other things".&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History''  VII:1 (Rackham et al.)&lt;/ref&gt; This [[teleology|teleological]] view of nature was common in antiquity and is crucial to the understanding of the ''Natural History''.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' VII&lt;/ref&gt; The components of nature are not just described in and for themselves, but also with a view to their role in human life. Pliny devotes a number of the books to plants, with a focus on their medicinal value; the books on minerals include descriptions of their uses in [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]] and [[jewellery]]. Pliny's premise is distinct from modern [[ecology|ecological]] theories, reflecting the prevailing sentiment of his time.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to ''Natural History'', Books III-VII, Loeb Classical Library (rev. ed. 1989), pp. xi-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Strange People - Umbrella Foot (XIIr).jpg|thumb|A [[sciapod]], described by Pliny in his ''Natural History''. From the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (''1493'').]]

Pliny's work frequently reflects Rome's imperial expansion which brought new and exciting things to the capital: exotic eastern spices, strange animals to be put on display or herded into the arena, even the alleged [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] sent to the emperor [[Claudius]] in AD 47 – although, as Pliny admits, this was generally acknowledged to be a fake. Pliny repeated Aristotle's maxim that [[Africa]] was always producing something new. Nature's variety and versatility were claimed to be infinite: "When I have observed nature she has always induced me to deem no statement about her incredible."&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History''  XI:2 (Rackham et al.)&lt;/ref&gt; This led Pliny to recount rumours of strange peoples on the edges of the world.{{efn|Cf. Pliny's consideration of Aristotle, as well as modern criticism of Pliny's work, in Trevor Murphy, ''Pliny the Elder's Natural History: The Empire in the Encyclopedia'', OUP (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–27, 194–215.}} These monstrous races – the [[Cynocephali]] or Dog-Heads, the [[Monopod (creature)|Sciapodae]], whose single foot could act as a sunshade, the mouthless [[Astomi]], who lived on scents – were not strictly new. They had been mentioned by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC, but Pliny made them better known.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' VII:2&lt;/ref&gt;

"As full of variety as nature itself",&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Younger]], ''Letters'',  [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny3.html#5 3.5]&lt;/ref&gt; stated Pliny's nephew, [[Pliny the Younger]], and this verdict largely explains the appeal of the ''Natural History'' since Pliny's death in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79. Pliny had gone to investigate the strange cloud – "shaped like an umbrella pine", according to his nephew – rising from the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Younger]], ''Letters'',  [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny6.html#16 6.16]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Natural History'' was one of the first ancient European texts to be printed, in [[Venice]] in 1469.&lt;ref name=Healy39&gt;Healy, 2004. Introduction:xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philemon Holland]]'s English translation of 1601 has influenced literature ever since.&lt;ref name=Healy39/&gt;

==Structure==

The ''Natural History'' consists of 37 books. Pliny devised a ''summarium,'' or list of contents, at the beginning of the work that was later interpreted by modern printers as a table of contents.{{sfn|Doody|2010|p=9}} The table below is a summary based on modern names for topics.

|}

==Production==

===Purpose===

Pliny's purpose in writing the ''Natural History'' was to cover all learning and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:&lt;ref name=PlinyDedication/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor one in which the mind is eager to range: there is not one of us who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sources===

Pliny studied the original authorities on each subject and took care to make excerpts from their pages. His ''indices auctorum'' sometimes list the authorities he actually consulted, though not exhaustively; in other cases, they cover the principal writers on the subject, whose names are borrowed second-hand from his immediate authorities. He acknowledges his obligations to his predecessors: "To own up to those who were the means of one's own achievements."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/praefatio*.html#21 Praefatio:21]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface, the author claims to have stated 20,000 facts gathered from some 2,000 books and from 100 select authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Anderson, Frank J.  | title=An Illustrated History of the Herbals | publisher=Columbia University Press | year=1977 | isbn=0-231-04002-4 | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extant lists of his authorities cover more than 400, including 146 Roman and 327 Greek and other sources of information. The lists generally follow the order of the subject matter of each book. This has been shown in [[Heinrich Brunn]]'s ''Disputatio'' ([[Bonn]], 1856).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Heinrich Brunn's ''Kleine Schriften Gesammelt Von Hermann Brunn Und Heinrich Bulle...: Bd. Zur Griechischen Kunstgeschichte. Mit 69 Abbildungen Im Text Und Auf Einer Doppeltafel'', 1905 reproduction by Ulan Press (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Pliny's authorities is [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]. In the geographical books, Varro is supplemented by the topographical commentaries of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]], which were completed by the emperor [[Augustus]]; for his [[zoology]], he relies largely on Aristotle and on [[Juba II|Juba]], the scholarly [[Mauretania]]n king, ''studiorum claritate memorabilior quam regno'' (v. 16). Juba is one of his principal guides in botany; [[Theophrastus]] is also named in his Indices, and Pliny had translated Theophrastus's Greek into Latin. Another work by Theophrastus, ''[[On Stones]]'' was cited as a source on [[ores]] and [[minerals]]. Pliny strove to use all the Greek histories available to him, such as Herodotus and [[Thucydides]], as well as the ''[[Bibliotheca Historica]]'' of [[Diodorus Siculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Mary Beagon, ''Roman Nature: The Thought of Pliny the Elder'', Clarendon Press (1992), ''s.v.''; Trevor Murphy, ''Pliny the Elder's Natural History: The Empire in the Encyclopedia'', OUP (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;196–200 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working method===

His nephew, Pliny the Younger, described the method that Pliny used to write the ''Natural History'':&lt;ref name=letterV&gt;Pliny the Younger. Book 3, Letter V. ''[http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_plinyltrs3.htm To Baebius Macer].'' in "Letters of Pliny the Younger" with introduction by John B. Firth.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Does it surprise you that a busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the [[Volcanalia|Festival of Vulcan]], not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave him in the middle of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian&amp;nbsp;– for he too was a night-worker&amp;nbsp;– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pliny the Younger told the following anecdote illustrating his uncle's enthusiasm for study:
&lt;ref name=letterV/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After dinner a book would be read aloud, and he would take notes in a cursory way.  I remember that one of his friends, when the reader pronounced a word wrongly, checked him and made him read it again, and my uncle said to him, "Did you not catch the meaning?" When his friend said "yes," he remarked, "Why then did you make him turn back?  We have lost more than ten lines through your interruption."  So jealous was he of every moment lost.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Style===
Pliny's writing style emulates that of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Trevor Murphy, ''Pliny the Elder's Natural History: The Empire in the Encyclopedia'', OUP (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;181–197.&lt;/ref&gt; It aims less at clarity and vividness than at [[epigrammatic]] point. It contains many [[antitheses]], questions, exclamations, [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]], [[metaphor]]s, and other [[mannerism]]s of the [[Silver Age of Latin Literature|Silver Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. P. L. Chambers, ''The Natural Histories of Pliny the Elder: An Advanced Reader and Grammar Review'', University of Oklahoma Press (2012), ''s.v.'', and Latin [[syntax]] in Pliny; see also Roger French &amp; Frank Greenaway, ''Science in the Early Roman Empire: Pliny the Elder, his Sources and Influence'', Croom Helm (1986), pp.&amp;nbsp;23–44.&lt;/ref&gt; His sentence structure is often loose and straggling. There is heavy use of the [[Latin grammar#Ablative absolute|ablative absolute]], and [[ablative]] phrases are often appended in a kind of vague "apposition" to express the author's own opinion of an immediately previous statement, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XXXV:80&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote lang="la" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;dixit (Apelles)&amp;nbsp;... uno se praestare, quod manum de tabula sciret tollere, memorabili praecepto nocere saepe nimiam diligentiam.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This might be translated

{{quote|In one thing Apelles stood out, namely, knowing when he had put enough work into a painting, a salutary warning that too much effort can be counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, 2004. page 331 (translation of XXXV:80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Everything from "a salutary warning" onwards represents the ablative absolute phrase starting with "memorabili praecepto".

==Publication history==

===First publication===

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] wrote the first ten books in AD 77, and was engaged on revising the rest during the two remaining years of his life. The work was probably published with little revision by the author's nephew Pliny the Younger, who, when telling the story of a tame dolphin and describing the [[floating island (fiction)|floating islands]] of the [[Lake Vadimo|Vadimonian Lake]] thirty years later,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Younger]], ''Letters, [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny8.html#20 8.20], [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny9.html#33 9.33]&lt;/ref&gt; has apparently forgotten that both are to be found in his uncle's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Pliny the Elder | title=Natural History | chapter=II:209, IX:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the ''Naturalis Historia'' as a ''Naturae historia'' and characterises it as a "work that is learned and full of matter, and as varied as nature herself."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Younger]], ''Letters, [http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny3.html#5 3.5]; see also ''[http://digilander.libero.it/mmarcoccio/ The True Story of Lake Vadimo]'' {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of the author's final revision may explain many errors, including why the text is as John Healy writes "disjointed, discontinuous and not in a logical order";&lt;ref&gt;Healy, 2004.  Translator's Note:xliii&lt;/ref&gt; and as early as 1350, [[Petrarch]] complained about the corrupt state of the text, referring to copying errors made between the ninth and eleventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, 2004. Introduction:xxxviii-xxxix&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscripts===

[[File:Histoire Naturelle Pline l Ancien mid 12th century Abbaye de Saint Vincent Le Mans France.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The ''Natural History'' of Pliny in a mid-12th-century manuscript from the Abbaye de Saint Vincent, [[Le Mans]], France]]

About the middle of the 3rd century, an abstract of the geographical portions of Pliny's work was produced by [[Solinus]]. Early in the 8th century, [[Bede]], who admired Pliny's work, had access to a partial manuscript  which he used in his "De Rerum Natura", especially the sections on [[meteorology]] and [[Gemstone|gems]]. However, Bede updated and corrected Pliny on the [[tides]].&lt;ref&gt;Healy, 2004. Introduction:xxxvi-xxxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

There are about 200 extant manuscripts, but the best of the more ancient manuscripts, that at [[Bamberg State Library]], contains only books XXXII–XXXVII. In 1141 [[Robert of Cricklade]] wrote the ''Defloratio Historiae Naturalis Plinii Secundi'' consisting of nine books of selections taken from an ancient manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, 2004. Introduction:xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printed copies===

The work was one of the first classical manuscripts to be [[printed]], at Venice in 1469 by [[Johann and Wendelin of Speyer]], but J.F. Healy described the translation as "distinctly imperfect".&lt;ref name="Healy39"/&gt; A copy printed in 1472 by [[Nicolas Jenson]] of Venice is held in the library at [[Wells Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Church | first=C.M. | title=Historical traditions at Wells, 1464, 1470, 1497. | journal=[[The Archaeological Journal]]| year=1904 | volume=61 | issue=11 | url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-1132-1/dissemination/pdf/061/061_155_180.pdf | pages=155–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics==

The ''Natural History'' is generally divided into the organic plants and animals and the inorganic matter, although there are frequent digressions in each section.{{efn|Compare structure at [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/home.html LacusCurtius], with footnotes.}} The encyclopedia also notes the uses made of all of these by the Romans. Its description of metals and minerals is valued for its detail in the [[history of science]], being the most extensive compilation still available from the ancient world.

Book I serves as Pliny's preface, explaining his approach and providing a table of contents.

===Astronomy===
[[File:HipparchusConstruction.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.8|How [[Hipparchus]] found the distances to [[sun]] and [[moon]]]]

The first topic covered is Astronomy, in Book II. Pliny starts with the known universe, roundly criticising attempts at cosmology as madness, including the view that there are countless other worlds than the Earth. He doubts the four (Aristotelian) elements, fire, earth, air and water,&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:10&lt;/ref&gt; but records the seven "planets" including the sun and moon.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:28-51&lt;/ref&gt; The earth is a sphere, suspended in the middle of space.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:5-6, 10&lt;/ref&gt; He considers it a weakness to try to find the shape and form of God,&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:14&lt;/ref&gt; or to suppose that such a being would care about human affairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:20&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions eclipses, but considers [[Hipparchus]]'s almanac grandiose for seeming to know how Nature works.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:24&lt;/ref&gt; He cites [[Posidonius]]'s estimate that the moon is 230,000 miles away.{{efn|Posidonius's figure was accurate: the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|distance to the moon]] varies between 221,500 miles at perigee to 252,700 miles at apogee.}} He describes [[comet]]s, noting that only Aristotle has recorded seeing more than one at once.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' I:89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

Book II continues with natural meteorological events lower in the sky, including the winds, weather, whirlwinds, lightning, and rainbows.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:119-153&lt;/ref&gt; He returns to astronomical facts such as the effect of longitude on time of sunrise and sunset,&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:181&lt;/ref&gt; the variation of the sun's elevation with latitude (affecting timetelling by sundials),&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:182&lt;/ref&gt; and the variation of day length with latitude.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:186-187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geography===

In Books III to VI, Pliny moves to the Earth itself. In Book III he covers the geography of the Iberian peninsula and Italy; Book IV covers Europe including Britain; Book V looks at Africa and Asia, while Book VI looks eastwards to the Black Sea, India and the Far East.

===Anthropology===

Book VII discusses the human race, covering [[anthropology]] and [[ethnography]], aspects of human [[physiology]] and assorted matters such as the greatness of [[Julius Caesar]], outstanding people such as [[Hippocrates]] and [[Asclepiades of Bithynia|Asclepiades]], happiness and fortune.

===Zoology===

[[File:MANA - Bernstein.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A collection of Roman amber from the Archeological Museum of Aquileia]]

Zoology is discussed in Books VIII to XI. The encyclopedia mentions different sources of purple dye, particularly the [[murex]] snail, the highly prized source of [[Tyrian purple]]. It describes the [[elephant]] and [[hippopotamus]] in detail, as well as the value and origin of the [[pearl]] and the invention of [[fish farming]] and [[oyster farming]]. The keeping of [[aquarium]]s was a popular pastime of the rich, and Pliny provides anecdotes of the problems of owners becoming too closely attached to their fish.

Pliny correctly identifies the origin of [[amber]] as the fossilised [[resin]] of pine trees. Evidence cited includes the fact that some samples exhibit encapsulated insects, a feature readily explained by the presence of a viscous resin. Pliny refers to the way in which it exerts a charge when rubbed, a property well known to Theophrastus. He devotes considerable space to [[bees]], which he admires for their industry, organisation, and [[honey]], discussing the significance of the [[queen bee]] and the use of smoke by [[beekeepers]] at the hive to collect [[honeycomb]]. He praises the song of the [[nightingale]].

===Botany===

[[Botany]] is handled in Books XII to XVIII, with Theophrastus as one of Pliny's sources. The manufacture of [[papyrus]] and the various grades of papyrus available to Romans are described. Different types of trees and the properties of their wood are explained in Books XII to XIII. The vine, viticulture and varieties of grape are discussed in Book XIV, while Book XV covers the [[olive]] tree in detail,&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XV:1-34&lt;/ref&gt; followed by other trees including the apple and pear,&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XV:47-54&lt;/ref&gt; fig,&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XV:68-78&lt;/ref&gt; cherry,&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XV:102-104&lt;/ref&gt; [[Myrtus|myrtle]] and [[laurus nobilis|laurel]],&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XV:119-138&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Pliny gives special attention to spices, such as [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[ginger]], and [[cane sugar]]. He mentions different varieties of pepper, whose values are comparable with that of gold and silver, while sugar is noted only for its medicinal value.

He is critical of [[perfume]]s: "Perfumes are the most pointless of luxuries, for pearls and jewels are at least passed on to one's heirs, and clothes last for a time, but perfumes lose their fragrance and perish as soon as they are used." He gives a summary of their ingredients, such as [[attar of roses]], which he says is the most widely used base. Other substances added include [[myrrh]], [[cinnamon]], and [[amyris|balsam]] gum.

===Drugs, medicine and magic===

A major section of the ''Natural History'', Books XX to XXIX, discusses matters related to medicine, especially plants that yield useful drugs. Pliny lists over 900 drugs, compared to 600 in [[Dioscorides]]'s ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', 550 in Theophrastus, and 650 in [[Galen]].&lt;ref&gt;Healy, 2004. Introduction:xxix&lt;/ref&gt;
The poppy and [[opium]] are mentioned; Pliny notes that opium induces sleep and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XX:198-200&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases and their treatment are covered in book XXVI.

Pliny addresses [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] in Book XXX. He is critical of the Magi, attacking [[astrology]], and suggesting that magic originated in medicine, creeping in by pretending to offer health. He names [[Zoroaster]] of [[Ancient Persia]] as the source of magical ideas. He states that [[Pythagoras]], [[Empedocles]], [[Democritus]] and [[Plato]] all travelled abroad to learn magic, remarking that it was surprising anyone accepted the doctrines they brought back, and that medicine (of Hippocrates) and magic (of Democritus) should have flourished simultaneously at the time of the [[Peloponnesian War]].

===Agriculture===
[[File:Mähmaschine.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of a relief depicting a [[Gallo-Roman]] harvesting machine]]&lt;!--NOTE: if reorganizing, note that this image goes with the following section--&gt;
{{further|Roman agriculture|List of Roman watermills}}

The methods used to cultivate crops are described in Book XVIII. He praises [[Cato the Elder]] and his work ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'', which he uses as a primary source. Pliny's work includes discussion of all known cultivated crops and vegetables, as well as herbs and remedies derived from them. He describes machines used in cultivation and processing the crops. For example, he describes a simple mechanical [[reaper]] that cut the ears of wheat and [[barley]] without the straw and was pushed by oxen (Book XVIII, chapter 72). It is depicted on a [[bas-relief]] found at [[Trier]] from the later Roman period. He also describes how grain is ground using a pestle, a hand-mill, or a mill driven by [[water wheel]]s, as found in [[List of Roman watermills|Roman water mill]]s across the Empire.{{efn|Extant mills found at [[Barbegal]] in southern France use water supplied by the [[Roman aqueducts|aqueduct]] supplying [[Arles]], powering at least sixteen overshot water wheels arranged in two parallel sets of eight down the hillside. It is thought that the wheels were overshot water wheels with the outflow from the top driving the next one down in the set, and so on to the base of the hill. Vertical water mills were known to the Romans, being described by [[Vitruvius]] in his ''[[De Architectura]]'' of 25&amp;nbsp;BC.}}

===Metallurgy===

Pliny extensively discusses metals starting with gold and silver (Book XXXIII), and then the base metals copper, [[mercury (element)|mercury]], lead, [[tin]] and iron, as well as their many alloys such as [[electrum]], [[bronze]], [[pewter]], and steel (Book XXXIV).

He is critical of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of [[Midas]] and [[Croesus]]. He discusses why gold is unique in its [[malleability]] and [[ductility]], far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine [[foil (metal)|foil]] with just one ounce, producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold [[wire]] can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He once saw [[Agrippina the Younger]], wife of Claudius, at a public show on the [[Fucine Lake]] involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of [[Himalayan marmot|Indian gold obtained by ants]] or dug up by [[griffin]]s in [[Scythia]].

[[Silver]], he writes, does not occur in native form and has to be mined, usually occurring with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by [[Hannibal]]. One of the largest had galleries running up to two miles into the mountain, while men worked day and night draining the mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]s operated by treadmill and found in Roman mines. Britain, he says, is very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus very easy to extract; production was so high that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining.

[[File:Rmcoinmolds.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25&lt;!--size very low image to roughly normal area--&gt;|Roman coins were struck, not cast, so these coin moulds were created for forgery.]]

Fraud and forgery are described in detail; in particular [[coin counterfeiting]] by mixing copper with silver, or even admixture with iron. Tests had been developed for [[counterfeit coin]]s and proved very popular with the victims, mostly ordinary people. He deals with the liquid metal mercury, also found in [[silver mine]]s. He records that it is toxic, and [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgamates]] with gold, so is used for refining and extracting that metal. He says mercury is used for [[gilding]] copper, while [[antimony]] is found in silver mines and is used as an [[eyebrow]] [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]].

The main ore of mercury is [[cinnabar]], long used as a pigment by painters. He says that the colour is similar to ''scolecium'', probably the [[Kermes (dye)|kermes insect]].{{efn|[[John Gerard]]'s influential ''Herball'' (1597) called ''scolecium'' "Maggot berrie" and supposed "Cutchonele" ([[Cochineal]]) to be a form of this. Many later authors have copied Gerard in this error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenfield|first1=Amy Butler|title=A Perfect Red: Empire, Espionage And The Quest For The Colour Of Desire|date=2011|publisher=Random House|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The dust is very toxic, so workers handling the material wear face masks of bladder skin. Copper and bronze are, says Pliny, most famous for their use in statues including colossi, gigantic statues as tall as towers, the most famous being the [[Colossus of Rhodes]]. He personally saw the massive statue of [[Nero]] in Rome, which was removed after the emperor's death. The face of the statue was modified shortly after Nero's death during Vespasian's reign, to make it a statue of Sol. [[Hadrian]] moved it, with the help of the architect Decrianus and 24 elephants, to a position next to the [[Flavian Amphitheatre]] (now called the [[Colosseum]]).

Pliny gives a special place to iron, distinguishing the hardness of steel from what is now called [[wrought iron]], a softer grade. He is scathing about the use of iron in warfare.

===Mineralogy===

[[File:Intaglio Nero CdM.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amethyst]] [[Intaglio (jewellery)|intaglio]] (1st century CE) depicting [[Nero]] as [[Apollo]] playing the lyre ''([[Cabinet des Médailles]])'']]

In the last two books of the work (Books XXXVI and XXXVII), Pliny describes many different [[minerals]] and [[gemstone]]s, building on works by Theophrastus and other authors. The topic concentrates on the most valuable gemstones, and he criticises the obsession with luxury products such as [[engraved gem]]s and [[hardstone carving]]s. He provides a thorough discussion of the properties of [[fluorspar]], noting that it is carved into vases and other decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XXXVII:18-22&lt;/ref&gt; The account of magnetism includes the myth of [[Magnes the shepherd]].

Pliny moves into [[crystallography]] and [[mineralogy]], describing the [[octahedral]] shape of the diamond and recording that diamond dust is used by gem engravers to cut and polish other gems, owing to its great [[hardness]].&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XXXVII:55-60&lt;/ref&gt; He states that [[rock crystal]] is valuable for its transparency and hardness, and can be carved into vessels and implements. He relates the story of a woman who owned a ladle made of the mineral, paying the sum of 150,000 [[sesterces]] for the item. Nero deliberately broke two crystal cups when he realised that he was about to be deposed, so denying their use to anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XXXVII:23-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny returns to the problem of fraud and the detection of false gems using several tests, including the scratch test, where counterfeit gems can be marked by a steel file, and genuine ones not. Perhaps it refers to glass imitations of jewellery gemstones. He refers to using one hard mineral to scratch another, presaging the [[Mohs hardness scale]]. Diamond sits at the top of the series because, Pliny says, it will scratch all other minerals.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XXXVII:196-200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art history===

{{further|Roman sculpture|Ancient Greek sculpture}}
Pliny's chapters on [[Roman art|Roman]] and [[Greek art]] are especially valuable because his work is virtually the only classical source of information on the subject.&lt;ref name=Isager16/&gt;

In the [[history of art]], the original Greek authorities are [[Duris of Samos]], [[Xenocrates of Sicyon]], and [[Antigonus of Carystus]]. The anecdotic element has been ascribed to Duris (XXXIV:61); the notices of the successive developments of art and the list of workers in bronze and painters to Xenocrates; and a large amount of miscellaneous information to Antigonus. Both Xenocrates and Antigonus are named in connection with [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius|Parrhasius]] (XXXV:68), while Antigonus is named in the indexes of XXXIII–XXXIV as a writer on the art of embossing metal, or working it in ornamental [[relief]] or [[Intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]].

Greek [[epigram]]s contribute their share in Pliny's descriptions of pictures and statues. One of the minor authorities for books XXXIV–XXXV is [[Heliodorus of Athens]], the author of a work on the monuments of [[Athens]]. In the indices to XXXIII–XXXVI, an important place is assigned to [[Pasiteles]] of Naples, the author of a work in five volumes on famous works of art (XXXVI:40), probably incorporating the substance of the earlier Greek treatises; but Pliny's indebtedness to Pasiteles is denied by [[August Kalkmann|Kalkmann]], who holds that Pliny used the chronological work of [[Apollodorus of Athens]], as well as a current catalogue of artists. Pliny's knowledge of the Greek authorities was probably mainly due to Varro, whom he often quotes (e.g. XXXIV:56, XXXV:173, 156, XXXVI:17, 39, 41).

[[File:Laocoon Pio-Clementino Inv1059-1064-1067.jpg|thumb|''[[Laocoön and his Sons]]'']]

For a number of items relating to works of art near the coast of [[Asia Minor]] and in the adjacent islands, Pliny was indebted to the general, statesman, orator and historian [[Mucianus|Gaius Licinius Mucianus]], who died before 77. Pliny mentions the works of art collected by Vespasian in the [[Temple of Peace, Rome|Temple of Peace]] and in his other galleries (XXXIV:84), but much of his information about the position of such works in Rome is from books, not personal observation. The main merit of his account of ancient art, the only classical work of its kind, is that it is a compilation ultimately founded on the lost textbooks of [[Xenocrates]] and on the biographies of [[Duris of Samos|Duris]] and Antigonus.&lt;ref&gt;On these, compare [http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates ''Dictionary of Art Historians''], ''s.v.'' "Xenocrates"; [[Andrew Dalby|A. Dalby]], "The Curriculum Vitae of Duris of Samos" in ''Classical Quarterly'' new series vol. 41 (1991) pp. 539–541; D. Bowder, "Duris of Samos" in ''Who Was Who in the Greek World'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1982) pp. 101–102; Reinhold Köpke, [https://archive.org/details/deantigonocaryst00kpke ''De Antigono Carystio'' (1862)], in [[Latin language|Latin]], ''Caput'' II.1.26,47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In several passages, he gives proof of independent observation (XXXIV:38, 46, 63, XXXV:17, 20, 116 seq.). He prefers the marble ''[[Laocoön and his Sons]]'' in the palace of Titus (widely believed to be the statue that is now in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]) to all the pictures and bronzes in the world (XXXVI:37). The statue is attributed by Pliny to three sculptors from the island of Rhodes: [[Agesander of Rhodes|Agesander]], Athenodoros (possibly son of Agesander) and Polydorus.

In the temple near the [[Flaminian Circus]], Pliny admires the [[Ares]] and the [[Aphrodite]] of [[Scopas]], "which would suffice to give renown to any other spot". He adds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At Rome indeed the works of art are legion; besides, one effaces another from the memory and, however beautiful they may be, we are distracted by the overpowering claims of duty and business; for to admire art we need leisure and profound stillness (XXXVI:27).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mining===

{{further|Roman mining|Roman aqueduct}}
[[File:Panorámica de Las Médulas.jpg|thumb|The striking landscape of [[Las Médulas]], the most important gold mine in the Roman Empire, resulted from the [[Las Médulas#Mining technique|''Ruina Montium'' mining technique]].]]

Pliny provides lucid descriptions of [[Roman mining]]. He describes [[gold mining]] in detail,&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' XXXIII:36-81&lt;/ref&gt; with large-scale use of water to scour alluvial gold deposits. The description probably refers to mining in Northern Spain, especially at the large [[Las Médulas]] site. {{efn|It is likely that Pliny, as a [[Promagistrate|Procurator]] in [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], saw the operations of gold extraction himself, since the sections in Book XXXIII read like an [[Witness|eye witness]] report.}}{{efn|Pliny's work supplements the ''[[De Architectura]]'' of [[Vitruvius]], who describes many machines used in mining.}} Pliny describes methods of underground mining, including the use of [[fire-setting]] to attack the gold-bearing rock and so extract the ore. In another part of his work, Pliny describes the use of [[Underground mining#Mining techniques|undermining]]{{efn|See David Bird's analysis of Pliny's use of water power in mining.&lt;ref name=Bird-Arrugia&gt;[http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2015-4&amp;5%20-%20Pliny's%20Arrugia%20-%20Water%20Power%20in%20Roman%20Gold-Mining.pdf "Pliny's Arrugia Water Power in Roman Gold-Mining"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328192743/http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2015-4%265%20-%20Pliny%27s%20Arrugia%20-%20Water%20Power%20in%20Roman%20Gold-Mining.pdf |date=28 March 2012 }}, by David Bird, in ''Mining History'' Vol. 15, Nos. 4/5 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;}} to gain access to the veins.{{efn|This probably refers to opencast rather than underground mining, given the dangers to the miners in confined spaces.}} Pliny was scathing about the search for precious metals and gemstones: "Gangadia or [[quartzite]] is considered the hardest of all things&amp;nbsp;– except for the greed for gold, which is even more stubborn."{{efn|"...est namque terra ex quodam argillae genere glarea mixta — 'gangadiam' vocant — prope inexpugnabilis. cuneis eam ferreis adgrediuntur et isdem malleis nihilque durius putant, nisi quod inter omnia auri fames durissima est [...]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/33*.html#21 ''N.H.'' xxi-72].&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|See also Bird on mining at Arrugia.&lt;ref name=Bird-Arrugia/&gt;}}

Book XXXIV covers the base metals, their uses and their extraction.

The anonymous fourth-century compilation ''[[Medicina Plinii]]'' contains more than 1,100 [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] recipes, the vast majority of them from the ''Historia naturalis''; perhaps because Pliny's name was attached to it, it enjoyed huge popularity in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="D.R.

In this regard, Pliny's influence over the medieval period has been argued to be quite extensive. For example. one twentieth century historian has argued that Pliny's reliance on book-based knowledge, and not direct observation, shaped intellectual life to the degree that it  "stymie[d] the progress of western science".{{sfn|Doody|2010|page=31}} This sentintment can be observed in the early modern period when [[Niccolò Leoniceno]]'s 1509 ''De Erroribus Plinii'' ("On Pliny's Errors") attacked Pliny for lacking a proper scientific method, unlike Theophrastus or Dioscorides, and for lacking knowledge of philosophy or medicine.&lt;ref name="Healy39"/&gt;

Sir [[Thomas Browne]] expressed scepticism about Pliny's dependability in his 1646 ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Available at the [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo18.html#b15] University of Chicago site&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Now what is very strange, there is scarce a popular error passant in our days, which is not either directly expressed, or diductively contained in this Work; which being in the hands of most men, hath proved a powerful occasion of their propagation. Wherein notwithstanding the credulity of the Reader is more condemnable then the curiosity of the Author: for commonly he nameth the Authors from whom he received those accounts, and writes but as he reads, as in his Preface to Vespasian he acknowledgeth.}}

===Modern===

Grundy Steiner of Northwestern University, in a 1955 judgement considered by Thomas R. Laehn to represent the collective opinion of Pliny's critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Pliny's Defense of Empire | publisher=Routledge | author=Laehn, Thomas R | year=2013 | page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote of Pliny that "He was not an original, creative thinker, nor a pioneer of research to be compared either with Aristotle and Theophrastus or with any of the great moderns. He was, rather, the compiler of a secondary sourcebook."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Skepticism of the Elder Pliny | author=Steiner, Grundy | journal=Classical Weekly | year=1955 | volume=48 | pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian author [[Italo Calvino]], in his 1991 book ''Why Read the Classics?'', wrote that while people often consult Pliny's ''Natural History'' for facts and curiosities, he is an author who "deserves an extended read, for the measured movement of his prose, which is enlivened by his admiration for everything that exists and his respect for the infinite diversity of all phenomena".&lt;ref name=Calvino&gt;{{cite book | title=Why Read the Classics? | publisher=Penguin (Modern Classics) | author=Calvino, Italo | year=2009 | pages=37–46 | isbn=978-0-14-118970-3}}(First published as ''Perché leggere i classici'', Mondadori, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Calvino notes that while Pliny is eclectic, he was not uncritical, though his evaluations of sources are inconsistent and unpredictable. Further, Calvino compares Pliny to [[Immanuel Kant]], in that God is prevented by logic from conflicting with reason, even though (in Calvino's view) Pliny makes a pantheistic identification of God as being immanent in nature. As for destiny, Calvino writes:
{{quote|sign=|source=|it is impossible to force that variable which is destiny into the natural history of man: this is the sense of the pages that Pliny devotes to the vicissitudes of fortune, to the unpredictability of the length of any life, to the pointlessness of astrology, to disease and death.&lt;ref name=Calvino/&gt;}}

The art historian Jacob Isager writes in the introduction to his analysis of Pliny's chapters on art in the ''Natural History'' that his intention is:&lt;blockquote&gt;to show how Pliny in his encyclopedic work – which is the result of adaptations from many earlier writers and according to Pliny himself was intended as a reference work – nevertheless throughout expresses a basic attitude to Man and his relationship with Nature; how he understands Man's role as an inventor ("scientist and artist"); and finally his attitude to the use and abuse of Nature's and Man's creations, to progress and decay.&lt;ref name="Isager16"&gt;{{cite book | title=Pliny on Art and Society: The Elder Pliny's Chapters On The History Of Art | publisher=Routledge | author=Isager, Jacob | year=2013 | page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;More specifically, Isager writes that "the guiding principle in Pliny's treatment of Greek and Roman art is the function of art in society",&lt;ref name="Isager16" /&gt; while Pliny "uses his art history to express opinions about the ideology of the state".&lt;ref name="Isager16" /&gt;

Paula Findlen, writing in the ''Cambridge History of Science'', asserts that &lt;blockquote&gt;Natural history was an ancient form of scientific knowledge, most closely associated with the writings of the Roman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder&amp;nbsp;... His loquacious and witty ''Historia naturalis'' offered an expansive definition of this subject. [It] broadly described all entities found in nature, or derived from nature, that could be seen in the Roman world and read about in its books: art, artifacts, and peoples as well as animals, plants, and minerals were included in his project.&lt;ref name="Findlen"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kvjAp92zcYC | title=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Findlen, Paula; edited by Roy Porter, Katharine Park and Lorraine Daston  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2006 | page=437 | work=Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Findlen contrasts Pliny's approach with that of his intellectual predecessors Aristotle and Theophrastus, who sought general causes of natural phenomena, while Pliny was more interested in cataloguing natural wonders, and his contemporary Dioscorides explored nature for its uses in [[Roman medicine]] in his great work ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]''.&lt;ref name="Findlen" /&gt;

In the view of Mary Beagon, writing in ''The Classical Tradition'' in 2010:&lt;blockquote&gt;the ''Historia naturalis'' has regained its status to a greater extent than at any time since the advent of Humanism. Work by those with scientific as well as philological expertise has resulted in improvements both to Pliny's text and to his reputation as a scientist. The essential coherence of his enterprise has also been rediscovered, and his ambitious portrayal, in all its manifestations, of 'nature, that is, life'.. is recognized as a unique cultural record of its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Pliny the Elder | encyclopedia=The Classical Tradition | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Beagon, Mary |editor1=Grafton, Anthony |editor2=Most, Glenn W. |editor3=Settis, Salvatore | year=2010 | pages=745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Obstetrical bleeding''' is [[bleeding]] in [[pregnancy]] that occurs [[Antepartum bleeding|before]], during, or [[Postpartum bleeding|after childbirth]].&lt;ref name=Wal2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walfish |first1=M. |last2=Neuman |first2=A. |last3=Wlody |first3=D. |title=Maternal haemorrhage |journal=British Journal of Anaesthesia |date=December 2009 |volume=103 |pages=i47–i56 |doi=10.1093/bja/aep303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bleeding before childbirth is that which occurs after 24 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Wal2009/&gt; Bleeding may be vaginal or less commonly into the abdominal cavity. Bleeding which occurs before 24 weeks is known as [[early pregnancy bleeding]].

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;

==Later pregnancy==
{{main|Antepartum bleeding}}
[[Antepartum bleeding]] (APH), also prepartum hemorrhage, is bleeding during pregnancy from the 24th week&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://patient.info/doctor/antepartum-haemorrhage patient.info » PatientPlus » Antepartum Haemorrhage] Last Updated: 5 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes defined as from the 20th week&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewomens.org.au/AntepartumHaemorrhage The Royal Women’s Hospital &gt; antepartum haemorrhage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108223247/http://www.thewomens.org.au/AntepartumHaemorrhage |date=2010-01-08 }} Retrieved on Jan 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) [[gestational age]] up to the birth of the baby.&lt;ref name=St2010Ant&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stables |first1=Dorothy |last2=Rankin |first2=Jean |title=Physiology in Childbearing: With Anatomy and Related Biosciences |date=2010 |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |isbn=0702044113 |page=429 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=54_pNDdevZ8C&amp;pg=PA429 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary consideration is the presence of a [[placenta previa]] which is a low lying placenta at or very near to the internal cervical os. This condition occurs in roughly 4 out of 1000 &lt;ref name="pmid27902772"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soyama H, Miyamoto M, Ishibashi H, Takano M, Sasa H, Furuya K | title = Relation between Birth Weight and Intraoperative Hemorrhage during Cesarean Section in Pregnancy with Placenta Previa | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 11 | pages = e0167332 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27902772 | pmc = 5130260 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0167332 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pregnancies and usually needs to be resolved by delivering the baby via [[cesarean section]]. Also a placental [[abruption]] (in which there is premature separation of the placenta) can lead to obstetrical hemorrhage, sometimes concealed. This pathology is of important consideration after maternal trauma such as a motor vehicle accident or fall.

Other considerations to include when assessing antepartum bleeding are: sterile vaginal exams that are performed in order to assess dilation of the patient when the 40th week is approaching. As well as cervical insufficiency defined as a midtrimester (14th-26th week) dilation of the cervix which may need medical intervention to assist in keeping the pregnancy sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-insufficiency|title=Cervical insufficiency|last=Berghella, MD|first=Vincenzo|date=July 2017|website=UpToDate|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===During labor===
Besides placenta previa and placental abruption, [[uterine rupture]] can occur, which is a very serious condition leading to internal or external bleeding. Bleeding from the [[fetus]] is rare, but may occur with two conditions called vasa previa and velamentous umbilical cord insertion where the fetal blood vessels lie near the placental insertion site unprotected by Wharton's jelly of the cord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stage0www.uptodate.com/contents/velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa?source=search_result&amp;search=Vasa+previa&amp;selectedTitle=1~17|title=Velamentous umbilical cord insertion and vasa previa|vauthors = ((Charles J Lockwood, MD, MHCM)), ((Karen Russo-Stieglitz, MD))|date=July 2017|website=UpToDate|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally this condition can be diagnosed by ultrasound. There are also tests to differentiate maternal blood from fetal blood which can help in determining the source of the bleed.

==After delivery==
{{main|Postpartum bleeding}}
Abnormal bleeding after delivery, or postpartum hemorrhage, is the loss of greater than 500 ml of blood following vaginal delivery, or 1000 ml of blood following cesarean section. Other definitions of excessive postpartum bleeding are hemodynamic instability, drop of hemoglobin of more than 10%,&lt;ref name="pmid27050823"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Atukunda EC, Mugyenyi GR, Obua C, Atuhumuza EB, Musinguzi N, Tornes YF, Agaba AG, Siedner MJ | title = Measuring Post-Partum Haemorrhage in Low-Resource Settings: The Diagnostic Validity of Weighed Blood Loss versus Quantitative Changes in Hemoglobin | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = e0152408 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27050823 | pmc = 4822885 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0152408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or requiring blood transfusion. In the literature, primary postpartum hemorrhage is defined as uncontrolled bleeding that occurs in the first 24 hours after delivery while secondary hemorrhage occurs between 24 hours and six weeks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Global burden of maternal haemorrhage in the year 2000 Carmen Dolea1, Carla AbouZahr2 , Claudia Stein1 Evidence and Information for Policy (EIP), World Health Organization, Geneva, July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk factors ==
In rare cases, inherited bleeding disorders, like [[hemophilia]], [[von Willebrand disease]] (vWD), or [[Factor IX deficiency|factor IX]] or [[Haemophilia C|XI]] deficiency, may cause severe postpartum hemorrhage, with an increased risk of death particularly in the postpartum period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The risk of postpartum hemorrhage in patients with vWD and carriers of hemophilia has been found to be 18.5% and 22% respectively. This pathology occurs due to the normal physiological drop in maternal clotting factors after delivery which greatly increases the risk of secondary postpartum hemorrhage.&lt;ref name="pmid11251653"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kadir RA, Aledort LM | title = Obstetrical and gynaecological bleeding: a common presenting symptom | journal = Clinical and Laboratory Haematology | volume = 22 Suppl 1 | issue = | pages = 12–6; discussion 30–2 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11251653 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2000.00007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another bleeding risk factor is thrombocytopenia, or decreased platelet levels, which is the most common hematological change associated with pregnancy induced hypertension. If platelet counts drop less than 100,000 per microliter the patient will be at a severe risk for inability to clot during and after delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pregnancy and birth sourcebook|last=Aldred|first=Heather E.|publisher=health reference series|year=1997|isbn=9780780802162|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical tests ==
If a small amount of bleeding is seen in early pregnancy a physician may request:
* A quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) blood test to confirm the pregnancy or assist in diagnosing a potential miscarriage &lt;ref name="HeineSwamy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/symptoms-during-pregnancy/vaginal-bleeding-during-early-pregnancy|title=Vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy|vauthors = Heine PR, Swamy GK|date=August 2009|website=Merck Manual|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transvaginal pelvic ultrasonography to confirm that the pregnancy is not outside of the uterus&lt;ref name="HeineSwamy"/&gt;
* Blood type and Rh test to rule out [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]]&lt;ref name="HeineSwamy"/&gt;
For bleeding seen in later pregnancy tests may include:
* [[Complete blood count|Complete blood count (CBC)]] and blood type and screen &lt;ref name="HeineSwamy"/&gt;
* Ultrasound to determine placental location &lt;ref name="HeineSwamy"/&gt;
* [[Kleihauer–Betke test|Kleihauer-Betke]] (KB) test especially if there was maternal trauma &lt;ref name="HeineSwamy"/&gt;

==Unrelated bleeding==
Pregnant patients may have bleeding from the reproductive tract due to trauma, including sexual trauma, neoplasm, most commonly [[cervical cancer]], and [[hematologic disorder]]s. Molar pregnancy (also called [[Molar pregnancy|hydatiform mole]]) is a type of pregnancy where the sperm and the egg have joined within the uterus, but the result is a cyst resembling a grape-like cluster rather than an embryo. Bleeding can be an early sign of this tumor developing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pregnancy and birth sourcebook|last=Aldred|first=Heather E.|publisher=Omnigraphics|year=1997|isbn=9780780802162|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8165">'''Orthoptics''' is a profession allied to eye care profession whose primary emphasis is the diagnosis and non-surgical management of strabismus (wandering eye), amblyopia (lazy eye) and eye movement disorders.&lt;ref name="IOA"&gt;International Orthoptic Association document "professional role"&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''orthoptics'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ὀρθός ''orthos'', "straight" and ὀπτικός ''optikοs'', "relating to sight" and much of the practice of orthoptists concerns refraction and muscular eye control.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcos.ca/about_orthoptics.html&lt;/ref&gt; Orthoptists are trained professionals who specialize in orthoptic treatment.  With specific training, in some countries orthoptists may be involved in monitoring of some forms of eye disease, such as glaucoma, cataract screening and diabetic retinopathy &lt;ref name="Vukicevic"&gt;Vukicevic, M., Koklanis, K and Giribaldi, M. ''Orthoptics: Evolving to meet increasing demand for eye service''. In Insight news. March 2013: Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
For children, there is evidence that orthoptics can be more effective at treating convergence insufficiency than home-based training; for adults the evidence is not consistent.&lt;ref name=cc&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scheiman M, Gwiazda J, Li T |title=Non-surgical interventions for convergence insufficiency |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=3 |pages=CD006768 |year=2011 |pmid=21412896 |pmc=4278667 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006768.pub2 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Orthoptics has a long history in supporting ophthalmic care. French ophthalmologist Louis Emile Javal, began using ocular exercises to treat strabismus (wandering eye) and described the practice of orthoptics in his writings in the late 19th century. Mary Maddox pioneered the orthoptic profession and was the first documented orthoptist. She was trained by her father, Ernest E. Maddox, in response to increasing patient demand and time needed to examine and treat patients. Dr [[Ernest Maddox]] was a reputed ophthalmologist as well as the inventor of various instruments for investigating binocular vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orthoptie.net/histoire/bios/maddox.htm|title=Ernest Edmund Maddox (1863 - 1933)|date=2006-06-03|accessdate=2014-09-17|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Maddox started her own practice in London in the early 1920s and her first hospital clinic opened at the Royal Westminster Hospital in 1928.&lt;ref name="Vukicevic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Helveston"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Helveston | first1 = EM | title = Visual training: current status in ophthalmology | journal = American Journal of Ophthalmology | volume = 140 | issue = 5 | pages = 903–10 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16310470 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajo.2005.06.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Australian hospital clinic with orthoptists was established at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne in 1931.

==Current orthoptic practice==
Orthoptists are mainly involved with diagnosing and managing patients with binocular vision disorders which relate to [[amblyopia]], [[extraocular muscle]] balance such as with [[version (eye)|version]], [[refractive|refractive errors]], [[vergence]], accommodation imbalances, ([[positive relative accommodation]] and [[negative relative accommodation]]). They work closely with ophthalmologists to ensure that patients with eye muscle disorders are offered a full range of treatment options. According to the [[International Orthoptic Association]], professional orthoptic practice involves the following:&lt;ref name="internationalorthoptics.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalorthoptics.org/download/1160331924_3.1._pr_01_rev_06.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731141108/http://www.internationalorthoptics.org/download/1160331924_3.1._pr_01_rev_06.doc |archivedate=July 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Knox''', {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|FRCSE]] [[Member of the Wernerian Society|MWS]]}} (4 September 1791 – 20 December 1862), was a Scottish [[Anatomy|anatomist]], [[Zoology|zoologist]], [[Ethology|ethologist]] and [[physician|physician.]] He was a lecturer on anatomy in Britain, where he introduced the theory of [[transcendental anatomy]]. However, he is now mainly remembered for his involvement in the [[Burke and Hare murders]]. Difficulty in obtaining cadavers for dissection after the passage of the [[Anatomy Act 1832|Anatomy Act]] and disagreements with professional colleagues ruined his career. A move to London did not improve matters. His later pessimistic view of humanity contrasted sharply with his youthful attachment to the ideas of [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]].

Knox devoted the latter part of his life to theorising on evolution and [[ethnology]]. His work on the latter harmed his legacy and overshadowed his contributions to [[evolutionary theory]].

== Life ==

===Early life===
Robert Knox was born in 1791&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; in Edinburgh's North Richmond Street, the eighth child of Mary (née Scherer) and Robert Knox (d. 1812), a teacher of mathematics and [[natural philosophy]] at [[Heriot's Hospital]] in Edinburgh. As an infant, he contracted [[smallpox]], which destroyed his left eye and disfigured his face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bates|first1=A.

He won the [[Lord Provost|Lord Provost's]] gold medal in his final year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lonsdale|first1=Henry|title=A Sketch of the Life and Writings of Robert Knox, the Anatomist|date=1870|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|location=London|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810, he joined medical classes at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He soon became interested in transcendentalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knox|first1=Robert|title=Contributions to the philosophy of zoology, with special reference to the natural history of man|journal=Lancet|date=1855|volume=2|pages=24–6, 45–6, 68–71, 162–4, 186–8, 216–18|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)53494-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[Xavier Bichat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knox|first1=Robert|title=Xavier Bichat: his life and labours; a biographical and philosophical study|journal=Lancet|date=1854|volume=2|pages=393–6|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)54763-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was twice president of the Royal Physical Society, an undergraduate club to which he presented papers on hydrophobia and [[nosology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bates|first1=A.

Knox joined the "extramural" anatomy class of the famous [[John Barclay (anatomist)|John Barclay]]. Barclay was an anatomist of the highest distinction, and perhaps the greatest anatomical teacher in Britain at that time. Redoubling his efforts, Knox passed competently the second time around.

Knox graduated Adiya from the University of Edinburgh in 1814, with a Latin thesis on the effects of [[Narcotic|narcotics]] which was published the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knox|first1=Robert|title=On the relations subsisting between the time of the day, and various functions of the human body; and on the manner in which the pulsations of the heart and arteries are affected by muscular exertion|journal=Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal|date=1815|volume=11|pages=52–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the army and was commissioned Hospital Assistant on 24 June 1815, after having studied for a year under [[John Abernethy (surgeon)|John Abernethy]] at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] in [[London]]. He was sent immediately to [[Belgium]] to attend the wounded from the [[Battle of Waterloo]] and returned two weeks later with the first batch of wounded aboard a hospital ship; during the voyage he successfully employed Abernethy's technique of leaving wounds open to the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knox|first1=Robert|title=Contributions to surgical anatomy and operative surgery|journal=Lancet|date=1856|volume=1|pages=35–6, 535–7|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(02)55284-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His army work at the [[Brussels]] military hospital (near Waterloo) impressed upon him the need for a comprehensive training in anatomy if surgery were to be successful. Knox was  intelligent, critical and irritable. He did not suffer fools gladly and—in an aside with terrible consequences for his future career—he was critical of the surgical work of [[Charles Bell]] with casualties at the Battle of Waterloo. After a further trip to Belgium he was placed in charge of Hilsea hospital near [[Portsmouth]], where he experimented with non-mercurial cures for syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bacot|first1=John|title=Essays on syphilis|journal=London Medical Gazette|date=1828|volume=2|pages=289–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1817, he joined the [[72nd Regiment, Duke of Albany's Own Highlanders|72nd Highlanders]] and sailed with them to [[South Africa]]. There were few army surgeons in the Cape Colony but Knox found the people healthy and his duties were light. He enjoyed riding, shooting and the beauty of the landscape with which he felt in spiritual harmony—an early expression of his transcendental world view.&lt;ref name=knox1850 &gt;{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=Robert|title=The Races of Men: a Fragment|date=1850|publisher=Henry Renshaw|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox developed an interest in observing racial types, and disapproved of what he saw as the [[Boer|Boers]]' contempt for the indigenous peoples. However, after an abortive Xhosa rebellion against the colonial forces, he was involved in a retaliatory raid commanded by [[Andries Stockenström]], a magistrate and future Lieutenant Governor.&lt;ref name=knox1850 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutton|first1=C.W.|title=The Autobiography of the Late Sir Andries Stockenström, Bart...|date=1887|publisher=J.C. Juta and Co.|location=Cape Town|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations with Stockenström were marred when Knox accused O. G. Stockenström, Andries' brother, of theft, a charge apparently prompted by ill feeling between British and Boer officers. A court martial acquitted O. G. of the charge and Andries called Knox's conduct shameful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutton|first1=C.W.|title=The Autobiography of the Late Sir Andries Stockenström, Bart...|date=1887|publisher=J. C. Juta and Co.|location=Cape Town|pages=161–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Stockenström's supporters, a former naval officer named Burdett, challenged Knox to a duel. Knox initially refused to fight, and Burdett "soundly horse whipped him on the parade before every Officer of the Garrison." Knox then grabbed a sabre and inflicted a slight wound to Burdett's arm. Knox's promotion to Assistant Surgeon was cancelled and he returned to Britain in disgrace, arriving on Christmas Day 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bates|first1=A.W.|title=The Anatomy of Robert Knox: Murder, Mad Science and Medical Regulation in Nineteenth-Century Edinburgh|date=2010|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|location=Eastbourne|pages=39–40|isbn=978-1-84519-381-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained only until the following October, after which he went to [[Paris]] to study anatomy for just over a year (1821–22). It was then that he met both [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], who were to remain heroes for his entire life, to populate his later medical journalism, and to become the subject of his [[hagiography]], ''Great artists and great anatomists''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knox|first1=Robert|title=Great Artists and Great Anatomists|date=1852|publisher=John van Voorst|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Paris he befriended [[Thomas Hodgkin]], with whom he shared a dissecting room at l'[[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Hôpital de la Pitié]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Thomas Hodgkin to John Hodgkin, Oct 1821, Wellcome Library AMS/MF/3/1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career in Edinburgh ===
[[File:Bill advertising Dr. Knox's lectures (1828).jpg|thumb|180px|Bill advertising Knox's anatomy lectures in 1828]]
Knox returned to Edinburgh by Christmas 1822. On 1 December 1823 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. During these years he communicated a number of well-received papers to the Royal and Wernerian societies of Edinburgh on zoological subjects. Soon after his election he submitted a plan to the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] for a Museum of Comparative Anatomy, which was accepted, and on 13 January 1825 he was appointed curator of the museum with a salary of £100.&lt;ref&gt;RCSEd Minute Book 1824, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1825, [[John Barclay (anatomist)|John Barclay]] offered him a partnership at his anatomy school in Surgeon's Square, Edinburgh. In order for his lectures to be recognised by the Edinburgh College of Surgeons, Knox had to be admitted to its fellowship; a formality, but, at £250, an expensive one.&lt;ref&gt;RCSEd Minute Book 19 Apr. 1825, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time most professorships were in the gift of the town council, resulting in such uninspiring teachers as the professor of anatomy [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Alexander Monro]], who put off many of his students (including the young [[Charles Darwin]] who took the course 1825–1827). This created a demand for private tuition, and the flamboyant Knox—in sole charge after Barclay's death in 1826—had more students than all the other private tutors put together.

He turned his sharp wit on the elders and the clergy of the city, satirising religion and delighting his students. Knox routinely referred to the [[Natural theology#Bridgewater Treatises|Bridgewater Treatises]] as the "bilgewater treatises" and his 'continental' lectures were not for the squeamish. [[John James Audubon]] was in Edinburgh at the time to find subscribers for his ''[[Birds of America (book)|Birds of America]]''. Shown round the dissecting theatre by Knox, "dressed in an overgown and with bloody fingers", Audubon reported that "The sights were extremely disagreeable, many of them shocking beyond all I ever thought could be. I was glad to leave this charnel house and breathe again the salubrious atmosphere of the streets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Audubon|first1=Maria R.|title=Audubon and His Journals|date=1899|publisher=C. Scribner|location=New York|pages=146, 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox's school flourished and he took on three assistants, Alexander Miller, [[Thomas Wharton Jones]], and [[William Fergusson (physician)|William Fergusson]].

===Marriage and personal life===

Little is known of Knox's wife, Susan Knox, whom he married in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilsone|first1=W.

=== West Port murders ===
{{see also|Anatomy murder}}
Before the [[Anatomy Act]] of 1832 widened the supply, the main legal supply of corpses for anatomical purposes in the UK were those condemned to death and [[dissection]] by the courts. This led to a chronic shortage of legitimate subjects for dissection, and this shortage became more serious as the need to train medical students grew, and the number of executions fell. In his school Knox ran up against the problem from the start, since—after 1815—the Royal Colleges had increased the anatomical work in the medical curriculum. If he taught according to what was known as 'French method' the ratio would have had to approach one corpse per pupil. 
[[File:Body snatchers at work, Old Crown Inn, Penicuik.JPG|thumb|190px|A modern depiction of body snatchers at work]]
As a consequence, [[body-snatching]] became so prevalent that it was not unusual for relatives and friends of someone who had just died to watch over the body until burial, and then to keep watch over the grave after burial, to stop it being violated. In November 1827 William Hare began a new career when an indebted lodger died on him by chance. He was paid £7.10s (seven pounds &amp; ten shillings) for delivering the body to Knox's dissecting rooms at Surgeons' Square. Now Hare and his accomplice William Burke set about murdering tramps and drunks on a regular basis. After 16 more transactions, in what became known as the West Port Murders, on 2 November 1828 [[Burke and Hare]] were caught, and the whole city convulsed with titillated horror, fed by ballads, broadsides and newspapers, at the terrible deeds of the pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =The Resurrectionists| work =The Resurrectionists| publisher =New York Academy of Medicine| url =http://nyam.org/library/pages/historical_collections_resurrectionists| accessdate =27 April 2008| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080509135147/http://nyam.org/library/pages/historical_collections_resurrectionists| archivedate =9 May 2008| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hare turned [[King's evidence]], and Burke was hanged, dissected and displayed.

Knox was not prosecuted, which outraged many in Edinburgh. His house was attacked by a mob of 'the lowest rabble of the Old Town,' and windows were broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Belfast News-Letter|journal=Belfast News-Letter|date=17 Feb 1829|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] exonerated him on the grounds that he had not dealt personally with Burke and Hare, but there was no forgetting his part in the case, and many remained wary of him.

Almost immediately after the Burke and Hare case, the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] began to harry him, and by June 1831 they had procured his resignation as the Curator of the museum he had proposed and founded.&lt;ref&gt;RCSEd Minute Book 1831, 502.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he was obliged to resign his army commission to avoid further service in the Cape.&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale 1870, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; This removed his last source of guaranteed income, but fortunately his classes were more popular than ever, with a record 504 students.&lt;ref&gt;Bates 2010, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; His school moved to the grander premises of Old Surgeons' Hall in 1833 but his class declined after [[Edinburgh University]] made its own practical anatomy class compulsory in the mid-1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson R. 1987.

In 1847 the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh found him guilty of falsifying a student's certificate of attendance (a not uncommon practice in private schools) and refused to accept any further certificates from him, effectively banning him from teaching in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;RCSEd Minute Book 1847, 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he was expelled from the Royal Society of Edinburgh and had his election retrospectively cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Neil|title=The Royal Society of Edinburgh (1783-1983)|date=1983|publisher=Royal Society of Edinburgh|location=Edinburgh|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robert Knox Anatomist Grave.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Knox's grave in [[Brookwood Cemetery]]]]
Knox left for London after the death of his wife (the remaining children were left with a nephew). He found it impossible to find a university post, and from then until 1856 he worked on medical journalism, gave public lectures, and wrote several books, including his most ambitious work, ''The Races of Men'' in which he argued that each race was suited to its environment and "perfect in its own way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Evelleen|title=The "moral anatomy" of Robert Knox: the interplay between biological and social thought in Victorian scientific naturalism|journal=Isis|date=1994|volume=85|pages=377–411|jstor=235460}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book about fishing sold best.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} In 1854 his son Robert died of heart disease; Knox tried for a posting to the Crimea but at 63 was judged too old.&lt;ref&gt;Bates 2010, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the medical register at its inception in 1858 and practiced obstetrics in Hackney.

Knox's interest in race began as an undergraduate.

He offered crude characterisations of each racial group: for example the Saxon (in which race he included himself) "invents nothing", "has no musical ear", lacks "genius", and is so "low and boorish" that "he does not know what you mean by fine art".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|45}} No race was without its redeeming features, however; Knox described Saxons as "[t]houghtful, plodding, industrious beyond all other races, [and] a lover of labour for labour's sake".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|45}} Such supposed racial characteristics meant that each race was naturally fitted for a particular environment and could not endure outside of it. Ultimately however, all races were "[d]estined ... to run, like all other animals, a certain limited course of existence", it mattering "little how their extinction is brought about".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|302}} In 1862 Knox took the opportunity of a second edition of ''The Races of Men'' to defend the "much maligned races" of the Cape against accusations of cannibalism, and to rebuke the Dutch for treating them like "wild beasts".&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Robert. The Races of Men: A Philosophical Enquiry into the Influence of Race over the Destinies of Nations. 2nd ed. London: Henry Renshaw, pp. 542, 546, 548-9, 563.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcendentalism ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2017}}
In his writings Knox synthesised a perspective on nature from three of the most influential natural historians of his time. From Cuvier, he took a consciousness of the great epochs of time, of the fact of extinction, and of the inadequacy of the biblical account. From Étienne Geoffroy St-Hilaire and [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville]], he gained a spatial and thematic perspective on living things. If one had the skill, all living beings could be arranged in their correct placing in a notional table, and one would see both internally and externally the elegant variation of their organs and anatomy according to the principles of connection, unity of composition and compensation.

[[Goethe]] is another crucial addition to the Knoxian way of looking at nature. Goethe thought that there were transcendental archetypes in the living world which could be perceived by genius. If the natural historian were perspicacious enough to examine the creatures in this correct order he could perceive—aesthetically—the archetype that was immanent in the totality of a series, although present in none of them.

Knox wrote that he was concerned to prove the existence of a generic animal, "or in other terms, proving hereditary descent to have a relation primarily to genus or natural family". This way, he could lay claim to a stability in the natural order at the level of the genus, but let species be extinguished. Man was a genus; not a species.

== Evolution ==
According to Richards, ''The Races of Men'' advocated "a common material origin of life and its evolution by a process of saltatory descent"; that is to say, new species arose not by gradual change but by sudden leaps due to shifts in embryonic development.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Knox tentatively concluded that "simple animals ... may have produced by continuous generation the more complex animals of after ages . . . the fish of the early world may have produced reptiles, then again birds and quadrupeds; lastly, man himself?" Newly formed species survived or perished according to external conditions, which acted as "potent checks to an infinite variety of forms". For one contemporary reviewer, his claim that "Species is the product of external circumstances, acting through millions of years" was "bold, disgusting, and gratuitous atheism." In modern terms, he proposed a theory of saltatory evolution, in which "deformations" in embryonic development produced "hopeful monsters" that, if fortuitously suited to the prevailing environmental conditions, gave rise to new species in a single, [[macroevolution]]ary leap. In 1857 he wrote: "The conversion of one of these species into another cannot be so difficult a matter with Nature, especially when all or most of the specific characters are already present in the young. Thus a given species may perish, but another of the same consanguinité takes its place in space: it is a question of time... Thus parenté extends from species to genus and from genus to class and order, in characters not to be misunderstood."

Knox is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of African lizard, ''[[Meroles|Meroles knoxii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

[[Image:River Ganges and tributaries.png|thumb|350px|Map of the [[Ganges River]] from its origin in northern [[India]] to its entry into the [[Bay of Bengal]] through [[Bangladesh]].]]

The '''sharing of the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] waters''' between [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] over the appropriate allocation and development of the water resources of the [[Ganges River]] that flows from northern India into Bangladesh. The issue has remained a subject of conflict for almost 35 years, with several bilateral agreements and rounds of talks failing to produce results.

However, a comprehensive bilateral treaty was signed by Indian Prime Minister [[H. D. Deve Gowda]] and Bangladeshi Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina Wajed]] on 12 December 1996 in the Indian capital of New Delhi. The treaty established a 30-year water-sharing arrangement and recognised Bangladesh's rights as a lower-level [[riparian]].&lt;ref name="AME"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.american.edu/ted/ice/indobang.htm |title=India-Bangladesh Water Dispute |author=Robie I.

== Background ==
[[Image:Bangladesh-en.png|right|thumb|300px|A Map showing major rivers in Bangladesh, including the [[Padma River]].]]

Descending from India's northern plains, the Ganges river forms a boundary of 129 kilometres between India and Bangladesh and flows for 113&amp;nbsp;km in Bangladesh.  At [[Pakaur]] in India, the river begins its attrition with the branching away of its first [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River|Bhagirathi River]], which goes on to form the [[Hooghly River]]. About 10 kilometres from the border with Bangladesh the [[Farakka Barrage]], built in 1974, controls the flow of the Ganges, diverting some of the water into a [[Canal|feeder canal]] linking the Hooghly to keep it relatively [[silt]]-free.&lt;ref name="IB"&gt;{{cite book |date=1989 |editor1-last=Heitzman |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Worden |editor2-first=Robert |chapter=India |chapter-url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/106.htm |title=Bangladesh: A Country Study |url=http://countrystudies.us/bangladesh/ |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |pages=188–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After entering Bangladesh, the main branch of the Ganges is known as the [[Padma River]] until it is joined by the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna River]], the largest distributary of the [[Brahmaputra River]], which descends from [[Assam]] and [[Northeast India]]. Further downstream, the Ganges is fed by the [[Meghna River]], the second-largest distributary of the Brahmaputra, and takes on the Meghna's name as it enters the Meghna estuary. Fanning out into the 350&amp;nbsp;km wide [[Ganges Delta]], it finally empties into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. A total of 54 rivers flow into Bangladesh from India.&lt;ref name="BRI"&gt;Sudha Ramachandran (8 June 2006). [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HF08Df04.html India, Bangladesh fight against the current]. Asia Times. Accessed 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts at resolution ==

The ex Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] and Bangladesh's founding leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] signed the wide-ranging [[Indo-Bangladeshi Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Peace]] on 19 March 1972;&lt;ref name="IB"/&gt; as per the treaty, the two nations established a [[Joint River Commission]] to work for the common interests and sharing of water resources, [[irrigation]], floods and [[cyclone]]s control.&lt;ref name="IMT"/&gt;

==Farakka Barrage==
The [[Farakka Barrage]] is a dam on the Bhagirathi river located in the Indian state of West Bengal, roughly {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on|1}}  from the border with Bangladesh. India uses it to control the flow of the [[Ganges]] river. The dam was built to divert the Ganges River water into the Hooghly River during the dry season, from January to June, to flush out the accumulating silt which in the 1950s and 1960s was a problem at the [[Kolkata Port]] on the [[Hooghly River]].&lt;ref name="IB"/&gt; Bangladesh claims that its rivers were drying up because of excess drawing of water by India.&lt;ref name="BRI"/&gt; In May 1974 a joint declaration was issued to resolve the water–sharing issue before the Farakka Barrage began operation.&lt;ref name="IPCS"/&gt; This was followed by an interim agreement in 1975 to allow India to operate [[Canal|feeder canals]] of the barrage for short periods.&lt;ref name="AME"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IMT"/&gt;

However, India withdrew from the process of negotiations by September 1976 as both nations grew apart after the [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|killing of Sheikh Mujib]] and [[Military coups in Bangladesh|establishment of military rule]].&lt;ref name="IB"/&gt; Bangladesh protested India's unilateral action at a summit of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM) and at the 31st session of the [[U.N. General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="IMT"/&gt; At the urging of other nations and the U.N., both India and Bangladesh agreed to resume dialogue, but with no results.&lt;ref name="IMT"/&gt;

===Temporary agreements===
Bilateral relations had improved in 1977 during the governments of the then-Prime Minister [[Morarji Desai]] of India and the then-President [[Ziaur Rahman]] of Bangladesh;&lt;ref name="IB"/&gt; in 1977 both leaders signed a 5-year treaty on water-sharing, but this duly expired in 1982 without being renewed.&lt;ref name="AME"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IMT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPCS"/&gt;

Bangladesh attempted to internationalise the affair by lobbying the U.N. General Assembly and the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) without result at all.&lt;ref name="AME"/&gt;

== 1996 Treaty ==
[[Image:Ganges River Delta, Bangladesh, India.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Ganges Delta]] spanning [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]].]]

The formation of an [[Awami League]] government under Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the daughter of Sheikh Mujib, in 1996 led to a fresh thaw in bilateral relations and both nations restarted negotiations.  Both leaders met in the Indian capital on 12 December 1996 and signed a 30-year, comprehensive treaty.&lt;ref name="AME"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IMT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPCS"/&gt;

As per the treaty between India and Bangladesh, signed in 1996, for sharing of the Ganges water at Farakka, the division is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ssvk.org/koshi/reports/treaty_on_farakka_india_bangladesh_4_ganga_river_water.pdf | title = Treaty between the Government of the Republic of India and the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh on sharing of the Ganga/ Ganges waters at Farakka | publisher = ssvk| accessdate = 12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
!Availability at Farakka||Share of India||Share of Bangladesh

|-
|75,000 cusecs or more||40,000 cusecs||Balance of the flow
|-
|}

Both nations were able to co-operate in harnessing the water resources; the treaty also permits the construction of [[barrage (dam)|barrages]] and irrigation projects in [[Kushtia]] and the [[Gorai-Madhumati River]] in Bangladesh, draining the southwestern districts and thus preserving the environment, natural and economic resources.&lt;ref name="IMT"/&gt;

== Assessment ==

The 1996 treaty established a long-term solution and considerably eased the strains in [[Indo-Bangladeshi relations]].&lt;ref name="AME"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IPCS"/&gt; The 1996 treaty has been attacked by the Awami League's main rival, the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP), which is regarded as hostile to India, but it did not renege from the treaty when it came to power in 2001. The BNP and other Bangladeshi political factions allege that India is drawing excessive water and the amount allocated to Bangladesh is unjust and insufficient.&lt;ref name="AME"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BRI"/&gt; India in turn complains that the water allocated to Bangladesh leaves it with less water than necessary for the functioning of the [[Kolkata Port]] and the [[National Thermal Power Corporation]] in Farakka.&lt;ref name="BRI"/&gt;

Other critics have also stressed environmental reasons for India to reconsider its drawing of water at Farraka. Alarming increases in [[deforestation]] and [[erosion]] at the upper levels of the Ganges river increases the deposition of silt at the lower level, which is already measured at 2 million tonnes annually, along with increased salinity have also led to [[desertification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Islam |first=Nahid |date=1992 |title=Indo-Bangladesh Common Rivers: The Impact on Bangladesh |journal=Contemporary South Asia |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=203–225 |doi=10.1080/09584939208719682}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bangladesh, the diversion has raised salinity levels, contaminated fisheries, hindered navigation and posed a threat to water quality and public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolf |first=Aaron T. |date=2001 |title=Water and Human Security |url=http://ucowr.org/files/Achieved_Journal_Issues/V118_A5Water%20and%20Human%20Security.pdf |journal=Journal of Contemporary Water Research and Education |volume=118 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such silt levels are believed to be adversely affecting the Hooghly river and the Kolkata Port.&lt;ref name="AME"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6780">'''Side stitch''' (also called a '''side ache''', a '''side cramp''', a '''side crampie''', a '''side sticker''' or simply the '''stitch''') is an intense stabbing [[pain]] under the lower edge of the [[ribcage]] that occurs while [[exercise|exercising]]. It is also referred to as '''exercise-related transient abdominal pain''' ('''ETAP''').&lt;ref name=pub_med_ischemia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=DP|author2=Callister, R |title=Characteristics and etiology of exercise-related transient abdominal pain.|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|date=February 2000|volume=32|issue=2|pages=432–438|pmid=10694128|doi=10.1097/00005768-200002000-00026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people think that this [[abdominal pain]] may be caused by the internal organs (like the [[liver]] and [[stomach]]) pulling downwards on the [[Diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]],&lt;ref name=Collins09&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Andrew|title=On Running on Lessons from 40 Years of Running.|date=2009|publisher=Authorhouse|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=9781438936246|page=148|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=xovMmC_USRYC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that theory is inconsistent with its frequent occurrence during [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]],&lt;ref&gt;"965 athletes in six different sports (running, swimming, cycling, aerobics, basketball, and horse riding). Over the course of a year of training and competition, 75% of swimmers had trouble with stitches, 69% of runners were afflicted, 62% of horse riders had ETAP, 52% of aerobics participants suffered, 47% of basketball players did so, and 32% of cyclists were affected " Characteristics and Etiology of Exercise-Related Transient Abdominal Pain,' Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise, Volume 32 (2), pp. 432-438, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; which involves almost no downward force on these organs. If the pain is present only when exercising and is completely absent at rest, in an otherwise healthy person, it does not require investigation.

== Causes ==
There is no single precise known reason for a stitch to occur. There are, however, a number of popular theories as to what may cause, increase the chances of, or otherwise exacerbate a stitch. A leading theory is that the pain may be caused by an increase in blood flow to the [[liver]] or [[spleen]]. Increases in the heart rate during exercise will force extra red blood cells into the liver which can cause temporary [[hepatomegaly]] and [[portal hypertension]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clinically Oriented Anatomy|last=Moore|first=Keith|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary hepatomegaly and portal hypertension can restrict blood flow through the portal vein of the liver thus slowing blood flow to the rest of the body; this is why most runner's cramps are felt on the right side near the liver.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muir|first=Brad|date=2009-12-01|title=Exercise related transient abdominal pain: a case report and review of the literature|journal=The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association|volume=53|issue=4|pages=251–260|issn=0008-3194|pmc=2796944|pmid=20037690}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plausible mechanism for the pain is that high internal pressure in the liver or spleen restricts blood flow, causing hypoxia.

There are other theories regarding side stitches than simple stretching of the [[viscus|visceral]] [[ligaments]] due to repeated vertical translation and jolting. Such theories include diaphragmatic [[ischemia]],&lt;ref name="pub_med_ischemia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Having a stitch explained|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/treatment_room/newsid_2131000/2131547.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; imbalances of the [[Thoracic vertebrae|thoracic spine]],&lt;ref name="pub_med_posture"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=DP|author2=Callister, R |title=Influence of posture and body type on the experience of exercise-related transient abdominal pain.|journal=Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine Australia|date=September 2010|volume=13|issue=5|pages=485–8|pmid=20022301|doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2009.10.487}}&lt;/ref&gt; irritation of the parietal [[peritoneum]]&lt;ref name="pub_med_ischemia" /&gt; and strain on visceral ligaments by a fluid-engorged gut.&lt;ref name="pub_med_ischemia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pub_med_ligaments"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=BT|author2=Hopkins, WG |title=Investigation of the side pain "stitch" induced by running after fluid ingestion.|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|date=August 1999|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1169–75|pmid=10449020|doi=10.1097/00005768-199908000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further theory points to shallow breathing as a possible cause for a stitch&lt;ref name="webmd"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Stop Runners' Cramps|url=http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/how-to-stop-runners-cramps|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one possible preventative measure involves adjusting at what point in a runner's stride they inhale, or reducing the frequency of inhales (with an increase in inspiratory capacity).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;p 391 The Lore of Running, Tim Noakes, Publisher: Human Kinetics Publishers Date Published: 1991 {{ISBN|978-0-88011-438-7}}  {{ISBN|0-88011-438-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons for the variety of theories include, in particular, the prevalence of ETAP during swimming.

Most of the time, side stitches occur on the right side of the body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This may be because the largest organ in the abdominal cavity, the liver, is on that side. Certain athletes also report a pain in the tip of their [[shoulder blade]]. This is believed to be because this is a [[Referred pain|referred site]] of pain for the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve.&lt;ref name=pub_med_ischemia /&gt;{{better source|date=August 2013}} When the side stitch is on the right side, published advice is to try to exhale when the left foot lands.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There is also a belief that an imbalance of electrolytes (such as calcium, potassium, and sodium) in the blood could also contribute to the side stitch.&lt;ref name=webmd /&gt;

'''Silver diammine fluoride''' (also spelled "diamine") is a topical [[medicament]] (drug) used to treat and prevent [[dental caries]] (cavities) and relieve dentinal hypersensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Silver diamine fluoride: a caries "silver-fluoride bullet"|authors=Rosenblatt, A.; Stamford, T. C. M.; Niederman, R.|journal=Journal of Dental Research|year=2009|volume=88|pages=116–125|doi=10.1177/0022034508329406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver diammine fluoride has been available in many countries including China, Japan, Germany, Nepal, Brazil, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia and others for many decades.  The product was cleared for sale by the U.S. FDA as a class II medical device for the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K102973&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
Silver diammine fluoride (SDF) is a clear liquid that will stain most oxidizable surfaces black upon exposure to light due to the formation of a silver oxide layer.  Skin and soft tissue will discolor within minutes to hours after contact and fade away (via surface shedding) within a few days.  Dentin and enamel with no demineralization present may receive surface (pellicle) stains that can be removed with pumice, while demineralized tooth structure will stain more permanently black. A mild but transient increase in erythema in the gingiva near the tooth treated by silver diammine fluoride may occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.L. Castillo, S. Rivera, T. Aparicio, R. Lazo, T.-C. Aw, L.L. Mancl, P. Milgrom|first=|date=Nov 2010|title=The Short-term Effects of Diammine Silver Fluoride on Tooth Sensitivity a Randomized Controlled Trial|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022034510388516?legid=spjdr%3B0022034510388516v2&amp;patientinform-links=yes|journal=Journal of Dental Research|volume= 90|pages=Issue 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver diammine fluoride is corrosive to metal and glass.  Contact with metal produces hydrogen gas and hydrogen fluoride while contact with glass will form silicon tetrafluoride.  It is a light-sensitive clear liquid with a strong ammonia smell (when there is excess present) and should be stored in a cool, dark, dry place in a plastic container (LDPE or HDPE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elevateoralcare.com/site/images/AASDS082415.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

SDF  should not be placed in patients who are allergic to silver or patients suffering from ulcerative gingivitis or stomatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horst|first=Jeremy A|last2=Ellenikiotis|first2=Hellene|last3=Milgrom|first3=Peter M|date=January 2016|title=UCSF Protocol for Caries Arrest Using Silver Diamine Fluoride: Rationale, Indications, and Consent|journal=Journal of the California Dental Association|volume=44|issue=1|pages=16–28|issn=1043-2256|pmc=4778976|pmid=26897901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry and nomenclature==
Silver diammine fluoride is an [[metal ammine complex|ammine (ammonia) complex]] of [[silver fluoride]]. The ammonia ligands are thus "ammine", but the term "amine" is sometimes used incorrectly for this chemical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lou|first1=YL|last2=Botelho|first2=MG|last3=Darvell|first3=BWD|title=Erratum to “Reaction of silver diammine fluoride with hydroxyapatite and protein” [J.

==Ministerial career==
=== Minister of Health (MOH) ===
[[File:Datuk Seri.jpg|left|thumb|Datuk Seri Dr. S. Subramaniam, the former Minister of Health and former Minister of Human Resources.]]
After the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 election]], Subramaniam became the Minister for Health. This brings him back to the Ministry where he first served as a house officer, nominating preventive health and public awareness of health issues as priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abnxcess.com/2013/05/new-health-minister-subramaniam-wants-to-focus-on-early-detection-and-prevention-of-diseases/|title=New Health Minister Subramaniam wants to focus on early detection and prevention of diseases|date=16 May 2013|work=Bernama|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his appointment as Minister of Health, he has tirelessly crossed the country and indeed the world, to formulate a health transformation plan to address the country's challenges and needs. He is cognizant of the many health issues that affect nations in transition. His focus is mainly on increasing public awareness on health issues, especially early detection and prevention of diseases).

Over the years since he was appointed as Health Minister, he has shown his tremendous support in oral health in Malaysia particularly in highlighting the importance of integrating oral health promotion into the general health. His countless contributions in supporting many oral health related events locally and internationally were highly respected among the dental fraternity.

Subramaniam has always give his best to endure the ministry's good, healthy relations with the health professional groups so that the close cooperation would contribute to improved health levels in Malaysia. As a medical doctor for almost 30 years before, Subramaniam had vast experience in the medical field and related issues. With his excellent leadership and exceptional orator skills, he will certainly lead the Ministry of Health to greater heights as well as attain its cherished vision of a nation working together for better health.
[[File:National Level Blood Donor Day Award jpg.jpg|thumb|246x246px|National Level Blood Donor Day Award]]

====National Level Blood Donor Day Award====
Subramaniam has done so many events and projects over the years. One of that is the National Level Blood Donation Day Celebration and Celebration Night 2017. The Minister of Health took advantage of the Health Ministry and the Malaysian government to thank the blood donors who had volunteered repeatedly for their sacrifices to assist in fulfilling the agenda of the National Blood Center. Honestly, in Malaysia, blood donation is 100% voluntarily without expecting any reward. He also appreciate certain parties such as the National Armed Forces who became a strong reserve and also women who are now actively involved in blood donation activities. Based on National Blood Center data, in 2016, a total of 693608 blood bags were received by transfusion medical services, of which 68.1% were blood donated and the rest (31.9%) were new blood donors. The Honorable also urges those who have never donated blood to participate and become blood donor replacements. The projection showed a significant increase of 30% among women who came forward to donate blood and this was a positive sign. He also recounted the Whole Malaysian Stock Exchange or "Blood Stock System" that serves to manage blood stocks and identify areas where blood stocks are scarce so stocks from other centers can be channeled to areas where there is a need. By monitoring this center, blood stocks in Malaysia will always be enough to meet the needs of the population. 
 
[[File:International medical device conference 2017.jpg|thumb|left|256x256px|International medical device conference 2017]]

==== International Medical Device Conference 2017 ====

[[File:Suku suku separuh image.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Malaysian Healthy Plate with a "Semi-Quarter"]]

==== Malaysian Healthy Plate with a "Semi-Quarter" ====
Subramaniam has took the initiative to raise awareness and skills of Malaysians on healthy eating habits and thereby reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases related to nutrition. He has organized a Malaysian Healthy Plate with a "Semi-Quarter". The concept of "Quarterly Tribes" is so easy to understand, that the plate portion of a plate is filled with carbohydrate sources such as rice or bread; Quarter dishes are filled with protein sources such as fish, chicken, meat and legumes while half dishes are filled with fruit and vegetables. By practicing this concept, one can avoid obesity problems that will bring various non-infectious diseases that are increasingly contagious among Malaysians. It is hoped that all levels of society will be able to respond to the concept of the "Tribal Tribes" that the Ministry of Health has warned and practiced this concept in daily practice.

=== Human Resource Minister (MOHR) ===
[[File:YB-Datuk-Seri-Dr-S-Subramaniam.jpg|left|thumb|Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam]]
In 2008, Subramaniam was appointed Minister for Human Resources. He served as the Human Resource Minister from 18 March 2008 until 5 May 2013. In that portfolio, he has been addressing issues of unemployment, the plight of estate workers, the challenges of unskilled workers and human resource capacity-building. He said his appointment would benefit low-income groups, especially Indians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/3/19/nation/20687228&amp;sec=nation Boost for Indian community], The Star, 19 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said issues related to Indians and employment was one of the reasons the MIC had been given the human resources portfolio in the [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Cabinet]] and he would seek solutions. He said: {{quote|The Prime Minister ([[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi|Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]) is hopeful that issues related to unemployment, low numbers enrolled in skills' training institutes and the plight of estate workers among the Indian community can be effectively addressed through the ministry}}

===The President of Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC)===
Subramaniam has been an acting president for one year from 25 June 2014 to 25 June 2015 first before officially elected until now as the ninth president of Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agnichakra.com/wpmic/|title=MIC – Malaysian Indian Congress|website=agnichakra.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malaysian Indian Blueprint ====
[[File:Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) jpg.jpg|left|thumb|267x267px|Malaysian Indian Blueprint]]
As MIC president Dr S. Subramaniam has come up with the national blueprint for the [[Malaysian Indian|Malaysian Indian community]], initiated by the Prime Minister Datuk Seri [[Najib Tun Razak]]. The brainchild of Prime Minister was the first action plan for Indians covering basic needs such as education, entrepreneurship, housing, employment, documentation, trade and social development. The implementation of this plan is under the 11th Malaysia Plan in which the government gives priority to the Malaysian Indian community, and provides various programmes to cater to their needs. Subramaniam has the idea of this as it was a new initiative to start implementing development plans for the Indian community, especially a new perspective and scope for houses of worship as an effort to bring about transformation to the Indian community.Blueprint&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mib.my/chapters/introduction/blueprint-structure/|title=The Structure of the Blueprint – Malaysian Indian Blueprint|website=mib.my|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; focus on four aspects to improve the living standards of the community of Indians. The blueprint especially address the problems of 40 per cent of households (B-40 category) in the next 10 years from now (2017). Those are to identify the basic problems, realizing the potential of every child, improving livelihood and wealth, and social issues. Subramaniam also create a special unit known as the Unit for the Socio-Economic Development of the Indian Community, under the Prime Minister's Department, where it is solely responsible for monitoring and implementing the plan. The special unit will be staffed by civil servants as executors to record the success of the main essence of the plan every year. Another initiative of Subramaniam and Najib Tun Razak is to set up a fund with an allocation of RM500 million to assist small entrepreneurs and improve their economic status as well as identify and register the B40 group for programmes that are suitable for them.

Blueprint seeks to engender the following outcomes for the Malaysian Indian community:
* Improved income and wealth levels, in both absolute and relative terms, particularly among the IB40
* Improved educational attainment, with no discernible inter-ethnic gaps
* An increased sense of inclusion into Malaysia's social fabric among the Malaysian Indian community

'''Titchwell Marsh''' is an English [[nature reserve]] owned and managed by the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB). Located on the north coast of the county of [[Norfolk]], between the villages of [[Titchwell]] and [[Thornham, Norfolk|Thornham]], about {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the seaside resort of [[Hunstanton]], its {{convert|171|ha|acre|abbr=off}} include [[reed bed]]s, [[Salt marsh|saltmarshes]], a freshwater [[lagoon]] and sandy beach, with a small woodland area near the car park. This internationally important reserve is part of the North Norfolk Coast [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) and the [[Norfolk Coast AONB|Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB), and is also protected through [[Natura 2000]], [[Special Protection Area]] (SPA) and [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] listings.

The reserve is important for some scarce breeding birds, such as [[pied avocet]]s on the islands, and [[western marsh harrier]]s, [[Eurasian bittern]]s and [[bearded reedling]]s in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the [[common rudd]]. Typical wetland birds such as the [[water rail]], [[Eurasian reed warbler|reed warbler]] and [[sedge warbler]] also appear, and [[little egret]]s are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location is important for [[bird migration|migrating birds]]. Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered [[European water vole]].

Facilities include three [[bird hide]]s, a [[seawatching]] platform, two nature trails, and a [[Visitor center|visitor centre]]. Because of concerns about [[climate change]], a major project in 2010 and 2011 brought improvements to the banks around the freshwater lagoon and the conversion of the [[brackish water|brackish]] lagoon to tidal saltmarsh, a more effective barrier to encroachment by the sea.

Titchwell Marsh is [[archaeology|archaeologically]] significant, with artefacts dating back to the [[Upper Paleolithic]], and has remains of military constructions from both world wars. These include brickwork from a [[World War I|First World War]] military hospital and 1940s artillery targets for [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s and warplanes in the [[World War II|Second World War]].

==History==
===Before 1972===
[[File:Coastal defence at Titchwell, Norfolk. - geograph.org.uk - 164972.jpg|thumb|Remains of [[Second World War]] coastal defences]]
Titchwell has a long history of human occupation. Populations of both [[anatomically modern humans|Modern]] and [[Neanderthal]] people were present in Norfolk before the last  [[glacial period|glaciation]] between 100,000 and 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago, and returned as the ice retreated north. The [[archaeological record]] is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly due to the prevailing conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present, so that many sites are now under the sea.&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; Early [[Mesolithic]] [[flint]] tools with characteristic [[Blade (archaeology)|blades]] up to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=murphy14&gt;Murphy (2009) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; long found on the present-day coast at Titchwell date from a time when it was {{convert|60|–|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the sea. Other flint tools have been found dating from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] to the [[Neolithic]]. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic, the sea level rose, filling what is now the [[North Sea]], and bringing the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line;&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; the remains of submerged forests can still be detected at low tide.&lt;ref name= murphy32&gt;Murphy (2009) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; By 11,000 BC, the makers of the long blades had gone, and peat marshes had formed behind an offshore [[barrier island]] or spit.&lt;ref name= NAE9&gt;Robertson (2005) pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; A layer of peat formed between 1920 and 1680&amp;nbsp;BC and another between 1020 and 830&amp;nbsp;BC, indicating marshy conditions;&lt;ref name= NAE152&gt;Robertson (2005) p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; polished Neolithic axes found in those layers were blackened by exposure to the peat.&lt;ref name= NAE15&gt;Robertson (2005) pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two possible timber platforms were identified within the peat at Titchwell, and may be prehistoric. Similar [[Bronze Age]] structures are rare, and they may be significant in providing information about early timber construction methods.&lt;ref name= NAE149&gt;Robertson (2005) p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medieval]] and later pottery has been found at Titchwell, and the peat and [[silt]]s which overlay the [[sediment]]s deposited by the retreating [[glacier]]s have signs of post-medieval ploughing.&lt;ref name= NAE15/&gt;

The draining of Norfolk's coastal marshes commenced in the late 17th and 18th centuries, and sea defences including the "Old Lord's Bank" at Titchwell were shown in maps from 1786 and 1797.&lt;ref name= NAE9/&gt; For the next 170 years or so, the reclaimed marsh was [[arable land|arable]], producing crops and beef cattle.&lt;ref name= Robinson&gt;Robinson (1986) p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; A huge influx of [[Pallas's sandgrouse]] into Britain in 1853 led to several arrivals at Titchwell, including mated pairs. The last bird seen was on the saltmarsh, and the rest were on the dunes or in [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|marram grass]]; many were shot.&lt;ref name= zool21&gt;{{cite journal | last= Dodman | first= M |author2=Dodman, W | year= 1853 | title= Pallas' Sand Grouse in Norfolk | journal = The Zoologist | volume= XXI | page= 8686 | url = |format = | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= zool22&gt;{{cite journal | last= Stevenson | first= Henry | year= 1854 | title= Pallas' Sand Grouse in Norfolk | journal = The Zoologist | volume= XXII | page= 8957 | url = |format = | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SS Vina, The Brancaster Wreck.jpg|thumb|The wreck of the SS ''Vina'', seen in 2010.]]
Thornham Marsh, immediately west of Titchwell, was used between 1914 and 1918 by the [[Royal Flying Corps]] as a [[bombing range]]. Some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is all that remains of a military hospital dating from that period. A First World War concrete building along the west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the [[British Army]] returned in 1942.&lt;ref name= beforerspb &gt;''Titchwell Marsh before the RSPB''. RSPB information sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], military defences were constructed at Titchwell. The drainage of farmland behind the banks was stopped, reflooding the former marshland;&lt;ref name = rspbarch&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Archaeology and history | work= Titchwell Marsh | url= http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/t/titchwellmarsh/archaeology.aspx | publisher= RSPB}} Retrieved 5 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; zigzag ditches were dug, and [[British hardened field defences of World War II|pillboxes]] built into Old Lord's Bank.&lt;ref name= NAE15/&gt; Between 1942 and 1945, the marsh was used by the [[Royal Tank Regiment]];&lt;ref name=beforerspb/&gt; an [[armoured fighting vehicle]] gunnery range was established and new banks were constructed for firing practice, with targets set at {{convert|900|m|yd|abbr=on}} intervals. Some of the still extant islands were built to hold "pop-up" targets, operated by cables from winches in a building whose foundations lie below Island Hide. Remains of the triangular concrete track used by the tanks also survive.&lt;ref name=beforerspb/&gt;&lt;ref name = rspbarch/&gt; Military activities continued after the war, with the [[Royal Air Force]] returning to Thornham Marsh between 1950 and 1959. Bombing practice was supervised from a control tower, which was demolished in 1962, leaving only a concrete structure opposite the end of Titchwell's west bank.&lt;ref name= NAE15/&gt;&lt;ref name=beforerspb/&gt; The remains of two Second World War [[Covenanter tank]]s, probably used as targets, are sometimes exposed at low tide.&lt;ref name = rspbarch/&gt;

The wreck of the SS ''Vina'', a cargo steamer built in 1894, can be seen at low tide. In 1944, she was anchored offshore for use as an RAF [[target ship|target]] when a gale dragged her to her present location and sank her. After the war, some of the wreck was salvaged as scrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?69922 |title=SS ''Vina'' (+1944) |author=Dowse, Julian |work= |publisher= Wreck Site |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the ''Vina'' are accessible at low tide, but visiting them is potentially hazardous as the wreck is quickly cut off and submerged by the incoming tide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hunstanton lifeboat crew warns of Brancaster wreck danger |author= Semmens, Donna  |url=http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/hunstanton_lifeboat_crew_warns_of_brancaster_wreck_danger_1_991014 | newspaper=Eastern Daily Press |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deadly peril of a treacherous tide |author=Shaw, John |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1352827/Deadly-peril-of-a-treacherous-tide.html | newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=15 August 2000 |accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A warning sign on the wreck advises anyone reaching it to return to the beach immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2034303 |title=TF7846 : SS Vina – Safety warning sign |author=Dowse, Julian |work= |publisher=Geograph Britain and Ireland |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the sea wall, the marshes were drained after the war, and reverted to farmland, but the bank was breached in the [[North Sea flood of 1953]], returning the whole area to tidal saltmarsh dominated by [[Aster tripolium|sea aster]].&lt;ref name = hammond&gt;Hammomd (1984) pp. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of a new sea wall across the reserve created a shallow freshwater lagoon, with a [[reed bed]] on its northern side and a vegetation-free brackish marsh.&lt;ref name =hammond/&gt;

===RSPB era===
[[File:Recurvirostra avosetta -Titchwell Marsh, Norfolk, England -swimming-8.jpg|The [[pied avocet|avocet]] features on the RSPB's logo.|thumb]]
Between 1970 and 1972, a pair of [[Montagu's harrier]]s, Britain's rarest breeding [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], nested in the reed bed. The RSPB bought the reserve in 1973 for £53,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|53|1973|r=0}}}},000 in 20{{CURRENTYEARYY}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} The Montagu's harriers did not return, but [[western marsh harrier|marsh harriers]] did, and the RSPB commenced improving the habitat and facilities, including embanking the lagoons and building a car park and visitor centre. Avocets, then still very rare in the UK, first bred here in 1984. The visitor centre facilities were improved between 1987 and 1989 to cope with the numbers of visitors.&lt;ref name= afterrspb&gt;''The RSPB and Titchwell Marsh''. RSPB information sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the sea broke through the dunes at the eastern end of the beach near the former Tern Hide, and the dunes started to [[erosion|erode]]. The remains of the Second World War tanks first appeared around this time. In the following year the boardwalk at the beach end of the west bank was constructed to protect the dunes, and the [[seawatching]] platform was added at its northern end. {{convert|12|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of land to the east of the reserve was bought in 1993; much of this was formerly part of the firing range, and large amounts of [[barbed wire]] caused problems when the area was being converted to reed bed and wet grazing meadow. Over the winter, an old hide on the West Bank was demolished and replaced with the current Island Hide. Storms in February 1996 removed most of the dunes east of the boardwalk, and eroded those to the west. The Tern Hide, now cut off at high tide, was dismantled. Developments at the end of the 20th century included the 1997 extension of the visitor centre, which included building a cafe, and the erection of Fen Hide in 1999, together with a boardwalk path to the hide, and a dragonfly pond.&lt;ref name= afterrspb/&gt;

The reserve covers {{convert|171|ha|acre|abbr=off}},&lt;ref name =hammond/&gt; and is of international importance for its breeding and wintering birds. It was designated as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) in 1973, and in 1986 it was subsumed into the {{convert|7700|ha|acre|abbr=off}} North Norfolk Coast SSSI. The larger area is now additionally protected through [[Natura 2000]], [[Special Protection Area]] (SPA) and [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] listings, and is part of the [[Norfolk Coast AONB|Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB).&lt;ref name=encitation&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=North Norfolk Coast |work=SSSI citations |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001342.pdf |publisher=Natural England |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AxoEYZ20?url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001342.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-26 |df= }} Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = rspbmain&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Titchwell Marsh| work= Reserve guide| url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/t/titchwellmarsh/ | publisher= RSPB}} Retrieved 6 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = aonb&gt;{{cite web| author = | title= Other Conservation Designations within the AONB December 2009 | work= Norfolk Coast AONB Management Plan 2009–14 | url= http://www.norfolkcoastaonb.org.uk/mediaps/pdfuploads/pd001159.pdf | publisher= Norfolk Coast partnership}} Retrieved 8 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the RSPB's most visited reserve, with about 92,000 visitors annually.&lt;ref name=rspbfacts&gt;{{cite web|author= |title=Fact File |work=Reserves |url=http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/pdf/1390-42b%20Birdwatching2.pdf |publisher=RSPB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719080254/http://west-norfolk.gov.uk/pdf/1390-42b%20Birdwatching2.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-19 |df= }} Retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the RSPB's busiest reserve, Titchwell Marsh has a significant economic impact on its locality. A 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137,700 visitors spent £1.8&amp;nbsp;million locally in 1998.&lt;ref name = economy&gt;Shiel (2002) pp. 6–16.&lt;/ref&gt; The tiny village of [[Titchwell]] has two three-star hotels and a shop selling [[telescope]]s and [[binoculars]], although it does not have a general store or a [[public house]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titchwellmanor.com/ Titchwell Manor] Titchwell Manor.

A 2005 survey at Titchwell and five other North Norfolk coastal sites found that 39&amp;nbsp;per cent of visitors gave [[birdwatching]] as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7&amp;nbsp;million day visitors and 5.5&amp;nbsp;million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122&amp;nbsp;million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Liley (2008) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tumor microenvironment contributes to [[tumour heterogeneity]].

== History ==

The importance of a [[Stromal cell|stromal]] microenvironment, especially “wound” or regenerating tissue, has been recognized since the late 1800s. The interplay between the tumor and its microenvironment was part of [[Stephen Paget]]'s 1889 "seed and soil" theory, in which he postulated that metastases of a particular type of cancer ("the seed") often metastasizes to certain sites ("the soil") based on the similarity of the original and secondary tumor sites.&lt;ref&gt;The Lancet, Volume 133, Issue 3421, 23 March 1889, Pages 571-573&lt;/ref&gt;

Its role in blunting an immune attack awaited the discovery of adaptive cellular immunity. In 1960, Klein and colleagues found that in mice, primary [[methylcholanthrene]]-induced [[sarcomas]] exhibited an antitumor immune response mediated by [[lymph node]] cells to cancer cells derived from the primary tumor. This immune response did not however affect the primary tumor. The primary tumor instead established a microenvironment that is functionally analogous to that of certain normal tissues, such as the eye.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Later, mice experiments by Halachmi and Witz showed that for the same cancer cell line, greater tumorigenicity was evident ''in vivo'' than the same strain inoculated ''in vitro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halachmi |first1=E.|last2= Witz |first2=I.P. |title=Differential tumorigenicity of 3T3 cells transformed in vitro with polyoma virus and in vivo selection for high tumorigenicity |journal=Cancer Research |volume =49 |issue=9 |year=1989 |pp= 2383–2389 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/49/9/2383.full.pdf |accessdate=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witz"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Isaac P. |last1=Witz |first2=Orlev |last2=Levy-Nissenbaum |title=The tumor microenvironment in the post-PAGET era |journal=Cancer Letters |volume =242 |issue=1 |date=8 October 2006 |pp= 1–10 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2005.12.005 |doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2005.12.005 |accessdate=June 2015 |pmid=16413116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unambiguous evidence for the inability in humans of a systemic [[immune response]] to eliminate immunogenic cancer cells was provided by Boon’s 1991 studies of [[antigens]] that elicit specific [[CD8+|CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[T cell]] responses in [[melanoma]] patients. One such antigen was [[Cancer/testis antigens|MAGE-A1]]. The coexistence of a progressing melanoma with melanoma-specific T cells implicitly does not involve [[immunoediting]], but does not exclude the possibility of TME immune suppression.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The discovery of melanoma-specific T cells in patients led to the strategy of adoptively transferring large numbers of ''in vitro-''expanded [[tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes]] (TILs) which has proven that the [[immune system]] has the potential to control cancer. However, [[Adoptive cell transfer|adoptive T cell therapy]] (ACT) with TILs has not had the dramatic success of ACT with virus-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. The TME of solid cancers appears to be fundamentally different to that of the [[leukemias]], in which clinical ACT trials with [[chimeric antigen receptor]] T cells have demonstrated efficacy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Vasculature ==

''See:'' [[Tumor-associated endothelial cells]]

80–90% of cancer are [[carcinoma]]s, or cancers that form in the epithelial tissue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancer.stanford.edu/information/cancerOverview.html Standford Medicine Cancer Institute, Cancer Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; This tissue is not vascularized, which prevents tumors from growing greater than 2mm in diameter without inducing new blood vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Michael J. |last1=Duffy |title=The biochemistry of metastasis |journal=Advances in Clinical Chemistry |volume=32 |year=1996 |pp=135–160 |pmid=8899072}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of [[angiogenesis]] is dysregulated to feed the cancer cells and as a result the vasculature formed differs from that of normal tissue.

=== Enhanced permeability and retention effect ===

The [[enhanced permeability and retention effect]] (EPR effect) is the observation that the vasculature of tumors is often leaky and accumulates molecules in the blood stream to a greater extent than in normal tissue. This inflammation effect is not only seen in tumors, but in hypoxic areas of [[Myocardium|cardiac muscles]] following a [[myocardial infarction]] (MI or heart attack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=T.N. |last1=Palmer |first2=V.J. |last2=Caride |first3=M.A. |last3=Caldecourt |first4=J. |last4=Twickler |first5=V. |last5=Abdullah |title=The mechanism of liposome accumulation in infarction |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects |volume=797 |year=1984 |pp=363–368 |pmid=6365177 |doi=10.1016/0304-4165(84)90258-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Danhier"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Fabienne |last1=Danhier |first2=Olivier |last2=Feron |first3=Véronique |last3=Préat |title=To exploit the tumor microenvironment: Passive and active tumor targeting of nanocarriers for anti-cancer drug delivery |journal=Journal of Controlled Release |volume=148 |issue=2 |date=1 December 2010 |pp=135–146 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.08.027 |doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2010.08.027 |accessdate=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leaky vasculature is thought to have several causes, including insufficient [[pericytes]] and a malformed [[basement membrane]].&lt;ref name="Danhier" /&gt;

=== Hypoxia ===

The tumor microenvironment is often [[Tumor hypoxia|hypoxic]]. As the tumor mass increases, the interior of the tumor grows farther away from existing blood supply. While angiogenesis can reduce this effect, the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen is below 5&amp;nbsp;mm [[Mercury (element)|Hg]] (venous blood has a partial pressure of oxygen at 40&amp;nbsp;mm Hg) in more than 50% of locally advanced solid tumors.&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Cynthia E. |last1=Weber |first2=Paul C. |last2=Kuo |title=The tumor microenvironment |journal=Surgical Oncology |volume=21 |issue=3 |date=September 2012 |pp=172–177 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.suronc.2011.09.001 |doi=10.1016/j.suronc.2011.09.001 |accessdate=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dx"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mikhail V. |last=Blagosklonny |title=Antiangiogenic therapy and tumor progression |journal=Cancer Cell |volume=5 |issue=1 |date=January 2004 |pp=13–17 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00336-2 |doi=10.1016/S1535-6108(03)00336-2 |accessdate=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypoxic environment leads to [[Genome instability#Genome instability in cancer|genetic instability]], which is associated with cancer progression, via downregulating [[DNA repair]] mechanisms such as [[nucleotide excision repair]] (NER) and [[DNA mismatch repair|mismatch repair]] (MMR) pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ranjit S. |last1=Bindra |first2=Peter M. |last2=Glazer |title=Genetic instability and the tumor microenvironment: towards the concept of microenvironment-induced mutagenesis |journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis |volume=569 |issue=1–2 |date=6 January 2005 |pp=75–85 |pmid=15603753 |doi=10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2004.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypoxia also causes the upregulation of [[HIF1A|hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha]] (HIF1-α), which induces angiogenesis and is associated with poorer prognosis and the activation of genes associated with metastasis,&lt;ref name="dx" /&gt; leading, for instance, to increased cell migration and also ECM remodeling.&lt;ref name="physicalMicroenvironment"/&gt;

While a lack of oxygen can cause glycolytic behavior in cells, tumor cells also undergo aerobic glycolysis, in which they preferentially produce [[lactic acid|lactate]] from glucose even given abundant oxygen, called the [[Warburg effect (oncology)|Warburg effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert A. |last1=Gatenby |first2=Robert J. |last2=Gillies |title=Why do cancers have high aerobic glycolysis? |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |issue=11 |date=November 2004 |pp=891–899 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrc1478 |doi=10.1038/nrc1478 |volume=4 |pmid=15516961}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter the cause, this leaves the extracellular microenvironment acidic (pH 6.5–6.9), while the cancer cells themselves are able to remain neutral (ph 7.2–7.4).

== Reactive stromal cells ==

The [[Stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]] of a carcinoma is the connective tissue below the basal [[Basal lamina|lamina]].  This includes [[fibroblasts]], ECM, immune cells and other cells and molecules. The stroma surrounding a tumor often reacts to intrusion via inflammation, similar to how it might respond to a [[Wound healing|wound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Harold F. |last=Dvorak |title=Tumors: wounds that do not heal.

=== Carcinoma associated fibroblasts ===

[[Cancer-associated fibroblasts|Carcinoma associated fibroblasts]] (CAFs) are a heterogenous group of fibroblasts whose function is pirated by cancer cells and redirected toward carcinogenesis&lt;ref name="Hanahan"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Douglas |last1=Hanahan |first2=Lisa M. |last2=Coussens |title=Accessories to the Crime: Functions of Cells Recruited to the Tumor Microenvironment |journal=Cancer Cell |volume =21 |issue =3 |date=20 March 2012 |pp= 309–322 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2012.02.022 |doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2012.02.022 |pmid=22439926}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells are usually derived from the normal fibroblasts in the surrounding stroma but can also come from [[pericyte]]s, smooth muscle cells, [[fibrocyte]]s, [[mesenchymal stem cells]] (MSCs, often derived from bone marrow), or via [[epithelial-mesenchymal transition]] (EMT) or endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Kati |last1=Räsänen |first2=Antti |last2=Vaheri |title=Activation of fibroblasts in cancer stroma |journal=Experimental Cell Research |volume =316 |issue =17 |date=15 October 2010 |pp= 2713–2722 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.04.032 |doi=10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.04.032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marsh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Michael |last1=Quant |last2=Shui Ping |first2=Tu |first3=Hiroyuki |last3=Tomita |first4=Tamas |last4=Gonda |first5=Sophie S.W. |last5=Wang |first6=Shigeo |last6=Takashi |first7=Gwang Ho |last7=Baik |first8=Wataru |last8=Shibata |first9=Bethany |last9=DiPrete |first10=Kelly S. |last10=Betz |first11=Richard |last11=Friedman |first12=Andrea |last12=Varro |first13=Benjamin |last13=Tycko |first14=Timothy C. |last14=Wang |title=Bone Marrow-Derived Myofibroblasts Contribute to the Mesenchymal Stem Cell Niche and Promote Tumor Growth |journal=Cancer Cell |volume =19 |issue =2 |date=15 February 2011 |pp= 257–272 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2011.01.020 |doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2011.01.020 |pmid=21316604 |pmc=3060401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike their normal counterparts, CAFs do not retard cancer growth ''in vitro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Emilie |last1=Flaberg |first2= Laszlo |last2=Markasz |first3= Gabor |last3=Petranyi |first4= Gyorgy |last4=Stuber |first5= Ferenc |last5=Dicső |first6= Nidal |last6=Alchihabi |first7=Eva |last7=Oláh |first8=István |last8=Csízy |first9=Tamás |last9=Józsa |first10=Ove |last10=Andrén |first11=Jan-Erik |last11=Johansson |first12=Swen-Olof |last12=Andersson |first13= George |last13=Klein |first14=Laszlo |last14=Szekely |title=&lt;/font&gt;High-throughput live-cell imaging reveals differential inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by human fibroblasts|journal=Cancer Cell Biology |volume =128 |date=29 December 2010 |pp= 2793–2802 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ijc.25612 |doi=10.1002/ijc.25612}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAFs perform several functions that support tumor growth, such as secreting [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF), [[fibroblast growth factor]]s (FGFs), [[platelet-derived growth factor]] (PDGF), and other pro-angiogenic signals to induce angiogenesis.&lt;ref name="Weber" /&gt; CAFs can also secrete [[transforming growth factor beta]] (TGF-β), which is associated with EMT, a process by which cancer cells can metastasize,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Christine L. |last1=Chaffer |first2=Robert A. |last2=Weinberg |title=A Perspective on Cancer Cell Metastasis |journal=Science |volume= 331 |issue=6024 |date=25 March 2011 |pp=1559–1564 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1203543 |doi=10.1126/science.1203543 |pmid=21436443}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with inhibiting [[T cell#Cytotoxic|cytotoxic T cells]] and [[natural killer T cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Daniel G. |last1=Stover |first2=Brian |last2=Bierie |first3=Harold L. |last3=Moses |title=A delicate balance: TGF-β and the tumor microenvironment |journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry |volume =101 |issue =4 |date=July 2007 |pp= 851–861 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcb.21149 |doi=10.1002/jcb.21149}}&lt;/ref&gt; As fibroblasts, CAFs are able to rework the ECM to include more paracrine survival signals such as IGF-1 and IGF-2, thus promoting survival of the surrounding cancer cells. CAFs are also associated with the [[Reverse Warburg Effect]] where the CAFs perform aerobic glycolysis and feed lactate to the cancer cells.&lt;ref name="Hanahan" /&gt;

Several markers identify CAFs, including expression of [[ACTA2|α smooth muscle actin]] (αSMA), [[vimentin]], [[PDGFRA|platelet-derived growth factor receptor α]] (PDGFR-α), [[PDGFRB|platelet-derived growth factor receptor β]] (PDGFR-β), fibroblast specific protein 1 (FSP-1) and [[Fibroblast activation protein, alpha|fibroblast activation protein]] (FAP).&lt;ref name ="Marsh"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Timothy |last1=Marsh |first2=Kristian |last2=Pietras |first3=Sandra S. |last3=McAllister |title=Fibroblasts as architects of cancer pathogenesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Basis of Disease |date=30 October 2012 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.10.013 |doi=10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.10.013 |volume=1832 |pages=1070–1078}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these factors can be used to differentiate CAFs from all other cells by itself.

=== Myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor associated macrophages ===

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogenous population of cells of [[Myeloid|myelogenous]] origin with the potential to repress [[T cell]] responses.

=== Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ===

[[Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte]]s (TILs) are lymphocytes that penetrate a tumor. TILs have a common origin with myelogenous cells at the [[hematopoietic stem cell]], but diverge in development. Concentration is generally positively correlated.&lt;ref name="Solinas"&gt;{{cite journal|first=G. |last1=Solinas |first2=G. |last2=Germano |first3=A. |last3=Mantovani |first4= P. |last4=Allavena |title= Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) as major players of the cancer-related inflammation |journal = Journal of Leukocyte Biology |volume =86 |issue =  5|date= November 2009 |pp= 1065–1073 |url=http://www.jleukbio.org/content/86/5/1065 |doi=10.1189/jlb.0609385}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only in melanoma has autologous TIL transplant succeeded as a treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Simon |last1=Turcotte |first2= Steven A. |last2=Rosenberg |title= Immunotherapy of Metastatic Solid Cancers |journal = Advances in Surgery |volume=45 |year=2011 |pp= 342–360 |doi=10.1016/j.yasu.2011.04.003 |pmid=21954698 |pmc=3578602}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer cells induce apoptosis of activated T cells (a class of lymphocyte) by secreting [[exosome (vesicle)|exosome]]s containing death ligands such as FasL and TRAIL, and via the same method, turn off the normal cytotoxic response of [[natural killer cell]]s (NK cells).&lt;ref name="Valenti" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Aled |last1=Clayton |first2= Zsuzsanna |last2=Tabi |title= Exosomes and the MICA-NKG2D system in cancer |journal = Blood Cells, Molecules, and Diseases |volume = 34 |issue =  3 |date=May–June 2005 |pp= 206–213 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcmd.2005.03.003 |doi=10.1016/j.bcmd.2005.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that cancer cells actively work to restrain TILs.

=== Extracellular matrix remodeling ===

Fibroblasts are in charge of laying down most of the [[collagens]], [[elastin]], [[glycosaminoglycans]], [[proteoglycans]] (e.g. [[perlecan]]), and [[glycoproteins]] in the ECM. As many fibroblasts are transformed into CAFs during carcinogenesis, this reduces the amount of ECM produced and the ECM that is produced can be malformed, like collagen being loosely woven and non-planar, possibly even curved.&lt;ref name="Tisty" /&gt; In addition, CAFs produce [[matrix metalloproteinase]]s (MMP) that cleave the proteins within the ECM.&lt;ref name="Weber" /&gt; CAFs are also able to disrupt the ECM via force, generating a track that a carcinoma cell can follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Cedric |last1=Gaggioli |first2= Steven |last2=Hooper |first3= Cristina |last3=Hidalgo-Carcedo |first4= Robert |last4=Grosse |first5= John F. |last5=Marshall |first6= Kevin |last6=Harrington |first7=Erik |last7=Sahai |title= Fibroblast-led collective invasion of carcinoma cells with differing roles for RhoGTPases in leading and following cells |journal= Nature Cell Biology |volume= 9 |date=25 November 2007 |pp= 1392–1400|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncb1658 |doi=10.1038/ncb1658 |pmid=18037882}}&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, destruction of the ECM allows cancer cells to escape from their in situ location and [[intravasate]] into the blood stream where they can metastasize systematically. It can also provide passage for endothelial cells to complete angiogenesis to the tumor site.

Destruction of the ECM also modulates the signaling cascades controlled by the interaction of cell-surface receptors and the ECM,  and it also reveals binding sites previously hidden, like the integrin [[alpha-v beta-3]] (αVβ3) on the surface of melanoma cells can be ligated to rescue the cells from apoptosis after degradation of collagen.&lt;ref name="Pupa"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Serenella M. |last1=Pupa |first2= Sylvie |last2=Ménard |first3= Stefania |last3=Forti |first4=  Elda |last4=Tagliabue |title= New insights into the role of extracellular matrix during tumor onset and progression |journal= Journal of Cellular Physiology |volume= 192 |issue= 3 |date=September 2002 |pp= 259–267|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcp.10142 |doi=10.1002/jcp.10142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Anthony M.P. |last1=Montgomery |first2= Ralph A. |last2=Reisfeld |first3=  David A. |last3=Cheresh |title= Integrin αvβ3 rescues melanoma cells from apoptosis in three-dimensional dermal collagen |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume= 91 |issue= 19 |date=13 September 1994 |pp= 8856–8860 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.19.8856 |pmid=7522323 |pmc=44705}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the degradation products may have downstream effects as well that can increase cancer cell tumorigenicity and can serve as potential biomarkers.&lt;ref name="Pupa" /&gt; ECM destruction also releases the cytokines and growth factors stored therein (for example, VEGF, [[basic fibroblast growth factor]] (bFGF), [[insulin-like growth factor]]s (IGF1 and IGF2), TGF-β, EGF, [[heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor]] (HB-EGF), and [[tumor necrosis factor]] (TNF), which can increase the growth of the tumor.&lt;ref name="Tisty"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Thea D. |last1=Tisty  |first2=Lisa M. |last2=Coussens |title= Tumor stroma and regulation of cancer development |journal= Annual Review of Pathology: Mechanisms of Disease |volume= 1 |date=February 2006 |pp= 11–150|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.pathol.1.110304.100224 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pathol.1.110304.100224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Gabriele |last1=Bergers  |first2=Lisa M |last2=Coussens |title= Extrinsic regulators of epithelial tumor progression: metalloproteinases |journal= Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume= 10 |issue= 1 |date=1 February 2000 |pp= 120–127|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0959-437X(99)00043-X |doi=10.1016/S0959-437X(99)00043-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleavage of ECM components can also release cytokines that inhibit tumorigenesis, such as degradation of certain types of collagen can form [[endostatin]], restin, canstatin and [[tumstatin]], which have antiangiogenic functions.&lt;ref name="Tisty" /&gt;

=== Relation to T cells ===
Preclinical mice studies implicate CAFs, TAMs and [[myelomonocytic]] cells (including several myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)) in restricting T cell accumulation near cancer cells. Overcoming this restriction, combined with a [[immune checkpoint inhibitor|T cell checkpoint antagonist]], revealed enhanced antitumor effects. Tumor vasculature also plays an active role in restricting T cell entry into the TME.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

T cells reach tumor sites via the circulatory system. The TME appears to preferentially recruit other immune cells over T cells from that system. One such mechanism is the release of cell-type specific [[chemokines]]. Another is the TME's capacity to posttranslationally alter chemokines. For example, the production of reactive nitrogen species by MDSCs within the TME induces nitration of [[CCL2]] (N-CCL2), which traps T cells in the stroma of colon and prostate cancers. N-CCL2 does attract monocytes. CCL2 nitration inhibitors enhanced the accumulation of TILs in the corresponding animal models and resulted in improved efficacy of ACT.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Another T cell inhibitor appears to be the [[apoptosis]] inducer [[Fas ligand]] (FasL) that is found in the tumor vasculature of tumor types including ovarian, colon, prostate, breast, bladder and renal cancer. High levels of endothelial FasL are accompanied by few CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, but abundant T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells. In preclinical models inhibiting FasL increased the ratio of tumor-rejecting T cells to T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells and T cell–dependent tumor suppression. FasL inhibition also improves ACT efficacy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In ovarian cancer elevated VEGF levels and expression of the immune regulatory ligand B7H3 ([[CD276]]), or the [[endothelin]] B receptor (ET&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R) on tumor vessels correlate with decreased T cell infiltration and worse clinical outcome. Pharmacological inhibition of ET&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R increased T cell adhesion to endothelial cells in an [[intercellular adhesion molecule-1]] (ICAM-1)–dependent manner, increasing TIL numbers in mice and a corresponding tumor response. Anti-angiogenic inhibitors targeting VEGF and its receptor VEGFR2 (approved for treatment of multiple cancers) induce vascular normalization. This, in turn, increases TILs and improves ACT and vaccine efficacy in preclinical models. VEGF impairs DC maturation, offering another means to enhance intratumoral immune responses. Deleting the regulator of G-protein signaling, [[RGS5|Rgs5]] reduced vessel leakiness and hypoxia, enhanced T cell infiltration into mouse pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and prolonged animal survival. Vascular normalization is thus likely more effective than vessel destruction. Targeted delivery of t[[Tumor necrosis factor-α|umor necrosis factor-α]] (TNF-α) was reported to normalize tumor blood vessels, increase CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell infiltration and enhance vaccine and ACT therapies, unlike inflammatory cytokines [[interferon-γ]] (IFN-γ).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Reproduction ====
T cells must reproduce after arriving at the tumor site to further increase their numbers, survive the TME's hostile elements and migrate through the stroma to the cancer cells. The TME obstructs all three activities. The draining lymph nodes are the likely location for T cell clonal reproduction, although this also occurs within the tumor. Preclinical models suggest that the TME is the major site of cancer-specific T cell cloning and that the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell replicative response there is orchestrated by the [[CD103]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Baft3-dependent DC, which can efficiently cross-present cancer cell antigens, suggesting that therapeutic interventions that enhance CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; contribute to tumor control. Among such strategies are antibodies to the [[interleukin-10 receptor]] (IL10R). In a mammary carcinoma mouse model it neutralized the effects of TAM-produced [[Interleukin 10|IL10]], relieved the suppression of [[Interleukin 12|IL12]] production by intratumoral DCs and improved the CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell–dependent antitumor effects of chemotherapy. A similar outcome was achieved by neutralizing [[macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] 1, which impaired the intratumoral accumulation of TAMs. Another strategy is the administration of antibody-interferon-β (IFN-β) complexes that activate intratumoral DCs to cross-present antigen to CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. They are targeted against oncogenic receptors such as [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tumor eradication resulted when PD-L1 (also induced by IFN-β acting on DCs) was neutralized. DC function also may be adversely affected by the TME's hypoxic conditions, which induces PD-L1 expression on DCs and other myelomonocytic cells as a result of [[hypoxia-inducible factors]]-1α (HIF-1α) binding directly to a hypoxia-responsive element in the PD-L1 promoter. Even the aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells may antagonize local immune reactions via increasing lactate production, which induces the M2 TAM polarization. An M1 to M2 phenotypic transition of intratumoral [[macrophages]] was reported after the induction of cancer cell apoptosis in human and mouse gastrointestinal stromal tumors by KIT [[oncoprotein]] inhibitor [[imatinib]]. The designation of M1 and M2 polarization states over-simplify macrophage biology, since at least six different TAM subpopulations are known. Therefore, TME TAM phenotype descriptors are likely important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The TME may also directly impair intratumoral T cell proliferation. [[Indole 2,3-dioxygenase]] (IDO)—which can be expressed by DCs, MDSCs and cancer cells—[[Catabolism|catabolizes]] [[tryptophan]] and generates [[kynurenine]]. Both the deprivation of tryptophan and the generation of its metabolic product inhibit clonal T cell expansion. IDO also promotes the conversion of T cells to T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells and increases [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] expression, which augments MDSC functions. Accordingly, IDO1 genetic deficiency is associated with reduced tumor burden and metastasis and enhanced survival in mouse models of lung and breast cancer. The therapeutic potential of inhibiting IDO, in combination with anti-CTLA-4 was demonstrated in the B16 melanoma model and was associated with increased intratumoral T cells. IDO's capacity to block T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cell to helperlike cell reprogramming by sustaining transcription factor [[Eos (protein)|Eos]] and the transcriptional program it regulates, also suppresses the immune response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Apoptosis ====
The TME can limit T cell  viability. Both IDO and PD-L1 may induce T cell apoptosis. Myelomonocytic cell products that cause apoptosis include FasL, TNF-α, and [[TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand]] (TRAIL). Ppp2r2d is a key regulator promoting T cell apoptosis and suppressing T cell proliferation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== TAMs and MDSCs ====
Targeting intratumoral TAMs and MDSCs can also reduce tumor burdens in preclinical models, in both T cell–dependent and T cell–independent ways. For instance, inhibiting [[CCR2|chemokine receptor type 2]] (CCR2), [[colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor]] (CSF-1R) and [[granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor]] (GM-CSF) in preclinical models of melanoma, pancreatic, breast, and prostatic carcinoma increased T cells and restricted tumor growth. The effect was enhanced by anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1/PD-L1. These studies did not determine whether the increases in T cells were a consequence of viability or replication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Inhibition of CSF-1R in a preclinical proneural glioblastoma multiforme model and in patient-derived [[glioma]] [[xenografts]] increased survival and shrank established tumors in an apparently T cell–independent manner that correlated with the reprogramming of [[macrophages]] away from an M2 phenotype. Similarly, an activator of TAMs, an agonistic antibody to CD40, when administered in combination with the chemotherapeutic drug [[gemcitabine]], suppressed mouse PDA growth in a T cell–independent manner, suggesting that stimulated macrophages may have anticancer functions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

B cells regulate TAM phenotypes in squamous cell carcinoma TME. Correspondingly, B cell depletion reprogrammed TAMs, thus reducing their suppression of CD8 cells and enhancing chemotherapy. An autochthonous melanoma mouse model depleted T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells and neutralized IL-10, revealing tumor-killing properties. TAMs mediate the effects of antitumor antibodies and genetically engineered ligands that interact with [[CD47]] to prevent the CD47/[[Signal-regulatory protein alpha|signal regulatory protein–α]] (SIRPα) signaling system from suppressing antibody-coated cancer cell [[phagocytosis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Spatial distribution ====
CAFs restrict T cell distribution by two means. They can physically exclude them, as mediated by their extracellular matrix. T cell motility was higher in regions of loose [[fibronectin]] and collagen than in dense matrix areas surrounding tumor nests. [[Collagenase]] added to reduce matrix rigidity or [[chemokine]] [[CCL5]] experimentally produced by tumor cells increased movement into contact with cancer cells.

They can also exclude them via biosynthesis of [[CXCL12]]. Conditionally depleting these cells from the stroma of an ectopic, transplanted tumor and of an autochthonous pancreatic ductal [[adenocarcinoma]] (PDA) allowed T cells to rapidly control tumor growth. However, the depletion must be limited to the TME, because these cells carry out essential functions in several normal tissues. “Reprogramming” FAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the TME with a [[vitamin D]] analog may neutralize them. Another approach may block their immune suppressive mechanism. In a preclinical PDA mouse model, FAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CAFs produced the chemokine CXCL12, which is bound by PDA cancer cells. Because FAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; stromal cells also accumulate in nontransformed, inflammatory lesions, this “coating” of cancer cells may reflect a means by which “injured” epithelial cells protect themselves from immune attack. Administering an inhibitor of CXCL12 receptor [[CXCR4]] caused the rapid spread of T cells among cancer cells, arrested tumor growth and stimulated tumor sensitivity to anti-PD-L1.

== Clinical implications ==

=== Drug development ===

High throughput cancer therapeutics screens are performed ''in vitro'' without the accompanying microenvironment. However, studies also investigate the effects of supportive stroma cells and their resistance to therapy. The latter studies revealed interesting therapeutic targets in the microenvironment including [[integrins]] and [[chemokines]]. These were missed by initial screens for anti-cancer drugs and might also help explain why so few drugs are highly potent ''in vivo''.

Nanocarrier vehicles (~20–200&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter) can transport drugs and other therapeutic molecules. These therapies can be targeted to selectively extravasate through tumor vasculature via the EPR effect. Nanocarriers are now considered the gold standard of targeted cancer therapy because it can target tumors that are hypovascularized, such as prostate and pancreatic tumors.&lt;ref name= "Danhier" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sakae |last1=Unezaki |first2= Kazuo |last2=Maruyama |first3= Jun-Ichi |last3=Hosoda |first4= Itsuro |last4=Nagae |first5= Yasuhisa |last5=Koyanagi |first6= Mikiho |last6=Nakata |first7= Osamu |last7=Ishida |first8= Motoharu |last8=Iwatsuru |first9= Seishi |last9=Tsuchiya |title= Direct measurement of the extravasation of polyethyleneglycol-coated liposomes into solid tumor tissue by in vivo fluorescence microscopy |journal= International Journal of Pharmaceutics |volume= 144 |issue= 1 |date=22 November 1996 |pp= 11–17|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-5173(96)04674-1 |doi=10.1016/S0378-5173(96)04674-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts include protein [[capsids]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Seth |last1=Lilavivat  |first2= Debosmita |last2=Sardar  |first3= Subrata |last3=Jana  |first4= Geoffrey C. |last4=Thomas  |first5= Kenneth J. |last5=Woycechowsky |title= In vivo encapsulation of nucleic acids using an engineered nonviral protein capsid |journal= Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume= 134 |issue= 32 |date=15 August 2012 |pp= 13152–13155|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja302743g |doi=10.1021/ja302743g |pmid=22827162}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[liposomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Srinivas |last1=Ramishetti |first2=Leaf |last2= Huang |title= Intelligent design of multifunctional lipid-coated nanoparticle platforms for cancer therapy |journal= Therapeutic Delivery |volume= 3 |issue= 12 |date=December 2012 |pp=1429–1445|url=https://dx.doi.org/doi:10.4155/tde.12.127 |doi=10.4155/tde.12.127|pmc=3584330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as some important, normal tissues, such as the liver and kidneys, also have fenestrated endothelium, the nanocarrier size (10–100&amp;nbsp;nm, with greater retention in tumors seen in using larger nanocarriers) and charge (anionic or neutral) must be considered.&lt;ref name="Danhier" /&gt; Lymphatic vessels do not usually develop with the tumor, leading to increased [[interstitial fluid]] pressure, which may block tumor access.&lt;ref name="Danhier" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rakesh K. |last=Jain |title= Transport of molecules in the tumor interstitium: a review |journal= Cancer Research |volume= 47 |year=1987 |pp= 3039–3051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Therapies ===

==== Antibodies ====
[[Monoclonal antibody]] [[Bevacizumab]] is clinically approved in the US to treat a variety of cancers by targeting [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF-A]], which is produced by both CAFs and TAMs, thus slowing [[angiogenesis]].

Targeting immunoregulatory membrane receptors succeeded in some patients with melanoma, [[non-small-cell lung carcinoma]], urothelial bladder cancer and renal cell cancer. In mice, anti-[[CTLA-4]] therapy leads to clearance from the tumor of [[FOXP3|Foxp3]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[regulatory T cells]] (T&lt;sub&gt;reg&lt;/sub&gt; cells) whose presence may impair effector T cell function. Similarly anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy blocks the inhibitory PD-1 receptor. Other, potentially more fundamental TME inhibitory reactions (as in microsatellite stable [[colorectal cancer]], ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and PDA have yet to be overcome. The TME appears to aid in excluding killer T cells from the vicinity of cancer cells.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==== Kinase inhibitors ====
Many other small molecule [[Receptor tyrosine kinase|kinase inhibitors]] block the receptors for the growth factors released, thus making the cancer cell deaf to much of the [[paracrine]] signaling produced by CAFs and TAMs. These inhibitors include [[Sunitinib]], [[Pazopanib]], [[Sorafenib]] and [[Axitinib]], all of which inhibit [[platelet derived growth factor receptor]]s (PDGF-Rs) and [[VEGF receptors]] (VEGFRs). [[Cannabidiol]] (a [[cannabis]] derivate without psychoactive effects) has also been shown to inhibit the expression of VEGF in [[Kaposi's sarcoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Yehoshua |last1=Maor |first2= Jinlong |last2=Yu |first3= Paula M. |last3=Kuzontkoski |first4= Bruce J. |last4=Dezube |first5= Xuefeng |last5=Zhang |first6=  Jerome E. |last6=Groopman |title= Cannabidiol Inhibits Growth and Induces Programmed Cell Death in Kaposi Sarcoma–Associated Herpesvirus-Infected Endothelium |journal= Genes Cancer |volume= 7–8 |date=July 2012 |pp= 512–520|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1947601912466556 |doi=10.1177/1947601912466556|pmc=3527984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natalizumab]] is a [[monoclonal antibody]] that targets a molecule responsible for cell [[adhesion]] (integrin VLA-4) and has promising ''in vitro'' activity in B cell [[lymphomas]] and [[leukemias]].

[[Trabectedin]] has immunomodulatory effects that inhibit TAMs.&lt;ref name="Solinas" /&gt;

==== Liposomes ====
Liposome formulations that encapsulate anti-cancer drugs for selective uptake to tumors via the EPR effect include: [[Doxorubicin#Liposomal formulations|Doxil]] and [[Doxorubicin#Liposomal formulations|Myocet]], both of which encapsulate [[doxorubicin]] (a DNA intercalator and common chemotherapeutic); DaunoXome, which encapsulates [[daunorubicin]] (a similar DNA intercalator); and Onco-TCS, which encapsulates [[vincristine]] (a molecule that induces formation of microtubules, dysregulating cell division). Another novel utilization of the EPR effect comes from [[Protein-bound paclitaxel]] (marketed under the trade name Abraxane) where [[paclitaxel]] (a molecule which dysregulates cell division via stabilization of microtubules) is bound to [[albumin]] to add bulk and aid delivery.

'''WikiVet''' is a [[wiki]] of [[veterinary]] content based on the [[MediaWiki]] platform. The project is a collaborative initiative involving  [[veterinary school]]s between UK and international veterinary schools. It provides a comprehensive online knowledge base which covers the entire veterinary [[curriculum]], and is a reliable reference source for veterinary [[students]], [[Paraveterinary workers|nurses]] and graduates anywhere in the world. The WikiVet project is now part of the WikiVet Educational Foundation (registered charity number 1160546) which was established in February 2015.

==Objectives==

WikiVet's principle objectives are:

* To provide a comprehensive knowledge base covering all aspects of veterinary science for all domestic species;
* To address the entire veterinary and related curriculum in order to provide a reliable and trusted resource for students anywhere in the world;
* To use the new opportunities offered by [[e-learning]] to support professional [[lifelong learning]];
* To foster a new community of veterinary educators, learners and practitioners using [[social media]] with a common interest in [[veterinary education]];
* To create a sustainable model which ensures the long term viability and growth of the site.

==Development==

A feature of WikiVet is the level of cooperation involved between [[Academia|academics]] at different schools and the direct involvement of students. The project grew out of existing [[collaboration]]s between veterinary schools, and over 40 [[student]] and [[Graduation|graduate]] authors have worked, or are working, together writing most of the content which is then reviewed by recent graduates and/or experts in a specific field.

Although WikiVet is created in a similar way to Wikipedia, there are three distinct differences between the two. Apart from the content relating specifically to the veterinary curriculum, articles are [[peer review]]ed by subject specialists, and access to parts of the site is restricted to the veterinary community. This ensures accuracy of information and reflects the sensitive nature of much of the content.

==History==

WikiVet was established in 2007 to provide online access to a comprehensive veterinary curriculum. The consortium was initially formed by three UK veterinary schools ([[Royal Veterinary College|the Royal Veterinary College]], the [http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/vet Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies] University of Edinburgh and the [http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/vet Department of Veterinary Medicine] University of Cambridge) and was subsequently joined by Nottingham. It has now grown to include over 15 additional associated academic institutions as well as forming a close association with parts of the commercial veterinary sector. WikiVet now has a registered user base of over 45,000 members of whom about 60% are veterinary students from over 100 countries around the world.

==Content==

The WikiVet site provides an extensive knowledge base supported by interactive learning materials. This pedagogical mix of online resources has been developed based on feedback from veterinary educators and focus groups of learners. This mix has evolved with time from a multi-user generated wiki to a more complex learning package integrating curriculum resources with supplementary text and references provided by an employed team of authors. The site now has one of the largest veterinary collection of educational resources on the web. 
WikiVet continues to grow and now offers registered users free access to:

* Over 5,000 assets comprising text, diagrams and images covering topics relevant to veterinary basic sciences, clinical medicine, veterinary nursing and the general public
* Flashcards with links to WikiVet pages and commercial textbooks 
* A database of over 300 Multiple choice questions and feedback authored by subject experts 
* A comprehensive set of drag and drop exercises on a wide range of topics 
* A Facebook site and linked Twitter feed with regular updates and links to the site 
* Spanish and French sub sites with a subset of translated content 
* A video database including over 200 veterinary videos to enhance site content
* Links to key references and full text articles through the CABI database

WikiVet has been dependent on the generosity of a large number of organisations committed to supporting veterinary education. These include Mars Petcare, the  Higher Education Academy, RCVS Trust, Pfizer Global Alliances, Ceva, and the Donkey Sanctuary who have all provided funding. Other organisations which have assisted with providing content and support including Elsevier, CRC Publishing, CABI, IVIS and VetPrep. In addition colleagues and students at all the collaborating veterinary schools have been fundamental to the projects success. Finally the site has been dependent on the good will and time of numerous volunteer students and academics around the world.

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Monk Testing Wine - Antonio Casanova y Estorach.jpg|thumb|''Monk Testing Wine'' by [[:es:Antonio Casanova y Estorach|Antonio Casanova y Estorach]] (c.1886)]]
'''Wine tasting''' is the sensory examination and evaluation of [[wine]]. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as [[sommelier]]s or buyers for [[retailer]]s) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Peynaud, Émile (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzehk2Vu5K8C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=_9nIRvLrCJSS7QKiu9zfDw&amp;sig=LmyRAwE8FKHf-N4Bz3rOWXEkGsY#PPA2,M1  ''The Taste of Wine: The Art and Science of Wine Appreciation'', London: Macdonald Orbis, p1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Results contradicting the reliability of wine tasting in both experts and consumers have surfaced through scientific [[blind wine tasting]], such as inconsistency in identifying wines based on region and price.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Robert T., [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8545711 "How Expert are "Expert" Wine Judges?"], ''Journal of Wine Economics'', Vol. 4; Issue 02 (Winter 2009), pp. 233–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Sumer|Sumerian]] stories of [[Gilgamesh]] in the 3rd millennium BCE differentiate the popular beers of [[Mesopotamia]], as well as wines from [[Zagros Mountains]] or [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;Émile Peynaud, '' The taste of wine '', p.1 Dunod, 2013 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Wfb7AAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=le%20gout%20du%20vin%20peynaud&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google books link]&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth century BCE, [[Plato]] listed the main flavors of wine, and classified the aromas as "species", or families.

[[Aristotle]] proposed a sensory tasting defined by the [[four elements]] (air, water, fire, and earth) further deepened by the Roman noblewoman [[Lucretia]] in the first century BCE.

Although the practice of tasting is as old as the history of wine, the term "tasting" first appeared in 1519.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tasting: Definition and etymology | url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/degustation | website=cnrtl.fr | date = | accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methodology of wine tasting was formalized by the 18th century when [[Linnaeus]], Poncelet, and others brought an understanding of tasting up to date.

In 2004, [[Richard Axel]] and [[Linda B. Buck]], won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their contribution to the knowledge of the senses of taste and smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Cell |date=1991 Apr 5 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=175-87 |pmid=1840504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tasting stages==
[[File:Porto.Grahams02.jpg|thumb|right|Ready tasting room of [[port wine]] in a [[wine cellar]] of a producer]]
The results of the four recognized stages to wine tasting:
* appearance
* "in glass" the [[aroma of the wine]]
* "in mouth" sensations
* "finish" ([[aftertaste]])&lt;ref&gt;Ronald S. Jackson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=n0z8XCvAS9EC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=md3IRrebI5SE7AKk6tzfDw&amp;sig=_ynh2E9B7eRT7ta9AbrpOL5qpaE#PPA2,M1 ''Wine Tasting: A Professional Handbook'', pp 2–3]&lt;/ref&gt;
– are combined in order to establish the following properties of a wine: 
* complexity and character
* potential (suitability for [[aging (wine)|aging]] or drinking)
* possible [[Wine fault|faults]]
A wine's overall quality assessment, based on this examination, follows further careful description and comparison with recognized standards, both with respect to other wines in its price range and according to known factors pertaining to the region or vintage; if it is typical of the region or diverges in style; if it uses certain [[wine-making]] techniques, such as barrel [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] or [[malolactic fermentation]], or any other remarkable or unusual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Peynaud, Émile (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=nzehk2Vu5K8C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=wine+tasting+aims&amp;ei=_9nIRvLrCJSS7QKiu9zfDw&amp;sig=LmyRAwE8FKHf-N4Bz3rOWXEkGsY#PPA2,M1  ''The Taste of Wine: The Art and Science of Wine Appreciation'', London: Macdonald Orbis, p2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NorCal2018 Castello di Amorosa Wine Tasting Napa Valley S0151015.jpg|thumb|Wine tasting at [[Castello di Amorosa]], Napa Valley]]

Whereas wines are regularly tasted in isolation, a wine's quality assessment is more objective when performed alongside several other wines, in what are known as tasting "flights". Wines may be deliberately selected for their [[vintage]] ("horizontal" tasting) or proceed from a single [[winery]] ("vertical" tasting), to better compare [[vineyard]] and vintages, respectively. Alternatively, in order to promote an unbiased analysis, bottles and even glasses may be disguised in a "blind" tasting, to rule out any prejudicial awareness of either vintage or winery.

==Blind tasting==
{{Main|Blind wine tasting}}
To ensure impartial judgment of a wine, it should be served ''blind'' – that is, without the taster(s) having seen the label or bottle shape. Blind tasting may also involve serving the wine from a black wine glass to mask the [[wine color|color]] of the wine. A taster's judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, price, reputation, color, or other considerations.

Scientific research has long demonstrated the [[Placebo|power of suggestion in perception]] as well as the strong effects of expectancies. For example, people expect more expensive wine to have more desirable characteristics than less expensive wine. When given wine that they are falsely told is expensive they virtually always report it as tasting better than the very same wine when they are told that it is inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928231853/http://www.academie-amorim.com/us/laureat_2001/brochet.pdf Chemical Object Representation in the Field of Consciousness – Frédéric Brochet]&lt;/ref&gt; French researcher Frédéric Brochet "submitted a mid-range Bordeaux in two different bottles, one labeled as a cheap table wine, the other bearing a grand cru etiquette." Tasters described the supposed grand cru as "woody, complex, and round" and the supposed cheap wine as  "short, light, and faulty."

Similarly, people have expectations about wines because of their [[List of wine producing regions|geographic origin]], [[winery|producer]], vintage, color, and many other factors. For example, when Brochet served a white wine he received all the usual descriptions: "fresh, dry, honeyed, lively." Later he served the same wine dyed red and received the usual red terms: "intense, spicy, supple, deep."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210308/http://www.seattleweekly.com/2002-02-20/news/wine-snob-scandal.php Wine Snob Scandal – Brochet's work on dyed wine]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous instances of blind testing is known as the [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]], a [[wine competition]] held in 1976 where French judges blind-tested wines from [[France]] and [[California]]. Against all expectations, [[California wines]] bested [[French wines]] according to the judges, a result which would have been unlikely in a non-blind contest. This event was depicted in the 2008 movie ''[[Bottle Shock]]''.

===Price bias===
Another well-publicized double-blind taste test was conducted in 2011 by [[Richard Wiseman|Prof. Richard Wiseman]] of the [[University of Hertfordshire]].  In a wine tasting experiment using 400 participants, Wiseman found that general members of the public were unable to distinguish expensive wines from inexpensive ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Georgiou | first = Maroulla | title = Expensive and inexpensive wines taste the same, research shows | publisher = [[Phys.Org]] | date = Apr 15, 2011 | url = http://phys.org/news/2011-04-expensive-inexpensive-wines.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "People just could not tell the difference between cheap and expensive wine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Sample | first = Ian | title = Expensive wine and cheap plonk taste the same to most people | publisher = The Guardian | date = April 14, 2011 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/apr/14/expensive-wine-cheap-plonk-taste?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color bias===
In 2001, the [[University of Bordeaux]] asked 54 undergraduate students to test two glasses of wine: one red, one white. The participants described the red as "jammy" and commented on its crushed red fruit.  The participants failed to recognize that both wines were from the same bottle.  The only difference was that one had been colored red with a flavorless dye.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/wine-tasting-junk-science-analysis Wine-tasting: it's junk science; The Guardian; June 22, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0093934X01924939/1-s2.0-S0093934X01924939-main.pdf?_tid=c6c9ffa6-bc7a-11e5-ae11-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1452967301_69c3ad144ba81882e1b68bbb498d79d2 The Colour of Odors; Morrot, Brochet and Dubourdeiu; 28 August 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Geographic origin bias===
For 6 years, [[Texas A&amp;M University]] invited people to taste wines labeled "France", "California", "Texas", and while nearly all ranked the French as best, in fact, all three were the same Texan wine.  The contest is built on the simple theory that if people do not know what they are drinking, they award points differently than if they do know what they are drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/2005-04-08/265667/ Liquid Assets - A fair competition; The Austin Chronicle; April 8, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vertical and horizontal tasting==
'''Vertical and horizontal wine tastings''' are wine tasting events that are arranged to highlight differences between similar wines.
* In a '''vertical tasting''', different vintages of the same [[Wine#Wine styles|wine type]] from the same winery are tasted. This emphasizes differences between various vintages.
* In a '''horizontal tasting''', the wines are all from the same vintage but are from different wineries. Keeping wine variety or type and [[List of wine producing regions|wine region]] the same helps emphasize differences in winery styles.

==Tasting flights==
'''Tasting flight''' is a term used by wine tasters to describe a selection of wines, usually between three and eight glasses, but sometimes as many as fifty, presented for the purpose of sampling and comparison.

==Tasting notes==
A '''tasting note''' refers to a taster's written testimony about the aroma, taste identification, acidity, structure, texture, and balance of a wine. Online wine communities like [[Bottlenotes]] allow members to maintain their tasting notes online and for the reference of others.

==Serving temperature==
The temperature that a wine is served at can greatly affect the way it tastes and smells. Lower temperatures will emphasize [[acidity]] and [[tannins (wine)|tannin]]s while muting the [[aromatic]]s. Higher temperatures will minimize acidity and tannins while increasing the aromatics.

== Glassware ==
{{Main|Wine glass}}
The shape of a wineglass can have a subtle impact on the perception of wine, especially its bouquet.&lt;ref name="glass1"&gt;Huttenbrink, K., Schmidt, C., Delwiche, J., &amp; Hummel, T. (2001). The aroma of red wine is modified by the form of the wine glass. ''Laryno-Rhino-Otologie'', 80(2), 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glass2"&gt;Delwiche, J., &amp; Pelchat, M. (2002). Influence of glass shape on wine aroma. ''Journal of Sensory Studies'', 17(1), 19–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glass3"&gt;Hummel, T., Delwiche, J., Schmidt, C., &amp; Huttenbrink, K. (2003). Effects of the form of glasses on the perception of wine flavors: a study in untrained subjects. ''Appetite'', 41(2), 197–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the ideal shape is considered to be wider toward the bottom, with a narrower aperture at the top (tulip or egg shaped). Glasses which are widest at the top are considered the least ideal. Many wine tastings use [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] XL5 glasses,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} which are "egg"-shaped. The effect of glass shape does not appear to be related to whether the glass is pleasing to look at.&lt;ref name="glass3"/&gt;

== Wine color ==
Without having tasted the wines, one does not know if, for example, a white is heavy or light. Before taking a sip, the taster tries to determine the order in which the wines should be assessed by appearance and nose alone. Heavy wines will be deeper in [[wine color|color]] and generally more intense on the nose. Sweeter wines, being denser, will leave thick, [[viscous]] streaks (called ''legs'' or ''[[Tears of wine|tears]]'') down the inside of the glass when swirled.

==Process==
[[File:Tempranillowine.jpg|thumb|right|Judging [[wine color|color]] is the first step in tasting wine.]]
There are five basic steps in tasting wine: color, swirl, smell, taste, and savor.&lt;ref name=course&gt;Zraly, Kevin. ''Windows on the World: Complete Wine Course''; Sterling Publishing, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also known as the "five S" steps: see, swirl, sniff, sip, savor. During this process, a taster must look for clarity, varietal character, integration, expressiveness, complexity, and connectedness.&lt;ref name=winebible&gt;MacNeil, Karen. ''The Wine Bible''; Workman Publishing, New York (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

A wine's color is better judged by putting it against a white background. The wine glass is put at an angle in order to see the colors. Colors can give the taster clues to the grape variety, and whether the wine was aged in wood.

===Characteristics assessed during tasting===
Varietal character describes how much a wine presents its inherent grape aromas.&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt; A wine taster also looks for integration, which is a state in which none of the components of the wine ([[Acids in wine|acid]], tannin, alcohol, etc.) is out of balance with the other components. When a wine is well balanced, the wine is said to have achieved a harmonious fusion.&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt;

Another important quality of the wine to look for is its expressiveness. Expressiveness is the quality the "wine possesses when its aromas and flavors are well-defined and clearly projected."&lt;ref name=winebible5&gt;MacNeil, Karen. ''The Wine Bible''; Workman Publishing, New York, p.5 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of the wine is affected by many factors, one of which may be the multiplicity of its flavors. The connectedness of the wine, a rather abstract and difficult to ascertain quality, describes the bond between the wine and its land of origin (terroir).&lt;ref name="winebible"/&gt;

===Connoisseur wine tasting===
A wine's quality can be judged by its bouquet and taste. The bouquet is the total aromatic experience of the wine. Assessing a wine's bouquet can also reveal faults such as [[cork taint]]; [[oxidation]] due to age, overexposure to oxygen, or lack of preservatives; and wild [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] or bacterial contamination, such as those due to [[Acetobacter]] or ''[[Brettanomyces]]'' yeasts.  Although low levels of ''Brettanomyces'' aromatic characteristics can be a positive attribute, giving the wine a distinctive character, generally it is considered a wine spoilage yeast.

The bouquet of wine is best revealed by gently swirling the wine in a wine glass to expose it to more oxygen and release more [[aromaticity|aromatic]]&lt;ref name=Gluckstern&gt;{{cite book | last=Gluckstern |first=Willie |title=The Wine Avenger |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; etheric, ester, and aldehyde molecules that comprise the essential components of a wine's bouquet.&lt;ref name=course/&gt; [[Sparkling wine]] should not be swirled to the point of releasing bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maisons-champagne.com/encyclopedie/vignes_au_plaisir/erreurs.htm |title=Eviter les erreurs Encyclopédie des Vignes au plaisir |publisher=Maisons-champagne.com |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pausing to experience a wine's bouquet aids the wine taster in anticipating the wine's flavors. The "nose" of a wine – its bouquet or aroma – is the major determinate of perceived flavor in the mouth. Once inside the mouth, the aromatics are further liberated by exposure to body heat, and transferred [[Human nose|retronasally]] to the [[olfactory receptor]] site. It is here that the complex taste experience characteristic of a wine actually commences.

Thoroughly tasting a wine involves perception of its array of taste and [[mouthfeel]] attributes, which involve the combination of textures, flavors, weight, and overall "structure". Following appreciation of its olfactory characteristics, the wine taster savors a wine by holding it in the mouth for a few seconds to saturate the [[taste bud]]s. By pursing ones lips and breathing through that small opening oxygen will pass over the wine and release even more esters. When the wine is allowed to pass slowly through the mouth it presents the connoisseur with the fullest gustatory profile available to the human palate.

The acts of pausing and focusing through each step distinguishes wine tasting from simple quaffing. Through this process, the full array of aromatic molecules is captured and interpreted by approximately 15 million olfactory receptors,&lt;ref name=Gluckstern /&gt; comprising a few hundred olfactory receptor classes. When tasting several wines in succession, however, key aspects of this fuller experience (length and finish, or aftertaste) must necessarily be sacrificed through expectoration.

Although taste qualities are known to be widely distributed throughout the oral cavity, the concept of an anatomical "[[tongue map]]" yet persists in the wine tasting arena, in which different tastes are believed to map to different areas of the tongue. A widely accepted example is the misperception that the tip of the tongue uniquely tells how sweet a wine is and the upper edges tell its acidity.&lt;ref name=Gluckstern /&gt;

==Scoring wine==
{{main|wine rating}}
{{See also|Wine tasting descriptors}}
As part of the tasting process, and as a way of comparing the merits of the various wines, wines are given scores according to a relatively set system. This may be either by explicitly weighting different aspects, or by global judgment (although the same aspects would be considered). These aspects are 1) the appearance of the wine, 2) the nose or smell, 3) the palate or taste, and 4) overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepros.org/wine101/sensory_guide.htm Professional Friends of Wine]&lt;/ref&gt; Different systems weight these differently (e.g., appearance 15%, nose 35%, palate 50%). Typically, no modern wine would score less than half on any scale (which would effectively indicate an obvious fault). It is more common for wines to be scored out of 20 (including half marks) in Europe and parts of Australasia, and out of 100 in the US. However, different critics tend to have their own preferred system, and some gradings are also given out of 5 (again with half marks).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wine-searcher.com/wine-scores.lml Wine-Searcher]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visiting wineries ==
Traveling to wine regions is one way of increasing skill in tasting. Many wine producers in wine regions all over the world offer tastings of their wine. Depending on the country or region, tasting at the winery may incur a small charge to allow the producer to cover costs.

It is not considered rude to spit out wine at a winery, even in the presence of the wine maker or owner. Generally, a [[spittoon]] will be provided. In some regions of the world, tasters simply spit on the floor or onto gravel surrounding barrels. It is polite to inquire about where to spit before beginning tasting.

== Attending wine schools ==
A growing number of wine schools can be found, offering wine tasting classes to the public. These programs often help a wine taster hone and develop their abilities in a controlled setting. Some also offer professional training for sommeliers and winemakers. It is even possible to learn how to assess wine methodically via e-learning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wine Campus]] offers an Honours Brevet via e-learning&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expectoration ==
[[File:Crachoir by JM Rosier.JPG|thumb|upright|Spitting into a [[spittoon]] at a wine tasting.]]
Because intoxication can affect the consumer's judgment, wine tasters generally spit the wine out after they have assessed its quality at formal tastings, where dozens of wines may be assessed. However, since wine is absorbed through the skin inside the mouth, tasting from twenty to twenty-five samplings can still produce an intoxicating effect, depending on the alcoholic content of the wine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Walton| first =Stuart| title =Cook's Encyclopedia of Wine| year=2005| publisher =Anness Publishing Limited 2002, 2005| pages = 10, 11| isbn = 0-7607-4220-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sensory analysis ==
Tasting plays an important role in the [[sensory analysis]] (also referred to as [[organoleptic]] analysis) of wine. Employing a [[trained panel|trained]] or consumer panel, [[Oenology|oenologists]] may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. [[Discrimination testing|Difference tests]] are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.

== Grape varieties ==
Wine grape varieties are variously evaluated according to a wide range of descriptors which draw comparisons with other, non-grape flavors and aromas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winepros.org/wine101/grape_profiles/varietals.htm Varietal Profiles | Professional Friends of Wine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winestore.com/grape-varieties.php Grape Varieties Explained&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The following table provides a brief and by no means exhaustive summary of typical descriptors for the better-known varietals.

[[File:One Future ZeroHunger.jpg|thumb|An image produced as part of the [[World Food Programme|World Food Programme's]] social media campaign for World Food Day in 2015.]]
'''World Food Day''' is celebrated every year around the world on 16 October in honor of the date of the founding of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] in 1945. The day is celebrated widely by many other organizations concerned with [[food security]], including the [[World Food Programme]] and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]].

The World Food Day theme for 2014 was Family Farming: "Feeding the world, caring for the earth"; in 2015 it was "Social Protection and Agriculture: Breaking the Cycle of Rural Poverty"; in 2016 it is Climate Change: "Climate is changing. Food and agriculture must too",&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.fao.org/world-food-day/2016/theme/en/ UN's World Food Day website, accessed 15 September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; which echoes the theme of 2008, and of 2002 and 1989 before that..

==Origins==
[[File:Washington Park Building.JPG|thumb|U.S. National Committee for World Food Day offices in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
'''World Food Day''' (WFD) was established by FAO's Member Countries at the Organization's 20th General Conference in November 1979. The Hungarian Delegation, led by the former Hungarian Minister of Agriculture and Food Dr. [[Pál Romány]], played an active role at the 20th Session of the FAO Conference and suggested the idea of celebrating the WFD worldwide.
It has since been observed every year in more than 150 countries, [[raising awareness]] of the issues behind poverty and hunger.

===Themes===

Since 1981, World Food Day has adopted a different theme each year in order to highlight areas needed for action and provide a common focus.

Most of the themes revolve around agriculture because only investment in agriculture – together with support for education and health – will turn this situation around. The bulk of that investment will have to come from the private sector, with public investment playing a crucial role, especially in view of its facilitating and stimulating effect on private investment.

In spite of the importance of agriculture as the driving force in the economies of many developing countries, this vital sector is frequently starved of investment. In particular, foreign aid to agriculture has shown marked declines over the past 20 years.
