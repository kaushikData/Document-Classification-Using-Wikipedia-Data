'''Fractures of the acetabulum''' occur when the head of the [[femur]] is driven into the [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. This injury is caused by a blow to either the side or front of the [[knee]] and often occurs as a [[dashboard]] injury accompanied by a fracture of the femur.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, APLEY'S TRAUMA AND ORTHOPAEDICS, EIGHT EDITION,&lt;/ref&gt;

The acetabulum is a cavity situated on the outer surface of the hip bone, also called the coxal bone or innominate bone. It is made up of three bones, the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[ischium]], and [[pubis (bone)|pubis]]. Together, the acetabulum and head of the [[femur]] form the [[hip joint]].

Fractures of the acetabulum in young individuals usually result from a high energy injury like vehicular accident or feet first fall. In older individuals or those with osteoporosis, a trivial fall may result in acetabular fracture.

In 1964, French surgeons Robertt Judet, Jean Judet, and Emile Letournel first described the mechanism, classification, and treatment of acetabular fracture. They classified these fractures into elementary (simple two part) and associated (complex three or more part) fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orthoconsult.com/classify-acetabular-fractures/|title=How to Classify Acetabular Fractures|last=OrthoConsult|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy==
To understand the fracture pattern of a fractured acetabulum, it is essential to have minimum three x-ray views, though use of CT scan with 3-D reconstruction of images has made understanding of these fractures easier.
#''Pelvis with both hips antero posterior view''. This view shows six important landmarks of the acetabulum, specifically:
#* Pelvic brim
#*Ilio ischial line
#*Tear drop
#*Anterior wall
#*Posterior wall
#*Weight bearing dome
#''Iliac oblique view''. This view shows the whole of the ilium, the posterior column, and the anterior wall
#''Obturator oblique view''. Shows the anterior column and the posterior wall.

===Patterns of fracture===
Tile's classification of acetabular fracture:

*I - Simple fracture, [[anterior wall|anterior]] or [[Mastoid wall of tympanic cavity|posterior wall]] column
*II - [[Transverse fracture]]
*III - T - Type fracture involving two columns
*IV - Both columns fractures, floating acetabulum

==Judet-Letournel classification==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Elementary fracture !!Description !! Associated fractures !! Description
|-
| Posterior wall || This is the most common variety of acetabular fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orthoconsult.com/classify-acetabular-fractures/|title=How to Classify Acetabular Fractures {{!}} OrthoConsult|date=2017-05-28|work=OrthoConsult|access-date=2017-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically occurs due to dashboard injury; when a person travelling in a vehicle involved in head-on collision, the force applied over the flexed knee travels along the femur bone to the head of femur  breaking the posterior wall of the acetabulum. The head of the femur is dislocated outside the joint.
|| T shape || When a transverse fracture also had a vertical fracture line, it is called a T shape fracture. Here the innominate bone is broken in such a way that all three parts of it, the Ilium, the Ischium and the Pubis are separated from one another. This is a three part fracture. Though both columns are broken, still the weight bearing dome is still attached to main ilium and hence it is not a true both column fracture.

This fracture may be associated with fracture through the posterior wall as well, making it more complex. Typically occurs when the injuring force is applied from the side, against the greater trochanter of the femur bone, as in a fall on the side or being hit on the side. This force may be combined with dash board injury as well. Fracture is best seen in Antero posterior view and Iliac and obturator oblique views.
|-
| Posterior column || As with posterior wall injury, this also typically occurs due to dash board injury.
|| Posterior column + Posterior wall || These fractures are extension of elementary fractures. With involvement of posterior wall, the difficulty in treatment increases. These fractures are rarely amenable to non-surgical treatment. Due to posterior wall fracture, the hip is usually dislocated posteriorly, requiring immediate reduction of dislocation and surgical reconstruction after few days.

Posterior column with posterior wall fracture occurs due to dash board injury. Antero posterior view may give clue to these injuries, Judet views and CT scan help in knowing the extent of injury.
|-
| Anterior wall ||  This fracture is uncommon, typically occurring when the injuring force is applied from the side, against the greater trochanter of the femur bone, as in a fall on the side or being hit on the side.
||Transverse + posterior wall || These fractures are extension of elementary fractures. With involvement of posterior wall, the difficulty in treatment increases. These fractures are rarely amenable to non-surgical treatment. Due to posterior wall fracture, the hip is usually dislocated posteriorly, requiring immediate reduction of dislocation and surgical reconstruction after few days.

Occurs due to combined dash board injury and direct injury to the hip from the side.
|-
| Anterior column || This fracture is uncommon, typically occurring when the injuring force is applied from the side, against the greater trochanter of the femur bone, as in a fall on the side or being hit on the side. Depending on the location, the fractures are described as very low, low, intermediate and high anterior column fracture.
|| Anterior column + posterior hemi transverse ||  In this variety of fracture, the posterior or ilio ischial column is broken as a transverse fracture while the anterior or ilio pubic column is broken into multiple pieces. Part of the weight bearing dome in this variety of fracture is still attached to that part of iliac wing which is forms part of sacro iliac joint.  This type of injury has to be differentiated from both column fracture, where in the weight bearing dome is a floating piece not attached directly to bone forming sacro iliac joint

Typically caused by a combination of forces acting on the hip though the femoral head. All three x-ray views plus CT scan is a must for diagnosis and management of this complex injury. In this injury, non-operative treatment rarely gives satisfactory results. Surgical management is ideal. The choice of approach rests with the surgeon, but going from front, or anterior approach is must. The posterior injury may be tacked with anterior approach by experienced surgeon. If the patient is unfit to undergo major surgery due to any reason, longitudinal traction to achieve secondary congruence of hip may help to restore hip function, though partially.
|-
| Transverse || In this variety of fracture, the innominate bone is broken such that the upper part consists of ilium with weight bearing dome and the lower part consists of ischium and pubic bones. It typically occurs when the injuring force is applied from the side, against the greater trochanter of the femur bone, as in a fall on the side or being hit on the side. This is a two part fracture, but though both columns are broken, it is not a true both-column fracture, as the weight bearing dome is still attached to main ilium.
In this variety of fracture, the innominate bone is broken such that the upper part consists of ilium with weight bearing dome and the lower part consists of ischium and pubic bones.

This is a two part fracture, but though both columns are broken, it is not a true both-column fracture, as the weight bearing dome is still attached to main ilium.

Depending on the level at which the fracture line passes in relation to weight bearing area, the transverse fracture is further subdivided into types:
#''Infra tectal'': below the weight bearing dome
#''Juxta tectal'': just at the level of the weight bearing dome
#''Trans tectal'': passing through the weight bearing dome

;Diagnosis
X-ray visualization is best done in Antero posterior view and Iliac and obturator oblique views. In CT scan the characteristic feature is that the fracture line runs from front to back. CT scan also helps in identifying impaction of bone pieces and if there are pieces in the joint
||Combined both column fractures || These are the most complex injuries. Here the weight bearing roof or dome of the acetabulum is a floating piece. This adds to complexity of management.
;Diagnosis
All three x-ray views plus CT scan is a must for diagnosis and management of this complex injury.

;Treatment
Like any other acetabular fracture, if the femoral head is dislocated out of the socket, early reduction into socket is a priority. However, in this injury, non-operative treatment rarely gives satisfactory results. Surgical management is ideal. The choice of approach rests with the surgeon, but going from front, or anterior approach is must. The posterior injury may be tacked with anterior approach by experienced surgeon. If the patient is unfit to undergo major surgery due to any reason, longitudinal traction to achieve secondary congruence of hip may help to restore hip function, though partially.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
===Diagnosis===
Ideal x-ray visualization of an elementary fracture will depend on the fracture type:
*'''Posterior wall fracture:''' Iliac oblique and obturator oblique views
*'''Posterior column fracture:''' Iliac oblique and obturator oblique views
*'''Anterior wall fracture:''' Iliac oblique view
*'''Anterior column fracture:''' Obturator oblique view 
In all cases, CT scan can assist in identifying impacted bone pieces, which may be found within the joint, and MRI may be done to identify the extent of potential injury to the sciatic nerve.

===Associated injuries and complications===
The broken bone pieces or the dislocated head of the femur may injure the [[sciatic nerve]], causing paralysis of the foot; the patient may or may not recover sensation in the foot, depending on the extent of injury to the nerve. The posterior wall fragment may be one large piece, or multiple pieces, and may be associated with impaction of the bone. Sciatic nerve injury and stoppage of blood supply to femoral head at the time of accident or during surgery to treat may occur. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are other complications that may occur in any type of injury to the acetabulum.

===Treatment===
If the femur head is dislocated, it should be reduced as soon as possible, to prevent damage to its blood supply. This is preferably done under anaesthesia, following which, leg is kept pulled by applying traction to prevent joint from dislocating.

The final management depends on the size of the fragment(s), stability and congruence of the joint. In some cases traction for six to eight weeks may be the only treatment required; however, surgical fixation using screw(s) and plate(s) may be required if the injury is more complex. The latter treatment will be called for if bone fragments do not fall into place, or if they are found in the joint, or if the joint itself is unstable.

===Post-surgery treatment and prognosis===
Depending on the stability achieved via initial treatment, the patient may be allowed to stand and walk with help of support within about six to eight weeks. Full function may return in about three months.

==Principles of management==
At the site of injury: After stabilizing an injured person and resuscitation, quick examination is done to check injury to vital organs.

If one suspects injury to the hip, it is imperative to immobilse the limb using some kind of support to prevent movements of the injured limb to prevent further damage

A trained paramedic may be able to diagnose hip dislocation by noticing the position of the injured limb. It is essential to document status of nerves and vessels before starting any treatment to protect oneself from litigation

On arrival at the hospital, trained trauma surgeon will assess the patient and prescribe necessary tests including x-rays as described earlier.

Non-surgical management consists of reducing the dislocated joint by maneuver under anaesthesia and applying traction to the limb to maintain position of joint and fractured bones. If non surgical management is preferred it may require six weeks to 3 months for recovery.

===Surgical management===
The surgical management requires high degree of training and well equipped centre. It should be carried out by experienced surgical team to get best results. The principles laid down for management are;
*  Anatomic reduction of the fractured fragments
* Stable fixation
* Congruent joint
* Early mobilization
* Delayed weight bearing
Innominate bone is a flat bone with many curves. In most part the bone is thick enough and has broad surfaces that are amenable to primary fixation using lag screw(s) and to neutralize forces across the bone one needs to add plate(s) on the surface of the fractured fragments for it to heal without deformity.

Before surgery, patient needs tests to check fitness for surgery

Anaesthesia : the surgery may be performed either under regional anaesthesia or general anaesthesia

Surgical approaches. Following are the common approaches;
*Kocher Langenbeck approach for posterior injuries
*Ili inguinal, Ilio femoral of modified stoppa’s approach for anterior or combined injuries
Implants : normally lag screws and reconstruction plates are preferred implants

Post operative management: would involve initial period or bed rest, followed by mobilsation by trained therapist

Total time to recover may be up to 3 months

During the growth of the ancient [[civilization]]s, '''ancient technology''' was the result from advances in [[engineering]] in [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. These advances in the [[history of technology]] stimulated societies to adopt new ways of living and governance.

This article includes the advances in technology and the development of several engineering arts in [[historic times]] before the [[Middle Ages]], which began after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in [[Anno Domini|AD]] 476,&lt;ref&gt;Clare, I.

{{Ancient technology}}

A significant number of [[Inventions in the Islamic world|inventions were developed in the Islamic world]]; a geopolitical region that has at times extended from [[al-Andalus]] and Africa in the west to the Indian subcontinent and [[Malay Archipelago]] in the east. Many of these inventions had direct implications for [[Fiqh]] related issues.

== Ancient civilizations ==

=== Mesopotamia ===

They were one of the first [[Bronze age]] people in the world. Early on they used [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[gold]], and later they used [[iron]]. Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals. Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for [[armor]] as well as for different weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s.

According to the assyriologist [[Stephanie Dalley]], the earliest [[pump]] was the [[Archimedes' screw]], first used by [[Sennacherib]], King of [[Assyria]], for the [[Domestic water system|water systems]] at the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] and [[Nineveh]] in the 7th century BCE. This attribution, however, is refuted by the historian of ancient water-lifting devices Olseon in the same paper, who still credits, as well as most other scholars, [[Archimedes]] with the invention.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Dalley and [[John Peter Oleson]] (January 2003). "Sennacherib, Archimedes, and the Water Screw: The Context of Invention in the Ancient World", ''Technology and Culture'' '''44''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oleson"&gt;{{Cite book

Perhaps the most important advance made by the [[Mesopotamia]]ns was the [[Cuneiform|invention of writing]] by the [[Sumer]]ians. With the invention of writing came the first recorded laws called the [[Code of Hammurabi]] as well as the first major piece of literature called the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].

Although archaeologists don't know for sure who invented the wheel, the oldest wheel discovered was found in Mesopotamia. It is likely the Sumer first used the wheel in making pottery in 3500BC and used it for their chariots in around 3200 BC.

The Mesopotamians used a [[sexagesimal]] number system with the base 60 (like we use base 10). They divided time up by 60s including a 60-second minute and a 60-minute hour, which we still use today. They also divided up the circle into 360 degrees. They had a wide knowledge of mathematics including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, quadratic and cubic equations, and fractions. This was important in keeping track of records as well as in some of their large building projects. The Mesopotamians had formulas for figuring out the circumference and area for different geometric shapes like rectangles, circles, and triangles. Some evidence suggests that they even knew the Pythagorean Theorem long before Pythagoras wrote it down. They may have even discovered the number for pi in figuring the circumference of a circle.

[[Babylonian astronomy]] was able to follow the movements of the stars, planets, and the Moon. Application of advanced math predicted the movements of several planets.  By studying the phases of the Moon, the Mesopotamians created the first [[calendar]]. It had 12 lunar months and was the predecessor for both the [[Jewish calendar|Jewish]] and [[Greek calendar]]s.

[[Babylonian medicine]] used logic and recorded medical history to be able to diagnose and treat illnesses with various creams and pills. Mesopotamians had two kinds of medical practices, magical and physical. Unlike today they would use both on the same patient. They didn’t see it as one as good and one as bad.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alan Chadwick, ''First Civilization: Ancient Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt (2)'' (London: Equinox Publishing Ltd, 2005), 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mesopotamians made many technological discoveries. They were the first to use the potter's wheel to make better pottery, they used irrigation to get water to their crops, they used bronze metal (and later iron metal) to make strong tools and weapons, and used looms to weave cloth from wool.

For later medieval technologies developed in the Mesopotamian region, now known as [[Iraq]], see [[Inventions in medieval Islam]].

===Egypt===
[[File:TurinPapyrus1.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Left half of the Turin papyrus map, courtesy J. Harrell]]
The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many simple machines, such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] to aid construction processes. They were among the first to extract [[gold]] by large-scale mining using [[fire-setting]], and the first recognisable [[map]], the [[Turin papyrus]] shows the plan of one such mine in [[Nubia]].

Egyptian [[paper]], made from [[papyrus]], and [[pottery]] were mass-produced and exported throughout the Mediterranean basin. The [[wheel]], however, did not arrive until foreign invaders introduced the [[chariot]]. They developed Mediterranean [[maritime history|maritime]] technology including ships and lighthouses. Early construction techniques utilized by the Ancient Egyptians made use of bricks composed mainly of clay, sand, silt, and other minerals. These constructs would have been vital in flood control and irrigation, especially along the Nile delta.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Trzciñski , Malgorzata Zaremba , Sawomir Rzepka , Fabian Welc , and Tomasz Szczepañski. “Preliminary Report on Engineering Properties and Environmental Resistance of Ancient Mud Bricks from Tell El-retaba Archaeological Site in the Nile Delta,” ''Studia Quarternaria'' 33, no. 1 (2016): 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

For later technologies in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Ægyptus|Roman Egypt]], and [[History of Arab Egypt|Arab Egypt]], see [[Ancient Greek technology]], [[Roman technology]] and [[Inventions in medieval Islam]] respectively.

===Africa===
{{main|Science and technology in Africa}}
Technology in Africa has a history stretching to the beginning of the human species, stretching back to the first evidence of [[Stone Age|tool use]] by hominid ancestors in the [[Hominid evolution|areas of Africa]] where humans are believed to have evolved. Africa saw the advent of some of the earliest [[ironworking]] technology in the [[Aïr Mountains]] region of what is today [[Niger]] and the erection of some of the world's oldest monuments, pyramids and towers in [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]], and [[History of North Africa|North Africa]]. In Nubia and ancient Kush, glazed quartzite and building in brick was developed to a greater extent than in Egypt. Parts of the East African [[Swahili Coast]] saw the creation of the world's oldest [[carbon steel]] creation with high-temperature [[blast furnace]]s created by the [[Haya people]] of Tanzania.

=== Indian subcontinent ===
{{main|History of Indian Science and Technology|List of Indian inventions}}
{{See also|List of inventions and discoveries of the Indus Valley Civilization}}

The [[history of Science and Technology in India|history of science and technology in India]] dates back to the earliest civilizations of the world. The Indus Valley civilization yields evidence of [[mathematics]], [[hydrography]], [[metrology]], and sewage collection and disposal being practiced by its inhabitants.

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]], situated in a resource-rich area, is notable for its early application of city planning and sanitation technologies. Cities in the Indus Valley offer some of the first examples of closed gutters, public baths, and communal granaries. The [[Takshashila]] University was an important seat of learning in the ancient world. It was the center of education for scholars from all over Asia. Many [[Greeks|Greek]], Persian and [[China|Chinese]] students studied here under great scholars including [[Kautilya]], Panini, [[Jivaka]], and Vishnu Sharma.
[[File:Mohenjo-daro.jpg|thumb|200px|Excavated ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]], Pakistan.]]

The ancient system of medicine in India, [[Ayurveda]] was a significant milestone in Indian history. It mainly uses herbs as medicines. Its origins can be traced back to origin of [[Atharvaveda]]. The [[Sushruta Samhita]] (400 BC) by Sushruta has details about performing cataract surgery, plastic surgery, etc.

Ancient India was also at the forefront of seafaring technology - a panel found at [[Mohenjo-daro]], depicts a sailing craft. Ship construction is vividly described in the Yukti Kalpa Taru, an ancient Indian text on Shipbuilding. (The Yukti Kalpa Taru had been translated and published by Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit [[Manuscripts]]').

Indian construction and architecture, called '[[Vaastu Shastra]]', suggests a thorough understanding or materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation. Ancient Indian culture was also pioneering in its use of vegetable dyes, cultivating plants including [[indigo]] and [[cinnabar]]. Many of the dyes were used in art and sculpture. The use of [[perfume]]s demonstrates some knowledge of [[chemistry]], particularly [[distillation]] and purification processes.

=== China ===
{{main|History of science and technology in China|List of Chinese inventions}}
[[File:ArmillarySphere1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Chinese [[armillary sphere]]]]

The [[history of science and technology in China]] shows significant advances in science, technology, mathematics, and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets, solar eclipses, and supernovae were made in China.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and herbal medicine were also practiced. The [[Four Great Inventions]] of China: the [[compass]], [[gunpowder]], papermaking, and printing were among the most important technological advances, only known in Europe by the end of the Middle Ages.

According to the Scottish researcher [[Joseph Needham]], the Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early [[Seismology|seismological]] detectors, [[matches]], [[paper]], the double-action [[piston pump]], [[cast iron]], the iron [[plough]], the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the [[suspension bridge]], [[natural gas]] as fuel, the [[magnetic compass]], the [[raised-relief map]], the [[propeller]], the [[crossbow]], the [[south-pointing chariot]], and [[gunpowder]]. Other Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period, according to Joseph Needham's research, include: [[block printing]] and [[movable type]], phosphorescent paint, and the [[spinning wheel]].

The solid-fuel [[rocket]] was invented in China about 1150 AD, nearly 200 years after the invention of [[black powder]] (which acted as the rocket's fuel). At the same time that the [[age of exploration]] was occurring in the West, the Chinese emperors of the [[Ming Dynasty]] also sent ships, [[Treasure voyages|some reaching Africa]]. But the enterprises were not further funded, halting further exploration and development. When [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s ships reached [[Brunei]] in 1521, they found a wealthy city that had been fortified by Chinese engineers, and protected by a [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]. [[Antonio Pigafetta]] noted that much of the technology of Brunei was equal to Western technology of the time. Also, there were more cannons in Brunei than on Magellan's ships, and the Chinese merchants to the Brunei court had sold them [[spectacles]] and [[porcelain]], which were rarities in Europe.

===Persia===
{{main|Science and technology in Iran}}

The [[Qanat]], a water management system used for irrigation, originated in [[Iran]] before the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid period]] of Persia&lt;!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, "Persian Empire"; link to a specific iteration of this topic --&gt;. The oldest and largest known qanat is in the Iranian city of [[Gonabad]] which, after 2,700&amp;nbsp;years, still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ward English  | first = Paul  | title = The Origin and Spread of Qanats in the Old World | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume =  112| issue =  3 | pages =170–181 | publisher = [[JSTOR]]
  | date = June 21, 1968 | jstor=986162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 7th&amp;nbsp;century AD, Persians in [[Afghanistan]] developed the first practical [[windmill]]s. For later medieval technologies developed in [[Islamization of Iran|Islamic Persia]], see [[Inventions in medieval Islam]].

=== Greek and Hellenistic ===
[[File:Heron's Windwheel.jpg|thumb|200px|Hero's wind-powered [[Organ (music)|organ]] (reconstruction)]]
{{main|Ancient Greek technology}}

[[Ancient Greek technology]] developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Some inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks are the following: the gear, screw, bronze casting techniques, [[water clock]], [[water organ]](hydraulis), [[torsion siege engine]], and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war.

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] engineers invented many technologies and improved upon pre-existing technologies, particularly during the [[Hellenistic period]]. [[Heron of Alexandria]] invented a basic [[steam engine]] and demonstrated knowledge of mechanic and pneumatic systems. [[Archimedes]] invented several machines. The Greeks were unique in pre-industrial times in their ability to combine scientific research with the development of new technologies. One example is the [[Archimedean screw]]; this technology was first conceptualized in mathematics, then built. Other technologies invented by Greek scientists include the [[ballista]]e, the [[piston pump]], and primitive [[analog computers]] like the [[Antikythera mechanism]]. Greek architects were responsible for the first true [[dome]]s, and were the first to explore the [[Golden ratio]] and its relationship with geometry and architecture.

Apart from [[Hero of Alexandria]]'s steam [[aeolipile]], Hellenistic technicians were the first to invent watermills and windwheels, making them global pioneers in three of the four known means of non-human propulsion prior to the Industrial Revolution (the fourth being sails). However, only water power was used extensively in antiquity.

Other Greek inventions include torsion catapults, pneumatic catapults, crossbows, cranes, rutways, organs, the keyboard mechanism, gears, differential gears, screws, refined parchment, showers, dry docks, diving bells, odometer and astrolabes. In architecture, Greek engineers constructed monumental lighthouses such as the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] and devised the first central heating systems. The [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]] is the earliest tunnel in history which has been excavated with a scientific approach from both ends.

Automata like vending machines, automatic doors and many other ingenious devices were first built by Hellenistic engineers as [[Ctesibius]], [[Philo of Byzantium]] and Heron. Greek technological treatises were scrupuously studied and copied by later Byzantine, Arabic and Latin European scholars and provided much of the foundation for further technological advances in these civilizations.

=== Roman ===
{{main|Roman technology}}
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in France, a Roman aqueduct]]
[[File:Archscrew2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines]]

[[Roman technology]] supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years. The Roman Empire had an advanced set of technology for their time. Some of the Roman technology in Europe may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Roman technological feats in many different areas like: civil engineering, construction materials, transport technology, and some inventions such as the [[mechanical reaper]] went unmatched until the 19th century.
Romans developed an intensive and sophisticated agriculture, expanded upon existing iron working technology, created [[Roman law|laws]] providing for individual ownership, advanced stonemasonry technology, advanced [[Roman road|road-building]] (exceeded only in the 19th century), military engineering, civil engineering, spinning and weaving and several different machines like the [[reaper|Gallic reaper]] that helped to increase productivity in many sectors of the Roman economy. They also developed water power through building aqueducts on a grand scale, using water not just for drinking supplies but also for [[irrigation]], powering [[water mill]]s and in mining. They used drainage wheels extensively in deep underground mines, one device being the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]. They were the first to apply [[hydraulic mining]] methods for prospecting for metal ores, and for extracting those ores from the ground when found using a method known as [[hushing]].

Roman engineers build [[monumental arches]], [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman bridge|true arch bridges]], [[harbour]]s, [[List of Roman dams|dam]]s, vaults and [[List of Roman domes|domes]] on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the [[Codex|book (Codex)]], [[glass blowing]] and [[concrete]]. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the [[concrete]] which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day. Roman society had also carried over the design of a door lock with tumblers and springs from Greece. Like many other aspects of innovation and culture that were carried on from Greece to Rome, the lines between where each one originated from have become skewed over time. These mechanisms were highly sophisticated and intricate for the era.&lt;ref&gt;Naif A. Haddad, "Critical Review, Assessment and Investigation of Ancient Technology Evolution of Door Locking Mechanisms in S.E. Mediterranean," ''Mediterranean Archaeology &amp; Archaeometry'' 16, no. 1: 43-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman civilization was highly urbanized by pre-modern standards. Many cities of the [[Roman Empire]] had over 100,000 inhabitants with the capital Rome being the largest metropolis of antiquity. Features of Roman urban life included multistory apartment buildings called [[Insula (building)|insulae]], street paving, public flush toilets, glass windows and [[Hypocaust|floor and wall heating]]. The Romans understood [[hydraulics]] and constructed [[fountain]]s and waterworks, particularly [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]s, which were the hallmark of their civilization. They exploited water power by building [[water mill]]s, sometimes in series, such as the sequence found at [[Barbegal]] in southern France and suspected on the [[Janiculum]] in Rome. Some [[Thermae|Roman baths]] have lasted to this day. The Romans developed many technologies which were apparently lost in the [[Middle Ages]], and were only fully reinvented in the 19th and 20th centuries. They also left texts describing their achievements, especially [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Frontinus]] and [[Vitruvius]].

Other less known Roman innovations include [[cement]], boat mills, arch [[dam]]s and possibly [[tide mill]]s.

== Mesoamerica &amp; Andean Region ==
Lacking suitable beasts of burden and inhabiting domains often too mountainous or boggy for wheeled transport, the ancient civilizations of the Americas did not develop wheeled transport or the mechanics associated with animal power. Nevertheless, they produced advanced engineering including above ground and underground acqeducts, quake-proof masonry, artificial lakes, dykes, 'fountains,' pressurized water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://live.psu.edu/story/46532 |title=Maya plumbing, first pressurized water feature found in New World |author=A’ndrea Messer |date=February 8, 2011 |website=Penn State News |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208225152/http://live.psu.edu/story/46532 |archive-date=2013-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; road ways and complex terracing. Equally, gold-working commenced early in Peru (2000 BCE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archaeology.about.com/b/2008/03/31/the-first-gold-working-in-peru.htm | archive-date=April 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412174748/http://archaeology.about.com/b/2008/03/31/the-first-gold-working-in-peru.htm |title=A Walking Tour of Machu Picchu, Peru |author=K. Kris Hirst |date= |website= about.com |access-date= August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually copper, tin, lead and bronze were used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Although metallurgy did not spread to Mesoamerica until the Middle Ages, it was employed here and in the Andes for sophisticated alloys and gilding. The Native Americans developed a complex understanding of the chemical properties or utility of natural substances, with the result that a majority of the world's early medicinal drugs and edible crops, many important adhesives, paints, fibres, plasters, and other useful items were the products of these civilizations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Perhaps the best-known Mesoamerican invention was rubber, which was used to create rubber bands, rubber bindings, balls, syringes, 'raincoats,' boots, and waterproof insulation on containers and flasks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5009">'''Aviation engineering''' is the science of designing, developing, and assembling aircraft. Aviation engineers focus on airspace development, airport design, aircraft navigation technologies, and aerodrome planning. Professionals working in this field experiment with innovations in technology and materials, test planes, simulate flight conditions, and more.

As a branch of law, it is art for it involves formulation of [[public policy]], regulations, aviation laws pertaining to [[airspace]], [[airline]]s, [[airport]]s, [[aerodrome]]s and the conduct of [[air services agreements]] through treaty.

This branch of [[engineering]] is distinct to [[aerospace engineering]] which deals with the science of flying craft and spacecraft.

==Airspace development==
The global airspace is divided into territorial airspace which then belongs to a [[country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What is meant by international waters and airspace? {{!}} Find Laws, Legal Information, News &amp; Solicitors - Findlaw UK |url=http://findlaw.co.uk/law/government/other_law_and_government_topics/international_waters_and_international_airspace.html |website=Find Laws, Legal Information, News &amp; Solicitors - Findlaw UK |access-date=2016-02-02 |language=en-US |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301054920/http://findlaw.co.uk/law/government/other_law_and_government_topics/international_waters_and_international_airspace.html |archivedate=2016-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, airspace has to be engineered to benefit both military and civil users. Planning and designing airspace is important so as not to affect military operations and in order to designate air routes for commercial airlines to navigate freely without intervention by military authorities. For instance, not all of [[China]] can be used for commercial aeronautical navigation. Certain airspaces are designated as military-use only. Navigating outside commercial airspaces in the country may lead to risk of the astrayed aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = China To Continue Airspace Relaxation|url = http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-04-13/china-continue-airspace-relaxation|website = Aviation International News|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prior years, airspace has been limited to military and air mail services. The advancement in aerospace engineering brought to fore aircraft designs that lead to the development of commercial airliners. Governments around the world concluded air rights for their respective airlines and their corresponding aircraft. Government saw the economic potential of airspace as a state enterprise. This rise in the development of commercial aviation led to the study of the complexities of aircraft (plane) management, airport design and construction, international air services agreements (treaties).

In recent years, the global airline industry has demanded that China should reform its aviation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = REFILE-China aviation regulator to push for air space reform -paper|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/china-aviation-idUSL4N0XC2TM20150415|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2015-04-15|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airport design==
Recent designs of airports have been engineered to align with global environmental standards. Advancement in [[civil engineering]] and [[architecture]] make an interplay of the two disciplines.

==Career==
Governments around the world hire aviation engineers for all sorts of reasons. In the [[United States]], federal, state and local agencies all commonly employ aviation engineers for agencies such as the Department of Transportation. The Federal Aviation Administration, which is in charge of controlling aircraft navigation throughout the whole nation, maintaining navigation, licensing and certification for aviation engineers. FAA employs many aviation engineers to work on research and development problems, [[noise pollution]] and hypersonic aircraft among other things. 

Engineers are heavily involved in improving aviation technologies to support the advancement of military and commercial aviation. Aviation engineers are often employed in aerospace machine shops specializing in the technological advancement of aircraft parts and equipment. These shops produce aircraft components such as electrical connectors, oxygen generation systems, landing gear assemblies, and other pieces that require special attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aerospace Machine Shop {{!}} Precision CNC machining {{!}} Ardel Engineering|url = http://www.ardelengineering.com/aircraft-aerospace|website = www.ardelengineering.com|access-date = 2016-02-02|first = |last = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aviation engineers do more than work on planes. Aviation engineers also play a large role in airport design. They provide guidance for the construction and daily running of the airports, as well as help in the operation and maintenance.

'''Bicameralism''' (the condition of being divided into "two-chambers") is a radical hypothesis in [[psychology]] that argues that the human [[mind]] once operated in a state in which cognitive functions were divided between one part of the brain which appears to be "speaking", and a second part which listens and obeys — a ''bicameral mind''. The term was coined by [[Julian Jaynes]], who presented the idea in his 1976 book ''The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Bicameral Mind with Joe McCormick |date=2017-11-24 |series=Stuff They Don't Want You to Know |url=https://www.stufftheydontwantyoutoknow.com/podcasts/the-bicameral-mind-with-joe-mccormick.htm |access-date=2017-11-27 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein he made the case that a bicameral mentality was the normal and ubiquitous state of the human mind as recently as 3,000 years ago, near the end of the [[Bronze Age|Mediterranean bronze age]].

==''The Origin of Consciousness''==
Jaynes uses [[Bicameralism|governmental bicameralism]] as a metaphor to describe a mental state in which the experiences and memories of the right hemisphere of the brain are transmitted to the left hemisphere via auditory hallucinations. The metaphor is based on the idea of [[lateralization of brain function]] although each half of a normal human brain is constantly communicating with the other through the ''[[corpus callosum]]''. The metaphor is not meant to imply that the two halves of the bicameral brain were "cut off" from each other but that the bicameral mind was experienced as a different, non-conscious mental schema wherein volition in the face of novel stimuli was mediated through a linguistic control mechanism and experienced as auditory verbal hallucination.

===Bicameral mentality===
Bicameral mentality would be non-conscious in its inability to reason and articulate about mental contents through meta-reflection, reacting without explicitly realizing and without the meta-reflective ability to give an account of ''why'' one did so. The bicameral mind would thus lack metaconsciousness, autobiographical memory, and the capacity for executive "ego functions" such as deliberate mind-wandering and conscious introspection of mental content. When bicamerality as a method of social control was no longer adaptive in complex civilizations, this mental model was replaced by the conscious mode of thought which, Jaynes argued, is grounded in the acquisition of metaphorical [[language]] learned by exposure to narrative practice.
 
According to Jaynes, ancient people in the bicameral state of mind would have experienced the world in a manner that has some similarities to that of a [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]]. Rather than making conscious evaluations in novel or unexpected situations, the person would hallucinate a voice or "god" giving admonitory advice or commands and obey without question: One would not be at all conscious of one's own thought processes ''per se''. Jaynes's hypothesis is offered as a possible explanation of "''command hallucinations''" that often direct the behavior of those labeled schizophrenic, as well as other voice hearers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Erkwoh, R.  | title=Command Hallucinations: Who Obeys and Who Resists When?  | journal=Psychopathology | year= 2002 | volume = 35 |doi=10.1159/000067065 | pages=272–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jaynes’ evidence===
Jaynes built a case for this hypothesis that human brains existed in a bicameral state until as recently as 3,000 years ago by citing evidence from many diverse sources including historical literature. He took an [[interdisciplinary]] approach, drawing data from many different fields.&lt;ref name="EvidenceSummary"&gt;{{cite web | year=1998–2006 | last=Kuijsten | first=Marcel | url=http://www.julianjaynes.org/evidence_summary.php | title=Summary of Evidence | accessdate=2006-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaynes asserted that, until roughly the times written about in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', humans did not generally have the self-awareness characteristic of [[consciousness]] as most people experience it today. Rather, the bicameral individual was guided by mental commands believed to be issued by external "[[Deity|gods]]" — commands which were recorded in ancient [[Mythology|myths]], legends and historical accounts. This is exemplified not only in the commands given to characters in ancient epics but also the very [[muse]]s of [[Greek mythology]] which "sang" the poems. According to Jaynes, the ancients literally heard muses as the direct source of their [[music]] and [[poetry]].

Jaynes asserts that in the ''Iliad'' and sections of the [[Old Testament]] no mention is made of any kind of [[cognition|cognitive]] processes such as [[introspection]], and there is no apparent indication that the writers were self-aware. Jaynes suggests, the older portions of the Old Testament (such as the [[Book of Amos]]) have few or none of the features of some later books of the Old Testament (such as [[Ecclesiastes]]) as well as later works such as Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', which show indications of a profoundly different kind of mentality — an early form of consciousness.&lt;ref name="EvidenceSummary" /&gt;

In ancient times, Jaynes noted, gods were generally much more numerous and much more [[anthropomorphic]] than in modern times, and speculates that this was because each bicameral person had their own "god" who reflected their own desires and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stove | first=D.C. |date=April 1989 | title=The Oracles &amp; Their Cessation | journal=Encounter | volume=72 | issue=4 | pages=30–38 | issn=0013-7073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also noted that in ancient societies the corpses of the dead were often treated as though still alive (being seated, dressed, and even fed) as a form of [[ancestor worship]], and Jaynes argued that the dead bodies were presumed to be still living and the source of auditory hallucinations.&lt;ref name="EvidenceSummary" /&gt; This adaptation to the village communities of 100&amp;nbsp;individuals or more formed the core of religion. Unlike today's hallucinations, the voices of ancient times were structured by cultural norms to produce a seamlessly functioning society.

Jaynes inferred that these "voices" came from the [[right brain]] counterparts of the [[left brain]] language centres; specifically, the counterparts to [[Wernicke's area]] and [[Broca's area]]. These regions are somewhat dormant in the right brains of most modern humans, but Jaynes noted that some studies show that auditory hallucinations correspond to increased activity in these areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="EvidenceSummary" /&gt;

Jaynes notes that even at the time of publication there is no consensus as to the cause or origins of [[schizophrenia]]. Jaynes argues that schizophrenia is a vestige of humanity's earlier bicameral state.&lt;ref name="EvidenceSummary" /&gt; Recent evidence shows that many schizophrenics do not just hear random voices but experience "[[Hallucination#Command|command hallucinations]]" instructing their behavior or urging them to commit certain acts.{{Full citation needed|date=December 2013}}

As support for Jaynes's argument, these command hallucinations are little different from the commands from gods which feature prominently in ancient stories.&lt;ref name="EvidenceSummary" /&gt; Indirect evidence supporting Jaynes's theory that hallucinations once played an important role in human mentality can be found in the recent book ''Muses, Madmen, and Prophets: Rethinking the History, Science, and Meaning of Auditory Hallucination'' by [[Daniel Smith (writer)|Daniel Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Daniel |title=Muses, Madmen, and Prophets: Rethinking the history, science, and meaning of auditory hallucination |year=2007 |isbn=1-59420-110-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakdown of bicameralism===
Jaynes theorized that a shift from bicameralism marked the beginning of introspection and consciousness as we know it today. According to Jaynes, this bicameral mentality began malfunctioning or "breaking down" during the 2nd&amp;nbsp;millennium&amp;nbsp;BCE. He speculates that primitive ancient societies tended to collapse periodically: for example, Egypt's [[History of ancient Egypt|Intermediate Periods]], as well as the periodically vanishing cities of the Mayas, as changes in the environment strained the socio-cultural equilibria sustained by this bicameral mindset.

The [[Bronze age collapse]] of the 2nd&amp;nbsp;millennium&amp;nbsp;BCE led to mass migrations and created a rash of unexpected situations and stresses which required ancient minds to become more flexible and creative. Self-awareness, or consciousness, was the culturally evolved solution to this problem. This necessity of communicating commonly observed phenomena among individuals who shared no common language or cultural upbringing encouraged those communities to become self-aware to survive in a new environment. Thus consciousness, like bicamerality, emerged as a neurological adaptation to social complexity in a changing world.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Jaynes further argues that [[divination]], [[prayer]], and [[oracle]]s arose during this breakdown period, in an attempt to summon instructions from the "gods" whose voices could no longer be heard.&lt;ref name="EvidenceSummary" /&gt; The consultation of special bicamerally operative individuals, or of divination by [[Cleromancy|casting lots]] and so forth, was a response to this loss, a transitional era depicted, for example, in the book of [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]]. It was also evidenced in children who could communicate with the gods, but as their neurology was set by language and society they gradually lost that ability. Those who continued prophesying, being bicameral according to Jaynes, could be killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaynes |first=Julian | authorlink=Julian Jaynes | title=The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind | publisher=Houghton Mifflin |orig-year=1976| year=2000 |isbn=0-618-05707-2 |page=221 |url=http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/Julian_Jaynes_The_Origin_of_Consciousness.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah%2013:3-4;&amp;version=31; |title=Zechariah |at=13:&amp;nbsp;2-3 |website=biblegateway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leftovers of the bicameral mind today, according to Jaynes, include religion, [[hypnosis]], possession, schizophrenia, and the general sense of need for external authority in decision-making.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Reception==
===Popular reception===
An early (1977) reviewer considered Jaynes's hypothesis worthy and offered conditional support, arguing the notion deserves further study.&lt;ref name=Keen_1977&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Keen, Sam |title=Julian Jaynes: Portrait of the Psychologist as a Maverick Theorizer |magazine=[[Psychology Today]] |date=November 1977 |volume=11 |pages=66-67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Keen, Sam |title=The Lost Voices of the Gods (Interview with Julian Jaynes) |magazine=Psychology Today |date=November 1977 |volume=11 |pages=58-60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Origin of Consciousness'' was financially successful, and has been reprinted several times.

Originally published in 1976&lt;ref name=Jaynes_1976&gt;,{{cite book |last=Jaynes |first=Julian |authorlink=Julian Jaynes |title=The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind |year=1976 |ISBN=0-395-20729-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was nominated for the [[National Book Award]] in 1978. It has been translated into Italian, Spanish, German, French, and Persian.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} A new edition, with an afterword that addressed some criticisms and restated the main themes, was published in the US in 1990 and in the UK (by Penguin Books) in 1993,&lt;ref name=Jaynes_1993&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaynes |first=Julian |authorlink=Julian Jaynes |title=The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |orig-year=1993 |year=2000 |isbn=0-14-017491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; re-issued in 2000.&lt;ref name=Jaynes_2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaynes |first=Julian |authorlink=Julian Jaynes |title=The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |orig-year=1976 |year=2000 |isbn=0-618-05707-2 |url=http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/Julian_Jaynes_The_Origin_of_Consciousness.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip K. Dick]], [[Terrence McKenna]], and [[David Bowie]] all cited the book as an influence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophyforlife.org/voice-hearing-and-the-bicameral-mind/ |title=Voice-hearing and the bicameral mind |website=Philosophy for Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarly reactions===
Jaynes's hypothesis remains controversial. The primary scientific criticism has been that the conclusions drawn by Jaynes had no basis in neuropsychiatric fact.&lt;ref name=Moffic1987/&gt;

According to Jaynes, language is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for consciousness: Language existed thousands of years earlier, but consciousness could not have emerged without language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaynes |first=Julian |authorlink=Julian Jaynes |title=The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |orig-year=1976 |year=2000 |page=66 |isbn=0-618-05707-2 |url=http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/Julian_Jaynes_The_Origin_of_Consciousness.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that language is a necessary component of subjective consciousness and more abstract forms of thinking has gained the support of proponents including [[Andy Clark]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[William H. Calvin]], [[Merlin Donald]], John Limber, [[Howard Margolis]], [[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]], and José Luis Bermúdez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuijsten |first=Marcel |title=Reflections on the Dawn of Consciousness: Julian Jaynes's bicameral mind theory revisited |publisher=Julian Jaynes Society |year=2007 |isbn=0-9790744-0-1 |pages=96–100, 169–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Gary |year=2010 |title=What is it like to be nonconscious?

The author's (1987) published response was: ''...&amp;nbsp;Jaynes’ hypothesis makes for interesting reading and stimulates much thought in the receptive reader.

[[Brian J. McVeigh]], a graduate student of Jaynes, maintains that many of the most frequent criticisms of Jaynes' theory are either incorrect or reflect serious misunderstandings of Jaynes' theory, especially Jaynes' more precise definition of consciousness. Jaynes defines consciousness — in the tradition of [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Descartes]] — as "''that which is introspectable''". Jaynes draws a sharp distinction between consciousness ("''introspectable mind-space''") and other mental processes such as cognition, learning, sensation, and perception. McVeigh argues that this distinction is frequently not recognized by those offering critiques of Jaynes' theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McVeigh |first=Brian |year=2007 |title=Elephants in the Psychology Department: Overcoming intellectual barriers to understanding Julian Jaynes's theory |journal=Julian Jaynes Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual scholars' comments===
[[Richard Dawkins]] in ''The God Delusion'' (2006) wrote of ''The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind'':&lt;blockquote&gt;It is one of those books that is either complete rubbish or a work of consummate genius; Nothing in between! Probably the former, but I'm hedging my bets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Dawkins |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2006 |isbn=1-4303-1230-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosopher Daniel Dennett suggested that Jaynes may have been wrong about some of his supporting arguments – especially the importance he attached to hallucinations – but that these things are not essential to his main thesis:&lt;ref name="Dennett 1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dennett |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |year=1986 |title=Julian Jaynes's software archeology |journal=Canadian Psychology |volume=27 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we are going to use this top-down approach, we are going to have to be bold. We are going to have to be speculative, but there is good and bad speculation, and this is not an unparalleled activity in science. ... Those scientists who have no taste for this sort of speculative enterprise will just have to stay in the trenches and do without it, while the rest of us risk embarrassing mistakes and have a lot of fun. — [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dennett |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |year=1998 |contribution=Julian Jaynes's software archeology |title=Brainchildren: Essays on Designing Minds}}{{page number|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Gregory Cochran]], a physicist and adjunct professor of anthropology at the University of Utah, wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Genes affecting personality, reproductive strategies, cognition, are all able to change significantly over few-millennia time scales if the environment favors such change — and this includes the new environments we have made for ourselves, things like new ways of making a living and new social structures. ... There is evidence that such change has occurred. ... On first reading, ''Breakdown'' seemed one of the craziest books ever written, but Jaynes may have been on to something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Edge Foundation |year=2006 |title=What is your dangerous idea? |url=http://www.edge.org/q2006/q06_4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author and historian of science [[Morris Berman]] writes: "''[Jaynes's] description of this new consciousness is one of the best I have come across.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berman |first=Morris |title=Wandering God: A study in nomadic spirituality |year=2000 |isbn=0-7914-4442-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danish science writer [[Tor Nørretranders]] discusses Jaynes's theory favorably in his 1991 book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nørretranders |first=Tor |title=User Illusion: Cutting consciousness down to size |year=1991 |isbn=0-7139-9182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=June 2018}}

Iain McGilchrist who [[The Master and His Emissary|published a similar idea]], accepts Jayne's intention, but proposes that Jayne's hypothesis was the opposite of what happened:{{anchor|McGilchrist_quote}}&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe he [Jayne] got one important aspect of the story back to front. His contention that the phenomena he describes came about because of a ''breakdown'' of the 'bicameral mind' – so that the two hemispheres, previously separate, now merged – is the precise inverse of what happened.{{r|McGilchrist_2009|p=262}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Issues with Jaynes' proposal==

===Epic of Gilgamesh as a counter-example===
As an argument against Jaynes' proposed date of the transition from bicameralism to consciousness some critics have referred to the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Early copies of the epic are many centuries older&lt;ref name=Dalley_Gilgamesh&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Dalley |editor-first=Stephanie |editorlink=Stephanie Dalley |title=Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, the Flood, Gilgamesh, and Others |pages=41–42, 45 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-953836-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; than even the oldest passages of the Old Testament,&lt;ref name=Mitchell_1988&gt;{{cite book |first=T.C. |last=Mitchell |title=The Bible in the British Museum |publisher=The British Museum Press|date=1988 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet it describes introspection and other mental processes that, according to Jaynes, were impossible for the bicameral mind.

Jaynes noted that the most complete version of the [[Gilgamesh epic]] dates to post-bicameral times (7th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BCE), dismisses these instances of introspection as the result of rewriting and expansion by later conscious scribes, and points to differences between the more recent version of ''Gilgamesh'' and surviving fragments of earlier versions: "''The most interesting comparison is in Tablet&amp;nbsp;X.''"{{r|Jaynes_2000|p=252}} His answer, however, does not deal with the generally accepted dating of the "Standard Version" of the Gilgamesh epic to the later 2nd&amp;nbsp;millennium&amp;nbsp;BCE, nor does it account for the introspection that so often taken as characteristic of the "Standard Version" being thoroughly rooted in the Old Babylonian and Sumerian versions, especially so as our understanding of the Old Babylonian poem improves.&lt;ref name=Dalley_Gilgamesh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitchell_1988/&gt;&lt;ref name=George_2003&gt;For a through overview of the current understanding of the Gilgamesh Epic's textual history, see:&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |last=George |first=A. R. |author-link=Andrew R. George |date=2003 |title=The Babylonian Gilgamesh Epic: Introduction, critical edition, and cuneiform texts |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-927841-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=21xxZ_gUy_wC&amp;pg=PA70 |access-date=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occident-centrism===
Julian Jaynes' study is mostly based on the writings and culture of the Mediterranean and Near-Eastern regions, although he occasionally also refers to ancient writings of India and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaynes |first=Julian |authorlink=Julian Jaynes |title=The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |orig-year=1976 |year=2000 |pages=312–313 |isbn=0-618-05707-2 |url = http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/Julian_Jaynes_The_Origin_of_Consciousness.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;According to Jaynes, [[India]]n [[Vedic]] literature dates clearly from the bicameral age whereas [[Upanishads]] very clearly show a developed subjectively conscious mind, as do [[Confucius]]'s teachings in China.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simultaneous, world-wide transition===
Jaynes' proposal does not explain how such bicameralism could also have been near totally lost at the same time across the whole planet and in the entire human species. In particular the [[Indigenous peoples|aborigine]] culture was completely separated from the rest of the world from 4000&amp;nbsp;BCE–1600&amp;nbsp;CE and appears today to be historically unchanged, but also self-conscious.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Pre-transition divination===
Divination is also considerably older than that date and the early writings he claims show bicamerality: The oldest recorded [[Chinese Writing]] was on [[oracle bones]], meaning that divination arose at the same time or even earlier than writing in Chinese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/china-oldest-writing_n_3574624.html |title=Oldest Chinese writing}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed_verification|date=October 2015}}

===Recent cultural ancestor-worship===
While he said ancient societies engaged in ancestor worship before this date, non-ancient societies also engaged in it after that date; very advanced societies like the [[Aztecs]] and [[Egyptians]] mummified and deified rulers (see [[Pyramids]] and the philosopher [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]]). The Aztecs and [[Inca]]ns did so all the way up to their conquest by the Spanish.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Sense of agency dependent on lateralization===
It is now known{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} that the [[sense of agency]] is closely connected with lateralization: The left parietal lobe is active when visualizing actions by the self, while the right parietal lobe is active for actions by others. Additionally, [[Wernicke's area]] processes the literal meaning of language, while the homologous region in the right hemisphere processes the intent of a speaker.

It has been found{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} that people with damage to the right inferior parietal cortex experience [[alien hand syndrome]], as do people who have had a [[corpus callosotomy]]. This reverses the relationship between the right and left hemispheres posited by Jaynes' proposed bicameralism: It is the left hemisphere that is responsible for speech and the right hemisphere that is responsible for self-awareness.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Similar ideas==
[[VS Ramachandran]], in his 2003 book ''The Emerging Mind'', proposes a similar concept, referring to the left cortical hemisphere as an "''apologist''", and the right cortical hemisphere as a "''revolutionary''".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In his book ''Neuroreality: A Scientifice Religion to Restore Meaning,or How 7 Brain Elements Create 7 Minds and 7 Realities'', Bruce E. Morton, formerly the [[University of Hawaii]], similarly proposed such a concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Psychiatrist [[Iain McGilchrist]] reviews scientific research into the role of the brain's hemispheres, and cultural evidence, in his book ''[[The Master and His Emissary]]''.&lt;ref name=McGilchrist_2009&gt;{{cite book |author=McGilchrist, Iain |title=The Master and his Emissary |year=2009 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |isbn=0-300-14878-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Jaynes, McGilchrist proposes that since the time of Plato the left hemisphere of the brain (the "emissary" in the title) has increasingly taken over from the right hemisphere (the "master"), to our ''detriment''. McGilchrist, while accepting Jayne's intention, felt that Jayne's hypothesis was "''the precise inverse of what happened''" and that rather than a shift ''from'' bicameralism there evolved a separation of the hemispheres ''to'' bicameralism.&lt;ref name=McGilchrist_2009/&gt;(See [[#McGilchrist_quote|McGilchrist quotation, above]].)

[[Michael Gazzaniga]] pioneered the [[split-brain]] experiments which led him to propose a similar theory called the [[left brain interpreter]].

Neuroscientist [[Michael Persinger]], who co-invented the “[[God helmet]]” in the 1980s, believes that his invention may induce mystical experiences by having the separate right hemisphere consciousness intrude into the awareness of the normally-dominant left hemisphere.&lt;ref name=PMID_8321608&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Persinger |first1=M.A. |title=Vectorial cerebral hemisphericity as differential sources for the sensed presence, mystical experiences and religious conversions |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |pmid=8321608 |pages=915–30 |issue=3 Part&amp;nbsp;1 |volume=76 |year=1993 |doi=10.2466/pms.1993.76.3.915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
{{unsourced section|date=May 2018}}
* In literature, the 1992 novel ''[[Snow Crash]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]] involves an attempt to return humans to their bicameral, pre-conscious state. It contains some of the illustrations used in Jaynes' book. Stephenson's first novel, ''[[The Big U]]'', also contains references to bicameralism as an explanation for cult-like behavior among some of the titular university's students and teachers.
*The 2005 novel ''[[Human Traces]]'' by [[Sebastian Faulks]] also contains themes of bicameralism.
*[[Terence Hawkins]]' 2009 novel, ''The Rage of Achilles'', is based on Jaynes' notion that present-day consciousness arose during the time depicted in the Iliad.  He describes a time of painful transition, in which some characters are fully in thrall to command hallucinations, a few are truly modern, and most in-between.

The Julian Jaynes Society was founded by supporters of bicameralism in 1997, shortly after Jaynes' death. The society published a collection of essays on bicameralism in 2007, with contributors including psychological anthropologist [[Brian J. McVeigh]], psychologists John Limber and Scott Greer, clinical psychologist John Hamilton, philosophers Jan Sleutels and [[David Stove]], and sinologist Michael Carr (see [[Shi (personator)|''shi'' “personator”]]). The book also contains an extensive biography of Julian Jaynes by historian of psychology William Woodward and June Tower, and a foreword by neuroscientist [[Michael Persinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuijsten |first=Marcel |title=Reflections on the Dawn of Consciousness: Julian Jaynes's bicameral mind theory revisited |publisher=Julian Jaynes Society |year=2007 |isbn=0-9790744-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blodgett Iceberg Tongue''' ({{Coord|66|5|S|130|0|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a large [[iceberg tongue]] that extends seaward from the vicinity of [[Cape Morse]] and [[Cape Carr]] on the east side of [[Porpoise Bay, Antarctica|Porpoise Bay]]. It was named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] for [[Gardner D. Blodgett]], Office of Geography, Department of Interior, who, in 1955, prepared a sketch map of the coastal features of Antarctica between 84°E and 144°E from [[U.S. Navy Operation Highjump]] (1946–47) aerial photographs. Since the iceberg tongue was partially delineated for the first time on the 1955 sketch map by Blodgett, use of his name for it is considered appropriate.

[[File:GIS Still Frame.jpg|thumb|Detail of the "Bombay Before the British" interactive [[GIS]] map, showing the Greater Mumbai area (BBB, 2007)]] '''Bombay Before the British''' ('''BBB''') was a three-year research project in the fields of [[History of Architecture]] and History of [[Urbanism]], funded by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education]] through its Science and Technology Foundation (FCT).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fct.mctes.pt/projectos/pub/2002/eng/index.asp?dados=true&amp;ficha=true&amp;pID=47225&amp;areaID=41 Bombay Before the British]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funding for the project began in September 2004 and ended in December 2007, when a final report was submitted containing the project's main conclusions. This report received the highest mark by FCT's evaluating panel. Both senior investigators of the "BBB", Dr. Walter Rossa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ces.uc.pt/investigadores/cv/walter_rossa.pdf Walter Rossa CV]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. Paulo Varela Gomes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ces.uc.pt/myces/UserFiles/curriculos/investigador_110_cv_en_20090722_1437.pdf Paulo Varela Gomes CV]&lt;/ref&gt; were and are professors at the Architecture Department, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, [[University of Coimbra]] ([[Portugal]]).

The project's main object of study was the territory of Greater [[Mumbai]] and its surrounding hinterland during the time of Portuguese colonial rule (1534–1739); during that period, the territory was known as the Baçaim ([[Vasai]]) District of the Northern Province of [[Portuguese India]].

==Background==
In 1997, Dr. Walter Rossa's book "Indo-portuguese Cities" was published by the Portuguese Discoveries Celebrations Committee (CNCDP&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ces.uc.pt/myces/UserFiles/livros/704_Vol.%207%20Cidades%20Indo-Portuguesas.pdf Indo-portuguese Cities]&lt;/ref&gt;). The following year, Dr. Rossa coordinated the topographical survey of the ruins of the Baçaim ([[Vasai]]). During this period (1996–1998), Dr. Paulo Varela Gomes was the delegate of the Oriente Foundation's branch in India ([[Goa]]). In 2000, both of them travelled to the area of Greater [[Mumbai]], together with the second-year students of the Department of Architecture, [[University of Coimbra]], visiting many of the historical sites pertaining to the territory's Indo-Portuguese layer. The research possibilities developed during this trip and the recent scholarly activity of both Rossa and Gomes led up to the proposal for a three-year scientific research project - the "BBB"

==Overview of the project==
The Portuguese presence in the Baçaim ([[Vasai]]) District of the Northern Province between 1534 and 1739 - which included the present day region of [[Greater Mumbai]] -  has left considerable traces on the present-day territory. These include not only ruins of [[military]] and [[religious]] structures but also structures founded by the Portuguese and later modified or rebuilt by other administrations or communities. Most of the Churches that cater to the [[Catholic]] population of [[Greater Mumbai]] today - the [[East Indians]] - were founded by Portuguese [[missionaries]]. Significant information exists within sixteenth and seventeenth century [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sources to prove that [[Catholic]] Communities were inexistent in the Northern Province area at the time of Portuguese occupation in 1534 (although it is very probable that some [[Christian]] communities developed in the area during the 7th and 8th centuries A.D., having become defunct by the time of the Portuguese arrival). 
Beside the network of [[forts]] and [[church (building)|churches]], the Portuguese Northern Province also presented a network of villages that developed under [[Colonialism|colonial]] rule. Most of these villages were leased to Portuguese or [[Indo-Portuguese]] landed [[gentry]]. Especially in [[Salsette Island]], this network of villages was still in place during the first decades of the 20th century and would later become the most important territorial matrix for the development of Suburban [[Mumbai]]. Indeed, the two main railway lines built during the 19th century in [[Salsette]] followed closely a pre-existing road pattern (from [[Kurla]] to [[Thane]] and from [[Bandra]] to [[Bhyandar]]) that crossed many East-Indian villages, with their distinct landscape, architecture and churches. It was only during the 1960s and 1970s that [[Mumbai]]'s exponential growth submerged and, in many cases, erased this network of villages. A few survive along the northwestern coast of [[Salsette Island]], with their unique [[East India]]n communities and traditions.

==Main  tasks==
The BBB's methodology included two main tasks: data gathering; and its interpretation through appropriate tools, namely [[GIS]] software.
Data gathered during the project's timeline included various documents from libraries and archives in [[Portugal]], [[India]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and also material gathered first-hand directly at the sites, through the project's field missions. This data was then stored in a [[Database]] and connected to a [[GIS]] [[interactive]] map. The [[GIS]] map used satellite imagery acquired through the [[European Space Agency]]. Over the layer of satellite imagery was added a number of layers of [[Geographic information system|vectorial]] information, using the symbology of present-day [[cartography]]. The [[GIS]] map's interface allowed for each symbol to be connected to a number of documents stored in the [[Database]]. This methodology allowed the team to confirm the matricial importance on the East-Indian village network upon the [[suburban]] growth of Greater [[Mumbai]] all along the 20th century, among other things

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2295">'''Conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy''' ('''CEMS''') is a [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]] technique based on [[conversion electron]].

The CEM spectrum can be obtained either by collecting essentially all the electrons leaving the surface (integral technique), or by selecting the ones in a given energy range by means of a [[beta ray]] [[spectrometer]] (differential or depth selective CEMS).

This method allows the use of simple and inexpensive detecting equipment, mainly flow-type proportional detectors in which large counting rates can be obtained. This last characteristic makes possible the study of samples with the natural abundance of the Mössbauer [[isotope]]. The information furnished by the integral measurements can be increased by using various angles of incidence or by depositing thin layers of inert material on the sample.

==Theory==
In the energy range used in CEMS, the incident radiation can interact with the absorber through two kinds of processes: (a) conventional interactions – [[photoelectric effect|photoelectric]] and [[Compton effect|Compton]] effects, and (b) nuclear resonant absorption – [[Mössbauer effect]]. Due to conventional interactions the beam is attenuated and electrons are emitted from the sample. The nuclear de-excitation following the resonant absorption takes place by emission of either a [[gamma ray]] or an internal conversion (IC) electron. In the latter case, the atom is left in an ‘excited’ state with a hole in an inner shell; the energy excess is given away with emission of [[Auger effect|Auger electrons]] and/or X-rays. Thus, the electrons emitted from the sample as a consequence of the Mössbauer absorptions are: (a) primary (IC or Auger) electrons originated in the de-excitations of the nuclei excited by the incident beam, and (b) secondary electrons originated by conventional interactions of photons (or resonant absorption of gamma rays) emitted after resonant absorptions.

The '''PDSA Dickin Medal''' was instituted in 1943 in the United Kingdom by [[Maria Dickin]] to honour the work of animals in World War II. It is a bronze [[medallion]], bearing the words "For Gallantry" and "We Also Serve" within a [[laurel wreath]], carried on a ribbon of striped green, dark brown, and pale blue.&lt;ref name="pdsa"/&gt; It is awarded to animals that have displayed "conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving or associated with any branch of the Armed Forces or Civil Defence Units".&lt;ref name=pdsa/&gt; The award is commonly referred to as "the animals' [[Victoria Cross]]" (although the Victoria Cross Trust has opposed this association).&lt;ref name="pdsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/pdsa-dickin-medal |title=PDSA Dickin Medal |publisher=PDSA |accessdate=1 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924092934/http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/pdsa-dickin-medal |archivedate=24 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=modtreo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/HistoryAndHonour/MilitarySearchDogToReceiveAnimalsVictoriaCross.htm |publisher=Ministry of Defence |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=3 March 2010 |title=Military search dog to receive animals' Victoria Cross |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315194420/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/HistoryAndHonour/MilitarySearchDogToReceiveAnimalsVictoriaCross.htm |archivedate=15 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/animals_vc.shtml |publisher = BBC Radio 4 | title = The Animals' VC | accessdate=3 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/VCTrust/status/507583591925051392 |title=There is NO such thing as an Animal VC. |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=4 September 2014 |website=Twitter |publisher=Victoria Cross Trust |accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Dickin was the founder of the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]] (PDSA), a British [[veterinary]] charity.  She established the award for any animal displaying conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst serving with [[British Empire]] armed forces or civil emergency services.  The medal was awarded 54 times between 1943 and 1949 – to 32 [[pigeons]], 18 [[dogs]], 3 [[horses]], and a [[Simon (cat)|ship's cat]] – to acknowledge actions of gallantry or devotion during the [[Second World War]] and subsequent conflicts.  The awarding of the medal was revived in 2000 to honour [[Gander (dog)|Gander]], a [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland dog]], who saved infantrymen during the [[Battle of Hong Kong|Battle of Lye Mun]]. In early 2002, the medal was given in honour of three dogs for their role responding to the [[September 11 attacks]]; it was also awarded to two dogs serving with Commonwealth forces in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Iraq]]. In December 2007, 12 former recipients buried at the [[Ilford Animal Cemetery|PDSA Animal Cemetery]] in [[Ilford]], Essex, were afforded full military honours at the conclusion of a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]-aided project to restore the cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =A better resting place for the animal VCs|author=Clout, Laura |work=The Daily Telegraph| date=14 December 2007|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/media-pr-centre/news/celebrity-to-open-animal-garden-of-remembrance | title = Celebrity to open animal Garden of Remembrance | accessdate = 2 March 2010 | publisher = PDSA | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718174301/http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/media-pr-centre/news/celebrity-to-open-animal-garden-of-remembrance | archivedate = 18 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recipients of the award, in December 1943, were three pigeons, serving with the [[Royal Air Force]], all of whom contributed to the recovery of air crew from ditched aircraft during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=pdsa /&gt; The most recent animal to be cited for the honour is [[Kuga (dog)|Kuga]], a [[Belgian Malinois]] who served with the [[Special Air Service Regiment]] in [[Afghanistan]] in 2012.&lt;ref name= Kuga&gt;{{cite web|title= PDSA Dickin Medal Citation: Kuga, Special Operations Military Working Dog |url= https://www.army.gov.au/media-room/media-releases/dickin-medal-citation-kuga|publisher=Austrlian Army|accessdate=26 October 2018|date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2018, the Dickin Medal has been awarded 70 times, plus one honorary award made in 2014 to all the animals that served in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=PDSA Dickin Medal|work=PDSA|date=17 November 2017|accessdate=17 November 2017|url=https://www.pdsa.org.uk/what-we-do/animal-awards-programme/pdsa-dickin-medal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3364">In [[statistics]] and [[machine learning]], '''discretization''' refers to the process of converting or partitioning continuous [[Variable (statistics)#Applied statistics|attributes]], [[Features (pattern recognition)|features]] or [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]] to discretized or [[nominal data|nominal]] attributes/features/variables/[[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]]. This can be useful when creating probability mass functions – formally, in [[density estimation]]. It is a form of [[discretization]] in general and also of [[data binning|binning]], as in making a [[histogram]]. Whenever [[continuous function|continuous]] data is discretized, there is always some amount of [[discretization error]]. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered [[wikt:negligible|negligible]] for the [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes at hand.

Typically data is discretized into partitions of ''K'' equal lengths/width (equal intervals) or K% of the total data (equal frequencies).&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Dunathan stereoelectronic hypothesis''' is a concept in [[chemistry]] to explain the stereospecefic cleavage of bonds using [[pyridoxal phosphate]]. This occurs because [[stereoelectronic]] effects controls the actions of the [[enzyme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silverman|first1=Richard B.|title=The organic chemistry of enzyme-catalyzed reactions|date=2002|publisher=Acad. Press|location=San Diego, Calif. [u.a.]|isbn=9780126437317|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the correlation between fold type and reaction correlation of [[proteins]] were understood, Harmon C. Dunathan, a [[chemist]] at [[Haverford College]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haverford.edu/chem/mackay/ColinWeb/MacKay_Web.html&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that the bond that is cleaved using [[pyridoxal]] is perpendicular to the system.&lt;ref&gt;http://chemgroups.ucdavis.edu/~toney/Stereoelectronic.html&lt;/ref&gt; Though an important concept in [[bioorganic chemistry]], it is now known that enzyme conformations play a critical role in the final chemical reaction.

==Mode of action==
The [[transition state]] is stabilized by the extended [[pi bond]] network (formation of [[anion]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://chem.uaf.edu/keller/Courses/654Fa11/PDF/654-10-6-11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore [[hyperconjugation]] caused by the extended network draws electrons from the bond to be cleaved, thus weakening the [[chemical bond]] and making it [[labile]]&lt;ref&gt;http://chemgroups.ucdavis.edu/~toney/Publications/BBA%20-%20Proteins%20and%20Proteomics%202011%20Toney.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sigma bond]] that is parallel to the [[pi bond]] network will break.&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/gelb/Chp9.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; The bond that has the highest chance of being cleaved is one with the largest [[HOMO-LUMO]] overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=editors|first1=Mohammed Shahid ... [et al.],|title=Biomedical aspects of histamine current perspectives|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789048193493}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect might be effected by [[electrostatic]] effects within the enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/organic/studsemin/steinkruger/steinkruger-sem.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
This was seen in [[transferase]] and future interests lie in [[decarboxylation]] in various [[catalytic cycles]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.life.illinois.edu/biochem/455/Lab%20exercises/5GOT/PLP%20enzyme%20review.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPRESSO is the successor of a line of echelle spectrometers that include CORAVEL, Elodie, Coralie, and [[High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher|HARPS]]. It measures changes in the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|light spectrum]] with great sensitivity, and will be used to search for Earth-size [[Terrestrial planet|rocky]] [[exoplanet]]s via the [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Radial velocity|radial velocity method]]. For example, Earth induces a radial-velocity variation of 9&amp;nbsp;cm/[[Second|s]] on the Sun; this gravitational "wobble" causes minute variations in the color of sunlight, invisible to the human eye but detectable by the instrument.&lt;ref name="ESPRESSO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espresso.astro.up.pt/ |title=ESPRESSO - Searching for other Worlds |date=2010-10-16 |publisher=Centro de Astrofísica da Universidade do Porto |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telescope light is fed to the instrument, located in the VLT Combined-Coude Laboratory 70 meters away from the telescope, where the light from up to 4 Unit Telescopes of the VLT can be combined. The Principal Investigator is Francesco Pepe.

ESPRESSO will build on the foundations laid by the [[High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher]] (HARPS) instrument at the 3.6-metre telescope at ESO’s [[La Silla Observatory]]. ESPRESSO will benefit not only from the much larger combined light-collecting capacity of the four 8.2-metre VLT Unit Telescopes, but also from improvements in the stability and calibration accuracy that are now possible by [[Frequency comb|laser frequency comb technology]]. The requirement is to reach 10&amp;nbsp;cm/s,&lt;ref name="EspressoNachr" /&gt; but the aimed goal is to obtain a precision level of a few cm/s. This would mean a large step forward over current radial-velocity spectrographs like ESO's [[HARPS]]. The HARPS instrument can attain a precision of 97&amp;nbsp;cm/s (3.5&amp;nbsp;km/h),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/science/10/19/space.new.planets/index.html | work=CNN | title=32 planets discovered outside solar system | accessdate=4 May 2010 | date=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an effective precision of the order of 30&amp;nbsp;cm/s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espresso.astro.up.pt/ |title=ESPRESSO – Searching for other Worlds |date=16 December 2009 |publisher=Centro de Astrofísica da Universidade do Porto |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of only two spectrographs worldwide with such accuracy.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The ESPRESSO would greatly exceed this capability making detection of Earth-size planets from ground-based instruments possible. Commissioning of ESPRESSO at the VLT started late 2017.

The instrument is capable of operating in 1-UT mode (using one of the telescopes) and in 4-UT mode. In 4-UT mode, in which all the four 8-m telescopes are connected incoherently to form a 16-m equivalent telescope, the spectrograph will detect extremely faint objects.&lt;ref name="ESPRESSO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPRESSO2"&gt;{{cite conference |date=July 2010 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |bibcode=2010SPIE.7735E..0FP |doi=10.1117/12.857122 |title=ESPRESSO: the Echelle spectrograph for rocky exoplanets and stable spectroscopic observations |book-title=Ground-based and Airborne Instrumentation for Astronomy III |volume=7735 |page=77350F |last1=Pepe |first1=Francesco A |last2=Cristiani |first2=Stefano |last3=Rebolo Lopez |first3=Rafael |last4=Santos |first4=Nuno C |last5=Amorim |first5=Antonio |last6=Avila |first6=Gerardo |last7=Benz |first7=Willy |last8=Bonifacio |first8=Piercarlo |last9=Cabral |first9=Alexandre |last10=Carvas |first10=Pedro |last11=Cirami |first11=Roberto |last12=Coelho |first12=João |last13=Comari |first13=Maurizio |last14=Coretti |first14=Igor |last15=De Caprio |first15=Vincenzo |last16=Dekker |first16=Hans |last17=Delabre |first17=Bernard |last18=Di Marcantonio |first18=Paolo |last19=d'Odorico |first19=Valentina |last20=Fleury |first20=Michel |last21=García |first21=Ramón |last22=Herreros Linares |first22=José Miguel |last23=Hughes |first23=Ian |last24=Iwert |first24=Olaf |last25=Lima |first25=Jorge |last26=Lizon |first26=Jean-Louis |last27=Lo Curto |first27=Gaspare |last28=Lovis |first28=Christophe |last29=Manescau |first29=Antonio |last30=Martins |first30=Carlos |display-authors=4 |url=http://www.eso.org/sci/libraries/SPIE2010/7735-14.pdf |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, for [[G2V]] type stars:
* Rocky planets around stars as faint as V ~ 9 in (in 1-UT mode)
* Neptune mass planets around stars as faint as V ~ 12 (in 4-UT mode )
* Earth-size rocky planets around stars as faint as V ~ 9 ([[CODEX]] on the [[E-ELT]]) (2025)&lt;ref name="RV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://202.127.29.4/bdep_meeting/download/talks/20July/10-LPasquini.ppt |title=ESPRESSO and CODEX the next generation of RV planet hunters at ESO |date=2010-10-16 |publisher=[[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704072701/http://202.127.29.4/bdep_meeting/download/talks/20July/10-LPasquini.ppt |archivedate=July 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESPRESSO will focus the observations on the best-suited candidates: non-active, non-rotating, quiet [[G-type main-sequence star|G dwarf]]s to [[red dwarf]]s. It will operate at the peak of its efficiency for a spectral type up to [[Stellar classification#Class M|M4-type stars]].

ESPRESSO will use as calibration a laser [[frequency comb]] (LFC), with backup of two [[Thorium|Th]][[Argon|Ar]] lamps. It will have three instrumental modes: singleHR, singleUHR and multiMR. In the singleHR mode ESPRESSO can be fed by any of the four UTs.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5918 ESPRESSO: The next European exoplanet hunter&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eastern Agricultural Complex''' was one of about 10 independent centers of plant domestication in the pre-historic world. By about 1,800 BCE the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of [[North America]] were cultivating for food several species of plants, thus transitioning from a hunter-gatherer economy to agriculture. After 200 BCE when [[maize]] from Mexico was introduced to what is now the eastern United States, the Native Americans of the present-day United States and Canada slowly changed from growing indigenous plants to a maize-based agricultural economy. The cultivation of indigenous plants declined and was eventually abandoned, the formerly domesticated plants reverting to their wild forms.&lt;ref name="SmithYarnell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith| first1 = Bruce D.| last2 = Yarnell| first2 = Richard A.| year = 2009 | title =Initial formation of an indigenous crop complex in eastern North America| journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | volume = 106| issue = 16| pages = 6561–6566|publisher=National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | jstor = 40482136 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0901846106| pmc = 2666091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial four plants known to have been domesticated were goosefoot (''[[Chenopodium berlandieri]]''), sunflower (''[[Helianthus annuus]] var. macrocarpus''), marshelder (''[[Iva annua]] var. macrocarpa''), and squash (''[[Cucurbita pepo]] ssp. ovifera''). Several other species of plants were later domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Yarnell, p. 6561&lt;/ref&gt;

==Term==
The term Eastern Agricultural Complex (EAC) was popularized by anthropologist [[Ralph Linton]] in the 1940s. Linton suggested that the Eastern Woodland tribes integrated [[maize]] cultivation from Mexico into their own pre-existing agricultural practices.&lt;ref name = "gibbonames238"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Guy E.|last2=Ames|first2=Kenneth M.|title=Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=1998|page=238|isbn=978-0-815-30725-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnobotany|Ethnobotanists]] Volney H. Jones and Melvin R. Gilmore built upon Ralph Linton's understanding of Eastern Woodland agriculture with their work in cave and bluff dwellings in [[Kentucky]] and the [[Ozark Mountains]] in [[Arkansas]]. George Quimby also popularized the term "Eastern complex" in the 1940s. Authors Guy Gibbons and Kenneth Ames suggest that "indigenous seed crops" is a more appropriate term than "complex".&lt;ref name = "gibbonames238"/&gt;

==Cultivars==
Squash (''[[Cucurbita pepo]]'' var. ''ozarkana'') is considered to be one of the first domesticated plants in the Eastern Woodlands, having been found in the region about 7,000 years ago, though possibly not domesticated in the region until about 3,000 years ago.&lt;ref name = "gibbonames238" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nee"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nee | first1 = Michael | year = 1990 | title = The Domestication of ''Cucurbita'' (Cucurbitaceae) | journal = [[Economic Botany]] | volume = 44 | issue = 3, Supplement: New Perspectives on the Origin and Evolution of New World Domesticated Plants | pages = 56–68 | publisher = New York Botanical Gardens Press | location = New York | jstor = 4255271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tamu"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Texas A&amp;M Bioinformatics Working Group|url=http://botany.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/flcp/flcp3.htm|title=Free-living ''Cucurbita pepo'' in the United States Viral Resistance, Gene Flow, and Risk Assessment|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squash that was originally part of the complex was raised for edible seeds and to produce small containers (gourds), not for the thick flesh that is associated with modern varieties of squash.&lt;ref name="roush"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roush|first=Wade|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/276/5314/894.summary|title=Archaeobiology: Squash Seeds Yield New View of Early American Farming|journal=Science|date=9 May 1997|volume=276|issue=5314|pages=894–895 |publisher=American Association For the Advancement of Science|doi=10.1126/science.276.5314.894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bruce D.|date=22 December 1989|title=Origins of Agriculture in Eastern North America |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/246/4937/1566.abstract|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|publisher= American Association for the Advancement of Science|location=Washington, DC|doi=10.1126/science.246.4937.1566|volume=246|issue=4937|pages=1566–71|pmid=17834420}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bruce D.|date=9 May 1997|title=The Initial Domestication of Cucurbita pepo in the Americas 10,000 Years Ago |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/276/5314/932.full|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|publisher= American Association for the Advancement of Science|location=Washington, DC|doi=10.1126/science.276.5314.932|volume=276|issue=5314|pages=932–934}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cucurbita argyrosperma]]'' has been found in the region dated to circa 1300-1500 BCE.&lt;ref name="fritz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fritz | first1 = Gayle J. | year = 1994 | title = Precolumbian ''Cucurbita argyrosperma'' ssp.

Other plants of the EAC include little barley (''[[Hordeum pusillum]]''), goosefoot or lambsquarters (''[[Chenopodium berlandieri]]''), erect knotweed (''[[Polygonum erectum]]''), maygrass (''[[Phalaris caroliniana]]''), sumpweed or marsh elder (''[[Iva annua]]''), and sunflower (''[[Helianthus annuus]]'').&lt;ref name="Yarnell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yarnell|first=Richard A.|date=April 1963|title=Comments on Struever's Discussion of an Early "Eastern Agricultural Complex" |journal=[[American Antiquity]]|publisher= Society for American Archaeology|location=Washington, DC|doi=10.2307/278565|volume=28|issue=4|pages=547-548|jstor=278565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plants are often divided into "oily" or "starchy" categories. Sunflower and sumpweed have [[edible seed]]s rich in oil. Erect knotweed and goosefoot, a [[leafy vegetable]], are starches, as are maygrass and little barley,&lt;ref name="ga239"&gt;Gibbon and Ames, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are [[grass]]es that yield grains that may be ground to make flour. (Note that erect knotweed is a distinct species from the Japanese knotweed (''[[Polygonum cuspidatum]]'') that is considered an [[invasive species]] in the eastern United States today.)

[[File:Iva annua (USDA).jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Iva annua'', sumpweed, marshelder]]
The archaeological record suggests that humans were collecting these plants from the wild by 6000 BC. In the 1970s, archaeologists noticed differences between seeds found in the remains of prehistoric Native American hearths and houses and those growing in the wild.&lt;ref name="schoenwetter"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schoenwetter | first1 = James | date=April 1974 | title = Pollen Records of Guila Naquitz Cave | journal = [[American Antiquity]] | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 292–303 | publisher = Society for American Archaeology  | jstor = 279589 | doi = 10.2307/279589}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a domestic setting, the seeds of some plants were much larger than in the wild, and the seeds were easier to extract from the shells or husks. This was evidence that Indigenous gardeners were selectively breeding the plants to make them more productive and accessible.&lt;ref name="smith2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bruce D.|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/33/12223.abstract|title=Eastern North America as an Independent Center of Plant Domestication|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|publisher=National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=15 August 2006|volume=103|issue=33|pages=12223–12228|doi=10.1073/pnas.0604335103|pmid=16894156|pmc=1567861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most experts had previously believed that agriculture in the U.S. was imported from [[Mexico]], along with the trinity of subtropical crops: maize (corn), beans, and squash. What is now accepted is that the eastern United States was one of about ten regions in the world to become an "independent center of agricultural origin."&lt;ref name="smithyarnell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Bruce D. | last2 = Yarnell | first2 = Richard A. | year = 2009 | title = Initial Formation of an Indigenous Crop Complex in Eastern North America at 3800 B.P. | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | volume = 11 | issue = 16 | pages = 6561–6566 | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | jstor = 40482136 | doi = 10.2307/40482136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smith2006" /&gt;

The region of this early agriculture is in the middle [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] valley, from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] north to [[St Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and extending about 300 miles east and west of the river, mostly in [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Tennessee]]. The oldest archaeological site known in the United States in which Native Americans were growing, rather than gathering, food is Phillips Spring in Missouri.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King| first1 = Frances B. | year = 1980 | title = Plant Remains From Phillips Spring, A Multicomponent Site in the Western Ozark Highland of Missouri| journal = [[Plains Anthropologist]] | volume = 25 | issue = 89 | pages = 217–227 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd. | location = Oxfordshire, UK | jstor = 25667636 | doi=10.1080/2052546.1980.11908967}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Phillips Spring, dating from 3,000 BCE, archaeologists found abundant walnuts, hickory nuts, acorns, grapes, elderberries, ragweed, bottle gourd, and the seeds of ''[[Cucurbita pepo]]'', a gourd with edible seeds that is the ancestor of pumpkins and most squashes. The seeds found at Phillips Spring were larger than those of wild ''C. pepo''. The agency for this change was surely human manipulation. Humans were selecting, planting, and tending seeds from plants that produced larger and tastier seeds. Ultimately, they would manipulate ''C. pepo'' to produce edible flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Yarnell, p. 6562&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1800 BC, Native Americans were cultivating several different plants. The [[Riverton Site]] in the [[Wabash River]] valley of Illinois, near the present day village of [[Palestine, Illinois|Palestine]], is one of the best known early sites of cultivation. Ten house sites have been discovered at Riverton, indicating a population of 50 to 100 people in the community. Among the hearths and [[storage pit (archaeology)|storage pits]] associated with the houses, archaeologists found a large number of plant remains, including a large number of seeds of chenopods (goosefoot or lamb's quarters) which are likely cultivated plants. Some of the chenopod (''[[Chenopodium berlandieri]]'') seeds had husks only one third as thick as wild seeds. Riverton farmers had bred them selectively to produce a seed easier to access than wild varieties of the same plant.&lt;ref name="SmithYarnell" /&gt;

The wild food guru of the 1960s, [[Euell Gibbons]], gathered and ate chenopods. "In rich soil," he said, "lamb's quarters will grow four or five feet high if not disturbed, becoming much branched. It bears a heavy crop of tiny seeds in panicles at the end of every branch. In early winter, when the panicles are dry, it is quite easy to gather these seeds in considerable quantity. Just hold a pail under the branches and strip them off. Rub the husks between the hands to separate the seed and chaff, then winnow out the trash. I have collected several quarts of seed in an hour, using this method. The seeds are quite fine, being smaller than mustard seeds, and a dull blackish-brown color....I find it pretty good food for humans."&lt;ref name="GibbonsEuell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbons|first=Euell|year=1968|title=Stalking the Wild Asparagus |publisher= David McKay Company |location=New York|asin= B000FFGT1E |pages=172-173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another plant species at Riverton that can confidently be identified as domesticated was sunflower (''[[Helianthus annuus]]''). This is based on the larger size of the seed in the domesticated than in the wild varieties. Remains of plants that were used, but may or may not have been domesticated at Riverton, include bottle gourd (''[[Lagenaria siceraria]]''), squash (''C. pepo''), wild barley (''[[Hordeum pusillum]]'') and marsh elder (''[[Iva annua]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Yarnell, pp. 6562–6564&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestication==
[[File:Chenopodium berlandieri NPS-1.jpg|thumb|180px|''Chenopodium berlandieri'' or lambsquarters]]
Some of the species cultivated by Native Americans for food are today considered undesirable weeds. Another name for marshelder is sumpweed; chenopods are derisively called pigweed, although one [[South America]]n species with a more attractive name, [[quinoa]], is a [[health food store]] favorite.&lt;ref name="quinoa"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000731.htm
|title=Healthy food trends -- quinoa|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many plants considered weeds are the colonizers of disturbed soil, the first fast-growing weeds to spring up when a natural or man-made event, such as a fire, leaves a bare patch of soil.&lt;ref name = "Branhagen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Branhagen|first1=Alan|title=Native Plants of the Midwest|publisher=Timber Press|location=Portland, OR|year=2016|page=401|isbn=978-1604695939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of domestication of wild plants cannot be described with any precision. However, [[Bruce D. Smith]] and other scholars have pointed out that three of the domesticates (chenopods, ''I. annua'', and ''C. pepo'') were plants that thrived in disturbed soils in river valleys. In the aftermath of a flood, in which most of the old vegetation is killed by the high waters and bare patches of new, often very fertile, soil were created, these pioneer plants sprang up like magic, often growing in almost pure stands, but usually disappearing after a single season, as other vegetation pushed them out until the next flood.&lt;ref name="Smith2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bruce D.|date=October 2011|title=The Cultural Context of Plant Domestication in Eastern North America |journal=[[Current Anthropology]]|publisher= University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|doi=10.1086/659645|volume=52|issue=S4|pages=S471-S484|jstor=659645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Americans learned early that the seeds of these three species were edible and easily harvested in quantity because they grew in dense stands.  ''C. pepo'' was important also because the gourd could be made into a lightweight container that was useful to a seminomadic band. Chenopods have edible leaves, related to spinach and chard, that may have also been gathered and eaten by Native Americans. Chenopod seeds are starchy; marsh elder has a highly nutritious oily seed similar to sunflower seeds.&lt;ref name="Smith2011" /&gt;
[[File:Cucurbita pepo var ovifera (crop).jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Cucurbita pepo'' was bred to produce both edible squash and [[gourd]]s.]]
In gathering the seeds some were undoubtedly dropped in the sunny environment and disturbed soil of a settlement, and those seeds sprouted and thrived. Over time the seeds were sown and the ground was cleared of any competitive vegetation. The seeds which germinated quickest (i.e. thinner seed coats) and the plants which grew fastest were the most likely to be tended, harvested, and replanted. Through a process of unconscious selection and, later, conscious selection, the domesticated weeds became more productive. The seeds of some species became substantially larger and/or their seed coats were less thick compared to the wild plants. For example, the seed coats of domesticated chenopodium is less than 20 [[micron]]s thick; the wild chenopodium of the same species is 40 to 60 microns thick.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1995), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, when Native Americans quit growing these plants, as they did later, their seeds reverted within a few years to the thickness they had been in the wild.&lt;ref name = "Rivers of Change"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Bruce D. |title=Rivers of Change: Essays on Early Agriculture in Eastern North America|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, DC|year=1992|pages=49-60|isbn=978-1560981626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 500 BC, seeds produced by six domesticated plants were an important part of the diet of Native Americans in the middle Mississippi River valley of the United States.&lt;ref name = "AschHart"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asch|first1=David L.|last2=Hart|first2=John P. |title=Encyclopedia of Plant and Crop Science|chapter=Crop Domestication in Eastern North America |publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New York|year=2004|page=314|isbn=978-0824709440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction of maize==
The indigenous crops were replaced slowly by other more productive crops developed in [[Mexico]]: maize, [[bean]]s and additional varieties of squash. Maize, or corn, was a relative latecomer to the United States. The oldest known evidence of maize in Mexico dates from 6,700 BCE.&lt;ref name="Ranere"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranere|first=Anthony J., etal.|title=The Cultural and Chronological Context of Early Holocene Maize and Squash Domestication in the Central Balsas River Valley, Mexico|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|location=Washington, DC|volume=106|issue=13|year=2009|pages=5014–5018|jstor=40455140|doi=10.1073/pnas.0812590106|pmc=2664064}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest evidence of maize cultivated in the United States is about 2,100 BCE at several locations in [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Roney"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roney| first1 = John| year = 2009 | title =The Beginnings of Maize Agriculture| journal = [[Archaeology Southwest]] | volume = 23| issue = 2| page =5|location=Tucson, AZ|publisher=Archaeology Southwest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maize was first grown in the eastern United States around 200 BCE, and highly productive adapted strains became widely used around 900 CE.&lt;ref name="bdsmith1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Bruce D.|title=Origins of Agriculture in Eastern North America|journal=Science|volume=246|issue=4937|date=December 1989|pages=1566–1571|doi=10.1126/science.246.4937.1566|pmid=17834420}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread was so slow because the seeds and knowledge of techniques for tending them had to cross inhospitable deserts and mountains, and more productive varieties of maize had to be developed to compete with indigenous crops and to suit the cooler climates and shorter growing seasons of the northern regions of the continent. Tropical maize does not flower under the long day conditions of summer north of Mexico, requiring genetic adaptation.&lt;ref name="Coles"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coles|first=Nathan D., etal.|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/184/3/799|title=Genetic Control of Photoperiod Sensitivity in Maize Revealed by Joint Multiple Population Analysis|journal=[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]|publisher=Genetics Society of America|location=Bethesda, MD|volume=184|issue=3|year=2010|pages=799–812|pmc=2845347|doi=10.1534/genetics.109.110304|pmid=20008571}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that maize was adopted first as a supplement to existing agricultural plants, but gradually came to dominate as its yields increased. Ultimately, the EAC was thoroughly replaced by maize-based agriculture.&lt;ref name="ga239" /&gt; Most EAC plants are no longer cultivated, and some of them (such as little barley) are regarded as pests by modern farmers.

'''Explorer 12''' (also known as '''S3''') was a [[United States]] [[Satellite]] built to measure [[Solar wind]], [[Cosmic rays|Cosmic ray]], and [[Magnetic field]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1961-020A Explorer 12 Description] nasa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;. It was launched on August 16 1961, aboard a [[Thor-Delta]] booster&lt;ref&gt;[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftOrbit.do?id=1961-020A Explorer 12 orbit] nasa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;. Explorer 11 was the first of the 3 S3 series spacecraft. It ceased transmitting on December 6 due to power failure.

==Instruments==
[[File:Explorer 12 - Goddard Space Flight Center.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Explorer 12]]
Explorer 12 was designed to study space physics, and so had a multitude of instruments including a cosmic-ray detector, a particle trapper, and a magnetometer. Good data was recorded for 90% of the mission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27510">[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|275px|The local geometry of the universe is determined by whether the relative density Ω is less than, equal to or greater than 1. From top to bottom: a [[spherical]] universe with greater than critical density (Ω&gt;1, k&gt;0); a [[hyperbolic 3-manifold|hyperbolic]], underdense universe (Ω&lt;1, k&lt;0); and a flat universe with exactly the critical density (Ω=1, k=0). The spacetime of the universe is, unlike the diagrams, four-dimensional.]]

The '''flatness problem''' (also known as the '''oldness problem''') is a [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[fine-tuning]] problem within the [[Big Bang]] model of the universe. Such problems arise from the observation that some of the initial conditions of the universe appear to be fine-tuned to very 'special' values, and that small deviations from these values would have extreme effects on the appearance of the universe at the current time.

In the case of the [[Flatness (cosmology)|flatness]] problem, the parameter which appears fine-tuned is the [[density of the universe|density of matter and energy in the universe]]. This value affects the curvature of space-time, with a very specific [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical value]] being required for a flat universe. The current density of the universe is observed to be very close to this critical value. Since the total density departs rapidly from the critical value over [[cosmic time]],&lt;ref name="peacock"&gt;{{cite book |last= Peacock|first=J. A. |title= Cosmological Physics |date= 1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-42270-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the early universe must have had a density even closer to the critical density, departing from it by one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt; or less. This leads cosmologists to question how the initial density came to be so closely fine-tuned to this 'special' value.

The problem was first mentioned by [[Robert Dicke]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="Dicke1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert H. Dicke|title=Gravitation and the Universe: Jayne Lectures for 1969|date=1970|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0871690784}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62,}}&lt;ref name="Lightman1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan P.

==Energy density and the Friedmann equation==
According to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Einstein field equations|field equations]] of [[general relativity]], the structure of [[spacetime]] is affected by the presence of [[matter]] and energy. On small scales space appears flat &amp;ndash; as does the surface of the Earth if one looks at a small area. On large scales however, space is bent by the [[gravitational]] effect of matter. Since relativity indicates that [[Mass–energy equivalence|matter and energy are equivalent]], this effect is also produced by the presence of energy (such as light and other electromagnetic radiation) in addition to matter. The amount of bending (or [[Shape of the universe|curvature]]) of the universe depends on the density of matter/energy present.

This relationship can be expressed by the first [[Friedmann equation]]. In a universe without a [[cosmological constant]], this is:

:&lt;math&gt;H^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble parameter]], a measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding. &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the total density of mass and energy in the universe, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] (essentially the 'size' of the universe), and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the curvature parameter &amp;mdash; that is, a measure of how curved spacetime is. A positive, zero or negative value of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a respectively closed, flat or open universe. The constants &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; are Newton's [[gravitational constant]] and the [[speed of light]], respectively.

[[Cosmologists]] often simplify this equation by defining a critical density, &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt;. For a given value of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, this is defined as the density required for a flat universe, i.e. {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;k = 0&lt;/math&gt;}}. Thus the above equation implies

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_c = \frac{3H^2}{8\pi G}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the constant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is known and the expansion rate &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; can be measured by observing the speed at which distant galaxies are receding from us,
&lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt; can be determined. Its value is currently around {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;26&lt;/sup&gt; kg m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The ratio of the actual density to this critical value is called Ω, and its difference from 1 determines the geometry of the universe: {{nowrap|Ω &gt; 1}} corresponds to a greater than critical density, {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\rho &gt; \rho_c&lt;/math&gt;}}, and hence a [[closed universe]]. {{nowrap|Ω &lt; 1}} gives a low density [[open universe]], and Ω equal to exactly 1 gives a [[flat universe]].

The Friedmann equation,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3a^2}{8\pi G}H^2 = \rho a^2 - \frac{3kc^2}{8 \pi G},&lt;/math&gt;

can be re-arranged into

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_c a^2 - \rho a^2 = - \frac{3kc^2}{8 \pi G},&lt;/math&gt;

which after factoring &lt;math&gt;\rho a^2&lt;/math&gt;, and using &lt;math&gt;\Omega=\rho/\rho_c&lt;/math&gt;, leads to

:&lt;math&gt;(\Omega^{-1} - 1)\rho a^2 = \frac{-3kc^2}{8 \pi G}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Coles&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Coles |author2=Francesco Lucchin |title = Cosmology|publisher = Wiley |location = Chichester |isbn = 0-471-95473-X|date = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right hand side of the last expression above contains constants only and therefore the left hand side must remain constant throughout the evolution of the universe.

As the universe expands the scale factor &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; increases, but the density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; decreases as matter (or energy) becomes spread out. For the [[concordance cosmology|standard model of the universe]] which contains mainly matter and radiation for most of its history, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; decreases more quickly than &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt; increases, and so the factor {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\rho a^2&lt;/math&gt;}} will decrease. Since the time of the [[Planck era]], shortly after the Big Bang, this term has decreased by a factor of around &lt;math&gt;10^{60},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Coles/&gt; and so {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;(\Omega^{-1} - 1)&lt;/math&gt;}} must have increased by a similar amount to retain the constant value of their product.

==Current value of Ω==
[[File:Flatness problem density graph.svg|thumb|275px|The relative density Ω against [[cosmic time]] ''t'' (neither axis to scale). Each curve represents a possible universe: note that Ω diverges rapidly from 1. The blue curve is a universe similar to our own, which at the present time (right of the graph) has a small &amp;#124;Ω&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;#124; and therefore must have begun with Ω very close to 1 indeed. The red curve is a hypothetical different universe in which the initial value of Ω differed slightly too much from 1: by the present day it has diverged extremely and would not be able to support galaxies, stars or planets.]]

===Measurement===
The value of Ω at the present time is denoted Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. This value can be deduced by measuring the curvature of spacetime (since {{nowrap|1=Ω = 1}}, or &lt;math&gt;\rho=\rho_c&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as the density for which the curvature {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 0}}). The curvature can be inferred from a number of observations.

One such observation is that of [[anisotropies]] (that is, variations with direction - see below) in the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) radiation. The CMB is [[electromagnetic radiation]] which fills the universe, left over from an early stage in its history when it was filled with [[photons]] and a hot, dense [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This plasma cooled as the universe expanded, and when it cooled enough to form stable [[atoms]] it no longer absorbed the photons. The photons present at that stage have been propagating ever since, growing fainter and less energetic as they spread through the ever-expanding universe.

The temperature of this radiation is almost the same at all points on the sky, but there is a slight variation (around one part in 100,000) between the temperature received from different directions. The angular scale of these fluctuations - the typical angle between a hot patch and a cold patch on the sky&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Since there are fluctuations on many scales, not a single angular separation between hot and cold spots, the necessary measure is the angular scale of the first peak in the anisotropies' [[power spectrum]]. See [[Cosmic Microwave Background#Primary anisotropy]].&lt;/ref&gt; - depends on the curvature of the universe which in turn depends on its density as described above. Thus, measurements of this angular scale allow an estimation of Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Liddle&gt;{{cite book |last=Liddle |first=Andrew |title=An Introduction to Modern Cosmology |edition=2nd |date=2007 |publisher=Wiley |location=Chichester; Hoboken, NJ |page=157 |isbn=978-0-470-84835-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Liddle&lt;ref name=Liddle/&gt; uses an alternative notation in which Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the current density of [[matter]] alone, excluding any contribution from [[dark energy]]; his Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in this article.|group=nb}}

Another probe of Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the frequency of [[Type Ia supernova|Type-Ia]] [[supernovae]] at different distances from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Ryden p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cosmological Implications of the MAXIMA-1 High-Resolution Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropy Measurement |last=Stompor |first=Radek |bibcode=2001ApJ...561L...7S |date=2001 |display-authors=etal |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=561 |issue=1 |page=L7–L10 |doi=10.1086/324438|arxiv = astro-ph/0105062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These supernovae, the explosions of degenerate white dwarf stars, are a type of [[standard candle]]; this means that the processes governing their intrinsic brightness are well understood so that a measure of ''apparent'' brightness when seen from Earth can be used to derive accurate distance measures for them (the apparent brightness decreasing in proportion to the square of the distance - see [[luminosity distance]]). Comparing this distance to the [[redshift]] of the supernovae gives a measure of the rate at which the universe has been expanding at different points in history. Since the expansion rate evolves differently over time in cosmologies with different total densities, Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be inferred from the supernovae data.

Data from the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (measuring CMB anisotropies) combined with that from the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] and observations of type-Ia supernovae constrain Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to be 1 within 1%.&lt;ref name="wmap3"&gt;{{cite journal|author = D. N. Spergel|title = Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Three Year Results: Implications for Cosmology|date=June 2007|journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series|volume=170|issue = 2|pages=337–408|bibcode=2007ApJS..170..377S|doi = 10.1086/513700|arxiv = astro-ph/0603449|name-list-format=vanc|display-authors = 1|last2 = Bean|first2 = R.|last3 = Dore|first3 = O.|last4 = Nolta|first4 = M. R.|last5 = Bennett|first5 = C. L.|last6 = Dunkley|first6 = J.|last7 = Hinshaw|first7 = G.|last8 = Jarosik|first8 = N.|last9 = Komatsu|first9 = E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the term {{nowrap begin}}|Ω &amp;minus; 1|{{nowrap end}} is currently less than 0.01, and therefore must have been less than 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;62&lt;/sup&gt; at the [[Planck era]].

===Implication===
This tiny value is the crux of the flatness problem. If the initial density of the universe could take any value, it would seem extremely surprising to find it so 'finely tuned' to the critical value &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, a very small departure of Ω from 1 in the early universe would have been magnified during billions of years of expansion to create a current density very far from critical. In the case of an overdensity {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\rho &gt; \rho_c&lt;/math&gt;)}} this would lead to a universe so dense it would cease expanding and collapse into a [[Big Crunch]] (an opposite to the Big Bang in which all matter and energy falls back into an extremely dense state) in a few years or less; in the case of an underdensity {{nowrap|(&lt;math&gt;\rho &lt; \rho_c&lt;/math&gt;)}} it would expand so quickly and become so sparse it would soon seem essentially empty, and [[gravity]] would not be strong enough by comparison to cause matter to collapse and [[galaxy formation|form galaxies]]. In either case the universe would contain no complex structures such as galaxies, stars, planets and any form of life.&lt;ref&gt;Ryden p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem with the Big Bang model was first pointed out by [[Robert Dicke]] in 1969,&lt;ref name=Reality&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OIG0F37QrmQC&amp;pg=PT237&amp;lpg=PT237&amp;dq=%22flatness+problem+was%22 |title=The Reality of the Unobservable: Observability, Unobservability and Their Impact on the Issue of Scientific Realism |first=Evandro |last=Agazzi |author2=Massimo Pauri |isbn=978-0-7923-6311-8 |publisher=Springer |date=2000 |page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it motivated a search for some reason the density should take such a specific value.

==Solutions to the problem==
Some cosmologists agreed with Dicke that the flatness problem was a serious one, in need of a fundamental reason for the closeness of the density to criticality. But there was also a school of thought which denied that there was a problem to solve, arguing instead that since the universe must have some density it may as well have one close to &lt;math&gt;\rho_{crit}&lt;/math&gt; as far from it, and that speculating on a reason for any particular value was "beyond the domain of science".&lt;ref name=Reality /&gt; Enough cosmologists saw the problem as a real one, however, for various solutions to be proposed.

===Anthropic principle===
One solution to the problem is to invoke the [[anthropic principle]], which states that humans should take into account the conditions necessary for them to exist when speculating about causes of the universe's properties. If two types of universe seem equally likely but only one is suitable for the evolution of [[Sapience|intelligent life]], the anthropic principle suggests that finding ourselves in that universe is no surprise: if the other universe had existed instead, there would be no observers to notice the fact.

The principle can be applied to solve the flatness problem in two somewhat different ways. The first (an application of the 'strong anthropic principle') was suggested by [[C. B. Collins]] and [[Stephen Hawking]],&lt;ref name="Collins Hawking"&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1973ApJ...180..317C |title=Why is the Universe Isotropic? |last=Collins |first=C. B. |author2=Hawking, S. |journal=Astrophysical Journal |pages=317–334 |volume=180 |date=1973 |doi=10.1086/151965 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1973 considered the existence of an [[multiple universes|infinite number of universes]] such that every possible combination of initial properties was held by some universe. In such a situation, they argued, only those universes with exactly the correct density for forming galaxies and stars would give rise to intelligent observers such as humans: therefore, the fact that we observe Ω to be so close to 1 would be "simply a reflection of our own existence."&lt;ref name="Collins Hawking" /&gt;

An alternative approach, which makes use of the 'weak anthropic principle', is to suppose that the universe is infinite in size, but with the density varying in different places (i.e. an [[Homogeneity (physics)|inhomogeneous]] universe). Thus some regions will be over-dense {{nowrap|(Ω &gt; 1)}} and some under-dense  {{nowrap|(Ω &lt; 1)}}. These regions may be extremely far apart - perhaps so far that light has not had time to travel from one to another during the [[age of the universe]] (that is, they lie outside one another's [[Observable universe#Cosmological horizon|cosmological horizon]]s). Therefore, each region would behave essentially as a separate universe: if we happened to live in a large patch of almost-critical density we would have no way of knowing of the existence of far-off under- or over-dense patches since no light or other signal has reached us from them. An appeal to the anthropic principle can then be made, arguing that intelligent life would only arise in those patches with Ω very close to 1, and that therefore our living in such a patch is unsurprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=John D. |author2=Tiple, Frank J. |title=The Anthropic Cosmological Principle |date=1986 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-851949-4 |page=411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This latter argument makes use of a version of the anthropic principle which is 'weaker' in the sense that it requires no speculation on multiple universes, or on the probabilities of various different universes existing instead of the current one. It requires only a single universe which is infinite - or merely large enough that many disconnected patches can form - and that the density varies in different regions (which is certainly the case on smaller scales, giving rise to [[galactic cluster]]s and [[void (astronomy)|voids]]).

However, the anthropic principle has been [[Anthropic principle#Criticisms|criticised]] by many scientists.&lt;ref name="Anthropic Explanations"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001658/ | last = Mosterín | first = Jesús | title = Anthropic Explanations in Cosmology | date = 2003 | accessdate = 2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1979 [[Bernard Carr]] and [[Martin Rees]] argued that the principle “is entirely post hoc: it has not yet been used to predict any feature of the Universe.”&lt;ref name="Anthropic Explanations" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Carr |first = Bernard J. |author2=Rees, Martin |title = The anthropic principle and the structure of the physical world |date=April 1979 |journal=Nature |volume=278|issue = 5705 |pages=605–612 |bibcode=1979Natur.278..605C|doi = 10.1038/278605a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have taken objection to its philosophical basis, with [[Ernan McMullin]] writing in 1994 that "the weak Anthropic principle is trivial ... and the strong Anthropic principle is indefensible." Since many physicists and philosophers of science do not consider the principle to be compatible with the [[scientific method]],&lt;ref name="Anthropic Explanations" /&gt; another explanation for the flatness problem was needed.

===Inflation===
{{Main|Cosmic inflation}}
The standard solution to the flatness problem invokes cosmic inflation, a process whereby the universe [[expanding universe|expands]] [[exponential growth|exponentially]] quickly (i.e. &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; grows as &lt;math&gt;e^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt; with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, for some constant &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) during a short period in its early history. The theory of inflation was first proposed in 1979, and published in 1981, by [[Alan Guth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=347 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.23.347 |title=The Growth of Inflation |last=Castelvecchi  |first=Davide|bibcode = 1981PhRvD..23..347G  |date=1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.23.347 |title=Inflationary universe: A possible solution to the horizon and flatness problems |last=Guth |first=Alan |date=January 1981 |journal=[[Physical Review D]] | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–356|bibcode = 1981PhRvD..23..347G }}&lt;/ref&gt; His two main motivations for doing so were the flatness problem and the [[horizon problem]], another fine-tuning problem of physical cosmology.

The proposed cause of inflation is a [[field (physics)|field]] which permeates space and drives the expansion. The field contains a certain energy density, but unlike the density of the matter or radiation present in the late universe, which decrease over time, the density of the inflationary field remains roughly constant as space expands. Therefore, the term &lt;math&gt;\rho a^2&lt;/math&gt; increases extremely rapidly as the scale factor &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; grows exponentially. Recalling the Friedmann Equation

:&lt;math&gt;(\Omega^{-1} - 1)\rho a^2 = \frac{-3kc^2}{8\pi G}&lt;/math&gt;,

and the fact that the right-hand side of this expression is constant, the term &lt;math&gt; | \Omega^{-1} - 1 | &lt;/math&gt; must therefore decrease with time.

Thus if  &lt;math&gt; | \Omega^{-1} - 1 | &lt;/math&gt; initially takes any arbitrary value, a period of inflation can force it down towards 0 and leave it extremely small - around &lt;math&gt;10^{-62}&lt;/math&gt; as required above, for example. Subsequent evolution of the universe will cause the value to grow, bringing it to the currently observed value of around 0.01. Thus the sensitive dependence on the initial value of Ω has been removed: a large and therefore 'unsurprising' starting value need not become amplified and lead to a very curved universe with no opportunity to form galaxies and other structures.

This success in solving the flatness problem is considered one of the major motivations for inflationary theory.&lt;ref name=Ryden /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Coles |first= Peter |author2=Ellis, George F.

===Post inflation===
Although inflationary theory is regarded as having had much success, and the evidence for it is compelling, it is not universally accepted: cosmologists recognize that there are still gaps in the theory and are open to the possibility that future observations will disprove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Albrecht |first=Andreas |title=Proceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Structure Formation in the Universe, Cambridge 1999 |date=August 2000 |arxiv=astro-ph/0007247 |bibcode=2001sfu..conf...17A |isbn=1-4020-0155-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guth |first=Alan |title=Was Cosmic Inflation the 'Bang' of the Big Bang? |date=1997 |journal=The Beamline |volume=27 |url=http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Guth/Guth_contents.html |accessdate=2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, in the absence of any firm evidence for what the field driving inflation should be, many different versions of the theory have been proposed.&lt;ref name="Bird et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bird, Simeon |author2=[[Hiranya Peiris|Peiris, Hiranya V.]] |author3=Easther, Richard |title=Fine-tuning criteria for inflation and the search for primordial gravitational waves |date=July 2008 |journal=Physical Review D|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.78.083518|volume=78|issue=8|pages=083518|bibcode = 2008PhRvD..78h3518B |arxiv = 0807.3745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these contain parameters or initial conditions which themselves require fine-tuning&lt;ref name="Bird et al."/&gt; in much the way that the early density does without inflation.

For these reasons work is still being done on alternative solutions to the flatness problem. These have included non-standard interpretations of the effect of dark energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chernin |first=Arthur D. |title=Cosmic vacuum and the 'flatness problem' in the concordant model |date=January 2003 |journal=New Astronomy |volume=8|issue=1 |pages=79–83 |bibcode=2003NewA....8...79C|doi=10.1016/S1384-1076(02)00180-X|arxiv = astro-ph/0211489 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and gravity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nikolic |first=Hrvoje |title=Some Remarks on a Nongeometrical Interpretation of Gravity and the Flatness Problem |date=August 1999 |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=31|issue=8 |page=1211 |bibcode=1999GReGr..31.1211N|doi=10.1023/A:1026760304901|arxiv = gr-qc/9901057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; particle production in an oscillating universe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson |first=P.

The latter argument, suggested for example by Evrard and Coles, maintains that the idea that Ω being close to 1 is 'unlikely' is based on assumptions about the likely distribution of the parameter which are not necessarily justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evrard |first=G |author2=P. Coles |title=Getting the measure of the flatness problem |date=October 1995 |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |volume=12|issue=10 |pages=L93–L97 |bibcode=1995CQGra..12L..93E|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/12/10/001|arxiv = astro-ph/9507020 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this ongoing work, inflation remains by far the dominant explanation for the flatness problem.&lt;ref name="peacock"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ryden /&gt;

===Einstein–Cartan theory===
{{Main|Einstein–Cartan theory}}
The flatness problem is naturally solved by the [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity]], without an exotic form of matter required in inflationary theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poplawski, N. J. |date=2010 |title=Cosmology with torsion: An alternative to cosmic inflation| journal=Phys. Lett. B |volume=694 |issue=3 |pages=181–185 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.09.056|arxiv = 1007.0587 |bibcode = 2010PhLB..694..181P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poplawski, N. |date=2012 |title=Nonsingular, big-bounce cosmology from spinor-torsion coupling |journal=Phys. Rev. D |volume=85 |issue=10 |pages=107502 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.85.107502|arxiv = 1111.4595 |bibcode = 2012PhRvD..85j7502P }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the affine connection and regarding its antisymmetric part, the [[torsion tensor]], as a dynamical variable. It has no free parameters. Including torsion gives the correct conservation law for the total (orbital plus intrinsic) [[angular momentum]] of matter in the presence of gravity. The minimal coupling between torsion and Dirac spinors obeying the [[nonlinear Dirac equation]] generates a spin-spin interaction which is significant in [[fermion]]ic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction averts the unphysical big bang singularity, replacing it with a bounce at a finite minimum scale factor, before which the Universe was contracting. The rapid expansion immediately after the [[big bounce]] explains why the present Universe at largest scales appears spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic. As the density of the Universe decreases, the effects of torsion weaken and the Universe smoothly enters the radiation-dominated era.

'''Getaway Special''' was a [[NASA]] program that offered interested individuals, or groups, opportunities to fly small [[experiment]]s aboard the [[Space Shuttle]]. Over the 20-year history of the program, over 170 individual missions were flown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sspp.gsfc.nasa.gov/gas/new.html|title=Get Away Special - What's New|last=|first=|date=June 4, 2004|website=Gas Away Special - NASA GSFC|publisher=NASA GSFC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604042524/http://sspp.gsfc.nasa.gov/gas/new.html|archive-date=June 4, 2004|access-date=June 15, 2016|quote=To commemorate 20 years of flight and 167 individual missions of the Get Away Special (GAS) Program, the Shuttle Small Payloads Project Office (Code 870) held an Open House on June 27, 2002 at the Goddard Visitor Center.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which was officially known as the ''Small, Self-Contained Payloads program'', was canceled following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] on February 1, 2003.

== History ==
[[Image:GAS closeup sts-91.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Two Getaway Special (GAS) canisters, used on [[STS-91]]]]
The program was conceived by [[NASA]]'s [[Shuttle program]] manager [[John Yardley]], and announced in the fall of 1976. The "Getaway Special" nickname originated from a special vacation fare for flights between Los Angeles and Honolulu being advertised by [[Trans World Airlines]] at the time around the program's conception.

The first Getaway Special was purchased by Gilbert Moore and donated to [[Utah State University]]. It was flown on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]] during STS-4 in June/July 1982.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_004_STS-004_Press_Kit.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The program was canceled after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]] on February 1, 2003. The last Getaway Special, which was carried aboard [[STS-107]], was the [[Freestar experiment]] package, which carried six different experiments. Much of the data was lost when ''Columbia'' was destroyed, but some data was transmitted during the mission.

After reorganization of the Shuttle Program, NASA cited the need for the remaining shuttle fleet to complete assembly of the ISS to justify its decision to cancel the program. The GAS program canisters and GAS Bridge combined weight were only usable on low orbit missions, which were rescheduled with higher priority payloads. With payload and program limits set on the remaining shuttle missions until the expected STS close-out in 2010, the GAS program was eliminated.

== Allocation ==
To assure that diverse groups would have access to space, [[NASA]] rotated GAS payload assignments among four major categories of users: educational, foreign, commercial, and U.S. government. GAS payloads had been reserved by foreign governments and individuals; U.S. industrialists, foundations, high schools, colleges and universities; professional societies; service clubs; and many others. Although persons and groups involved in space research obtained many of the reservations, a large number of spaces were reserved by persons and organizations outside the space community.

GAS requests were first approved at [[NASA Headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], by the director of the Transportation Services Office. At that point NASA screened the propriety and objectives of each request. To complete the reservation process for GAS payloads, each request was accompanied or preceded by the payment of [[United States dollar|$]]500. Approved requests were assigned an identification number and referred to the GAS team at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]], the designated lead center for the project. The GAS team screened the proposals for safety and provided advice and consultation on payload design. It certified that proposed payloads would be safe and would not harm or interfere with the operations of the space shuttle, its crew, or other experiments on the flight. The costs of any physical testing required to answer safety questions before launch were borne by the GAS customer.

== Requirements ==

[[Image:GAS mounted sts-91.jpg|400px|thumb|GAS canisters shown mounted in the shuttle cargo bay. This image is from STS-91. The front of the shuttle is to the left of the picture.]]

There were no stringent requirements to qualify for participation in the GAS program. However, each [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] was required to meet specific safety criteria, have been screened for its propriety, as well as being evaluated for its educational, scientific or technological objectives. These guidelines preclude commemorative items, such as medallions, that are intended for sale as objects that have flown in space. [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle program]] had specific standards and conditions relating to GAS payloads. Payloads were required to have fit into NASA standard containers and weigh no more than {{Convert|200|lb}}. Two or more experiments could have been included in a single container if they fit while not exceeding weight limitations. The payload must have been self-powered, as experiments could not draw on the shuttle orbiter's electricity. In addition, the crew's involvement with GAS payloads was limited to six simple activities (such as turning on and off up to three payload switches), due to the fact that crew activity schedules do not provide opportunities to either monitor or service GAS payloads in flight.

The cost of this unique service depended on the size and weight of the experiment. Getaway specials of {{Convert|200|lbs}} and {{Convert|5|cuft}} cost [[United States dollar|$]]10,000; {{Convert|100|lbs}} and {{Convert|2.5|cuft}}, $5,000; and {{Convert|60|lbs}} and {{Convert|2.5|cuft}}, $3,000. The weight of the GAS container, experiment mounting plate and its attachment screws, and all hardware regularly supplied by NASA was not charged to the experimenter's weight allowance.

The GAS container provided internal [[pressure]], which could be varied from near [[vacuum]] to about one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]. The bottom and sides of the container were always [[Thermal insulation|thermally insulated]], and the top may have been insulated or not, depending on the specific experiment. A lid that could be opened, or one with a window, may be required, and were offered as options at additional cost. The GAS containers were made of [[aluminum]], and the circular end plates are &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; inch (16&amp;nbsp;mm) thick aluminum. The bottom {{Convert|3|in}} of the container were reserved for NASA interface equipment, such as [[command decoder]]s and [[pressure regulator|pressure regulating]] systems. The container was a pressure vessel that could be evacuated before or during launch, or on orbit, and could be re-pressurized during re-entry, or on orbit, as required by the experimenter.

The getaway bridge, which was capable of holding 12 canisters, made its maiden flight on [[STS-61-C]]. The aluminum bridge fit across the payload bay of the orbiter and offered a convenient and economic way of flying several GAS canisters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6317">The '''International Noble Gas Experiment''' (INGE) was formed in 1999 as an informal expert's group of developers of radioactive [[xenon]] measurement systems for the International Monitoring System for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ([[CTBT]]) (signed in 1997, but which has not entered into force).  The group originally consisted of research and development groups from [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United States]], as well as personnel from Provisional Technical Secretariat of the [[Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] [[CTBTO]].

The INGE group was formed to test aspects of measuring [[xenon]] [[fission product]] radionuclides released by [[nuclear explosions]].  The systems developed and participating in the INGE measure xenon isotopes in the atmosphere and includes &lt;sup&gt;131m&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, &lt;sup&gt;133m&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, and &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe.

Since the INGE was formed in 1999, the group has expanded somewhat and now includes R&amp;D and operational groups from many locations around the world.  Although there is no official list of INGE members, the group is informally composed of scientists, engineers, and others from Argentina, Austria, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, Russia, the United States, and several other countries.  These members regularly contribute to better understanding radioactive xenon measurements through operation of samplers, measurements of background at various locations, creation of data analysis routines, etc.

Staff from the preparatory commission of the CTBTO oversaw the experiment, with technical assistance from a German group of noble gas experts from the BfS in Freiburg, Germany.  As of 2009, the experiment was still on-going, and so far it had consisted of 3 phases:

== INGE Phase 1 ==

The first phase of the INGE experiment took place in the laboratories.  Four systems were developed to the point that they could measure xenon concentrations to specifications laid out by the [[CTBTO]] Preparatory Commission.

== INGE Phase 2 ==

The second phase of the INGE experiment took place in Freiburg, Germany, a location far away from the developers laboratories.

The four measurement systems tested in Phase 2 had favorable results in that all of the systems met [[CTBTO]] minimum specifications and agreed with the independent analyses provided by [http://www.bfs.de/bfs BfS].

== INGE Phase 3 ==

Phase 3, which was separated into a, b, and c components was designed primarily to test commercial versions of the systems designed and tested in INGE Phase 2.  The commercial version of the SAUNA (the [http://www.gammadata.se/ULNewsFiles/SAUNA_web.pdf SAUNA-II]) is now being manufactured by [http://www/gammdata.se Gammadata, Inc.] and the [http://www.environnement-sa.com/products-page/en/radionuclide-monitoring-en/automatic-radio-xenon-sampleranalyzer-en/spalax-2/ SPALAX] is being produced commercially by [http://www.environnement-sa.com/ Environnement S.A, Radionuclides Division (formerly Societé Française d’Ingenierie: SFI)].

One of the major aspects of the INGE that has been investigated is the variation of worldwide radioactive xenon backgrounds.  Concentrations of the xenon isotopes are continuously measured throughout the INGE experiment, and it has been found so far that a major source of background is medical isotope production.

There has been a number of workshops to discuss various aspects of the experiment and to discuss worldwide backgrounds of radioxenon.

His works include four novels; [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]; [[prose]] and [[verse (poetry)|verse]] dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; [[literary criticism|literary]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic criticism]]; and treatises on [[botany]], [[anatomy]], and [[colour]]. In addition, there are numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him extant.

A literary celebrity by the age of 25, Goethe was [[ennobled]] by the Duke of [[Saxe-Weimar]], [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl August]] in 1782 after taking up residence there in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774). He was an early participant in the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe was a member of the Duke's [[privy council]], sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby [[Ilmenau]], and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the [[University of Jena]]. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its [[Schloss Weimar|Ducal Palace]], which in 1998 were together designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] under the name [[Classical Weimar (World Heritage Site)|Classical Weimar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classical Weimar UNESCO Justification|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/846|work=Justification for UNESCO Heritage Cites|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe's first major scientific work, the ''[[Metamorphosis of Plants]]'', was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of Italy. In 1791, he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the [[playwright|dramatist]], historian, and philosopher [[Friedrich Schiller]], whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period, Goethe published his second novel, ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]''; the verse epic ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]'', and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]''. His conversations and various common undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], and [[August Schlegel|August]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] have come to be collectively termed [[Weimar Classicism]].

The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] named ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship'' one of the four greatest novels ever written (along with ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise|La Nouvelle Héloïse]]'', and ''[[Don Quixote]]''&lt;ref name="schopenhauer_art"&gt;{{cite web|last = Schopenhauer|first = Arthur|title = The Art of Literature|work = The Essays of Arthur Schopenahuer | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10714/pg10714.html | accessdate = 22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while the American philosopher and essayist [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] selected Goethe as one of six "representative men" in his [[Representative Men|work of the same name]] (along with [[Plato]], [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]], [[Napoleon]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]). Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, notably [[Johann Peter Eckermann]]'s ''[[Conversations with Goethe]]''.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Goethe's father, Johann Caspar Goethe, lived with his family in a large house in [[Frankfurt]], then an [[Imperial Free City]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Though he had studied law in Leipzig and had been appointed Imperial Councillor, he was not involved in the city's official affairs.&lt;ref name=Grimm36&gt;[[Herman Grimm]]: ''Goethe. Vorlesungen gehalten an der Königlichen Universität zu Berlin.'' Vol. 1. J.G. Cotta'sche Buchhandlung Nachfolger, Stuttgart / Berlin 1923, p.&amp;nbsp;36&lt;/ref&gt; Johann Caspar married Goethe's mother, [[Catharina Elisabeth Goethe|Catharina Elizabeth Textor]] at Frankfurt on 20 August 1748, when he was 38 and she was 17.&lt;ref&gt;Catharina was the daughter of Johann Wolfgang Textor, sheriff (''[[Schultheiß]]'') of Frankfurt, and Anna Margaretha Lindheimer.&lt;/ref&gt; All their children, with the exception of Johann Wolfgang and his sister, Cornelia Friederica Christiana, who was born in 1750, died at early ages.

[[File:Goethehaus-ffm011.jpg|thumb|upright|Goethe's birthplace in Frankfurt (Großer Hirschgraben)]]
His father and private tutors gave Goethe lessons in all the common subjects of their time, especially languages ([[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], French, Italian, English and Hebrew). Goethe also received lessons in dancing, [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[fencing]]. Johann Caspar, feeling frustrated in his own ambitions, was determined that his children should have all those advantages that he had not.&lt;ref name=Grimm36 /&gt;

Although Goethe's great passion was drawing, he quickly became interested in literature; [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] and [[Homer]] were among his early favorites. He had a lively devotion to theater as well and was greatly fascinated by [[puppet]] shows that were annually arranged in his home; this is a recurrent theme in his literary work ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]''.

He also took great pleasure in reading works on history and religion. He writes about this period:
{{Quotation|I had from childhood the singular habit of always learning by heart the beginnings of books, and the divisions of a work, first of the [[five books of Moses]], and then of the '[[Aeneid]]' and [[Ovid]]'s 'Metamorphoses'. ... If an ever busy imagination, of which that tale may bear witness, led me hither and thither, if the medley of fable and history, mythology and religion, threatened to bewilder me, I readily fled to those oriental regions, plunged into the first books of Moses, and there, amid the scattered shepherd tribes, found myself at once in the greatest solitude and the greatest society.&lt;ref&gt;von Goethe, Johann Wolfgang. ''The Autobiography of Goethe: truth and poetry, from my own life, Volume&amp;nbsp;1'' (1897), translated by John Oxenford, pp. 114, 129&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Goethe became also acquainted with Frankfurt actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{ill|Valerian Tornius|de}}: ''Goethe – Leben, Wirken und Schaffen''. Ludwig-Röhrscheid-Verlag, Bonn 1949, p.&amp;nbsp;26&lt;/ref&gt; Among early literary attempts, he was infatuated with ''Gretchen'', who would later reappear in his ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' and the adventures with whom he would concisely describe in ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Ludwig]]: Goethe – Geschichte eines Menschen. Vol.&amp;nbsp;1. Ernst-Rowohlt-Verlag, Berlin 1926, pp.&amp;nbsp;17–18&lt;/ref&gt; He adored Caritas Meixner (27 July 1750&amp;nbsp;– 31 December 1773), a wealthy [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] trader's daughter and friend of his sister, who would later marry the merchant G.&amp;nbsp;F.&amp;nbsp;Schuler.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Goedeke]]: Goethes Leben. ''Cotta / Kröner'', Stuttgart around 1883, pp.&amp;nbsp;16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal career ===
[[File:Annakatharinaschoenkopf.png|thumb|upright|[[Anna Katharina Schönkopf|Anna Katharina (''Käthchen'') Schönkopf]]]]
Goethe studied law at [[Leipzig University]] from 1765 to 1768. He detested learning age-old judicial rules by heart, preferring instead to attend the poetry lessons of [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert]]. In Leipzig, Goethe fell in love with Anna Katharina Schönkopf and wrote cheerful verses about her in the [[Rococo]] genre. In 1770, he anonymously released ''Annette'', his first collection of poems. His uncritical admiration for many contemporary poets vanished as he became interested in [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]. Already at this time, Goethe wrote a good deal, but he threw away nearly all of these works, except for the comedy ''Die Mitschuldigen''. The restaurant [[Auerbachs Keller]] and its legend of [[Johann Georg Faust|Faust's]] 1525 barrel ride impressed him so much that Auerbachs Keller became the only real place in his [[closet drama]] ''[[Faust Part One]]''. As his studies did not progress, Goethe was forced to return to Frankfurt at the close of August 1768.

Goethe became severely ill in Frankfurt. During the year and a half that followed, because of several relapses, the relationship with his father worsened. During convalescence, Goethe was nursed by his mother and sister. In April 1770, Goethe left Frankfurt in order to finish his studies at the [[University of Strasbourg]].

In [[Alsace]], Goethe blossomed. No other landscape has he described as affectionately as the warm, wide Rhine area. In Strasbourg, Goethe met [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]. The two became close friends, and crucially to Goethe's intellectual development, Herder kindled his interest in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Ossian]] and in the notion of ''Volkspoesie'' (folk poetry). On 14 October 1772 Goethe held a gathering in his parental home in honour of the first German "Shakespeare Day". His first acquaintance with Shakespeare's works is described as his personal awakening in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-duisburg-essen.de/einladung/Vorlesungen/dramatik/goetheshak.htm |title=Originally speech of Goethe to the '&amp;#39;Shakespeare's Day'&amp;#39; by University Duisburg |publisher=Uni-duisburg-essen.de |date= |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a trip to the village [[Sessenheim]], Goethe fell in love with [[Friederike Brion]], in October 1770,&lt;ref&gt;Herman Grimm: ''Goethe. Vorlesungen gehalten an der Königlichen Universität zu Berlin.'' Vol. 1. J.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Cotta'sche Buchhandlung Nachfolger, Stuttgart / Berlin 1923, p.&amp;nbsp;81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow, Bodo Morawe: Goethes Briefe. 2. edition. Vol. 1: Briefe der Jahre 1764–1786. ''Christian Wegner'', Hamburg 1968, p. 571&lt;/ref&gt; but, after ten months, terminated the relationship in August 1771.&lt;ref&gt;Valerian Tornius: ''Goethe – Leben, Wirken und Schaffen''. Ludwig-Röhrscheid-Verlag, Bonn 1949, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Several of his poems, like "{{lang|de|Willkommen und Abschied}}", "{{lang|de|Sesenheimer Lieder}}" and "{{lang|de|Heidenröslein}}", originate from this time.

At the end of August 1771, Goethe acquired the academic degree of the ''Lizenziat'' ([[Licentia docendi]]) in Frankfurt and established a small legal practice. Although in his academic work he had expressed the ambition to make [[jurisprudence]] progressively more humane, his inexperience led him to proceed too vigorously in his first cases, and he was reprimanded and lost further ones. This prematurely terminated his career as a lawyer after only a few months. At this time, Goethe was acquainted with the court of [[Darmstadt]], where his inventiveness was praised. From this milieu came Johann Georg Schlosser (who was later to become his brother-in-law) and [[Johann Heinrich Merck]]. Goethe also pursued literary plans again; this time, his father did not have anything against it, and even helped. Goethe obtained a copy of the biography of a [[Nobility|noble]] [[highwayman]] from the [[German Peasants' War]]. In a couple of weeks the biography was reworked into a colourful drama. Entitled ''[[Götz von Berlichingen (Goethe)|Götz von Berlichingen]],'' the work went directly to the heart of Goethe's contemporaries.

Goethe could not subsist on being one of the editors of a literary periodical (published by Schlosser and Merck). In May 1772 he once more began the practice of law at [[Wetzlar]]. In 1774 he wrote the book which would bring him worldwide fame, ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''. The outer shape of the work's plot is widely taken over from what Goethe experienced during his Wetzlar time with [[Charlotte Buff]] (1753–1828)&lt;ref name="KestnerAndLotte"&gt;Mandelkow, Karl Robert (1962).

=== Early years in Weimar ===
[[File:goethe.png|thumb|upright|Goethe in c. 1775]]
In 1775, Goethe was invited, on the strength of his fame as the author of ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', to the court of [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], who would become [[Grand Duke]] in 1815. (The Duke at the time was 18 years of age, to Goethe's&amp;nbsp;26.) Goethe thus went to live in [[Weimar]], where he remained for the rest of his life and where, over the course of many years, he held a succession of offices, becoming the Duke's friend and chief adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Peter|last=Hume Brown|authorlink=Peter Hume Brown|title=Life of Goethe|year=1920|pages=224–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.klassik-stiftung.de/uploads/tx_lombkswdigitaldocs/Jahrbuch_2007_Mueller.pdf "Goethe und Carl August – Freundschaft und Politik"] by Gerhard Müller, in Th. Seemann (ed.): ''Anna Amalia, Carl August und das Ereignis Weimar''. Jahrbuch der Klassik Stiftung Weimar 2007. Göttingen: Wallstein Verlag, pp. 132–64 {{icon de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776, Goethe formed a close relationship to [[Charlotte von Stein]], an older, married woman. The intimate bond with von Stein lasted for ten years, after which Goethe abruptly left for Italy without giving his companion any notice. She was emotionally distraught at the time, but they were eventually reconciled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Stein, Charlotte von}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe, aside from official duties, was also a friend and confidant to the Duke, and participated fully in the activities of the court. For Goethe, his first ten years at Weimar could well be described as a garnering of a degree and range of experience which perhaps could be achieved in no other way. In 1779, Goethe took on the War Commission of the Grand Duchy of [[Saxe-Weimar]], in addition to the Mines and Highways commissions. In 1782, when the chancellor of the Duchy's Exchequer left his office, Goethe agreed to act in his place for two and a half years; this post virtually made him prime minister and the principal representative of the Duchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|237027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] in 1782 (this being indicated by the "[[von]]" in his name).

As head of the Saxe-Weimar War Commission, Goethe participated in the recruitment of mercenaries into the Prussian and British military during the American Revolution.  The author W. Daniel Wilson claims that Goethe engaged in negotiating the forced sale of vagabonds, criminals, and political dissidents as part of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Goethe-Tabu|last=Wilson|first=W.

=== Italy ===
[[File:Der junge Goethe, gemalt von Angelica Kauffmann 1787.JPG|thumb|upright|Goethe, age 38, painted by [[Angelica Kauffman]] 1787]]
Goethe's journey to the [[Italian peninsula]] and Sicily from 1786 to 1788 was of great significance in his aesthetic and philosophical development. His father had made a similar journey during his own youth, and his example was a major motivating factor for Goethe to make the trip. More importantly, however, the work of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] had provoked a general renewed interest in the classical [[Ancient Greek art|art of ancient Greece]] and [[Roman art|Rome]]. Thus Goethe's journey had something of the nature of a pilgrimage to it. During the course of his trip Goethe met and befriended the artists [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein]], as well as encountering such notable characters as [[Emma, Lady Hamilton|Lady Hamilton]] and [[Alessandro Cagliostro]] (see [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]]).

He also journeyed to Sicily during this time, and wrote intriguingly that "To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is to not have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything." While in Southern Italy and Sicily, Goethe encountered, for the first time genuine Greek (as opposed to Roman) architecture, and was quite startled by its relative simplicity. Winckelmann had not recognized the distinctness of the two styles.

Goethe's diaries of this period form the basis of the non-fiction ''[[Italian Journey]]''. ''Italian Journey'' only covers the first year of Goethe's visit. The remaining year is largely undocumented, aside from the fact that he spent much of it in [[Venice]]. This "gap in the record" has been the source of much speculation over the years.

In the decades which immediately followed its publication in 1816, ''Italian Journey'' inspired countless German youths to follow Goethe's example. This is pictured, somewhat satirically, in [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Middlemarch]]''.

=== Weimar ===
[[File:Freiheitsbaum.jpg|thumb|A Goethe watercolour depicting a [[liberty pole]] at the border to the short-lived [[Republic of Mainz]], created under influence of the French Revolution and destroyed in the [[Siege of Mainz (1793)|Siege of Mainz]] in which Goethe participated]]
In late 1792, Goethe took part in the [[Battle of Valmy]] against [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]], assisting Duke [[Carl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl August]] of [[Saxe-Weimar|Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] during the failed invasion of France. Again during the Siege of Mainz he assisted Carl August as a military observer. His written account of these events can be found within his ''Complete Works.''

In 1794, [[Friedrich Schiller]] wrote to Goethe offering friendship; they had previously had only a mutually wary relationship ever since first becoming acquainted in 1788. This collaborative friendship lasted until Schiller's death in 1805.

[[File:Johann Wolfgang Goethe 1811.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|left|Goethe, by Luise Seidler (Weimar 1811)]]

In 1806, Goethe was living in Weimar with his mistress [[Christiane Vulpius]], the sister of [[Christian August Vulpius|Christian A Vulpius]], and their son Julius August Walter von Goethe. On 13 October, [[Napoleon]]'s army invaded the town. The French "spoon guards," the least disciplined soldiers, occupied Goethe's house: {{quote|The 'spoon guards' had broken in, they had drunk wine, made a great uproar and called for the master of the house. Goethe's secretary Riemer reports: 'Although already undressed and wearing only his wide nightgown... he descended the stairs towards them and inquired what they wanted from him.... His dignified figure, commanding respect, and his spiritual mien seemed to impress even them.' But it was not to last long. Late at night they burst into his bedroom with drawn bayonets. Goethe was petrified, Christiane raised a lot of noise and even tangled with them, other people who had taken refuge in Goethe's house rushed in, and so the marauders eventually withdrew again. It was Christiane who commanded and organized the defense of the house on the Frauenplan. The barricading of the kitchen and the cellar against the wild pillaging soldiery was her work. Goethe noted in his diary: "Fires, rapine, a frightful night... Preservation of the house through steadfastness and luck." The luck was Goethe's, the steadfastness was displayed by Christiane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Safranski|first=Rüdiger|title=Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy | publisher=Harvard University Press | year = 1990 |isbn= 0-674-79275-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Days afterward, on 19 October 1806, Goethe legitimized their 18-year relationship by marrying Christiane in a quiet marriage service at the {{ill|Jakobskirche (Weimar)|de|lt=Jakobskirche in Weimar}}. They had already had several children together by this time, including their son, Julius August Walter von Goethe (25 December 1789 – 28 October 1830), whose wife, {{ill|Ottilie von Goethe|de|lt=Ottilie von Pogwisch}} (31 October 1796 – 26 October 1872), cared for the elder Goethe until his death in 1832. August and Ottilie had three children: [[Walther von Goethe|Walther, Freiherr von Goethe]] (9 April 1818 – 15 April 1885), {{ill|Wolfgang Maximilian von Goethe|de|lt=Wolfgang, Freiherr von Goethe}} (18 September 1820 – 20 January 1883) and {{ill|Alma von Goethe|de}} (29 October 1827 – 29 September 1844). Christiane von Goethe died in 1816.

[[File:Ulrike von Levetzow.jpg|upright|thumb|Ulrike von Levetzow]]

=== Later life ===
After 1793, Goethe devoted his endeavours primarily to literature. By 1820, Goethe was on amiable terms with [[Kaspar Maria von Sternberg]].
In 1823, having recovered from a near fatal heart illness, Goethe fell in love with [[Ulrike von Levetzow]] whom he wanted to marry, but because of the opposition of her mother he never proposed. Their last meeting in [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]] on 5 September 1823 inspired him to the famous ''[[Marienbad Elegy]]'' which he considered one of his finest works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamelika.cz/SHAMELIKA/1974/1974_16/h74_16.htm|title=Goethe's third summer}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time he also developed a deep emotional bond with the Polish pianist [[Maria Agata Szymanowska]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1821 Goethe's friend [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]] introduced him to the 12 year old [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. Goethe, now in his seventies, was greatly impressed by the child, leading to perhaps the earliest confirmed comparison with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] in the following conversation between Goethe and Zelter:

{{quote|"Musical prodigies&amp;nbsp;... are probably no longer so rare; but what this little man can do in extemporizing and playing at sight borders the miraculous, and I could not have believed it possible at so early an age." "And yet you heard Mozart in his seventh year at Frankfurt?" said Zelter. "Yes", answered Goethe, "...&amp;nbsp;but what your pupil already accomplishes, bears the same relation to the Mozart of that time that the cultivated talk of a grown-up person bears to the prattle of a child."{{sfn|Todd|2003|p=89}}}}

Mendelssohn was invited to meet Goethe on several later occasions,{{sfn|Mercer-Taylor|2000|pp=41–2, 93}} and set a number of Goethe's poems to music. His other compositions inspired by Goethe include the overture ''[[Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage (Mendelssohn)|Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage]]'' (Op. 27, 1828), and the cantata ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht]]'' (''The First Walpurgis Night'', Op. 60, 1832).{{sfn|Todd|2003|pp=188–190, 269–270}}

=== Death ===
[[File:Särge Goethe und Schiller.jpg|thumb|Coffins of Goethe and Schiller, Weimar vault]]
In 1832, Goethe died in [[Weimar]] of apparent heart failure. His last words, according to his doctor Carl Vogel, were, ''{{Lang|de|Mehr Licht!}}'' (More light!), but this is disputed as Vogel was not in the room at the moment Goethe died.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Vogel: "Die letzte Krankheit Goethe's". In: ''Journal der practischen Heilkunde'' (1833).&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in the [[Weimarer Fürstengruft|Ducal Vault]] at Weimar's [[Historical Cemetery, Weimar|Historical Cemetery]].

[[Johann Peter Eckermann|Eckermann]] closes his famous work, ''[[Conversations with Goethe]]'', with this passage:
{{Quotation|The morning after Goethe's death, a deep desire seized me to look once again upon his earthly garment. His faithful servant, Frederick, opened for me the chamber in which he was laid out. Stretched upon his back, he reposed as if asleep; profound peace and security reigned in the features of his sublimely noble countenance. The mighty brow seemed yet to harbour thoughts. I wished for a lock of his hair; but reverence prevented me from cutting it off. The body lay naked, only wrapped in a white sheet; large pieces of ice had been placed near it, to keep it fresh as long as possible. Frederick drew aside the sheet, and I was astonished at the divine magnificence of the limbs. The breast was powerful, broad, and arched; the arms and thighs were elegant, and of the most perfect shape; nowhere, on the whole body, was there a trace of either fat or of leanness and decay. A perfect man lay in great beauty before me; and the rapture the sight caused me made me forget for a moment that the immortal spirit had left such an abode. I laid my hand on his heart – there was a deep silence – and I turned away to give free vent to my suppressed tears.}}

The first production of [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' took place in Weimar in 1850. The conductor was [[Franz Liszt]], who chose the date 28 August in honour of Goethe, who was born on 28 August 1749.&lt;ref&gt;Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary work ==
[[File:-1- Die Leiden des jungen Werthers. Erstdruck.jpg|thumb|First edition of ''The Sorrows of Young Werther'']]

=== Overview ===
The most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to Weimar were ''[[Götz von Berlichingen (Goethe)|Götz von Berlichingen]]'' (1773), a tragedy that was the first work to bring him recognition, and the novel ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (German: ''Die Leiden des jungen Werthers'') (1774), which gained him enormous fame as a writer in the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' period which marked the early phase of [[Romanticism]]. Indeed, ''Werther'' is often considered to be the "spark" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first "best-seller."  During the years at Weimar before he met [[Schiller]] he began ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'', wrote the dramas ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris (Goethe)|Iphigenie auf Tauris]]'' (''Iphigenia in Tauris''), ''[[Egmont (play)|Egmont]]'', ''[[Torquato Tasso (play)|Torquato Tasso]]'', and the fable ''[[Reineke Fuchs]]''.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the conception of ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Journeyman Years]]'' (the continuation of ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship''), the [[idyll]] of ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]'', the ''[[Roman Elegies]] '' and the verse drama ''[[The Natural Daughter]]''. In the last period, between Schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared ''[[Faust Part One]]'', ''[[Elective Affinities]]'', the ''[[West–östlicher Divan|West-Eastern Diwan]]'' (a collection of poems in the Persian style, influenced by the work of [[Hafez]]), his autobiographical ''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit|Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit]]'' (''From My Life: Poetry and Truth'') which covers his early life and ends with his departure for Weimar, his ''[[Italian Journey]]'', and a series of treatises on art. His writings were immediately influential in literary and artistic circles.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Goethe was fascinated by [[Kalidasa]]'s ''[[Abhijñānaśākuntalam]]'', which was one of the first works of [[Sanskrit literature]] that became known in Europe, after being translated from English to German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix-RShGgZUAC&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Sanskrit Drama in Performance |first1=Rachel Van M. |last1=Baumer |first2=James R. |last2=Brandon |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1993 |origyear=1981 |isbn=9788120807723 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Details of selected works ===
The short [[epistolary novel]], ''Die Leiden des jungen Werthers'', or ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'', published in 1774, recounts an unhappy romantic infatuation that ends in suicide. Goethe admitted that he "shot his hero to save himself": a reference to Goethe's own near-suicidal obsession with a young woman during this period, an obsession he quelled through the writing process. The novel remains in print in dozens of languages and its influence is undeniable; its central hero, an obsessive figure driven to despair and destruction by his unrequited love for the young Lotte, has become a pervasive literary [[archetype]]. The fact that ''Werther'' ends with the protagonist's suicide and funeral—a funeral which "no clergyman attended"—made the book deeply controversial upon its (anonymous) publication, for on the face of it, it appeared to condone and glorify suicide. Suicide is considered sinful by [[Christian doctrine]]: suicides were denied [[Christian burial]] with the bodies often mistreated and dishonoured in various ways; in corollary, the deceased's property and possessions were often confiscated by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pipsproject.com/Understanding%20Suicide.html|publisher=Pips Project|title=The Stigma of Suicide – A history|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006120251/http://pipsproject.com/Understanding%20Suicide.html|archivedate=6 October 2007|df=dmy-all}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://elsinore.ucsc.edu/burial/burialSuicide.html|title=Ophelia's Burial}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Goethe explained his use of ''Werther'' in his autobiography. He said he "turned reality into poetry but his friends thought poetry should be turned into reality and the poem imitated." He was against this reading of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyofg00goet#page/502/mode/2up ''The Autobiography of Goethe'' Book 13 pp. 502ff]&lt;/ref&gt; Epistolary novels were common during this time, letter-writing being a primary mode of communication. What set Goethe's book apart from other such novels was its expression of unbridled longing for a joy beyond possibility, its sense of defiant rebellion against authority, and of principal importance, its total subjectivity: qualities that trailblazed the Romantic movement.

The next work, his epic [[closet drama]] ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', was completed in stages. The first part was published in 1808 and created a sensation. Goethe finished ''[[Faust Part Two]]'' in the year of his death, and the work was published posthumously. Goethe's original draft of a Faust play, which probably dates from 1773–74, and is now known as the ''Urfaust'', was also published after his death.

The first operatic version of Goethe's Faust, by [[Louis Spohr]], appeared in 1814. The work subsequently inspired operas and oratorios by [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Gounod]], [[Boito]], [[Busoni]], and [[Schnittke]] as well as symphonic works by [[Liszt]], [[Wagner]], and [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]. Faust became the [[wikt:ur-|ur-]]myth of many figures in the 19th century. Later, a facet of its plot, i.e., of selling one's soul to the devil for power over the physical world, took on increasing literary importance and became a view of the victory of technology and of industrialism, along with its dubious human expenses. In 1919, the [[world premiere]] complete production of Faust was staged at the [[Goetheanum]].

[[File:Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein - Goethe in the Roman Campagna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Goethe in the Roman Campagna'' (1786) by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|Tischbein]]]]

Goethe's poetic work served as a model for an entire movement in German poetry termed ''Innerlichkeit'' ("introversion") and represented by, for example, [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]]. Goethe's words inspired a number of compositions by, among others, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] (who idolised Goethe),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wigmore|first=Richard|title=A meeting of genius: Beethoven and Goethe, July 1812|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/focus/a-meeting-of-genius-beethoven-and-goethe-july-1812|work=Gramophone|publisher=Haymarket|accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Berlioz]] and [[Hugo Wolf|Wolf]]. Perhaps the single most influential piece is "Mignon's Song" which opens with one of the most famous lines in German poetry, an allusion to Italy: "''{{lang|de|Kennst du das Land, wo die Zitronen blühn}}''?" ("Do you know the land where the lemon trees bloom?").

He is also widely quoted. Epigrams such as "Against criticism a man can neither protest nor defend himself; he must act in spite of it, and then it will gradually yield to him", "[[Divide and rule]], a sound motto; unite and lead, a better one", and "Enjoy when you can, and endure when you must", are still in usage or are often paraphrased. Lines from ''Faust'', such as "{{lang|de|Das also war des Pudels Kern}}", "{{lang|de|Das ist der Weisheit letzter Schluss}}", or "{{lang|de|Grau ist alle Theorie}}" have entered everyday German usage.

Some well-known quotations are often incorrectly attributed to Goethe. These include [[Hippocrates]]' "Art is long, life is short", which is echoed in Goethe's ''Faust'' and ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship''.

=== Creativity and crisis ===
Goethe overcame emotional turmoil, relational conflicts and mood swings through self-reflection, political and scientific work, and writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|authorlink=Rainer M. Holm-Hadulla|year=2012|title=Goethe's Anxieties, Depressive Episodes and (Self-) Therapeutic Strategies: A Contribution to Method Integration in Psychotherapy|journal=[[Psychopathology (journal)|Psychopathology]]|number=46|pages=266–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holm-Hadulla|first=Rainer Matthias|authorlink=Rainer M.

Goethe"|journal=[[Journal of Affective Disorders]]|number=127|pages=43–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; His striving to come to terms with adverse life events began with the death of his brother Hermann Jakob when Johann Wolfgang was ten years old and continued as he met emotional crises in his adolescence: "And thus began that habit from which I could not break away my whole life through – the habit of turning into an image, into a poem, whatever delighted or troubled, or otherwise occupied me, and thus of coming to some definite conclusion with regard to it, so that I might both rectify my conceptions of external things and satisfy my inner cravings. To no one was the faculty for so doing more necessary than to me, for by nature I was constantly carried from one extreme to the other".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit|Poetry and Truth]]'', vol. 1, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific work ==
{{See also|Goethean science}}
{{Quotation|As to what I have done as a poet,... I take no pride in it... But that in my century I am the only person who knows the truth in the difficult science of colours—of that, I say, I am not a little proud, and here I have a consciousness of a superiority to many.|[[Johann Eckermann]], ''Conversations with Goethe''}}

Although his literary work has attracted the greatest amount of interest, Goethe was also keenly involved in studies of natural science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natureinstitute.org/about/who/goethe.htm |publisher=[[The Nature Institute]]|title=Johann Wolfgang von Goethe |accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote several works on [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and colour theory. Goethe also had the largest private collection of minerals in all of Europe. By the time of his death, in order to gain a comprehensive view in geology, he had collected 17,800 rock samples.

His focus on morphology and what was later called [[Homology (biology)|homology]] influenced 19th century [[natural history|naturalists]], although his ideas of transformation were about the continuous metamorphosis of living things and did not relate to contemporary ideas of "transformisme" or [[transmutation of species]]. Homology, or as [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] called it "analogie", was used by [[Charles Darwin]] as strong evidence of [[common descent]] and of [[Genetic variability|laws of variation]].&lt;ref name="darwin1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=C.

The elephant's skull that led Goethe to this discovery, and was subsequently named the Goethe Elephant, still exists and is displayed in the [[Ottoneum]] in [[Kassel]], Germany.

During his Italian journey, Goethe formulated a theory of plant metamorphosis in which the archetypal form of the plant is to be found in the ''leaf'' – he writes, "from top to bottom a plant is all leaf, united so inseparably with the future bud that one cannot be imagined without the other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goethe |first=J.W. |title=Italian Journey |publisher=Suhrkamp ed., vol. 6 | others = Robert R Heitner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, he published his ''[[Metamorphosis of Plants]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/agr08000317/|title=Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu Erklären|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0Fjuaog1_E0C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=intermaxillary+bone+prove|title=Metamorphosis of Plants|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=28 August 2008|isbn=978-1-4179-4984-7|author1=Magnus, Rudolf|author2=Schmid, Gunther|date=20 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the many precursors in the history of evolutionary thought, Goethe wrote in ''Story of My Botanical Studies'' (1831):

{{quote|The ever-changing display of plant forms, which I have followed for so many years, awakens increasingly within me the notion: The plant forms which surround us were not all created at some given point in time and then locked into the given form, they have been given... a felicitous mobility and plasticity that allows them to grow and adapt themselves to many different conditions in many different places.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Teichmann (tr. Jon McAlice) [http://www.waldorfresearchinstitute.org/pdf/BAIdeaEvolTeich.pdf "The Emergence of the Idea of Evolution in the Time of Goethe"] first published in ''Interdisciplinary Aspects of Evolution'', Urachhaus (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Goethe's botanical theories were partly based on his [[gardening]] in Weimar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Balzer |first=Georg |date=1966 |title=Goethe als Gartenfreund |url= |location=München |publisher=F. Bruckmann KG |page= |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe also popularized the [[Goethe barometer]] using a principle established by [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]]. According to Hegel, "Goethe has occupied himself a good deal with meteorology; barometer readings interested him particularly... What he says is important: the main thing is that he gives a comparative table of barometric readings during the whole month of December 1822, at Weimar, [[Jena]], London, Boston, Vienna, [[Töpel]]... He claims to deduce from it that the barometric level varies in the same proportion not only in each zone but that it has the same variation, too, at different altitudes above sea-level".&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, ''Hegel's Philosophy of Nature: Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences'' (1830), part 2 translated by A. V. Miller, illustrated, reissue, reprint Oxford University Press, 2005 {{ISBN|0-19-927267-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-927267-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pQnOQlowPKMC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=goethe+meteorological&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eduT8lOGxy&amp;sig=zun-13l87QStdGwKa775wQw9Bd4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tUzlSY6DMZfIM7SbmYoJ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#PPA129,M1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810, Goethe published his ''[[Theory of Colours]]'', which he considered his most important work. In it, he contentiously characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of light and darkness through the mediation of a turbid medium.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle [https://books.google.com/books?id=aZGwq6KPmfAC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=aristotle+%2B+%22de+sensu%22+%2B+white+and+black+may+be+juxtaposed%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false wrote] that colour is a mixture of light and dark, since white light is always seen as somewhat darkened when it is seen as a colour. (Aristotle, ''On Sense and its Objects'', III, 439b, 20 ff.: "White and black may be juxtaposed in such a way that by the minuteness of the division of its parts each is invisible while their product is visible, and thus colour may be produced.")&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] went on to develop his own theory in ''[[On&amp;nbsp;Vision and Colors|On Vision and Colours]]'' based on the observations supplied in Goethe's book. After being translated into English by [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]] in 1840, his theory became widely adopted by the art world, most notably [[J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bockemuhl |first=M. |title=Turner |publisher=Taschen, Koln |year=1991|isbn=3-8228-6325-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe's work also inspired the philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], to write his ''[[Remarks on Colour]]''. Goethe was vehemently opposed to [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] analytic treatment of colour, engaging instead in compiling a comprehensive ''rational description'' of a wide variety of colour phenomena. Although the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern Science. Goethe was, however, the first to systematically study the physiological effects of colour, and his observations on the effect of opposed colours led him to a symmetric arrangement of his colour wheel, 'for the colours diametrically opposed to each other... are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. (Goethe, ''[http://theoryofcolor.org/Physiological+Colours#par50 Theory of Colours]'', 1810).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goethe |first=Johann |url=http://theoryofcolor.org/Physiological+Colours#par50 |title=Theory of Colours, paragraph No. 50 |year=1810}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, he anticipated [[Ewald Hering]]'s [[Opponent process|opponent colour theory]] (1872).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webexhibits.org/colorart/ch.html |title=Goethe's Color Theory|accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe outlines his method in the essay ''The experiment as mediator between subject and object'' (1772).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Experiment as Mediator between Subject and Object|accessdate=26 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110082845/http://pages.slc.edu/~eraymond/bestfoot.html|url=http://pages.slc.edu/~eraymond/bestfoot.html|archivedate=10 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Kurschner edition of Goethe's works, the science editor, [[Rudolf Steiner]], presents Goethe's approach to science as [[phenomenological model|phenomenological]]. Steiner elaborated on that in the books ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/English/AP1985/GA002_index.html |title=The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception|accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Goethe's World View'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA006/English/MP1985/GA006_index.html |title=Goethe's World View|accessdate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he characterizes intuition as the instrument by which one grasps Goethe's biological archetype—''The Typus''.

[[Novalis]], himself a geologist and mining engineer, expressed the opinion that Goethe was the first physicist of his time and 'epoch-making in the history of physics', writing that Goethe's studies of light, of the metamorphosis of plants and of insects were indications and proofs 'that the perfect educational lecture belongs in the artist's sphere of work'; and that Goethe would be surpassed 'but only in the way in which the ancients can be surpassed, in inner content and force, in variety and depth—as an artist actually not, or only very little, for his rightness and intensity are perhaps already more exemplary than it would seem'.

== Eroticism ==
Many of Goethe's works, especially ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', the ''[[Roman Elegies]]'', and the ''Venetian Epigrams'', depict erotic passions and acts. For instance, in ''Faust'', the first use of Faust's power after signing a contract with the devil is to seduce a teenage girl. Some of the ''Venetian Epigrams'' were held back from publication due to their sexual content. Goethe clearly saw [[human sexuality]] as a topic worthy of poetic and artistic depiction, an idea that was uncommon in a time when the private nature of sexuality was rigorously normative.&lt;ref&gt;''Outing Goethe and His Age''; edited by Alice A. Kuzniar.{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in his novel [[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]], Goethe described the beauty of the male body, he was attracted to women, starting with his first love "Gretchen" when he was 14 and ending with [[Ulrike von Levetzow]] when he was 73.&lt;ref&gt; Holm-Hadulla, Rainer Matthias (2018): Goethe's Path to Creativity.

In a conversation on April 7 1830 Goethe stated that [[pederasty]] is an "aberration" that easily leads to "animal, roughly material" behavior. He continued, "Pederasty is as old as humanity itself, and one can therefore say, that it resides in nature, even if it proceeds against nature....What culture has won from nature will not be surrendered or given up at any price."&lt;ref name="Gedenkausgabe der Werke, Briefe und Gespräche"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goethe |first1=Johann Wolfgang |title=Gedenkausgabe der Werke, Briefe und Gespräche |date=1976 |publisher=Zürich : Artemis Verl. |asin=B003SEWCVU |page=686 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Gedenkausgabe_der_Werke_Briefe_und_Gespr.html?id=hX_fAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion he wrote, somewhat ambiguously: "I like boys a lot, but the girls are even nicer.

== Religion and politics ==
Goethe was a [[freethinkers|freethinker]] who believed that one could be inwardly Christian without following any of the Christian churches, many of whose central teachings he firmly opposed, sharply distinguishing between Christ and the tenets of Christian theology, and criticizing its history as a "hodgepodge of fallacy and violence".&lt;ref&gt;The phrase Goethe uses is "Mischmasch von Irrtum und Gewalt", in his "Zahme Xenien" IX, ''Goethes Gedichte in Zeitlicher Folge'', Insel Verlag 1982 {{ISBN|3458140131}}, p. 1121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Bergsträsser, "Goethe's View of Christ", ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 46, No. 3 (Feb. 1949), pp. 172–202; M.

The cross symbol he drew has been variously understood as meaning Christianity, Christ, or death.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], Goethe had "a kind of almost ''joyous'' and ''trusting fatalism''" that has "faith that only in the totality everything redeems itself and appears good and justified."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', § 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Born into a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] family, Goethe's early faith was shaken by news of such events as the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] and the [[Seven Years' War]]. His later spiritual perspective incorporated elements of [[pantheism]] (heavily influenced by [[Spinoza]]), [[humanism]], and various elements of Western [[esotericism]], as seen most vividly in Part II of ''Faust''. A year before his death, in a letter to [[Sulpiz Boisserée]], Goethe wrote that he had the feeling that all his life he had been aspiring to qualify as one of the [[Hypsistarians]], an ancient Jewish-pagan sect of the [[Black Sea]] region who, in his understanding, sought to reverence, as being close to the Godhead, what came to their knowledge of the best and most perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Lletter to Boisserée dated 22 March 1831 quoted in Peter Boerner, ''Johann Wolfgang von Goethe 1832/1982: A Biographical Essay''. Bonn: Inter Nationes, 1981 p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe's unorthodox religious beliefs led him to be called "the great heathen" and provoked distrust among the authorities of his time, who opposed the creation of a Goethe monument on account of his offensive religious creed.&lt;ref name="Krimmer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krimmer |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Simpson |first2=Patricia Anne |title=Religion, Reason, and Culture in the Age of Goethe |date=2013 |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] considered Goethe "a heathen who converted to Islam."&lt;ref name="Krimmer" /&gt;

Politically, Goethe described himself as a "moderate [[liberalism|liberal]]", expressing sympathy for the liberalism of [[Pierre Étienne Louis Dumont|Étienne Dumont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Selth |first1=Jefferson P. |title=Firm Heart and Capacious Mind: The Life and Friends of Etienne Dumont |date=1997 |publisher=University Press of America |pages=132-133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mommsen |first1=Katharina |title=Goethe and the Poets of Arabia |date=2014 |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eckermann |first1=Johann Peter |title=Conversations with Goethe |date=1901 |publisher=M.W.

'Goethe: The Man and His Character'. p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe sympathized with the [[American Revolution]] and later wrote a poem in which he declared "America, you're better off than our continent, the old."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Unseld |first1=Siegfried |title=Goethe and His Publishers |date=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=36-37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gemünden |first1=Gerd |title=Framed Visions: Popular Culture, Americanization, and the Contemporary German and Austrian Imagination |date=1998 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=18-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not join in the anti-Napoleonic mood of 1812, and he distrusted the strident nationalism which started to be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Unseld |first1=Siegfried |title=Goethe and His Publishers |date=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medievalism of the Heidelberg Romantics was also repellent to Goethe's eighteenth-century ideal of a supra-national culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=David B. |title=Goethe's Search for the Muse: Translation and Creativity |date=1979 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe was a [[Freemason]], joining the lodge Amalia in Weimar in 1780, and frequently alluded to Masonic themes of universal brotherhood in his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beachy |first1=Robert |title=Recasting Cosmopolitanism: German Freemasonry and Regional Identity in the Early Nineteenth Century |journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies |date=2000 |volume=33 |issue=2 |page=266-274 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30053687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often requested to write poems arousing nationalist passions, Goethe would always decline. In old age, he explained why this was so to Eckermann:{{Quotation|How could I write songs of hatred when I felt no hate? And, between ourselves, I never hated the French, although I thanked God when we were rid of them. How could I, to whom the only significant things are civilization [''Kultur''] and barbarism, hate a nation which is among the most cultivated in the world, and to which I owe a great part of my own culture? In any case this business of hatred between nations is a curious thing. You will always find it more powerful and barbarous on the lowest levels of civilization. But there exists a level at which it wholly disappears, and where one stands, so to speak, above the nations, and feels the weal or woe of a neighboring people as though it were one's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10: Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&amp;Schuster|page=607|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Goethe had a great effect on the nineteenth century. In many respects, he was the originator of many ideas which later became widespread. He produced volumes of poetry, essays, criticism, a theory of [[optics|colours]] and early work on [[evolution]] and [[linguistics]]. He was fascinated by [[mineralogy]], and the mineral [[goethite]] ([[iron oxide]]) is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmineral.com/data/Goethite.shtml Webmineral.com]. Retrieved 21 August 2009,&lt;/ref&gt; His non-fiction writings, most of which are philosophic and [[aphoristic]] in nature, spurred the development of many thinkers, including [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Ernst Cassirer]], and [[Carl Gustav Jung|Carl Jung]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Along with [[Schiller]], he was one of the leading figures of [[Weimar Classicism]]. [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] cited Goethe's novel ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship'' as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'', ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise|La Nouvelle Héloïse]]'' and ''[[Don Quixote]]''.&lt;ref name="schopenhauer_art" /&gt;

Goethe embodied many of the contending strands in art over the next century: his work could be lushly emotional, and rigorously formal, brief and [[epigrammatic]], and epic. He would argue that [[Classicism]] was the means of controlling art, and that [[Romanticism]] was a sickness, even as he penned poetry rich in memorable images, and rewrote the formal rules of German poetry. His poetry was set to music by almost every major Austrian and German composer from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] to [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and his influence would spread to French drama and opera as well. [[Beethoven]] declared that a "Faust" Symphony would be the greatest thing for art. [[Liszt]] and [[Mahler]] both created symphonies in whole or in large part inspired by this [[Social influence|seminal]] work, which would give the 19th century one of its most paradigmatic figures: [[Faust|Doctor Faustus]].
[[File:Goetheanum Dornach.jpg|thumb|Second [[Goetheanum]]]] [[File:Mendelssohn plays to Goethe, 1830.jpg|thumb|Mendelssohn plays to Goethe, 1830: painting by [[Moritz Oppenheim]], 1864]]
The Faust tragedy/drama, often called ''{{lang|de|'''Das''' Drama der Deutschen}}'' ('''the''' drama of the Germans), written in two parts published decades apart, would stand as his most characteristic and famous artistic creation. Followers of the twentieth century [[esotericist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] built a theatre named the [[Goetheanum]] after him—where festival performances of [[Goethe's Faust|Faust]] are still performed.

Goethe was also a cultural force. During his first meeting with [[Napoleon]] in 1808, the latter famously remarked: "Vous étes un homme (You are a man)!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Friedenthal |first1=Richard |title=Goethe: His Life &amp; Times |date=2010 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two discussed politics, the writings of [[Voltaire]], and Goethe's ''Sorrows of Young Werther'', which Napoleon had read seven times and ranked among his favorites.&lt;ref name="Broers"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Broers |first1=Michael |title=Europe Under Napoleon |date=2014 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Swales |first1=Martin |title=Goethe: The Sorrows of Young Werther |date=1987 |publisher=CUP Archive |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe came away from the meeting deeply impressed with Napoleon's enlightened intellect and his efforts to build an alternative to the corrupt old regime.&lt;ref name="Broers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Merseburger |first1=Peter |title=Mythos Weimar: Zwischen Geist und Macht |date=2013 |publisher=Pantheon |pages=132-133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe always spoke of Napoleon with the greatest respect, confessing that "nothing higher and more pleasing could have happened to me in all my life" than to have met Napoleon in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferber |first1=Michael |title=A Companion to European Romanticism |date=2008 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=450}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Germaine de Staël]], in ''De L'Allemagne'' (1813), presented German Classicism and Romanticism as a potential source of spiritual authority for Europe, and identified Goethe as a living classic.&lt;ref name="RPF"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillespie |first1=Gerald Ernest Paul |last2=Engel |first2=Manfred |title=Romantic Prose Fiction |date=2008 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; She praised Goethe as possessing "the chief characteristics of the German genius" and uniting "all that distinguishes the German mind."&lt;ref name="RPF" /&gt; Staël's portrayal helped elevate Goethe over his more famous German contemporaries and transformed him into a European cultural hero.&lt;ref name="RPF" /&gt; Goethe met with her and her partner [[Benjamin Constant]], with whom he shared a mutual admiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=Dennis |title=Benjamin Constant: A Biography |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Victorian England, Goethe exerted a profound influence on [[George Eliot]], whose partner [[George Henry Lewes]] wrote a ''Life of Goethe''.&lt;ref name="Gerlinde"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Röder-Bolton |first1=Gerlinde |title=George Eliot and Goethe: An Elective Affinity |date=1998 |publisher=Rodopi |pages=3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot presented Goethe as "eminently the man who helps us to rise to a lofty point of observation" and praised his "large tolerance", which "quietly follows the stream of fact and of life" without passing moral judgments.&lt;ref name="Gerlinde" /&gt; [[Matthew Arnold]] found in Goethe the "Physician of the Iron Age" and "the clearest, the largest, the most helpful thinker of modern times" with a "large, liberal view of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Connell |first1=W.F. |title=The Educational Thought and Influence of Matthew Arnold |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goeothe Denkmal Leipzig.JPG|thumb|upright|Goethe memorial in front of the Alte Handelsbörse, Leipzig]]
It was to a considerable degree due to Goethe's reputation that the city of [[Weimar]] was chosen in 1919 as the venue for the [[Weimar National Assembly|national assembly]], convened to draft [[Weimar constitution|a new constitution]] for what would become known as Germany's [[Weimar Republic]]. Goethe became a key reference for [[Thomas Mann]] in his speeches and essays defending the republic.&lt;ref name="Mundt"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mundt |first1=Hannelore |title=Understanding Thomas Mann |date=2004 |publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press |pages=110-111}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized Goethe's "cultural and self-developing individualism", humanism, and cosmopolitanism.&lt;ref name="Mundt" /&gt;

The Federal Republic of Germany's cultural institution, the [[Goethe-Institut]] is named after him, and promotes the study of German abroad and fosters knowledge about Germany by providing information on its culture, society and politics.

The literary estate of Goethe in the Goethe and Schiller Archives was inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2001 in recognition of its historical significance.&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web|title=The literary estate of Goethe in the Goethe and Schiller Archives |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-literary-estate-of-goethe-in-the-goethe-and-schiller-archives|publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goethe's influence was dramatic because he understood that there was a transition in European sensibilities, an increasing focus on sense, the indescribable, and the emotional. This is not to say that he was emotionalistic or excessive; on the contrary, he lauded personal restraint and felt that excess was a disease: "There is nothing worse than imagination without taste". Goethe praised [[Francis Bacon]] for his advocacy of science based on experiment and his forceful revolution in thought as one of the greatest strides forward in modern science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Richter |first1=Simon J. |title=Goethe Yearbook 14 |date=2007 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=113-114}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was critical of Bacon's inductive method and approach based on pure classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Amrine |first1=F.R. |last2=Zucker |first2=Francis J. |title=Goethe and the Sciences: A Reappraisal |date=2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said in ''Scientific Studies'':

{{quote|We conceive of the individual animal as a small world, existing for its own sake, by its own means. Every creature is its own reason to be.

Viewed from within, no part of the animal is a useless or arbitrary product of the formative impulse (as so often thought). Externally, some parts may seem useless because the inner coherence of the animal nature has given them this form without regard to outer circumstance. Thus...[not] the question, What are they for? but rather, Where do they come from?&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Studies, Suhrkamp ed., vol. 12, p. 121; trans. Douglas Miller&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Goethe's scientific and aesthetic ideas have much in common with [[Denis Diderot]], whose work he translated and studied.&lt;ref name="Roach"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roach |first1=Joseph R. |title=The Player's Passion: Studies in the Science of Acting |date=1993 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |pages=165-166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fellows"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fellows |first1=Otis Edward |title=Diderot Studies |date=1981 |publisher=Librairie Droz |pages=392-394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Diderot and Goethe exhibited a repugnance towards the mathematical interpretation of nature; both perceived the universe as dynamic and in constant flux; both saw "art and science as compatible disciplines linked by common imaginative processes"; and both grasped "the unconscious impulses underlying mental creation in all forms."&lt;ref name="Roach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; Goethe's ''Naturanschauer'' is in many ways a sequel to Diderot's ''interprète de la nature''.&lt;ref name="Fellows" /&gt; 

His views make him, along with [[Adam Smith]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], a figure in two worlds: on the one hand, devoted to the sense of taste, order, and finely crafted detail, which is the hallmark of the artistic sense of the [[Age of Reason]] and the [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] period of [[architecture]]; on the other, seeking a personal, intuitive, and personalized form of expression and society, firmly supporting the idea of self-regulating and organic systems. George Henry Lewes celebrated Goethe's revolutionary understanding of the organism.&lt;ref name="Roach" /&gt;

Thinkers such as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] would take up many similar ideas in the 1800s. Goethe's ideas on [[evolution]] would frame the question that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]] would approach within the scientific paradigm. The Serbian inventor and electrical engineer [[Nikola Tesla]] was heavily influenced by [[Goethe's Faust]], his favorite poem, and had actually memorized the entire text. It was while reciting a certain verse that he was struck with the epiphany that would lead to the idea of the [[rotating magnetic field]] and ultimately, [[alternating current]].&lt;ref&gt;Seifer, Marc J.

The '''Kadam virus''' (or KAD, strain MP6640) is a [[tick]]-borne [[Flavivirus]].&lt;ref name=archive&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadam virus MP6640|url=http://www.european-virus-archive.com/Portal/produit.php?ref=110&amp;id_rubrique=1|publisher=www.european-virus-archive.com|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Located==
The virus was first isolated by the [[Uganda Virus Research Institute]] in [[Entebbe]], [[Uganda]] after samples were taken from cattle in Karamoja in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Henderson BE, Tukei PM, McCrae AW, Ssenkubuge Y, Mugo WN |title=Virus isolations from Ixodid ticks in Uganda.

==Spread==
Around the beginning of the 1980s the Kadam virus was found to be spread in Saudi Arabia by [[Hyalomma]] ticks&lt;ref name=Wood82/&gt;  when found on a dead camel at Wadi Thamamah in [[Riyadh]].

This is a '''list of [[Galliformes]] species by global population'''. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields. For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on [[population biology]] and [[population ecology]].

This list is not comprehensive, as not all Galliformes have had their numbers quantified.

[[Mount Kenya]] received its current name by European missionaries who, wrote the name as 'Kenya' from the Akamba word 'kiinyaa'. The first missionaries, Johann Ludwig Krapf, and Johannes Rebmann, were led into Kenyas interior by Akamba long distance traders. So when they asked the name of the mountain, they were given the name 'kiima kya kenia'. 'kenia' in Kamba means to glitter, or to shine, hence the Akamba people referred to it as the mountain that glitters, or the shining mountain. So these missionaries recorded it as Mt. Kenya, a Kamba word, and the country was then later named after this mountain.
Other ethnic groups living around the mountain such as the Agikuyu called this mountain 'Kirinyaga'; 'nyaga' in Kikuyu means white patches, hence it is also the Kikuyu word for Ostrich, and 'kiri' means with: so in essence they called it the mountain with ostriches. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]] call it ''Ol Donyo Eibor'' or ''Ol Donyo Egere'', which mean "the White mountain" or "the speckled mountain" respectively.&lt;ref name=thomson&gt;{{cite book

Others however say that this was on the contrary a very precise notation of a native word pronounced ''{{IPA|ˈkenia}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Nevertheless, the name was usually pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|iː|n|j|ə}} in English.&lt;ref name=oed_kenya&gt;{{OED|Kenya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that at the time this referred to the mountain without having to include ''mountain'' in the name. The current name ''Mount Kenya'' was used by some as early as 1894,&lt;ref name=gregory1894&gt;{{cite journal

He had previously assumed this name to reflect his commitment to freeing his country and his pronunciation of his name resulted in the pronunciation of Kenya in English changing back to an approximation of the original native pronunciation, the current ''{{IPA|ˈkɛnjə}}''.&lt;ref name=foottit/&gt; So the country was named after the colony, which in turn was named after the mountain as it is a very significant landmark.&lt;ref name=times_kenya_colony/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

[[File:Lenana maasai medicine man.jpeg|thumb|right|Lenana was the Chief Medicine-Man of the Maasai circa 1890. Pt Lenana was named after him by Halford Mackinder. Lenana was the son of Batian who was the previous Chief Medicine-Man.&lt;ref name=dutton/&gt;]]
The peaks of Mount Kenya have been given names from three different sources. Firstly, several Maasai chieftains have been commemorated, with names such as Batian, Nelion and Lenana. These names were suggested by Mackinder, on the suggestion of [[Sidney Langford Hinde]], who was the resident officer in Maasailand at the time of Mackinder's expedition. They commemorate Mbatian, a Maasai [[Rulers of the Masai|Laibon]] (Medicine Man), Nelieng, his brother, and Lenana and Sendeyo, his sons.&lt;ref name=dutton/&gt;  Terere is named after another Maasai headman.

The second type of names that were given to peaks are after climbers and explorers. Some examples of this are Shipton, Sommerfelt, Tilman, Dutton and Arthur. Shipton made the first ascent of Nelion, and Sommerfelt accompanied Shipton on the second ascent. Tilman made many first ascents of peaks with Shipton in 1930. Dutton and Arthur explored the mountain between 1910 and 1930. Arthur Firmin, who made many first ascents, has been remembered in Firmin's Col. [[Humphrey Slade]], of Pt Slade, explored the moorland areas of the mountain in the 1930s, and possibly made the first ascent of Sendeyo.&lt;ref name=mck/&gt;

The remaining names are after well-known Kenyan personalities, with the exception of John and Peter, which were named by the missionary Arthur after two [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]].

==Rivers==
Rivers starting above {{convert|3000|m|ft|-2}} are listed clockwise around the mountain from the north. Tributaries rivers which include the original name in their names are not listed, for example ''Liki North'' and ''Liki South''. The rivers on Mount Kenya have been named after the villages on the slopes of the mountain that they flow close to. The Thuchi River is the district boundary between Meru and Embu. Mount Kenya is a major water tower for the [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana]] river which in 1988 supplied 80% of [[Kenya|Kenya's]] electricity using a series of seven hydroelectric power stations and dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Below is the '''list of people whose names are used in chemical element names'''.  Of the [[chemical element|118 chemical elements]], 19 are connected with the names of 20 people.  15 elements were named to honor 16 scientists.  Four other elements have indirect connection to the names of non-scientists.  On top of this, a 21st person, a 17th scientist, has an implied connection to a 20th element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kevin A. Boudreaux|title=Derivations of the Names and Symbols of the Elements|url=http://www.angelo.edu/faculty/kboudrea/periodic/hist_names.htm|publisher=Angelo State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only [[gadolinium]] and [[samarium]] occur in nature (along with [[gallium]]). The rest are [[synthetic element|synthetic]].

==Table==
The following 19 elements are connected to the names of people.  [[Glenn T. Seaborg|Seaborg]] and [[Yuri Oganessian|Oganessian]] were the only two who were alive at the time of being honored with having elements named after them.  The four non-scientists in this table are connected with elements that were not named to honor the individual directly, but rather were named for a place or thing which in turn had been named for these people.  [[Samarium]] was named for the mineral [[samarskite]] from which it was isolated.  [[Americium]], [[berkelium]] and [[livermorium]] were named after places that had been named for them.  The cities of [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Livermore, California]] are the locations of the [[University of California Radiation Laboratory]] and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], respectively.

==Other connections==
Other element names have been proposed but failed to gain official international recognition.  These include columbium (Cb), hahnium (Ha), joliotium (Jl), and kurchatovium (Ku), names connected to [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Irène Joliot-Curie]], and [[Igor Kurchatov]] (more at the article on [[List of chemical elements naming controversies|element naming controversies]]).

Also, mythological entities have had a significant impact on the naming of elements.  [[Helium]], [[titanium]], [[selenium]], [[palladium]], [[promethium]], [[cerium]], [[europium]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[thorium]], [[uranium]], [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] are all given names connected to mythological deities.  With these five, that connection is indirect:
* helium: named for the Sun where it was discovered, being associated with the deity [[Helios]],
* Iridium: named for the Greek goddess Iris,
* tellurium: named for the Roman goddess of the earth, [[Tellus Mater]],
* niobium: named for [[Niobe]], a character of Greek mythology
* vanadium, named for [[Vanadís|Vanadis]], another name for Norse goddess [[Freyja]]
* selenium: named for the Moon being associated with the deity [[Selene]],
* palladium: named for the then-recently discovered asteroid [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] which had been named for the deity [[Pallas Athena]],
* cerium: named for the then-recently discovered asteroid [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] which had been named for the deity [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]],
* europium: named for the continent that had been named after the deity [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]].

Titanium is unique in the list above in that it refers to [[titan (mythology)|a group of deities]] rather than any particular individual.  So Helios, Selene, Pallas, and [[Prometheus]] actually have two elements named in their honor.

And for elements given a name connected with a group, there is also [[xenon]], named for the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''ξένον'' (xenon), neuter singular form of ''ξένος'' (xenos), meaning 'foreign(er)', 'strange(r)', or 'guest'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Its discoverer [[William Ramsay]] intended this name to be an indication of the qualities of this element in analogy to the generic group of people.

      <comment>/* Australian region */ given this source's blatant misuse of terms like "tsunami", and (more importantly perhaps) not specifying the type of winds (gusts? 1-minute? 10-minute?), this cannot stand.</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="72098">[[File:Tip 1979-10-12.jpg|right|thumb|Satellite image of [[Typhoon Tip]], which had the lowest [[atmospheric pressure]] measured in a tropical cyclone, at {{convert|870|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}]]
Tropical cyclone intensity is a complex topic. Winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas, and most popular [[tropical cyclone scales]] are organized around sustained wind speeds. However, variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make inter-comparison difficult. In addition, other impacts like rainfall, storm surge, area of wind damages, and tornadoes can vary significantly in storms with similar wind speeds. Pressure is often used to compare tropical cyclones because the measurements are easier to measure and are consistent. Tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on Earth. However, although there is a strong connection between lowered pressures and higher wind speeds, storms with the lowest pressures may not have the highest wind speeds, as each storm's relationship between wind and pressure is slightly different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kossin|first1=James|title=Hurricane Wind–Pressure Relationship and Eyewall Replacement Cycles|journal=Weather and Forecasting|date=February 2015|pages=177-181|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1175%2FWAF-D-14-00121.1|doi=10.1175/WAF-D-14-00121.1|bibcode=2015WtFor..30..177K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most recent and reliable records, most tropical cyclones which attained a pressure of 900&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|hPa]] ([[bar (unit)|mbar]]) (26.56&amp;nbsp;[[inch of mercury|inHg]]) or less occurred in the Western North [[Pacific Ocean]]. The strongest [[tropical cyclone]] recorded worldwide, as measured by minimum central [[pressure]], was [[Typhoon Tip]], which reached a pressure of 870&amp;nbsp;hPa (25.69&amp;nbsp;inHg) on October 12, 1979.&lt;ref name="jtwc"&gt;{{cite journal|volume=108|issue=11|pages=1915–1923|author=Dunnavan, George M|author2=Diercks, John W|date=November 1, 1980|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1980)108&lt;1915:AAOSTT&gt;2.0.CO;2|journal=Monthly Weather Review|accessdate=February 24, 2013|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493%281980%29108%3C1915%3AAAOSTT%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=An Analysis of Super Typhoon Tip (October 1979)|bibcode = 1980MWRv..108.1915D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following list is subdivided by [[Tropical cyclone basins|basins]].

The most intense storm in the North Atlantic by lowest pressure was [[Hurricane Wilma]]. The strongest storm by 1-minute sustained winds was [[Hurricane Allen]].

Storms which reached a minimum central pressure of {{convert|920|hPa|inHg|sigfig=4}} or less are listed. Storm information has been compiled back to 1851, though measurements were rarer until [[Hurricane hunters|aircraft reconnaissance]] started in the 1940s, and inexact estimates were still predominant until [[Dropsonde|dropsondes]] were implemented in the 1970s. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/rpibook-final04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Patricia 2015-10-23 1730Z (Worldview).jpg|thumb|[[Hurricane Patricia]] shortly after peak intensity, highest global sustained winds and lowest pressure in the Western Hemisphere]]

The most intense storm in the Eastern Pacific Ocean by both sustained winds and central pressure was [[Hurricane Patricia]]. Its sustained winds of 345&amp;nbsp;km/h (215&amp;nbsp;mph) are also the highest on record globally.

Storms with a minimum central pressure of 925&amp;nbsp;hPa (27.32&amp;nbsp;inHg) or less are listed. Storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1949, and most storms since are only estimated because landfalls (and related reconnaissance) are less common in this basin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/best_tracks/TC_bt_report.html|title=ATCR report plan|website=www.usno.navy.mil|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 16 cyclones are listed down below reaching/surpassing that intensity, which most of them occurred during [[El Niño]] seasons. Tropical cyclones that have been recorded since the start of the 1969–70 Tropical Cyclone year and have reached their peak intensity to the west of 160E are included in the list. The most intense tropical cyclone in the south Pacific, [[Cyclone Winston]] of 2016, is also the most intense storm in the Southern Hemisphere.

Storms with an intensity of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg) or less are listed.  Storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1985.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==South Atlantic Ocean==
{{main|South Atlantic tropical cyclone}}
[[Image:Cyclone Catarina 2004.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Hurricane Catarina]] near peak intensity]]
Until recently, it was not known that tropical cyclones could exist in the southern Atlantic.  However, [[Hurricane Catarina]] in 2004, to date the only hurricane in the south Atlantic, brought additional review.  A subsequent study found that there was an average of 1-2 subtropical or tropical cyclones per year in the Southern Atlantic in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author2=Braun, Aviva J|publisher=American Meteorological Society|year=2012|pages=7328–7340|title=A Climatology of Subtropical Cyclones in the South Atlantic|doi=10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00212.1|journal=Journal of Climate|volume=25|author1=Evans, Jenny L|bibcode=2012JCli...25.7328E}}&lt;/ref&gt;
No official database of South Atlantic cyclones exists, but a partial list of tropical and subtropical systems with intensity below 1000&amp;nbsp;hPa (29.53&amp;nbsp;inHg) is listed.

This is a '''list of notable [[waterfall]]s''' of the world sorted by continent, then country, then province, state or territory. A waterfall is considered ''notable'' if it has an existing article specifically for it on Wikipedia, and the height or width is a minimum of {{convert|15|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, or the falls have some historical significance based on multiple reliable references.

{{ambox|issue=
'' '''Note''':  There is no standard way to measure the height or width of a waterfall. '''No ranking of waterfalls should be assumed because of the heights or widths provided in the list.''' Many numbers are estimated and measurements may be imprecise.''

'''Magneto-inertial fusion''' (MIF) describes a class of [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] devices which combine aspects of [[magnetic confinement fusion]] and [[inertial confinement fusion]] in an attempt to lower the cost of fusion devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.gaianxaos.com/pdf/physics/magnetized_target_fusion.pdf|title=Why Magnetized Target Fusion Offers a Low-Cost Development Path For Fusion Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIF uses magnetic fields to confine an initial warm, low-density [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], then compresses that [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] to fusion conditions using an impulsive driver or "liner."

Magneto-inertial fusion approaches differ in the degree of magnetic organization present in the initial target, as well as the nature and speed of the imploding liner. Laser, solid,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://fusionenergy.lanl.gov/Documents/FRX-L-MachinePaper-RSI-July2003.pdf|title=FRX-L: A Field-Reversed Configuration Plasma Injector For Magnetized Target Fusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; liquid and plasma&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/plasmajet-driven-magnetoinertial-fusion-pjmif/|title=Plasma-Jet Driven Magneto-Inertial Fusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; liners have all been proposed.

Magneto-inertial fusion begins with a warm dense plasma target containing a [[magnetic field]]. Plasma's [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] prevents it from crossing magnetic field lines. As a result, compressing the target amplifies the magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/112/4/042084/pdf/1742-6596_112_4_042084.pdf|title=Status of the US program in magneto-inertial fusion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=F. J.|last1=Wessel|first2=F. S.|last2=Felber|first3=N. C.|last3=Wild|first4=H. U.|last4=Rahman|title=Generation of high magnetic fields using a gas‐puff Z pinch|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1059071|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=1986-04-28|issn=0003-6951|pages=1119–1121|volume=48|issue=17|doi=10.1063/1.96616|first5=A.|last5=Fisher|first6=E.|last6=Ruden|bibcode=1986ApPhL..48.1119W}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;H. U. Rahman, F. J. Wessel,  and N. Rostoker, Staged Z-pinch. Physical Review Letters 74 (1995), 714.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the magnetic field reduces particle transport, the field insulates the target from the liner.

== In popular fiction ==
The starships in Mike Kupari's novel ''Her Brother's Keeper'' are propelled in part by magneto-inertial fusion rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kupari |first=Mike |year=2015 |title=Her Brother's Keeper |location=Riverdale, New York |publisher=Baen Books |page=40 |isbn=978-1-4767-8090-0 |oclc=920469663 |url=http://www.baenebooks.com/p-2848-her-brothers-keeper.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Last winter I made several attempts to model the surface which he suggests, in which the three coordinates are volume, entropy and energy. The numerical data about entropy can only be obtained by integration from data which are for most bodies very insufficient, and besides it would require a very unwieldy model to get all the features, say of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, well represented, so I made no attempt at accuracy, but modelled a fictitious substance, in which the volume is greater when solid than when liquid; and in which, as in water, the saturated vapour becomes superheated by compression. When I had at last got a plaster cast I drew on it lines of equal pressure and temperature, so as to get a rough motion of their forms. This I did by placing the model in sunlight, and tracing the curve when the rays just grazed the surface... I send you a sketch of these lines..."

(letter to [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], 8 July, 1875)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of the model ==
Gibbs' papers defined what Gibbs called the "thermodynamic surface," which expressed the relationship between the volume, entropy, and energy of a substance at different temperatures and pressures. However, Gibbs did not include any diagrams of this surface.&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iowa"&gt;[http://www.eng.iastate.edu/coe/feature/jolls.asp Iowa State Chemical Engineer Drives Issue of New Stamp Honoring Father of Thermodynamics: Iowa State University – College of Engineering, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030193200/http://www.eng.iastate.edu/coe/feature/jolls.asp |date=2012-10-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving reprints of Gibbs' papers, Maxwell recognized the insight afforded by Gibbs' new point of view and set about constructing physical three-dimensional models of the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Garber, Brush, and Everitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hA-oIDR0eXkC&amp;pg=PA49 p. 49].&lt;/ref&gt; This reflected Maxwell's talent as a strong visual thinker&lt;ref&gt;Ken Brodlie, "Scientific visualization — past, present and future," Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Neutron Scattering Data Analysis, ''Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment'', Volume 354, Issue 1, 15 January 1995, Pages 104-111, {{doi|10.1016/0168-9002(94)01031-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and prefigured modern [[scientific visualization]] techniques.&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt;

Maxwell sculpted the original model in clay and made three [[plaster cast]]s of the clay model, sending one to Gibbs as a gift, keeping the other two in his laboratory at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt; Maxwell's copy is on display at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] of Cambridge University,&lt;ref name="siggraph"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Museum at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]: [http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/museum/area1/cabinet1.htm Maxwell's Apparatus].&lt;/ref&gt; while Gibbs' copy is on display at the Sloane Physics Laboratory of [[Yale University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth R. Jolls |chapter=Gibbs and the art of thermodynamics |title=Proceedings of the Gibbs Symposium, Yale University, May 15–17, 1989 |page=321 |editor=D. G. Caldi |editor2=George D. Mostow |publisher= American Mathematical Society |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-8218-0157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Gibbs held a professorship. A number of historic photographs were taken of these plaster casts during the middle of the twentieth century – including one by James Pickands II, published in 1942&lt;ref name="Rukeyser"/&gt; – and these photographs exposed a wider range of people to Maxwell's visualization approach.

== Uses of the model ==
[[File:Maxwell's letters plate IV.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maxwell's sketch of the isothermals and isopiestics on his surface (Plate IV of his collected letters).]]

Maxwell drew lines of equal pressure (isopiestics) and of equal temperature (isothermals) on his plaster cast by placing it in the sunlight, and "tracing the curve when the rays just grazed the surface."&lt;ref name="onheat"/&gt; He sent sketches of these lines to a number of colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Garber, Brush, and Everitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hA-oIDR0eXkC&amp;pg=PA50 pp. 50].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, his letter to [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]] of 15 July 1875 included sketches of these lines.&lt;ref name="onheat"/&gt; Maxwell provided a more detailed explanation and a clearer drawing of the lines in the revised version of his book ''Theory of Heat'',&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell]], ''[https://archive.org/details/theoryofheat00maxwrich Theory of Heat]'', revised in 1891 by [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh]]: the drawing of the lines appears as Figure 26d on page 207.&lt;/ref&gt; and a version of this drawing appeared on a 2005 US postage stamp in honour of Gibbs.&lt;ref name="Iowa"/&gt;

As well as being on display in two countries, Maxwell's model lives on in the literature of thermodynamics, and books on the subject often mention it,&lt;ref name="mt"&gt;See, for example, Don S. Lemons, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WFZf2G80tNcC&amp;pg=PA146 Mere Thermodynamics]'', Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-8018-9015-2}}, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; though not always with complete historical accuracy. For example, the thermodynamic surface represented by the sculpture is often reported to be that of water,&lt;ref name="mt"/&gt; contrary to Maxwell's own statement.&lt;ref name="onheat"/&gt;

== Related models ==
Maxwell's model was not the first plaster model of a thermodynamic surface: in 1871, even before Gibbs' papers, [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] had constructed a plaster [[pressure]]-[[volume]]-[[temperature]] plot, based on data for [[carbon dioxide]] collected by [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anneke Levelt Sengers|Johanna Levelt Sengers]], ''[http://www.knaw.nl/waals/pdf/fluids_complete.pdf How Fluids Unmix: Discoveries by the School of Van der Waals and Kamerlingh Onnes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530063315/http://www.knaw.nl/waals/pdf/fluids_complete.pdf |date=2007-05-30 }}'', [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]], 2002, pp. 56 &amp; 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1900, the Dutch scientist [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], together with his student [[Johannes Petrus Kuenen]] and his assistant Zaalberg van Zelst, continued Maxwell's work by constructing their own plaster thermodynamic surface models.&lt;ref name="knaw"&gt;See the page [http://www.knaw.nl/waals/experiments_kamerlingh.html 3D-Models/Mixtures/Experiments: Kamerlingh Onnes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210065914/http://www.knaw.nl/waals/experiments_kamerlingh.html |date=2004-12-10 }} from the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. Some of these models are on display at the [[Museum Boerhaave]]: [http://www.museumboerhaave.nl/AAcollection/english/M21V01.html Room 21] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607145133/http://www.museumboerhaave.nl/AAcollection/english/M21V01.html |date=2011-06-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; These models were based on accurate experimental data obtained in their laboratory, and were accompanied by specialised tools for drawing the lines of equal pressure.&lt;ref name="knaw"/&gt;

'''Mormo''' ({{Lang-el|Μορμώ, Μορμών}}, ''Mormō'') was a female [[spirit]] in Greek [[folklore]], whose name was invoked by mothers and [[nanny|nurses]] to frighten children to keep them from misbehaving.

The term '''mormolyce''' {{IPAc-en|m|ɔr|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ᵻ|ˌ|s|iː}} ({{lang|el|μορμολύκη}}; pl. ''mormolykeia'' {{lang|el|μορμολύκεια}}), also spelt '''mormolyceum''' {{IPAc-en|m|ɔr|ˌ|m|ɒ|l|ᵻ|ˈ|s|iː|ə|m}} ({{lang|el|μορμολυκεῖον}} ''mormolukeîon''), is considered equivalent.

==Etymology==
The name ''mormo'' has the plural form ''mormones'' which means "fearful ones" or "hideous one(s)", and is related to an array of words that signify "fright".&lt;ref name=johnston/&gt;{{sfnp|Stannish|Doran|2013|p=118}} 

The variant ''mormolyce'' translates to "terrible wolves", with the stem ''-lykeios'' meaning "of a wolf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Phasma/Empousai.html |title=Lamia &amp; Empusa (empousa) |website=theoi |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Stannish|Doran|2013|p=118}}

==Description==
The original Mormo was a woman of [[Corinth]], who ate her children then flew out; according to an account only attested in a single source.{{Refn|Scholios to [[Aristides]] (Dindorf, p. 41)&lt;ref name=johnston/&gt;}} '''Mormolyca''' {{IPAc-en|m|ɔr|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ᵻ|k|ə}} (as the name appears in [[Doric Greek]]: {{lang|el|μορμολύκα}}) is designated as the [[wetnurse]] ({{lang-el|τιθήνη}}) of [[Acheron]] by Sophron ({{floruit}} 430 BC).{{Refn|Sophron frag. 9, ed. Kaibel.&lt;ref name=johnston-AMRP/&gt;}}

Mormo or Moromolyce has been described as a female specter, phantom, or ghost by modern commentators.&lt;ref name=dict-grbm/&gt;&lt;ref name=dict-grbm-mormolyce/&gt;{{sfnp|Stannish|Doran|2013|p=28}} A mormolyce is one of several names given to the female ''phasma'' (phantom) in [[Philostratus]]'s ''Life of Apollonius of Tyana''.{{Refn|An ''empousa'', or ''lamia'', she is also called in the work.}}&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus, ''Life of Apollonius'' 4.25, quoted by {{harvp|Ogden|2013a|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormo is glossed as equivalent to [[Lamia]] and ''mormolykeion'', considered to be frightening beings, in the ''[[Suda]]'', a lexicon of the Byzantine Periods.&lt;ref name=suda-mormo&gt;"{{plain link|name=Mormo |url=http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/mu/1212}}", ''Suda On Line", tr. Richard Rodriguez. 11 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Mombro''' ({{lang|el|Μομβρώ}}) or Mormo are a [[bugbear]] ({{lang|el|φόβητρον}}), the ''Suda'' also says.&lt;ref name=suda-mobro&gt;"{{plain link|name=Mombro |url=http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/mu/1212}}", ''Suda On Line", tr.  David Whitehead. 27 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mormo" and "[[Gello]]" were also [[aliases]] for Lamia according to one scholiast, who also claimed she was queen of the [[Laestrygonians]], the race of man-eating giants.{{Refn|name=scholios-theocritus|Scholios to Theocritus ''Idylls'' 15.40.{{sfnp|Ogden|2013b|p=98}}&lt;ref name=johnston/&gt;}}

===Bugbear===
The name of "Mormo" or the synonymous "Mormolyceion" was used by the Greeks as a [[bugbear]] or [[bogeyman|bogey]] word to frighten children.&lt;ref name=dict-grbm/&gt;&lt;ref name=dict-grbm-mormolyce/&gt;

Some of its instances are found in [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes. ''Archanians'', 582ff. "Your terrifying armor makes me dizzy. I beg you, take away that Mormo (bogey-monster)!"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes. ''Peace'', 474ff. "This is terrible! You are in the way, sitting there. We have no use for your Mormo's (bogy-like) head, friend."&lt;/ref&gt; Mormo as an object of fear for infants was even recorded in the ''[[Alexiad]]'' written by a Byzantine princess around the [[First Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Anna Comnena |others=Sewter, Edgar Robert Ashton (tr.) |title=The Alexiad of Anna Comnena |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1969 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2sbAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Mormo |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern interpretations===
A mormo or a lamia may also be associated with the [[empusa]], a phantom sent by the goddess [[Hecate|Hekate]].{{sfnp|Fontenrose|1959|pp=116–117}}

==Popular entertainment==
* ''[[The Horror at Red Hook]]'' by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (1925), describes an inscription to [[Hecate]], [[Gorgon|Gorgo]], and Mormo, found in the raid of Red Hook.

* According to [[Anton LaVey]], in ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', Mormo is the "King of the [[Ghoul]]s, [[:wikt:consort|consort]] of [[Hecate]]".

* Mormo is an evil witch in the [[Stardust (2007 film)|2007 film adaptation]] of the [[Neil Gaiman]] novel ''[[Stardust (novel)|Stardust]]''.{{Efn|Mormo lives with two sisters, Lamia and Empusa in the film.}}

* Mormo is a flying sentient cat in the ''[[Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology]]'' video game.

*In the film ''[[The God Makers]]'' [[Ed Decker]] claims [[Mormons]] are followers of Mormo.

*''Warraguk, a Flying Mormo'' is a dance suite composed by James Cuomo in the late 1960s, based on concepts from [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]].{{Efn|Cuomo later named his band Mormos.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14412">The neural basis of [[self]] is the idea of using modern concepts of [[neuroscience]] to describe and understand the [[biological]] processes that underlie human's [[perception]] of self-understanding. The '''neural basis of self''' is closely related to the [[psychology of self]] with a deeper foundation in [[neurobiology]].

==Experimental techniques==
In order to understand how the human [[mind]] makes the [[human]] [[perception]] of [[self]], there are different experimental techniques. One of the more common methods of determining brain areas that pertain to different [[mental processes]] is by using [[Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]]. [[fMRI]] data is often used to determine activation levels in portions of the brain. fMRI measures blood flow in the brain. Areas with higher blood flow as shown on fMRI scans are said to be activated. This is due to the assumption that portions of the brain receiving increased blood flow are being used more heavily during the moment of scanning.&lt;ref&gt;About Functional MRI.  {{cite web |url=http://www.fmri.org/fmri.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109170511/http://www.fmri.org/fmri.htm |archivedate=2012-01-09 |df= }}. Accessed November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Positron emission tomography]] is another method used to study brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;Damasio AR, Grabowski TJ, Bechara A, et al. Subcortical and cortical brain activity during the feeling of self-generated emotions. Nature Neuroscience. 2000;3(10):1049-1056.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-awareness==

===Anatomy===

[[File:Head image.jpg|thumb|right|Brain areas involved human perception of self.]]
Two areas of the [[brain]] that are important in retrieving [[self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] are the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] and the medial posterior parietal cortex.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer"&gt;Pfeifer, J. H., Lieberman, M. D., &amp; Dapretto, M. (2007). "I know you are but what am I?!": Neural bases of self- and social knowledge retrieval in children and adults. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19(8), 1323-1337.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[posterior cingulate cortex]], the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and [[medial prefrontal cortex]] are thought to combine to provide humans with the ability to self-reflect. The [[insular cortex]] is also thought to be involved in the process of [[self-reference]].&lt;ref name="Modinos"&gt;Modinos G, Renken R, Ormel J, Aleman A. Self-reflection and the psychosis-prone brain: an fMRI study. Neuropsychology [serial online]. May 2011;25(3):295-305. Available from: MEDLINE with Full Text, Ipswich, MA. Accessed November 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodiment===
The sense of embodiment is critical to a person’s conception of [[self]]. Embodiment is the understanding of the physical body and its relation to oneself.&lt;ref name="Arzy"&gt;Arzy, S., Thut, G., Mohr, C., Michel, C. M., &amp; Blanke, O. (2006). Neural basis of embodiment: Distinct contributions of temporoparietal junction and extrastriate body area. Journal of Neuroscience, 26(31), 8074-8081.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of human embodiment currently has a large impact on the study of human [[cognition]] as a whole. The current study of embodiment suggests that sensory input and [[experiences]] impact human’s overall [[perception]]. This idea somewhat challenges previous ideas of human [[cognition]] because it challenges the idea of the human mind being innate.&lt;ref&gt;Pezzulo G, Barsalou LW, Cangelosi A, Fischer MH, McRae K, Spivey MJ. The mechanics of embodiment: a dialog on embodiment and computational modeling. Frontiers In Psychology.2:5-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two portions of the [[brain]] that have recently been found to have a large importance on a person’s perception of [[self]]. The [[temporoparietal junction]], located in the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] is one of these brain regions. The [[temporoparietal junction]] is thought to integrate [[sensory information]]. The second portion of the brain thought to be involved in perception of embodiment is the [[extrastriate body area]]. The extrastriate body area is located in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex.  When people are shown images of body parts, the [[extrastriate body area]] is activated. The temporoparietal junction is involved in sensory integration processes while the extrastriate body area deals mainly with [[thoughts]] of and exposure to human body parts. It has been found that the brain responds to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] that involve embodiment differently from stimuli that involve [[locatization (disambiguatino)|localization]]. During task performance tests, a person’s [[body position]] (whether he or she is sitting or laying face up) affects how the extrastriate body area is activated. The temporoparietal junction, however, is not affected by a person’s particular body position. The temporoparietal junction deals with disembodied rather than embodied self-location, explaining why a person’s physical position does not affect its activation. Self-location as related to a person’s sense of embodiment is related to his or her actual location in space.&lt;ref name="Arzy" /&gt;

===Autobiographical memories===
The [[information]] people remember as [[autobiographical memory]] is essential to their perception of self. These [[memories]] form the way people feel about themselves. The left [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] and [[posterior cingulate cortex]] are involved in the memory of autobiographical information.&lt;ref&gt;Botzung, A., Denkova, E., Ciuciu, P., Scheiber, C., &amp; Manning, L. (2008). The neural bases of the constructive nature of autobiographical memories studied with a self-paced [[fMRI]] design. Memory, 16(4), 351-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morality===
[[Morality]] is an extremely important defining factor for humans. It often defines or contributes to people’s choices or actions, defining who a person is. Making moral decisions, much like other neural processes has a clear biological basis. The anterior and [[medial prefrontal cortex]] and the superior temporal sulcus are activated when people feel [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[compassion]], or [[embarrassment]]. Guilt and [[Passion (emotion)|passion]] activate the [[mesolimbic pathway]], and indignation and disgust are activated by the amygdala. There is clearly a network involved with the ideas of [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;Moll, J., de Oliveira-Souza, R., Garrido, G. J., Bramati, I. E., Caparelli-Daquer, E. M. A., Paiva, M., et al. (2007). The self as a moral agent: Link-ling the neural bases of social agency and moral sensitivity. Social Neuroscience, 2(3-4), 336-352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of self==
In order to explain how a human views him or herself, two different conceptual views of self-perception exist: the individualist and collectivistic views of [[self]]. The individualistic view of self involves people's perception of themselves as a stand-alone [[individual]]. This is thought of as a somewhat permanent perception of oneself that is unaffected by environmental and temporary cues and influences. People who view themselves in an individualistic sense describe themselves with [[personality traits]] that are permanent descriptions unrelated to particular situations. The collectivistic view of self, however, involves people's perception of themselves as members of a group or in a particular situation. The view people have of themselves in a collectivistic sense is entirely dependent on the situation they are in and the group with which they are interacting. These two ideas of self are also called self-construal styles.&lt;ref name="Chiao"&gt;Chiao, J. Y., Harada, T., Komeda, H., Li, Z., Mano, Y., Saito, D., et al. (2009). Neural Basis of Individualistic and Collectivistic Views of Self. Human Brain Mapping, 30(9), 2813-2820.&lt;/ref&gt;
There is neurobiological evidence supporting these two definitions of self-construal styles.  [[fMRI]] data has been used to understand the [[biology]] of both the individualistic and collectivistic view of self. Certain people tend to view themselves in almost exclusively a collectivistic sense or an individualistic sense. When people have to describe themselves in a collectivistic way (as a part of a group), those who tend to view themselves collectivistically show greater [[fMRI]] activation in the medial prefrontal  cortex than those who view themselves individualistically. The reverse is true when people describe themselves individualistically.&lt;ref name="Chiao" /&gt;

==Impaired views of self==

The study of the human [[mind]] in diseased states provides valuable insight into how the mind works in healthy individuals. A multitude of diseases are studied to understand altered perceptions of self and what causes these impairments.

===Autism===
[[Autism]] is a disorder in which those affected experience impaired social interactions, communication, and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Carayol J, Schellenberg GD, Dombroski B, Genin E, Rousseau F, Dawson G. Autism risk assessment in siblings of affected children using sex-specific genetic scores. Molecular Autism.2(1):17-17.&lt;/ref&gt; A new approach to studying [[autism]] is to focus on individuals’ perception of [[self]] rather than understanding the individual’s social interactions. A common thought is that understanding of the differences between the self and others are impaired. However, the exact biological mechanism of self-understanding in autistic children is currently unknown. It has been found that there are significant differences in brain activation in self and other situations in autistic children when compared to children who do not have autism.  
In adults who do not have autism, during [[self-recognition]] tasks, the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule in the right hemisphere are activated. Children who do not have autism show activation in these areas when performing face processing tasks for their own faces and those of others. Children with autism, however, only show activation in these areas when recognizing their own faces. The activation in the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] is less in children with autism than in those who do not have autism.&lt;ref&gt;Uddin, L. Q., Davies, M. S., Scott, A. A., Zaidel, E., Bookheimer, S. Y., Iacoboni, M., et al. (2008). Neural Basis of Self and Other Representation in Autism: An fMRI Study of Self-Face Recognition. PLoS ONE, 3(10).
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schizophrenia===
The cortical midline structure is extremely important in the understanding of the self, especially during the task of self-reflection. Many researchers believe that self-reference plays a role in the expression of [[psychoses]]. The disturbance of the individual’s self may be underlying the manifestation of these psychoses. Occurrences such as [[hallucinations]] and [[delusions]] may originate with disruptions of a person’s perception of the self. Understanding the differences in those who have [[psychoses]] and those who do not can aid in diagnoses and treatment of those diseases. Those who are prone to psychoses such as [[schizophrenia]], when describing positive traits about themselves show increased activation in the left insula, right dorsomedial [[prefrontal cortex]], and left [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]]. When they use negative traits to describe themselves, those who are prone to psychoses show higher activation in the bilateral insula, [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name="Modinos" /&gt;

===After strokes===

Sometimes after strokes patients' perception of self changes. Often after a stroke, patients report their perception of self in more negative terms than before their stroke.
&lt;ref&gt;Ellis-Hill CS, Horn S. Change in identity and self-concept: a new theoretical approach to recovery following a stroke. Clinical Rehabilitation. 2000;14(3):279-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging==
It has been found that humans’ ideas of themselves are established early in life but that the perception can change as others ideas are combined with their own. 
There are differences in the areas activated during self-knowledge retrieval between adults and children. This suggests a difference in self-knowledge neurobiologically due to normal aging. The [[prefrontal cortex]] and the medial posterior parietal cortex have been found to be activated when adults perform self-knowledge retrieval processes. Tests consist of presenting subjects with self-description phrases and allowing the subject to respond yes or no depending on whether or not the phrase describes him or herself. During this task, patients brains are fMRI scanned. These results can then be compared to [[fMRI]] data of the same patients when they are asked if the same phrases describe another individual, such as a well-known fictional character. The [[medial prefrontal cortex]] is activated more strongly for subjects when they are describing themselves than when they are describing others. However, children show greater medial prefrontal cortex activation than adults when performing self-knowledge retrieval tasks. Additionally, children and adults activate different specific regions in the medial prefrontal cortex. Adults activate the posterior [[precuneus]] more while children activate the anterior precuneus and the posterior cingulate.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer" /&gt;
The understanding of the areas of the brain most frequently activated in children and adults can also provide information about how children, adolescents, and adults view themselves differently. Older children more significantly activate the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] because they deal with [[introspection]] much less frequently than adults and adolescents. Children have decreased specificity in skills than adults, so they show greater activation during spatial tasks. This is explained by the idea that with increased expertise in a task, decreased interest in wide spatial parameters occurs. When a person is an expert, he or she is able to be more focused in his or her performance. The difference in performance between adults and children is thought to be attributable to different perceptions of the self whether it is more introspective or more concerned with the surroundings and environment.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer" /&gt;

'''''Operating Manual For Spaceship Earth''''' is a short book by [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], first published in 1968, following an address with a similar title given to the 50th annual convention of the American Planners Association in the Shoreham Hotel, Washington D.C., on 16 October 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/operating-manual-for-spaceship-earth/oclc/5304/editions?start_edition=1&amp;sd=asc&amp;se=yr&amp;referer=di&amp;qt=sort_yr_asc&amp;editionsView=true&amp;fq= WorldCat list of editions] including 1967 speech and 1968 Carbondale Southern Illinois University Press edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The book relates Earth to a spaceship flying through space. The spaceship has a finite amount of resources and cannot be resupplied.

==Chapter synopsis==

===Comprehensive propensities===
Describes how people perceive his prognostications, and the conclusion that fairly reasonable forecasts can be made of approx 25 years.

The idea that specialization is society's vehicle, but perhaps unnatural.

The concept of the [[Great Pirate]] also emerges as the first peoples to undertake sea vessels and first sea traders.

===Origins of specialization===
The ''Great Pirate'' concept is explained in depth, and the source of their power is that they are the ''only'' masters of ''global'' information in a time where people are focused locally. Specifically, the ''Great Pirates'' are aware that resources are not evenly distributed around the world, so that items which are abundant in one area are scarce in another. This gives rise to trade which the ''Great Pirates'' exploit for their own advantage.

Power struggles for waterways ensue, requiring people like [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]] to design better defenses for the ''Great Pirates''. The Pirates establish governments in various areas and support leaders who will defend their trade routes.

As engineers become involved with the ''Great Pirates'' many new concepts appear, but the main one was of the Navy. As the size of the people in the ''Great Pirates''' employment grow, training becomes a necessity, and the beginnings of schools and colleges ensue.  Monarchs are encouraged to develop civil service systems to provide secure but ''specialized'' employment for their brightest subjects, which prevents them from competing with the ''Great Pirates'' in their lucrative global trading.  Thus the ''Great Pirates'' guarded the advantages that their unique global perspective revealed.

===Comprehensively commanded automation===
[[World War I]] emerges as the struggle between the 'out-pirates' (electronic and chemical warfare) and the 'in-pirates' (electromagnetics). This change from the visible to the invisible forced the ''Great Pirates'' to rely on experts, which causes the end of the ''Great Pirates'' (who previously had been the only ones that were truly multi-disciplined).

The public is unaware that ''Great Pirates'' have been ruling the earth, and the role falls back to kings and politicians, though the frameworks of trade, rating and accounting remain.

===Spaceship earth===
This chapter sets up the idea that the earth is a spaceship, with the sun as our energy supplier. "We are all astronauts" says Fuller.

The idea of the earth is as a mechanical vehicle that requires maintenance, and that if you do not keep it in good order it will cease to function.

===General systems theory===
Likens humanity to a chick that has just broken out of its shell and is now ready to enter the next phase of its existence.  Suggests "How big can we think?"

===Synergy===
Where the whole of a system is greater than the sum of its parts.  "Ergo, only complete world desovereignization can permit the realization of an all humanity high standard support."

===Integral functions===
Wealth is expanded by the development of tools which go beyond what was integral to man.   The highest priority need of world society is a realistic accounting system, instead of one where a top toolmaker in India gets paid in a month what he would make in a day in Detroit.

===The regenerative landscape===
Defines tools as either craft tools that can be invented by one man, such as bows and arrows, and industrial tools that can not be produced by one man, such as the S.S. ''Queen Mary''.  Finds language to be the first industrial tool.  States that craft tools were used to create industrial tools.  States that to take advantage of potential wealth we must give life fellowships to each person who is or becomes unemployed, and states that for every 100,000 fellowships given out one person will come up with something so valuable that it will pay for the remaining 99,999 fellowships.  Predicts that soon the great office buildings will be turned into residences and that all the work that had been done in them will be done in the basements of a few buildings.  States that we "must operate exclusively on our vast daily energy income from the powers of wind, tide, water, and the direct Sun radiation energy".
::
Ends with anecdotal comments about his travels using three watches to keep track of time, at the office, where he is, and where he is going next, and an admonition "So, planners, architects, and engineers take the initiative".

A '''pathovar''' is a [[bacteria]]l strain or set of strains with the same or similar characteristics, that is differentiated at infrasubspecific level from other strains of the same species or subspecies on the basis of distinctive pathogenicity to one or more [[plant]] hosts.

Pathovars are named as a ternary or quaternary addition to the species binomial name, for example the bacterium that causes [[citrus canker]] ''Xanthomonas axonopodis'', has several pathovars with different host ranges,  ''X. axonopodis'' pv. ''citri'' is one of them; the abbreviation 'pv.' means pathovar.

The [[type (biology)|type]] strains of pathovars are '''pathotypes''', which are distinguished from the types (holotype, neotype, etc.) of the species to which the pathovar belongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.isppweb.org/about_tppb_naming.asp |title=International Standards for Naming Pathovars of Phytopathogenic Bacteria |author1=J.M.

[[Carbon nanotubes]] (CNTs) are cylinders of one or more layers of [[graphene]] (lattice). Diameters of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are typically 0.8 to 2&amp;nbsp;nm and 5 to 20&amp;nbsp;nm, respectively, although MWNT diameters can exceed 100&amp;nbsp;nm. CNT lengths range from less than 100&amp;nbsp;nm to 0.5 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/nn401995z| pmid = 23806050| title = Growth of Half-Meter Long Carbon Nanotubes Based on Schulz–Flory Distribution| journal = ACS Nano |volume = 7| issue = 7| pages = 6156–61| year = 2013| last1 = Zhang | first1 = R. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Y. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = Q. | last4 = Xie | first4 = H. | last5 = Qian | first5 = W. | last6 = Wei | first6 = F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual CNT walls can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the orientation of the lattice with respect to the tube axis, which is called [[chirality]]. MWNT's cross-sectional area offers an elastic modulus approaching 1 TPa and a tensile strength of 100 GPa, over 10-fold higher than any industrial fiber. MWNTs are typically metallic and can carry currents of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; A cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. SWNTs can display [[thermal conductivity]] of 3500 W m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, exceeding that of [[diamond]].&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

{{As of|2013}}, [[carbon nanotube]] production exceeded several thousand tons per year, used for applications in energy storage, device modelling, automotive parts, boat hulls, sporting goods, water filters, thin-film electronics, coatings, actuators and electromagnetic shields.

Recently, several studies have highlighted the prospect of using carbon nanotubes as building blocks to fabricate three-dimensional macroscopic (&gt;1mm in all three dimensions) all-carbon devices.

CNTs exhibit dimensional and chemical compatibility with biomolecules, such as [[DNA]] and [[protein]]s. CNTs enable fluorescent and photoacoustic imaging, as well as localized heating using near-infrared radiation.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

SWNT biosensors exhibit large changes in electrical impedance and optical properties, which is typically modulated by adsorption of a target on the CNT surface. Low detection limits and high selectivity require engineering the CNT surface and field effects, capacitance, Raman spectral shifts and photoluminescence for sensor design. Products under development include printed test strips for [[estrogen]] and [[progesterone]] detection, microarrays for DNA and protein detection and sensors for {{chem|NO|2}} and cardiac [[troponin]]. Similar CNT sensors support food industry, military and environmental applications.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

CNTs can be internalized by cells, first by binding their tips to [[cell membrane]] receptors. This enables [[transfection]] of molecular cargo attached to the CNT walls or encapsulated by CNTs. For example, the cancer drug [[doxorubicin]] was loaded at up to 60 wt % on CNTs compared with a maximum of 8 to 10 wt % on liposomes. Cargo release can be triggered by [[Infrared radiation#Regions within the infrared|near-infrared radiation]]. However, limiting the retention of CNTs within the body is critical to prevent undesirable accumulation.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

CNT toxicity remains a concern, although CNT biocompatibility may be engineerable. The degree of lung inflammation caused by injection of well-dispersed SWNTs was insignificant compared with [[asbestos]] and with particulate matter in air. Medical acceptance of CNTs requires understanding of immune response and appropriate exposure standards for inhalation, injection, ingestion and skin contact. CNT forests immobilized in a polymer did not show elevated inflammatory response in rats relative to controls. CNTs are under consideration as low-impedance neural interface electrodes and for coating of catheters to reduce [[thrombosis]].&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

CNT enabled x-ray sources for medical imaging are also in development. Relying on the unique properties of the CNTs, researchers have developed field emission cathodes that allow precise x-ray control and close placement of multiple sources. CNT enabled x-ray sources have been demonstrated for pre-clinical, small animal imaging applications, and are currently in clinical trials.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In November 2012 researchers at the American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) proved that single-wall carbon nanotubes may help protect DNA molecules from damage by [[oxidation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Tu|first2=X.|last3=Dizdaroglu|first3=M.|last4=Zheng|first4=M.|last5=Nelson|first5=B.

Carbon nanotubes have furthermore been grown inside microfluidic channels for chemical analysis, based on electrochromatography. Here, the high surface-area-to-volume ratio and high hydrophobicity of CNTs are used in order to greatly decrease the analysis time of small neutral molecules that typically require large bulky equipment for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Chen|first2=M.|last3=Molhave|first3=K.|last4=Boggild|first4=P.|last5=Kutter|first5=J.

MWNTs were first used as electrically conductive fillers in metals, at concentrations as high as 83.78 percent by weight (wt%). MWNT-polymer composites reach conductivities as high as 10,000 S m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10 wt % loading. In the automotive industry, CNT plastics are used in electrostatic-assisted painting of mirror housings, as well as fuel lines and filters that dissipate [[electrostatic charge]].

For load-bearing applications, CNT powders are mixed with polymers or precursor resins to increase stiffness, strength and toughness. These enhancements depend on CNT diameter, aspect ratio, alignment, dispersion and interfacial interaction. Premixed resins and master batches employ CNT loadings from 0.1 to 20 wt%. Nanoscale stick-slip among CNTs and CNT-polymer contacts can increase material damping, enhancing sporting goods, including tennis racquets, baseball bats and bicycle frames.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

CNT resins enhance fiber composites, including wind turbine blades and hulls for maritime security boats that are made by enhancing [[carbon fiber]] composites with CNT-enhanced resin. CNTs are deployed as additives in the organic precursors of stronger 1-μm diameter carbon fibers. CNTs influence the arrangement of carbon in pyrolyzed fiber.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

Toward the challenge of organizing CNTs at larger scales, hierarchical fiber composites are created by growing aligned forests onto glass, [[silicon carbide]] (SiC), [[alumina]] and carbon fibers, creating so-called "fuzzy" fibers. Fuzzy [[epoxy]] CNT-SiC and CNT-alumina fabric showed 69% improved crack-opening (mode I) and/or in-plane shear interlaminar (mode II) toughness. Applications under investigation include lightning-strike protection, deicing, and structural health monitoring for aircraft.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

MWNTs can be used as a flame-retardant additive to plastics due to changes in [[rheology]] by nanotube loading. Such additives can replace halogenated [[flame retardant]]s, which face environmental restrictions.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

CNT/[[Concrete]] blends offer increased tensile strength and reduced [[crack propagation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nasibulin | first1 = A. G. | last2 = Shandakov | first2 = S.

Research yarns made from few-walled CNTs have reached a stiffness of 357 GPa and a strength of 8.8 GPa for a gauge length comparable to the millimeter-long CNTs within the yarn. Centimeter-scale gauge lengths offer only 2-GPa gravimetric strengths, matching that of [[Kevlar]].&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

Because the probability of a critical flaw increases with volume, yarns may never achieve the strength of individual CNTs. However, CNT's high surface area may provide interfacial coupling that mitigates these deficiencies. CNT yarns can be knotted without loss of strength. Coating forest-drawn CNT sheets with functional powder before inserting twist yields weavable, braidable and sewable yarns containing up to 95 wt % powder. Uses include superconducting wires, battery and fuel cell electrodes and self-cleaning textiles.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

=== Carbon nanotube springs ===

"Forests" of stretched, aligned MWNT [[Carbon nanotube springs|springs]] can achieve an [[energy density]] 10 times greater than that of steel springs, offering cycling durability, temperature insensitivity, no spontaneous discharge and arbitrary discharge rate. SWNT forests are expected to be able to store far more than MWNTs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Post to your group(s) |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/nanotechnology/carbon-nanotube-super-springs |title=Carbon Nanotube Super Springs |publisher=ASME |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alloys ===

Adding small amounts of CNTs to metals increases tensile strength and modulus with potential in aerospace and automotive structures. Commercial aluminum-MWNT composites have strengths comparable to [[stainless steel]] (0.7 to 1 GPa) at one-third the density (2.6 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), comparable to more expensive aluminium-lithium alloys.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

=== Coatings and films ===

CNTs can serve as a multifunctional coating material. For example, paint/MWNT mixtures can reduce [[biofouling]] of ship hulls by discouraging attachment of [[algae]] and [[barnacle]]s. They are a possible alternative to environmentally hazardous biocide-containing paints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beigbeder|first1=Alexandre|last2=Degee|first2=Philippe|last3=Conlan|first3=Sheelagh L.|last4=Mutton|first4=Robert J.|last5=Clare|first5=Anthony S.|last6=Pettitt|first6=Michala E.|last7=Callow|first7=Maureen E.|last8=Callow|first8=James A.|last9=Dubois|first9=Philippe|title=Preparation and characterisation of silicone-based coatings filled with carbon nanotubes and natural sepiolite and their application as marine fouling-release coatings|journal=Biofouling|date=27 June 2008|volume=24|issue=4|pages=291–302|doi=10.1080/08927010802162885|pmid=18568667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing CNTs into anticorrosion coatings for metals can enhance coating stiffness and strength and provide a path for cathodic protection.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

CNTs provide a less expensive alternative to ITO for a range of consumer devices. Besides cost, CNT's flexible, transparent conductors offer an advantage over brittle ITO coatings for flexible displays. CNT conductors can be deposited from solution and patterned by methods such as screen printing. SWNT films offer 90% transparency and a sheet resistivity of 100 ohm per square. Such films are under development for thin-film heaters, such as for defrosting windows or sidewalks.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

==== Optical power detectors ====
A spray-on mixture of carbon nanotubes and ceramic demonstrates unprecedented ability to resist damage while absorbing laser light. Such coatings that absorb as the energy of high-powered lasers without breaking down are essential for optical power detectors that measure the output of such lasers. These are used, for example, in military equipment for defusing unexploded mines. The composite consists of multiwall carbon nanotubes and a ceramic made of silicon, carbon and nitrogen. Including boron boosts the breakdown temperature. The nanotubes and graphene-like carbon transmit heat well, while the oxidation-resistant ceramic boosts damage resistance. Creating the coating involves dispersing the nanotubes in [[toluene]], to which a clear liquid polymer containing boron was added. The mixture was heated to {{convert|1100| C|F}}. The result is crushed into a fine powder, dispersed again in toluene and sprayed in a thin coat on a copper surface. The coating absorbed 97.5 percent of the light from a far-infrared laser and tolerated 15 kilowatts per square centimeter for 10 seconds. Damage tolerance is about 50 percent higher than for similar coatings, e.g., nanotubes alone and carbon paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/super-nanotubes-remarkable-spray-on-coating-combines-carbon-nanotubes-with-ceramic|title=Super-nanotubes: 'remarkable' spray-on coating combines carbon nanotubes with ceramic|publisher=KurzweilAI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Feldman|first2=A.|last3=Cromer|first3=C.|last4=Lehman|first4=J.|last5=Singh|first5=G.|year=2013|title=Very High Laser-Damage Threshold of Polymer-derived Si(B)CN- Carbon Nanotube Composite Coatings|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|volume=5|issue=7|pages=2354–2359|doi=10.1021/am302755x|pmc=|pmid=23510161|last1=Bhandavat|first1=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Radar absorption ====
{{main|Radar-absorbent material}}Radars work in the microwave frequency range, which can be absorbed by MWNTs. Applying the MWNTs to the aircraft would cause the radar to be absorbed and therefore seem to have a smaller [[radar cross-section]]. One such application could be to paint the nanotubes onto the plane. Recently there has been some work done at the [[University of Michigan]] regarding carbon nanotubes usefulness as [[stealth technology]] on aircraft. It has been found that in addition to the radar absorbing properties, the nanotubes neither reflect nor scatter visible light, making it essentially invisible at night, much like painting current [[stealth aircraft]] black except much more effective. Current limitations in manufacturing, however, mean that current production of nanotube-coated aircraft is not possible. One theory to overcome these current limitations is to cover small particles with the nanotubes and suspend the nanotube-covered particles in a medium such as paint, which can then be applied to a surface, like a stealth aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Bourzac, Katherine.

SWNTs are attractive for transistors because of their low electron scattering and their bandgap. SWNTs are compatible with field-effect transistor (FET) architectures and high-k dielectrics. Despite progress following the CNT transistor's appearance in 1998, including a tunneling FET with a subthreshold swing of &lt;60 mV per decade (2004), a radio (2007) and an FET with sub-10-nm channel length and a normalized current density of 2.41 mA μm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 V, greater than those obtained for silicon devices.

However, control of diameter, chirality, density and placement remains insufficient for commercial production. Less demanding devices of tens to thousands of SWNTs are more immediately practical. The use of CNT arrays/transistor increases output current and compensates for defects and chirality differences, improving device uniformity and reproducibility. For example, transistors using horizontally aligned CNT arrays achieved mobilities of 80&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, subthreshold slopes of 140 mV per decade and on/off ratios as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. CNT film deposition methods enable conventional semiconductor fabrication of more than 10,000 CNT devices per chip.

Printed CNT [[thin-film transistor]]s (TFTs) are attractive for driving [[organic light-emitting diode]] displays, showing higher mobility than amorphous silicon (~1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and can be deposited by low-temperature, nonvacuum methods. Flexible CNT TFTs with a mobility of 35&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and an on/off ratio of 6{{e|6}} were demonstrated. A vertical CNT FET showed sufficient current output to drive OLEDs at low voltage, enabling red-green-blue emission through a transparent CNT network. CNTs are under consideration for [[radio-frequency identification]] tags. Selective retention of semiconducting SWNTs during spin-coating and reduced sensitivity to adsorbates were demonstrated.

The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors suggests that CNTs could replace [[copper|Cu]] in microelectronic interconnects, owing to their low scattering, high current-carrying capacity, and resistance to electromigration. For this, vias comprising tightly packed (&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) metallic CNTs with low defect density and low contact resistance are needed. Recently, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)–compatible 150-nm-diameter interconnects with a single CNT–contact hole resistance of 2.8 kOhm were demonstrated on full 200-mm-diameter wafers. Also, as a replacement for solder bumps, CNTs can function both as electrical leads and heat dissipaters for use in high-power amplifiers.

Last, a concept for a nonvolatile memory based on individual CNT crossbar electromechanical switches has been adapted for commercialization by patterning tangled CNT thin films as the functional elements. This required development of ultrapure CNT suspensions that can be spin-coated and processed in industrial clean room environments and are therefore compatible with CMOS processing standards.

Simulations indicated that designs could be optimized either for high performance or for low power consumption.

{{Further|Carbon nanotubes in photovoltaics}}

One of the promising applications of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is their use in solar panels, due to their strong UV/Vis-NIR absorption characteristics. Research has shown that they can provide a sizable increase in efficiency, even at their current unoptimized state. Solar cells developed at the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] use a carbon nanotube complex, formed by a mixture of carbon nanotubes and carbon [[Buckyball (molecule)|buckyballs]] (known as [[fullerene]]s) to form snake-like structures. Buckyballs trap electrons, but they can't make electrons flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070719011151.htm|title=New Flexible Plastic Solar Panels Are Inexpensive And Easy To Make|publisher=ScienceDaily|date=July 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.A.

Additional research has been conducted on creating SWNT hybrid solar panels to increase the efficiency further. These hybrids are created by combining SWNT's with photo-excitable electron donors to increase the number of electrons generated. It has been found that the interaction between the photo-excited [[porphyrin]] and SWNT generates electro-hole pairs at the SWNT surfaces. This phenomenon has been observed experimentally, and contributes practically to an increase in efficiency up to 8.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2005|title=Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes as Integrative Building Blocks for Solar-Energy Conversion|journal=Angewandte Chemie|volume=117|issue=13|pages=2051–2054|doi=10.1002/ange.200462416|pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt;|author=Guldi, Dirk M., G.M.A. Rahman, Maurizio Prato, Norbert Jux, Shubui Qin, and Warren Ford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nanotubes can potentially replace [[indium tin oxide]] in solar cells as a transparent conductive film in solar cells to allow light to pass to the active layers and generate photocurrent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Li Zhongrui, Kunets Vasyl P., Saini Viney, and|title=Light-Harvesting Using High Density p-type Single Wall Carbon Nanotube/n-type Silicon Heterojunctions|journal=ACS Nano|volume= 3 |year=2009|pages=1407–1414|doi= 10.1021/nn900197h|pmid=19456166|issue=6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNTs in organic solar cells help reduce energy loss (carrier recombination) and enhance resistance to photooxidation. Photovoltaic technologies may someday incorporate CNT-Silicon heterojunctions to leverage efficient multiple-exciton generation at p-n junctions formed within individual CNTs. In the nearer term, commercial photovoltaics may incorporate transparent SWNT electrodes.&lt;ref name="sci1302" /&gt;

== Hydrogen storage ==

In addition to being able to store electrical energy, there has been some research in using carbon nanotubes to store hydrogen to be used as a fuel source. By taking advantage of the capillary effects of the small carbon nanotubes, it is possible to condense gases in high density inside single-walled nanotubes. This allows for gases, most notably hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), to be stored at high densities without being condensed into a liquid. Potentially, this storage method could be used on vehicles in place of gas fuel tanks for a hydrogen-powered car. A current issue regarding hydrogen-powered vehicles is the on-board storage of the fuel. Current storage methods involve cooling and condensing the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas to a liquid state for storage which causes a loss of potential energy (25–45%) when compared to the energy associated with the gaseous state. Storage using SWNTs would allow one to keep the H2 in its gaseous state, thereby increasing the storage efficiency. This method allows for a volume to energy ratio slightly smaller to that of current gas powered vehicles, allowing for a slightly lower but comparable range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dillon, A. C., K. M. Jones, T. A. Bekkedahl, C. H. Klang, D. S. Bethune, and M. J. Heben|title=Storage of hydrogen in single-walled carbon nanotubes|journal=Nature|volume= 386|year=1997|doi=10.1038/386377a0|pages=377–379|issue=6623|bibcode = 1997Natur.386..377D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of controversy and frequent experimentation regarding the storage of hydrogen by adsorption in carbon nanotubes is the efficiency by which this process occurs. The effectiveness of hydrogen storage is integral to its use as a primary fuel source since hydrogen only contains about one fourth the energy per unit volume as gasoline. Studies however show that what is the most important is the surface area of the materials used. Hence activated carbon with surface area of 2600 m2/g can store up to 5,8% w/w. In all these carbonaceous materials, hydrogen is stored by physisorption at 70-90K.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Kwon|first2=Y. K.|last3=Bradley|first3=K.|last4=Gabriel|first4=J. C.

=== Experimental capacity ===

One experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Investigating Hydrogen Storage Behavior of Carbon Nanotubes at Ambient Temperature and Above by Ion Beam Analysis|journal=NANO|volume=5|issue=6|pages=341–347|doi=10.1142/S1793292010002256|author1=Safa, S.|author2=Mojtahedzadeh Larijani, M.|author3=Fathollahi, V.|author4=Kakuee, O. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought to determine the amount of hydrogen stored in CNTs by utilizing [[elastic recoil detection|elastic recoil detection analysis]] (ERDA). CNTs (primarily SWNTs) were synthesized via [[chemical vapor disposition]] (CVD) and subjected to a two-stage purification process including air oxidation and acid treatment, then formed into flat, uniform discs and exposed to pure, pressurized hydrogen at various temperatures. When the data was analyzed, it was found that the ability of CNTs to store hydrogen decreased as temperature increased. Moreover, the highest hydrogen concentration measured was ~0.18%; significantly lower than commercially viable hydrogen storage needs to be. A separate experimental work performed by using a gravimetric method also revealed the maximum hydrogen uptake capacity of CNTs to be as low as 0.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Tsotsis|first2=T. T.|last3=Sahimi|first3=M.|year=2014|title=Chemisorption, physisorption and hysteresis during hydrogen storage in carbon nanotubes|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1390–1397|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.10.163|last1=Barghi|first1=S. H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another experiment,{{citation needed|reason=Need RS|date=March 2016}} CNTs were synthesized via CVD and their structure was characterized using [[Raman spectroscopy]]. Utilizing [[microwave digestion]], the samples were exposed to different acid concentrations and different temperatures for various amounts of time in an attempt to find the optimum purification method for SWNTs of the diameter determined earlier. The purified samples were then exposed to hydrogen gas at various high pressures, and their [[adsorption]] by weight percent was plotted. The data showed that hydrogen adsorption levels of up to 3.7% are possible with a very pure sample and under the proper conditions. It is thought that microwave digestion helps improve the hydrogen adsorption capacity of the CNTs by opening up the ends, allowing access to the inner cavities of the nanotubes.

=== Limitations on efficient hydrogen adsorption ===

The biggest obstacle to efficient hydrogen storage using CNTs is the purity of the nanotubes. To achieve maximum hydrogen adsorption, there must be minimum [[graphene]], amorphous carbon, and metallic deposits in the nanotube sample. Current methods of CNT synthesis require a purification step. However, even with pure nanotubes, the adsorption capacity is only maximized under high pressures, which are undesirable in commercial fuel tanks.

CNTs can be used as [[electron gun]]s in miniature [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRT) in high-brightness, low-energy, low-weight displays. A display would consist of a group of tiny CRTs, each providing the [[electron]]s to illuminate the [[phosphor]] of one [[pixel]], instead of having one CRT whose electrons are aimed using electric and [[magnetic field]]s.

Conductive CNTs are used in [[brush (electric)|brush]]es for commercial electric motors. They replace traditional [[carbon black]]. The nanotubes improve electrical and thermal conductivity because they stretch through the plastic matrix of the brush. This permits the carbon filler to be reduced from 30% down to 3.6%, so that more matrix is present in the brush. Nanotube composite motor brushes are better-lubricated (from the matrix), cooler-running (both from better lubrication and superior thermal conductivity), less brittle (more matrix, and fiber reinforcement), stronger and more accurately moldable (more matrix). Since brushes are a critical failure point in electric motors, and also don't need much material, they became economical before almost any other application.

The activated charcoal used in conventional ultracapacitors has many small hollow spaces of various size, which create together a large surface to store electric charge. But as charge is quantized into elementary charges, i.e. electrons, and each such elementary charge needs a minimum space, a significant fraction of the electrode surface is not available for storage because the hollow spaces are not compatible with the charge's requirements. With a nanotube electrode the spaces may be tailored to size—few too large or too small—and consequently the capacity should be increased considerably.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;Halber, Deborah.

CNT can be used for [[desalination]]. Water molecules can be separated from salt by forcing them through electrochemically robust nanotube networks with controlled nanoscale porosity. This process requires far lower pressures than conventional [[reverse osmosis]] methods. Compared to a plain membrane, it operates at a 20&amp;nbsp;°C lower temperature, and at a 6x greater flow rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110314140632.htm |title=New desalination process developed using carbon nanotubes |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2011-03-15 |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membranes using aligned, encapsulated CNTs with open ends permit flow through the CNTs' interiors. Very-small-diameter SWNTs are needed to reject salt at seawater concentrations. Portable filters containing CNT meshes can purify contaminated drinking water. Such networks can electrochemically oxidize organic contaminants, bacteria and viruses.&lt;ref name=sci1302/&gt;

CNT membranes can filter [[carbon dioxide]] from power plant emissions.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

CNT can be filled with biological molecules, aiding [[biotechnology]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

CNT have the potential to store between 4.2 and 65% [[hydrogen economy|hydrogen]] by weight. If they can be mass-produced economically, {{convert|13.2|l}} of CNT could contain the same amount of energy as a {{convert|50|l}} gasoline tank.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

CNTs can be used to produce nanowires of other elements/molecules, such as [[gold]] or [[zinc oxide]]. Nanowires in turn can be used to cast nanotubes of other materials, such as [[gallium nitride]]. These can have very different properties from CNTs—for example, gallium nitride nanotubes are [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]], while CNTs are [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], giving them possible uses in organic chemistry.

Oscillators based on CNT have achieved speeds of &gt; 50&amp;nbsp;[[GHz]].

CNT electrical and mechanical properties suggest them as alternatives to traditional electrical actuators. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

=== Actuators ===
{{Main|Carbon nanotube actuators}}The exceptional electrical and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes have made them alternatives to the traditional electrical actuators for both microscopic and macroscopic applications. Carbon nanotubes are very good conductors of both electricity and heat, and they are also very strong and elastic molecules in certain directions.

=== Loudspeaker ===
Carbon nanotubes have also been applied in the acoustics (such as loudspeaker and earphone). In 2008 it was shown that a sheet of nanotubes can operate as a loudspeaker if an alternating current is applied. The sound is not produced through vibration but [[Thermoacoustics|thermoacoustically]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Flexible, Stretchable, Transparent Carbon Nanotube Thin Film Loudspeakers|journal=Nano Letters|volume=8|issue=12|pages=4539–4545|bibcode=2008NanoL...8.4539X|doi=10.1021/nl802750z|pmid=19367976|author1=Xiao|first1=L|last2=Chen|first2=Z|last3=Feng|first3=C|last4=Liu|first4=L|last5=Bai|first5=Z.

=== Environmental remediation ===
A CNT nano-structured sponge (nanosponge) containing sulfur and iron is more effective at soaking up water contaminants such as oil, fertilizers, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Their magnetic properties make them easier to retrieve once the clean-up job is done. The sulfur and iron increases sponge size to around {{convert|2|cm}}. It also increases porosity due to beneficial defects, creating buoyancy and reusability. Iron, in the form of [[ferrocene]] makes the structure easier to control and enables recovery using magnets. Such nanosponges increase the absorption of the toxic [[organic solvent]] [[dichlorobenzene]] from water by 3.5 times. The sponges can absorb [[vegetable oil]] up to 150 times their initial weight and can absorb [[engine oil]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/carbon-nanotube-sponges/30511|title=Magnetic nanosponges more effective a soaking up oil spills|date=19 January 2004|author=Grant Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Pisani|first2=C.|last3=Gautron|first3=E.|last4=Scarselli|first4=M.|last5=Castrucci|first5=P.|last6=d'Orazio|first6=F.|last7=Passacantando|first7=M.|last8=Moscone|first8=D.|last9=De Crescenzi|first9=M.|year=2014|title=A three-dimensional carbon nanotube network for water treatment|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=25|issue=6|page=065701|bibcode=2014Nanot..25f5701C|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/25/6/065701|pmc=|pmid=24434944|last1=Camilli|first1=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, a magnetic boron-doped MWNT nanosponge that could absorb oil from water. The sponge was grown as a forest on a substrate via chemical vapor disposition. Boron puts kinks and elbows into the tubes as they grow and promotes the formation of [[covalent bond]]s. The nanosponges retain their elastic property after 10,000 compressions in the lab. The sponges are both [[superhydrophobic]], forcing them to remain at the water's surface and oleophilic, drawing oil to them.&lt;ref&gt;Quick, Darren (17 April 2012) [http://www.gizmag.com/oil-absorbing-nanosponge/22180/ Reusable oil-absorbing nanosponges could soak up oil spills].

A [[flywheel]] made of carbon nanotubes could be spun at extremely high velocity on a floating magnetic axis in a vacuum, and potentially store energy at a [[Energy density|density]] approaching that of conventional fossil fuels. Since energy can be added to and removed from flywheels very efficiently in the form of electricity, this might offer a way of [[Grid energy storage|storing electricity]], making the electrical grid more efficient and variable power suppliers (like wind turbines) more useful in meeting energy needs. The practicality of this depends heavily upon the cost of making massive, unbroken nanotube structures, and their failure rate under stress.

[[Carbon nanotube springs]] have the potential to indefinitely store elastic potential energy at ten times the density of lithium-ion batteries with flexible charge and discharge rates and extremely high cycling durability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2070">'''Pure bending''' is a condition of stress where a [[bending moment]] is applied to a beam without the simultaneous presence of [[Cylinder stress|axial]], [[Shear stress|shear]], or [[Deformation (mechanics)|torsional forces]].
Pure bending occurs only under a constant bending moment (M) since the shear force (V), which is equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{dM}{dx} = V&lt;/math&gt;, has to be equal to zero. In reality, a state of pure bending does not practically exist, because such a state needs an absolutely weightless member. The state of pure bending is an approximation made to derive formulas.

==Kinematics of pure bending==
#In pure bending the axial lines bend to form [[circumference|circumferential line]]s and [[transverse line]]s remain straight and become [[radial line]]s.
#Axial lines that do not extend or contract form a neutral surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://emweb.unl.edu/negahban/em325/11-Bending/Bending.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions made in the theory of Pure Bending==
#The material of the beam is homogeneous&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and isotropic&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
#The value of Young's [[Modulus of Elasticity]] is same in tension and compression.
#The transverse sections which were plane before bending, remain plane after bending also.
#The beam is initially straight and all longitudinal filaments bend into circular arcs with a common centre of curvature.
#The radius of curvature is large as compared to the dimensions of the cross-section.
#Each layer of the beam is free to expand or contract, independently of the layer, above or below it.
Notes: &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Homogeneous means the material is of same kind throughout. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Isotropic means that the elastic properties in all directions are equal.

[[File:Paraboloid of Revolution.svg|thumb|Axially symmetrical paraboloid. The inside surface is concave]]

A '''rotating furnace''' is a device for making solid objects which have concave surfaces that are segments of [[axial symmetry|axially symmetrical]] [[paraboloid]]s. Usually, the objects are made of [[glass]]. The [[furnace]] makes use of the fact, which was known already to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], that the centrifugal-force-induced shape of the top surface of a spinning liquid is a concave paraboloid, identical to the shape of a reflecting telescope's primary focusing mirror.

Paraboloids can be used in various ways, including (after being [[silvering|silvered]]) as [[primary mirror]]s in [[reflecting telescope]]s and [[solar cooker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://solarcooking.org/research/SpinningParaboicConcentrators.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Parabola shape in rotating layers of fluid.jpg|thumb|Parabolic shape formed by a liquid surface under rotation. Two liquids of different densities completely fill a narrow space between two sheets of plexiglass. The gap between the sheets is closed at the bottom, sides and top. The whole assembly is rotating around a vertical axis passing through the centre]]

The furnace includes a mechanism that rotates an open-topped container at constant speed around a vertical axis. A quantity of glass sufficient to make the mirror is placed in the container, heated until it is completely molten, and then allowed to cool while continuing to rotate until it has completely solidified. When the rotation is stopped, the glass is solid, so the paraboloidal shape of its top surface is preserved. This process is called [[spin casting (mirrors)|spin casting]].

The same process can be used to make a [[lens (optics)|lens]] with a concave paraboloidal surface. The other surface is shaped by the container that holds the molten glass acting as a mould. Lenses made this way are sometimes used as [[objective (optics)|objectives]] in [[refracting telescope]]s.

The word ''spin'' is frequently used in this context without implying that the rotation is rapid. Making a mirror with a focal length of five metres, for example, requires a rotation speed less than ten revolutions per minute. Since the speed is low, accurate [[balancing of rotating masses|dynamic balancing]] of the rotating components is not needed.

The axis of rotation becomes the axis of the paraboloid. It is not necessary for this axis to be in the centre of the container of glass, or even for it to pass through the container. By placing the container away from the axis, off-axis paraboloidal segments can be cast. This is done in the making of very large telescopes which have mirrors consisting of several segments.

==Mathematical model==
{{For|a theoretical explanation|Liquid mirror telescope#Explanation of the equilibrium}}

===Rotation speed and focal length===
The focal length of the paraboloid is related to the angular speed at which the liquid is rotated by the equation: &lt;math&gt;2f \omega^2=g&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the focal length, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the rotation speed, and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration due to gravity]]. They must be in compatible units so, for example, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; can be in metres, &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; in radians per second, and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; in metres per second-squared. The angle unit in &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; must be [[radian]]s. 1 radian per second is about 9.55 rotations per minute ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]). On the Earth's surface, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is about 9.81 metres per second-squared. Putting these numbers into the equation produces the approximation: &lt;math&gt;fs^2 \approx 447&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the focal length in metres, and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the rotation speed in RPM.

==Uses==
Generally, a spin-cast paraboloid is not sufficiently accurate to permit its immediate use as a telescope mirror or lens, so it is corrected by computer-controlled grinding machines. The amount of grinding done, and the mass of glass material wasted, are much less than would have been required without spinning.

Spin casting can also be used, often with materials other than glass, to produce prototype paraboloids, such as spotlight reflectors or solar-energy concentrators, which do not need to be as exactly paraboloidal as telescope mirrors. Spin casting every paraboloid that is made would be too slow and costly, so the prototype is simply copied relatively quickly and cheaply and with adequate accuracy.

[[Liquid mirror telescope]]s have rotating mirrors that consist of a liquid metal such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or a [[low-melting alloy]] of [[gallium]]. The mirrors do not solidify, but are used while liquid and rotating. The rotation shapes them into paraboloids that are accurate enough to be used as primary reflectors in telescopes. No correction of the shape is necessary. Spin-cast glass mirrors need correction because of distortions that arise during and after solidification.

The '''Saturn C-3''' was the third rocket in the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]] C series studied from 1959 to 1962. The design was for a three-stage launch vehicle that could launch {{convert|45,000|kg}} to [[low Earth orbit]] and send {{convert|18,000|kg}} to the Moon via [[trans-lunar injection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saturnc3.htm |title=Saturn C-3 |publisher=Astronautix.com |date= |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President Kennedy's proposal on May 25, 1961, of an [[Apollo program|explicit manned lunar landing goal]] spurred NASA to solidify its launch vehicle requirements for a lunar landing. A week earlier, William Fleming (Office of Space Flight Programs, NASA Headquarters) chaired an ad hoc committee to conduct a six-week study of the requirements for a lunar landing. Judging the direct ascent approach to be the most feasible, they concentrated their attention accordingly, and proposed circumlunar flights in late 1965 using the Saturn C-3 launch vehicle.

In early June 1961, Bruce Lundin, deputy director of the Lewis Research Center, led a week-long study of six different rendezvous possibilities. The alternatives included Earth-orbital rendezvous, lunar-orbital rendezvous, Earth and lunar rendezvous, and rendezvous on the lunar surface, employing Saturn C-1s, C-3s, and Nova designs. Lundin's committee concluded that rendezvous enjoyed distinct advantages over direct ascent and recommended an Earth-orbital rendezvous using two or three Saturn C-3s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4204/ch4-7.html |title=Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations |author1=Benson, Charles D. |author2=William Barnaby Faherty |publisher=NASA (SP-4204) |year=1978 |chapter=4-8 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA announced on September 7, 1961, that the government-owned [[Michoud Assembly Facility|Michoud Ordnance Plant]] near New Orleans, Louisiana, would be the site for fabrication and assembly of the Saturn C-3 first stage as well as larger vehicles in the Saturn program.  Finalists were two government-owned plants in St. Louis and New Orleans.  The height of the factory roof at Michoud meant that a launch vehicle with eight [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] engines ([[Nova (rocket)|Nova class]], [[Saturn C-8]]) could not be built; four or five engines would have to be the maximum.

This decision ended consideration of a Nova class launch vehicle for direct ascent to the Moon or as heavy-lift companion with the Saturn C-3 for Earth orbit rendezvous.

==Lunar mission design==

===Earth orbit rendezvous===
The Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama developed an [[Earth orbit rendezvous]] proposal (EOR) for the Apollo program in 1960-1961. The proposal used a series of small [[rocket]]s half the size of a [[Saturn V]] to launch different components of a [[spacecraft]] headed to the Moon.  These components would be assembled in [[orbit]] around the [[Earth]], then sent to the Moon via [[trans-lunar injection]]. 
In order to test and validate the feasibility of the EOR approach for the Apollo program, [[Project Gemini]] was founded with this objective: "To effect rendezvous and docking with another vehicle ([[Agena target vehicle]]), and to maneuver the combined spacecraft using the propulsion system of the target vehicle."

The Saturn C-3 was the primary launch vehicle for Earth orbit rendezvous. The booster consisted of a first stage containing two Saturn V [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]] engines, a second stage containing four powerful [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]] engines, and the S-IV stage from a [[Saturn I]] booster. Only the S-IV stage of the  Saturn C-3 was developed and flown, but all of the specified engines were used on the [[Saturn V]] rocket which took men to the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bilsten, Roger E. |publisher=NASA SP-4206 |title=Stages to Saturn |pages=48–63 |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lunar orbit rendezvous===
The concept of lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR) was studied at Langley Research Center as early as 1960.  [[John Houbolt]]'s memorandum advocating LOR for lunar missions in November 1961 to Robert Seamans outlined the usage of the Saturn C-3 launch vehicle, and avoiding complex large boosters and lunar landers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bilsten, Roger E. |publisher=NASA SP-4206 |title=Stages to Saturn |page=63 |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After six months of further discussion NASA, in the summer of 1962, selected the [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] (LOR) proposal from Langley Research Center for the Apollo program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/factsheets/Rendezvous.html |title=The Rendezvous That Was Almost Missed: Lunar Orbit Rendezvous and the Apollo Program |publisher=NASA Langley Research Center |date=December 1992 |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of 1962, the Saturn C-3 design was deemed not necessary for Apollo program requirements as larger boosters ([[Saturn C-4]], Saturn C-5) were then proposed, hence further work on the Saturn C-3 was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smartech.gatech.edu/jspui/bitstream/1853/8042/3/SSEC_SE2_doc.pdf |title=The Apollo Lunar Orbit Rendezvous Architecture Decision Revisited |publisher=National Institute of Aerospace, Georgia Tech |author1=David M.

==Variants and derivatives==
[[File:Saturn C-3 Derivatives.gif|thumbnail|Saturn C-3B versions, with a nuclear upper stage derivative (1961)]]
Since 1961 a number of variants of the Saturn C-3 have been studied, proposed, and funded.  The most extensive studies focused on the Saturn C-3B variants before end of 1962, when lunar orbit rendezvous was selected and Saturn C-5 development approved.  The common theme of these variants is a first stage with at least 3,044,000 lbf (13,540 kN) of sea-level thrust (SL). These designs used two or three Rocketdyne [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1 engine]]s in a [[S-IB]]-2 or [[S-IC]] stage and diameters ranging from 8 to 10 meters (27 to 33 feet) that could lift up to {{convert|110000|lb}} to Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

The lack of a Saturn C-3 launch vehicle in 1965 created a large payload gap (LEO) between the [[Saturn IB]]'s 21,000 kg (46,000 lb) capacity and the two-stage Saturn V's 75,000 kg (165,000 lb) capability.  In the mid-1960s NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) initiated several studies for a launch vehicle to fill this payload capacity gap and to extend the capabilities of the Saturn family. Three companies provided proposals to MSFC for this requirement: Martin Marietta (builder of Atlas, Titan vehicles), Boeing (builder of S-1B and S-1C first stages), and North American (builder of the S-II second stage).

===Saturn C-3B===
The '''Saturn C-3B''' revision (1961) increased the total thrust of the three stages to 17,200&amp;nbsp;kN. The diameter of the first stage (S-IB-2) was increased to 33 feet (10 meters).   The eventual first stage for the Saturn V (S-IC) would use this same diameter, but add 8 meters to its length. A further consideration added a third F-1 engine to the first stage.

The S-II, second stage diameter would be 8.3 meters (326 inches) and 21.3 meters (70 feet) in length. The S-IV, third stage diameter would be 5.5 meters and 12.2 meters in length.

===Saturn C-3BN===
{{main|NERVA}}
The '''Saturn C-3BN''' revision (1961) would use the [[NERVA]] for the third stage in this launch vehicle.  The NERVA technology has been studied and proposed since mid-1950s for future space exploration.
[[File:INT20C.svg|thumbnail|Saturn INT-20C, Boeing proposal (1966)]]

===Saturn INT-20===
{{main|Saturn INT-20}}
On October 7, 1966 Boeing submitted a Final Report to the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, "Studies of Improved Saturn V Vehicles and Intermediate Payload Vehicles".  That report outlined the '''Saturn INT-20''', an intermediate two-stage launch vehicle with a S-1C first stage using three or four F-1 engines, and a S-IVB as the second stage with one J-2 engine.  The vehicle's payload capacity for LEO would be 45,000 to 60,000&amp;nbsp;kg, comparable to the earlier Saturn C-3 design (1961).  Boeing projected delivery and first flight in 1970, based on a decision by 1967.

==Post-Apollo development==
The need for a launch vehicle of Saturn C-3 capacity (45 metric tons to LEO) continued beyond the Apollo program. [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37]], initially designed to serve the Saturn I and I-B, was planned for eventual Saturn C-3 usage, but it was deactivated in 1972.  In 2001, Boeing refurbished the complex for its [[Delta IV]] EELV launch vehicle.  The Delta IV Heavy variant can only launch 22.5 metric tons to LEO.
 
The 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] and 2010 [[Space Launch System]] program resulted in renewed proposals for Saturn C-3 derivatives using the Rocketdyne F-1A engines with existing booster cores and tooling (10m - Saturn [[S-IC]] stage; 8.4m - [[Space Shuttle external tank]]; 5.1m - [[Common Booster Core|Delta IV Common Booster Core]]).

===Jarvis===
{{main|Jarvis (rocket)}}
After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], the United States Air Force (USAF) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) conducted a joint [[Advanced Launch System]] study (1987-1990).  Hughes Aircraft and Boeing dusted off the earlier Saturn C-3 design and submitted their proposal for the [[Jarvis (rocket)|Jarvis]] launch vehicle.  

The Jarvis would be a three-stage rocket, 58&amp;nbsp;m (190&amp;nbsp;ft) in height and 8.38&amp;nbsp;m (27.5&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter.  Designed to lift 38 tons to LEO, it would utilize F-1 and J-2 rocket engines and tooling in storage from the Saturn V rocket program along with more recent Shuttle-era technologies to provide lower launch costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/jarvis.htm |title=Jarvis launch vehicle |publisher=Astronautix.com |date= |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pyrios===
{{update section|date=January 2016}}
{{as of|2012|4}}, [[Dynetics]] announced they were teaming with Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne to resurrect the Saturn V rocket's mighty F-1 engine to power NASA's [[Space Launch System]] planned heavy-lift launch vehicle, saying the Apollo-era engine will offer significantly more performance than solid-fueled boosters currently under development.  

Dynetics of Huntsville, Alabama, is leading the contractor team proposing the F-1 engine design. Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne is the bid's propulsion partner and engine builder.  Cook, NASA's former manager of the scrapped Ares rocket program, said each of the two Dynetics boosters, on an SLS mission would be propelled by a pair of [[RP-1]]/[[LOX]] [[Rocketdyne F-1#F-1B booster|F-1B]]s, an advanced variant of the F-1, (1.5 million pounds of thrust) which was used on the Saturn V, and the F-1A. Developed during the later stages of the Apollo program, the F-1A was test fired, but never flew. Several were crated and stored by Rocketdyne (later Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne). The company has also maintained an F-1/F-1A knowledge retention program for its engineers for the entire period the engine has been mothballed. Dynetics is now performing tests on engine components pulled from storage."Each of those engines (F-1A) can get up to 1.8 million pounds of thrust (8,000 kN)," Cook said in an interview Wednesday. "This booster is a very simple, very standard booster. It's 18 feet (5.5 m) in diameter. It uses the same attach points as the current five-segment solid rocket booster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1204/18dynetics/ |title=Rocket companies hope to repurpose Saturn 5 engines |publisher=Spaceflight Now |author=Stephen Clark |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Dynetics booster would attach at these points, in the SLS parallel staging design, which differs from the Saturn rockets' serial staging design. Because it applies thrust to an upper thrust beam in the SLS core, it lifts at the top rather than at the bottom (Saturn S-IC stage had a thrust structure).  The proposed Dynetics booster is similar to the first stage of the Saturn C-3 in that it would employ two F-1 heritage engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/11/dynetics-pwr-liquidize-sls-booster-competition-f-1-power/ |title=Dynetics and PWR aiming to liquidize SLS booster competition with F-1 power |publisher=Spaceflight.com |author=Chris Bergin |date=9 November 2012 |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/new-f-1b-rocket-engine-upgrades-apollo-era-deisgn-with-1-8m-lbs-of-thrust/ |title=New F-1B rocket engine upgrades Apollo-era design with 1.8M lbs of thrust |publisher=ars technica |author=Lee Hutchinson |date=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2790">[[Image:Hoyt_model.svg|right|thumb|400px|A basic version of the Sector model]]

The '''sector model''', also known as the '''Hoyt model''', is a model of urban [[land use]] proposed in 1939 by land economist [[Homer Hoyt]].&lt;ref name="Hoyt"&gt;Hoyt, H. (1939) ''The Structure and Growth of Residential Neighborhoods in American Cities'' Washington, Federal Housing Administration&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modification of the [[concentric zone model]] of [[city]] development. The benefits of the application of this model include the fact it allows for an outward progression of growth. As with all simple models of such complex phenomena, its validity is limited.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, P.J. (1962) "Calgary: A study in urban pattern", ''Economic Geography'', 38(4), pp.315-329&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application ==
This model applies to numerous British cities. Also, if it is turned 90 degrees counter-clockwise it fits the city of [[Mönchengladbach]] reasonably accurately. This may be because of the age of the cities when transportation was a key, as a general rule older cities follow the Hoyt model and more recent cities follow the Burgess (concentric zone) model.

==Limitations ==
The theory is based on early twentieth-century rail transport and does not make allowances for private cars that enable [[commuting]] from cheaper land outside city boundaries.&lt;ref name="Rodwin"&gt;Rodwin, L. (1950) "The Theory of Residential Growth and Structure", ''Appraisal Journal'', 18, pp.295-317&lt;/ref&gt;  This occurred in [[Calgary]] in the 1930s when many near-[[slums]] were established outside the city but close to the termini of the [[tram|street car]] lines.  These are now incorporated into the city boundary but are pockets of low cost housing in medium cost areas.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; The theory also does not take into account the new concepts of edge cities and boomburbs, which began to emerge in the 1980s, after the creation of the model. Since its creation, the traditional Central Business District has diminished in importance as many retail and office buildings have moved into the suburbs.
*Physical features - physical features may restrict or direct growth along certain wedges
*The growth of a sector can be limited by [[exurb|leapfrog]] land.
*the theory too lacks the idea based on land topography.

'''Sociology''' is the scientific study of [[society]], patterns of social relationships, [[social interaction]], and [[culture]] of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;sociology. (n.d.). ''The American Heritage Science Dictionary''. Retrieved 13 July 2013, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sociology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.colgate.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/sociology-a-21st-century-major.pdf?sfvrsn=0|title=Sociology: A 21st Century Major|publisher=American Sociological Association|accessdate=19 July 2017|via=Colgate.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/introtosociology/Documents/Field%20of%20sociology033108.htm#whatissociology|title=An Introduction to Sociology|website=asanet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[social science]] that uses various methods of [[Empirical method|empirical investigation]]&lt;ref name="Classical Statements8" /&gt; and [[critical analysis]]&lt;ref name="Classical Statements4" /&gt; to develop a body of knowledge about [[social order]], acceptance, and change or social evolution. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to [[social policy]] and [[welfare]], while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the [[micro-sociology]] level of individual [[agency (sociology)|agency]] and interaction to the [[macro-sociology|macro]] level of systems and the [[social structure]].&lt;ref name="Giddens Intro" /&gt;

The different traditional focuses of sociology include [[social stratification]], [[social class]], [[social mobility]], [[sociology of religion|religion]], [[secularization]], [[Sociology of law|law]], [[sexuality]], [[gender]], and [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]]. As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between [[structure and agency|social structure and individual agency]], sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects, such as [[sociology of health|health]], [[medical sociology|medical]], [[economic sociology|economy]], [[military sociology|military]] and [[sociology of punishment|penal]] [[institution]]s, [[sociology of the Internet|the Internet]], [[sociology of Education|education]], [[social capital]], and the role of social activity in the development of [[sociology of scientific knowledge|scientific knowledge]].

The range of social scientific methods has also expanded. [[Social research]]ers draw upon a variety of [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[quantitative research|quantitative]] techniques. The [[linguistic turn|linguistic]] and [[cultural turn]]s of the mid-20th century led to increasingly [[verstehen|interpretative]], [[hermeneutic]], and [[philosophic]] approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s have seen the rise of new [[analytical sociology|analytically]], [[Mathematical sociology|mathematically]], and [[computational sociology|computationally]] rigorous techniques, such as [[agent-based model]]ling and [[social network|social network analysis]].&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;&lt;ref name="Computational Social Science"/&gt;

Social research informs [[politician]]s and [[public policy|policy makers]], [[education|educators]], [[urban planner|planners]], [[legislator]]s, [[Public administration|administrators]], [[Real estate development|developers]], [[business magnate]]s, managers, [[social worker]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s, [[non-profit organization]]s, and people interested in resolving [[social issues]] in general. There is often a great deal of crossover between social research, [[market research]], and other [[statistics|statistical]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Ibn Khaldoun-Kassus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ibn Khaldun]] statue in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]] (1332–1406)]]

Sociological reasoning predates the foundation of the discipline. [[Social analysis]] has origins in the common stock of [[Western culture|Western knowledge]] and [[philosophy]], and has been carried out from as far back as the time of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosopher]] [[Plato]], if not before.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The origin of the [[Statistical survey|survey]], i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, can be traced back to at least the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,&lt;ref&gt;[[A. H. Halsey]] (2004), ''A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell (1970), ''A new dictionary of sociology'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; while ancient philosophers such as [[Confucius]] wrote about the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arab writings. Some sources consider [[Ibn Khaldun]], a 14th-century [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] scholar from North Africa (Tunisia), to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/15127|title=A sociological analysis of Ibn Khaldun's theory : a study in the sociology of knowledge|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhaouadi|first=Mahmoud|date=September 1, 1990|title=Ibn Khaldun: The founding father of eastern sociology|journal=International Sociology|volume=5|issue=3|pages=319–335|doi=10.1177/026858090005003007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Faridah Hj|date=|title=Ibn Khaldun and Jane Addams:  The Real Father of Sociology and the Mother of Social Works|journal=Faculty of Business Management Universiti Teknologi Mara, Malaysia|volume=|pages=|citeseerx=10.1.1.510.3556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264385117|title=Debating the Origins of Sociology Ibn Khaldun as a Founding Father of Sociology|last=Mehmet M. &amp; Gilbert P.|first=|date=January 2012|website=Research Gate|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Early Islamic philosophy#Branches|Branches of the early Islamic philosophy]]); his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on [[social cohesion]] and [[social conflict]].&lt;ref name="Akhtar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Autonomous, the Universal and the Future of Sociology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mowlana"/&gt;

The word ''[[wiktionary:sociology|sociology]]'' (or ''"sociologie"'') is derived from both Latin and Greek origins. The [[Latin]] word: ''[[wiktionary:socius|socius]]'', "companion"; the suffix ''[[wiktionary:-logy|-logy]]'', "the study of" from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]] from [[wiktionary:λόγος|λόγος]], ''lógos'', "word", "knowledge". It was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès]] (1748–1836) in an unpublished [[manuscript]].&lt;ref&gt;''Des Manuscrits de Sieyès. 1773–1799'', Volumes I and II, published by Christine Fauré, Jacques Guilhaumou, Jacques Vallier and Françoise Weil, Paris, Champion, 1999 and 2007. See also Christine Fauré and Jacques Guilhaumou, ''Sieyès et le non-dit de la sociologie: du mot à la chose'', in ''Revue d'histoire des sciences humaines'', Numéro 15, novembre 2006: Naissances de la science sociale. See also the article [[:fr:sociologie|'sociologie']] in the French-language Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sociology'' was later defined independently by the French [[philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) in 1838&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt; as a new way of looking at society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=10 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte had earlier used the term ''social physics'', but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician [[Adolphe Quetelet]]. Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology, and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the [[French Revolution]], he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological [[positivism]], an epistemological approach outlined in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'' (1830–1842) and ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (1848). Comte believed a [[Law of three stages|positivist stage]] would mark the final era, after conjectural [[theological]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] phases, in the progression of human understanding.&lt;ref name="comte"/&gt; In observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and having classified the sciences, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ |title=Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte |publisher=Plato.Stanford.edu |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auguste Comte2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857)]]
{{Quote|Comte gave a powerful impetus to the development of sociology, an impetus which bore fruit in the later decades of the nineteenth century. To say this is certainly not to claim that French sociologists such as [[Durkheim]] were devoted disciples of the high priest of positivism. But by insisting on the irreducibility of each of his basic sciences to the particular science of sciences which it presupposed in the hierarchy and by emphasizing the nature of sociology as the scientific study of social phenomena Comte put sociology on the map. To be sure, [its] beginnings can be traced back well beyond [[Montesquieu]], for example, and to [[Condorcet]], not to speak of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], Comte's immediate predecessor. But Comte's clear recognition of sociology as a particular science, with a character of its own, justified Durkheim in regarding him as the father or founder of this science, in spite of the fact that Durkheim did not accept the idea of the three states and criticized Comte's approach to sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Copleson, Frederick S. J. [1974] ''A History of Philosophy: IX Modern Philosophy'' (1994).

{{Quote|To have given clear and unified answers in familiar empirical terms to those theoretical questions which most occupied men's minds at the time, and to have deduced from them clear practical directives without creating obviously artificial links between the two, was the principal achievement of Marx's theory. The sociological treatment of historical and moral problems, which Comte and after him, [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]] and [[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]], had discussed and mapped, became a precise and concrete study only when the attack of militant Marxism made its conclusions a burning issue, and so made the search for evidence more zealous and the attention to method more intense.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah.

[[File:Spencer-detail.png|upright|thumb|right|[[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903)]]
[[Herbert Spencer]] (27 April 1820&amp;nbsp;– 8 December 1903) was one of the most popular and influential 19th-century sociologists. It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th-century thinkers, including [[Émile Durkheim]], defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim's ''[[Division of Labour in Society]]'' is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively.&lt;ref name="Émile Durkheim's Division of Labor and the Shadow of Herbert Spencer"/&gt; Also a notable [[biologist]], Spencer coined the term ''[[survival of the fittest]]''. While Marxian ideas defined one strand of sociology, Spencer was a critic of socialism as well as strong advocate for a [[laissez-faire]] style of government. His ideas were closely observed by conservative political circles, especially in the [[United States]] and [[England]].&lt;ref name=Commanger/&gt;

===Foundations of the academic discipline===
{{Main|Émile Durkheim|Social facts}}
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
The first formal Department of Sociology in the world was established by [[Albion Woodbury Small|Albion Small]] - at the invitation of [[William Rainey Harper]] - at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1892, and the [[American Journal of Sociology]] was founded shortly thereafter in 1895 by Small as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dibble, Vernonk. 1975. "The Legacy of Albion Small." Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the institutionalization of sociology as an academic discipline was chiefly led by Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical [[social research]]. While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name=Poggi /&gt; For Durkheim, sociology could be described as the "science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] "The Rules of Sociological Method" 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's monograph ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897) is considered a seminal work in statistical analysis by contemporary sociologists. ''Suicide'' is a case study of variations in suicide rates among [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, and served to distinguish sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy. It also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of [[structural functionalism]]. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or [[psychological]]) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''[[sui generis]]'' "social facts" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social [[anomie]]".

Sociology quickly evolved as an academic response to the perceived challenges of [[modernity]], such as [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], [[secularization]], and the process of "[[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]: Modernity's Consciousness of Time'', Polity Press (1990), paperback, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The field predominated in [[continental Europe]], with British [[anthropology]] and [[statistics]] generally following on a separate trajectory. By the turn of the 20th century, however, many theorists were active in the [[English-speaking world]]. Few early sociologists were confined strictly to the subject, interacting also with [[economics]], [[jurisprudence]], psychology and [[philosophy]], with theories being appropriated in a variety of different fields. Since its inception, sociological epistemology, methods, and frames of inquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged.&lt;ref name="Giddens Intro"/&gt;

Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) are typically cited as the three principal architects of sociology.&lt;ref name="Max Weber&amp;nbsp;– Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy"/&gt; [[Herbert Spencer]], [[William Graham Sumner]], [[Lester F. Ward]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[Werner Sombart]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Karl Mannheim]] are often included on academic curricula as founding theorists. Curricula also may include [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Marianne Weber]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] as founders of the feminist tradition in sociology. Each key figure is associated with a particular theoretical perspective and orientation.&lt;ref name="transformation325"/&gt;

{{Quote|Marx and Engels associated the emergence of modern society above all with the development of capitalism; for Durkheim it was connected in particular with industrialization and the new social division of labor which this brought about; for Weber it had to do with the emergence of a distinctive way of thinking, the rational calculation which he associated with the Protestant Ethic (more or less what Marx and Engels speak of in terms of those 'icy waves of egotistical calculation'). Together the works of these great classical sociologists suggest what Giddens has recently described as 'a multidimensional view of institutions of modernity' and which emphasises not only capitalism and industrialism as key institutions of modernity, but also 'surveillance' (meaning 'control of information and social supervision') and 'military power' (control of the means of violence in the context of the industrialisation of war).&lt;ref name="transformation325"/&gt;|John Harriss|''The Second Great Transformation? Capitalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' 1992}}

===Positivism and anti-positivism===
====Positivism====
{{Main|Positivism}}
The overarching [[methodology|methodological]] principle of [[positivism]] is to conduct sociology in broadly the same manner as [[natural science]]. An emphasis on [[empiricism]] and the [[scientific method]] is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research based on the assumption that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology.

{{quote|Our main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct.... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism.&lt;ref name="DinW"/&gt;|[[Émile Durkheim]]|''The Rules of Sociological Method'' (1895)}}

The term has long since ceased to carry this meaning; there are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"/&gt; Many of these approaches do not self-identify as "positivist", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical [[empiricism]]. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also diverged, with many rejecting the scientific method and others only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th-century developments in the philosophy of science. However, positivism (broadly understood as a scientific approach to the study of society) remains dominant in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;

[[Loïc Wacquant]] distinguishes three major strains of positivism: [[Durkheimian]], Logical, and Instrumental.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; None of these are the same as that set forth by Comte, who was unique in advocating such a rigid (and perhaps optimistic) version.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; While Émile Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method. Durkheim maintained that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisted that they should retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; He developed the notion of objective ''sui generis'' "social facts" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;

The variety of positivism that remains dominant today is termed ''instrumental positivism''. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as the nature of social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, [[replicability]], [[reliabilism|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]].&lt;ref name="Gartell"/&gt; This positivism is more or less synonymous with [[quantitative research]], and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to [[Paul Lazarsfeld]],&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what [[Robert K. Merton]] called [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]]: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.&lt;ref name="Boudon"/&gt;

====Anti-positivism====
{{Main|Anti-positivism}}
Reactions against social empiricism began when German philosopher [[Hegel]] voiced opposition to both empiricism, which he rejected as uncritical, and determinism, which he viewed as overly mechanistic.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements"/&gt; [[Karl Marx]]'s methodology borrowed from [[Hegelian dialectic]]ism but also a rejection of positivism in favour of critical analysis, seeking to supplement the empirical acquisition of "facts" with the elimination of illusions.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements2"/&gt; He maintained that appearances need to be critiqued rather than simply documented. Early hermeneuticians such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] pioneered the distinction between natural and social science ('[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'). Various [[neo-Kantian]] philosophers, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]]s and [[Human science|human scientists]] further theorized how the analysis of the [[social reality|social world]] differs to that of the [[natural environment|natural world]] due to the irreducibly complex aspects of human society, [[culture]], and [[being]].&lt;ref&gt;Rickman, H. P. (1960) ''The Reaction against Positivism and Dilthey's Concept of Understanding'', The London School of Economics and Political Science. p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Max Weber: essays in sociology|last = Weber|first = Max|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1946|isbn = |location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Italian context of development of social sciences and of sociology in particular, there are oppositions to the first foundation of the discipline, sustained by speculative philosophy in accordance with the antiscientific tendencies matured by critique of positivism and evolutionism, so a tradition Progressist struggles to establish itself (Cfr. Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''La scienza e l'oggetto. Autocritica del sapere strategico'', Milan, Franco Angeli, 2010, p. 52 e sg., {{ISBN|978-88-568-2487-2}}). 

At the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological [[anti-positivism]], proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s, [[value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbol]]s, and social processes viewed from a resolutely [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective. Max Weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify [[causality|causal relationships]] of human "[[social action]]"—especially among "[[ideal type]]s", or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements5"/&gt; As a non-positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as "historical, invariant, or generalisable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"/&gt; as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], theorised on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on "[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]" (lit. ''community'' and ''society''). Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way ("pure sociology"), whereas the second empirically and inductively ("applied sociology").&lt;ref&gt;*Ferdinand Tönnies (ed. Jose Harris), ''Community and Civil Society'', Cambridge University Press (2001), hardcover, 266 pages, {{ISBN|0-521-56119-1}}; trade paperback, Cambridge University Press (2001), 266 pages, {{ISBN|0-521-56782-3}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Max Weber]]]]
{{Quote|[Sociology is] ... the science whose object is to interpret ''the meaning of social action'' and thereby give a ''causal explanation'' of the way in which the ''action proceeds'' and the ''effects which it produces''. By 'action' in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent that the agent or agents see it as ''subjectively meaningful'' ... the meaning to which we refer may be either (a) the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases, or (b) the meaning attributed to the agent or agents, as types, in a pure type constructed in the abstract. In neither case is the 'meaning' to be thought of as somehow objectively 'correct' or 'true' by some metaphysical criterion. This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action, such as sociology and history, and any kind of ''prior'' discipline, such as jurisprudence, logic, ethics, or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject-matter 'correct' or 'valid' meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max ''The Nature of Social Action'' in Runciman, W.G. 'Weber: Selections in Translation' Cambridge University Press, 1991. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Max Weber]]|''The Nature of Social Action'' 1922}}

Both Weber and [[Georg Simmel]] pioneered the "''[[Verstehen]]''" (or 'interpretative') method in social science; a systematic process by which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Kaern, Phillips &amp; Cohen. (1990) ''Georg Simmel and Contemporary Sociology''. Springer Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-7923-0407-4}}. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the work of Simmel, in particular, sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand, deterministic systems of structural law. Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[existentialism|existential]] writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt; His sociology engaged in a neo-Kantian inquiry into the limits of perception, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?'&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) ''Simmel: On individuality and social forms'' Chicago University Press, 1971. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Simmel 01.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Georg Simmel]]]]
{{Quote|The deepest problems of modern life flow from the attempt of the individual to maintain the independence and individuality of his existence against the sovereign powers of society, against the weight of the historical heritage and the external culture and technique of life. The antagonism represents the most modern form of the conflict which primitive man must carry on with nature for his own bodily existence. The eighteenth century may have called for liberation from all the ties which grew up historically in politics, in religion, in morality and in economics in order to permit the original natural virtue of man, which is equal in everyone, to develop without inhibition; the nineteenth century may have sought to promote, in addition to man's freedom, his individuality (which is connected with the division of labor) and his achievements which make him unique and indispensable but which at the same time make him so much the more dependent on the complementary activity of others; Nietssche may have seen the relentless struggle of the individual as the prerequisite for his full development, while socialism found the same thing in the suppression of all competition&amp;nbsp;– but in each of these the same fundamental motive was at work, namely the resistance of the individual to being leveled, swallowed up in the social-technological mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, Georg ''The Metropolis and Mental Life'' in Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Georg Simmel]]|''[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]'' 1903}}

==Theoretical traditions==
{{Main|Sociological theory}}

===Classical theory===
The contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic&lt;ref name="Abend"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Abend|first = Gabriel |date = June 2008|title =The Meaning of 'Theory'|journal = Sociological Theory|volume = 26|number = 2|url = https://tirl.org/pc/readings/abend--meaning-of-theory.pdf |publisher = American Sociological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of the contentions of classical social theory. In [[Randall Collins]]' well-cited survey of sociological theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/clc/1820705|title=library.wur.nl|last=Collins|first=R.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0195087024|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steven E. Barkan |authorlink=Steven Barkan|title=Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World, Brief Edition |chapter=Theoretical Perspectives in Sociology |url=http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2?e=barkbrief-ch01_s03 |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural ([[Georg Simmel|Simmel]]) and [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] ([[George Herbert Mead|Mead]], [[Charles Cooley|Cooley]]) theories of social interaction. [[Utilitarianism]], also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with [[economics]], is an established tradition within sociological theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael Hechter |author2=Satoshi Kanazawa |title=Sociological Rational Choice Theory |journal=Annu. Rev. Sociol. |year=1997 |volume=23 |pages=191–214 |jstor=2952549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, James S., and Thomas J. Fararo. ''Rational choice theory''. New York: Sage (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, as argued by [[Raewyn Connell]], a tradition that is often forgotten is that of [[Social Darwinism]], which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raewyn Connell |title=Southern theory: the global dynamics of knowledge in social science |year=2007 |publisher=Polity |isbn=978-0745642482 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZ_rAAAAMAAJ}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reconstructing the History of Sociological Theory |author=Roscoe C. Hinkle |journal=Mid-American Review of Sociology |year=1982 |volume=VII |issue=1|pages=37–53 |url=https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/4915/1/MARSV7N1A3.pdf |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Lester F. Ward]] and [[William Graham Sumner]]. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.

====Functionalism====
{{Main|Structural functionalism}}
A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and [[anthropology]], functionalism addresses the [[social structure]], referred to as [[social organization]] in among the classical theorists, as a whole and regarding the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by [[Herbert Spencer]]) is to regard [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[institution]]s as 'organs' that work towards the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society.&lt;ref name="Sociology beyond societies: mobilities for the twenty-first century"/&gt; The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Radcliffe-Brown]]. It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eric Porth |author2=Kimberley Neutzling |author3=Jessica Edwards |url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=Functionalism |publisher=Department of Anthropology College of Arts and Sciences The University of Alabama |title=Anthropological Theories: A Guide Prepared by Students for Students: Anthropological theories: Functionalism |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of [[social evolutionism]], in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization. As [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] states: "Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analysing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation. functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giddens |first=Anthony |chapter=The Constitution of Society |title=The Giddens Reader |editor=Philip Cassell |publisher= MacMillan Press |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conflict theory====
{{Main|Conflict theory}}
Functionalist theories emphasize "cohesive systems" and are often contrasted with "conflict theories", which critique the overarching socio-political system or emphasize the inequality between particular groups. The following quotes from Durkheim and Marx epitomize the political, as well as theoretical, disparities, between functionalist and conflict thought respectively:

{{Quotation|To aim for a civilisation beyond that made possible by the nexus of the surrounding environment will result in unloosing sickness into the very society we live in. Collective activity cannot be encouraged beyond the point set by the condition of the social organism without undermining health.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile ''The Division of Labor in Society'' [1893] LA Coser: New York: The Free Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;|Émile Durkheim|''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' 1893}}

{{Quotation|The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Engels, ''The Communist Manifesto'', introduction by Martin Malia (New York: Penguin group, 1998), p. 35 {{ISBN|0-451-52710-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Karl Marx]] &amp; [[Friedrich Engels]]|''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' 1848}}

====Symbolic Interactionism====
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism|Dramaturgy (sociology)|Interpretive sociology|Phenomenological sociology}}
[[Symbolic interaction]]; often associated with [[Interactionism]], [[Phenomenological sociology]], [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|Dramaturgy]], [[Antipositivism|Interpretivism]], is a sociological tradition that places emphasis on subjective meanings and the empirical unfolding of social processes, generally accessed through micro-analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, John J. (2012). Sociology 14th Edition. Boston: Pearson. p. 16. {{ISBN|978-0-205-11671-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition emerged in the [[Chicago School (sociology)|''Chicago School'']] of the 1920s and 1930s, which prior to World War II "had been ''the'' center of sociological research and graduate study".&lt;ref name="Second Chicago School"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Second Chicago School?: The Development of a Postwar American Sociology |editor=Gary Alan Fine |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1995 |isbn=9780226249384 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SIZog56cAHEC&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=A%20Second%20Chicago%20School%3F%20&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Second%20Chicago%20School?&amp;f=false}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society as the product of the everyday interactions of individuals. Society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another. This approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand. Therefore, society is a complex, ever-changing mosaic of subjective meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=19 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation, and disregards the effects that culture, race or gender (i.e. social-historical structures) may have in that situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some important sociologists associated with this approach include [[Max Weber]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[George Homans]] and [[Peter Blau]]. It is also in this tradition that the radical-empirical approach of [[Ethnomethodology]] emerges from the work of [[Harold Garfinkel]].

====Utilitarianism====
{{Main| Utilitarianism|Rational choice theory|Exchange theory}}

Utilitarianism is often referred to as [[exchange theory]] or [[rational choice theory]] in the context of sociology. This tradition tends to privilege the agency of individual rational actors and assumes that within interactions individuals always seek to maximize their own self-interest. As argued by [[Josh Whitford]], rational actors are assumed to have four basic elements, the individual has (1) "a knowledge of alternatives," (2) "a knowledge of, or beliefs about the consequences of the various alternatives," (3) "an ordering of preferences over outcomes," (4) "A decision rule, to select among the possible alternatives"&lt;ref&gt;"Pragmatism and the untenable dualism of means and ends: Why rational choice theory does not deserve paradigmatic privilege" ''Theory and Society'' 31 (2002): 325–363.&lt;/ref&gt; Exchange theory is specifically attributed to the work of [[George C. Homans]], [[Peter Blau]] and [[Richard Emerson]].&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, R. M. "Social Exchange Theory." ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 2.1 (1976): 335–362.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational sociologists [[James G. March]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] noted that an individual's [[bounded rationality|rationality is bounded]] by the context or organizational setting. The utilitarian perspective in sociology was, most notably, revitalized in the late 20th century by the work of former [[American Sociological Association|ASA]] president [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]].

===20th-century social theory===
Following the decline of theories of sociocultural evolution, in the United States, the interactionism of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] dominated American sociology. As [[Anselm Strauss]] describes, "We didn't think symbolic interaction was a perspective in sociology; we thought it was sociology."&lt;ref name="Second Chicago School"/&gt; After World War II, mainstream sociology shifted to the survey-research of [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] at [[Columbia University]] and the general theorizing of [[Pitirim Sorokin]], followed by [[Talcott Parsons]] at [[Harvard University]]. Ultimately, "the failure of the Chicago, Columbia, and Wisconsin [sociology] departments to produce a significant number of graduate students interested in and committed to general theory in the years 1936–45 was to the advantage of the Harvard department."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Developments in American Sociological Theory, 1915–1950 |author=Roscoe C. Hinkle |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=9781438406770 |page=335 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VY5jI2pVTgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA335#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Parsons began to dominate general theory, his work predominately referenced European sociology—almost entirely omitting citations of both the American tradition of sociocultural-evolution as well as pragmatism. In addition to Parsons' revision of the sociological canon (which included Marshall, Pareto, Weber and Durkheim), the lack of theoretical challenges from other departments nurtured the rise of the Parsonian structural-functionalist movement, which reached its crescendo in the 1950s, but by the 1960s was in rapid decline.&lt;ref name="Coakley"/&gt;

By the 1980s, most functionalisms in Europe had broadly been replaced by [[conflict theory|conflict]]-oriented approaches&lt;ref name="Slattery"/&gt; and to many in the discipline, functionalism was considered "as dead as a dodo."&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; "According to Giddens, the orthodox consensus terminated in the late 1960s and 1970s as the middle ground shared by otherwise competing perspectives gave way and was replaced by a baffling variety of competing perspectives. This third 'generation' of social theory includes phenomenologically inspired approaches, critical theory, ethnomethodology, symbolic interactionism, structuralism, post-structuralism, and theories written in the tradition of hermeneutics and ordinary language philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Philip ''The Giddens Reader'' (1993) The Macmillan Press Ltd, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pax Wisconsana====
While some conflict approaches also gained popularity in the United States, the mainstream of the discipline instead shifted to a variety of empirically oriented [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theories]] with no single overarching, or "grand", theoretical orientation. [[John Levi Martin]] refers to this "golden age of methodological unity and theoretical calm" as the ''[[Pax Wisconsana]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=John Levi|title=The Explanation of Social Action|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it reflected the composition of the sociology department at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]: numerous scholars working on separate projects with little contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sacred Project of American Sociology |author=Christian Smith |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |page=142 |isbn=9780199377145 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8l6yAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Pax%20Wisconsana%20john%20levi%20martin&amp;pg=PA142#v=onepage&amp;q=Pax%20Wisconsana%20john%20levi%20martin&amp;f=false |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Omar Lizardo]] describes the ''Pax Wisconsana'' as: "a Midwestern flavored, [[Robert K. Merton|Mertonian]] resolution of the theory/method wars in which [sociologists] all agreed on at least two working hypotheses: (1) [[grand theory]]' is a waste of time; (2) [and] good theory has to be good to think with or goes in the trash bin."&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.nd.edu/~olizardo/syllabi/SOC63922-syllabus-spring11.pdf{{Dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the aversion to grand theory in the later half of the 20th century, several new traditions have emerged that propose various syntheses: structuralism, post-structuralism, cultural sociology and systems theory.

====Structuralism====
[[File:Anthony Giddens at the Progressive Governance Converence, Budapest, Hungary, 2004 October.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Anthony Giddens]]]]

The [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] movement originated primarily from the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. [[Anthony Giddens]]' theory of structuration draws on the [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the [[semiotic]] understanding of human culture as a [[sign (semiotics)|system of signs]]. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Assiter, A 1984, "Althusser and structuralism", ''The British journal of sociology'', vol. 35, no. 2, Blackwell Publishing, pp. 272–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second tradition of structuralist thought, contemporaneous with Giddens, emerges from the American school of social network analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jonathan H. Turner |title=The Structure of Sociological Theory |edition=Fifth |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company |location=Belmont, California |url=https://people.uvawise.edu/pww8y/Supplement/TMSup/Turner%20StrucSociTh%201991/27Turner%20StrucSociTh%20NetwkAn.pdf |accessdate=18 December 2014}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; spearheaded by the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations]] led by [[Harrison White]] and his students in the 1970s and 1980s. This tradition of structuralist thought argues that, rather than semiotics, social structure is networks of patterned social relations. And, rather than Levi-Strauss, this school of thought draws on the notions of structure as theorized by Levi-Strauss' contemporary anthropologist, [[Radcliffe-Brown]].&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"&gt;Lizardo, Omar. "Beyond the antinomies of structure: Levi-Strauss, Giddens, Bourdieu, and Sewell." ''Theory and society'' 39.6 (2010): 651–688.&lt;/ref&gt; Some&lt;ref&gt;Fararo, Thomas J., and Carter T. Butts. "Advances in generative structuralism: structured agency and multilevel dynamics." ''Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' 24.1 (1999): 1–65.&lt;/ref&gt; refer to this as "network structuralism," and equate it to "British structuralism" as opposed to the "French structuralism" of Levi-Strauss.

====Post-structuralism====
[[Post-structuralist]] thought has tended to [[antihumanism|reject 'humanist' assumptions]] in the conduct of social [[theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony "The Constitution of Society" in ''The Giddens Reader'' Philip Cassell (eds.) MacMillan Press p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]] provides a potent critique in his ''[[the Order of Things|Archaeology of the Human Sciences]]'', though Habermas and [[Richard Rorty|Rorty]] have both argued that Foucault merely replaces one such system of thought with another.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas. ''Taking Aim at the Heart of the Present'' in Hoy, D (eds) ''Foucault: A critical reader'' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rorty. ''Foucault and Epistemology'' in Hoy, D (eds) ''Foucault: A critical reader'' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The dialogue between these intellectuals highlights a trend in recent years for certain schools of sociology and philosophy to intersect. The [[anti-humanist]] position has been associated with "[[postmodernism]]", a term used in specific contexts to describe an ''era'' or ''phenomena'', but occasionally construed as a ''method''.

==Central theoretical problems==
Overall, there is a strong consensus regarding the central problems of sociological theory, which are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions. This consensus is: how to link, transcend or cope with the following "big three" dichotomies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret S. Archer |author2=Jonathan Q. Tritt |editor=Jonathan Q. Tritter |title=Rational Choice Theory: Resisting Colonisation |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-0415242714 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQbjnVBKRAkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=editions%3AW22YGhd2I3YC&amp;pg=PP1#v=snippet&amp;q=otherwise%20cope%20with%20the%20dichotomies%20represented%20by%20'subjectivism%20and%20objectivism',%20'agency%20and%20structure'%20&amp;f=false }}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[subjectivity and objectivity]], [[structure and agency]], and [[synchrony and diachrony]]. The first deals with ''knowledge'', the second with ''action'', and the last with ''time''. Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso and macro-scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems.

===Subjectivity and objectivity===
{{Main|Objectivity (science)|Objectivity (philosophy)|Subjectivity}}

The problem of subjectivity and objectivity can be divided into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand, the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is ''[[intersubjectivity]]'' achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description [[in situ]].

The latter concern with scientific knowledge results from the fact that a sociologist is part of the very object they seek to explain. Bourdieu puts this problem rather succinctly:{{Peacock term|date=August 2016}}

{{quote| How can the sociologist effect in practice this radical doubting which is indispensable for bracketing all the presuppositions inherent in the fact that she is a social being, that she is therefore socialised and led to feel "like a fish in water" within that social world whose structures she has internalised? How can she prevent the social world itself from carrying out the construction of the object, in a sense, through her, through these unself-conscious operations or operations unaware of themselves of which she is the apparent subject| Pierre Bourdieu|"The Problem of Reflexive Sociology" in ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology'',1992, pg 235}}

===Structure and agency===
{{Main|Structure and agency}}
Structure and agency, sometimes referred to as determinism versus voluntarism,&lt;ref name="ArcherArcher1995"&gt;{{cite book|first=Margaret Scotford |last= Archer|title=Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMbNRp5EseMC&amp;pg=PA65|date=19 October 1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48442-8|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" In this context '[[agency (sociology)|agency]]' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas '[[social structure|structure]]' relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological [[epistemology]] ("What is the social world made of?", "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?").&lt;ref name="The Constitution of Society"/&gt; A perennial question within this debate is that of "[[social reproduction]]": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals?

===Synchrony and diachrony===
Synchrony and diachrony, or statics and dynamics, within social theory are terms that refer to a distinction emerging out of the work of [[Levi-Strauss]] who inherited it from the linguistics of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"/&gt; The former slices moments of time for analysis, thus it is an analysis of static social reality. Diachrony, on the other hand, attempts to analyse dynamic sequences. Following Saussure, synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a ''language'', while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual ''speech''. In Anthony Giddens' introduction to ''Central Problems in Social Theory'', he states that, "in order to show the interdependence of action and structure ... we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction." And like structure and agency, time is integral to discussion of [[social reproduction]]. In terms of sociology, historical sociology is often better positioned to analyse social life as diachronic, while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronized. Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim.&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"/&gt; Nonetheless, the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data.

==Research methodology==
{{Main|Social research}}
Many people divide sociological research methods into two broad categories, although many others see research methods as a continuum:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bamberger|first1=Michael|title=Opportunities and Challenges for Integrating Quantitative and Qualitative Research |url= http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDERTRANSPORT/Resources/quantitative_qualitative.htm|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Quantitative method|Quantitative designs]] approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims
* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative designs]] emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality

Many sociologists are divided into camps of support for particular research techniques. These disputes relate to the epistemological debates at the historical core of social theory. While very different in many aspects, both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between [[social theory|theory]] and data.&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt; Quantitative methodologies hold the dominant position in sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; In the discipline's two most cited journals, quantitative articles have historically outnumbered qualitative ones by a factor of two.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt; (Most articles published in the largest British journal, on the other hand, are [[Qualitative research|qualitative]].) Most textbooks on the methodology of social research are written from the quantitative perspective,&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt; and the very term "methodology" is often used synonymously with "[[statistics]]." Practically all sociology PhD programmes in the United States require training in statistical methods. The work produced by quantitative researchers is also deemed more 'trustworthy' and 'unbiased' by the greater public,&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt; though this judgment continues to be challenged by antipositivists.&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;

The choice of method often depends largely on what the researcher intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a [[Survey research|survey questionnaire]] to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's [[social actions]] may choose ethnographic [[participant observation]] or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or [[triangulation (social science)|'triangulate']], quantitative ''and'' qualitative methods as part of a 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]].&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt;

===Sampling===
[[File:Planche de Galton.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The [[bean machine]], designed by early social research methodologist Sir [[Francis Galton]] to demonstrate the [[normal distribution]], which is important to much quantitative [[hypothesis testing]].]]
Quantitative methods are often used to ask questions about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete [[enumeration]] of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable [[subset]] of a [[Statistical population|population]]. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw [[inference]]s from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as [[sampling (statistics)|'sampling']]. While it is usually best to [[random sampling|sample randomly]], concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for [[stratified sampling]]. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates [[nonprobability sampling]], such as [[convenience sampling]] or [[snowball sampling]].&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt;

===Methods===
''The following list of research methods is neither exclusive nor exhaustive:''
* [[Archival research]] or the [[Historical method]]: draws upon the [[secondary data]] located in historical archives and records, such as biographies, memoirs, journals, and so on.
* [[Content analysis]]: The content of interviews and other texts is systematically analysed. Often data is 'coded' as a part of the '[[grounded theory]]' approach using qualitative data analysis (QDA) software, such as [[Atlas.ti]], [[MAXQDA]], [[NVivo]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Patricia Yancey, Turner, Barry A.. (1986). "Grounded Theory and Organisational Research". ''The Journal of Applied Behavioural Science'', 22(2), 141. Retrieved 21 June 2009, from ABI/INFORM Global database. (Document ID: 1155984).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[QDA Miner]].
* [[Experimental research]]: The researcher isolates a single social process and reproduces it in a laboratory (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking to determine whether or not certain social [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]] can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting [[gender stereotype]]s).&lt;ref name="Jost"/&gt; Participants are [[Random assignment|randomly assigned]] to different groups that either serve as [[Scientific control|controls]]—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.
* [[Longitudinal study]]: An extensive examination of a specific person or group over a long period of time.
* [[Observation]]: Using data from the senses, the researcher records information about social phenomenon or behaviour. Observation techniques may or may not feature participation. In [[participant observation]], the researcher goes into the field (such as a community or a place of work), and participates in the activities of the field for a prolonged period of time in order to acquire a deep understanding of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=42 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data acquired through these techniques may be analysed either quantitatively or qualitatively.  In the observation research, a sociologist might study [[global warming]] in some part of the world that is less populated.
* [[Survey research]]: The researcher gathers data using interviews, questionnaires, or similar feedback from a set of people sampled from a particular population of interest. Survey items from an interview or questionnaire may be open-ended or closed-ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=40 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from surveys is usually analysed statistically on a computer.

===Computational sociology===
[[File:Sna large.png|thumb|upright=0.75|left|A [[social network]] diagram: individuals (or 'nodes') connected by relationships]]
{{Main|Computational sociology}}
Sociologists increasingly draw upon computationally intensive methods to analyse and model social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007 |title=Computational Sociology |last=Bainbridge |first=William Sims |encyclopedia=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology |publisher=Blackwell Reference Online |url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/subscriber/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-85 |doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x |editor=Ritzer, George|isbn=978-1-4051-2433-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[computer simulation]]s, [[artificial intelligence]], [[text mining]], complex statistical methods, and new analytic approaches like [[social network]] analysis and [[social sequence analysis]], computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modelling of social interactions.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

Although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or [[computer science]], several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as [[physics]] and artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name="Artificial Societies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooperation"/&gt; By the same token, some of the approaches that originated in computational sociology have been imported into the natural sciences, such as measures of [[centrality|network centrality]] from the fields of social network analysis and [[network science]]. In relevant literature, computational sociology is often related to the study of [[social complexity]].&lt;ref name="The Computer as Laboratory: Toward a Theory of Complex Adaptive Systems"/&gt; Social complexity concepts such as [[complex systems]], [[non-linear]] interconnection among macro and micro process, and [[emergence]], have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology.&lt;ref name="Methodological Implications of Complex Systems Approaches to Sociality: Simulation as a Foundation for Knowledge"/&gt; A practical and well-known example is the construction of a computational model in the form of an "[[artificial society]]", by which researchers can analyse the structure of a social system.&lt;ref name="SfSS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Generative"/&gt;

==Scope and topics==
{{Main|Outline of sociology}}

===Culture===
[[File:AdornoHorkheimerHabermasbyJeremyJShapiro2.png|thumb|right|[[Max Horkheimer]] (left, front), [[Theodor Adorno]] (right, front), and [[Jürgen Habermas]] (right, back) 1965]]
{{Main|Sociology of culture|Cultural studies}}
Sociologists' approach to culture can be divided into a "sociology of culture" and "cultural sociology"—the terms are similar, though not entirely interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2006/08/27/the-sociology-of-culture-versus-cultural-sociology/|title=the sociology of culture versus cultural sociology|website=orgtheory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of culture is an older term, and considers some topics and objects as more-or-less "cultural" than others. Conversely, cultural sociology sees all social phenomena as inherently cultural.&lt;ref name="umn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/ |title=Sociology of Culture and Cultural Sociology |publisher=blog.lib.umn.edu |accessdate=4 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505182344/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/ |archivedate=5 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociology of culture often attempts to explain certain cultural phenomena as a product of social processes, while cultural sociology sees culture as a potential explanation of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwQPS4H3aVcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Cultures%20and%20Societies%20in%20a%20Changing%20World&amp;pg=PT26#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20sociology&amp;f=false|title=Cultures and Societies in a Changing World|publisher=|isbn=9781412990547|author1=Griswold|first1=Wendy|date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt; While early theorists such as [[Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss|Mauss]] were influential in [[cultural anthropology]], sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for [[Modernity|modern]] (rather than [[Primitive culture|primitive]] or ancient) society. Cultural sociology often involves the [[hermeneutic]] analysis of words, artefacts and symbols, or ethnographic interviews. However, some sociologists employ historical-comparative or quantitative techniques in the analysis of culture, Weber and Bourdieu for instance. The subfield is sometimes allied with [[critical theory]] in the vein of [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and other members of the [[Frankfurt School]]. Loosely distinct from the sociology of culture is the field of [[cultural studies]]. [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School]] theorists such as [[Richard Hoggart]] and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] questioned the division between "producers" and "consumers" evident in earlier theory, emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts. Cultural Studies aims to examine its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power. For example, a study of a [[subculture]] (such as white working class youth in London) would consider the social practices of the group as they relate to the dominant class. The "[[cultural turn]]" of the 1960s ultimately placed culture much higher on the sociological agenda.

====Art, music and literature====
{{Main|Sociology of literature|Sociology of art|Sociology of film|Sociology of music}}
Sociology of literature, film, and art is a subset of the sociology of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 ''Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire'', translated by Susan Emanuel as ''Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'' (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.

===Criminality, deviance, law and punishment===
{{Main|Criminology|Sociology of law|Sociology of punishment|Deviance (sociology)|Social disorganization theory}}
Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, and control of criminal activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, [[psychology]], and the [[behavioural sciences]]. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; and how they are enforced. The concept of [[social disorganization]] is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, [[Robert K. Merton]] produced a [[Robert K. Merton#Merton's theory of deviance|typology of deviance]], which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.&lt;ref name="Robert K. Merton Remembered"/&gt;

====Sociology of law====
The study of law played a significant role in the formation of classical sociology. Durkheim famously described law as the "visible symbol" of social solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar, Reza (2009) "Law Through Sociology's Looking Glass: Conflict and Competition in Sociological Studies of Law" in "The new ISA handbook in contemporary international sociology: Conflict, Competition, and Cooperation", Ann Denis, Devorah Kalekin-Fishman, eds., (London: Sage). An e-copy available at [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1327025 papers.ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of law refers to both a sub-discipline of sociology and an approach within the field of legal studies. Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with other aspects of society, such as the development of legal [[institution]]s and the effect of laws on social change and vice versa. For example, an influential recent work in the field relies on statistical analyses to argue that the increase in incarceration in the US over the last 30 years is due to changes in law and policing and not to an increase in crime; and that this increase significantly contributes to maintaining racial [[Social stratification|stratification]].&lt;ref name="Western"/&gt;

===Communications and information technologies===
The [[sociology of communications]] and information technologies includes "the social aspects of computing, the Internet, new media, computer networks, and other communication and information technologies".&lt;ref name="asanet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/CIT.cfm|title=American Sociological Association: Communication and Information Technology Section|publisher=asanet.org|accessdate=4 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402230046/http://www.asanet.org/sections/CIT.cfm|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internet and digital media====
{{Main|Sociology of the Internet|Digital sociology}}
The Internet is of interest to sociologists in various ways; most practically as a tool for [[social research|research]] and as a discussion platform.&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Wilson, Researching Sociology on the Internet, [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2004, {{ISBN|0-534-62437-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sociology of the Internet]] in the broad sense regards the analysis of [[online communities]] (e.g. [[newsgroup]]s, social networking sites) and [[virtual world]]s, thus there is often overlap with [[community sociology]]. Online communities may be studied statistically through [[social network|network analysis]] or interpreted qualitatively through [[virtual ethnography]]. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through [[new media]], thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an [[industrial society|industrial]] to an [[informational society]]. One notable text is [[Manuel Castells]]' ''[[The Internet Galaxy]]''—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Internet Galaxy, Reflections on the Internet, Business and Society. Oxford, Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related to the sociology of the Internet, is [[digital sociology]], which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since the first decade of the twenty-first century.

====Media====
{{Main|Media studies}}
As with [[cultural studies]], media study is a distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, [[literary criticism]] and [[critical theory]]. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms is not in the remit of sociologists, analyses of [[socialization|socializing]] factors, such as [[ideology|ideological effects]] and [[audience reception]], stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline ''per se'', but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.

===Economic sociology===
{{Main|Economic sociology}}
The term "economic sociology" was first used by [[William Stanley Jevons]] in 1879, later to be coined in the works of Durkheim, Weber and Simmel between 1890 and 1920.&lt;ref name="princeton1"/&gt; Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, emphasizing class relations and [[modernity]] as a philosophical concept. The relationship between [[capitalism]] and [[modernity]] is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905) and Simmel's ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' (1900). The contemporary period of economic sociology, also known as ''new economic sociology'', was consolidated by the 1985 work of [[Mark Granovetter]] titled "Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness". This work elaborated the concept of [[embeddedness]], which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations (and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part). [[Social network|Social network analysis]] has been the primary methodology for studying this phenomenon. Granovetter's theory of the [[Mark Granovetter#The strength of weak ties|strength of weak ties]] and [[Ronald Burt]]'s concept of structural holes are two best known theoretical contributions of this field.

====Work, employment, and industry====
{{Main|Industrial sociology|sociology of work|Industrial relations}}
The sociology of work, or industrial sociology, examines "the direction and implications of trends in [[technological]] change, [[globalization]], labour markets, work organization, [[managerial]] practices and [[division of labour|employment relations]] to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge, resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Tony J. 2008 ''Sociology, Work, and Industry''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-43555-2}}. p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Sociology of education}}
The sociology of education is the study of how educational institutions determine social structures, experiences, and other outcomes. It is particularly concerned with the schooling systems of modern industrial societies.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; A classic 1966 study in this field by [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]], known as the "Coleman Report", analysed the performance of over 150,000 students and found that student background and socioeconomic status are much more important in determining educational outcomes than are measured differences in school resources (''i.e.'' per pupil spending).&lt;ref name="Hanushek"/&gt; The controversy over "school effects" ignited by that study has continued to this day. The study also found that socially disadvantaged black students profited from schooling in racially mixed classrooms, and thus served as a catalyst for [[desegregation busing]] in American public schools.

===Environment===
{{Main|Environmental sociology|Sociology of disaster}}

Environmental sociology is the study of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become ''defined'' and ''known'' to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist [[John Bellamy Foster]], the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the [[metabolic rift]], which influenced contemporary thought on [[sustainability]]. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the [[sociology of risk]], [[rural sociology]] and the [[sociology of disaster]].

====Human ecology====
{{Main|Human ecology|Architectural sociology|Visual sociology|Sociology of space}}

Human ecology deals with interdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. In addition to Environmental sociology, this field overlaps with [[architectural sociology]], [[urban sociology]], and to some extent [[visual sociology]]. In turn, visual sociology—which is concerned with all visual dimensions of social life—overlaps with media studies in that it uses photography, film and other technologies of media.

====Social pre-wiring====
Social pre-wiring deals with the study of fetal social behavior and social interactions in a multi-fetal environment. Specifically, social pre-wiring refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 2951360|year = 2010|last1 = Castiello|first1 = U.|title = Wired to be Social: The Ontogeny of Human Interaction|journal = PLOS ONE|volume = 5|issue = 10|pages = e13199|last2 = Becchio|first2 = C.|last3 = Zoia|first3 = S.|last4 = Nelini|first4 = C.|last5 = Sartori|first5 = L.|last6 = Blason|first6 = L.|last7 = d'Ottavio|first7 = G.|last8 = Bulgheroni|first8 = M.|last9 = Gallese|first9 = V.|pmid = 20949058|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behavior]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behavior]]s that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behavior]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;

===Family, gender, and sexuality===
{{Main|Sociology of the family|Sociology of childhood|Sociology of gender|Feminist sociology|Feminist theory|Queer theory}}
[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|"[[Rosie the Riveter]]" was an iconic symbol of the American [[United States home front during World War II|homefront]] and a departure from [[gender roles]] due to wartime necessity.]]
Family, gender and sexuality form a broad area of inquiry studied in many sub-fields of sociology. A family is a group of people who are related by kinship ties :- Relations of blood / marriage / civil partnership or adoption. The family unit is one of the most important social institutions found in some form in nearly all known societies. It is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an [[institution]] and unit of [[socialization]], with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the [[nuclear family]] and its distinct [[gender roles]]. The notion of "[[childhood]]" is also significant. As one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives, the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula. [[Feminist sociology]], on the other hand, is a normative sub-field that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality, particularly with respect to power and inequality. The primary concern of [[feminist theory]] is the [[patriarchy]] and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies, both at the level of small-scale interaction and in terms of the broader social structure. [[Feminist sociology]] also analyses how gender interlocks with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Bose, Christine. 2012. "Intersectionality and Global Gender Inequality" Gender &amp; Society 26(1): 67–72&lt;/ref&gt; "How to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods" is also a concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Role of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | date = February 2001 | first = Kevin S. | last = Seybold |author2=Peter C. Hill | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–24 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology]] of gender, on the other hand, uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification. For example, one recent study has shown that resume evaluators penalize women for motherhood while giving a boost to men for fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Correll, Shelley, Stephen Benard, In Paik. 2007. "Getting a job: Is there a motherhood penalty?" American Journal of Sociology 112: 1297–1338.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health, illness, and the body===
{{Main|Sociology of health and illness|Medical sociology}}
The [[sociology of health and illness]] focuses on the social effects of, and public attitudes toward, [[illness]]es, diseases, [[mental health]] and [[disabilities]]. This sub-field also overlaps with [[gerontology]] and the study of the [[ageing]] process. Medical sociology, by contrast, focuses on the inner-workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944).&lt;ref name="British Sociological Association: Medical Sociology"/&gt;

The [[Sociology of the body|sociology of the body and embodiment]]&lt;ref name="asanet2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/body-embodiment.cfm#|title=American Sociological Association:|publisher=asanet.org|accessdate=4 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418132652/http://www.asanet.org/sections/body-embodiment.cfm|archivedate=18 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes a broad perspective on the idea of "the body" and includes "a wide range of embodied dynamics including human and non-human bodies, morphology, human reproduction, anatomy, body fluids, biotechnology, genetics. This often intersects with health and illness, but also theories of bodies as political, social, cultural, economic and ideological productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britsoc.co.uk/study-groups/ageing,-body-society.aspx |title=The British Sociological Association |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162250/http://www.britsoc.co.uk/study-groups/ageing%2C-body-society.aspx |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Sociological Association|ISA]] maintains a Research Committee devoted to "The Body in the Social Sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/rc54.htm|title=ISA - Research Committee on the Body in the Social Sciences RC54|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Death, dying, bereavement====
A subfield of the sociology of health and illness that overlaps with cultural sociology is the study of death, dying and bereavement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britsoc.co.uk/study-groups/social-aspects-of-death,-dying-and-bereavement.aspx|title=The British Sociological Association|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714122235/http://www.britsoc.co.uk/study-groups/social-aspects-of-death%2C-dying-and-bereavement.aspx|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to broadly as the [[sociology of death]]. This topic is exemplifed by the work of [[Douglas Davies]] and [[Michael C. Kearl]].

===Knowledge and science===
{{Main|Sociology of knowledge|Sociology of scientific knowledge|Sociology of the history of science|Sociology of science}}
The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking theorists, most notably [[Max Scheler]], and [[Karl Mannheim]], wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]] in ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare ''[[socially constructed reality]]''). The "archaeological" and "genealogical" studies of [[Michel Foucault]] are of considerable contemporary influence.

The sociology of science involves the study of science as a social activity, especially dealing "with the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity."&lt;ref name="socofsci-bendavid"/&gt; Important theorists in the sociology of science include [[Robert K. Merton]] and [[Bruno Latour]]. These branches of sociology have contributed to the formation of [[science and technology studies]]. Both the [[American Sociological Association|ASA]] and the [[British Sociological Association|BSA]] have sections devoted to the subfield of Science, Knowledge and Technology.&lt;ref name="asanet3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/SKAT.cfm|title=American Sociological Association: Section on Science, Knowledge and Technology|publisher=asanet.org|accessdate=4 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321045626/http://www.asanet.org/sections/SKAT.cfm|archivedate=21 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britsoc.co.uk/study-groups/science-technology-studies.aspx|title=The British Sociological Association|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150113/http://www.britsoc.co.uk/study-groups/science-technology-studies.aspx|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Sociological Association|ISA]] maintains a Research Committee on Science and Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/rc23.htm|title=ISA - Research Committee on Sociology of Science and Technology RC23|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
{{Main|Sociology of leisure|Sociology of sport}}
Sociology of leisure is the study of how humans organize their free time. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as [[Sociology of sport|sport]], tourism, and the playing of games. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the sociology of work, as each explores a different side of the work–leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work–leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture. This area of sociology began with [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s ''Theory of the Leisure Class''.&lt;ref&gt;Lueschen, G. 1980. Sociology of Sport: Development, Present State, and Prospects. ''Annual Review of Sociology'', 6: 315–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace, war, and conflict===
{{Main|Peace and conflict studies|Military sociology|Sociology of terrorism}}
This subfield of sociology studies, broadly, the dynamics of war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions.&lt;ref name="asanet4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sectionpwsc/sectinfo.cfm|title=American Sociological Association: Section Information|publisher=asanet.org|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a subset of this subfield, [[military sociology]] aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group rather than as an [[Military organization|organization]]. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct [[social group|group]] with coerced [[collective action]] based on shared [[Advocacy group|interests]] linked to survival in [[vocation]] and [[combat]], with purposes and [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns [[civilian]]-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.&lt;ref name="Core Issues and Theory in Military Sociology"/&gt;

===Political sociology===
{{Main|Political sociology}}
[[File:JuergenHabermas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jürgen Habermas]]]]
Historically, political sociology concerned the relations between political organization and society. A typical research question in this area might be: "Why do so few American citizens choose to vote?"&lt;ref&gt;Piven, F. (1988) ''Why Americans Don't Vote: And Why Politicians Want it That Way'' Pantheon. {{ISBN|0-679-72318-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect questions of political opinion formation brought about some of the pioneering uses of statistical [[survey research]] by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]]. A major subfield of political sociology developed in relation to such questions, which draws on comparative history to analyse socio-political trends. The field developed from the work of Max Weber and [[Moisey Ostrogorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, S.M. ''Introduction: Ostrogorski and the Analytical Approach to the Comparative Study of Political Parties'' in M. Ostrogorski, Democracy and the Organisation of Political (2 vol, 1964; 1982 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary political sociology includes these areas of research, but it has been opened up to wider questions of power and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LWwBN3rUrO4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=contemporary+political+sociology |title=Contemporary Political Sociology: Globalization, Politics and Power |author=Kate Nash |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |isbn=9781444320770}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!-- unless the intent was the web page itself, in which case this should be {{cite web}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions in such a way as to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of [[social movements]] and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5mazSOSvqrEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+movements#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Social movements: an introduction&amp;nbsp;– Donatella Della Porta, Mario Diani |date= 9 February 2009|accessdate=4 November 2011|isbn=9781405148214|last1=Porta |first1=Donatella Della |last2=Diani |first2=Mario }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political sociology has also moved beyond [[methodological nationalism]] and analysed the role of non-governmental organizations, the diffusion of the nation-state throughout the Earth as a [[social construct]], and the role of [[Statelessness|stateless entities]] in the modern [[world society]]. Contemporary political sociologists also study inter-state interactions and [[human rights]].

===Population and demography===
{{Main|Demography|Human ecology|Mobilities}}

Demographers or sociologists of population study the size, composition and change over time of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study of population is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as [[Mobilities]] studies and is closely related to [[human geography]]. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or [[epidemiology]].

===Public sociology===
{{Main|Public sociology}}

Public sociology refers to an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a style of sociology rather than a particular method, theory, or set of political values. This approach is primarily associated with [[Michael Burawoy]] who contrasted it with professional sociology, a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public sociology is also part of the broader field of science communication or [[science journalism]]. In a distinct but similar vein,&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. ''Sociological Spectrum''. 36 (3): 183-190&lt;/ref&gt; [[applied sociology]], also known as [[clinical sociology]], [[policy sociology]] or [[sociological practice]], applies knowledge derived from sociological research to solve societal problems.

===Race and ethnic relations===
{{Main|Sociology of race and ethnic relations|Sociology of immigration}}
The sociology of race and of ethnic relations is the area of the discipline that studies the [[Social relation|social]], political, and economic relations between [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] and [[ethnicities]] at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of [[racism]], [[residential segregation]], and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as [[Social stratification|stratification]] and [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], as well as with [[postcolonial theory]]. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either [[assimilationism]] or [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Milton Louw&amp;nbsp;– Making A Better World." : Oldest Coloured Owned Business in Namibia. Web. 22 February 2012. &lt;http://milton-louw.blogspot.com/2011/03/oldest-coloured-owned-business-in.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-racism]] forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s.

===Religion===
{{Main|Sociology of religion}}
The sociology of religion concerns the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Christiano, et al., (2nd ed., 2008), Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments, Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-7425-6111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the [[philosophy of religion]] in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth-claims, instead assuming what [[Peter L. Berger]] has described as a position of "methodological atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: {{ISBN|0-385-07305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology ''began'' with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 [[suicide (book)|study of suicide]] rates among [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of [[economic sociology]] and [[social stratification]]: ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905), ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'' (1915), ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' (1915), and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' (1920). Contemporary debates often centre on topics such as [[secularization]], [[civil religion]], the intersection of religion and economics and the role of religion in a context of [[globalization]] and [[multiculturalism]].

===Social change and development===
{{Main|Social change| Development studies|Community development|International development}}

The sociology of change and development attempts to understand how societies develop and how they can be changed. This includes studying many different aspects of society, for example demographic trends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shackman|first1=Gene|last2=Wang|first2=Xun|last3=Liu|first3=Yalin|title=Brief Review of World Demographic Trends Summary|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1754255|website=SSRN|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; political or technological trends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silberglitt|first1=Richard|last2=Anton|first2=Philip|last3=Howell|first3=David|title=The Global Technology Revolution 2020, In-Depth Analyses Bio/Nano/Materials/Information Trends, Drivers, Barriers, and Social Implications|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR303.html|publisher=Rand|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or changes in culture. Within this field, sociologists often use [[macrosociology|macrosociological methods]] or [[Comparative historical research|historical-comparative methods]]. In contemporary studies of social change, there are overlaps with [[international development]] or [[community development]]. However, most of the founders of sociology had theories of social change based on their study of history. For instance, [[Marx]] contended that the material circumstances of society ultimately caused the ideal or cultural aspects of society, while [[Weber]] argued that it was in fact the cultural mores of Protestantism that ushered in a transformation of material circumstances. In contrast to both, [[Durkheim]] argued that societies moved from simple to complex through a process of [[sociocultural evolution]]. Sociologists in this field also study processes of globalization and imperialism. Most notably, [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] extends Marx's theoretical frame to include large spans of time and the entire globe in what is known as [[world systems theory]]. Development sociology is also heavily influenced by [[post-colonialism]]. In recent years, [[Raewyn Connell]] issued a critique of the bias in sociological research towards countries in the [[Global North]]. She argues that this bias blinds sociologists to the lived experiences of the [[Global South]], specifically, so-called, "Northern Theory" lacks an adequate theory of imperialism and colonialism.

There are many organizations studying social change, including the [[Fernand Braudel Center]] for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems, and Civilizations, and the [[Global Social Change Research Project]].

===Social networks===
[[File:Harrisonwhite.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Harrison White]]]]
{{Main|Social network|Social network analysis|Figurational Sociology|Relational sociology|Sociomapping}}
A social network is a [[social structure]] composed of individuals (or organizations) called "nodes", which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of [[interdependency]], such as [[friendship]], [[kinship]], financial exchange, dislike, [[sexual network|sexual relationships]], or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. An underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from non-local [[communities]] to networks of exchange. Drawing theoretically from [[relational sociology]], social network analysis avoids treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete units of analysis, it focuses instead on how the structure of ties affects and constitutes individuals and their relationships. In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behaviour, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms. On the other hand, recent research by [[Omar Lizardo]] also demonstrates that network ties are shaped and created by previously existing cultural tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last =Lizardo|first= Omar|title = How cultural tastes shape personal networks|journal = American Sociological Review|volume = 71|issue = 5 |date= October 2006|pages = 778–807|url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/25472427 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808142642/http://folders.nottingham.edu.cn/staff/zlizaw/Readings/Week%202/Lizardo%202006.pdf |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social network theory is usually defined in [[Mathematical sociology|formal mathematics]] and may include integration of geographical data into [[Sociomapping]].

===Social psychology===
{{Main|Social psychology (sociology)|Psychoanalytic sociology}}
Sociological social psychology focuses on micro-scale [[social actions]]. This area may be described as adhering to "sociological miniaturism", examining whole societies through the study of individual thoughts and emotions as well as behaviour of small groups.&lt;ref name="Sociological miniaturism: seeing the big through the small in social psychology"/&gt; Of special concern to psychological sociologists is how to explain a variety of demographic, social, and cultural facts in terms of human social interaction. Some of the major topics in this field are social inequality, [[group dynamics]], prejudice, aggression, social perception, group behaviour, social change, non-verbal behaviour, socialization, conformity, leadership, and social identity. Social psychology may be taught with [[Social psychology (psychology)|psychological emphasis]].&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; In sociology, researchers in this field are the most prominent users of the [[experiment|experimental method]] (however, unlike their psychological counterparts, they also frequently employ other methodologies). Social psychology looks at social influences, as well as social perception and social interaction.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;

===Stratification, poverty and inequality===
{{Main|Social stratification|Social inequality|Social mobility|Social class}}
Social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of individuals into social classes, [[caste]]s, and divisions within a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=225 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[Western culture|Western societies]] stratification traditionally relates to cultural and economic classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and [[Working class|lower class]], but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. [[occupational prestige|occupational]]).&lt;ref name="Social Class and Stratification"/&gt; Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of [[structural functionalism]] suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. [[Conflict theory|Conflict theorists]], by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of [[social mobility]] in stratified societies.

Karl Marx distinguished social classes by their connection to the [[means of production]] in the capitalist system: the [[bourgeoisie]] own the means, but this effectively includes the [[proletariat]] itself as the workers can only sell their own [[labour power]] (forming the [[base and superstructure|material base of the cultural superstructure]]). Max Weber critiqued Marxist [[economic determinism]], arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. [[patriarchy]]). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=243 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stark|first= Rodney|title=Sociology|year=2006|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|isbn=978-0-495-09344-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bourdieu]] provides a modern example in the concepts of [[cultural capital|cultural]] and [[symbolic capital]].

===Urban and rural sociology===
{{Main|Urban sociology|Rural sociology}}
Urban sociology involves the analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making. After the [[industrial revolution]], works such as [[Georg Simmel]]'s ''[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]'' (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilizing [[symbolic interactionism]] as a method of field research. Contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of [[globalization]], for instance, in [[Saskia Sassen]]'s study of the "[[Global city]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sassen | first = Saskia | title = The global city: New York, London, Tokyo | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2001 | origyear = 1991 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780691070636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural sociology, by contrast, is the analysis of non-metropolitan areas. As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists.

====Community sociology====
Often grouped with urban and rural sociology is that of community sociology or the sociology of community.&lt;ref name="asanet5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/CUS.cfm|title=American Sociological Association: Section on Community and Urban Sociology|publisher=asanet.org|accessdate=4 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315020313/http://asanet.org/sections/CUS.cfm|archivedate=15 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking various communities—including online communities—as the unit of analysis, community sociologists study the origin and effects of different associations of people. For instance, German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] distinguished between two types of human association: ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' (usually translated as "community") and ''[[Gesellschaft]]'' ("society" or "association"). In his 1887 work, ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Tönnies argued that ''Gemeinschaft'' is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a "unity of will".&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, F. 1887. ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'development' or 'health' of a community is also a central concern of community sociologists also engage in [[development sociology]], exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of [[social capital]].

==Other academic disciplines==
Sociology overlaps with a variety of disciplines that study society, in particular [[anthropology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[social work]] and [[social philosophy]]. Many comparatively new fields such as [[communication studies]], [[cultural studies]], [[demography]] and [[literary theory]], draw upon methods that originated in sociology. The terms "[[social science]]" and "[[social research]]" have both gained a degree of autonomy since their origination in classical sociology. The distinct field of [[social anthropology]] or anthroposociology is the dominant constituent of anthropology throughout the [[United Kingdom]] and Commonwealth and much of Europe ([[France]] in particular&lt;ref&gt;[http://cairn-int.info/abstract-E_ANSO_121_0093--cultural-anthropology-or-social-anthropo.htm#anchor_cite Dianteill, Erwan, "Cultural Anthropology or Social Anthropology? A Transatlantic Argument", L’Année sociologique 1/2012 (Vol. 62), p. 93-122].&lt;/ref&gt;), where it is distinguished from [[cultural anthropology]].&lt;ref name="UKAnthroBench"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/Publications/InformationAndGuidance/Documents/Anthropology07.pdf |title=Benchmark Statement Anthropology (UK) |publisher=QAA (UK) |date= |accessdate=2012-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921091757/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/Publications/InformationAndGuidance/Documents/Anthropology07.pdf |archive-date=21 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, social anthropology is commonly subsumed within cultural anthropology (or under the relatively new designation of [[sociocultural anthropology]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Sociology and [[applied sociology]] are connected to the professional and academic discipline of [[social work]].&lt;ref name="Web page"/&gt; Both disciplines study social interactions, community and the effect of various systems (i.e. family, school, community, laws, political sphere) on the individual.&lt;ref name="Generalist Practice with Organisations and Communities"/&gt; However, social work is generally more focused on practical strategies to alleviate social dysfunctions; sociology in general provides a thorough examination of the root causes of these problems.&lt;ref name="Direct Social Work Practice"/&gt; For example, a sociologist might study ''why'' a community is plagued with poverty. The [[applied sociology|applied sociologist]] would be more focused on practical strategies on ''what'' needs to be done to alleviate this burden. The social worker would be focused on ''action''; implementing theses strategies [[clinical social work|"directly"]] or [[Community practice|"indirectly"]] by means of [[mental health|mental health therapy]], [[counseling|counselling]], [[advocacy]], [[community organization]] or [[community mobilization]].&lt;ref name="Generalist Practice with Organisations and Communities"/&gt;

[[Social anthropology]] is the branch of [[anthropology]] that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in [[social group]]s. Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of [[social organization]]. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.&lt;ref name="James Trostle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Web page" /&gt;

[[Sociocultural anthropology]], which include [[linguistic anthropology]], is concerned with the problem of difference and similarity within and between human populations. The discipline arose concomitantly with the expansion of European colonial empires, and its practices and theories have been questioned and reformulated along with processes of decolonization. Such issues have re-emerged as transnational processes have challenged the centrality of the [[Nation state|nation-state]] to theorizations about culture and [[Power (social and political)|power]]. New challenges have emerged as public debates about [[multiculturalism]], and the increasing use of the culture concept outside of the academy and among peoples studied by anthropology. These times are not "business-as-usual" in the academy, in anthropology, or in the world, if ever there were such times.

[[Irving Louis Horowitz]], in his ''The Decomposition of Sociology'' (1994), has argued that the discipline, while arriving from a "distinguished lineage and tradition", is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making: "The decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking, and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt; Furthermore: "A problem yet unmentioned is that sociology's malaise has left all the social sciences vulnerable to pure positivism—to an empiricism lacking any theoretical basis. Talented individuals who might, in an earlier time, have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business, law, the natural sciences, and even creative writing; this drains sociology of much needed potential."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt; Horowitz cites the lack of a 'core discipline' as exacerbating the problem. [[Randall Collins]], the [[Dorothy Swaine Thomas]] Professor in Sociology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and a member of the Advisory Editors Council of the [[Social Evolution &amp; History]] journal, has voiced similar sentiments: "we have lost all coherence as a discipline, we are breaking up into a conglomerate of specialities, each going on its own way and with none too high regard for each other."&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, Cited in Horowitz, Irving (1994) ''The Decomposition of Sociology'' Oxford University Press. p. 3–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Times Higher Education|The Times Higher Education Guide]]'' published a list of 'The most cited authors of books in the Humanities' (including philosophy and psychology). Seven of the top ten are listed as sociologists: [[Michel Foucault]] (1), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (2), [[Anthony Giddens]] (5), [[Erving Goffman]] (6), [[Jürgen Habermas]] (7), [[Max Weber]] (8), and [[Bruno Latour]] (10).&lt;ref name="The most cited authors of books in the humanities"/&gt;

The most highly ranked general journals which publish original research in the field of sociology are the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' and the ''[[American Sociological Review]]''.&lt;ref name=WoS/&gt; The ''[[Annual Review of Sociology]]'', which publishes original review essays, is also highly ranked.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite web |year=2011  |title=2011 Journal Citation Reports |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Social Sciences |website=Web of Science |url=&lt;!--missing--&gt; |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other generalist and specialized journals exist.

A '''spiral fracture''' (a.k.a. '''torsion fracture''') is a [[bone fracture]] occurring when [[torque]] (a rotating force) is applied along the axis of a [[bone]].&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spiral Fracture|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/NewtonianMechanics/SpiralFracture/SpiralFracture.html|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiral fractures often occur when the body is in motion while one extremity is planted. For example, a spiral fracture of the [[tibia]] (the shinbone) can occur in young children when they fall short on an extended leg while jumping. This occurrence is known as "toddler's fracture". Spiral fractures are also recognized as being suspicious in very young children since to obtain a fracture of this sort requires forceful twisting or jerking of the limbs. [[Child abuse]] (physical abuse) and certain conditions such as [[osteogenesis imperfecta]] (OI) are considered differentials when identifying spiral or torsion fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lukefahr M.D.|first1=James|title=Child Abuse and Neglect Fractures|url=http://www.utmb.edu/pedi_ed/CORE/Abuse/page_08.htm|website=www.utmb.edu|publisher=University of Texas Health Science Center|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3119">'''Spring line settlements''' occur where a ridge of [[wiktionary:permeable|permeable]] rock lies over impermeable rock and there will be a line of [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] along the boundary between the two layers.

It sometimes happens that a sequence of spring line (or springline) settlements will arise around these springs, becoming villages.

In each case to build higher up the hill would have meant difficulties with water supply; to build lower would have taken the settlement further away from useful grazing land or nearer to the [[floodplain]].

Spring line villages are often the principal settlements in [[strip parish]]es, with long, narrow [[parish]] boundaries stretching up to the top of the ridge and down to the river but being narrow in the direction of adjacent spring line villages.&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some examples in England==
* to the north and south of the [[Howardian Hills]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 40&lt;/ref&gt;
* to the west and east of the ridge that stretches south from [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and on top of which is the [[Roman road]] [[Ermine Street]]. The western line (which includes [[Boothby Graffoe]] and [[Navenby]]) is close under the escarpment; the eastern line (which includes [[Metheringham]]) is up to {{convert|6|mi|0}} away from the crest of the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 21B&lt;/ref&gt;
* to the south of [[London]] and difficult to identify among the continuous housing development of later centuries, there are: [[Ewell]] (a derivative of the [[Old English]] ''Et Welle''), [[Cheam]], [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], [[Carshalton]], [[Wallington, London|Wallington]], [[Beddington]], [[Waddon]], [[Croydon]], [[Addiscombe]], [[Elmers End]], and [[Beckenham]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 33&lt;/ref&gt; Road and place names to the north of the line provide evidence that that area was relatively uninhabited: Cheam [[common land|Common]], [[Sutton Common]], [[Thornton Heath]], and [[South Norwood|Norwood]] (a derivative of ''North Wood'').
* Below the northern [[escarpment]] of the [[South Downs]] are villages such as [[Edburton]], [[Fulking]] and [[Poynings]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 34&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Vale of the White Horse]] (now in [[Oxfordshire]], formerly in [[Berkshire]]), villages such as [[East Ginge]], West Ginge, [[Letcombe Bassett]], [[Childrey]] and [[Woolstone, Oxfordshire|Woolstone]] are at the head of wooded valleys below [[the Ridgeway]] on the north-facing scarp slope.
* In [[East Anglia]], spring line settlements such as [[Burwell, Cambridgeshire]], [[Swaffham Prior]], [[Cherry Hinton]] mark the fen edge and are close to the probable Lower [[Icknield Way]].

A [[viewshed]] is an area that is visible from a specific location. '''Viewshed analyses''' are a common function of most [[geographic information system]] (GIS) software. The analysis uses the elevation value of each cell of the [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) to determine visibility to or from a particular cell. The location of this particular cell varies depending on the needs of the analysis. 
For example, a viewshed analysis is commonly used to locate communication towers or determining the view from a road. Viewsheds can be calculated using an individual point such as a tower or multiple points such as a line representing a road. When analyzing a line segment, each of the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] along the line is calculated to determine its visible area. The process can also be reversed. For example, when locating a [[landfill]], the analysis can determine from where the landfill is visible to keep it hidden from view.

== Viewshed analysis process ==
A viewshed analysis can be performed using one of many [[GIS]] programs, such as [[GRASS GIS]] (r.los, r.viewshed), [http://www.luciad.com/solutions/luciadlightspeed LuciadLightspeed], [http://www.luciad.com/solutions/luciadmobile LuciadMobile], [[SAGA GIS]] (Visibility), TNT Mips, [[ArcMap]], [[Maptitude]], [[ERDAS IMAGINE]]. A viewshed is created from a [[digital elevation model|DEM]] by using an algorithm that estimates the difference of elevation from one cell (the viewpoint cell) to the next (the target cell). To determine the visibility of a target cell, each cell between the viewpoint cell and target cell is examined for line of sight. Where cells of higher value are between the viewpoint and target cells the line of sight is blocked. If the line of sight is blocked then the target cell is determined to not be part of the viewshed. If it is not blocked then it is included in the viewshed (Kim et al., 2004).

The algorithm is also based on a given set of variables. When performing a viewshed analysis, several variables can be used to limit or adjust the calculation. For example, if the analysis is to determine the location of a radio tower, the height of the tower could be added to the elevation of that location (cell value). If no height is given, then the viewshed analysis uses the cell value of the DEM in which the tower is located.

Another way to add the height of the tower is to use an offset variable. Offset values can be added to a sending tower as well as a receiving tower. The offset value is then added to the elevation value of the cell to obtain the actual elevation of each tower.

The viewshed analysis can also have a limited viewing angle. The viewing angle, or [[azimuth]], of the radio tower can be incorporated into the calculation by adding two values. The first value is the lowest possible azimuth angle and the second value is the highest possible azimuth angle. The program will analyze the viewshed only within these given azimuth angles. 
A vertical angle can be added as well. The values for vertical angle are from 90° (looking straight up) to -90° (looking straight down). This variable would need to be added in cases where the radio tower emits a very narrow vertical beam.
The final variable used in the viewshed analysis is the radius value. In the case of the radio tower, if the radio signal has a limited range, perhaps 10 miles, then the radius variable can be set to limit the viewshed analysis to a 10-mile radius.

== Viewshed analysis uses ==
Besides tower placement a viewshed analysis can be used for other applications. For example, a viewshed analysis could estimate the impact of the addition of a large building. The viewshed analysis would show all the areas from which the building could be seen as well as any views that would be obscured from any particular location. Viewshed analyses are also used to locate [[fire lookout tower|fire observation stations]] in mountain areas (Lee and Stucky, 1998). This allows the stations to be placed so that the entire forest can be observed for possible fires.

An example of using a viewshed analysis on a line segment is from the [[Wyoming]] State Office, [[Bureau of Land Management]], in which the office used a viewshed analysis to determine the visibility from [[National Historic Trail]]s across Wyoming. Within the Rock Springs Field Office area there are five different viewsheds to choose from. The example here is viewshed number one. The viewshed indicates the land areas visible from the trails at four different levels from not visible to visible, based on the number of times the area could be seen from the trail. This is an indication of what the pioneers could see as they traveled along the trails of the western frontier (Rock Springs Field Office).

== A unique viewshed analysis ==

In another example the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) used a viewshed analysis to assist [[NASA]]'s [[Mars Exploration Rover]] (MER) project. When NASA needed to find appropriate landing spots for the [[Mars]] rovers, they turned to the USGS to map the best possible sites. Part of the analysis included a viewshed of the possible site selections. In this case the viewshed indicates the areas which may or may not be visible by the Mars rovers from each landing site (MER Landing Site Viewshed Analysis).
