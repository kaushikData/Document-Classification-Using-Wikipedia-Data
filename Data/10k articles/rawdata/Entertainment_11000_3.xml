==Synopsis==
''7 Days in Syria'' is a harrowing look at the human side of war and what so many refugees are escaping from within Syria. The film seeks out the heroes of Aleppo, chronicling the civilians keeping the city running, providing bread, administering medical supplies, burying dead bodies, and those internally documenting the atrocities for posterity and war tribunals. It's a war film unlike any other that also sheds light on the incredible distances journalists go to shine a light on some of the darkest places in the world.

'''''Anno''''' is a [[real-time strategy]], [[city-building game|city building]] video game series, conceived in 1998 by [[Max Design]]. The series focuses on players establishing colonies on a series of small islands, conducting exploration of the region, diplomacy and trade with other civilisations and traders, while managing resources and engaging in combat both on land and sea. Most games in the series take place during Renaissance and Empire-building historical periods of Earth's history, with cultures, architecture and customs based upon real-life elements from these periods, though in-game civilisations tend to be neutral from exact nations. The more recent titles focused upon future periods of Earth's history around possible "what if" scenarios based upon current issues.

Each game in the series is mainly a stand-alone title, featuring the same level of reoccurring gameplay mechanics, though with each instalment amending existing gameplay mechanics and adding new features, with expansions packs adding in further content. Initial games mainly focused on two modes of gameplay, with players able to operate in single-player or multiplayer over LAN or online connections, while later titles added in a campaign mode of several missions, each featuring their own unique storyline - plots usually focus on players becoming involved in a major incident while beginning life as the ruler of a small island.

While primarily developed for [[Microsoft Windows|PC]], the series has also included a variety of spin-off titles mainly for handheld consoles, which in turn feature more simplified game mechanics to those of the main series. Each title over the series' history has featured a variety of different developers and publishers, with the most recent entries being currently developed by [[Blue Byte]] and published by [[Ubisoft]]. Most entries in the series have received favourable reviews from critics over gameplay mechanics.{{cn|date=December 2018}} The first title, ''[[Anno 1602]]'', was Germany's best-selling computer game of all time as of December 2002, with sales of 2.5 million copies worldwide and 1.7 million in the German market.&lt;ref name=n-tv&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130162131/https://www.n-tv.de/technik/Platin-fuer-Anno-1503-article116682.html | url=https://www.n-tv.de/technik/Platin-fuer-Anno-1503-article116682.html | title=Platin für "''Anno 1503''" | date=December 26, 2002 | author=Staff | work=[[n-tv]] | language=[[German language|German]] | archivedate=November 30, 2018 | deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Anno 1503|sequel]] broke several of its sales records, becoming Germany's fastest-selling game and fastest full-price computer game to reach 500,000 domestic sales.&lt;ref name=eurogamer&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007231711/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_47003 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_47003 |title=''Anno 1503'' fastest seller in Germany | author=Bramwell, Tom | date=November 18, 2002 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |archivedate=October 7, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sonderpreis&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130014809/http://beta.gamesmarkt.de/details/147592 | url=http://beta.gamesmarkt.de/details/147592 | title="''Anno 1503''" schlägt "''Anno 1602''" | author=Steininger, Stefan | date=January 21, 2004 | work=GamesMarkt | archivedate=November 30, 2018 | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It ultimately sold over one million units in German-speaking countries,&lt;ref name=1m&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201000249/http://beta.gamesmarkt.de/details/418357 | url=http://beta.gamesmarkt.de/details/418357 | title="''FIFA 17''" verkauft eine Millionen Units auf PS4 in Deutschland | author=Staff | date=May 15, 2017 | work=GamesMarkt | archivedate=December 1, 2018 | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, when combined with its predecesor, reached 4.5 million sales worldwide by October 2006.&lt;ref name=4m&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101213836/https://www.n-tv.de/technik/Teuerstes-Spiel-aus-Deutschland-article337536.html | url=https://www.n-tv.de/technik/Teuerstes-Spiel-aus-Deutschland-article337536.html | title=Teuerstes Spiel aus Deutschland | author=Staff | date=October 23, 2006 | archivedate=January 1, 2010 | work=[[n-tv]] | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''At Home Abroad''''' is a [[revue]] with music by [[Arthur Schwartz]] and lyrics by [[Howard Dietz]].  It introduced the songs "Love Is a Dancing Thing", "What a Wonderful World" and "Got a Bran' New Suit", among others.  The revue follows a bored couple who flee America and go on a musical world tour.

==Productions==
The original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on September 19, 1935, and ran for 198 performances. It featured in the cast [[Beatrice Lillie]], [[Ethel Waters]], Herb Williams, [[Eleanor Powell]], Paul Haakon, [[Reginald Gardiner]], [[Eddie Foy Jr.]], Vera Allen, and [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]] . 
Sketches were scripted by [[Raymond Knight (radio)|Raymond Knight]], [[Marc Connelly]] and others. The revue was produced by [[Shubert family|Messrs. Shubert]], and directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]] and [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]]; the first Broadway musical to be directed by Minnelli. 

== Synopsis ==
The setting is a cruise around the world, featuring 25 musical numbers at various locations: a London store, an African jungle ("Hottentot Potentate"), a Balkan country where Powell taps spy messages, and a West Indies dockside for "Loadin' Time", to mention a few.  The revue gave Bea Lillie the range of a variety of exotic locations. She had the tongue-twister lines "two dozen double damask dinner napkins"; became a Russian ballerina who could not "face the mujik"; and disrupted the line of geisha girls with "It's better with your shoes off" in a Japanese garden. In "Paree", she was a Parisian [[Grisette (French)|grisette]] in the Moulin Rouge in Paris, and "made something of a carnival of this song, with lyrics like 'I kiss your right bank, I kiss your left bank; kiss Montparnasse' with the emphasis on the last syllable."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Cecil Michener and Litton, Glenn.

[[File:Reel-to-ReelTapeBigHub.agr.jpg|thumb|[[Magnetic tape]] was commonly used to create master copies.]]
'''Mastering''', a form of [[audio post production]], is the process of preparing and transferring recorded audio from a source containing the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|final mix]] to a [[data storage device]] (the master), the source from which all copies will be produced (via methods such as pressing, duplication or [[Replication (optical media)|replication]]). In recent years [[digital master]]s have become usual, although analog masters, such as audio tapes, are still being used by the manufacturing industry, notably by a few engineers who have chosen to specialize in analog mastering.

Mastering requires critical listening; however, software tools exist to facilitate the process. Results still depend upon the intent of the engineer, the accuracy of the speaker monitors, and the listening environment. [[Mastering engineer]]s may also need to apply corrective equalization and dynamic compression in order to optimise sound translation on all playback systems.&lt;ref name="mixmagazine" /&gt; It is standard practice to make a copy of a master recording, known as a safety copy, in case the master is lost, damaged or stolen.

==History==

===Pre-1940s===
In the earliest days of the recording industry, all phases of the recording and mastering process were entirely achieved by mechanical processes. Performers sang and/or played into a large acoustic horn and the master recording was created by the direct transfer of acoustic energy from the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] of the recording horn to the [[mastering lathe]], typically located in an adjoining room. The cutting head, driven by the energy transferred from the horn, inscribed a modulated groove into the surface of a rotating cylinder or disc.&lt;ref name=Auld&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.recordingmag.com/resources/resourceDetail/109.html |title=Mastering Then and Now |author=Robert Auld |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These masters were usually made from either a soft metal alloy or from [[wax]]; this gave rise to the colloquial term ''waxing'', referring to the cutting of a record.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_UDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=New Technique Aids LP Waxing |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=1950-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of the [[microphone]] and [[electronic amplifier]] in the mid-1920s, the mastering process became electro-mechanical, and electrically driven mastering lathes came into use for cutting master discs (the cylinder format by then having been superseded). Until the introduction of tape recording, master recordings were almost always cut [[Direct to disc recording|direct-to-disc]].&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt; Only a small minority of recordings were mastered using previously recorded material sourced from other discs.

===Emergence of magnetic tape===
In the late 1940s, the recording industry was revolutionized by the introduction of [[magnetic tape]]. Magnetic tape was invented for recording sound by [[Fritz Pfleumer]] in 1928 in Germany, based on the invention of [[magnetic wire recording]] by [[Valdemar Poulsen]] in 1898.  Not until the end of [[World War II]] could the technology be found outside Europe. The introduction of magnetic tape recording enabled master discs to be cut separately in time and space from the actual recording process.&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt;

Although tape and other technical advances dramatically improved audio quality of commercial recordings in the post-war years, the basic constraints of the electro-mechanical mastering process remained, and the inherent physical limitations of the main commercial recording media—the 78 rpm disc and later the 7-inch 45 rpm single and 33-1/3 rpm [[Gramophone record|LP record]]—meant that the audio quality, [[dynamic range]],{{efn|Dynamic range was limited by the fact that if the mastering level was set too high, the cutting head might be damaged during the cutting process or the stylus may jump out of the groove during playback.&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt;}} and running time{{efn|Running times were constrained by the diameter of the disc and the density with which grooves could be inscribed on the surface without cutting into each other.}} of master discs were still limited compared to later media such as the [[compact disc]].

===Electro-mechanical mastering process===
From the 1950s until the advent of digital recording in the late 1970s, the mastering process typically went through several stages. Once the studio recording on multi-track tape was complete, a final [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] was prepared and dubbed down to the master tape, usually either a single-track [[Monaural|mono]] or two-track [[stereo]] tape. Prior to the cutting of the master disc, the master tape was often subjected to further electronic treatment by a specialist [[mastering engineer]]. 

After the advent of tape it was found that, especially for pop recordings, master recordings could be made so that the resulting record would sound better. This was done by making fine adjustments to the amplitude of sound at different frequency bands ([[Equalization (audio)|equalization]]) prior to the cutting of the master disc. Record mastering became a highly prized and skilled craft, and it was widely recognized that good mastering could make or break a commercial pop recording. As a result, the independent mastering studio was born. Early independent mastering engineers included [[Doug Sax]], [[Bob Ludwig]], [[Bob Katz]] and [[Bernie Grundman]] and Denny Purcell.&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt;

In large recording companies such as [[EMI]], the mastering process was usually controlled by specialist staff technicians who were conservative in their work practices. These big companies were often reluctant to make changes to their recording and production processes. For example, EMI was very slow in taking up innovations in [[multi-track recording]]{{efn|In [[multi-track recording]] each signal input is recorded to its own track on a multi-track recorder. This multi-track tape is mixed down to a mono or stereo master tape. A multi-track tape may be remixed many times, in different ways, by different engineers, giving the possibility of several masters (mono version, stereo version, LP version, AM radio version, single version, etc.).}} and they did not install 8-track recorders in their [[Abbey Road Studios]] until the late 1960s, more than a decade after the first commercial 8-track recorders were installed by American independent studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=George|authorlink1=George Martin|last2=Hornsby|first2=Jeremy|title=All you need is ears|year=1994|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-11482-6|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital technology===
[[File:Optimum-mix-levels-for-mast.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Optimum Digital Levels with respect to the Full Digital Scale (dBFSD)]]
In the 1990s, electro-mechanical processes were largely superseded by digital technology, with digital recordings stored on [[hard disk drive]]s or digital tape and mastered to [[CD]]. The [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) became common in many mastering facilities, allowing the off-line manipulation of recorded audio via a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).  Although many digital processing tools are common during mastering, it is also very common to use analog media and processing equipment for the mastering stage. Just as in other areas of audio, the benefits and drawbacks of [[Comparison of analog and digital recording|digital technology compared to analog technology]] are still a matter for debate. However, in the field of audio mastering, the debate is usually over the use of digital versus analog signal processing rather than the use of digital technology for storage of audio.&lt;ref name="mixmagazine"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://mixonline.com/recording/mastering/audio_issues_modern_mastering |work=Mix Magazine |title=Issues in Modern Mastering |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524113354/http://mixonline.com/recording/mastering/audio_issues_modern_mastering/ |archive-date=May 24, 2007 |date=May 1, 2006 |author=Blair Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital systems have higher performance and allow mixing to be performed at lower maximum levels. With peaks between -3 and -9 dBFS on a mix, the mastering engineer has enough [[Headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]] to process and produce a final master.&lt;ref name="bob_katz"&gt;[http://www.digido.com/bob-katz/mixing-tips-and-tricks.html Bob Katz Mixing Tips] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827154625/http://www.digido.com/bob-katz/mixing-tips-and-tricks.html |date=August 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to allow enough headroom for the mastering engineer's work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdmusicmastering.com/how-much-headroom-for-mastering.html How much headroom for mastering?] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20130119000648/http://cdmusicmastering.com/how-much-headroom-for-mastering.html |date=January 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduction of headroom by the mix or mastering engineer has resulted in a [[loudness war]] in commercial recordings.&lt;ref name="Shelvock" /&gt;

== Process ==
[[File:Manleyvarimu.jpg|thumb|A common mastering processor for [[dynamic range compression]]]]
The source material, ideally at the original resolution, is processed using [[equalization (audio)|equalization]], [[Dynamic range compression|compression]], [[limiting]] and other processes. Additional operations, such as editing, specifying the gaps between tracks, adjusting level, fading in and out, [[Audio noise reduction|noise reduction]] and other signal restoration and enhancement processes can also be applied as part of the mastering stage.&lt;ref name="Shelvock"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Audio Mastering as Musical Practice|last = Shelvock|first = Matt|publisher = ETDR: University of Western Ontario|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Ontario, Canada|pages = 1–72|url = http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1709&amp;context=etd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source material is put in the proper order, commonly referred to as assembly (or 'track') sequencing. These operations prepare the music for either digital or analog, e.g. vinyl, replication.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

If the material is destined for vinyl release, additional processing, such as dynamic range reduction or frequency dependent stereo–to–mono fold-down and equalization, may be applied to compensate for the limitations of that medium. Finally, for compact disc release, Start of Track, End of Track, and Indexes are defined for disc navigation. Subsequently, it is rendered either to a physical medium, such as a CD-R or DVD-R, or to computer files, such as a [[Disc Description Protocol]] (DDP) file set or an ISO file. The specific medium varies, depending on the intended release format of the final product. For [[digital audio]] releases, there is more than one possible master medium, chosen based on replication factory requirements or record label security concerns. Regardless of what delivery method is chosen, the replicator will transfer the audio to a [[Compact Disc manufacturing|glass master]] that will generate metal stampers for replication.

The process of audio mastering varies depending on the specific needs of the audio to be processed. Mastering engineers need to examine the types of input media, the expectations of the source producer or recipient, the limitations of the end medium and process the subject accordingly. General rules of thumb can rarely be applied.

Steps of the process typically include the following:
# Transferring the recorded audio tracks into the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).
# Sequence the separate songs or tracks  as they will appear on the final release.
# Adjust the length of the silence between songs.
# Process or "sweeten" audio to maximize the sound quality for the intended medium (e.g. applying specific EQ for vinyl).
# Transfer the audio to the final master format (CD-ROM, half-inch reel tape, PCM 1630 U-matic tape, etc.).

Examples of possible actions taken during mastering:&lt;ref name="Shelvock" /&gt;
# Editing minor flaws.
# Applying [[noise reduction]] to eliminate clicks, dropouts, hum and hiss.
# Adjusting stereo width.
# Adding ambience.
# Equalize audio across tracks for the purpose of optimized frequency distribution.
# Adjust volume.
# Dynamic range compression or expansion.
# [[Limiter|Peak limit]].
# [[Dither]].

&lt;!--These topics are covered more comprehensively and in more accessible terms in the second paragraph of this section. Perhaps better to incorporate any new contribution there than to dangle it here--&gt;To finish mastering a CD, track markers must be inserted, along with [[International Standard Recording Code]] (ISRC) and other information necessary to replicate a CD. Vinyl LP and cassettes have their own pre-duplication requirements for a finished master.

==Significance==
&lt;!--I'm not convinced of the significance of this bit but better to move it here for review than have it dangling at the end of the History section for no apparent reason--&gt;
Mastering has a special significance for house, techno and other styles of electronic dance music:
{{quote|...the product of mastering, regardless of the type of format, is re-actualised into a performance in the hands of the DJ. In this regard, the shift from vinyl records to digital formats in many DJ scenes and the appearance of new digital formats for DJs have encouraged new practices also among mastering engineers, whose targets are not only music listeners but, specifically, music performers as well.&lt;ref&gt;Nardi, Carlo (2014).

'''Bergamask''', '''bergomask''', '''bergamesca''',&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; or '''bergamasca''' (from the town of [[Bergamo]] in Northern [[Italy]]), is a [[dance]] and associated [[melody]] and [[chord progression]].

==Reputation==
It was considered a clumsy rustic dance (cf. [[Shakespeare]], ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Act&amp;nbsp;V Scene&amp;nbsp;i Lines&amp;nbsp;341 and 349) copied from the natives of Bergamo, reputed (according to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'') to be very awkward in their manners.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Bergamask |volume=3 |page=772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance is associated with [[clown]]s or [[buffoonery]], as is the area of Bergamo, it having lent its dialect to the Italian buffoons.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

==Chord progression==
The basic chord progression is I&amp;ndash;IV&amp;ndash;V&amp;ndash;I:&lt;ref&gt;Apel, Willi (1969). ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'', p.91. {{ISBN|978-0-674-37501-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bluebird''' ('''Sally Avril'''), sometimes rendered '''Blue Bird''', is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. She is usually depicted as a [[supporting character]] in the [[Spider-Man]] series.

==Publication history==
Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], Sally Avril first appeared in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (1962). Sally was a minor member of Flash Thompson's entourage, appearing in only one issue during the [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]]. Her "Bluebird" career was created by [[Kurt Busiek|Busiek]] (scripts) and [[Pat Olliffe|Olliffe]] (pencils) in 1996.

==Fictional character biography==
'''Sally Avril'''&lt;ref&gt;Her surname "Avril" is revealed in ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #6 (February 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; was a fellow student of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]'s at Midtown High who turned him down for a date, preferring the more handsome and muscular [[Flash Thompson]].&lt;ref name="af15"&gt;''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (August 1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty years later, writing for ''[[Untold Tales of Spider-Man]]'', [[Kurt Busiek]] resurrected the one-note brunette from obscurity and gave her a background. She was an ambitious, thrill-loving girl who took blue ribbons in [[gymnastics]]. With fellow popular kid [[Jason Ionello]], she attempted to cash in on a ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' contest offering a thousand dollars to a reader who brought in pictures of [[Spider-Man]]. Although their mission was a bust, Sally loved the thrill and became very smitten with the web-slinger when he touched her cheek just before leaving her and Jason with a warning to give it up.&lt;ref name="utsm6"&gt;''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #6 (February 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sally and Jason tailed Spidey again, who was (unwillingly) working for [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. The flash from Sally's [[camera]] roused Spidey from his hypnotic state, and a well-placed kick by the athletic young Sally took Electro by surprise long enough for Spidey to readjust his mask — which Electro had been preparing to remove — and defeat him. Spider-Man posed for a shot with an ecstatic Sally and Jason that the ''Bugle'' ran.&lt;ref name="utsm7"&gt;''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #7 (March 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Suffused with glee, Sally tried to get a permanent gig on the ''Bugle'', but was told the photographer's job was filled — by Peter Parker.&lt;ref name="utsm10"&gt;''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #10 (June 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Peter admitted this but asked her not to tell their fellow Midtowners. Sally donned an eccentric blue-and-white costume and decided, with her aerobic skills, to become a superheroine. She asked Peter to take some ''Bugle'' pics of her doing some stunts, but Peter refused. Angered, she threatened to blackmail him by revealing that he took Spider-Man pictures, but he undercut her by telling them himself.&lt;ref name="utsm11"&gt;''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #11 (July 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bluebird's zeal but lack of experience caused trouble for Spider-Man during fights with [[Scarlet Beetle]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. Her "ether egg" weapons would detonate prematurely or have little effect, once even allowing the [[villain]] to escape.&lt;ref name="utsm11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="utsm12"&gt;''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #12 (August 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Considering her more trouble than she was worth, Spider-Man allowed the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]]'s men to hurt her quite badly in order to dissuade her from interfering in his fights again, although he later felt remorseful.

Bruised but undaunted, Sally and Jason headed to an area where Spider-Man was fighting the Black Knight, with Sally's camera. She intended to capture some shots of the fight. However, Sally's zeal ended up costing her her life when she begged Jason to speed in his car, and the two ran a red light. Their car struck an oncoming bus, with Jason incurring mild head trauma, and Sally being killed.&lt;ref name="utsm13"&gt;''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' #13 (September 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Spider-Man felt horrible about this. ''"She'll never laugh again... She'll never toss her head the way she did, instantly dismissing whatever she didn't want to think about in favor of something new. She'll never smile, never capture everyone's attention with a few words, never light up a room with her determination and humor. She could be obnoxious, even pushy, but she was vital and alive and fun to be around and now she's gone."''&lt;ref name="utsm13"/&gt;

During the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Sally Avril is cloned by [[Ben Reilly]] posing as [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] and is seen in New U Technologies' facility area called Haven.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Bluebird possessed no superhuman powers and used the following gadgets to fight crime: a retractable rope-line, insulated boots to protect her from electricity, blue paint pellets and ether-filled "eggs". Avril was also a skilled gymnast.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Sally Avril appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. This series depicts her as [[Randy Robertson]]'s shrill-voiced girlfriend. She also is blonde, although her natural hair color in the comics was black (she donned a long blonde wig as Bluebird). She generally has the original appearance of [[Liz Allan]], who is Hispanic in this series. She loudly turns Peter down for a date in the pilot episode and then becomes angry that Randy doesn't seem jealous about him approaching her. Sally is shown to have some typical high school mean girl traits when she is utterly surprised as to why a gorgeous girl like [[Mary Jane Watson]] would come to a prom with the nerdy Peter Parker. Later, she tries to put Mary Jane down by sneering at how she was dumped by the "King of Geeks" Parker and she is seen yelling at her fellow clique-member [[Glory Grant]] over displeasing the latter's prom date [[Harry Osborn]] before he could offer their group a ride home in his personal limousine. She vociferously blames Peter for [[Liz Allan]] and Flash's breakup. She also mocks [[Flash Thompson]]'s hero-worship of Spidey when he is framed for [[armed robbery]] by [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and his associates [[Mysterio|Quentin Beck]] and [[Tinkerer|Phineas Mason]]. Later Flash tells Peter, after [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s heart attack, that "even Sally feels sorry for you", suggesting that perhaps she is beginning to soften towards him. In "Probable Cause", she is paired up with Peter in a Police Ride-A-Long where they were driven around by Captain [[George Stacy]]. She continues to insult him, but when the car is attacked by the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]], causing it to crash and apparently kill Peter (he has actually changed into his Spider-Man suit), Sally is genuinely shocked and saddened. When he turns up alive and well later, she even hugs him with relief, though she is still upset about the ruined trip and warns Peter to tell no one about the hug.

'''''Bonecruncher''''' is a [[computer game]] for the [[Acorn Electron]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amiga]] first published by [[Superior Software]] in 1987. It is a [[puzzle video game|puzzle game]] which uses the 'rocks and diamonds' mechanics of ''[[Boulder Dash]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[image:Bonecruncher in-game screen (BBC).png|thumb|left|BBC Micro screenshot showing Fozzy (red), Bono (green), a skeleton and a Glook (white)]]
The player controls a dragon called Bono, who operates a soap business. He collects bones from around the chambers of his castle and uses them to make soap in a [[cauldron]]. He then delivers the soap to sea-monsters, situated at various exits from the castle.

The game uses the 'rocks and diamonds' mechanics as popularised in the game ''Boulder Dash'', and Superior's own ''[[Repton (computer game)|Repton]]'' series, whereby the player can dig through earth and push boulders but where boulders will fall from above if area below them is cleared. The main difference in this game is that, although the characters are depicted in side profile, the camera is meant to be overhead so objects are not subject to gravity in the same way. The 'boulders' are living creatures known as Glooks and rather than just heading down the screen, they will head in the direction of a bathing sea-monster. As such, they change direction during play which changes the layout of the maze. This means the player must decide the order that the soap is delivered. Glooks are generally harmless but can crush the player when they move.

There are two other deadly creatures in the castle: monsters and spiders. Monsters can be trapped by pushing Glooks onto them. If they can't move, they turn to skeletons which Bono can collect to make soap. They can also be lured into trapdoors but then their bones are lost. Spiders, as well as being deadly to Bono, eat skeletons.

Another character in the game is Bono's assistant Fozzy who can be used to hold back monsters or spiders but can become trapped. There are also keys and doors and on each level a hidden 'volcano' that will spew out Glooks if walked over.

It takes five skeletons to make a bar of soap and five bars of soap must be created, and delivered to the sea-monsters, in each chamber. There are 22 chambers in the castle.&lt;ref&gt;Original instructions, Superior Software&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and release==
The game was designed by German programmer Andreas Kemnitz, originally for the Commodore 64. He submitted the game to Superior Software, who had recently published the similar ''[[Repton 3]]'' on the C64. Superior commissioned conversions to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron, machines on which they were market leaders, and also Amiga. All versions of the game are almost identical, with no real changes for the [[16-bit]] Amiga version. The game was launched before Christmas 1987 with all four versions being advertised but the Amiga version was delayed,&lt;ref name="games machine"/&gt; finally getting released in Spring 1988.

The BBC and Electron versions were included on the ''Play It Again Sam 7'' compilation in 1989 and reissued as part of the Superior/[[Blue Ribbon (software house)|Blue Ribbon]] budget series in 1990.

==Critical reception==
The game received mostly positive reviews but there was a mixed response. [[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]] gave the C64 version a score of 943 (out of 1000)&lt;ref name="ACE C64"&gt;[http://amr.abime.net/review_42622 ''Bonecruncher'' review], Advanced Computer Entertainment, Issue 6, March 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and the Amiga version 948.&lt;ref name="ACE Amiga"&gt;[http://amr.abime.net/review_42527 ''Bonecruncher'' review], Advanced Computer Entertainment, Issue 8, May 1988&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electron User]] gave an overall score of 9/10, particularly praising the humour of the game and the "beautifully animated" [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]].&lt;ref name="electron user"&gt;[http://8bs.com/elecgame/bonecruncher.htm "Good Clean Fun"], Electron User #5.04, January 1988&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Games Machine]] also picked out the character animation for praise in their review of the BBC Micro and C64 versions and while generally positive, awarding a score of 70%, the review questions the relevance of this type of game; "''Bone Cruncher'' is an old-style game and its general aim is a little tired by today's standards. However, it is cleverly designed, presents sufficient challenge for worthy gameplay and the creatures' representation adds considerable charm".&lt;ref name="games machine"&gt;[http://amr.abime.net/review_42884 "It Just Won't Wash"], The Games Machine, Issue 3, February 1988&lt;/ref&gt; When reviewing the Amiga version, they gave a lower score of 61% as while conceding it "plays just as well as the 8-bit game", the fact that "it lacks any attempt at improvement" on a much more capable machine was considered a mistake.&lt;ref name="games machine 2"&gt;[http://amr.abime.net/review_43152 "Soap operandum"], The Games Machine, Issue 6, May 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zzap!64]] were less impressed, giving a score of 56% and concluding that the game is a "polished, but merely average addition to an already jaded format".&lt;ref name="zzap"&gt;[http://www.zzap64.co.uk/cgi-bin/displaypage.pl?issue=034&amp;amp;page=025&amp;amp;thumbstart=0&amp;amp;magazine=zzap&amp;amp;check=1 ''Bone Cruncher'' review], Zzap!64, Issue 34, February 1988&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer and Video Games|C+VG]], reviewing the C64 version, went further, saying the game is "antiquated" and "a load of dross", awarding only 5/10 for playability and 4/10 for sound, graphics and value.&lt;ref name="cvg"&gt;[http://amr.abime.net/review_34380 ''Bone Cruncher'' review], Computer and Video Games, Issue 76, February 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brat''''' is a 1991 action puzzle [[video game]] developed by [[Foursfield]] and published by [[Image Works]] for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]].

==Gameplay==
''Brat'' is an [[Isometric projection|isometric]] action puzzle in which the player guides Nathan, the [[Spoiled child|brat]] of the title, through a series of twelve levels. The isometric landscape scrolls up-screen, imposing a time limit on each level. Whilst Nathan automatically walks forwards at the same rate, if he is diverted he will begin to lag behind. If the screen catches up with him, the player loses one of three lives and must restart the level. Nathan is not controlled directly: the player must place icons onto the level to guide his movement. There are a variety of items that can be collected by Nathan, then later placed by the player to bypass certain obstacles: deadly spring toys can be suppressed with a lead weight, and building blocks can bridge gaps, for example.

[[Image:RX-563AL.jpg |thumb|220px|Rack-mounted video monitors as used in television broadcasting.]]

A '''video monitor''' also called a '''broadcast monitor''', '''broadcast video monitor''', '''broadcast reference monitor''' or just '''reference monitor''', is a [[display device]] similar to a [[television set]], used to monitor the output of a video-generating device, such as [[playout]] from a [[video server]], [[Integrated receiver/decoder|IRD]], [[video camera]], [[VCR]], or [[DVD player]].  It may or may not have [[professional audio]] monitoring capability. Unlike a [[television set]], a video monitor has no [[tuner (television)]] and, as such, is unable independently to tune into an [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] broadcast like a [[television receiver]]. One common use of video monitors is in [[television station]]s, [[television studio]]s, [[production truck]]s and in [[outside broadcast]] vehicles, where [[broadcast engineer]]s use them for confidence checking of [[analog signal]] and [[Digital signal (broadcasting)|digital signal]]s throughout the system.

[[Video monitor]]s are used extensively in the security industry with [[closed-circuit television camera]]s (CCTV) and recording devices.

'''Common display types for video monitors'''
* [[Cathode ray tube]]
* [[Liquid crystal display]]
* [[Plasma display]]

'''Common monitoring formats for security'''
* [[Composite video]]
* [[S-Video]]

==Broadcast reference monitor==

Broadcast reference monitors must be used for video [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] at television or [[television studio]] facilities, because they do not perform any video enhancements and try to produce as accurate an image as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/tech3320 EBU - User requirements for Video Monitors in Television Production]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadcastengineering.com/test_measurement/broadcast_monitors_video_801/ Broadcast Engineering - Broadcast monitors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519044441/http://broadcastengineering.com/test_measurement/broadcast_monitors_video_801/ |date=2008-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4117457 IEEE Xplore 2.0 - Psycho-physical method of television picture quality evaluation (EBU-II)]&lt;/ref&gt; For quality control purposes, it is necessary for a broadcast reference monitor to produce (reasonably) consistent images from facility to facility, to reveal any flaws in the material, and also not to introduce any image artifacts (such as [[aliasing]]) that is not in the source material. Broadcast monitors will try to avoid [[Video post-processing|post processing]] such as a [[video scaler]], [[line doubling]] and any image enhancements such as [[dynamic contrast]].  However, display technologies with fixed pixel structures (e.g. LCD, plasma) must perform [[image scaling]] when displaying SD signals as the signal contains non-square pixels while the display has square pixels.&lt;ref name="scaling-artifacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadcast-monitors.glennchan.info/scaling-artifacts/scaling-artifacts.htm|title=Scaling artifacts and resolution|last=Chan|first=Glenn|date=2008|work=Broadcast Reference Monitors|accessdate=2008-10-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LCDs and plasmas are also inherently progressive displays and may need to perform [[deinterlacing]] on [[interlaced video]] signals.

Some professional video broadcast monitors display information on screen, the current video signal format, they might be receiving i.e.: [[standard definition]] formats like [[576i]], [[480i]] or [[high-definition video|high definition]] formats like [[720p]] or [[1080p]]. They also have [[Push-button|mechanical buttons]] to toggle common aspect ratios like ([[4:3]] or [[16:9]]), and [[underscan]]ning or [[overscan]]ning a picture to see lines in the [[vertical blanking interval]] (VBI) of video, and  check if [[subtitles]] in VBI were inserted properly or not. Modern broadcast grade professional monitors also have [[safe area (television)|safe area]] grid generators, to help position [[television]] [[graphic]]s, [[lower thirds]], within their respective areas i.e. graphics safe, [[title safe]] or [[action safe]].

'''Common monitoring formats for broadcasters'''
* [[Component video]]
* [[Composite video]]
* [[Serial Digital Interface]] (SDI, as SD-SDI or HD-SDI)

===Features===

Professional video monitors have various features that consumer monitors lack such as:

* Conforms to [[colorimetry]] standards such as the [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] C, [[Rec. 709]], or EBU primaries.
* [[Serial Digital Interface|SDI]] inputs / outputs.
* [[AES/EBU]] Audio decoding.
* [[Genlock]] input.
* [[General Purpose Input/Output|GPI]] interface – for receiving external triggers.
* Modular expansion card slots that support [[SMPTE 259M|SD-SDI]] or [[SMPTE 292M|HD-SDI]] single link or [[SMPTE 372M|dual-link HD-SDI]] cards.
* [[Safe area (television)|Safe area]] cage. 
* [[19-inch rack|Rack]] mountable.

'''''Bun Fun''''' is a computer game written by A.J. Turner for the [[BBC Micro]] home computer and published by Squirrel Software on cassette in {{vgy|1983}}. It was later ported to the [[Acorn Electron]].

==Gameplay==
In the game, the player manages a production line. A number of buns sit on a conveyor belt and, by rhythmic tapping of two keys on the computer, the player decorates them with icing, sugar and walnuts to produce a 'gudbun'. The more gudbuns the player produces, the more wages that player earns.

'''Cal Stewart''' (b. 1856 Charlotte County, [[Virginia]], d. December 7, 1919) was a pioneer in [[vaudeville]] and early [[sound recordings]].  He is best remembered for his comic monologues in which he played "Uncle Josh" Weathersby, a resident of a mythical [[New England]] farming town called "[[Pumpkin|Punkin]] Center."

Born in [[Charlotte County, Virginia]] in 1856, Stewart spent his early life working in circuses, medicine shows and vaudeville to great acclaim as "Uncle Josh Weathersby from Way Down East".  It was on the road that he befriended [[Mark Twain]] and later [[Will Rogers]], two men who shared similar wit in comedy.

Around 1897, [[Edison Records|Thomas Edison's studios]] hired him to cut several cylinder recordings of his famous speeches and songs.  They were well received by the public, and launched an entire series of recordings based on the Uncle Josh character.  Stewart's trademark on these recordings is the easily recognizable laugh that precedes his speeches.

Best-selling recordings included “Uncle Josh’s Arrival in New York” (1898), “I’m Old But I’m Awfully Tough (Laughing Song)” (1898), “Jim Lawson’s Horse Trade With Deacon Witherspoon” (1901), “Uncle Josh’s Huskin’ Bee Dance” (1901) and “Uncle Josh Buys an Automobile” (1903). He wrote the song "[[Ticklish Reuben]]" in 1900.

Stewart continued recording on Edison, [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]], and independent labels up until his death on December 7, 1919.  He also wrote two books based on his monologues and performed in theaters across America with his wife and her brother and sister.

Stewart is represented on the 2007 compilation ''[[Actionable Offenses: Indecent Phonograph Recordings from the 1890s]]''.

'''Calinda''' (also spelled '''kalinda''' or '''kalenda''') is a martial art, as well as kind of folk music and [[dance]] in the Caribbean which arose in the 1720s. 

Calinda is the French spelling, and the Spanish equivalent is ''calenda''.

==History==
Calinda is a kind of stick-fighting commonly seen practiced during [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago Carnival]].&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard and Julia Girouard, "'Colinda':  Mysterious Origins of a Cajun Folksong," ''[[Journal of Folklore Research]]'' 29 (January–April 1992: 37-52.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the national [[martial art]] of [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]]. French planters with their slaves, free coloreds and mulattos from neighboring islands of [[Grenada]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and [[Dominica]] migrated to Trinidad during the [[Cedula of Population]]. Carnival had arrived with the French; slaves who could not participate formed a parallel celebration called [[canboulay]], the precursor for Trinidad's Carnival. After Emancipation of slavery, a lead vocalist or [[chantwell]] (''chantuelle'') would sing [[call-and-response]] chants called ''lavways'' lionizing and cheering on champion stickfighters. There, Carnival songs are considered to be derived from calinda chants and "lavways". This form of music gradually evolved into the modern [[Calypso music|calypso]].

Before the Emancipation from slavery and its integration into Carnival, Calinda was used as a type of performance to provide ways of entertainment for slaves. Once the French came to Trinidad, stick fighters were no longer known as stick men but as boismen (bois meaning stick in French). There were different factors involved in stick fighting, including a costume that the performers would have to wear and the gayelles (or arenas) they would fight in. There are also special rituals that are done in the gayelle before the fight starts that include different ceremonial songs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mypanyard.co.uk/History-stick-fighting-bois.html|title=Stick Fighting - Steelpan teaching resources @mypanyard ...  UK loves pan|last=KCG|website=www.mypanyard.co.uk|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;                                                                         

Though it is more commonly practiced as a dance because of the violent outcome of stick-fighting, its roots are still that of a martial art originating from [[Kingdom of Kongo]], and stick-fights still occur in Trinidad. They also have been formalised into annual Carnival competitions.&lt;ref&gt;''Trinidad Sweet - The People, Their Culture, Their Island'' - Bird, Adrian Curtis (1992) Inprint Publications LTD, Port of Spain, Trinidad, W.I.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elsewhere in the Caribbean==
It s also practiced in other parts of the Caribbean, such as [[Martinique]].&lt;ref&gt;"Tangled Roots: Kalenda and Other Neo-African Dances in the Circum-Caribbean" by Julian Gerstin, ''New West Indies Guide'' 78 (1&amp;2): 5-41 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Guadeloupe]] (under various names such as ''l'agya'', ''damaye'' and ''mayolé'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lameca.org/dossiers/kalinda_trinidad/p6.htm Lameca : kalinda]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalenda is one name assigned to an Afro-Caribbean form of stick fighting as practiced in [[Haiti]] and entering the United States through the port city of [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kalenda'' by Dennis Newsome at http://malandros-touro.com/kalenda.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=June 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite_web or similar to provide source details.}} 

Similar forms of this martial art exist elsewhere in the Caribbean. For example, in Barbados it is commonly referred to as "[[Bajan stick-licking|stick-licking]]" or "stick science."

==In Louisiana==

The well-known [[Cajun]] song "Allons danser Colinda" is about a Cajun boy asking a girl named Colinda to do a risqué dance with him; probably derived from the Calinda dance which was reported to have been performed in [[New Orleans]] by Afro-Caribbean slaves brought to [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Shane K. Bernard and Julia Girouard, "'Colinda':  Mysterious Origins of a Cajun Folksong," ''[[Journal of Folklore Research]]'' 29 (January–April 1992: 37-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dancing the "Calinda" is also referred to in one of Louisiana writer Kate Chopin's most famous stories from ''Bayou Folk'' (1894), "La Belle Zoraïde," which stresses the strong Afro-Caribbean presence in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/chopinbayou/bayou.html#bayouf280&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4377">The '''Canada Cup''' is an annual [[fighting game]] event held in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. Launched as the '''Calgary Cup''' in 2009, the event, organized by Lap Chi Duong, has been a major ''[[Street Fighter]]'' tournament and is part of the [[Capcom Pro Tour]].

==Description==
Property manager and [[granite]] shop owner Lap Chi Duong organizes the Canada Cup fighting game event once a year.&lt;ref name=Motherboard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/canada-cup-toronto-street-fighter-v-super-smash-bros-melee|work=[[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]]|title=How Some Guys From Calgary Started Canada's Biggest Fighting eSports Tournament|last=Marc|first=Shaw|date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Street Fighter]]'' tournament held at the Canada Cup has been a Premier Event of the [[Capcom Pro Tour]] since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://capcomprotour.com/announcing-capcom-pro-tour-2015/|publisher=[[Capcom Pro Tour]]|title=Announcing Capcom Pro Tour 2015|date=2015-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; David "Atari" Bibona noted in 2014 that the Canada Cup is the biggest gathering of high-level ''[[Super Street Fighter II Turbo]]'' players, in part due to its international focus, allowing American players to compete with Japanese competitors, where ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo'' has a more active scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/esports/stories/1331826968276/super-turbo-s-legacy-continues-at-canada-cup|work=[[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]]|title=Super Turbo's Legacy Continues at Canada Cup|last=Shaw|first=Marc|date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]]'' described the Canada Cup in 2016 as the "largest and most prestigious fighting game tournament in the country."&lt;ref name=Motherboard /&gt;

==History==
The Canada Cup started in 2009 as the Calgary Cup, held in [[Calgary]] rather than Toronto. The tournament was rebranded as the Canada Cup the following year as top ''Street Fighter'' players like [[Daigo Umehara]] and [[Justin Wong]] flew in to compete in the competition. In 2011, Duong decided to charge [[Twitch.tv]] viewers of the tournaments $8.95 [[USD]] for commercial-free, high-definition [[livestreaming|livestreams]], which became a running gag among the [[fighting game community]]. Duong moved the tournament to Toronto in 2012, though he had difficulty convincing sponsors and finding support. Duong stated in an interview with ''Motherboard'' that he had contacted 200 unique sponsors at the time, and only one responded positively: [[Mad Catz]]. The Cup moved back to Calgary for one year in 2014, which Duong noted as the first year it did not operate at a loss.&lt;ref name=Motherboard /&gt;

===2015===
In 2015, the Canada Cup became the final Premier Event of the Capcom Pro Tour season. The winner of its ''[[Super Street Fighter IV]]'' tournament automatically qualified for the [[2015 Capcom Cup]]. 13 of the top 23 players in the Capcom Pro Tour rankings competed in the competition, and ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' described the Canada Cup as the "deepest tournaments of the season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/canada-cup-capcom-pro-tour-preview/|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|title=The contenders and hopefuls at this weekend's Canada Cup|last=Jurek|first=Steven|date=2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournament was eventually won by [[Tokido]], defeating [[Fuudo]] in the finale by playing [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma]] with a solid ground game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/esports/stories/1331757211139/tokido-wins-canada-cup-a-cpt-ranking-spot-opens|work=[[Red Bull GmbH|Red Bull]]|title=Tokido Earns a Hard-Fought Win at Canada Cup|last=Martin|first=Michael|date=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
{{main|Canada Cup 2016}}
Canada Cup 2016 hosted 14 tournaments. Duong invited high-level ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' players [[Armada (video gamer)|Armada]], [[Hungrybox]], and [[Mang0]] through a [[publicity stunt]], donating a large amount of money to their Twitch.tv streams in order to contact them. The Canada Cup was again the final ''Street Fighter'' tournament of the Capcom Pro Tour, and became the first Premier Event in two years to have an American champion: [[NuckleDu|Du "NuckleDu" Dang]].

'''Charlotta Maria Eriksson''' (11 February 1794 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1862) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] stage actress.  She was also an instructor and deputy principal of the ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]''.  She belonged to the elite actors of the [[Royal Dramatic Theater]].&lt;ref name="Nordensvan, Georg (1917)"&gt;Nordensvan, Georg, Svensk teater och svenska skådespelare från Gustav III till våra dagar. Förra delen, 1772-1842, Bonnier, Stockholm, 1917 ['Swedish theatre and Swedish actors from Gustav III to our days. First Book 1772–1842'] {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Charlotta Eriksson was the natural daughter of Christina Halling.  Her original surname was Lambert, and is traditionally claimed to be the daughter of an innkeeper with the surname Lambert, but her father is likely to have been P. J. Lambert, concert master of the theater, to whom her mother worked as a maid by the time of her birth.&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow"&gt;Maria Charlotta Erikson, urn:sbl:15420, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Stig Torsslow.), hämtad 2018-06-14.{{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1797 her mother married Emanuel Ericsson, a servant of the royal household and later a pad maker, and Charlotta took the name of her stepfather.&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;

She was enrolled as a student in the acting school ''[[Dramatens elevskola]]'' in 1805.

=== Career at the Royal Dramatic Theater ===

Charlotta Eriksson was engaged as a premier actress at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] 1 April 1812.  The same year, she married Johan Fredrik Wikström (1779-1865), master of the choir of the Royal Swedish Opera, and was known as Charlotta Wikström until her divorce in 1821 when she, in accordance with the custom of divorced women at the time, took the name and title of Mrs Eriksson.  The cause of her divorce was her wish to marry her lover, the actor [[Jean Baptiste Édouard Du Puy|Edvard du Puy]], whose death in 1822 caused her to temporary retire from the stage in the spring and summer that year.&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;

Charlotta Eriksson was foremost a dramatic actress.  However, as was the custom at the time of the royal theatres (the Royal Swedish Opera and the Royal Dramatic Theater), an actor could participate in lyric performances if they were able, and Eriksson is known to have participated in some opera performances, notably as a [[Papagena]] in ''Trollflöjten'' by [[Mozart]] (30 maj 1812).&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;

One of her first successes was in 1820, when she played [[Ophelia]] instead of [[Carolina Kuhlman]] and praised for her realistic interpretation of insanity.  In May 1821, Charlotta Eriksson had one of her greatest successes when she played the title role in the Swedish premier of [[Maria Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]] by [[Schiller]], and are referred to as one of the greatest stars of the Royal Dramatic Theater of her generation alongside [[Nils Almlöf]], [[Ulrik Torsslow]] and [[Sara Torsslow]].&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;     Among her more noted roles were Beata Trolle in P. A. Granbergs ''Svante Sture och Märta Lejonhufvud'' (1812), Sally in ''Hartford och Sally'' by Zschokke (1814), Sofia in A. F. Skjöldebrands ''Herman von Unna'' (1817) and one of the [[norns]] in ''Balder'' by J. D. Valerius (1819), the title role of ''Preciosa'' by Weber-Wolffs (1824) and Ophelia in ''Hamlet'' (1824), Luise in Schillers ''Kabal och kärlek'' (1833), title role of ''Thérése eller den fader- och moderlösa flickan från Geneve'' by V. Ducange (1820), Berta örindur in [[Adolf Müllner]]s ''Skulden'' (1830).  
A role often mentioned in connection to her, and which made a great impression in the audience, was her role in ''Sömngångaren'' ('Sleepwalker') by Piccini, in which she walked, talked and finally danced without showing any feelings whatsoever, in an interpretation of a [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalker]].

Charlotta Eriksson was foremost appreciated within the genre of French salon comedies, a very popular genre at the time in which she was often given the main women roles and performed them with success, becoming a star of the genre.&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;    
A typical role of that kind was her role of Amelie in''Trettio år af en spelares lefnad'' ('Thirty years of a gamlers life') by [[Ducange]] and [[Dinaux]] (1833), in which she was reviewed in ''[[Aftonbladet]]'': »Mrs E. developed more warmth, intensity and nuance as Amelie than normally found in her in roles of pathetic nature, and was as interesting in every aspect of it without being alike in one."&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;

As an actor, Eriksson was described as a follower of the by then newly introduced realistic way of acting: because she lacked the ability to perform with the old fashioned melodramatic way in which such roles were still depicted, she was not considered to be of use within tragedy, but her natural way of acting was seen as perfect for the modern acting method, which was then very much appreciated within comic drama.   She made several trips to study drama in France and Italy, where she reportedly regarded [[Mademoiselle Mars]] as a role model, and she is alongside Sara Torsslow, [[Ulrik Torsslow]] and [[Nils Almlöf]] credited with being one of the role models of the realistic acting method which replaced the old 18th-century stylistic acting method in 19th-century Sweden.&lt;ref name="Nordensvan, Georg (1917)" /&gt;

[[File:178-Charlotte Erikson som Preciosa.jpg|thumb|left|Charlotta Erikson as [[Preciosa (play)|Preciosa]].]]

Described as "a clear and above all vivid intellect, an uncommon general knowledge and a by then unusually natural way of acting, which in combination with an appearance very much to her advantage and high quality sense of costume made her much appreciated by the audience as a cultivated lady within salon comedy."&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;  
She was generally given good reviews by critics, which were fairly consistent with each other her entire career.&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;    A typical review was that given in ''[[Dagligt Allehanda]]'' of her performance in the title role of ''Louise de Lignerolles'' by av Dinaux and Légouvé (1839), she was seen as typifying the modern style and as a role model for it: 
"As for the acting, we do full justice to the admirable way in which Mrs E performed the title role. In it she displayed all the qualities which typifies the French or more correctly the [[Mademoiselle Mars|Marsian school]] which even in the most intense moments never neglect confidence and elegance in posture, and an acting, studied and skillfully performed in the finest nuances but still so natural that hardly even a trace was visible of any conscious effort. In these parts of the art Mrs E deserve to be hold out as a role model."&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;  
Private critics review her in a similar way. [[Marianne Ehrenström]] described Charlotta Eriksson as a woman with natural grace who was much loved as an actress, and M. J. Crusenstolpe said of her: "Mrs E. can be photographically painted with one word: elegance. It passed through her entire being, expressed itself in her every gesture, was evident in her dress, always new but never overloaded with ostentation and gewgaw."&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;

In contemporary press, the star actresses [[Sara Torsslow]], Charlotta Eriksson and [[Elise Frösslind]] were compared to a [[rose]] or a [[tulip]], a [[jasmine]] or a [[Bellis perennis|daisy]], and a [[lily]] or a [[forget-me-not]], by which Torsslow was claimed to represent "The Deeply Moving", Eriksson "The Sensitive Grace and Feminine Gracefulness" and Frösslind "The Timid Sweetness, Wit and Naivety".&lt;ref name="Nordensvan, Georg (1917)" /&gt;  
Her position was illustrated by her income: in 1834, she was given a salary of 1.600 in comparison to the average actress salary of 200, a salary equal to the prima donna of the Royal Opera [[Henriette Widerberg]], and not much lower than the highest paid male colleague, which was 1.800.&lt;ref name="Nordensvan, Georg (1917)" /&gt;

===Later career===

Charlotta Eriksson participated in the great strike known as the First Torsslow Argument, and signed an article of protest along with several other of the most influential actors 4 July 1828 against initiated financial reforms which caused great attention in the press,&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;   but returned to her position when the demands of the strike was met and the reforms stopped.  When the same reforms was introduced in 1834, she joined the second strike known as the Second Torsslow Argument, but this time the strike failed and several of the participants were fired.   Charlotta Eriksson lost her position at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, officially because the theater management claimed they could no longer afford her.&lt;ref name="Nordensvan, Georg (1917)" /&gt;    She was for a time active at the ''[[Djurgårdsteatern]]''.  She was however missed by the audience at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, the decision to fire her was considered to be hasty and there were demands that she should be engaged there again.   The theater monopoly of the royal theaters inside the city borders of the capital made it difficult to secure employment, and in 1836, she asked to be taken back by the management of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, which immediately accepted, but lowered her salary from 1600 to 825.&lt;ref name="Nordensvan, Georg (1917)" /&gt;     Her acceptance of a re engagement at the Royal Dramatic Theatre was reportedly med with "a common satisfaction".&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;

Upon her return, Eriksson was initially forced to replace [[Sara Torsslow]] in the women main roles of tragedies, which exposed her to bad reviews for a while as the genre was not considered suited for her, until these roles were taken over by [[Emilie Högqvist]], who became the new star within Torsslow's former repertoire.  Eriksson could now return to her own repertoire, and the remainder of her career was successful.

During this period, she was gradually replaced by [[Emilie Högqvist]] in the heroine roles of the French salon comedies.  When Högqvist was given the role of Victorine by Dumersan, Gabriel and Dupeuty (1836), a review in ''Teater och Musik'' wrote: 
:»Mrs E. and [[Mamsell]] Högqvist were both considered for the part of Victorine, which was finally given to Mamsell Högqvist, and we believe that this choice :was a better one in some aspects. Mrs E:s talents are, as commonly known, most splendid in the higher comedy, notwithstanding her success in dramas such as :''Trettio år af en spelares lefnad''. Mamsell Högqvist do not possess the polite tone, that feeling of ''[[comme il faut]]'' which belongs to Mrs E in so high :regard, but she does have more of a vivid, quixotic feeling, and in the more sentimental roles she are often capable to move the audience to tears."&lt;ref name="Stig Torsslow" /&gt;   
However, she belonged to the theaters' elite actors until her retirement and her late successes was Catherine II in Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffers' ''Favorite'' (1841) and Duchess of Marlborough in Scribes ''A Glass of Water'' (1841).  In 1838, the paper ''Freja'' praised her as "far superior to all the other actresses" of the Royal Dramatic Theatre.&lt;ref name="Nordensvan, Georg (1917)" /&gt;

Aside from her activity as an actress, Charlotta Eriksson was also active as a translator, and translated several plays from the French language to Swedish, which was then staged at the Royal Dramatic Theatre.  She was also active as a deputy principal and an instructor of declamation at the ''Dramatens elevskola'' in 1837-1841.

Charlotta Eriksson retired from the Royal Dramatic Theatre after the 1841-42 season with a full pension.

===Later life===

Also after he retirement, Charlotta Eriksson was active onstage because of her interest of acting, though she no longer had financial reasons to work.  She occasionally made sporadic guest performances in smaller theaters as well as at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, such as the travelling theaters of A. G. Wallins and W. T. Gilles, and at the ''[[Mindre teatern]]'' in the season of 1847-48, where she "continued to be what she has always been – an example for every younger actress."&lt;ref name="Nordensvan, Georg (1917)" /&gt;   She made another season at the Mindre Teatern in 1849-50 and finally made her last performance at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in 1855, when she reportedly retained all the popularity of her audience.

Aside from her stage activity she traveled during her retirement, and witnessed the siege of [[Milan]] during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states]].
She spent several years in [[Italy]], and finally settled in [[Düsseldorf]] in [[Germany]], where her son studied art. She studied art with him and died there in 1862.

In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] it is called '''''Cifra''''' to a [[genre]] of traditional melody with accompaniment, associated with usually improvised texts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elnacionalista.mforos.com/874874/11186560-musica-y-danzas-folkloricas-de-argentina-la-cifra/|title=Foro de El Nacionalista - Música y danzas folklóricas de Argentina: LA CIFRA - Musica|last=|first=|date=2017-12-17|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In this genre the text are improvise by two competing performers; to the songs that alternate two participants or more, on the basis of impromptu or made-up songs; to the songs of the performer alone who improvises on a topic requested by his audience. But the cifra is mainly the song of the "payadores" (singers from Argentinian [[Pampas|Pampa]]) who improvise in opposition. The way in which this interrupted song is combined and linked to the strumming of the guitar is the most characteristic of it and, unique singularity in American songbooks. In fact, the song dialogues with the guitar. A series of strummed chords serves as a prelude. When the singer raises his voice, the guitar goes silent. Once one or two verses are finished, the strumming or some grave note punctuated by a brief interlude breaks again, and thus, the verse runs to the end. No having measure for interludes or account for repetitions of verses, the form is more or less free. In the best times of the genre, it was used as a confrontation between two singers to change sharp questions or answers in strophe. While strumming the initial prelude, the payador thinks about his first question and, launched to sing the verses, interrupts and interludes as much as he needs to continue thinking about the idea or the versification; keep it up until it complete the thought and stanza. At that moment his opponent choose the verse of the question and initiates his response in the same way. An improviser is all the more skilled the less the number of repetitions and interludes required to be versed.

[[Samoa]]'s first ever [[feature film]], ''[[The Orator (film)|The Orator]]'' (''O Le Tulafale''), was released in 2011. Shot and set in Samoa, in the [[Samoan language]], it features a Samoan cast. It was produced with financial support from the Samoan government, in the hopes of showcasing [[Culture of Samoa|Samoan culture]] to an international audience, and of promoting Samoa as a tourist destination.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_4005104"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/entertainment-news/first-ever-samoan-film-wraps-up-4005104 |title=First ever Samoan film wraps up |date=22 January 2011 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, Samoa had only produced short films. [[Tusi Tamasese]], the writer and director of ''The Orator'', had previously written and directed short film ''[[Sacred Spaces]]'' (''Va Tapuia''), which was screened in 2010 at the [[New Zealand International Film Festival]], then at the [[ImagineNative International Film Festival]] in Toronto, and the [[Hawaii International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mch.govt.nz/news-events/news/samoan-feature-film-first "Samoan Feature Film First"], New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 11 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Samoa has only one [[movie theater|cinema]], the Magik cinema, owned by [[Maposua Rudolf Keil]]. The screening of films there is [[Censorship in Samoa|subject to censorship]], and foreign films may be banned, in accordance with the ''Film Act'' 1978, for undermining the [[Christianity|Christian faith]] of viewers. Both ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'' and ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' have been banned from screening in Samoa's cinema, the latter for being "inappropriate and contradictory to Christian beliefs and Samoan culture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralianews.net.au/stories/200904/2557247.htm?desktop "Samoa bans 'Milk' film"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219112942/http://www.radioaustralianews.net.au/stories/200904/2557247.htm?desktop |date=19 February 2012 }}, ABC Radio Australia, 30 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="RNZI_24194"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=24194 |title=Samoa’s government censor bans Da Vinci Code film |date=21 May 2006 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Clone High''''' (occasionally referred to in the U.S. as '''''Clone High U.S.A.''''') is a Canadian–American [[adult]] [[list of animated television series|animated]] [[television series]] created by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Phil Lord]], [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller|Christopher Miller]] and [[Bill Lawrence (TV producer)|Bill Lawrence]]. The [[comedy]] centers on a [[high school]] populated by the [[Cloning|clones]] of famous historical figures. The show's central cast includes adolescent depictions of [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Joan of Arc]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[Cleopatra]]. The series also serves as a parody of [[teen drama]]s; every episode is introduced as a "[[very special episode]]".

Lord and Miller first developed the series' concept while at [[Dartmouth College]] in the 1990s, later pitching it to executives at American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], who ultimately decided to pass on the program. It was later purchased by [[cable television|cable]] channel [[MTV]], and was produced between 2002–03. The show's design is heavily stylized and its animation style limited, emphasizing humor and story over visuals. The ''Clone High'' theme song was written by [[Tommy Walter]] and performed by his [[alternative rock]] band [[Abandoned Pools]], who also provided much of the series' background music.

''Clone High'' first aired in its entirety on Canadian cable network [[Teletoon]] between 2002 and 2003, later debuting on MTV. It became embroiled in a controversy regarding its depiction of Gandhi soon afterward, which prompted hundreds in [[India]] to mount a [[hunger strike]] in response. Shortly after, MTV pulled the series, which had been receiving low ratings. ''Clone High'' attracted mixed reviews from television critics upon its premiere, but it has since received critical acclaim and a [[cult following]].

==Premise==
''Clone High'' is set in a [[high school]] in the fictional town of Exclamation, USA, that is secretly being run as an elaborate military experiment orchestrated by a [[Federal government of the United States|government office]] called the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures. The school is entirely populated by the [[cloning|clones]] of famous historical figures that have been created and raised with the intent of having their various strengths and abilities harnessed by the [[United States military]]. The [[school principal|principal]] of the high school, Cinnamon J. Scudworth, has his own plans for the clones, and secretly tries to undermine the wishes of the Board (Scudworth wants to use the clones to create a clone-themed amusement park, dubbed "Cloney Island", a decidedly less evil intention than that of the Board). He is assisted by his [[robot]] butler/[[School principal|vice principal]]/[[dehumidifier]], Mr. Butlertron (a parody of ''[[Mr. Belvedere]]''), who is programmed to call everyone "Wesley" and speak in two distinct intonations.

The main protagonists of ''Clone High'' are the clones of [[Abraham Lincoln]] (referred to as "Abe"), [[Joan of Arc]], and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Much of the plot of the show revolves around the attempts of Abe to woo the vain and promiscuous clone of [[Cleopatra]], while being oblivious to the fact that his friend Joan of Arc is attracted to him. Meanwhile, [[John F. Kennedy]]'s clone (referred to as "JFK"), a macho, narcissistic womanizer, is also attempting to win over Cleopatra and has a long-standing rivalry with Abe. Gandhi acts in many of the episodes as the comic relief. Also on a few occasions, the characters that we see learn most of "Life's Lessons" the hard way.

===Themes and style===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Thegrassyknollclonehigh.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The [[Grassy Knoll]], a reference to the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|JFK assassination]] [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theory]] about a second shooter, dubbed "[[Dealey Plaza#The "grassy knoll"|The Man on the Grassy Knoll]]". Notice the flag at half mast and JFK leaning over the car.]] --&gt;
While the clones derive many character qualities from their ancestors,&lt;ref name="Hal205"&gt;Erickson, 2005. p.205&lt;/ref&gt; much of the humor in the show comes from the large contrast between the personality of the clones and the actual values and legacy of the historical figures they are descended from. For instance, Gandhi is portrayed as a hyperactive jerk-with-a-heart-of-gold whose biggest dream is to be accepted by those around him, in contrast to his historical legacy of calm nonviolence. Abe Lincoln is similarly portrayed as weak and indecisive, completely lacking the resolve of the [[President of the United States|President]] whose DNA he shares. All of the clones are also given mis-matched [[foster parent]]s who have little in common with them. Gandhi's parents are a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] couple, while JFK is raised by a [[homosexuality|homosexual]], [[interracial couple]]; Joan's "foster grandpa" is an elderly blind musician similar to [[Ray Charles]] named Toots, a parody of the stereotypical [[wise old man]] role (and the [[magical negro]] role) found in many teen shows, and who begins many of his declarative sentences with the words, "Now, I may be blind, but I can see..." followed by a wise-sounding observation that has little or nothing to do with anything.

The show also includes humor based on the historical figures themselves. For example, the diner the clones frequent is called The Grassy Knoll, a reference to the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|JFK assassination]] [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theory]] about a second shooter, dubbed "[[Grassy knoll|The Man on the Grassy Knoll]]". Other references seen are the flag at The Grassy Knoll being permanently at [[half mast]] and the car on the roof of the diner containing the original JFK's body leaning over the edge. There are pictures of assassinations hanging on the walls of the restaurant, such as the famous [[:Image:The Assassination of President Lincoln - Currier and Ives.png|Currier and Ives print]] of the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln assassination]] (though this version is in color and considerably more graphic than the original print). The genetic ancestors of all of the five main clones died of similarly irregular causes: three assassinations, one execution and one suicide. Other historical figure-based humor includes offhand coincidental remarks to other students, such as Abe mentioning that the clone of [[Napoleon]] is so annoying because of "[[Napoleon complex|some kind of complex]]", or Gandhi telling [[Catherine the Great]] to "[[Legends of Catherine the Great|get off her high horse]]".

The show is also a [[parody]] of "issue" episodes of high-school themed comedies. Each episode is introduced as a "[[very special episode]]."&lt;ref name="Hal205"/&gt; Episodes center on various social issues, including Gandhi being shunned by his school for having [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD]] (because of misinformation about the disorder), parodying shows which tackle [[AIDS]] awareness (it even included a special guest celebrity who tries to educate the students). Other episodes tackle [[recreational drug use|drugs]] (smoking raisins), the environment, and underage drinking in a similarly ridiculous fashion. In a clear sign that it is parodying the high school genre, it even ends at [[prom]]: a stereotypical "high school show" ending. Even the prom is a joke however, as we learn it is only the Winter Prom.

There was a [[running gag]] that creators Phil Lord and Christopher Miller wanted to include in the show "where Clone High – being an exaggeration of typical high schools in teen dramas – would have many proms throughout the year".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Planned proms included "an Early Winter Prom, a Late Winter/Early Spring Prom, a Mid-Semester Prom, a Post-Prom Clean Up Prom, etc".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The only surviving references to this joke are the Homecoming Prom in episode 6, "Homecoming: A Shot in D'Arc", and the winter prom in episode 13, "Changes: The Big Prom: The Sex Romp: The Season Finale".&lt;ref name="pundog6"&gt;{{cite web | author=Pava, Adam | title=Episode Six: 'Homecoming: A Shot in the D'Arc' Notes | work=CloneHighUSA.com | url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_six.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030427125949/http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_six.html | archivedate=2003-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reference to the gag was deleted from episode 8, "A Room of One's Clone: Pie of the Storm".&lt;ref name="pundog6"/&gt;

Miller initially developed the show's premise while in college, initially imagining the clones would be at a university rather than high school.&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt; The series was originally developed in 2000 under the title ''Clone High School, USA!''. The production was overseen by [[ABC Studios#Touchstone Television|Touchstone Television]]. It was originally pitched to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], who purchased the show immediately but ultimately decided not to order it to series. Miller deemed it the "easiest pitch ever," considering the show's use of famous figures.&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt; Following Fox's rejection, MTV purchased the program in May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MTV set to attend 'Clone High'|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 3, 2001|author=Cynthia Littleton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_seven.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040215201829/http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_seven.html|archivedate=2004-02-15|website=CloneHighUSA.com|date=2004-02-25|accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the original character designs were much different from what they would become even though the characters kept the same physical attributes and appearance. Each episode was budgeted at approximately $750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/17/entertainment/et-solomon17|title=Freshman animators|website=articles.latimes.com|date=2003-02-27|accessdate=2011-07-27|first=Charles|last=Solomon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being an [[MTV]]/[[Teletoon]] Co-production, the show was co-produced with [[Touchstone Television]], marking as Disney's third adult animated series after ''[[The PJs]]'' and ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]''.

In forming the show's central cast, they found themselves limited in the number of historical figures they could depict, in consideration with avoiding "litigious estates" (such as the families of [[Albert Einstein]] or [[Marilyn Monroe]]) and keeping in mind the viewership of MTV.&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt; The show also parodies teen dramas, such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', which Lord and Miller watched in preparation to create the series.&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt; The show's art design has been described as angular and "evocative of [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] at its best."&lt;ref name="Hal205"/&gt; It is characterized by a flat and very stylized appearance resembling the animation used in [[Cartoon Network]] animated series from the 1990s and early 2000s, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' and ''[[Time Squad]]'' (Lord and Miller specifically cited ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' as an influence). The character designs were all done by Carey Yost, known for his work on ''Dexter's Laboratory'', ''Samurai Jack'', ''The Powerpuff Girls'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', and ''[[Timon &amp; Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon &amp; Pumbaa]]''. The characters and backgrounds were [[traditional animation|traditionally drawn]], and frames and cels were frequently recycled. Co-creator Chris Miller explained, "We like the snappy pose-to-pose animation, more for reasons of comic timing than anything else. Things that aren't expected are funnier: If an anvil's going to fall on your head, it had better not take more than three seconds. That's why we like the quick pose-to-pose stuff. For scenes with more emotional content, the characters move a little slower and more fluidly". Phil Lord added, "But we never want the viewer to be paying attention to the animation, because it's there to serve the jokes and the story. We strip out extraneous movements, because we don't want to draw your eye to anything that's not part of a joke." Gandhi is the most animated character on the show; he requires twice as many story-board poses as any other character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/funfacts/fun_facts.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602070504/http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/funfacts/fun_facts.html|archivedate=2008-06-02|title=Clone High Fun Facts|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was produced by [[Bill Lawrence (TV producer)|Bill Lawrence]], who also produced ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''[[Spin City]]'' and ''[[Cougar Town]]''. Many ''Scrubs'' alumni, such as [[Zach Braff]], [[Donald Faison]], [[Sarah Chalke]], [[John C. McGinley]], [[Neil Flynn]], and [[Christa Miller]], provided the voices of characters in ''Clone High''.

''Clone High'' was notable for subtle jokes hidden in the animation. There is an image of a [[dolphin]] hidden in almost every episode. The use of dolphins (sounds or images) would be later featured in Lord and Miller's later work. In the episode "Raisin the Stakes", there were numerous hidden messages, which appeared to be a parody of [[subliminal messaging]].

===Controversy and cancellation===
An article in ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' Magazine depicting [[Mahatma Gandhi]] being beaten up by a muscular man sparked outrage in India.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|author="" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHlhFghZ1gM |title=Clone High NEW Behind the Scenes Discussion |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Clone High'' was caught in a crossfire when citizens in the country conducted internet searches on the Maxim article but also found out about the show's Gandhi character on MTV's website. This sparked an outrage in India over the show's depiction of Gandhi.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; On January 30, 2003, the 55th anniversary of [[Attempts to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi's assassination]], approximately 150 protesters (including [[Member of Parliament#India|members of parliament]]) gathered in [[New Delhi]] and vowed to fast in response to ''Clone High''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ashok | last=Sharma | title=MTV's Gandhi 'insult' outrages Indian MPs | date=2003-01-31 | publisher=The Guardian | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jan/31/pressandpublishing.india | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Freston, the head of [[Viacom]] (owner of MTV), was visiting the network's India branch and was "trapped in the building," according to Miller. In 2014, he recalled that protestors "basically threatened that they'd revoke MTV's broadcasting license in India if they didn't take the show off the air".&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt;

MTV offered a quick apology, stating that "''Clone High'' was created and intended for an American audience", and "we recognize and respect that various cultures may view this programming differently, and we regret any offense taken by the content in the show".&lt;ref name="Grossberg"&gt;{{cite news | first=Josh | last=Grossberg | title=MTV Apologizes for Gandhi Goofing | date=2003-01-31 | publisher=E!

Lord and Miller's two potential versions of a second season included one that made no mention of Gandhi's absence, and another that revealed that the character was, in fact, a clone of actor [[Gary Coleman]] all along, and the show continued as normal. "We pitched that, and it went up to the top at Viacom again and it got a big no," he remembered.&lt;ref name="grantland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/phil-lord-and-chris-miller-of-the-lego-movie-look-back-on-clone-high-their-cult-classic-mtv-cartoon/|date=February 7, 2014|title=Phil Lord and Chris Miller of 'The Lego Movie' Look Back on 'Clone High,' Their Cult Classic MTV Cartoon|author=Amos Barshad|publisher=[[Grantland]]|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future===
Lord and Miller have since stated that they have "considered" a film adaptation of the series. In 2014, they explained that as they at that time were under contract with [[20th Century Fox Television|Fox]], Lawrence had a television deal at [[Warner Bros. Television]], and the rights to ''Clone High'' were owned by MTV/Viacom, it would be difficult to resurrect the show.&lt;ref name="collider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/clone-high-movie-phil-lord-chris-miller/|date=June 12, 2014|title=Phil Lord and Chris Miller Say They're Discussing the Possibility of a CLONE HIGH Movie; Talk Potential Rating and More|author=Adam Chitwood|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to ''Clone High'' are present in their later productions: the duo admitted many jokes in ''[[22 Jump Street]]'' were "ripped off straight from ''Clone High''", and Forte also voices a [[Lego]] version of Lincoln in ''[[The Lego Movie]]''.&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt; In a 2014 [[Grantland]] article, the two joked that "our entire career has just been about getting ''Clone High'' back on the air".&lt;ref name="grantland"/&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The previous animated MTV series ''[[Daria]]'' and ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' had used then-current [[popular music]] as a soundtrack, but, in contrast, ''Clone High'' featured a wide variety of music, usually exclusive to [[alternative rock]], [[indie rock]], [[midwest emo]], [[hardcore punk]] [[pop rock]], [[metalcore]], from mostly unknown and [[underground music|underground]] bands and musicians; a previous MTV animated series, ''[[Undergrads]]'', had also done this.

==Reception==

===Initial reviews===
Television critics gave ''Clone High'' mixed reviews upon its 2002 premiere. On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the show has a score of 60, based on seven reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Clone High, USA'' Reviews|url=http://metacritic.com/tv/clone-high-usa|publisher=[[Metacritic]] ([[CBS Interactive]])|accessdate=March 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Bianculli of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' praised the series, commenting, "In a year of variations and ripoffs of established themes and genres, it's a true original. It's also a cartoon, and is truly, outrageously bizarre."&lt;ref name="nydn"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anita Gates| title=This Class Is One For The History Books | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/class-history-books-article-1.672864|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=January 20, 2003 |accessdate=March 29, 2015|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''{{'s}} Rob Owen complimented the show: "Yes, ''Clone High'' has the MTV-requisite sexual innuendo, but it's more clever than much of what passes for humor in prime time today.

===Retrospective reviews===
Because of the series' early cancellation in 2003, it quickly fell into obscurity, especially in the US. However, it has garnered a large fanbase throughout the Internet and still occasionally airs reruns on [[Teletoon]]'s ''[[Teletoon at Night]]'' (formerly Teletoon Detour) block and formerly aired on [[MTV Canada|MTV]], [[MTV2 Canada|MTV2]] and [[MTV2 (Canada)|Razer]] (now MTV2) in Canada. [[MuchMusic|Much]] in Canada has also aired reruns of ''Clone High'' for a short time.

Heather Marulli, of the website [[Television Without Pity]], called the series "a mini-masterpiece of the animated genre; an opus to the primetime cartoon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marulli |first=Heather |title=Tonight, On A Very Special Clone High... |url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/brilliantbutcancelled/2009/12/tonight-on-a-very-special-clon.php |publisher=televisionwithoutpity.com |accessdate=2009-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205095712/http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/brilliantbutcancelled/2009/12/tonight-on-a-very-special-clon.php |archivedate=2009-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Broermann, from the website Freakin' Awesome Network, gave the series an "A+", saying it has "some really really good character development and depth" and an "amazing soundtrack" He notes the fantastic use of multiple running gags keeping viewers on their toes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Broermann |first=David| title=Dave the Dave's Review: Oh Wesley (Clone High) |url=http://www.freakinawesomenetwork.net/2011/09/dave-the-daves-review-review-oh-wesley/ |date=2011-09-10 |accessdate= 2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Corral de comedias''''', literally a "theatrical courtyard", is a type of open-air theatre specific to Spain. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] all secular plays were called ''comedias'', which embraced three genres: [[tragedy]], [[drama]], and [[comedy]] itself.  During the [[Spanish Golden Age]], ''corrals'' became popular sites for theatrical presentations in the early 16th century, when the theater took on a special importance in the country. The performance was held in the afternoon and lasted two to three hours, there being no intermission, and few breaks. The entertainment was continuous, including complete shows with parts sung and danced. All spectators were placed according to their sex and social status.

==History==
[[File:Almagro. Representación de "El médico a palos", de Molière.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Performance of ''[[Le Médecin malgré lui|El médico a palos]]'' by [[Molière]]]]
In modern times, the first buildings devoted to the theater in Spain appeared in the 16th century.  Representations of ''comedias'' were instead held in the courtyard of houses or inns where a stage with background scenery was improvised along one of the sides. The three remaining sides served as public galleries to the wealthy, with the remaining spectators watching the play from the open courtyard.
The courtyard structure was maintained in permanent theaters built for the purpose from the end of the sixteenth century, called ''corrales de comedias,'' which used the open-air enclosed rectangular courtyard typical of a block of houses.&lt;ref name=Haza&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~jmruano/Corral.html|title=El Corral del Príncipe (1583-1744)|accessdate=August 2013|last=Ruano de la Haza|first=José María|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playwrights and dramatists such as [[Lope de Vega]], [[Juan Pérez de Montalbán]], [[Tirso de Molina]], and [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] created works which were performed in ''corrales de comedias.''

The first permanent theater of this type, [[Teatro de la Cruz|Corral de la Cruz]], was constructed in [[Madrid]] in 1579. The number of theaters increased rapidly after 1600, responding to the public's enthusiasm for this new form of entertainment.&lt;ref name=nrt&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nrtarqueologos.com/noti_15vi2005.htm|accessdate=August 2013|title=Finalización de los trabajos arqueológicos en el Corral de Comedias de Torralba de Calatrava (Ciudad Real)|publisher=NRT Arqueólogos|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest surviving corral, albeit significantly altered, is the [[Corral de comedias de Alcalá de Henares]]. This ''corral'', formerly a courtyard theatre, has been roofed and used as a ''teatro romántico'' and a cinema, leading to major changes in the building's architecture.{{sfn|Coso Marín|Higuera Sánchez-Pardo|Sanz Ballesteros|1989|p=n.p.}}
The last known such courtyard theatre to be built in Spain, [[Corral de comedias de Almagro]], in  [[Almagro, Ciudad Real|Almagro]], [[Castile-La Mancha]],  is a purpose-built theater that dates to 1628.{{sfn|International Shakespeare Association. World Congress|2004|p=93}} This only functioning courtyard theater still standing, once one among the many, {{sfn|Congress|2004|p=92-93}} annually celebrates the ''Festival Internacional de Teatro Clásico'' (International Classical Theatre Festival);&lt;ref name=nrt/&gt; 
 
There are recently found remains of a corral in [[Torralba de Calatrava]],&lt;ref name=nrt/&gt; which the municipality wished to rebuild in 2006.&lt;ref name=uclm&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uclm.es/ceclm/librosnuevos/2006_enero/torralba.htm|title=El Patio de comedias de Torralba de Calatrava|last1 =Hervás Herrera |first1=Miguel Ángel |last2=Retuerce Velasco |first2=Manuel |last3=Sánchez de León Álvarez |first3=Maria Concepción|accessdate=August 2013|publisher=Centro de Estudios de Castilla-La Mancha. Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Corrales in the Americas===
The theatre type specific to Spain, was extended to [[Mexico]] when a ''corral de comedias'' was built in [[Tecali de Herrera]] around 1540.&lt;ref name=teran&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Terán Bonilla|first1=José Antonio|year=2010|title=El corral de comedias en Tecali de Herrera|publisher=Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México|language=Spanish|journal=Bitácora Arquitectura|pages=72–74|url=http://revistas.unam.mx/index.php/bitacora/article/download/25191/23679|accessdate=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=con&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sic.conaculta.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=teatro&amp;table_id=644|title=Teatro Gregorio de Gante|accessdate=March 2013|publisher=Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes de México|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parallels with the Elizabethan Theatre===
The ''corrales'' present some parallels to [[Elizabethan theatre]] where productions were held in galleried inns. The [[The George Inn, Southwark|George Inn, Southwark]] is a partially surviving example of such a structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fothergill-Payne|first1=Louise|last2=Fothergill-Payne|first2=Peter|title=Parallel Lives: Spanish and English National Drama, 1580-1680|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=372kPQd0q14C&amp;pg=PA45|year=1991|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=978-0-8387-5194-7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As well as similarities as regards the type of buildings used, there were similarities in the subject matter of the plays: Spanish literature was translated into English in Shakespeare´s time, and in 1613 his company mounted a lost play called ''[[Cardenio]]'' which appears to have been based on an episode in ''[[Don Quixote]]''. 

Although Shakespeare was not translated into Spanish until the eighteenth century, his work has since been performed in the corrales; for example in 2016, which saw the [[quatercentenary]] of the deaths of Cervantes and Shakespeare, there were Shakespearean productions in Amalgro and Alcalá de Henares.&lt;ref name="Luna"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lalunadealcala.com/shakespeare-trae-la-tempestad-al-corral-de-comedias-de-alcala/ | title=Shakespeare trae... | work=La Luna de Alcala | accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture and fittings==
[[File:Corral del Coliseo.JPG|thumb|220px|''[[Corral del Coliseo]]'' in Seville.]]
The stage was installed at one end of the court, against the back wall. In front of the stage was the outdoor patio at the end of which sat the so-called ''musketeers.'' The balconies and windows of the adjoining houses formed the quarters reserved for men and women of nobility. In Madrid, above the ''cazuela'', were the quarters of the councilors and other authorities, such as the chairman of the [[Council of Castile]].&lt;ref name=Corral&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corraldecomedias.com/|title=Compañia del Corral de Comedias de Almagro|accessdate=August 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the upper floors were the ''desvanes'' (attics), very small quarters, among which stood the [[tertulia]] of the church and a second ''cazuela.'' The stage and lateral galleries  were protected by an overhang. An [[awning]], hung from hooks, protected the men of the common public who sat in the patio from the sun, avoiding contrast between sunlit and shaded areas, such as was found on stage and in the courtyard. That probably also improved the acoustics of the venue, avoiding straining the voices of actors. This provision was similar to the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan theaters]] from the same period in England.&lt;ref name=Henares&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corraldealcala.com/|title=Teatro Corral de Comedias - Alcalá de Henares|accessdate=August 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier built corrals, there were no toilets: with the advent of "new enlightened governments" during the reign of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], some ''corrales'' were closed due to hygiene issues, risk of fire or disorder. With the arrival of a bourgeois class who did not want to watch the plays in awkward spaces such as these, larger theatrical structures were constructed, which required confined spaces and specific acoustic treatment.

==Performances==
During the Spanish Golden Age, any theatrical event was known as ''comedia''. The public came in masses for entertainments like this, whether comedy, drama or tragedy. The season of performances usually began on Easter Sunday, ending on Ash Wednesday. Smoking was forbidden because of the risk of fire, and from October to April the ''comedia'' began at two in the afternoon, in the spring at three and at four during summer, in order for all to finish before sunset. The performance's duration was approximately four to six hours, structured in six different rounds: the first act or ''[[Loa (Spanish play)|loa]]'', the opening round, then an appetizer, the second round, the masquerade or ''[[jácara]]s'', a third round and the final act. Men and women could not sit together; men occupied the courtyard, side stands, the benches or the central stands, and the women watched the performance from their ''cazuelas'' above. The only place where they were allowed to be together was in the chamber corridors. Children were not allowed to attend. The audience paid fees at different points: at the entrance, then a tip to the "brotherhood" or beneficiary, and a third one for the privilege of a seat so they could watch the play comfortably. The theatrical company rarely received as much as 20% of the total. In university towns, it was forbidden to perform on weekdays, so the students would not be distracted. Two characters were instantly recognized in the ''corrales'': the ''mozo'', maintainer of order, equipped with a big [[garrote]] to calm the exited spectator, and the "spacer", that is, the one in charge of finding a suitable place for an individual in between two others. The first regulation on the operation of corrals was published by the Royal Council of Castile for the ''corrales'' of Madrid, later extended to the whole kingdom.&lt;ref name=cot&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cotarelo y Mori|first=Emilio|year=2001|title=El corral de comedias de Almagro: construcción, propriedad e arrendamiento|language=Spanish|journal=Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia|volume=CXCVIII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkC4xH3-mZoC&amp;pg=PA519|accessdate=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its provisions, were the presence of a [[bailiff]] whose function was to ensure that no noise, tumults, or scandals ensued, and that men and women were kept separated in their respective seating by the required entrances and exits.&lt;ref name="cot"/&gt;{{sfn|Peláez Martín|2002|p=n.s.}}

A '''drag show''' is an entertainment which is performed by [[drag (clothing)|drag]] artists, both women and men.

Many drag shows feature performers singing or [[Lip sync|lip-synching]] to songs while performing a pre-planned [[pantomime]], or dancing. The performers often don elaborate costumes and makeup, and sometimes dress to imitate various famous opposite sex singers or personalities. And some events are centered around drag, such as [[Southern Decadence]] where the majority of festivities are led by the Grand Marshals, who are traditionally [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southerndecadence.net |title=Southern Decadence Official Website |publisher=Southerndecadence.net |date=2013-09-03 |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many drag performances have an agenda, whether it be through camp or comedy they often resist the hegemony by rejecting notions of heterosexism. Although drag performers are rejecting heterosexism they often times reinforce classism, racism, and sexism in their performances.&lt;ref&gt;Underwood, Lisa. The Drag Queen Anthology : The Absolutely Fabulous but Flawlessly Customary World of Female Impersonators, Routledge, 2004. ProQuest Ebook Central, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/conncoll/detail.action?docID=1111319&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
The first instances of drag were well before drag shows began. In England and China in the 1500's women were not allowed to participate in drama or theater so the men impersonated females when acting on stage.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Halberstam, Judith. “Mackdaddy, Superfly, Rapper: Gender, Race, and Masculinity in the Drag King Scene.” ''Social Text'', no. 52/53, 1997, pp. 105–131. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/466736.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Victorian period English actresses impersonated men in theater, and in America actresses like Anne Hindle also impersonated men in her performances. She had a low voice and shaved regularly to create an masculine appearance.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The impersonation of the opposite sex was popular in theater and film until 1933 when the Hollywood [[Motion Picture Production Code]] was passed.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This law or code was established to eliminate perversion which temporarily ended the era of male impersonation in film and theater. 

The first known drag balls of the United States were in Harlem in the 1920's, at the Rockland Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, James F. “‘That’s the Kind of Gal I Am’: Drag Balls, ‘Sexual Perversion,’ and David Belasco’s Lulu Belle.” ''Bulldaggers, Pansies, and Chocolate Babies: Performance, Race, and Sexuality in the Harlem Renaissance'', University of Michigan Press, ANN ARBOR, 2010, pp. 79–111. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.1175684.6.&lt;/ref&gt; These shows are called balls and feature extravagant performances of gay's and lesbian's impersonating the opposite sex and competing against one another in fashion shows. It is important to note that Harlem drag balls were primarily people of color, white people were not excluded but did not typically participate. Drag balls were social event that brought people together who were on the margins of society and they often had to meet in secret.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, James F. “‘That’s the Kind of Gal I Am’: Drag Balls, ‘Sexual Perversion,’ and David Belasco’s Lulu Belle.” ''Bulldaggers, Pansies, and Chocolate Babies: Performance, Race, and Sexuality in the Harlem Renaissance'', University of Michigan Press, ANN ARBOR, 2010, pp. 79–111. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.1175684.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of the [[Harlem Renaissance]] like [[Gladys Bentley]], a prominent Blues singer, regularly wore tuxedos and dressed in mens clothing while performing.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Butch African American women constructed their own forms of masculinity inside and outside of Blues performances which set the stage for future performers in drag. It wasn't until about 50 years later that the term drag king was coined and performances started popping up across the United States. According to Elizabeth Ashburn, "A drag king is anyone, regardless of gender or sexual preference or orientation, who consciously makes a performance of masculinity."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glbtqarchive.com/arts/drag_kings_A.pdf|title=Drag Shows: Drag Kings and Male Impersonators|last=Ashburn|first=Elizabeth|date=2015|website=GLBTQ Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore drag performers of the drag king scene typically identify as women but some may be cisgender men or transgender men.

During World War II, parody drag shows were also a regular kind of entertainment for soldiers who dressed up as humorous-looking women and put on shows for each other.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Kaminski, Elizabeth, and Verta Taylor. “‘We’Re Not Just Lip-Synching Up Here’: Music and Collective Identity in Drag Performances.” ''Identity Work in Social Movements'', edited by Jo Reger et al., NED - New edition ed., vol. 30, University of Minnesota Press, 2008, pp. 47–76. ''JSTOR'', www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttt85v.6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Jewel Box Revue ===
Doc Benner, and Danny Brown produced the show which started in Miami, Florida at a gay bar known as Club Jewel Box.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Coleman, B. (1997). The Jewel Box Revue: America's Longest-Running, Touring Drag Show. ''Theatre History Studies,'' ''17'', 79-91.&lt;/ref&gt; This show would go on to set the stage for the touring drag show known as the Jewel Box Revue. The Jewel Box Revue was the longest running drag show that performed from the 1940's until the 1970's across the United States. They had at least ten specific performances in their repertoire, which was helpful for shows that ran for longer periods of time at the same place.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;The show had their own music and dances that were composed and choreographed for performers, they also did comedy sketches and some stand-up performances.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The revue was made up of a diverse group that included African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and whites, which was unusual for the times before the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]]. 

Many of the venues they performed at were part of the "[[Chitlin' Circuit|chitlin' circuit]]", the [[Howard Theatre]] (Washington D.C.) , the Baltimore-Royal Theatre, [[Uptown Theater (Philadelphia)|Uptown Theatre]] (Philadelphia) and the [[Regal Theater, Chicago|Regal Theater]] in Chicago. In 1959 they began performing at [[Apollo Theater|The Apollo Theater]] in New York City and it was always a full house when they came to town.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 

In the 1960's laws and regulations were put in place against cross-dressing and the Jewel Box Revue slowed down a bit. Although places like Los Angeles had bans in place they were still allowed to play at certain theaters.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Ultimately the laws and regulations against cross-dressing made it difficult for the Jewel Box Revue to perform. 

In 1975, the Jewel Box Revue performed for the last time in a production at the Bijou Theater in New York City.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  

=== Pearl Box Revue ===
In 1955 the Pearl Box Revue began it's performances in New York City. Pearl Box Revue was an all Black drag show that ran for twenty seven years until 1982.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Dorian Corey]] was a performer in the Pearl Box Revue and also one of the drag queens in the documentary by [[Jennie Livingston]] known as ''Paris is Burning.''&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Disposable Boy Toys ===
Disposable Boy Toys (DBT) were a drag king group out of Santa Barbara, California&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Shapiro, Eve. “Drag Kinging and the Transformation of Gender Identities.” ''Gender and Society'', vol. 21, no. 2, 2007, pp. 250–271. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/27640961.&lt;/ref&gt;. The group was started in May of 2000 and had 31 members, mostly white, queer and transgender, and were a feminist collective.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Their performances were centered on dismantling racism, sexism, gender binaries, ideal bodies and even militarism and they mostly performed in queer spaces or progressive spaces for fundraising and marches&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Lip synching and dancing were regular components of their shows. DBT was known for performing at benefits to raise money for political and community causes.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

DBT disbanded in August of 2004, and although they did not officially break up they never performed together again.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===[[After Dark (drag act)|After Dark]]===
''After Dark'' was a Swedish group founded in 1976 which performed for over 40 years, mostly in Sweden, but intermittantly also in the United States and Spain.

== Provincetown, MA. ==
[[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]], Massachusetts is home to some of the most famous drag performers and in the summers months there are several performances on any given night. On July 24th 2018, Provincetown was home to the first ever Drag Camp, a camp for drag performers to hone in on their skills and perform for lives audiences.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hornet.com/stories/provincetowns-family-week-2018-will-feature-inaugural/|title=Provincetown Will Host the First-Ever 'Drag Camp' Featuring Some of the World's Most Famous Queens|date=2018-07-17|work=Hornet Stories|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp lasted for two weeks (until August 4th 2018) and showcased famous drag performers.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [[Jinkx Monsoon]], [[Peaches Christ]], and [[Raja (drag queen)|Raja]] were some of the most famous drag performers who attended Drag Camp and had their own workshops sessions on how to apply makeup, or comedic performance, amongst many others.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The drag performances in Provincetown, also known as Ptown, are legendary, hence why Drag Camp landed there.

== Popular Culture ==
Drag shows have become more popular with the documentary ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris is Burning]],'' and shows like ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race|Rupaul's Drag Race]].'' Films such as ''The Birdcage'' and ''Too Wong Fu, Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar'' have popularized drag culture too.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These films along with Rupaul's Drag Race have a large heterosexual fanbase.  

== Drag Brunch ==
A '''Drag Brunch''' is a type of drag show, in which [[Drag king|drag kings]] and [[Drag queen|drag queens]] perform for an audience while the audience feasts on typical brunch foods and drinks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foodandwine.com/news/drag-brunch-history-nyc|title=The Importance of Drag Brunch in NYC|work=Food &amp; Wine|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Brunch|last=Jordan|first=Susan|date=2014|work=Empty Closet|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is typically held at LGBTQ bars and nightclubs, restaurants have also become a popular site for drag brunches.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article167129652.html|title=South End club will become Charlotte’s first drag queen restaurant|work=charlotteobserver|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drag brunch is especially popular in urban centers with large gay populations, such as cities like [[New York City]], [[Miami]], [[Atlanta]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Quebec]], and [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Drag historian and New York University professor, Joe E. Jeffreys, believes that drag brunch’s rise in popularity in recent years, is due to LGBTQ venues, such as Lucky Cheng’s, Lips NYC, and Club 82, that arose between the 1950s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In an article titled "The Importance of Drag Brunch in NYC", Jeffery's claimed that these venues have the ability to expose people to drag, who might not have encountered it before.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

“[People] are able to sit at drag brunch and have a lovely spinach frittata and Bloody Mary while learning this lesson through observation. They start to understand that gender and drag aren't these scary things,” said Jeffreys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thrillist.com/lifestyle/new-york/best-drag-shows-nyc|title=The Best Places to Catch Live Drag Shows in New York City|last=Kravitz|first=Melissa|date=2018-04-16|work=Thrillist|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; “It’s fun and festive like brunch can be.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In an articled titled "Dragging Herself To Brunch," Shawn Bodey, also known by his drag persona Robin Banks, describes drag brunch as dinner theater but for brunch.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/dragging_herself_to_brunch/|title=Dragging Herself To Brunch  {{!}}  New Haven Independent|date=2015-06-19|work=New Haven Independent|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bodey, dancing, singing and jokes about the [[gender binary]], are some of the things one could expect to see at a drag brunch.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Drag Brunch.jpg|thumb|South Beach brunch and drag show during memorial weekend]]

=== Gospel Drag Brunch ===

In cities across the country gospel drag brunches are also becoming increasingly popular. The drag venue Lips, which is based in New York City but has locations across the country, first started gospel drag brunches in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 2007.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://southfloridagaynews.com/Food-and-Dining/lips-gospel-brunch-drag-for-jesus.html|title=Lips Gospel Brunch: Drag for Jesus|last=Fortino|first=A.

(2016). Brunch at Lips is such a Drag!. ''Hotspots Magazine'', ''3124''112-113.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article titled "Lips Gospel Brunch: Drag for Jesus," gospel drag brunch performer Nicolette describes the event as "cross-dressing for Jesus."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''''Driver 3''''' (stylized as '''''DRIV3R''''') is a 2004 [[open world]] action-adventure [[video game]]. It is the third installment in the [[Driver (series)|''Driver'' series]] and was developed by [[Ubisoft Reflections|Reflections Interactive]] and published by [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari, Inc.]]. ''Driver 3'' was released in North America for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] on 21 June 2004. In Europe, it was released on 25 June, although due to the way Atari shipped the title across the continent, it made its way into independent [[United Kingdom|UK]] retailers before the release date, reaching sixth place in the [[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association|ELSPA]] chart for that week. A simplified version of the game for mobile phones was developed and released by [[Sorrent]] and published in North America on 23 June 2004, while it was published by Unique Games in Europe. On 15 March 2005, it was released on [[Personal computer|PC]] for US customers, it was also released on [[Game Boy Advance]] 25 October 2005. At one point a [[Nintendo GameCube]] version and an [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] version were planned, but both were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Driv3r exclusive - creative director Martin Edmonson talks!|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=101443|accessdate=15 April 2016|date=16 February 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107075941/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=101443 |archivedate=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game received mixed reviews on all platforms except the PC, which received mostly unfavorable reviews.

Although two ''Driver'' games were published between them, 2011's ''[[Driver: San Francisco]]'' is considered the sequel to ''Driver 3''.

==Gameplay==
{{original research section|date=June 2018}}
The vehicles in ''Driver 3'' are based on real-life [[vehicles]] and are designed to behave as such, using realistic damage modeling (e.g., bullet holes appear when a car is shot, or if the car is hit from behind the trunk of the car will pop out).

Weapons are unnamed in the game, with weapons beyond the player's initial weapon unlocked by completing mission or, in Take A Ride mode, from stealing them from police or other enemies. The players can unlock a variety of weapons, including pistols, rifles, and grenade guns.

NPCs react to the player's actions. For example, pedestrians will flee if they see Tanner with a weapon or if he drives too close to them.

==Plot==
A shootout occurs in [[Istanbul|Istanbul, Turkey]] between FBI agent John Tanner, a South Beach cartel agent named Jericho, and the police. Tanner and Jericho shoot each other.

[[Flashback (narrative)|Six months earlier]] in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]], Tanner is tasked by the [[Miami Police Department]] to infiltrate a crime syndicate called South Beach, headed by a woman named Calita. He works undercover as a [[getaway driver]] in South Beach, catching a man named Baccus and is involved with the apparent death of a man called The Gator.

Tanner leaves for [[Nice, France]] with South Beach. There he meets two [[Interpol]] agents, Henri Vauban and Didier Dubois, who are also working against South Beach. Tanner decides to pursue his case on his own terms. The Interpol agents accidentally spoil Tanner's cover, and he is ambushed by Jericho. Tanner escapes with his partner, Tobias Jones, but Jericho kills Dubois.

In Istanbul, Turkey, Tanner is now working as a rogue agent due to the incident with Interpol and being subsequently framed for the murder of Dubois. Tanner continues to work against South Beach operations. As he does, he learns Jericho is the real leader of the crime ring. Jericho is involved in a car chase with the Turkish police, and Tanner catches up to Jericho. Jericho is shot by Tanner, but Tanner refuses to execute Jericho; Jericho takes the opportunity to shoot Tanner in the back. Tanner is rushed to the emergency room, where he [[asystole|flatlines]]. The doctors attempt to resuscitate him.

==Development==
The game was in [[Video game development|development]] for around three and a half years. Special attention was paid in rendering the cities of [[Miami]], [[Nice]], and [[Istanbul]]. The in-game music was composed by Marc Canham, Rich Aitken, and Narco.

Atari also shot a short [[Trailer (promotion)|promotional video]] about ''Driver 3'' called ''Run the Gauntlet''.

The PlayStation 2 version of ''Driver 3'' received a "Platinum" sales award from the [[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] (ELSPA),&lt;ref name=platinumelspa&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515224703/http://www.elspa.com/?i=3944 |url=http://www.elspa.com:80/?i=3944 |title=ELSPA Sales Awards: Platinum |work=[[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] |archivedate=15 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=gamasutrasales&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918063107/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |title=ELSPA: ''Wii Fit'', ''Mario Kart'' Reach Diamond Status In UK | author=Caoili, Eric | date=26 November 2008 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |archivedate=18 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an extensive and intensive promotional campaign, ''Driver 3'' received "mixed" reviews on all platforms except the PC version, which received "generally unfavorable reviews", according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MCGBA/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPC/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPS2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCXB/&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' gave it all five stars, saying, "The graphics are divine, with vast urban locales and spectacular crashes. The cars handle well, and each vehicle has its own characteristics. Yet this is no easy driving game — one of the reasons why, subject matter aside, it carries a 16+ rating."&lt;ref name=TheTimes/&gt; ''[[Playboy]]'' gave it an 88% and stated: "Your investigation jump-starts reckless car chases through more than 150 miles of highways and city streets in detailed re-creations of Miami, Nice and Istanbul. Slam into any of the 30,000 buildings and your car crumbles realistically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=DRIV3R (PS2, Xbox) | magazine=[[Playboy]] | date=April 2004 | page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' gave it three stars out of five and called its controls and animation "unresponsive and stiff".&lt;ref name=Cincinnati/&gt;

==="DRIV3Rgate"===
While ''Driver 3'' received mostly mixed reviews, two outlets operated by [[Future plc]], ''[[PSM3|PSM2]]'' and ''[[Xbox World]]'', gave the game 9/10 scores.&lt;ref name=MCPS2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCXB/&gt; This disparity led some gamers and journalists to claim that the [[early access]] Atari gave Future was contingent on receiving favorable ratings, but Atari and Future denied any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="D3CheatSheet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-04-26-franchise-cheat-sheet-driver-article | title=Franchise Cheat Sheet: Driver | publisher=GamesIndustry.biz | date=3 May 2011 | accessdate=29 June 2016 | last1=Whitehead |first1=Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCWorldGate"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lui|first1=Spandas|title=A history of gaming's biggest scandals|url=http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/341103/history_gaming_biggest_scandals/?pp=2|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was dubbed "Driv3rgate".&lt;ref name="PCWorldGate"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahey|first1=Rob|title=A Question of Trust|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/a-question-of-trust|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the accusations of review fixing arose, the [[GamesRadar]] forums (also operated by Future) were filled with critical posts, many of which were deleted by moderators. Although the comments were said to be removed for being libelous, some users suspected a cover-up.&lt;ref name="D3CheatSheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCWorldGate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldofStuartDriverGate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/drivergate/drivergate.htm | title=Driv3r and corruption, continued |access-date=29 June 2016 |author=[[Stuart Campbell (game journalist)|Campbell, Stuart]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some comments defending ''Driver 3'' and Future were traced by forum moderators to Babel Media, a marketing company that made use of [[astroturfing]].&lt;ref name="WorldofStuartDriverGate"/&gt; The users admitted they worked for Babel, but said that they were posting on their own behalf, not for Babel.&lt;ref name="WorldofStuartDriverGate"/&gt; The thread was eventually deleted in its entirety.&lt;ref name="WorldofStuartDriverGate"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">'''Magic Youth International''' (M.Y.I.) was the highly respected junior branch of the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]] (I.B.M.). The global membership of the I.B.M. actively supported this dynamic youth-focused program to promote, educate and enhance the activities of young magicians around the world.

Magic Youth International was founded in 1955 by Robert J. Watson and Keith Halbasch, two Chicago teenage magicians. As a correspondence club, teen members shared their magic-related ideas, skills and experiences through personal letters. The letters were compiled into a newsletter called ''PIPS''.

With college looming in 1959, Robert and Keith released full control of the club to their adult adviser and magic peer Jess James. Under James' management, the club spread to cities across the Midwest United States.

In 1963, [[Dale Salwak]] organized a competing Indiana-based teen magic correspondence club called the Magic Club of America (M.C.A.) Fellow Hoosiers Steve Kelley and Greg Heeter formed a cooperative club called the International Club of Magic (I.C.M.) featuring their teen magic journal ''Top Hat''.

The three clubs merged in 1966 under Mr. James' Magic Youth International banner retaining the popular ''Top Hat'' as the official club journal. This merger made Magic Youth International the third largest magic club in the United States behind the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]] and the [[Society of American Magicians]] (S.A.M.)

The I.B.M. created a youth membership in 1994. International President John R. Brown III and Youth Committee chairman Steve Burton led the adoption of Magic Youth International as the official I.B.M. youth branch in 1998.

The I.B.M. executive board reorganized and renamed M.Y.I. as I.B.M. Youth in 2012. This stellar program continues to serve as an educational and social network for magicians and magic enthusiasts between the ages of 7 through 17 years.  I.B.M. Youth has chapters around the world generally affiliated with adult I.B.M. chapters (called Rings).

When a member turns 18, he or she graduates to full membership in the International Brotherhood of Magicians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20258">'''Immersive theater''' (or '''interactive theater''') differentiates itself from traditional theater by removing the stage and immersing audiences within the performance itself. Often, this is accomplished by using a specific location (''site-specific''), allowing audiences to converse with the actors and interact with their surroundings (''interactive''), and/or providing agency to the participant to change the narrative (''choose-your-own-adventure''). Modern forms of immersive theater have a wide range of definitions, all based upon the degree and type of engagement found between actors and their audience. There has been considerable debate amongst critics concerning these definitions of interaction,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bouko|first=Catherine|date=May 2014|title=Interactivity and Immersion in a media-based performance|url=|journal=Participations: Journal of Audience and Reception Studies|volume=11|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the heart of which are concepts such as audience influence, participation, social constructs and roles, and involvement, all depending on the degree of involvement needed for the works progression. Although many critics argue that all art incorporates a certain level of collaboration between its creator and its viewer, immersive theater differs in that audience members are expected to play some level of an active role in the creative process of the work. Immersive theater can take many forms depending on the degree of involvement of the audience, ranging from open acknowledgment of the audience's presence, to the audience's complete freedom of choice in determining the narrative.

Interactivity in immersive theater is most successful when the appropriate balance of creative freedom of the audience members and narrative structures placed upon them exists.

==Context==
Scholarly analysis of immersive theater is often Eurocentric: three main steps are often identified for creating an immersive and participatory theater experience:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

# Disintegration of the barrier between audience and actors
# Placement of audience members into the narrative of the work
# Removal of social structures dividing known constructs from imagined ones/lack of constructs.

One way immersion and interaction is achieved is through the use of "polychronic narrative".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is a narrative in which the participant&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; does not play a main role, as placing them in that position would involve too much volatility and freedom, preventing the telling of a structured story. Instead, the participant is given certain prescribed moments of actions and input. These moments do affect the narrative, but do so in a manner that is more impactful on the participant than any other aspect of the play. Participants are encouraged to be a part of the play, but not a deciding factor. Another way to achieve immersion is by using the word "you" when addressing the participant. This allows for the assigned role within the play to mesh with the actual social role of the participant, blurring the lines of reality. It also allows for a certain amount of ambiguity, as specific attributes such as age, gender, and profession are left unaddressed, and open to relative interpretation. The use of suspense and anxiety can be used to guide an individual participant through a narrative. By removing the participant from their comfort zone, their actions and reactions become influenced by both their instincts and the prompts given to them by the actors. This is used to attain believable reactions from a participant, in addition to maintaining order and structure needed to advance a storyline.

Immersive plays use different types of environments, from large multi-leveled buildings to open areas.  The different environments enhances the audience's involvement in the play, by giving them choices of how they want to participate in the theater. Inside the different personalized spaces, the audience can move from room to room. In some immersive plays the interiors can be set up on different levels, where each room can be an entirely different scene of the play.  Rooms can be dark, bright, colorful, cold, warm, scented, and crammed in order to accomplish an ambiance desired by the actors. By using light colors which correspond to specific emotions, the actors can capture spectators moods before a word is spoken or movement executed. Space is a powerful tool wielded by the actors in order to change audience's point of views.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Gareth|date=4 September 2012|title=On Immersive Theatre|url=|journal=Theatre Research International|volume= 37| issue =  03|pages=221–235|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to many theater theorists, four major components make the audience feel more integrated into theater performances: "real space,"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; sense, movement, and time. "Real Space"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; is a component of immersive theater, and actual space is a part of the staged play. If the play is set in a castle, audiences would go to real castle and have people watch it there in order for them to get feeling of being immersed in the theatrical performance. Engaging the senses, such as blindfolding the audience, can heighten the sense of hearing sound. Movement can effect how audiences perceive plot—moving around the theater space immerses the kinesthetic sense. A sense of time can be engaged by creating a sense of time that precedes and post-dates the play.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sakellaridou|first=Elizabeth|date=|title=Oh My God, Audience Participation! : Some Twenty-First-Centaury Reflections|url=|journal=Comparative Drama|volume= 48| issue = 1&amp; 2|pages=13–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
===Teen Interactive Theater Education ===
The Teen Interactive Theater Education (TITE) program was established in 2007 to measure the level of decision making skills and adolescent risk behaviors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson, Ryan J, et al.|first=|date=2016|title=Reducing Youth  Risk Behaviors Through Interactive Theater Intervention|url=|journal=Journal of Human Sciences and Extension|volume=4, #1|pages=70–77|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TITE program uses performance, role play and peer education to educate youth on making healthier decision. TITE youth participants do several educational performances to deliver information to youth. Teen participants teach other teen about risk prevention through performances. Lessons include the importance of avoiding risky behaviors, improving risk-avoidance skills and knowledge of the consequences of risky behaviors. The objective is to help youth understand risks and the positive effects of decision making skills. Theater provides participating youth with immersive experience focusing on "team building activities, experimental learning opportunities which will contribute in developing life skills, critical thinking, relationships and values." A total of 127 students participated and result found that most students reported an increase in knowledge, abilities and belief due to intervention; some reported less overall learning. Research shows that this program can reduce youth risk behavior to improve overall decision-making skills for youth participants, and improve the way the youth approached decision-making process. Decision-making skills increased for participants. Youth who reported more learning as a result of intervention were more likely to have better outcomes in decision-making than those who reported after they participated in the intervention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== John Brown at the NMAH  ===
The [[National Museum of American History]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] created an immersive theater about [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|John Brown]] that explores historical memory and reflection. An "Arbiter",&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Susan|date=2013|title=Personal Beliefs and National Stories: Theater in Museums as a Tool for Exploring Historical Memory|url=|journal=Curator: The Museum Journal|volume=56| issue =  2|pages=189–197|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or curator, explains the historical trail of John Brown to visitors. The museum can be a theater where the audience surrounds themselves in the story that involves a historical figure. Theater in museums can help "engage in public on the profound issues of national importance"&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; of the complexity of history." Museums can use immersive techniques to allow audiences to feel like they are immersing themselves in someone's story, to create empathy towards others. Immersive museum exhibits submerge audiences into the story by not only looking at the exhibit but to also being a part of the exhibit and participating in the exhibit at the museum.

===RATS Theatre, Sweden===
In 2008 RATS Theatre translated the play ''Antigone'' into an immersive radio drama to teach lessons in democracy and decision making to youths.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MANILLA ERNST AND WILLMAR SAUTER|first=|date=|title=Antigone's Diary – Young Audiences as Co-creators of GPS-guided Radio Drama|url=|journal=Nordic Theatre Studies|volume= 27: no. 1|pages=32–41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rats used computer technology to elicit feedback from the audience to improve future performances. Rats built two different theatres to hold their shows, one in Husby and the other in Kista (Both cities in Sweden). Husby is in a lower income area and Kista is in a higher income area, which helped them reach out to the youths of two completely different communities. This was important because they were able to use their program to help educate youths. All performances took place in an immigrant suburb, and the interactive decision making gave these students an important lesson in democracy—showing them the democratic process of public decision making.  In Husby, 84% of the inhabitants are either not born in Sweden or children of immigrant parents. Inputs from teens was optional but encouraged in order to get more information for the future productions. The RATS program has now expanded into Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. With the goal of helping teens getting involved in theatre can have their opinions help shape the future.

The mixture of interaction and the performance of the story triggers both emotional and cognitive feelings for young audiences. The ability to engage through text messages kept the audience involved while questions provoked deep thought. This cognitive process can improve lives. By the students learning how to use their opinions to shape performances they can also use their opinions to shape society. They can do this by voting in elections, becoming a teacher and most importantly working within the arts. All of these possible options would help continue to shape society in a positive way just as they did when they were motivated by the RATS program.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Future Trends==
[[Virtual reality]] in immersive theater consists of traditional story and filmic elements: plot, conflict, protagonist, antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Storytelling for Virtual Reality: Methods and Principles for Crafting Immersive Narratives|last=Bucher|first=John|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=|location=NY|pages=133–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtual reality is a new way of establishing the protagonist: the user can customize the protagonist in detail to how he or she would like and make the different decisions they think best for the plotline. Virtual reality in immersive storytelling enhances the message the author is trying to convey. VR uses lighting, dialogue, and positioning to immerse players. By being immersed, the player / protagonist undergoes two different types of goals, the external and internal. Virtual technology enhances the immersive theater setting, while staying true to aspects of original theater. The audience will experience the story as if they are a part of the story, following the main character or protagonist on a pathway to achieve their goal. The external goal is whether or not the protagonist physically finds a solution to their conflict while the internal goal is a goal within the protagonist's moral self and emotions.

Virtual reality allows viewers to become fully immersed into a traditional story world, immersing the audience into the storyline.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creating Narrative Structures: Storytelling for Virtual Reality Methods and Principles for Crafting Immersive Narratives|last=Bucher|first=John|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=978-1-138-62965-3|location=NY|pages=158–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; When creating a story through the virtual reality experience, the viewer can change the plot, which usually begins through a traditional inciting incident or catalyst. Through metaphor, characters can illustrate to the audience the plot. Instead of verbally displaying this, it is displayed physically as well from facial expressions and actions. Symbolic objects are important representations used to advance the plot. Irony is displayed through external narrative (wants/desires) and internal narrative (needs). In VR storytelling, there can be many endings: positive ending, where main character gets what they want and need; positive irony is when the main character gets what they need but not what they want'';'' negative irony is when the character gets what they want but not what they need; a negative ending is the conclusion of a main character not getting what they want or need. As the viewer begins the VR story, the plot contains these traditional components: magical opportunity, test, enemy, a missing piece. A magical opportunity allows for the viewer in virtual reality to make choices about using magic in order to help them on their journey. The test challenges the viewer by threatening to take away a part of their identity.  The viewer must confront an enemy. The missing piece usually is depicted through a person as an obstacle. This is often correlated to a theme where the main character must realize that "missing pieces" are not objects that can be easily obtained. At the end of the story, the main character must renounce their magical abilities or magic.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The use of digital technology can create an experimental and immersive version of older plays, like the 16th century Chinese play: "[[The Peony Pavilion]]."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/|title=Interactive Dramaturgy for Chinese Kunqu Opera: The Peony Pavilion|last=Feng|first=Qianhui|date=September 18, 2017|website=interactivearchitecture.org|archive-url=http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This immersive project, titled ''Inner Awareness: The Dream of Du Linang'', conveys transcendent concepts to the audience using spatial relations dependent on the bodies of audience members by means of digital technology. Digital technology like motion tracking technologies, and computer generated visual effects are used to immerse audiences. The purpose of using such technologies is to immerse the audience in the tactile sequences in the play, utilizing real actors in conjunction with motion tracking and mapping to generate a holographic effect, performing alongside the actors. This digital immersion seeks to recreate a classical Chinese garden as a space for the audience to walk around and experience the play. The spatial relations of the garden allow the audience to fill the void with subjective personal experiences and memory, creating a unique experience for each audience member. The recreation of the garden is digital, using real photographs of an actual garden serving as the basis and overlaying them with computer generated effects. The digital immersive garden is a way to tell the story using the concept of space, which is intended to immerse the audience in the illusory nature of the play. In addition, the figure of each audience member will be traced and projected, creating personal interaction. The audience is encouraged to create movement for their digital bodies, which further immerses the audience{{mdash}}they become part of the play.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Politics and Theater ==
In 1992 a local Brazilian theatre practitioner named Augusto Boal announced that he was running for the role of commissioner (mayor) and won the election using the slogan "Have the courage to be happy."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heritage|first=Paul|date=Fall 1994|title=The courage to be happy: Augusto Boal, legislative theatre, and the 7th International Festival of the Theatre of the Oppressed|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/|journal=MIT Press Journals|volume=|pages=|via=From Literature Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augusto employed five full-time actors and ten part-time actors to aid in his "street theatre style, which was based on the idea of providing interactive theatrical performances to the impoverished parts of Rio in an effort to convey political policies through the art of acting on a interpersonal level and to boost morale within poor neighborhoods through media that is very often unattainable to the general working class. "We use theatre to discuss problems of communities, workers, Blacks, women, street children, the unemployed, the homeless, etc. We don't want a passive audience, simply watching. We propose, on the contrary , that the public participate, interfere, enter on to the stage and propose alternatives for the plot: create a new story…Theatre is political and politics is theatre." Boal's stated goal was to use theater to change the political world, not to have the political world make him change. His idea of "legislative theatre" changed Brazilian political style, and would later become a style of art used internationally to advocate for social organizations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
Theatrical areas that are off-limits can add incentive for some audiences to explore.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alston|first=A|date=2016|title=Making Mistakes in Immersive Theatre: Spectatorship and Errant Immersion.|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary Drama in English|volume=4 |issue=1|pages=61–73|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, set designers often fail to plan for the possibilities and dangers of audiences going off-script to explore during performances. Audiences that participate in immersive theater are prohibited from entering restricted areas but the desire to go in a restricted area is not the failure of the audience's engagement, but an enhancement to the overall experience for immersive theater. Interacting with restricted areas can add a new perspective to immersive theatre. One example of restricted space is a performance conducted in various rooms at the Somerset House and King's College London. Audience members encountered a sign during the performance labeled, "DO NOT ENTER." It was clear that the performance prohibited any audience members from entering the room as it was not a part of the performance. Curious of what was beyond the restricted area, some entered the restricted area and wandered beyond the set play. The notion of audiences entering restricted areas contributes to interactive immersion because areas off limits contain a sense of mystery and wonder that set designers fail to plan; this impulse to explore arguably led to the birth of interactive and immersive theater. Restricted areas add a layer to the overall experience of an immersive theatre, but can also be dangerous and safety must be considered paramount. Some immersive theater designers incorporate audiences going safely off script into their work. ''Adventure 1,'' conducted by Coney, a British interactive and game-based theater, consists of audiences who record their adventure at St. Paul near the center of London. Participants are in an open and unrestricted set while wearing headphones that plays a fixed narrative. From there, audiences can travel anywhere.  Although the members of the theatre listen to direction, they can encounter various experiences beyond the script or role. This contributes to more experiences that set designers fail to plan in the original experience.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''''Knockout''''' may refer to one of two British comics.

==1939 series==
The first, published by the [[Amalgamated Press]] (later [[Fleetway Publications]]), was launched by editor [[Percy Clarke]] and sub-editor [[Leonard Matthews]] in 1939 to compete with ''[[The Dandy]]'' and ''[[The Beano]]'', launched by [[DC Thomson]] in 1937 and 1938 respectively. Like its rivals, it featured a mixture of humour and adventure strips and illustrated prose stories.

''[[That '70s Show]]'' was released on [[DVD]] in Regions 1, 2 &amp; 4 by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Home Entertainment]] at an increment of two seasons per year.

The complete series was released in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] on October 14, 2008, the Canadian cost being almost double the U.S. price.

The DVDs contain various bonus features, such as the original promos for the episodes that aired on FOX on the original air date, retrospective interviews with various cast members, and commentaries by director [[David Trainer]] on selected episodes.

The first five seasons were released in four slimcases per season with one disc per slimcase, however, beginning with season six, FOX scaled back the sets to two cases with two discs in each. This was also a complaint among collectors. Other complaints of the sets were the reusage of [[Eric Forman]]'s face twice on the spine and then the discontinuation of characters on the spine. Noticeably also, every set contained the season number on the spine except for season seven.

The music that featured many popular bands was predominantly removed or replaced with stock music on the DVD releases, in order to avoid paying royalties to the artists involved (unlike the actual run of a series, where studios would only have to pay royalties to the artist for that single episode, and maybe for syndication). Episodes were also often edited to remove content by cutting out lines that were deemed to be inappropriate.

Despite his brief appearance in the [[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 8)|eighth season]], [[Michael Kelso]]'s picture is still on the front and back cover of the season's DVD. His portrayer [[Ashton Kutcher]]'s name is credited with the cast which reads "and special guest star: Ashton Kutcher".

On May 4, 2011, [[Mill Creek Entertainment]] announced that they had acquired the rights to re-release the series on DVD in Region 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.millcreekent.com/media/pdf/May%202011%20CarseyWerner%20Press%20Release%20-%20FINAL.pdf |title=Mill Creek Entertainment and Carsey-Werner Television Distribution Ink Deal to Release ''That '70s Show'' |publisher=Millcreekent.com |accessdate=2013-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928162526/https://www.millcreekent.com/media/pdf/May%202011%20CarseyWerner%20Press%20Release%20-%20FINAL.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have subsequently re-released all eight seasons on DVD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-Seasons-1-and-2-and-Biggest-Hits/15592 |title=That '70s Show DVD news: Announcement for That '70s Show - Season 1 and That '70s Show - Season 2 and That '70s Show - Biggest Hits |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110030734/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-Seasons-1-and-2-and-Biggest-Hits/15592 |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-Seasons-3-and-4/16575 |title=That '70s Show DVD news: Announcement for Season 3 and Season 4 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110031602/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-Seasons-3-and-4/16575 |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-Seasons-5-and-6/17229 |title=That '70s Show DVD news: Announcement for Season 5 and Season 6 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110030732/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-Seasons-5-and-6/17229 |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-Seasons-7-and-8/17954 |title=That '70s Show DVD news: Announcement for That '70s Show - Season 7 and That '70s Show - Season 8 |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110030732/http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-Seasons-7-and-8/17954 |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2011, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that they were working on a [[Blu-ray Disc]] release of Season 1 and that it would be released on January 10, 2012. However, the date was pushed back to March 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/70s-Season-1-Blu-ray/11745 |title=That '70s Show - Season 1 |publisher=TV Shows on DVD |language=English |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=11 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713122110/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/70s-Season-1-Blu-ray/11745 |archivedate=13 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Season Two [[Blu-ray Disc]] was released on October 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/70s-Season-2-Blu-ray/12562|title=That '70s Show - Season 2|publisher=TV Shows on DVD|language=English|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=11 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713123410/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/70s-Season-2-Blu-ray/12562|archivedate=13 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No further seasons were released due to poor sales.

On May 14, 2013, Mill Creek released ''That '70s Show - The Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-The-Complete-Series/18205 |title=That '70s Show DVD news: Announcement for That '70s Show - The Complete Series |publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522040050/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-The-Complete-Series/18205 |archivedate=2013-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2015, Mill Creek released ''That '70s Show- The Complete Series'' on Blu-ray for the very first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-The-Complete-Series/21441 Official Studio Press Release, Package for 'The Complete Series' Blu-ray!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819140140/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/70s-The-Complete-Series/21441 |date=2015-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mill Creek sets claim to contain the original uncut broadcast edits, with most though not all of the original music intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/dvds-tvs-roseanne----a-wo_b_986438.html |title=Michael Giltz: DVDs: TV's Roseanne - A Working Class Comedy at a Working Class Price! |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, upon closer inspection, it's revealed that they're mostly repeats of the Fox sets with the majority of the music still omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitcomsonline.com/that70sshowseason3millcreekdvdreview.html|title=That '70s Show - Season Three (Mill Creek) DVD Review - Sitcoms Online|website=sitcomsonline.com|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitcomsonline.com/that70sshowseason4millcreekdvdreview.html|title=That '70s Show - Season Four (Mill Creek) DVD Review - Sitcoms Online|website=sitcomsonline.com|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitcomsonline.com/that70sshowseason5millcreekdvdreview.html|title=That '70s Show - Season Five (Mill Creek) DVD Review - Sitcoms Online|website=sitcomsonline.com|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitcomsonline.com/that70sshowseason6millcreekdvdreview.html|title=That '70s Show - Season Six (Mill Creek) DVD Review - Sitcoms Online|website=sitcomsonline.com|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vetala Tales'''''
&lt;ref&gt;({{lang-sa|वेतालपञ्चविंशति}}, [[IAST]]: {{IAST|vetālapañcaviṃśati}} "Vetala's 25 stories"; [[Hindi]]: ''Baital Pachisi'' "Baital's 25 [stories]". Numerous English titles include ''Twenty-five Tales of a Demon'' (and similar titles using instead "Sprite" or "Genie" or "Ghost" or "Goblin") and ''Vikram and the Vampire''. ''Vetala Tales'' is used here as a designation for the collection in general, without reference to a specific version.&lt;/ref&gt; 
is a popular collection of stories from [[India]] of unknown antiquity, but predating the 11th century CE. It exists in four main [[Sanskrit]] recensions, and many modern translations into Indian and other vernaculars. The collection consists of a series of unrelated tales, all told within the context of a [[frame story]].  The exact content of the frame stories varies between versions, but always involves the core element of King [[Vikramaditya]] carrying a dead body to a yogi in a cemetery; the body is possessed by a [[Vetala]], who tells Vikramaditya the tales to pass the time, and aids him in thwarting the yogi's nefarious scheme in the conclusion. Unlike the ''[[Panchatantra]]'', whose recensions and translations sometimes vary greatly (see [[List of Panchatantra Stories|List of ''Panchatantra'' Stories]] for a tabulated comparison), the overall content and structure of the ''Vetala Tales'' has remained relatively stable (though exhibiting many minor differences).

==Frame story==

The elements of the frame story vary significantly between versions, and the logical or narrative connections between them are not always made clear.

===Sanskrit and Hindi frames===

;Transfers of throne and fruit
King Gandharvasena (father of Vikramaditya) dies. His 1st son, Shank, succeeds, but is killed by the 2nd son, Vikramaditya, who succeeds to the throne. However, Vikramaditya goes abroad, consigning the throne to the 3rd son, Bharthari. Then follows the episode of the Fruit of Immortality: the fruit gets passed around, its trail revealing conflicting loyalties; because of this, Bharthari becomes despondent and vacates the throne. Indra sends a demon to guard the city, but Vikramaditya returns to regain the throne and subdues the demon. The demon narrates the story of "Three sons" (below) to Vikramaditya.

This narrative does not occur in any of the Sanskrit recensions. It begins Lāl's Hindi translation, and has a close analogue in the ''Thirty-Two Tales of the Throne of Vikramaditya'' (''[[Simhasana Dvatrimsika|Simhāsana Dvātriṃśikā]]''). Burton includes it in his introduction.

;Three sons
A) A king comes across an ascetic absorbed in supernatural meditation. Out of pique the king decides to disturb the ascetic, and sends a harlot to seduce him. She succeeds and eventually brings the ascetic and his son to the city, at which point the ascetic realizes he has been tricked out of his merit. In anger he kills his child.

B) This leads (it is not explained how) to the birth of 3 children in the same city at the same time with linked destinies: the sons of a king, a potter, and an oil merchant. The potter's son kills the oil merchant's son.

This narrative occurs in Sivadasa and Lāl. Only in Lāl is it made clear that the king's son is Vikramaditya, the potter's son is the yogi (of the subsequent section), and the oil merchant's son is the body inhabited by the Vetala. In his conclusion, Jambhaladatta has the Vetala narrate his own previous history which is somewhat related to part B, but with a very different overall story. Burton has Indra's giant tell part B, then part A which occurs subsequently (the ascetic here being the yogi himself).

;Yogi and Vetala
Every day, a yogi (Kṣāntiśīla in many versions) brings a fruit to Vikramaditya which he passes off to an attendant or minister. One day the fruit is accidentally broken open in the king's presence, revealing a priceless jewel. Investigation reveals that all the fruits likewise contained jewels. Vikramaditya questions the yogi who states that he intends to perform rites in a cremation-ground and asks the king to join him on a certain night. Vikramaditya agrees. When he does so, the yogi asks him to bring him a certain dead body hanging from a tree in another nearby cremation-ground. The body turns out to be inhabited by a vetala, who decides to pass the time on the way back to the yogi by telling tales. 

This narrative occurs in all 4 Sanskrit recensions, as well as most other versions.

;Conclusion
After the Vetala is done telling his tales, he helps Vikramaditya by predicting the yogi's treachery, and explaining a ruse by which he can avoid it. Vikramaditya finally succeeds in bringing the body to the yogi, and just before the end of the rite, tricks and kills the yogi. Vikramaditya then generally receives great power and specific boons (including that this very story achieve great renown).

This narrative occurs in all 4 Sanskrit recensions, as well as most other versions. The power and boons are attributed to different sources in different versions, e.g. a result of the rite itself (Sivadasa), gandharvas (Sivadasa), Indra (Lāl), Shiva (Somadeva), a goddess (Jambhaladatta).

An abbreviated version of "Yogi and Vetala" and the Conclusion is given as the 31st of the ''Thirty-Two Tales of the Throne of Vikramaditya'' (''Simhāsana Dvātriṃśikā'').

===Other frames===
The beginning of the Tamil version mirrors the frame story of the Katha-sarit-sagara, in that the Vetala is actually a Brahmin, cursed for repeating Shiva's tale — the ''Vetala Tales'' in fact — which the Vetala must now repeat until someone (Vikrama) can solve their riddles.&lt;ref&gt;Penzer 1926, pp 231-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetan and Mongolian versions also exist in which not only the frame story, but also the component tales, are quite different.&lt;ref&gt;Penzer 1926, pp 241-246.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neil Hamburger''' is a fictional [[standup comedy|standup comedian]] and singer, created and portrayed by Australian-American entertainer [[Gregg Turkington]], who is characterized by his misanthropic jokes and [[anti-comedy]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Logan |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Neil Hamburger: Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/aug/20/neil-hamburger-edinburgh-review |date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkington has released a number of albums as Hamburger and has appeared as the character in various films, television shows, and other media. In 2015, the act inspired the [[Rick Alverson]] film ''[[Entertainment (2015 film)|Entertainment]]'', which stars Turkington as a "variant" of the Neil Hamburger character.&lt;ref name="NYTinterview"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Ratliff|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/21/movies/for-gregg-turkingtons-character-theres-no-success-like-failure.html |title=For Gregg Turkington’s Character, There’s No Success Like Failure |date=November 21, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]]|language=en |access-date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkington developed the character in the 1990s and originally envisioned the concept as a "weird recording project". It originated from a [[prank call]] that appeared on the album ''[[Great Phone Calls Featuring Neil Hamburger]]'' (1992).

Hamburger's live act, which is quite different from his many albums, features a barrage of question/answer jokes aimed often at celebrity targets as well as barbs aimed at his ex-wife. The confrontational aspects of his act drew comparisons to [[Tony Clifton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hour.ca/stage/stage.aspx?iIDArticle=7305]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208221054/http://www.hour.ca/stage/stage.aspx?iIDArticle=7305 |date=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most famous gags is the "Zipper Lips", in which he asks an audience member a question. If the audience member doesn't respond, Hamburger derides them for being a "zipper lips". A common phrase used by the comedian is "But that's my life!", which he uses when he mentions being humiliated or degraded for some reason.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Career==
{{BLP sources|section|date=October 2018}}
His first full-length album, ''[[America's Funnyman]]'', was released in 1996 on the [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]]. Several more were issued on the record label. 

Hamburger was a frequent guest on the Internet talk show ''[[Tom Green's House Tonight]]'' (2006–2013). In 2006, Hamburger started doing his own show called ''[[Poolside Chats|Poolside Chats with Neil Hamburger]]'' on ''The Channel'' at Tomgreen.com. Guests on his show have included [[Tim and Eric]], [[Kyle Gass]] of [[Tenacious D]], [[Buzz Osborne]] of [[The Melvins]], and [[Bonnie 'Prince' Billy]].

In 2006, Hamburger had a brief [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny]]''. Over the next year, he opened for [[Tenacious D]] during their Pick of Destiny Tour.  However, his performances incited mostly negative reactions, with booing and heckling ensuing in countries such as Ireland and England. His performance at Madison Square Garden was referred to by [[Sia Michel]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as likely "the greatest night of his career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Michel |first1=Sia |title=So Good at Being Lousy: It’s a Joke, See? No, Really |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/04/arts/music/04tena.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Drag City released an album of country and western originals and covers recorded by Hamburger in a "celebrity vocals" style. During the sessions, Hamburger was backed by musicians including [[Prairie Prince]] of [[The Tubes]] and [[Todd Rundgren]]'s band, David Gleason, [[Atom Ellis]] of [[Dieselhed]] and [[the New Cars]], [[Rachel Haden]] from [[That Dog]].

In December 2010, [[Special Entertainment]] released an iPhone App called ''Shaky Advice from Neil Hamburger'' that functions much like a [[Magic 8 Ball]], with 30 video clips of Hamburger giving comical advice.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In 2015, the Neil Hamburger act was dramatized for the [[Rick Alverson]] film ''[[Entertainment (2015 film)|Entertainment]]''. In it, the character is shown repeatedly on and offstage; as well as the life of a fictional portrayal of the man behind the act separate from the real Gregg Turkington. The film's script was written by Turkington, Alverson, and comedian [[Tim Heidecker]], although the dialogue was improvised.&lt;ref name="NYTinterview"/&gt;

Australian radio audiences have had virtually no exposure to [[pirate radio]]. There were no broadcasts as part of the [[World War II]] propaganda campaigns and commercial as well as community stations alongside the taxpayer funded [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] were available during the mid to late 1980s and early 1990s - a period when the UK was experiencing a surge in illegal broadcasts during the early days of [[acid house]] and the [[Second Summer of Love]]. The absence of pirate radio in Australia is primarily attributed to the relatively large number of commercial licences that were issued, particularly after World War 2, as well as the existence of public (later renamed community) non-commercial broadcasting licenses supported mainly by listener subscription.  Additionally, the lack of availability of imported broadcasting equipment and the likely application of severe, legislated penalties including jail for offenders, would also have been a factor.

[[Amateur radio]] operators must obtain a $250 low-power open [[narrowcasting]] license from the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] to legally operate on a specific frequency.&lt;ref name="ppthc"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/pirates-plunder-the-high-cs-20120728-233aj.html |title=Pirates plunder the high Cs |author=David Rood |accessdate=25 April 2015 |date=29 July 2012 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrences==
A small number of the total pirate radio stations in Australia are documented.&lt;ref name="ppthc"/&gt;
* Early to mid-1960s [[Bruce Jackson (audio engineer)|Bruce Jackson]] and friends from [[Vaucluse High School]] were raided by the [[Postmaster-General's Department|PMG]] for operating an AM pirate station that unbeknown to them covered all of Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jands.com.au/company/about_us/company_history/how_did_jands_get_its_name How Did Jands Get Its Name?]. Retrieved 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966 Radio [[Prosh (University of Adelaide)|Prosh]] transmits from a ship in international waters off [[Kangaroo Island]].  [[Ernie Sigley]] plays host.  The [[Postmaster-General's Department|PMG]] jams the signal from the mainland.  A number of protests result but the station is short lived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioheritage.net/Story127.asp South Australia's Pirate Radio PROSH 'Piracy on the Airwaves']. Radio Heritage Foundation. Retrieved 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Early 1970s: University students and draft resisters, protesting against [[conscription in Australia]] and the Vietnam War, set up pirate radio stations broadcasting on the AM band called ''Radio Draft Resistance'' at Sydney and Melbourne Universities for short periods of time.
* December 1986: A series of test broadcasts from a radio station calling itself Radio Uranus was heard in [[Melbourne]] on 98.4&amp;nbsp;MHz. They said that they were preparing for a major broadcast on Christmas Eve. The test broadcasts consisted of two people (possibly the station's founders) playing music and talking in between tracks. The second test broadcast sounded like they were on a boat, as a boat engine could clearly be heard in the background, and they may have even said that they were on a boat or ship.
* 18–19 November 1989: Radio Uranus was heard once again, with another series of test broadcasts, one on each day, heard on 97.7&amp;nbsp;MHz. It was not until 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 19 November, when the test broadcast ended and a proper broadcast began, that the identity of the station was known. The broadcast consisted of the same format of music and talk as in 1986. According to the presenters, they were using a 10&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter located in Kinglake, in the outer east of Melbourne. The transmission even featured a cross to their 'stereo cruiser' located near the city. The broadcast ended suddenly some time after 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. when the presenters interrupted the song being played to say that they were raided.  Mentions of rebroadcasts to Fuji suggest HF may have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;(18 June 2017). [http://www.crossbandradio.com/unsorted/Pirate%20radiouranus%20melbourne.mp3]. Radio Uranus recording on crossbandradio.com. Retrieved 18 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1990s: Two pirates broadcasting on shortwave from Australia were heard worldwide. The stations were called Radio G'day and Tasmania Radio Int.
* 1991: An FM pirate radio station called "Radio Heinz" broadcast from Wangaratta (Northeast Victoria), with a power of 50W for three months. The station played entire music albums with voice announcements in between. It gained rapid popularity as an alternative to the [[3NE]] commercial station and [[3WPR|WPR-FM]] community radio station, until it was forced to shut down.
* 1992: A short range radio broadcaster calling itself Rex FM broadcasts in the [[Ballarat]] central business district at intermittent intervals over the course of a fortnight. The format is music and talk.
* 30 December 1992: A pirate radio station calling itself 3PPP was heard on the FM band in the inner suburbs of Melbourne from before 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. till some time after midnight. The broadcast featured music and talk.
* 2001: Radio Eureka made several broadcasts with power of approximately 12 Watts on frequency 6235&amp;nbsp;kHz.
* 2004: 22 August. Tower Radio 11412&amp;nbsp;kHz also 6270&amp;nbsp;kHz 50 Watts.
* 2006: March–November. 105.7&amp;nbsp;MHz on 25 Watts serving the [[Bendigo]] region.
*2007: At the age of 12, [[Tim Wong See]] operated a pirate radio station called '2FT' from his home in [[West Pennant Hills, New South Wales|West Pennant Hills]] before the ACMA shut it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/radio-pirate-aftrs-student|title=From radio pirate to AFTRS student|last=Info|first=Radio|date=2013-01-10|work=Radio Info|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2008: April–September. 105.7&amp;nbsp;MHz was heard once again in the Bendigo region. The broadcast consisted mainly of dance music with regular hosts, including live from the "Bathroom Nightclub."
* 2011: August–November. 105.7&amp;nbsp;MHz was heard yet again in the Bendigo region, This time on 40 Watts and playing predominately dance music. The station was closed by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] consequently having equipment seized.&lt;ref&gt;(30 September 2013).

* 2011: 25 September-5 October.  A station was heard in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne on 1485&amp;nbsp;kHz on several evenings commencing 25 September.  The station carried a rebroadcast of [[3MP|My MP]], a digital only commercial radio station.  On 5 October, the Australian Communications and Media Authority reported that it shut down an unlicensed AM radio station operating on 1485&amp;nbsp;kHz from [[Chadstone, Victoria|Chadstone]] following a complaint.&lt;ref&gt;(6 August 2013).

*2016: February 29. Dan Morris's West Wollongong home was raided by the ACMA to shut down his pirate station IRIE FM. In January he was interviewed for Vice.com in an article, titled ‘Meet Australia’s Preeminent Jamaican Pirate Radio Broadcaster’.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/an-afternoon-at-australias-preeminent-jamaican-pirate-radio-station&lt;/ref&gt; It proved to be his undoing, after the ACMA saw it and investigated.Magistrate Michael Stoddart fined Morris a total of $3,000 and ordered the transmitter be forfeited.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/4032165/wollongongs-pirate-radio-station-shut-down-dj-fined/&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- PLEASE do not change the spelling of programme to program. Wikipedia policy is to retain the English dialect used in the first version of the article. This prevents needless "spelling wars". Changing the spelling also breaks links and categories.--&gt; 
A '''programme''' or '''program''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#Different spellings, different connotations|spelling differences]]) is a booklet available for patrons attending a live event such as [[theatre]] performances, [[fête]]s, [[sport]]s events, etc. It is a printed leaflet outlining the parts of the event scheduled to take place, principal performers and background information. In the case of theatrical performances, the term '''''playbill''''' is also used. It may be provided free of charge by the event organisers or a charge may be levied.

==Performing arts==
At a [[theatre]], [[opera]], or [[ballet]] performance, they are usually given at the door in the [[United States]], while they are usually sold in the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] programme makes its money from selling advertisements. A programme company pays the theatre for the rights to produce the production’s programmes, which is contrary to common belief that the theatre pays the programme company.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Ken. ''Broadway: Its History, People, and Places: An Encyclopedia''. New York: Routland, 2004. (p 281)&lt;/ref&gt; The programme generally contains photos of the production, a cast list, biographies of the actors and production staff involved, the name of the theatre, background information, and can contain advertisements. For example, the programme for the original production of ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' contained articles by the staff about how the production was created.  The first theatre programmes were issued in the mid-nineteenth century in magazine format.&lt;ref name=coll&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorspost.com/playbills.htm|title=A History of Playbills &amp; Theatre Programs|publisher=|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original theatre programme first appeared in the 18th century. The early playbills were basic, with only enough pages to list the cast members and information on the play's locale and scenes. There were usually only four pages: the cover advertised the show, a back page displayed the theatre layout, and the two interior pages listed all the credits.&lt;ref name="Bordman 2004. p 502"&gt;Bordman, Gerald and Thomas Hischak. ''The Oxford Companion to American Theatre''. New York: Oxford Uni. Press, 2004. (p 502)&lt;/ref&gt; Not all early programmes were printed, but written by hand or cut and pasted together from the letters of other printed documents. The latter was especially done by theatre entrepreneur Sarah Baker, who owned several theatres in Kent, during the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;Russell, Gillian. ''1765 Theatre Playbill: The Earliest Surviving Document Printed In Australia''. http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/stories/2008/2285731.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In early British theatre, the cast was very important. Audiences were very familiar with leading actors and a particular player could draw a larger crowd. The programme was a kind of contract between the theatre and the audience, because if an audience paid to see a particular actor and they were not presented, there was the immediate risk of crowd hissing, orange throwing, or even rioting. This sometimes resulted in property damage and physical assault.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au" /&gt;

Programmes were not only distributed in theatres, but also on the streets. The distributors were often women who worked for the theatre by selling oranges as refreshments to audiences. It has been alluded to that these women were also prostitutes. However, there was still a large rate of illiteracy among theatre goers. This resulted in companies of actors traversing urban streets with a beating drum while announcing upcoming venues.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au" /&gt;
 
By the 19th century, the programmes, similar to today's, were being printed. However, the earlier playbills of the 18th century still contained more designs and information about a production.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Ken. ''Broadway: Its History, People, and Places: An Encyclopedia''. New York: Routland, 2004. (p 279)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1884, advertisements had become a standard feature in playbills. Beginning in [[New York City]], the first company to specialize in printing theatrical programmes was founded by an [[Ohio]] business man, [[Frank Vance Strauss]]. By 1911, the company was called the ''Strauss Magazine Theatre Program''.&lt;ref name="Bordman 2004. p 502"/&gt; On September 23, 1920, the company, then known as the ''New York Theatre Program Corporation'', advertised its sales at a million and a half per month.&lt;ref&gt;"Printer's Ink," no. 112: 45&lt;/ref&gt; This corporation was the early foundation for the modern day magazine, [[Playbill]].&lt;ref&gt;Botto, Louis.'' At This Theatre: 100 Years of Broadway Shows, Stories, and Stars''. New York: Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books, 2002. (p xiii)&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], British theatre programmes underwent a dramatic change as the government placed restrictions over paper use. The programme turned back into a single sheet of paper folded over once to efficiently create four available pages for text. Not until the 1970s were photo printed programmes available and widely distributed at British theatres. The American Playbill did not suffer as severely during the second World War and was still published at a regular rate.&lt;ref name="coll"/&gt;

Theatre programmes have become very valuable articles of information for a city or nation's cultural history. An example is Australia's celebration in 2008 over the returning of its earliest surviving document from Canada, which was a theatre playbill from 1796. The playbill advertised the production of ''The Tragedy of Jane Shore''. George Hughes, a convict aboard the [[First Fleet]], printed the playbill using Australia’s first printing press.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

In September 2017, the [[British Library]] opened its "In the Spotlight" project, showcasing a portion of its significant collection of playbills dating from the 1730s to the 1950s. Some of the library's collection of approximately 234,000 playbills, bound into over 1000 volumes, were digitised and made accessible online. The public were asked, via the project website, to help "bring them back into the spotlight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.libcrowds.com/collection/playbills/about/|title=In the Spotlight|website=LibCrowds|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[professional sports|professional]] [[sporting events]], programmes are often sold, and contain information about the teams competing. In the United Kingdom, football programmes are issued by the home team for every home match and, as a hobby, are collected by supporters and football enthusiasts. [[Sport]]s programmes can be highly collectible, with some rare [[Football (soccer)|football]] programmes commanding high prices: in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], potentially into the thousands of [[Pound sterling|pounds]].{{Citation needed|reason=While likely to be true, a source is needed for such a claim|date=October 2018}} Oftentimes in European sports, independent companies will publish their own programmes and sell them outside a venue. These are known as [[fanzines]]. Although it is less common in the United States, outside of [[Fenway Park]], this is a common occurrence as ''Yawkey Way Report'' is sold as well as another booklet.

==Film==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
In the case of [[film]]s, programmes are rarely provided, although they were frequently given out during the original [[roadshow]] engagements of spectaculars such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'' (1961), or ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), as well as "specialized" films like Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' or the three [[Laurence Olivier]] Shakespeare films that he starred in and directed: ''Henry V'', ''Hamlet'', and ''Richard III''.  They served much the same function as those for live theater. Programmes for films made in special widescreen processes also explained how the widescreen effect was accomplished.

'''''Riot''''' is a 2017 [[Indie game|indie video game]] about a riot simulator based on real events. The project started with an Indiegogo campaign in February 2014, which ended in a success. The developers went silent until 2014, whereupon the goal of the "second half of 2014" was predicted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riotgame.org/blog/?p=533&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on December 6, 2017 for [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s early access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIOT - Civil Unrest on Steam|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/342310/RIOT__Civil_Unrest/|website=store.steampowered.com|accessdate=6 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the game and previously an editor and cinematographer at Valve, Leonard Menchiari, has experienced riots personally and the game "Riot" was created as a way to express it and to tell the stories of these events. The player can pick between playing as police or rioters.&lt;ref name=riotgame&gt;http://www.riotgame.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The game will potentially be released on [[Mac OS X|Mac]], [[Linux]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The producers are interested in bringing the game to these platforms, but are currently restricted by their budget.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riotgame.org/FAQ/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{copypaste|paragraph|url=http://www.riotgame.org/blog/?p=17#more-17|date=August 2016}}
RIOT allows the player to play as both the police and rioting groups. As the police, the game revolves around strategy and planning, with a GUI that adopts a traditional police style. This contrasts the typical gameplay of the rioting group, which is adaptive and responsive, relying on the decisions the police make as opposed to long-term planning, instead relying on fast decision making skills.&lt;ref name="update1"&gt;http://www.riotgame.org/blog/?p=17#more-17&lt;/ref&gt; The game includes six main campaigns set in [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Spain]] and [[Egypt]].

Other riots set across the world will be available as well as an unlockable.&lt;ref name=riotgame /&gt; Each scenario will have different backgrounds as well as props and police uniforms. activists’ clothing will be procedurally generated.&lt;ref name=riotgame /&gt; Characters will have different stats that change the way they react in different situations, This means people will act in unpredictable ways based on the elements that will happen in each riot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.riotgame.org/blog/?p=470#more-470&lt;/ref&gt; RIOT is planning to release an in-game level editor, using this players will be able to re-create the riots that are currently going on in the world.&lt;ref name=update1 /&gt; The levels can then be shared with anyone in the world, and can then be rated by others based on quality and historical accuracy.&lt;ref name=riotgame /&gt;

==Development==

The scenarios in ''Riot'' were partly informed through designer Leonard Menchiari's participation in the Italian [[Turin–Lyon_high-speed_railway#No_TAV_movement|No TAV]] protests.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web| url=https://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/22/video-game-inspired-by-clashes-in-egypt-and-italy-allows-gamers-to-fight-the-police/| title=The Lede: Video Game Inspired by Clashes in Egypt and Italy Allows Gamers to Fight the Police| author=Colin Moynihan| work=[[New York Times]]| date=2013-02-22| accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GS&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-worlds-riots-inspired-a-video-game/1100-6405315/| title=How the World's Riots Inspired a Video Game| author=Gamespot staff| work=[[GameSpot]]| date=2013-03-19| accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Riot'' was part funded through an [[Indiegogo]] crowdfunding campaign, raising $36,139 in March 2013.&lt;ref name=IG&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/riot--4#/| title=RIOT| author=Leonard Menchiari| publisher=[[Indiegogo]]| accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the game's budget was for travel and research.  Designer Mattia Traverso, who joined Menchiari at the time of the Indiegogo campaign said, "Physically visiting these places and joining the live riots is fundamental", "how could we even claim to describe such an important topic without having lived it multiple times or having talked with the rioters or the police?"&lt;ref name=Joystiq&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/03/08/riot-in-the-streets-at-a-desk-in-your-hand-an-indie-documenta/| title=Riot in the streets, at a desk, in your hand: An indie documentary game| author=Jessica Conditt| work=[[Joystiq]]| date=2013-03-08| accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game aims to depict scenarios in a neutral manner, allowing the player to explore both sides of the conflict.&lt;ref name=Zam&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.zam.com/article/1300/exploring-real-life-protests-in-riot-civil-unrest| title=Exploring real-life protests in Riot: Civil Unrest| author=Kris Ligman| work=[[ZAM.com]]| date=2017-01-19| accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Riot'' emulates a 2D retro look even though the scene is 3D, which gives more realistic lighting, physics, and visual effects. All character movements are physics based. This means that rather than following just a path, the crowd movement will be influenced by the physical contact given by the rest of the crowd.&lt;ref name=riotgame /&gt;  The art style is inspired by ''[[Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

The '''Seoul Lantern Festival''' is an annual festival held every November in [[Seoul]] in [[South Korea]] when hundreds of lanterns decorate the public recreation space of [[Cheonggyecheon]].

==Introduction==
The Seoul Lantern Festival started in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seoul Lantern Festival has started|url=http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/651427|publisher=No Cut News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-week festival starts on the Friday of the first week in November and covers downtown Seoul in sparkling lights, illuminating the city at night during the early winter. Visitors can encounter various types of lanterns from [[Cheonggye Plaza]] to [[Supyo Bridge]] (1.2 kilometers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seoul Lantern Festival 2015|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/kr/article/article.do?_method=view&amp;art_id=58485&amp;lang=kr&amp;m=0004021001001&amp;p=21|publisher=The Official Seoul City Tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program ==
Seoul Lantern Festival offers different concepts of festival every year.

=== 2009 ===
[[File:Lotus Lantern Seoul Lantern Festival.jpg|thumb|Seoul Lantern Festival – Lotus lantern – 2009]]
The first Seoul Lantern Festival celebrated the 'Visit Korea Year 2010 to 2012' for 5 days. The festival had four themes that were related to 'ryu' Korean.  
* Theme 1: Gyoryu zone (Exchange zone)

The Seoul Lantern Festival changed its Korean name in 2014 to the Seoul Bitcholong Festival, but there was no change to the name in English. According to the organizing committee, it has changed the Korean name because the festival has expanded to be a combination of traditional lanterns and modern lights like LEDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.tf.co.kr/read/life/1443769.htm|title = What is Seoul Lantern Festival?|last = Seo|first = Minji|date = 2014-11-07|work = |access-date = |via = |publisher = The Fact}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has opened from Cheonggye Plaza to Supyogyo(Bridge) about 1.2&amp;nbsp;km and displayed about 30,000 light bulbs and about 300 lanterns of 58 lantern light arts.

== Criticism ==
The Seoul Lantern Festival was organized just in time to celebrate the 'Visit Korea Year 2010 to 2012'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=003&amp;aid=0002955990|title = Crowded at the Seoul Lantern Festival|last = Cho|first = Soojung|date = 2009-11-14|work = |access-date = |via = |publisher = Newsis}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided to hold the Seoul Lantern Festival annually, and in response the city of [[Jinju]] criticized the festival severely. They said that the Seoul Lantern Festival was a copy of their Jinju Namgang Yudeng Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://mbn.mk.co.kr/pages/news/newsView.php?category=mbn00009&amp;news_seq_no=1528614|title = Seoul Lantern Festival has opened, the strong blacklash from city Jinju|last = Lee|first = Donghoon|date = 2013-11-01|work = |access-date = |via = |publisher = MBN}}&lt;/ref&gt; which itself is annual and had begun earlier, in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.knnews.co.kr/news/articleView.php?idxno=1086972|title = Jinju Namgang Yudeng Festival and Seoul Lantern Festival|last = Lee|first = Woongho|date = 2013-09-25|work = |access-date = |via = |publisher = knnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been started in that year as a public requiem, and also as an occasion for a Korean prayer rite in honour of about 70,000 soldiers and civilians who had died in the [[Siege of Jinju (1593)|historic second battle]] at Jinju Castle in 1593.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.yudeung.com/intro/?fd=intro01|title = Jinju Namgang Yudeng Festival Webpage|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 20 Jinju associations asked for the Seoul Lantern Festival to be discontinued.

'''Lester Alvin Burnett'''&lt;!-- NOTE: "Burnett" with no final "e" is correct as birth name --&gt; (March 18, 1911&amp;nbsp;– February 16, 1967), better known as '''Smiley Burnette''', was an American [[country music]] performer and a comedic actor in [[Western film]]s and on radio and TV, playing [[sidekick]] to [[Gene Autry]], [[Roy Rogers]], and other [[B movies (Hollywood Golden Age)#Cowboys and dogsmovie|B-movie]] cowboys.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was also a prolific singer-songwriter who could play as many as 100 musical instruments{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}, some simultaneously. His career, beginning in 1934, spanned four decades, including a regular role on CBS-TV's ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' in the 1960s.

==Biography==

Lester A. Burnett (he added the final "e" later in life)&lt;ref name="Burnette, Elizabeth"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.smileyburnette.org/Smiley/index.html | title = Smiley Burnette&amp;nbsp;– Cowboy Comic | publisher = Smiley Burnette Interprises | author = Burnette, Elizabeth | date = | accessdate = 2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Summum, Illinois]], on March 18, 1911, and grew up in [[Ravenwood, Missouri]]. He began singing as a child and learned to play a wide variety of instruments by ear, yet never learned to read or write music. In his teens, he worked in [[vaudeville]], and starting in 1929, at the state's first commercial radio station, [[WDZ (AM)|WDZ-AM]] in [[Tuscola, Illinois]].

Burnette came by his nickname while creating a character for a WDZ children's program. He was reading [[Mark Twain]]'s "[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]" at the time, which included a character named Jim Smiley. He named the radio character Mr. Smiley and soon adopted the moniker as his own, dropping the title.&lt;ref name="Burnette, Elizabeth"/&gt;

===Film career===

His break came in December 1933, when he was hired by Gene Autry to play accordion on ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' on Chicago's [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]], on which Autry was the major star. As [[sound film]]s became popular, Hollywood sought musical talent for Western films; and in 1934, producer [[Nat Levine]] cast Autry and Burnette in their film debut (unbilled) as part of a [[bluegrass band]] in [[Mascot Pictures]]' ''[[In Old Santa Fe]]'' starring [[Ken Maynard]]. Burnette sang and played accordion, and the film included two of his compositions.[[Image:Gene Autry and Smiley Burnette singing in In Old Santa Fe film, 1934.png|thumb|left|200px|Burnette (r) with Gene Autry in ''In Old Santa Fe'' (1934)]]

He had other small parts until a secondary, but more prominent role in the 1935 [[Serial (film)|serial]] ''[[The Adventures of Rex and Rinty]]''. That same year, Levine gave Autry his first starring role in the 12-part serial ''[[The Phantom Empire]]'', with Burnette playing Oscar, a comic-relief role. Mascot was soon absorbed by [[Republic Pictures]], and Republic enjoyed enormous success with its musical Western features starring Autry. In each of the films, Burnette played Autry's comic sidekick, Frog Millhouse, with his trademark floppy black hat and trick voice (imitating a deep, froglike croak). Their association produced 62 feature-length musical Westerns.

By 1940, Smiley Burnette ranked second only to Autry in a ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]]'' magazine popularity poll of Western stars, the lone sidekick among the top 10 (though offscreen he earned a reputation as being moody and temperamental),&lt;ref name="Smiley Burnette"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allmovie.com/artist/9676  | title = Smiley Burnette | publisher = All Movie.com | author = | date = | accessdate = 2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when Autry left for [[World War II]] service, Burnette provided a sidekick to [[Eddie Dew]], [[Sunset Carson]], and [[Robert Livingston (actor)|Bob Livingston]] and appeared in nine other films with Roy Rogers. Burnette's movie horse, white with a black-ringed left eye, also became famous, first as Black-eyed Nellie, then as Ring-eyed Nellie, and finally as just Ring Eye.&lt;ref name="Burnette, Elizabeth"/&gt;

After leaving Republic in June 1944, he became the sidekick to [[Charles Starrett]] at [[Columbia Pictures]] in the new ''Durango Kid'' series. Starrett and Burnette were paired in 56 films, from 1945 to 1952. When Starrett retired, Burnette was still under contract, so Columbia teamed him with [[Jock Mahoney]] for a new series of Westerns. A pilot film with Mahoney and Burnette was completed, but never released; Columbia then reassigned Burnette to its Gene Autry series, reuniting Burnette with his former partner.

===Singer-songwriter===

Smiley Burnette wrote more than 400 songs and sang a significant number of them on screen. His Western classic, "Ridin' Down the Canyon (To Watch the Sun Go Down)", was later recorded by [[Willie Nelson]], [[Riders in the Sky (band)|Riders in the Sky]], and Johnnie Lee Wills. Other compositions included "On the Strings of My Lonesome Guitar" ([[Jimmy Wakely]]'s theme song in the 1940s), "Fetch Me Down My Trusty .45", "Ridin' All Day", and "It's Indian Summer" as well as "The Wind Sings a Cowboy Song," "The Old Covered Wagon," and "Western Lullaby." He also composed musical scores for such films as ''[[The Painted Stallion]]'' and ''Waterfront Lady''. His songs were recorded by a wide range of singers, including [[Bing Crosby]], [[Ferlin Husky]], and [[Leon Russell]]. His performance of "Steamboat Bill" appeared on ''Billboard's'' country chart in 1939.

===Inventor===

Burnette devised and built some of his unusual musical instruments in his home workshop. His "Jassackaphone", for example, which he played in the film ''The Singing Cowboy'', resembled an [[organ (instrument)|organ]] with pipes, levers, and pull mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Burnette, Elizabeth"/&gt;

In the 1940s, he invented and patented an early home audiovisual system called Cinevision Talkies. Each package contained a [[Gramophone record#Record albums|78 rpm record]] with four of his songs and 15 [[135 film|35 mm]] [[Reversal film|slides]]. The slides were to be projected in order and advanced each time a short tone played on the record during the songs. An inside cover of the record album was white so those with no projector and screen could simply shine a flashlight through the slides and view them on the cover. He also devised more than a dozen clever uses for a common wire [[clothes hanger]] and demonstrated several of them during a TV show guest appearance.&lt;ref name="Burnette, Elizabeth"/&gt;

===Publicity and promotion===

Hollywood stars usually left their publicity and promotion to the studios that employed them, but Smiley Burnette took charge of his promotion personally. He was highly aware of his box-office value and shrewdly merchandised his name and likeness. He organized a national Smiley Burnette Fan Club, aimed mostly at the juvenile audience, and sold autographed photos and souvenirs to club members. He made additional money by making personal appearances at theaters showing his films. Burnette's base of operations was [[Springfield, Missouri]], where he produced and hosted a nationally syndicated 15-minute radio program, ''The Smiley Burnette Show'', through [[Ralph D. Foster|RadiOzark Enterprises]]. He also made regular appearances on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' from Springfield. 

[[File:Petticoat Junction.jpg|thumb|right|200px|&lt;center&gt;Burnette (Far right in back row) and cast of&lt;br&gt;''[[Petticoat Junction]]'']] Gene Autry retired from motion pictures in 1953, and other cowboy stars had either left the movies or were winding down their screen careers. With the studios no longer interested in making B Westerns, Burnette turned to broadcasting and made guest appearances on many [[country music]] radio and TV shows, including ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', and ''[[Town Hall Party|Ranch Party]]''. 

In early 1957, when quiz shows were popular, he filmed a pilot for a proposed ABC-TV series to originate from Springfield called ''Pig 'N Poke,'' a quiz show with a country theme, although ABC did not buy the show.&lt;ref&gt;Billings, Jim "Comes Long Way from Dwarf Role" (January 20, 1957), ''Springfield News &amp; Leader'', p. D2&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnette enjoyed cooking, and in the 1950s, he opened a restaurant chain called The Checkered Shirt, the first of the [[A-frame]] drive-ins.&lt;ref name="Burnette, Elizabeth"/&gt; The first location was in [[Orlando, Florida]], and two locations still exist in California ([[Redding, California|Redding]] and [[Escondido, California|Escondido]]), though they are no longer owned by the Burnette family.

As the 1960s began, Burnette continued to make personal appearances at drive-ins, fairs, hospitals, town squares, and rodeos. Among other venues, he once appeared with Dewey Brown and the Oklahoma Playboys at a Friday-night dance at Jump's Roller Rink in [[Fairfax, Oklahoma]].

In the mid 1960s, he portrayed [[railroad|railway]] engineer Charley Pratt on the [[CBS|CBS-TV]] programs ''Petticoat Junction'' (106 episodes) and ''[[Green Acres]]'' (seven episodes).

'''Structural pluralism''' is "the potential for political competition in communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 1446508 | pmid=11189808 | volume=91 | issue=1 | title=Structural pluralism and all-cause mortality | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=136–8 | last1 = Young | first1 = FW | last2 = Lyson | first2 = TA | doi = 10.2105/ajph.91.1.136 | year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree of structural pluralism is used to examine how societies are structured, and specifically is a way to explain coverage differences in media markets.  Structural pluralism is studied in philosophical, sociological and communication literature.

Structural pluralism is what makes [[civic community]] a unique form of [[civil society]] (Morton, 2000). Structural pluralism represents the extent to which the community has an open and inclusive structure that permits minority voices and opinions to be heard when citizens and citizen groups are addressing community problems (Young, 1999).

Communities are discussed in terms of having common institutions, such as governing or other political bodies, religious, educational and economic institutions.  These bodies or institutions help to maintain the [[social order]] within the community.

This concept comes from the field of [[sociology]], but prior to that, stems from writings by [[Hegel]] (1821) on civic society.  This comes also from the functionalist writings of [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Herbert Spencer]] (Hindman, 1999).

Durkheim writes that there are two organizating principle types of societies, that most like the premodern communities, called [[mechanical solidarity]] in which ethnic and extended families were central; and that called [[organic solidarity]] which examines the relationships of interdependence based on other components, such as work, and social organizations (Durkheim, 1933).  These are equated to today's rural and urban societies respectively.

== In journalism ==

Olien, Donohue and Tichenor (1978; Tichenor, Olien, &amp; Donohue, 1980) helped to fold this concept into the [[communication]] discipline when they noted that structural pluralism has an effect on the way in which news is presented.  Through several studies and publications, they built a model of structural pluralism, and later showed how power relationships work through a systems approach (Donohue, Olien, &amp; Tichenor, 1985; Tichenor, Olien, &amp; Donohue, 1980).

As media are typically supportive of the social system and institutions, as well as dependent upon them for gaining access to and gathering material that will be useful to the public, they often reflect the power structure of the community.  Movements, groups or discussions that are critical of the social structure are often excluded from newspapers in communities where there is a strongly centralized power structure.  An example of such a community would be a town in which a significant portion of adults are employed by one business or industry.  Criticism of this business or industry may erode the faith of community members in it and lead to social unrest.

Initially the work of the Olien, Tichenor and Donohue camp allowed us to see how diversity in communities is reflected in the reporting style of news organizations.  Conflict within communities is more often reported in larger and less homogeneous areas.

However, prior to the Olien, Tichenor, Donohue writings came those of Breed (1958) and Paletz, Reichert and McIntyre (1971). In their original pieces, the lack of criticism by the press on central powerholders was discussed.

Other studies of the impact of structural pluralism on [[journalism]] have looked shown that women are more often represented in areas that are more ethnically diverse (Armstrong, 2002); that newspapers in more diverse communities will be less likely to ignore protest stories or report them in an abbreviated fashion (Stein, et al., 2003); and others.

Structural pluralism has been discussed in law journals as a paradigmatic shift regarding the privatization of government entities (Roberts, 2001).

'''''The Palindromist''''' is a magazine devoted to [[palindrome]]s, published biennially since 1996.  It is edited by [[Mark Saltveit]], a [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]-based stand-up comedian who won the first-ever World Palindrome Championship.&lt;ref name="steinmetz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="harvard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="matheson2" /&gt;

Each issue of the magazine prints a variety of palindromes in various forms (letter-unit, word-unit, and vertical), covers palindrome-related news, and seeks to accredit writers of famous palindromes.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kickshaws" /&gt;  The magazine also covers closely related forms of [[wordplay]], including [[calculator word]]s and written [[charades]].&lt;ref name="kickshaws" /&gt;

The magazine organizes the '''SymmyS Awards''', an annual palindrome competition adjudicated by a celebrity panel.  Past judges have included [[Will Shortz]], [[MC Paul Barman]], [[Ben Zimmer]], [[David Allen Cress]], [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], [[Demetri Martin]], and [[John Flansburgh]].&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="matheson1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="steinmetz" /&gt;

==History==
Throwball was introduced by Jagat Singh Chauhan (1937-2012) who was an alumnus of YMCA College of Physical Education of Madras (now Chennai) and at the same year he organised the first national championships in Jind, Haryana with great contribution of Mrs Shashi Prabha. Mr Jagat Singh Chauhan  was founder/father of handball, netball and Throwball in India. His efforts in Germany during the 1972 Munich Olympics helped make these games a legacy in India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2615">In [[literature]], the '''tritagonist''' or '''tertiary main character''' (from {{lang-grc|τριταγωνιστής}}, ''tritagōnistḗs'', third actor) is the third most important [[Character (arts)|character]] of a narrative, after the [[protagonist]] and [[deuteragonist]]. In [[ancient Greek drama]], the tritagonist was the third member of the acting troupe.

As a character, a tritagonist may act as the instigator or cause of the sufferings of the protagonist.  Despite being the least sympathetic character of the drama, he or she occasions the situations by which pity and sympathy for the protagonist are excited.&lt;ref name="muller"&gt;[[Karl Otfried Müller|Müller, Karl Otfried]], and [[John William Donaldson]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/historyofliterat01mluoft A History of the Literature of Ancient Greece]'', 1858&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|451}}

==History==
The part of the tritagonist emerged from earlier forms of two-actor drama.  Where two actors only allowed for a principal character and their adversary, moving the part of adversary to a third actor (the tritagonist) allowed for the second actor (the deuteragonist) to play roles as a confidant or aide to the principal character, and thereby elicit greater character depth from the principal character by having the protagonist explain their feelings and motivations to an on-stage listener.&lt;ref name="muller" /&gt;{{rp|451}}  As Ancient Greek theater recitations were partly melodic, the role of the tritagonist would typically go to a performer with a voice in the [[bass (voice type)|bass]] range (as compared to the protagonist as tenor and the deuteragonist as baritone).&lt;ref name="mantzius"&gt;''A History of Theatrical Art'', Mantzius (1903).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|172}} [[Cicero]], in his ''[[Divinatio in Caecilium]]'', reported that the tritagonist (being a role of lesser importance than the protagonist) would often have to subdue his voice if he was naturally stronger than the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;''Divinatio in Caecilium'', [[Cicero]], s. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Ancient Greek actors who worked in this role include the orator [[Aeschines]], who was held by [[Demosthenes]] to have been untalented as a tritagonist,&lt;ref name="mantzius" /&gt;{{rp|175}} and Myniscus, who was tritagonist under the playwright [[Aeschylus]].&lt;ref name="mantzius" /&gt;{{rp|195}}

In some forms of Greek theater, it was traditional for the tritagonist to enter the stage from the left.&lt;ref name="muller" /&gt;{{rp|404}}

In [[literature]], '''writing style''' is the manner of expressing thought in language characteristic of an individual, period, school, or nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Webster|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, style is a term that may refer, at one and the same time, to both conventions that go beyond the individual writer and to singular aspects of individual writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Aquilina|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the essential elements of [[spelling]],  [[grammar]], and [[punctuation]], writing style is the choice of [[word]]s, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] structure, and [[paragraph]] structure, used to convey the meaning effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The former are referred to as ''rules'', ''elements'', ''essentials'', ''mechanics'', or ''handbook''; the latter are referred to as ''style'', or ''rhetoric''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=100,129,156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rules are about ''what'' a writer does; style is about ''how'' the writer does it.  While following the rules drawn from established English usage, a writer has great flexibility in how to express a concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The point of good writing style is to
* express the message to the reader simply, clearly, and convincingly;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ross-Larson|1991|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|pp=85,99,112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=69,79,81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* keep the reader attentive, engaged, and interested;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ross-Larson|1991|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|pp=21,26,112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
not to
* display the writer’s personality;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* demonstrate the writer’s skills, knowledge, or abilities;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sebranek et al.|2006|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
although these are usually evident and are what experts consider the writer’s individual style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ross-Larson|1999|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=66,68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of words ==
[[Diction]], or the choice of ''words'', is obviously a central element in every writer’s style.  Although good diction is partly a matter of trial and error, of tinkering with sentences until they sound right, it is also a matter of following certain general preferences that careful readers and writers tend to share.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods for using diction effectively in writing:

== Choice of sentence structure ==
Sooner or later, a writer will have the essential elements of formal ''sentence'' correctness under control and will want to find the best ways of making sentences convey meaning effectively:  how to phrase statements definitely, place coordinate thoughts in coordinate structures, [[Dependent clause|subordinate]] to sharpen the relation between main assertions and modifying elements, eliminate unnecessary words, vary sentence structure, maintain consistency of [[Tone (literature)|tone]], and smooth the general flow of words.  Seemingly minor improvements—the moving of a [[clause]] from one position to another, a shift from the [[Passive voice|passive]] to the [[active voice]], even a slight change in rhythm—can make the difference between drab sentences and pointed ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods for writing effective sentences:
* Avoid irrelevancy&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make real assertions&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rely on the active voice&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Coordinate to show that ideas belong together&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=131–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=110–111,116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Repeat words, phrases, and clauses for emphasis&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make series consistent and climactic&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate to show which is the main statement&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate to avoid monotony&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate to break up lengthy compound sentences&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choose an appropriate means of subordination&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Place subordinate elements where they will convey the exact meaning&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subordinate in one direction per sentence&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be concise but do not omit necessary words&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=126–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=222–223,226,228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Break the monopoly of declarative sentences&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vary the order and complexity of sentence elements&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=157–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vary the length of the sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be consistent&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=146–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avoid distracting repetitions of sound&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Listen for sentence rhythm&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=149–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|pp=150–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use parallel construction&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=121–124,155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keep related words together&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of paragraph structure ==
The most important unit of meaning in every literary work is the ''paragraph''.  Although each sentence conveys a thought, a literary work is not just a sequence of, say, eighty thoughts; it is rather a development of one central [[Thesis statement|thesis]] through certain steps.  Those steps are paragraphs.  Within an effective paragraph the sentences support and extend one another in various ways, making a single, usually complex, unfolding idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from outright incoherence, choppiness, or long-windedness, perhaps the most common flaw in paragraph construction is rigidity of presentation.  Having something to say, the writer merely says it—and goes on to do just the same in the following paragraph.  As a result, the reader feels, not like a participant in the writer’s thought, but like someone receiving instructions or being shown a rapid succession of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some methods for writing effective paragraphs:
* Pursue one main idea&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Place the main idea emphatically&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=78–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Choose a suitable pattern of development&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=161–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=15,70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Link sentences within each paragraph&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=175–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=99–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Link each paragraph to the next&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=99–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vary the length of the paragraphs&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Move between generality and detail&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keep things moving&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Write in paragraph blocks&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make the first paragraph count&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=185–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* End with a strong paragraph&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|pp=193–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Note how rewriting the familiar sentence, "[[The American Crisis|These are the times that try men’s souls.]]" by [[Thomas Paine]], changes the overall impact of the message.

:Times like these try men’s souls.
:How trying it is to live in these times!
:These are trying times for men’s souls.
:Soulwise, these are trying times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Strunk|White|1979|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compare the following passages, and note how the authors convey their messages in different manners, as a result of their choices.

''[[Hamlet]]'', Act II, Scene 2 (1599–1602) by [[William Shakespeare]]:

&lt;!-- This passage is reproduced verbatim from the play.  Please do not correct. --&gt;
:HAMLET.  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.  I have of late—but wherefore I know not—lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging firmament, this  majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.  What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how expressed and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals!  And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|pp=1923–1924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1859) by [[Charles Dickens]]:

:It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dickens|2000|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Child's Christmas in Wales#Publishing history|Memories of Christmas]]'' (1945) by [[Dylan Thomas]]:

:One Christmas was so much like another, in those years, around the sea-town corner now, and out of all sound except the distant speaking of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the afternoon, on the best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and we threw a snowball at her niece, and my hands burned so, with the heat and the cold, when I held them in front of the fire, that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eastman et al.|1977|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Ray Bradbury short fiction bibliography#1955|The Strawberry Window]]" (1955) by [[Ray Bradbury]]:

:In his dream he was shutting the front door with its strawberry windows and lemon windows and windows like white clouds and windows like clear water in a country stream.  Two dozen panes squared round the one big pane, colored of fruit wines and gelatins and cool water ices.  He remembered his father holding him up as a child.  "Look!"  And through the green glass the world was emerald, moss, and summer mint.  "Look!"  The lilac pane made livid grapes of all the passers-by.  And at last the strawberry glass perpetually bathed the town in roseate warmth, carpeted the world in pink sunrise, and made the cut lawn seem imported from some Persian rug bazaar.  The strawberry window, best of all, cured people of their paleness, warmed the cold rain, and set the blowing, shifting February snows afire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bradbury|1971|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]'' (1963) by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]:

:Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states.  I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham.  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.  We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.  Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.  Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial "outside agitator" idea.  Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eastman et al.|1977|p=810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writer's voice ==&lt;!-- Writer's voice links here. --&gt;
{{Distinguish|Character's voice|Grammatical voice}}

The '''writer's voice''' is a rather vague metaphorical term by which some critics refer to distinctive features of a written work in terms of spoken utterance.  The voice of a literary work is then the specific group of characteristics displayed by the narrator or poetic "speaker" (or, in some uses, the actual author behind them), assessed in terms of ''tone'', ''style'', or ''personality''.  Distinctions between various kinds of narrative voice tend to be distinctions between kinds of ''[[Narrative#Types of narrators and their modes|narrator]]'' in terms of how they address the reader (rather than in terms of their perception of events, as in the distinct concept of ''[[Point of view (literature)|point of view]]'').  Likewise in non-narrative poems, distinctions can be made between the personal voice of a private lyric and the assumed voice (the [[Persona#In literature|persona]]) of a dramatic monologue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An author uses sentence patterns not only to make a point or tell a story, but to do it in a certain manner that amounts to a personal signature, a characteristic way of presenting reality.  It is perfectly understandable that an aspiring writer could fall in love with the work of a brilliant literary figure (for example, [[William Faulkner]] or [[William S. Burroughs]]) and then try to emulate that literary voice, but when an amateur aims deliberately for the sort of mature voice found in seasoned professionals, the result is likely to be literarily pretentious and largely unreadable.  In fact, this sort of literary pretentiousness is a clear mark of an amateur.  A strong, distinctive, authoritative writing voice is something most fiction writers want and is something any writer can bring out in himself or herself, but oddly enough, it can’t be produced by concentrating on it, nor can it be imparted by an editor or teacher.  Such an effect is achieved simply by writing often and carefully.  Spending creative energy in the service of the way sentences read as prose is likely to be at the expense of the characters or story.  Writers should concentrate on characters and story and let their voice take care of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Browne|King|1993|pp=175–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing coaches, teachers, and authors of [[creative writing]] books often speak of the writer's voice as distinguished from other [[literary element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=198–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rozelle|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as voice is often described vaguely, their distinction may be only superficial.  In some instances, voice is defined nearly the same as style;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rozelle|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in others, as [[Literary genre|genre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[literary mode]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|pp=24,26,100,116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|pp=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; point of view,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gardner|1991|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mood (literature)|mood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pianka|1998|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; or tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pianka|1998|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
