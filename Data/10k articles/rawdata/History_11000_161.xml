The '''Arab–Israeli conflict''' refers to the political tension, military conflicts and disputes between a number of [[Arab world|Arab countries]] and [[Israel]]. The roots of the Arab–Israeli conflict are attributed to the rise of [[Zionism]] and [[Arab nationalism]] towards the end of the 19th century. Part of the dispute arises from the conflicting claims to the land. Territory regarded by the [[Jewish people]] as their [[Homeland for the Jewish people|ancestral homeland]] is at the same time regarded by the [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arab]] movement as historically and currently belonging to the [[Palestinians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/The+Palestinian+National+Charter.htm |title=The Palestinian National Charter – Article 6 |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Pan-Islamism|Pan-Islamic]] context, as [[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam (House of Islam)|Muslim lands]].

The [[Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine|sectarian conflict]] between Palestinian Jews and Arabs emerged in the early 20th century, peaking into a full-scale [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]] in 1947 and transforming into the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|First Arab–Israeli War]] in May 1948, following the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]]. Large-scale hostilities mostly ended with the cease-fire agreements after the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]. Peace agreements were signed between Israel and Egypt in 1979, resulting in Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula and abolishment of the [[Israeli Military Governorate|military governance system]] in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in favor of [[Israeli Civil Administration]] and consequent unilateral annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem.

The nature of the conflict has shifted over the years from the large-scale, regional Arab–Israeli conflict to a more local [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], which peaked during the [[1982 Lebanon War]]. With the decline of the [[First Palestinian Intifada]], the interim [[Oslo Accords]] led to the creation of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] in 1994, within the context of the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]]. The same year Israel and Jordan reached a peace accord. A cease-fire has been largely maintained between Israel and Baathist Syria, as well as with Lebanon since 2006. Despite the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan, interim peace accords with the Palestinian Authority and the generally existing cease-fire, the Arab League and Israel remain at odds with each other over many issues.

Developments in the course of the Syrian Civil War reshuffled the situation near Israel's northern border, putting the [[Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Hezbollah]] and the [[Syrian opposition]] at odds with each other and complicating their relations with Israel. The conflict between Israel and [[Hamas]]-ruled [[Gaza City|Gaza]], which resulted in the 2014 cease-fire, is usually also considered part of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Its 2006–2012 phase is, however, also attributed to the [[Iran–Israel proxy conflict]] in the region ([[Syria]] and [[Hezbollah]] are being supported by Iran). Since 2012, Iran (predominantly [[Shia Islam|Shia]]) has cut ties with the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Hamas]] movement on account of the latter's support for the [[Syrian opposition|opposition]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]].

==Background==

===Religious aspects of the conflict===
Some groups opposed to the peace process invoke religious arguments for their uncompromising positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weinberger |first=Peter E. |title=Incorporating religion into israeli-palestinian peacemaking: recommendations for policymakers |publisher=Center for World Religions, Diplomacy, and Conflict Resolution, Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution, George Mason University |date=May 2004 |url=http://crdc.gmu.edu/docs/recommendations.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627002349/http://crdc.gmu.edu/docs/recommendations.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary history of the Arab–Israeli conflict is very much affected by the religious beliefs of the various sides and their views of the idea of the [[chosen people]] in their policies with regard to the "[[Promised Land]]" and the "Chosen City" of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Avi Beker, The Chosen: The History of an Idea and the Anatomy of an Obsession, New York: Palgrave Mcmillan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Land of [[Canaan]] or ''Eretz Yisrael'' ([[Land of Israel]]) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, [[Promised Land|promised]] by God to the [[Children of Israel]]. This is also mentioned in the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;Sura 17, "The Night Journey", verse 103&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1896 manifesto, ''The Jewish State'', [[Theodor Herzl]] repeatedly refers to the Biblical [[Promised Land]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/6640/zion/judenstaadt.html The State of the Jews], Theodor Hertzl, 1896, Translated from the German by Sylvie D'Avigdor, published in 1946 by the American Zionist Emergency Council. The original German title, "Der Judenstaat", literally means "The Jews' State". {{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/6640/zion/judenstaadt.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 May 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224031940/http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/6640/zion/judenstaadt.html |archivedate=24 December 2007 |df= }} 25 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Likud]] is currently the most prominent Israeli political party to include the Biblical claim to the [[Land of Israel]] in its platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Likud – Platform| publisher=Knesset.gov.il| url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm| accessdate =4 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081006145128/https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm| archivedate=6 October 2008 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims also claim rights to that land in accordance with the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name=JQ&gt;'Jerusalem in the Qur'an', Masjid Dar al-Qur'an, Long Island, New York. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the Jewish claim that this land was promised only to the descendants of [[Abraham]]'s grandson [[Jacob]] (''Yisrael''),&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''[[Legends of the Jews]] [http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf Vol II : Esau's Campaign Against Jacob]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.&lt;/ref&gt; they argue that the Land of Canaan was promised to what they consider the elder son of Abraham, [[Ishmael]], from whom [[Arabs]] claim descent.&lt;ref name=JQ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090224002549/http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/noncanon/ot/pseudo/jubilee.htm Book of Jubilees 20:13]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Muslims also revere many sites holy for Biblical Israelites, such as the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] and the [[Temple Mount]]. In the past 1,400 years, Muslims have constructed Islamic landmarks on these ancient Israelite sites, such as the [[Dome of the Rock]] and the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] on the [[Temple Mount]], the holiest site in Judaism. This has brought the two groups into conflict over the rightful possession of [[Jerusalem]]. Muslim teaching is that [[Muhammad]] passed through Jerusalem on his first journey to heaven. [[Hamas]], which governs the [[Gaza Strip]], claims that all of the land of Palestine (the current Israeli and Palestinian territories) is an Islamic ''[[waqf]]'' that must be governed by Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp |title=The Avalon Project : Hamas Covenant 1988 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date=18 August 1988 |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionists]] often support the State of Israel because of the ancestral right of the Jews to the Holy Land, as suggested, for instance, by [[Paul the Apostle|the apostle Paul]] in his letter to the [[:wikisource:Bible (World English)/Romans#Chapter 11|Romans, chapter 11]], in the [[Bible]]. Christian Zionism teaches that the return of Jews in Israel is a prerequisite for the [[Second Coming of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gracethrufaith.com/ikvot-hamashiach/seven-major-prophetic-signs-of-the-second-coming |title=Seven Major Prophetic Signs Of The Second Coming |publisher=Gracethrufaith.com |date=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcpa.org/article/sarah-schmidt-on-on-the-road-to-armageddon-how-evangelicals-became-israel%E2%80%99s-best-friend/ Review of ''On the Road to Armageddon: How Evangelicals Became Israel's Best Friend'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===National movements===
The roots of the modern Arab–Israeli conflict lie in the rise of [[Zionism]] and the reactionary [[Arab nationalism]] that arose in response to [[Zionism]] towards the end of the 19th century. Territory regarded by the [[Jewish people]] as their [[Homeland for the Jewish people|historical homeland]] is also regarded by the [[Pan-Arab]] movement as historically and presently belonging to the [[Palestinians|Palestinian Arabs]]. Before World War I, the Middle East, including Palestine (later [[Mandatory Palestine]]), had been under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] for nearly 400 years. During the closing years of their empire, the Ottomans began to espouse their Turkish ethnic identity, asserting the primacy of Turks within the empire, leading to discrimination against the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, T.G. ''The Middle East: 1914–1979''. St. Martin's Press, New York. (1980) Pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of liberation from the Ottomans led many Jews and Arabs to support the allied powers during World War I, leading to the emergence of widespread Arab nationalism. Both Arab nationalism and Zionism had their formulative beginning in Europe. The Zionist Congress was established in Basel in 1897, while the "Arab Club" was established in Paris in 1906.

In the late 19th century European and Middle Eastern Jewish communities began to increasingly immigrate to Palestine and purchase land from the local Ottoman landlords. The population of the late 19th century in Palestine reached 600,000 – mostly Muslim Arabs, but also significant minorities of Jews, Christians, Druze and some [[Samaritans]] and [[Bahai]]'s. At that time, Jerusalem did not extend beyond the walled area and had a population of only a few tens of thousands. Collective farms, known as [[kibbutz]]im, were established, as was the first entirely Jewish city in modern times, [[Tel Aviv]].

During 1915–16, as World War I was underway, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon, secretly corresponded with [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Husayn ibn 'Ali]], the patriarch of the Hashemite family and Ottoman governor of Mecca and Medina. McMahon convinced Husayn to lead an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire, which was aligned with Germany against Britain and France in the war. McMahon promised that if the Arabs supported Britain in the war, the British government would support the establishment of an independent Arab state under Hashemite rule in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire, including Palestine. The Arab revolt, led by [[T. E. Lawrence]] ("Lawrence of Arabia") and Husayn's son Faysal, was successful in defeating the Ottomans, and Britain took control over much of this area.

====First mandate years and the Franco-Syrian war====
In 1917, Palestine was conquered by the British forces (including the [[Jewish Legion]]). The British government issued the [[Balfour Declaration]], which stated that the government viewed favorably "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people" but "that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine". The Declaration was issued as a result of the belief of key members of the government, including Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], that Jewish support was essential to winning the war; however, the declaration caused great disquiet in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Segev, Tom (2000): ''One Palestine, Complete'', pp. 48–49, Abacus, {{ISBN|0-349-11286-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, the area came under British rule as the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. The area mandated to the British in 1923 included what is today Israel, the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. Transjordan eventually was carved into a separate British protectorate – the Emirate of Transjordan, which gained an autonomous status in 1928 and achieved complete independence in 1946 with the approval by the United Nations of the end of the British Mandate.

A major crisis among the Arab nationalists took place with the failed establishment of the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] in 1920. With the disastrous outcome of the Franco-Syrian War, the self-proclaimed Hashemite kingdom with its capital in Damascus was defeated and the Hashemite ruler took refuge in Mandatory Iraq. The crisis saw the first confrontation of nationalist Arab and Jewish forces, taking place in the [[Battle of Tel Hai]] in March 1920, but more importantly the collapse of the pan-Arabist kingdom led to the establishment of the local Palestinian version of Arab nationalism, with the return of [[Amin al-Husseini]] from Damascus to Jerusalem in late 1920.

At this point in time [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] to Mandatory Palestine continued, while to some opinions a similar, but less documented, immigration also took place in the Arab sector, bringing workers from Syria and other neighbouring areas. Palestinian Arabs saw this rapid influx of Jewish immigrants as a threat to their homeland and their identity as a people. Moreover, Jewish policies of purchasing land and prohibiting the employment of Arabs in Jewish-owned industries and farms greatly angered the Palestinian Arab communities.&lt;ref&gt;Lesch, Ann M. and Tschirgi, Dan. ''Origins and Development of the Arab-Israeli Conflict''. Greenwood Press: West Port, Connecticut. (1998). Pg.47,51&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=August 2012}} Demonstrations were held as early as 1920, protesting what the Arabs felt were unfair preferences for the Jewish immigrants set forth by the British mandate that governed Palestine at the time. This resentment led to outbreaks of violence later that year, as the al-Husseini incited [[1920 Palestine riots|riots]] broke out in Jerusalem. [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[Churchill White Paper|1922 White Paper]] tried to reassure the Arab population, denying that the creation of a Jewish state was the intention of the Balfour Declaration.

====1929 events====
[[1929 Palestine riots|In 1929]], after a demonstration by [[Vladimir Jabotinsky]]'s political group [[Betar]] at the [[Western Wall]], riots started in Jerusalem and expanded throughout Mandatory Palestine; Arabs murdered 67 Jews in the city of [[Hebron]], in what became known as the [[1929 Hebron massacre|Hebron massacre]]. During the week of the 1929 riots, at least 116 Arabs and 133 Jews&lt;ref&gt;''San Francisco Chronicle'', 9 August 2005, "A Time of Change; Israelis, Palestinians and the Disengagement"&lt;/ref&gt; were killed and 339 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;NA 59/8/353/84/867n, 404 Wailing Wall/279 and 280, Archdale Diary and Palestinian Police records.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s and 1940s====

By 1931, 17 percent of the population of Mandatory Palestine were Jews, an increase of six percent since 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Lesch, Ann M. and Tschirgi, Dan. ''Origins and Development of the Arab-Israeli Conflict''. Greenwood Press: West Port, Connecticut. (1998).

In the mid-1930s [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] arrived from Syria and established the [[Black Hand (Palestine)|Black Hand]], an anti-Zionist and anti-British militant organization. He recruited and arranged military training for peasants, and by 1935 he had enlisted between 200 and 800 men. The cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which they used to kill Jewish settlers in the area, as well as engaging in a campaign of vandalism of Jewish settler plantations.&lt;ref name=segev&gt;{{cite book |last=Segev |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Segev |title=One Palestine, Complete |year=1999 |publisher=Metropolitan Books |isbn=0-8050-4848-0 |pages=360–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1936, escalating tensions led to the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Lesch, Ann M. and Tschirgi, Dan.

These restrictions remained in place until the end of the mandate, a period which coincided with the Nazi [[Holocaust]] and the flight of [[Jewish refugees]] from Europe. As a consequence, most Jewish entrants to Mandatory Palestine were considered illegal (see [[Aliyah Bet]]), causing further tensions in the region. Following several failed attempts to solve the problem diplomatically, the British asked the newly formed United Nations for help. On 15 May 1947, the General Assembly appointed a committee, the [[UNSCOP]], composed of representatives from eleven states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/F5A49E57095C35B685256BCF0075D9C2 A/RES/106 (S-1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806072438/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/F5A49E57095C35B685256BCF0075D9C2 |date=6 August 2012 }} of 15 May 1947 General Assembly Resolution 106 Constituting the UNSCOP: Retrieved 12 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; To make the committee more neutral, none of the Great Powers were represented.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Charles D.

In the weeks prior to the end of the Mandate the [[Haganah]] launched a number of [[List of battles and operations in the 1948 Palestine war|offensives]] in which they gained control over all the territory allocated by the UN to the Jewish State, creating a large number of refugees and capturing the towns of [[Tiberias]], [[Haifa]], [[Safad]], [[Beisan]] and, in effect, [[Jaffa]].

===1948 Arab–Israeli War===
{{Main article|1948 Arab–Israeli War}}
On 14 May 1948, the day on which the British Mandate over Palestine expired, the [[Jewish People's Council]] gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum and approved a proclamation that declared [[Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel|the establishment]] of a [[Jewish state]] in [[Eretz Israel]], to be known as the [[State of Israel]]. The declaration was made by [[David Ben-Gurion]], the Executive Head of the [[World Zionist Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm |title=Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel: May 14, 1948 |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |accessdate=19 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116103234/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%2BProcess/Guide%2Bto%2Bthe%2BPeace%2BProcess/Declaration%2Bof%2BEstablishment%2Bof%2BState%2Bof%2BIsrael.htm |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no mention of the borders of the new state other than that it was in Eretz Israel. An official [[:s:Cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to the Secretary-General of the United Nations|cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States]] to the UN Secretary-General on 15 May 1948 stated publicly that Arab Governments found "themselves compelled to intervene for the sole purpose of restoring peace and security and establishing law and order in Palestine" (Clause 10(e)). Further in Clause 10(e): "The Governments of the Arab States hereby confirm at this stage the view that had been repeatedly declared by them on previous occasions, such as the London Conference and before the United Nations mainly, the only fair and just solution to the problem of Palestine is the creation of United State of Palestine based upon the democratic principles ..."

That day, the armies of [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], Lebanon, [[Syrian Republic (1946–63)|Syria]], Jordan and [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]] invaded what had just ceased to be the British Mandate, marking the beginning of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The nascent [[Israeli Defense Force]] repulsed the Arab nations from part of the occupied territories, thus extending its borders beyond the original UNSCOP partition.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Charles D. ''Palestine and the Arab Israeli Conflict: A History With Documents''. Bedford/St. Martin's: Boston. (2004). Pg. 198&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1948, Israel controlled most of the portion of Mandate Palestine west of the [[Jordan River]]. The remainder of the Mandate consisted of Jordan, the area that came to be called the [[West Bank]] (controlled by Jordan), and the [[Gaza Strip]] (controlled by Egypt). Prior to and during this conflict, 713,000&lt;ref&gt;GENERAL PROGRESS REPORT AND SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONCILIATION COMMISSION FOR PALESTINE, Covering the period from 11 December 1949 to 23 October 1950, GA A/1367/Rev.1 23 October 1950&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian Arabs fled their original lands to become [[Palestinian refugees]], in part due to [[Causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus#Outline of the historical debate|a promise]] from Arab leaders that they would be able to return when the war had been won, and also in part due to attacks on Palestinian villages and towns by Israeli forces and Jewish militant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Palestinian Diaspora|url=http://www.globalexchange.org/country/palestine/diaspora|publisher=Global Exchange|accessdate=12 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101221315/http://www.globalexchange.org/country/palestine/diaspora|archivedate=1 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Palestinians fled from the areas that are now Israel as a response to massacres of Arab towns by militant Jewish organizations like the [[Irgun]] and the [[Lehi (group)]] (See [[Deir Yassin massacre]]). The War came to an end with the signing of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] between Israel and each of its Arab neighbours.

The status of Jewish citizens in Arab states worsened during the 1948 Israeli-Arab war. Anti-Jewish riots erupted throughout the Arab World in December 1947, and Jewish communities were hit particularly hard in [[1947 Aleppo pogrom|Aleppo]] and British-controlled [[1947 Aden riots|Aden]], with hundreds of dead and injured. In [[Libya]], Jews were deprived of citizenship, and in Iraq, their property was seized.{{context inline|date=June 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aharoni |first=Ada |url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/content/w91udxrhc7cf5a86 |title=The Forced Migration of Jews from Arab Countries |publisher=Routledge, part of the Taylor &amp; Francis Group |volume=15 |issue=1 |date=March 2003 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt expelled most of its foreign community, including Jews, after the Suez War 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gorman |first=Anthony |title=Historians, State and Politics in Twentieth Century Egypt: Contesting the Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWE2i6PBJvIC&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Psychology Press |year=2003 |pages=174–5 |isbn=9780415297530}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Algeria denied its French citizens, including Jews, of citizenship upon its independence in 1962.

As a result of Israel's victory in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], any Arabs caught on the wrong side of the ceasefire line were unable to return to their homes in what became Israel. Likewise, any Jews on the West Bank or in Gaza were exiled from their property and homes to Israel.

The [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) destroyed most of the [[Egyptian Air Force]] in a surprise attack, then turned east to destroy the Jordanian, Syrian and Iraqi air forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Benny|title=Righteous victims : a history of the Zionist-Arab conflict, 1881–2001|year=2001|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-74475-4|pages=316–318|edition=1st Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strike was the crucial element in Israel's victory in the [[Six-Day War]].&lt;ref name="MFA: The Arab-Israeli Wars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JordanGov: The Disaster of 1967"/&gt; At the war's end, Israel had gained control of the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank (including [[East Jerusalem]]), [[Shebaa farms]], and the Golan Heights. The results of the war affect the geopolitics of the region to this day.

At the end of August 1967, Arab leaders [[Khartoum Resolution|met in Khartoum]] in response to the war, to discuss the Arab position toward Israel. They reached consensus that there should be no recognition, no peace, and no negotiations with the State of Israel, the so-called "three no's".&lt;ref name="SIS: President Mubarak Interview with Israeli TV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Politics/Presidency/President/Interview/000001/0401050300000000000154.htm |title=President Mubarak Interview with Israeli TV |accessdate=4 March 2007 |date=15 February 2006 |publisher=Egyptian State Information Service |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001621/http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Politics/Presidency/President/Interview/000001/0401050300000000000154.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Egypt initiated the [[War of Attrition]], with the goal of exhausting Israel into surrendering the Sinai Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Britannica: The War of Attrition"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-219430/Israel| title=Israel: The War of Attrition| accessdate=3 March 2007| work=Encyclopædia Britannica| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222164659/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-219430/Israel| archivedate=22 February 2007 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war ended following [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s death in 1970.

On 6 October 1973, Syria and Egypt staged a surprise attack on Israel on [[Yom Kippur]], the holiest day of the Jewish calendar. The Israeli military were caught off guard and unprepared, and took about three days to fully mobilize.&lt;ref name="Britannica: The Yom Kippur War"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-219432/Israel| title=Israel: The Yom Kippur War| accessdate=3 March 2007| work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encarta: Arab-Israeli War of 1973"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564886/Arab-Israeli_War_of_1973.html |title=Arab-Israeli War of 1973 |accessdate=4 March 2007 |publisher=Encarta Encyclopedia |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKa1wQy?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564886/Arab-Israeli_War_of_1973.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led other Arab states to send troops to reinforce the Egyptians and Syrians. In addition, these Arab countries agreed to enforce an oil embargo on industrial nations including the U.S, Japan and Western European Countries. These OPEC countries increased the price of oil fourfold, and used it as a political weapon to gain support against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Charles D.

When Israel had turned the tide of war, the USSR threatened military intervention.

===1974–2000===

====Egypt====
{{Further|Egypt–Israel relations}}
[[File:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|right|thumb|Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David]]
Following the [[Camp David Accords]] of the late 1970s, Israel and Egypt signed a [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty]] in March 1979. Under its terms, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] returned to Egyptian hands, and the Gaza Strip remained under Israeli control, to be included in a future [[Palestinian state]]. The agreement also provided for the free passage of Israeli ships through the Suez Canal and recognition of the [[Straits of Tiran]] and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] as international waterways.

====Jordan====
{{Further|Israel–Jordan relations}}
In October 1994, Israel and Jordan signed a [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty|peace agreement]], which stipulated mutual cooperation, an end of hostilities, the fixing of the Israel-Jordan border, and a resolution of other issues. The conflict between them had cost roughly 18.3 billion dollars. Its signing is also closely linked with the efforts to create peace between Israel and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) representing the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA). It was signed at the southern border crossing of Arabah on 26 October 1994 and made Jordan only the second Arab country (after Egypt) to sign a peace accord with Israel.

====Iraq====
{{Further|Iraq–Israel relations}}
Israel and Iraq have been implacable foes since 1948. Iraq sent its troops to participate in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], and later backed Egypt and Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War and in the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

In June 1981, Israel attacked and destroyed newly built Iraqi nuclear facilities in [[Operation Opera]].

During the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, Iraq fired 39 [[Scud]] missiles into Israel, in the hopes of uniting the Arab world against the coalition which sought to liberate [[Kuwait]]. At the behest of the United States, Israel did not respond to this attack in order to prevent a greater outbreak of war.

====Lebanon====
{{Further|Israeli–Lebanese conflict|Israel–Lebanon relations|Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon}}
In 1970, following an extended [[Black September in Jordan|civil war]], King Hussein expelled the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] from Jordan. September 1970 is known as the Black September in Arab history and sometimes is referred to as the "era of regrettable events". It was a month when Hashemite King Hussein of Jordan moved to quash the autonomy of Palestinian organisations and restore his monarchy's rule over the country.&lt;ref&gt;Shlaim. Avi. ''Lion of Jordan; The life of King Hussein in War in Peace'', 2007, pg. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; The violence resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people, the vast majority Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;Massad, Joseph Andoni. "Colonial Effects: The Making of National Identity in Jordan", pg. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Armed conflict lasted until July 1971 with the expulsion of the PLO and thousands of Palestinian fighters to Lebanon. The PLO resettled in Lebanon, from which it staged raids into Israel. In 1978, Israel launched [[Operation Litani]], in which it together with the [[South Lebanon Army]] forced the PLO to retreat north of the Litani river. In 1981 another conflict between Israel and the PLO broke out, which ended with a ceasefire agreement that did not solve the core of the conflict. In June 1982, [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel invaded Lebanon]]. Within two months the PLO agreed to withdraw thence.

In March 1983, Israel and Lebanon signed a ceasefire agreement. However, Syria pressured President [[Amine Gemayel]] into nullifying the truce in March 1984. By 1985, Israeli forces withdrew to a 15&amp;nbsp;km wide southern strip of Lebanon, following which the conflict continued on a lower scale, with relatively low casualties on both sides. In 1993 and 1996, Israel launched major operations against the Shiite militia of [[Hezbollah]], which had become an emergent threat. In May 2000, the newly elected government of [[Ehud Barak]] authorized a withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, fulfilling an election promise to do so well ahead of a declared deadline. The hasty withdrawal lead to the immediate collapse of the [[South Lebanon Army]], and many members either got arrested or fled to Israel.

====Palestinians====
{{Further|Israeli–Palestinian conflict}}
The 1970s were marked by a large number of major, international terrorist attacks, including the [[Lod Airport massacre]] and the [[Munich massacre|Munich Olympics Massacre]] in 1972, and the [[Operation Entebbe|Entebbe Hostage Taking]] in 1976, with over 100 Jewish hostages of different nationalities kidnapped and held in Uganda.

In December 1987, the [[First Intifada]] began. The First Intifada was a mass Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the [[Palestinian territories]].&lt;ref&gt;"Uprising by Palestinians against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip territories", Intifada, Microsoft Encarta.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion began in the Jabalia refugee camp and quickly spread throughout Gaza and the West Bank. Palestinian actions ranged from civil disobedience to violence. In addition to general strikes, boycotts on Israeli products, graffiti and barricades, Palestinian demonstrations that included stone-throwing by youths against the Israel Defense Forces brought the Intifada international attention. The Israeli army's heavy handed response to the demonstrations, with live ammunition, beatings and mass arrests, brought international condemnation. The PLO, which until then had never been recognised as the leaders of the Palestinian people by Israel, was invited to peace negotiations the following year, after it recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.
[[File:Bill Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat at the White House 1993-09-13.jpg|right|thumb|[[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Yasser Arafat]] at the Oslo Accords signing ceremony on 13 September 1993]]
In mid-1993, Israeli and Palestinian representatives engaged in peace talks in Oslo, Norway. As a result, in September 1993, Israel and the PLO signed the [[Oslo Accords]], known as the ''Declaration of Principles'' or Oslo I; in [[Israel–Palestine Liberation Organization letters of recognition|side letters]], Israel recognized the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people while the PLO recognized the right of the state of Israel to exist and renounced terrorism, violence and its desire for the destruction of Israel.

The Oslo II agreement was signed in 1995 and detailed the division of the West Bank into [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|Areas A, B, and C]]. Area A was land under full Palestinian civilian control. In Area A, Palestinians were also responsible for internal security. The Oslo agreements remain important documents in Israeli-Palestinian relations.

===2000–05===
The [[Second Intifada]] forced Israel to rethink its relationship and policies towards the Palestinians. Following a [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|series of suicide bombings]] and attacks, the Israeli army launched [[Operation Defensive Shield]]. It was the largest military operation conducted by Israel since the Six-Day War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Yedioth Aharonoth Books and Chemed Books and it had a very big conflict|isbn =978-965-511-767-7|last=Harel|first=Amos|author2=Avi Isacharoff|title=The Seventh War|pages=274–275|location=Tel Aviv|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As violence between the Israeli army and Palestinian militants intensified, Israel expanded its security apparatus around the West Bank by re-taking many parts of land in Area A. Israel established a complicated system of roadblocks and [[Border checkpoint|checkpoints]] around major Palestinian areas to deter violence and protect Israeli settlements. However, since 2008, the IDF has slowly transferred authority to Palestinian security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=172860 |title=PA security forces seize 17 bombs, transfer them to IDF |work=The Jerusalem Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=178633 |title=UN: Israel has dismantled 20 percent of West Bank checkpoint |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz |first=Yaakov |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=170599 |title=Israel sets up trial program to expedite PA export process |work=The Jerusalem Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's then prime minister [[Ariel Sharon]] began a policy of [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza|disengagement]] from the [[Gaza Strip]] in 2003. This policy was fully implemented in August 2005.&lt;ref name="Special Update: Disengagement – August 2005"&gt;"[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern+History/Historic+Events/Disengagement+-+August+2005.htm Special Update: Disengagement – August 2005]", Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon's announcement to disengage from Gaza came as a tremendous shock to his critics both on the left and on the right. A year previously, he had commented that the fate of the most far-flung settlements in Gaza, Netzararem and Kfar Darom, was regarded in the same light as that of Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;Ma'ariv II December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The formal announcements to evacuate seventeen Gaza settlements and another four in the West Bank in February 2004 represented the first reversal for the settler movement since 1968. It divided his party. It was strongly supported by Trade and Industry Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] and [[Tzipi Livni]], the Minister for Immigration and Absorption, but Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom and Finance Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] strongly condemned it. It was also uncertain whether this was simply the beginning of further evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;Shindler, Colin. ''A History of Modern Israel'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008, pg. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift to Iranian conflict (2006–present)===
{{see|Iran-Israel proxy conflict}}
In June 2006, [[Hamas]] militants infiltrated an army post near the Israeli side of the Gaza Strip and abducted Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]]. Two IDF soldiers were killed in the attack, while Shalit was wounded after his tank was hit with an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]].

==Cost of conflict==
{{See also|Arab League boycott of Israel}}
A report by [[Strategic Foresight Group]] has estimated the [[opportunity cost]] of conflict for the Middle East from 1991–2010 at $12 trillion. The report's opportunity cost calculates the peace GDP of countries in the Middle East by comparing the current GDP to the potential GDP in times of peace. Israel's share is almost $1 trillion, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia having approximately $2.2 and $4.5 trillion, respectively. In other words, had there been peace and cooperation between Israel and Arab League nations since 1991, the average Israeli citizen would be earning over $44,000 instead of $23,000 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/Cost%20of%20Conflict%20-%206%20pager.pdf |title=''Cost of Conflict in the Middle East'', Strategic Foresight Group |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201053723/http://www.strategicforesight.com/Cost%20of%20Conflict%20-%206%20pager.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the human cost, it is estimated that the conflict has taken 92,000 lives (74,000 military and 18,000 civilian from 1945 to 1995).&lt;ref name="buzan"&gt;{{cite book| last=Buzan | first=Barry | title=Regions and powers | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2003 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N3LfkrrNM4QC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=arab-israeli+fatalities | accessdate=21 April 2009| isbn=978-0-521-89111-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20611">'''Archaeological theory''' refers to the various intellectual frameworks through which [[archaeology|archaeologists]] interpret archaeological data. Archaeological theory functions as the application of [[philosophy of science]] to archaeology, and is occasionally referred to as '''[[philosophy of archaeology]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=-x9RwN3HjhgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Can There be a Philosophy of Archaeology?: Processual Archaeology and the Philosophy of Science|last=Krieger|first=William Harvey|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739112496|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dark|first=Ken|date=2016|title=The Science of Archaeology|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/3/The_Science_of_Archaeology|journal=Philosophy Now|volume=|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no one singular theory of archaeology, but many, with different archaeologists believing that information should be interpreted in different ways. Throughout the history of the discipline, various trends of support for certain archaeological theories have emerged, peaked, and in some cases died out. Different archaeological theories differ on what the goals of the discipline are and how they can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some archaeological theories, such as [[processual archaeology]], holds that archaeologists are able to develop accurate, [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] information about past societies by applying the [[scientific method]] to their investigations, whilst others, such as [[post-processual archaeology]], dispute this, and claim all archaeological data is tainted by human interpretation and social factors, and any interpretation they make about past societies is therefore [[Subjectivity|subjective]].&lt;ref&gt;Trigger 2007: 01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other archaeological theories, such as [[Marxist archaeology]], instead interpret archaeological evidence within a framework for how its proponents believe society operates. Marxist archaeologists in general believe that the bipolarism that exists between the processual and post-processual debates is an opposition inherent within knowledge production and is in accord with a dialectical understanding of the world. Many Marxist archaeologists believe that it is this polarism within the anthropological discipline (and all academic disciplines) that fuels the questions that spur progress in archaeological theory and knowledge. This constant interfacing and conflict between the extremes of the two heuristic playing grounds (subjective vs. objective) is believed to result in a continuous reconstruction of the past by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGuire 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Since the early 20th century, most accounts of archaeological methodology have accepted the data that is uncovered by the archaeologist is subsequently interpreted through a theoretical viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hod99|Hodder 1999]]. p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the archaeological community is divided over the extent to which theory pervades the discipline. On one side, there are those who believe that certain archaeological techniques &amp;ndash; such as excavation or recording &amp;ndash; are neutral and outside of the bounds of theory, while on the other are those who believe that these too are also influenced by theoretical considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Joh10|Johnson 2010]]. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Ian Hodder]], a prominent advocate of the latter view, criticised the alternate approach by highlighting that methodological decisions, such as where to open a trench, how diligently to excavate a stratigraphic layer and whether to keep every artefact discovered, are all based on prior theoretical interpretations of the site, and that even excavatory techniques could not therefore escape the realm of theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hod99|Hodder 1999]]. pp. 80&amp;ndash;82.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who take the former approach have sometimes tried to separate the raw data from the theoretical interpretations in their publications, but have come under criticism from those, such as Hodder, who argue that theoretical interpretation pervades the entire archaeological methodology, and therefore cannot be separated from the raw data.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hod99|Hodder 1999]]. pp. 80&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iowa archaeology edgewater.JPG|thumb|Archaeologists such as Matthew Johnson have argued that most, if not all, aspects of archaeology are informed by theoretical considerations.]]
In his overview of archaeological theory, the archaeologist Matthew Johnson of the [[University of Southampton]] put forward four arguments for why theory was so important to the archaeological discipline, and therefore why all archaeologists should learn about the subject. First, he noted that all of the arguments for why archaeology benefited society were based in theory, and that archaeologists wanting to defend their discipline from its critics would therefore require a grounding in theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Joh10|Johnson 2010]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, he highlighted that theory was required to compare two different interpretations of the past and decide which one was the more likely.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Joh10|Johnson 2010]]. pp. 4&amp;ndash;5.&lt;/ref&gt; Third, he asserted that theory was needed for the archaeologist to accept and admit to their own personal biases and agendas in interpreting the material evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Joh10|Johnson 2010]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Johnson put forward what he considered to be the most important reason for the necessity of understanding theory; that all archaeologists, as human beings, are innately theoretical, in that they naturally make use of "theories, concepts, ideas, assumptions" in their work. As such, he asserts that any archaeologist claiming to be "atheoretical" is mistaken, and that in actuality they cloud their own theoretical position under such jargon as "common sense". He proceeded to suggest that most of those western archaeologists who claim to eschew theory in favour of a "common sense" approach were actually exhibiting cultural ''machismo'' by playing on the stereotype that intelligent discussions and debates were [[effeminacy|effeminate]] and therefore of lesser value.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Joh10|Johnson 2010]]. pp. 5&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological theories ==

=== Antiquarianism (antiquities collection) and Imperial synthesis (ancient times through c1880) ===
(''see also: [[History of archaeology]]'')

People's interest of the past has existed since antiquity.  During the Western world's Medieval period six main concepts were formed that would come to influence archaeological theory to some degree:

1) The world is of recent, supernatural origin at best no more than a few thousand years old

2) The physical world has degraded since God's original creation

3) Humanity was created in the Garden of Eden 

4) Standards of human conduct naturally degrade

5) History of the world is a sequence of unique events

6) Culturally, socially, and intellectually the people of the past were identical to the present&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, Bruce  (1986) ''A History of Archeological Thought'' Cambridge University Press pg 57-58&lt;/ref&gt;

The coming of the Renaissance stimulated an interest in the past but it was more on the level of collecting artifacts and romanticized theories of their origin.  It was not until the 19th century the first elements of actual systematic study of older civilizations began but they tended to be designed to support imperial nationalism.

=== Cultural-historical (historical particularism, national archeology) archaeology (c1860-present) ===

Developments in the 19th century with [[James Hutton|Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]]'s theory of [[uniformitarianism]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]] set the stage for the modern scientific investigation into the origin of humanity.&lt;ref name="galilean-library"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galilean-library.org/site/index.php/page/index.html/_/essays/history/philosophy-and-the-new-archaeology-r78|title=Philosophy and the New Archaeology - History - Resources - Resources - The Galilean Library|publisher=galilean-library.org|accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Darwin came a mode of archaeology known as '''[[Cultural-history archaeology|cultural, or culture history]]''', according to which sites are grouped into distinct "cultures" to determine the geographic spread and time span of these cultures and to reconstruct the interactions and flow of ideas between them. Cultural history, as the name suggests, was closely allied with the science of [[history]]. Cultural historians employed the ''[[normative model of culture]]'', the principle that each culture is a set of norms governing human behaviour. Thus, cultures can be distinguished by patterns of craftsmanship; for instance, if one excavated [[sherd]] of pottery is decorated with a triangular pattern, and another sherd with a chequered pattern, they likely belong to different cultures. Such an approach naturally leads to a view of the past as a collection of different populations, classified by their differences and by their influences on each other. Changes in behaviour could be explained by [[Diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]] whereby new ideas moved, through social and economic ties, from one culture to another. 

The Australian archaeologist [[Vere Gordon Childe]] was one of the first to explore and expand this concept of the relationships between cultures especially in the context of prehistoric Europe. By the 1920s sufficient archaeological material had been excavated and studied to suggest that diffusionism was not the only mechanism through which change occurred. Influenced by the political upheaval of the inter-war period Childe then argued that [[revolution]]s had wrought major changes in past societies. He conjectured a [[Neolithic Revolution]], which inspired people to settle and farm rather than hunt nomadically. This would have led to considerable changes in social organisation, which Childe argued led to a second [[Urban Revolution]] that created the first [[city|cities]]. Such macro-scale thinking was in itself revolutionary and Childe's ideas are still widely admired and respected.

====Historical particularism (c1880-c1940)====

[[Franz Boas]] argued that cultures were unique entities shaped by a unique sequence of events.  As a result there was no universal standard by which one culture could be compared with another.  This line of thought combined with John Lubbock's concept that Western civilization would overwhelm and eventually destroy primitive cultures resulted in anthropologists recording mountains of information on primitive peoples before they vanished.

====National archeology (c1916-present)====

National archaeology used cultural-historical concepts to instill pride and raise the morale of certain nationalities or racial groups and in many countries it remains the dominate method of archeology.

====Soviet archaeology (1917-present)====

Adapting some of the concepts of Darwinian [[natural selection]] for use outside of the discipline of evolutionary biology while employing the Marxist historical-economic theory of [[dialectical materialism]], Soviet archaeologists resumed the method of use-wear analysis and, beginning in the 1930s, tried to explain observed changes in the archaeological record in terms of internal social dynamics.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

====Social archeology (UK) (c1922-present)====

=== Processual archaeology (New Archaeology) ===

In the 1960s, a number of young, primarily American archaeologists, such as [[Lewis Binford]], rebelled against the paradigms of cultural history. They proposed a "New Archaeology", which would be more "scientific" and "anthropological". They came to see culture as a set of behavioural processes and traditions. (In time, this view gave rise to the term '''[[processual archaeology]]'''). Processualists borrowed from the [[exact sciences]] the idea of [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]]. They believed that an archaeologist should develop one or more hypotheses about a culture under study, and conduct excavations with the intention of testing these hypotheses against fresh evidence. They had also become frustrated with the older generation's teachings through which [[culture]]s had taken precedence over the people being studied themselves. It was becoming clear, largely through the evidence of anthropology, that [[ethnic group]]s and their development were not always entirely congruent with the cultures in the [[archaeological record]].

=== Behavioural archaeology ===

An approach to the study of archaeological materials formulated by [[Michael Brian Schiffer|Michael B. Schiffer]] in the mid-1970s that privileged the analysis of [[human behaviour]] and individual actions, especially in terms of the making, using, and disposal of [[material culture]]. In particular this focused on observing and understanding what people actually did, while refraining from considering people’s thoughts and intentions in explaining that behaviour. A related area is [[Human behavioral ecology]], which models material traces of human behaviour in terms of adaptations and optimisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwick|first1=Ben|title=Multiple Optima in Hoabinhian flaked stone artefact palaeoeconomics and palaeoecology at two archaeological sites in Northwest Thailand|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|date=December 2013|volume=32|issue=4|pages=553–564|doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2013.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-processual archaeology ===
In the 1980s, a new movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]], [[Christopher Tilley]], [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] and [[Ian Hodder]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to science and impartiality by claiming that every archaeologist is in fact biased by his or her personal experience and background, and thus truly scientific archaeological work is difficult or impossible. This is especially true in archaeology where experiments (excavations) cannot possibly be repeatable by others as the [[scientific method]] dictates. Exponents of this relativistic method, called '''[[post-processual archaeology]]''', analysed not only the material remains they excavated, but also themselves, their attitudes and opinions. The different approaches to archaeological evidence which every person brings to his or her interpretation result in different [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]]s of the past for each individual. The benefit of this approach has been recognised in such fields as visitor interpretation, cultural resource management and ethics in archaeology as well as fieldwork. It has also been seen to have parallels with culture history.  Processualists critique it, however, as without scientific merit.  They point out that analysing yourself doesn't make a hypothesis any more valid, since a scientist will likely be more biased about himself than about artifacts.  And even if you can't perfectly replicate digs, one should try to follow science as rigorously as possible.  After all, perfectly scientific experiments can be performed on artifacts recovered or system theories constructed from dig information.

Post-processualism provided an umbrella for all those who decried the processual model of culture, which many feminist and neo-Marxist archaeologists for example believed treated people as mindless automatons and ignored their individuality.

==Global scope==
This divergence of archaeological theory has not progressed identically in all parts of the world where archaeology is conducted or in the many sub-fields of the discipline. Traditional heritage attractions often retain an ostensibly straightforward Culture History element in their interpretation material whilst university archaeology departments provide an environment to explore more abstruse methods of understanding and explaining the past. Australian archaeologists, and many others who work with indigenous peoples whose ideas of heritage differ from western concepts, have embraced post-processualism. Professional archaeologists in the United States however are predominantly processualist [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/prehistoric/past/past26.html#Nashville] and this last approach is common in other countries where commercial [[Cultural Resources Management]] is practised.

==Development==
In 1973, [[David L. Clarke|David Clarke]] of [[Cambridge University]] would publish an [[academic paper]] in ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' claiming that as a discipline, archaeology had moved from its original "noble innocence" through to "self-consciousness" and then onto "critical self-consciousness", a symptom of which was the increasing recognition and emphasis on archaeological theory. As a result, he argued, archaeology had suffered a "loss of innocence" as archaeologists became sceptical of the work of their forebears.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cla73|Clarke 1973]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The impact of ideology==
Archaeology has been and remains a cultural, gender and political battlefield. Many groups have tried to use archaeology to prove some current cultural or political point. [[Marxism|Marxist]] or Marxist-influenced archaeologists in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (among others) often try to prove the truth of [[dialectical materialism]] or to highlight the past (and present) role of conflict between interest groups (e.g. male vs. female, elders vs. juniors, workers vs. owners) in generating social change. Some contemporary cultural groups have tried, with varying degrees of success, to use archaeology to prove their historic right to ownership of an area of land. Many schools of archaeology have been patriarchal, assuming that in prehistory men produced most of the food by hunting, and women produced little nutrition by gathering; more recent studies have exposed the inadequacy of many of these theories. Some used the "Great Ages" theory implicit in the [[three-age system]] to argue continuous upward progress by Western civilisation. Much contemporary archaeology is influenced by neo-Darwinian evolutionary thought, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[Feminist archaeology]] and [[Systems theory in archaeology|Systems theory]].

'''Arthur Moeller van den Bruck''' (23 April 1876 – 30 May 1925) was a German cultural historian and writer, best known for his controversial 1923 book ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'' (''The Third Reich''), which promoted German nationalism and was a strong influence on the [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]] and later the [[Nazi Party]]. He did not support the party, however. From 1906 to 1922, he also published [[Elisabeth Kaerrick]]'s first full German translation of [[Dostoyevsky]]'s works.

==Biography==
'''Arthur Wilhelm Ernst Victor Moeller van den Bruck''' was born on 23 April 1876 in [[Solingen]], [[Westphalia]] as the only child of [[bourgeois]] parents. His father was Ottomar Victor Moeller, a German [[state architect]], and his mother was Elise van den Bruck, the daughter of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] architect [[van den Broeck]] and—allegedly—a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] mother. At birth Moeller van den Broek was assigned the [[given name|first name]] "Arthur" (in honor of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]), but he would later drop the part from his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lauryssens | first = Stan | title = The man who invented the Third Reich : the life and times of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck | publisher = Sutton | location = Stroud, Gloucestershire England | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7509-1866-7 | page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was expelled from a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (a type of German secondary school) for his indifference towards his studies. The young Moeller van den Bruck believed German literature and philosophy, particularly the works of [[Nietzsche]] to be a more vital education.&lt;ref&gt;G Krebs, Moeller van den Bruck: Inventor of the Third Reich, The American Political Science Review, Vol. 35, No. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he continued his studies on his own in [[Berlin]], [[Paris]], and [[Italy]].

In 1897 he married [[Hedda Eulenberg|Hedda Maase]] (later Eulenberg). She divorced him in 1904.

Moeller van den Bruck's eight-volume cultural history ''Die Deutschen, unsere Menschengeschichte'' ("The Germans, our people's history") appeared in 1905. In 1907 he returned to Germany and in 1914 enlisted in the army at the start of [[World War I]].  Soon thereafter, he joined the press office of the Foreign Ministry and was attached to the foreign affairs section of the German [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Supreme Army Command]].

His essay "''Der Preußische Stil''" ("The Prussian Style"), in which he celebrated the essence of Prussia as "the will to the state", appeared in 1916, marking his embrace of [[nationalism]]. It showed him as an opponent of [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[liberalism]], and exerted a strong influence on the Jungkonservativen ("young conservative movement").

After a [[nervous breakdown]], he committed [[suicide]] in [[Berlin]] on May 30, 1925.

Moeller van den Bruck was the joint founder of the "June Club" (Juniklub), which sought to influence young conservatives in the fight against the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Later, it was renamed "Deutscher Herrenklub" (German Gentlemen's Club): it became very powerful, helping [[Franz von Papen]] to become [[Reichskanzler]] in 1932.

== Influence on Nazism ==
In his 1918 book ''Das Recht der jungen Völker'' ("The Right Of Young Nations"), Moeller van den Bruck presents a version of the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' theory, in which he developed the theme of Russia as representing Communist civilization and the United States representing capitalist civilization, both of which are rejected. Germany is held up as the model between the two extremes. In the same book, Moeller van den Bruck advocated an expressly anti-Western and anti-imperialist philosophy of the state (''Staatstheorie''), which attempted to bridge the gap between nationalism and concepts of social justice.

He had a major influence on the ''Jungkonservativen'' (Young Conservatives) in their opposition to the [[Weimar Republic]]. He may have also supplied the Nazis with some of the concepts underpinning their movement, though upon meeting Hitler in 1922, Bruck rejected him for his "proletarian primitiveness". The Nazis still made use of his ideas where they could, including appropriating the title of his 1923 book ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'' (meaning "[[The Third Reich]]") as a political slogan and the Germanic ''Übermensch'' idea.

'''Ashley Lambie Cowie''' (born 1973) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] historian, author, photographer, television presenter and producer.

He grew up in the [[Caithness]] town of [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]], in the north of Scotland, and attended [[Wick High School]]. He then moved to Glasgow to study photography and audio visual communications. After returning north and establishing a number of businesses, including a [[fishmongers]] business for ten years in Wick and [[Thurso]],&lt;ref name=johnogroats&gt;[http://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/News/Wicks-Ashley-hits-stardom-on-TV-in-US-07092011.htm  Will Clark, "Wick's Ashley hits stardom on TV in US", ''John O'Groat Journal and Caithness Courier'', 7 September 2011]. Retrieved 11 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Cowie began exploring his interest in archaeology and [[cryptography]]. He has been commissioned to investigate and decode several ancient carved symbols for historical and research societies, including a group of Scottish [[Knights Templar]]. The author of ''The Rosslyn Matrix'' (2007) he also lectures on The International Science Festival circuit and was featured on the [[Discovery Channel]] in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luath.co.uk/authors/ashley-lambie-cowie  Ashley Lambie Cowie, ''The Luath Press'']. Retrieved 11 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research, publications and media career==
Beginning in 1993, Cowie explored the landscapes of northern Scotland and over the following decade he discovered many prehistoric artefacts including Meolithic &amp; Neolithic flint scatters and carved artefacts. In 2000, Cowie was involved in field walking projects in Caithness which revealed lithic scatters around the shores of Loch Watten and Yarrows, which was new evidence of early prehistoric settlement in Caithness. He went on to discover some of the first flint tools from the Mesolithic lithic scatter at Oliclett in the Yarrows basin which became one of the most significant archeological digs in British history. Cowie began presenting his work in up-beat lectures at the International Science Festival &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oisf.org/ International Science Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Orkney]] where his lecture entitled ''The Rope Age'' received a standing ovation from over 100 of the world's most acclaimed professors of archaeology. After this lecture, Cowie was elected as a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] and his work was featured in several ''Scotsman'' newspaper features.

Between 2002 and 2009, Cowie was privately commissioned to conduct research projects at various historic locations and during this time his discoveries in the architecture and symbols of [[Rosslyn Chapel]] were published in the best selling "The Book of Hiram", where he is credited for having discovered one of the earliest mapping systems known to date. In his own books, ''The Rosslyn Matrix'' (2007)&lt;ref&gt;''The Rosslyn Matrix'' (2007) {{ISBN|978-0-955-36230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Rosslyn Templar'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;''The Rosslyn Templar'' (2009) {{ISBN|978-1-906-30787-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he detailed the possible connections between the [[Clan Sinclair]], the chapel and the activities of the [[Knights Templar]].&lt;ref name=DPPA&gt;{{cite news | author =Oliver Farramond | title =New clues in Da Vinci Code’s Rosslyn Chapel | publisher = Deadline Press &amp; Picture Agency | date =4 September 2009 | url =http://deadlinescotland.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/9341-1765/ | accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Kath Gourlay | title = From St Clair to Sinclair – the family who built Rosslyn | publisher =The Scotsman | date =12 May 2006 | url =http://news.scotsman.com/rosslynchapel/From-St-Clair-to-Sinclair.2774883.jp | accessdate=10 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowie's last book 'The Super Star - America's Royal Secret' 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashleycowie.com/the-super-star.html 'The Super Star - America's Royal Secret'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425041620/http://www.ashleycowie.com/the-super-star.html |date=25 April 2012 }} Retrieved 2012-04-26&lt;/ref&gt; solves a long-standing historical mystery recounting his discovery of an ancient map, which leads him on an adventure through the [[Scottish Highlands]] and finally to a far-flung island where he discovers evidence of the, pre-Columbian, [[Vinland|Norse discovery of America]].

In 2009, Cowie became Resident Historian on STV's ''The Hour Show'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100306023433/http://programmes.stv.tv/the-hour The Hour Show]&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote and presented a series of live TV episodes discussing the origins of Scottish traditions and superstitions. At this time the Scottish media branded him "The Hunky Historian". He next appeared as an expert/sceptical historian on [[Sky Living]] TV's 2010 ''[[Most Haunted Live|Paranormal Investigation Live]]'' where he analysed apparently supernatural occurrences and debunked them with logic and reason. Cowie also appeared as an expert historian in [[History Channel]]'s ''Holy Grail in America''. In 2011, Cowie was credited as producer, writer and host, of [[NBC Universal]]'s TV series, ''[[Legend Quest]]''. This fast-paced, cinematic, action-adventure series followed Cowie as he travelled the world in search of history's greatest and most mysterious artifacts. Each of the six one-hour episodes include [[Indiana Jones| Indiana Jones-type]] adventure and [[The Da Vinci Code|''Da Vinci Code''-style]] puzzle solving. In ''Legend Quest'', Cowie hacked through dense jungles, dived in volcanic lakes, trekked through forbidding deserts and climbed some of the highest mountains in the [[Andes#Peru|Peruvian Andes]]. The show premiered on [[SyFy|Syfy Channel]] on 13 July 2011 attracting 1.2 million viewers, boosting SyFy's ratings by 19%. The series is a co-production from [[BASE Productions]]' John Brenkus and Mickey Stern and [[Universal Networks International]].  ''Legend Quest'' has aired in the US, Canada, Australia, Asia and Europe and premiered in the UK on SyFy Channel on 23 April 2012.

Cowie's research was featured in the ''[[Scottish Sun]]'' 's ''2012 Lost Treasure Week'', where he wrote several articles about his searches for various lost treasures. Cowie recently featured in the documentary series ''Great Estates Scotland'', which aired on [[PBS]] in the US and on [[History Channel]] elsewhere. In 2015 he discovered a witches' stella stone and a wizards' grave, details of which he published on ashleycowie.com. He also published the results of a 12 year long research project in which he has amassed the world's largest photographic and topographical collection on kerbstone stonemasons' marks. In 2016 Cowie published two new non-fiction historical books: ''Secret Viking Sea Chart'' and ''A Twist in Time''. He also teamed up with BBC journalist [[Sarah Mack]] to present a new series of ''The People's History Show'' on STV, beginning on 6 September 2016. Taking a look back in time to discover the stories that make up Scotland's people's history, the first episode covered the tragic story of [[Benny Lynch]], Scotland's greatest boxer, the grisly tale of Aberdeen's 19th century body-snatchers,and the bizarre death in Edinburgh of one of the world's great illusionists.

==Staffing==
According to a report by [[Reuters]], Bureau 121 is staffed by some of North Korea's most talented computer experts and is run by the Korean military.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt; A defector indicated that the agency has about 1,800 specialists.

==Targets and methods==
The activities of the agency came to public attention in December 2014 when [[Sony Pictures]] canceled the opening of its movie ''[[The Interview]]'' after its computers [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack|had been hacked]].&lt;ref name= variety-interviewdropped&gt;{{cite web|title=Major U.S. Theaters Drop 'The Interview' After Sony Hacker Threats|url= https://variety.com/2014/film/news/major-u-s-theaters-drop-the-interview-after-sony-hacker-threats-1201381861/ |website= Variety | accessdate =December 17, 2014 | last1 = Lang | first1 = Brett }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/18/politics/u-s-will-respond-to-north-korea-hack/ | first1 =Pamela | last1 = Brown | first2 = Jim | last2 = Sciutto | first3 = Evan | last3 = Perez | first4 = Jim | last4 = Acosta | first5 = Eric | last5 = Bradner |title=U.S. will respond to North Korea hack, official says| publisher = [[CNN]] |date=December 18, 2014| accessdate = December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bureau 121 has been blamed for the cyber breach, but North Korea has rejected this accusation.&lt;ref name = abc /&gt;

'''Desiderius of Vienne''' (died 607) was a [[martyr]]ed [[Ancient Diocese of Vienne|archbishop of Vienne]] and a chronicler.

== Life ==
Nothing is known about his early years. In 603, in a conflict with [[Brunhilda of Austrasia]], the legitimacy of whose children he had attacked,&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward James (historian)|Edward James]], ''The Origins of France'' (1982), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; he was deposed after she combined forces with [[Aridius (bishop)|Aridius]], [[bishop of Lyon]]. He was [[stoning|stoned to death]], some years later,&lt;ref&gt;Jo Ann McNamara, John E. Halborg, E. Gordon Whatley, ''Sainted Women of the Dark Ages'' (1992), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; at the order of King [[Theuderic II|Theuderic II of Burgundy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breviary.net/martyrology/mart05/mart0523.htm May 23] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012033504/http://breviary.net/martyrology/mart05/mart0523.htm |date=2011-10-12 }}.'' The Roman Martyrology.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was rebuked by [[Gregory the Great]] for his interest in the pagan [[classics]], in a letter provoked by the schooling he was providing for his clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Gian Biagio Conte, ''Latin Literature: A History'' (1994 translation), p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veneration ==
He is [[veneration|venerated]] as a [[saint]] in the [[Catholic Church]], with his [[Calendar of Saints|feast days]] on February 11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalist.net/calendar/feb.htm On-line Calendar of Saints Days, February&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], his feast is celebrated on May 23.&lt;ref name=Ort/&gt; A [[hagiography|hagiographical]] work was written about him by the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic king]] [[Sisebuto]], during the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Bryan Ward-Perkins, ''The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization'' (2006), p. 166; Jacques Fontaine, "King Sisebut's ''Vita Desiderii'' and the Political Function of Visigothic Hagiography." in ''Visigothic Spain'' (1980). ed. [[Edward James (historian)|Edward James]]&lt;/ref&gt; A later life was written by [[Ado of Vienne]].

'''Fourierism''' is the systematic set of economic, political, and social beliefs first espoused by French intellectual [[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837). Based upon a belief in the inevitability of communal associations of people who worked and lived together as part of the human future, Fourier's committed supporters referred to his doctrines as '''Associationism'''. Political contemporaries and subsequent scholarship has identified Fourier's set of ideas as a form of [[utopian socialism]]{{Spaced en dash}}a phrase which retains mild pejorative overtones.

Never tested in practice at any scale in Fourier's lifetime, Fourierism enjoyed a brief boom in the [[United States of America]] during the middle of the 1840s{{Spaced en dash}}owing largely to the efforts of his American popularizer, [[Albert Brisbane]] (1809–1890) and the [[American Union of Associationists]]{{Spaced en dash}}but ultimately failed as a social and economic model. The system was briefly revived in the middle 1850s by [[Victor Prosper Considerant|Victor Considerant]] (1808–1893), a French disciple of Fourier's who [[La Reunion (Dallas)|unsuccessfully attempted to relaunch]] the model in the American state of [[Texas]] in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Beecher, ''Victor Considerant''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
===Passional attraction===

In contrast to the thoroughly [[secular]] communitarianism of his contemporary [[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858), [[Charles Fourier|Charles Fourier's]] thinking starts from a presumption of the existence of God and a divine social order on Earth in accordance with the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Franklin (ed.), "Introduction" to [https://archive.org/details/selectionsfromw00fourgoog ''Selections from the Works of Fourier.''] London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1901; pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier saw himself as a figure of world-historical importance akin to [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) for having identified the fundamental force driving social development, which he called "passional attraction" ''(attraction passionelle).''&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier believed that the structure of the world{{Spaced en dash}}that is the economic, political, and social system{{Spaced en dash}}inhibited humanity from the pursuit of their God-given individual passions, thereby preventing mankind from achieving a state of universal harmony.&lt;ref name=Franklin18&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than seeking to mold individuals to fit the existing form of economic, political, and social life, as had been the traditional goal of the educational and what we today call the [[socialization]] process, Fourier believed that instead the form of economic, political, and social life should itself be altered to fit the inherent passions of the individual, since these economic and social structures were man-made and not God-given.&lt;ref name=Franklin18 /&gt;

Through conscious understanding of this process, which Fourier characterized as "social science," new economic and social formations called "Associations" could be created, structured in such a way as to allow individuals to follow their passions and in this way advance towards the state of universal harmony.&lt;ref name=Franklin18 /&gt;

Always one to list and to systematize, Fourier declared there existed twelve basic passions of humanity grouped around three branches of a "passional tree": "luxurious passions" of the senses; "affective passions" of love, friendship, and parenthood; and the oft-ignored "distributive passions" such as the need for political intrigue, the need for variety, and the pure enthusiasm of spiritual pursuits.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18&gt;Carl J. Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative: Fourierism in Nineteenth-Century America.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991; pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The sum of all these passions Fourier called "unityism," characterized as a universal feeling of benevolence and fraternity.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18 /&gt; Although fettered and mutated by Civilization, the free development of these passions would be allowed in the bright future world, Fourier believed.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18 /&gt;

===Stages of society===

Fourier believed himself the discoverer of the universal laws of societal evolution, theorizing the existence of 32 distinct periods beginning with Edenism and continuing through Savagery, Patriarchate, and Barbarism, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these stages was held to have distinctive material and ideological features, with the treatment afforded to women a particular marker of one stage from the next.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Of far greater concern to Fourier and his disciples was the current 5th form of society, Modern Society, as well as three emerging forms which were believed to be just around the corner: 6 (Guarantism), 7 (Simple Association), and 8 (Compound Association).&lt;ref name=Sears1-2&gt;Charles Sears, [https://archive.org/details/TheNorthAmericanPhalanx ''The North American Phalanx: An Historical and Descriptive Sketch.''] Prescott, WI: John M. Pryse, Publisher, 1886; pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Modern Society," from the Fourierist perspective, was based upon capital and labor and the buying and selling of goods through a network of useless middlemen.&lt;ref name=Sears1&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; With a sneer, Fourier referred to contemporary society as "Civilization," deeming it the cause of fraud, waste, and human unhappiness.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The "isolated family" he deemed inefficient, the wage system demoralizing and exploitative, and organized religion corrupt.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt; An entire book was written detailing 36 types of bankruptcy and 76 sorts of "cuckoldry" to which humanity was subjected by its system of so-called Civilization, which Fourier viewed not only as imperfect but as wholly unacceptable.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt;

Fourier believed that fortunately for humanity, the Civilization of modern society was a fleeting economic formation, soon to vanish from the Earth.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt; The emerging socio-economic structure of "Guarantism" would be based upon the fundamental principle of universal insurance, Fourier believed, which was to include guarantee of the security of capital and guarantee on the right of labor to gainful employment.&lt;ref name=Sears1-2 /&gt; Petty traders and speculative profiteers would be eliminated from the economy in this new system of organized production and distribution, it was believed.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt;

The next stage in the Fourierist schema, that of "Simple Association," was to be based upon the cooperative enterprise of like bodies of farmers or artisans or industrial workers as distinct groups.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; Farmers would associate with other farmers, artisans with other artisans, industrial producers with other industrial producers, producing and selling their goods collectively.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; Simultaneously, these economic organizations were to for the first time include the association of family living and domestic labor,&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; thereby eliminating the economic waste and social isolation of individual living. [[Wage labour|Wage labor]] would be eliminated, as the members of each of these associations would be co-proprietors, producing in tandem and sharing alike in the proceeds of their efforts.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt;

Subsequently, the Fourierists believed, there would emerge "Compound Association" or "Harmonism." Under Compound Association all pursuits – industrial producers and artisans and farmers alike – would join in large associations which would shatter all economic lines.&lt;ref name=Sears2&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; One Fourierian enthusiast described the system of Compound Association in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every interest is provided for, by an organization which embraces all details of production and distribution; and a system of natural and integral education is instituted – that is, a complete system of physical, mental, and emotional development, intimately connected with daily pursuits, provided for; that art and the science which underlies art may be taught together; that theory and practice may go hand in hand and that the individual may have the command of his whole personal power and enjoy the conditions of expressing it.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Every individual in these Compound Associations would be free to take part in the labor of a dozen or more different work groups, according to their interests and pleasure, over the course of any year, in the Fourierist vision.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; That which the [[Marxism|Marxists]] called [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation of labor]] would thereby be eliminated and production boosted, since "a man having himself on his own side works with more force, greater skill, and better effect than one who works against his inclinations," in the words of one Fourierian.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;

===Economics===

Fourier believed that economic output was the product of three factors: labor, capital, and talent.&lt;ref name=Franklin20&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these, he argued, were important to production and each needed to be compensated as such for the general prosperity of the organized association to be preserved.&lt;ref name=Franklin20 /&gt; The communal associations which emerged based upon Fourier's ideas were generally formed as [[joint stock companies]], and their investor-members were compensated separately on the basis both of amount of capital invested and amount of labor performed – with labor time given a range of values based both on the necessity and difficulty of the work and the degree of talent and skill with which it was performed.

===Social life===
[[File:Phalanstère.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Elevated view of a Fourierist ''Phalanstère'' from the works of Victor Considerant.]]

Fourier's prescription was the establishment of communities called Phalanxes or Associations in the countryside. Housed inside gigantic serpentine edifices called "phalanstries" would be 1620 people, coming from various occupations and social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; These residents were to be arranged in occupational "series," according to Fourier's model – major divisions such as between agrarians and industrial producers and artisans – which would be further divided into smaller "groups" to cooperatively conduct specific aspects of the work.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Mobility of the individual between various groups and even sections according to personal desires was to be allowed.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt;

Fundamental to the Fourierian ideal was the notion of collective living and the rational performance of domestic duties. Individual households were seen as both wasteful in terms of duplicated effort performed and isolating of individuals – standing in the way of true cooperation and social harmony.

Remaining in unpublished manuscript form until 1967 would be Fourier's imaginative predictions about degrees of sexual promiscuity and the institutions and moral codes which would emerge to govern love and interpersonal relationships in the harmonious world of Compound Association.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt;

===Role of force===

The Fourierian system of associations was based on the notion of voluntary participation and expansion through the force of example. Once founded, associations would demonstrate their practical merits and inspire emulation, with the first model communities replicating and spreading from localities to regions to nations and internationally. Never in his writings does Fourier appeal for the use of governmental legislation or coercive power of any sort, instead believing association to be a natural and wholly voluntary structure,&lt;ref name=Franklin21&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; part of a Divine Social Code.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;

Moreover, the achievement on an international scale would eliminate war from the face of the earth.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; Instead, industrial armies would be formed to engage in gigantic reclamation projects, irrigating deserts and restoring vegetation and draining marshes and putting the land to cultivation.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; The elimination of disease would follow, as such banes as [[cholera]], [[typhus]], and [[yellow fever]] would vanish with the unhealthful places from whence they originated before society's restorative efforts.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; Through the planting of vast swaths of timber, cropland would be protected and the earth's climate itself would be slowly transformed, Fourier and his followers believed.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fantastic theories===

Fourier's theoretical system, described by one scholar as "vast and eccentric,"&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; was only a part of the output of what another called "a most riotous and unpruned imagination."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Gray to the Aberdeen Philosophical Society, March 15, 1923. Quoted in "The Chaos and Sense of Fourier," ''Aberdeen Journal,'' March 16, 1923, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier believed that in the new world people would live for 144 years, that new species of friendly and pacifistic animals such as "anti-lions" would emerge, and that over time human beings would develop long and useful tails.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; Fourier also professed a belief in the ability of [[Metempsychosis|human souls to migrate]] between physical and "aromal" worlds.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; Such thinking was set aside during the last 15 years of Fourier's life, when he instead began to concentrate on testing in practice his economic and social ideas.&lt;ref name=Guarneri20&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier's disciples, including in the first rank the American Albert Brisbane and the French Victor Considerant, later pared down Fourier's writings into a comprehensible system for economic and social organization, with the Fourierist movement experiencing a brief [[boom and bust|boom]] in the United States during the middle years of the 1840s, when some 30 Fourierist associations were established.&lt;ref&gt;William Alfred Hinds, ''American Communities.'' Second edition. Chicago, IL: Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., 1908; pg. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on new religious movements ===
The Fourierist doctrine of attractions, correspondences, and analogies was identified with esoteric doctrines like [[Martinism]] by Fourierist like Just Muiron from an early point on.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, ''Sozialismus'', pp. 122-127; Beecher, ''Charles Fourier'', pp. 160-167.&lt;/ref&gt; It is no wonder, then, that contemporary observers like Louis Reybaud, the author of the first study of the socialists, perceived Fourierism and other [[Utopian socialism|early socialist schools]] in the context of mysticism, magic, kabbalah, or the occult sciences.&lt;ref&gt;''Strube, Sozialismus, pp. 105-115.''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it has been shown that Fourierism exerted a decisive influence on new religious movements like [[Spiritualism]] or [[Occultism]] after 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, "Socialist Religion"; cf. Strube, ''Sozialismus'' and Monroe, ''Laboratories''.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this date, Fourierism had already coined the ideas of US-American spiritualist thinkers such as [[Andrew Jackson Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;Albanese, ''Republic'', pp. 171-176, 208-218.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi]], who is regarded as the founder of modern occultism, was a pronounced adherent of Fourierism in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;''Strube, Sozialismus, pp. 316-351.''&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early twentieth century, there was a strong Fourierist presence in French socialist-spiritualist circles.

[[Thomas Adolphus Trollope]] wrote a summary of his biography, which had been extracted were published by a Giuseppe Beraldi in a series called ''Memorie di religione, di morale, e di letteratura''. Francesco's paternal family was from Pistoia originally; his father had been a secretary to Cardinal [[Fabrizio Paolucci|Paolucci]]. Francesco was dispatched to be educated by the [[Jesuits]] at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University|Collegio Romano]], though he never took vows as a priest. He was employed as secretary for various diplomats in Rome. However, in 1773, he lost important backers when the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Suppression of the Jesuits]] was declared by Pope [[Clement XIV]].

In 1775, Cancellieri was appointed librarian for Cardinal [[Leonardo Antonelli|Antonelli]], whose library was located in the [[Palazzo Pamphili]] in [[Piazza Navona]]; this post Cancellieri held till the latter's death in 1811. He lived on No. 63, Via del Mascherone, in a small house adjacent to the church of [[San Petronio dei Bolognesi]]. In addition to librarian position, Cancellieri was also Superintendent of the Propaganda printing press, and for a time, Prosigillatore for the Vatican, (Deputy Sealer of Briefs). But the income from these positions was paltry, and for years he was close to insolvency, specially after his protector, Antonelli, died. His publications rarely brought in income, and were often sponsored by those to whom they were dedicated.

In his position as secretary, Cancellieri proved prolific, writing nearly three hundred treatises or books. He was equally a prodigious epistolarian, he sent over 300 letters alone to the historian [[Girolamo Tiraboschi|Tiraboschi]]. He was amiable and neat in person and language, but never terse; and his style in manners and writing were bountifully steeped with gushingly effusive, but also often grating, cordialities. The poet [[Giacomo Leopardi|Leopardi]] complained that: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Cancellieri is insufferable from the outrageous laudations with which he overwhelms everybody who goes to see him, ... (and) which renders his conversation utterly uninteresting, since one cannot believe a word of it." He also said: "Cancellieri—an old fool, a river of chatter, the most tiresome and insupportable bore on earth. He speaks of absolutely trivial matters with the utmost interest, and of things of high import with the coldest indifference. He smothers you with compliments, and utters them with such a cold indifference that to hear him one would think that it must be the most ordinary thing in the world to be an extraordinary man.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leopardi in part shows impatience with the overcourteous past, dense with etiquette and flowery witticism, but also his attachment to minutiae unnerved the poet. Trollope states: &lt;blockquote&gt;''The old 18th century bookworm, whose mind, filled to overflowing with odds and ends of archaeological learning ...could never conceive, that his stores could be otherwise than profoundly interesting to all mankind, must necessarily have seemed an unprofitable cumberer of the earth to the young poet, whose brain was busy with meditations on the eternal destinies of man. The gentle old-world courtesies in 'issimo,' ... nauseated the younger man, whose provincial breeding had not taught him to understand that there was no more real insincerity in his aged host's compliments than in the obeisances of a minuet. ... But it may be affirmed, with the most perfect assurance, that Cancellieri's intention and object at the interview was to please and gratify his visitor, whereas the morbid, melancholy, discontented mind of the poet was wholly occupied by his own sensations. ''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
His books reflect his style; and, speak generally on the traditions of papal Rome, but also he took time to comment on [[Tarantism]] and claims surrounding the origins and actions of [[Christopher Columbus]], about the Catholic liturgy, the sacred and ancient topography of Rome and its surroundings. He wrote about ancient Roman [[pignora Imperii]] as well as about the events of Holy week at given chapels. His titles meander as much as his focus inside the books. His essays begin with short islands of statements, but rapidly these are surrounded by an ocean of footnotes, an erudite diluvium of quotations and citations, resembling the style of the modern novel ''[[The Mezzanine]]'' by [[Nicholson Baker]]. The arabesque embroidering of his [[Rococo]] eloquence was soon to clash with the terse artillery of the post-Napoleonic speech. Cancillieri was like [[François Boucher|Boucher]] in grammar, but the world had turned direct and crisp like [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Cancillieri was educated and focused on the courtly atmosphere and world of the Roman Curia, replete with genuflection, cult, and ritual; and all this was nearly dissipated by the uncompromising grapeshot of post-Revolutionary Napoleonic France.

His memoirs includes the events of 1804, Napoleon forced [[Pope Pius VII]] to witness his [[Coronation of Napoleon I|crowning]] as emperor, a ceremony meant to recall, although differing in details, the crowning of [[Charlemagne]] as Holy Roman Emperor in the year 800. Cancellieri and Cardinal Antonelli, accompanied the papal entourage of carriages which took 22 days in November to reach Fontainbleau. Known as the ''Bel'Abate'', it would not be surprising if he is one of the two courtiers behind the pope, one holding the infamous [[Napoleon tiara]], in the painting on the [[The Coronation of Napoleon|''Coronation of Napoleon'']] by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]. Cancellieri describes with great minuteness all the gorgeous ceremony. He accompanied the Pope on his visit to the Louvre, by then replete with looted works.

== Works ==
The manuscripts of Francesco Cancellieri, includes many volumes unpublished and conserved since 1840 in the [[Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vat. lat.'' nn. 9155-9205, 9672-9711, 9728-9733, 10323-10324, 12924, pp. 188-351)&lt;/ref&gt; Other manuscripts are in the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma]] (Mss. vari, nn. 902-913).

'''Giovanni Francesco Abela''' (1582–1655) was a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] of noble birth who in the early 17th century wrote an important work on Malta, ''Della Descrittione di Malta isola nel Mare Siciliano: con le sue antichità, ed altre notizie'', "description of Malta, island in the Sicilian sea, with its antiquities, and other information".

Abela was born in [[Valletta]] to Marco Abela and Benarda Vella&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ciantar|first=Giovannantonio|date=1772|title=Malta illustrata|volume=1-2|publisher=Stamperia del Palazzo di S.A.S. MDCCLXXII, by Giovanni Mallia|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=OClXAAAAcAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP12&amp;dq=Palazzo+Carafa+Malta&amp;ots=DskWkwB48b&amp;sig=9lcppd0RfbjDX9jU3Cu414Sc_HU&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=vij}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose great great grandfather was Barone di Pietra Lunga and whose ancestors ruled Malta on more than one occasion and were part of the royal family of Spain.

Malta illustrated is still an important source of first-hand information on a number of subjects of Melitensia, such as folklore, placenames, the [[Maltese language]], [[history of Malta]] and archaeology. His description of the Maltese Islands was translated into Latin by G.A. Seinero in 1725, Latin being the universal language of science and culture of that time. This translation was incorporated in [[Johann Georg Graevius]] Thesaurus antiquitatum et historiarum Italiae. 
            
He became Auditor of Grand Master [[Antoine de Paule]], Chaplain and finally Vice Chancellor of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. He is also remembered as the promoter of the first Notarial Archives for Malta.

Gian Francesco Abela visited archaeological sites on the islands and made some valuable observations. He appears to have been the first to note that the ancient temple of [[Hercules]] was to be identified with the remains on the hill at Tas-Silg rather than those of Borg in-Nadur. At Tas-Silg he observed foundations and courses of stones ‘ben lavorate e messe insieme,’ and in support of his identification he recorded the discovery of ‘medaglie, pezzi di statue d’idoletti, e d’altre cose, minimi avanzi di quella vana gentilità e falsa religione, quivi ritrovate sotto il Magistero del Principe Wignacourt, mentre alcuni nell’istesso luogo cavando, scioccamente pensavano far acquisto di ricco tesoro.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abela|first1=Giovanni Francesco|authorlink1=Giovanni Francesco Abela|title=Della Descrizione di Malta Isola nel Mare Siciliano con le sue Antichità, ed Altre Notizie|date=1647|publisher=Paolo Bonacota|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krRTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 17th century Abela converted his house at [[Marsa, Malta|Marsa]] to a historical museum, the first on Malta. Many of its artefacts are now stored in Malta's [[National Museum of Archaeology, Malta|National Museum of Archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsalocalcouncil.com/default.aspx?MLEV=0&amp;MDIS=257 Marsa Local Council - Town at a Crossroad: History of Marsa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714041438/http://www.marsalocalcouncil.com/default.aspx?MLEV=0&amp;MDIS=257 |date=2011-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in the Chapel of Our Lady of Philermos (today the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament) in the Co-Cathedral of St. John in [[Valletta]]. The [[Gan Frangisk Abela Junior College|Junior College]] in [[Msida]] is named after Abela.

The '''Glasgow School''' was a circle of influential artists and designers that began to coalesce in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] in the 1870s, and flourished from the 1890s to around 1910. Representative groups included '''The Four''' (also known as the '''Spook School'''), the '''Glasgow Girls'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Glasgow Girls: women in art and design, 1880-1920|publisher=Canongate|year=2001|isbn=9781841951515|editor-last=Burkhauser|editor-first=Jude|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Glasgow Boys'''.&lt;ref&gt;Rezelman, Cogger. The Glasgow Boys.&lt;/ref&gt; They were responsible for creating the distinctive '''Glasgow Style'''.

Glasgow experienced an [[Boom and bust|economic boom]] at the end of the 19th century, resulting in an increase in distinctive contributions to the [[Art Nouveau]] movement, particularly in the fields of [[architecture]], [[interior design]] and [[painting]].

==The Four (Spook School)==
[[File:Wfm glasgow school of art.jpg|thumb|right|Glasgow School of Art]]
Among the most prominent definers of the Glasgow School  collective were The Four. They were the [[Painting|painter]] and [[Studio glass|glass artist]] [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]], acclaimed [[architect]] [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (MacDonald's husband), MacDonald's sister [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] and [[Herbert MacNair]]. Together, The Four defined the Glasgow Style's fusion of influences including the [[Celtic Revival]], the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental [[Europe]]. The Four, otherwise known as the Spook School, ultimately made a significant impact on the definition of [[Art Nouveau]]. The name, Spook School, or Spooky or Ghoul School,  was originally a "derisive epithet" given to their work which "distorted and conventionalized human... form."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Glasgow Girls: Women in Art and Design 1880-1920|last = Burkhauser|first = Jude|publisher = Canongate Press|year = 1993|isbn = 0963698508|location = Edinburgh|pages = 55-104|chapter = The Glasgow Style}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Glasgow Girls==
The Glasgow Girls is the name now used for a group of female designers and [[women artists|artists]] including Margaret and Frances MacDonald, both of whom were members of The Four, [[Jessie M. King]], [[Annie French]], [[Helen Paxton Brown]], [[Jessie Wylie Newbery]], [[Ann Macbeth]], [[Bessie MacNicol]], [[Norah Neilson Gray]],&lt;ref name=show&gt;[http://www.helensburgh-heritage.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=777:glasgow-girls-work-on-show&amp;catid=101:headlines&amp;Itemid=539 Glasgow Girls On Display], Mary Selwood, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stansmore Dean Stevenson|Stansmore Dean]], [[Eleanor Allen Moore]], [[De Courcy Lewthwaite Dewar]], the silversmith Agnes Banks Harvey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nbr0x|title=Series 35, Antiques Roadshow - BBC One|website=BBC|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christian Jane Fergusson]]. May Wilson and Eliza Bell, among others, continued the tradition of ceramic artistry into the 1940s and 1950s by hand painting various items with floral patterns.

Women were able to flourish in Glasgow during a "period of enlightenment" that took place between 1885 and 1920, where women were actively pursuing art careers and the [[Glasgow School of Art]] had a significant period of "international visibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Glasgow Girls: Women in Art and Design 1880-1920|last = Burkhauser|first = Jude|publisher = Canongate Press, Plc|year = 1993|isbn = 0963698508|location = Edinburgh|pages = 19–26|chapter = Restored to a Place of Honour}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes attributed to the "influential" and "progressive"&lt;ref name=times/&gt; head of the art school, [[Fra Newbery]], who established an environment in which women could flourish, both as students and as teachers.&lt;ref name=tanner&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/73660|title=Glasgow Girls (act. 1880–1920) - Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|website=Oxforddnb.com|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women benefited from the new [[Glasgow Society of Lady Artists]] (founded 1882) which offered a place for women artists to meet and also had exhibition space.&lt;ref name=tanner/&gt; In addition, many art school students and staff were  involved in [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Glasgow Girls: Women in Art and Design 1880-1920 |publisher = Canongate Press, Plc|year = 1993|isbn = 0963698508|location = Edinburgh|pages = 43-54|editor-last = Burkhauser|editor-first = Jude|chapter = The 'New Woman' in the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Students took turns between classes stitching up banners" for the movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The name "Glasgow Girls" emerged much later. In the 1960s there was an attempt to give due attention to the work of the city’s women artists to balance the plentiful discussion of the Glasgow Boys.&lt;ref name=tanner/&gt; It is thought that the then head of the [[Scottish Arts Council]] William Buchanan was the first to use the name in the catalogue for a 1968 Glasgow Boys exhibition.&lt;ref name=tanner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The+Glasgow+Girls|title=ExploreArt -  Search Results - The Glasgow Girls|website=Exploreart.co.uk|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Glasgow Boys: An Exhibition of Work by the Group of Artists who Flourished in Glasgow 1880-1900'', Volume 2, Scottish Arts Council, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  This "invention"&lt;ref name=times&gt;Andrew Gibbbon Williams, 'Engendering respect', The Times (features), 18 Sep 1990&lt;/ref&gt; has been called an "ironic reference" to the equivalent men’s grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org./stable/1358454|title= 'Review of "Glasgow Girls": Women in Art and Design 1880-1920' |author=Lynne Walker|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=14.2|date=1993|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Glasgow Girls was emphasised by a major exhibition ''Glasgow Girls: Women in Art and Design 1880-1920'' organised by [[Jude Burkhauser]] in 1990.

==The Glasgow Boys==
Through the 1880s and 1890s, around the same time that the Spook School was gaining prominence, a collective which came to be known as the Glasgow Boys was interpreting and expanding the [[wiktionary:canon|canon]] of [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] and [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionist]] painting. Their subject matter featured [[rural]], prosaic scenes from in and around Glasgow. Their colorful depictions attempted to capture the many facets of the character of [[Scotland]].

The Glasgow Boys consisted of several men, most of whom were trained in, or had strong ties to the city of Glasgow. These men were brought together by a passion for realism and naturalism and this showed through in the pieces they produced. Along with this passion for naturalism, they shared a marked distaste for the Edinburgh oriented Scottish art establishment, which they viewed as oppressive. Driven and motivated by these ideals they embraced change, created masterpieces, and became Scottish icons in the process.

Among the painters associated with the group were [[Joseph Crawhall]] (1861–1913), [[Thomas Millie Dow]] (1848-1919), [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]] (1859–1930), [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] (1858–1943), [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]] (1864–1933), [[James Whitelaw Hamilton]] (1860-1932) and [[E. A. Walton]] (1860–1922). [[David Gauld]] (1865–1936), [[William Kennedy (painter)|William Kennedy]] (1859–1918), [[John Lavery]] (1856–1941), [[Harrington Mann]] (1864-1937), [[Stuart Park]] (1862–1933), [[William Wells (painter)|William Wells]] (1872–1923), [[David Young Cameron]] (1865–1945), [[Alexander Ignatius Roche]] (1861–1923), [[Arthur Melville]] (1855–1904), [[Thomas Corsan Morton]] (1859-1928), [[James Nairn]] (1859–1904), [[George Pirie (artist)|George Pirie]] (1863-1946)  and [[John Quinton Pringle]] (1864–1925). [[James Paterson (painter)|James Paterson]] (1854–1932) and [[William York Macgregor]] (1855-1923) were leading figures in the group, which used to meet at Macgregor's studio.

Their main influences were that of Japanese print, French Realism including [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]], and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], but all of their experiences around the world greatly impacted on and inspired their work, in particular in Spain, North Africa, and Japan. The group was constantly influenced by what they saw in the world around them and strove to display these images by utilizing the techniques of realism and naturalism; they had a passion to depict things as they actually are. This is one of the reasons that the group often chose to work outdoors. Working outdoors allowed them to produce paintings that were as true to nature as possible and it allowed them to paint realistic objects in their natural environment. They painted real people in real places. The production of naturalistic paintings was new to this time period, and thus their techniques were considered to be innovative. Similarly, the pieces often created a sense of movement, an accurate (or naturalistic) depiction of light and shade, and extremely realistic texture. This made them stand out in the art community.

===Collections and exhibitions===
A large collection of work from the Glasgow Boys is held in the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], where one room is dedicated to the group. The museum houses more than 60 of the Boys' pieces that were created between 1880 and 1900, arguably the time period in which their best, and most innovative, pieces were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-15385117|title=New Glasgow Boys gallery to open|date=20 October 2011|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More of their works can be found on display at the [[Burrell Collection]], [[Broughton House]], [[Paisley Museum and Art Galleries]] and the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery]].

A '''glyptotheque''' is a collection of [[sculptures]]. It is part of the name of several museums and art galleries. 

The designation glyptotheque was coined by the librarian of King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]], derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] verb ''glyphein'' (γλύφειν), meaning "cut into stone." It was an allusion to the word [[pinacotheca]] (from πίναξ ''[[pinax]]'', "panel" or "painting"). ''Glypton'' (γλυπτόν) is the Greek word for a sculpture.

Museums that today bear this name or [[cognate]]s of it include:

* [[Glyptothek]], in Munich, Germany
* [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], in Copenhagen, Denmark
* [[National Glyptotheque]], in Athens, Greece
* [[Gliptoteka]], in Zagreb, Croatia

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41949">[[File:Bison bison 2003 map.svg|thumb|px=700|Distribution of wood and plains bison populations in North America. 2003]]
Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[plains bison]] and [[wood bison]] populations were hunted by nomadic indigenous hunters and white hunters alike. By the 1850s, the bison was nearly [[extinct]], spurring a movement to save the few herds that remained. Federal government wildlife policy evolved from preservation of wilderness to utilitarian, scientific conservation and management of bison populations. The goals of these policies often contradicted themselves, aiming to simultaneously preserve wildlife, promote recreation, commercialize the bison, and assert state control over [[indigenous peoples in Canada|Aboriginal Canadians]]. Bison conservation efforts were shaped by the federal government's colonialist and modernist approach to Canada's north, the management of [[National parks of Canada|national parks]] and reserves, and the influence of scientific knowledge.

Government preservation efforts began with the passing of the Unorganized Territories Game Preservation Act of 1894, which restricted legal hunting to certain times of the year. Bison herds were tracked down and moved to reserves where hunters were banned from operating.

In 1909, [[Buffalo National Park]] in [[Alberta]] was established with a herd of 300 plains bison. By 1916 more than 2,000 bison lived in the park, which was now overpopulated. As a result, many were moved to [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] in north-eastern Alberta (est. 1922). There, the plains bison and wood bison mingled and created a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridized]] species of bison. The plains bison also brought new diseases which infected the existing wood bison population.

When bison populations collapsed in the mid-19th century, Aboriginal groups that relied on the bison had to find new ways to support themselves. In the 20th century, the Canadian government's conservationist policies that restricted hunting and requisitioned land to turn into national parks made it even more difficult for Aboriginals to remain self-sufficient. Ultimately, it was not as difficult for Aboriginal groups to maintain self-sufficiency compared to the alternative of continuing their hunting practices, as Canadian bison would go extinct.

Efforts to conserve the bison are ongoing. Parks Canada has plans to reintroduce the plains bison to Banff National Park in order to restore the species and to promote tourism. The commercial bison industry still breeds bison for food in direct conflict with wild bison conservation efforts. Approximately 400,000 bison live in North America today; only 20,000 of those are considered wild. Many believe that conservation efforts must go beyond simply increasing population size and focus on the restoration of the bison to its wild, undomesticated state.

==Historical decline of the North American bison population==
[[File:American bison k5680-1 edit.jpg|thumb|American plains bison]]

===Plains bison===
In the early 1800s, there were an estimated 30 million bison on the Great Plains.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001, 25&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lucrative robe trade accelerated overhunting of the [[plains bison]] by indigenous groups and white settlers alike. The bison on the western plains were last to be affected by white American expansionism, but by the 1850s even those herds were diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001, 112&lt;/ref&gt; Westward migration of domesticated animals and people destroyed grazing grounds, and drought and new diseases exacerbated the decline.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The plight of the bison was largely seen as the superiority of man over nature until the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001, 165&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Andrew Isenberg argues that the rise of capitalist ideology drove indigenous and white hunters alike to compete for every last animal, and that a multitude of factors – disease, drought, westward expansion, commercialization and industrialization of hunting, colonialism, and the introduction of domestic animals from Europe – caused the near-extinction of the bison.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001, 197-198&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that the bison depletion was a problem of the [[tragedy of the commons]], the opposite of capitalism: The bison were communal property, not private property, therefore they were abused and squandered for short-term gain that ultimately caused long-term problems as no one person or group was responsible for maintaining a healthy population.&lt;ref&gt;'''Center for Private Conservation'''&lt;br/&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAXcvnNqYeM Tragedy of the Commons]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wood bison===
Today, the majority of the world's [[wood bison]] herds are located in Northern Canada: a small herd of bison discovered in the northern part of [[Wood Buffalo National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Gates and Larter 1990, 231&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, 23 of these bison were relocated to the south side of [[Elk Island National Park]] and 300 remain there today as the most genetically pure wood bison remaining. While there are many factors that have contributed to the decline of the wood bison, the most prominent are the over-hunting that took place in the 1800s, inadequate conservation methods that led to hybridization with the plains bison and other species, and the spread of communicable diseases. Wood bison were largely over-hunted in the 1800s, and only a few hundred remained in Northern Alberta by the early 20th century. By 1957, wood bison were thought to have been finally extinct in Canada due to hybridization with the plains bison, which took place in Wood Buffalo National Park between 1925 and 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Gates and Larter 1990, 231-238&lt;/ref&gt; As wood bison species became threatened with the hybridization, relocation and breeding conservation programs specific to wood bison were established in 1963, and the population increased steadily. From the 1970s to the 90s, however, the population began to decline again with the spread of [[bovine tuberculosis]] which resulted from the transfer of infected plains bison to Wood Buffalo National Park. In the case of Wood Buffalo National Park, the number of wood bison declined from 10,000 bison in the late 1960s to 2,200 bison by the late 1990s due to this process.&lt;ref&gt;Joly and Messier 2005, 543-551&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the wood bison in North America is largely one of repeated human mistakes that resulted in critical endagerment of an iconic species.

===Social ecology===
Aboriginal worldviews emphasize a connection between all life forms. Aboriginals had a reciprocal, sustainable relationship with the bison. Traditional governing structures ensured the continuity of resource use over time, allowing Aboriginals to adapt to frequent, unpredictable changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, northern Aboriginals had a subsistence culture based on local hunting and trapping economies. The traditional hunting cultures of the [[Cree]], [[Dene]], and [[Inuit]] peoples came into direct conflict with the Canadian federal government's wildlife conservation programs, as life on the land was impossible without access to animals.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboriginals of the Great Plains faced a choice in the 1700s: they could remain in their villages, cultivating food and trying to defend themselves against diseases brought over from Europe, or they could adapt to the white colonial economy and become nomadic bison hunters, selling bison robes, tongues and other parts in exchange for commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001, 121&lt;/ref&gt; Many chose the latter option and, for decades, profited from the bison trade. By the 1850s, however, the near-extinction of the bison had removed their livelihood, and many of these groups starved to death.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift in hunting practices===
After the introduction of horses, newly nomadic First Nations groups could now lance or shoot bison, speeding up the rate of the bison hunt.&lt;ref&gt;Records 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The bison hunt became highly commercialized and capitalistic, valuing quick profits over long-term sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Isenberg argues that cultural and ecological interactions between Native Americans and Euroamericans in the Great Plains were responsible for the near-extinction of the bison.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural and ecological interactions created new forms of bison hunters: mounted Indian nomads and Euroamerican industrial hideman.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001&lt;/ref&gt; These hunters, combined with environmental pressures, nearly extinguished the bison.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Isenberg also explains that the introduction of horses facilitated bison hunting and competed with bison for scarce water and forage.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Industrialization]] also played a role, with the expansion of railroads, commercial hunting, and the fur trade market.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for preservation efforts===
The first bison preservation efforts in Canada included the Unorganized Territories Game Preservation Act of 1894, through which the government legislated a [[Hunting season#Closed season|closed season]] on the bison.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2002, 94&lt;/ref&gt; This act was passed after naturalists conducted rough and largely inaccurate visual surveys of the bison population, concluding that the animal was in decline. From this assumption naturalists were able to create a more active federal wildlife administration in the Northwest Territories.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2002, 94&lt;/ref&gt; The Wood Buffalo National Park was created in 1922 in response to Northern Canada's wildlife crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2002, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of wildlife conservation in Canada==

===Ideological development of the wildlife conservation movement===
[[File:Banff National Park.jpg|thumb|The [[Rocky Mountains Park Act]] in 1887 was modelled on the Yellowstone Park Act passed by the United States Congress in 1881.]]
Wildlife preservation was not a priority for the federal government during the 19th century due to belief in the superabundance of natural resources, the presence of a wilderness frontier, and a political climate that emphasized development and exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1998, 4&lt;/ref&gt; The bison was the iconic species of the North American conservation movement, an animal that symbolized frontier wilderness and the disappearing wild.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 122&lt;/ref&gt; This idea motivated the conservation efforts in Canada, in addition to the concerns for recreation and resource preservation, as well as the influence of American wildlife conservation on Canadian civil servants.

Wildlife conservation in Canada was sparked by the protection of animals for tourism and recreation. Howard Douglas, an appointed superintendent of [[Banff National Park|Rocky Mountains Park]] in 1897 first began to expand and preserve wildlife to attract more visitors to the park.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1998, 55&lt;/ref&gt; However, between 1900 and 1920 Canada saw a dramatic change in national attitudes from focus in tourism to the creation of the National Parks Branch, world's first governmental organization dedicated to parks, and the development of other governmental organizations like the Commission of Conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1998, 200&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian Commission of Conservation that established in 1909 was intended to be an independent body dealing with questions of natural resource conservation in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1998, 40&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the Commission, wildlife investigations were mostly focused on resource-commodity species such as fish and fur-bearing animals and later developed to include greater variety of species.

Although the efforts to preserve wildlife for tourism and as resources sparked the conservation movement, the true ideological development began with the institutionalization of environmental protection, which was brought forth through a number of dedicated government bureaucrats such as Robert Campbell, a Canadian Forestry Branch Director, Gordon Hewitt, a Dominion entomologist, and [[James Harkin]], the first Parks Commissioner expressing strong conservationist philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1998, 14&lt;/ref&gt; These bureaucrats actively sought administrative support from the government and intensively engaged in their own research to pass numerous environmental protection policies.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1998, 130&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the efforts of Canadian government officials, the wildlife conservation movement became institutionalized and solidified. While personal experiences and encounters with environmental threats account for the efforts of these civil servants, the influence of American experience was a strong factor: the loss of the frontier, the impact of civilization with its resulting decline in wildlife numbers, and the establishment and success of American national parks.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1998, 14&lt;/ref&gt; James Harkin was especially influenced by the American preservationist [[John Muir]] and his wilderness preservation theories, while both Harkin and Douglas were well aware of the developments in American wildlife protection movements.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1998, 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian society and government experienced a greater awareness and sense of responsibility that led to the development of a wilderness consciousness and preservation ethic. Wildlife began to be protected as an intrinsically valuable international resource rather than a simple tourist attraction or a commodity. Canada's history of wildlife conservation movement demonstrates how a small faction of dedicated civil servants transformed their own goals of preserving endangered species into active government policy.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1998, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of federal government wildlife policy in Canada==

===From preservation to conservation===
Preservation was the main focus of management up to [[World War II]], which was accomplished by "feeding the bison, shooting carnivores that preyed on them, and patrolling for poachers."&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 139&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as the 1870s, western ranchers James McKay and William Alloway were capturing bison calves and raising them alongside their herds of cattle, effectively domesticating the bison.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001, 175-176&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these bison were sold in 1880 to Colonel Samuel Bedson, who let them roam the grounds of the Stony Mountain penitentiary in Manitoba.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001, 176&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1907, the federal government purchased Michel Pablo's herd of plains bison from [[Montana]] and transferred it to Buffalo National Park in Alberta as a response to the declining number of bison in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 139&lt;/ref&gt;  The species was nearly extinct at this point and the park served as an ideal environment in which their numbers could and did grow.

In the post-war period, wildlife scientists began to recognize that the bison in the north could be exploited for national benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 143&lt;/ref&gt;  Wildlife and the wilderness were reconceptualized as factors that could be manipulated to increase economic development in the north.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 143&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947, the [[Dominion Wildlife Service]] (Later known as [[Canadian Wildlife Service]] or CWS) was created to centralize wildlife research infrastructure within the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2002, 110&lt;/ref&gt;  The manipulation of the bison was justified by Canadian Wildlife Service biologist William Fuller in a study that demonstrated that the tuberculosis found among the hybridized bison in the north helped maintain stable numbers in the park.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 140&lt;/ref&gt;  Slaughter became more systematic and frequent among the bison through the management plan in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals===
Through the Unorganized Territories Game Preservation Act of 1894, the federal government enforced a closed season on the bison.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2002, 94&lt;/ref&gt; The plains bison were near extinction in Canada and with these efforts the government hoped to preserve them from the Aboriginal hunters. However, preservation efforts were not only for recreational purposes. After the Second World War, the bison were used for commercial purposes as well. As the numbers of bison increased, the federal government issued licenses to regulate the number of bison and bring in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal people were excluded from national parks, not for the sake of preserving wilderness, but in the "interests of game conservation, sport hunting, tourism, and Indian assimilation."&lt;ref&gt;Binnema and Niemi 2006, 724&lt;/ref&gt; This represented a shift in federal wildlife policy goals from preservation of wilderness to the commercialization and commodification of the national parks. Aboriginals were excluded from [[Banff National Park]] in Alberta to serve the goals of conservationists and sportsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Binnema and Niemi 2006, 738&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Aboriginal hunting practices conflicted with the goals of the [[Department of Indian Affairs]] to civilize and assimilate Aboriginal people.&lt;ref&gt;Binnema and Niemi 2006, 738&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1880s, Aboriginals were encouraged to abandon hunting in favour of an agricultural lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Binnema and Niemi 2006, 738&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the goal of the federal government was not to restore and protect wilderness, but to create an environment with an abundance of wildlife attractions for sports hunting and tourism, and to assimilate Aboriginal people into Euro-Canadian society.

===Contradictions in policies===
The preservation of the wood bison in northern Canada was implied by the strict federal control of traditional Aboriginal hunting practices through the creation of a wildlife sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 25&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government proposed large scale ranching and breeding plans for bison herds.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Preservationist approaches to the bison in the north implied the assertion of federal power over the bison which had been under the control of Aboriginal hunters for generations.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 26&lt;/ref&gt; There was no role for the human use of nature.

In 1952 and 1954, there was a shortage of mature adult male bison which resulted in the slaughtering of more female and young bison and caused conflict within the management.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 147&lt;/ref&gt; CWS biologist Nick Novakowsi argued that the bison was declining due to slaughtering along with the effects of flooding.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 147&lt;/ref&gt; This created conflict between the management at the Wood Buffalo Park and the federal government. The park management did not see this as reducing the bison herd for stabilization, but instead described it as "mass murder."&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 147&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government's goal of commercializing the bison throughout Canada undermined the need to provide inexpensive bison meat to the local population in northern Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 95&lt;/ref&gt; With new agreements with meatpackers in the south, combined with their prior commitment to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and Indian Affairs, over nine hundred bison were slaughtered.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 96&lt;/ref&gt; Through the agreement, the packing companies received top quality bison meat for low prices, while northern Canada got tough meat that was sold at higher prices.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 96&lt;/ref&gt; CWS biologists feared that there was no scientific legitimacy to the slaughtering of the nine hundred bison, many which did not have tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 98&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1957- 1958, the testing and slaughtering program of the bison was established.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 98&lt;/ref&gt; The conservation and commodification of bison are fundamentally contradictory goals.

In the late 1980s, there was a debate on the outbreak of tuberculosis and brucellosis at Wood Buffalo Park discussing whether the diseased bison should be replaced. A committee was established in 1986 to discuss the possibilities of action and suggested: "maintenance of the status quo, fencing of the park boundary, a combination of fences and buffer zones near the park boundary and the complete eradication of the hybridized park bison with replacement by a disease-free herd of wood bison."&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2002, 114&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a debate between [[Environment Canada]], who was in favour of the eradication, and Wood Buffalo National Park staff, who opposed it. The park staff argued that the risk of the diseased bison infecting cattle was overstated and that it was to justify using the bison for commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2002, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the opposition the diseased bison were not slaughtered.

===Social, cultural, and political forces===
Aboriginals opposed the creation of the Wood Buffalo National Park in 1922 and continued to protest their opposition even after it was established.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 24&lt;/ref&gt;  With the creation of the park, non-treaty Aboriginals were removed and the treaty Aboriginals were allowed to continue to hunt under strict regulation by the park staff.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 25&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal hunting cultures were not taken into consideration when these laws were enforced, instead the preservation of the bison was a bigger concern to the federal government. After 1945, government wildlife workers became interested in developing the North and realized the economic benefits that the bison could provide them.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 140&lt;/ref&gt; CWS biologist William Fuller, in his study of the bison infected with tuberculosis, provided the federal government with the justification it needed to slaughter the bison for commercial and economic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term implications===
According to historian John Sandlos, several historical forces converged in shaping wildlife conservation in northern Canada: "the disdain among conservationists for traditional hunting cultures, the authoritarian approach of the state to [[wildlife conservation]], the rise of scientific knowledge," and a broader "modernization agenda in the region".&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 241&lt;/ref&gt; Federal wildlife officials combined the philosophies of wildlife preservation and utilitarian conservation, "arguing for the salvation of the bison based on the contradictory images of a wilderness [frontier] and a semipastoral landscape".&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buffalo National Park]], established in 1909 in [[Wainwright, Alberta]], received its first shipment of 325 bison on June 16, 1909 after being transferred from [[Elk Island National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Brower 2008, 21&lt;/ref&gt;  The national park was created to preserve the plains bison that were on the brink of extinction in the mid-1880s mostly due to systematic slaughter, increased settlement and advances in hunting practices.&lt;ref&gt;Brower 2008, 2&lt;/ref&gt;  After the arrival of numerous shipments, the bison population at Buffalo National Park increased rapidly and exceeded 2,000 by 1916, resulting in the largest bison herd in the world.  The rapid growth of the bison population appears to have been one indicator of the saving effort's success despite having little information of, or precedent for, efficient ways to save and increase wild animal populations other than in the mountain parks.&lt;ref&gt;Brower 2008, 42&lt;/ref&gt;  The transfer of plains bison from the overpopulated range in Buffalo National Park to the understocked range in [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] resulted in hybridization between the species and the infection of the northern herds with [[tuberculosis]] and [[brucellosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Not until the 1930s would park and wildlife managers begin to study the relationships within species and with their environment, and ideas of carrying capacity, so administrators were treading in unfamiliar territory when the reserve was established.&lt;ref&gt;Brower 2008, 42&lt;/ref&gt;  The placement of the park area on poor agricultural land coupled with an overpopulation problem led to the degradation of the range and the spread of disease.  Experiments such as crossbreeding bison and domestic cattle and commercializing the herd were unsuccessful. The Canadian Parks Branch lacked sufficient funding to run the park or to remedy the crises the bison faced. After deciding to close the park in 1939, the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)]] repurposed the area for military training and the bison disappeared once again.&lt;ref&gt;Brower 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  During its thirty-one years of activity, Buffalo National Park played an important role in saving the plains bison from extinction.

===Wood Buffalo National Park===
[[Wood Buffalo National Park]], established in 1922 in northeastern Alberta and the southern portion of The Northwest Territories, is North America's largest [[national park]], at 44,800 km2.  It served to protect herds of bison that had dropped in numbers from an estimated 40 million in 1830 to less than 1000 by 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Carbyn, Lunn and Timoney 1998, 463&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite harboring bovine diseases such as tuberculosis and brucellosis, the introduced and resident population increased to somewhere between 10,000 and 12,000 by 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Carbyn, Lunn and Timoney 1998, 164&lt;/ref&gt;  The bison population reached 12,500 to 15,000 by the late 1940s and early 1950s but by 1998, [[Parks Canada]] documented that the population had decreased to approximately 2,300.  This decline was due to various factors such as slaughters, cessation of wolf poisoning, round-ups for disease control, floods, diseases, predation, and habitat changes.  These significant declines, as well as the elimination of existing pure strain bison caused major political debate on the future of bison in the park and the presence of contagious bovine diseases. In August 1990, a review panel supported by the federal government recommended the introduction of disease-free wood bison from Elk Island National Park and potentially elsewhere, but due to a quick and negative public response, no action was taken.  From 1996 to 2001, a 5-year Bison Research and Containment Program (BRCP) was conducted to assess the prevalence and impact of brucellosis and tuberculosis on the bison population of Wood Buffalo National Park.&lt;ref&gt;Carbyn, Lunn and Timoney 1998, 164&lt;/ref&gt; To understand the changing dynamics of this particular ecosystem, multiple research studies continue to this day.

==Interactions between Aboriginals and government officials==

===Historical conflicts over bison===
The traditional hunting cultures of the Cree, Dene, and Inuit peoples came into direct conflict with the Canadian federal government's wildlife conservation programs.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 16&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts arose over the issues of access and control over bison for the purposes of subsistence and commodity production. These conflicts occurred between Aboriginal hunters, government officials, and park administrators due to each group's divergent approaches to wildlife resource management. The utilitarian, scientific conservation approach employed by federal bison management programs was incompatible with the traditional hunting cultures of northern Aboriginals. However, Cree, Dene, and Inuit communities that hunted and trapped in Wood Buffalo Park formally resisted government policy by writing letters, signing petitions, and boycotting treaty payments&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Less formally, many Aboriginal hunters simply refused to obey the wildlife laws, exercising their traditional right to hunt bison.

===Assertion of state control over Aboriginal hunters===
The 1894 Unorganized Territories Game Preservation Act introduced regulations that severely limited the ability of the Cree, Dene, and Inuit peoples to access wildlife on their traditional territories. By the 1920s, Aboriginals were excluded from hunting and trapping grounds contained in Wood Buffalo National Park. The establishment of a game warden service in the park allowed for direct surveillance and supervisory control over Aboriginal hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the most basic elements of the Aboriginal subsistence cycle, including seasonal movements, fur trapping, and the gathering of food, were redefined as criminal activities through federal game regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 236&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian John Sandlos, attitudes towards Cree, Dene, and Inuit hunters were socially constructed and flawed due to observer bias, racial stereotyping, and inaccurate reporting by park officials.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Sandlos emphasizes that incidents of wildlife overkill does not undermine the right or ability of Aboriginal hunters to manage local bison populations in partnership with government experts.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sandlos, the introduction of national parks and game regulations was central to the assertion of state authority over the traditional hunting cultures of the Cree, Dene, and Inuit peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Sandlos argues that the early wildlife conservation movement was shaped by the "civilizing ideology" of the Canadian government's colonial agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 6&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Aboriginal hunters in the Northwest Territories was considered detrimental to the government's utilitarian and scientific approach to wildlife management, which was designed to produce a surplus of bison which could then be exploited as commodities. Federal wildlife officials portrayed Aboriginal hunters as having a destructive influence on bison populations, which legitimized the assertion of state control over the subsistence cultures of the Cree, Dene, and Inuit.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 12&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural stereotype that viewed Aboriginal hunting practices as reckless, immoral, and wasteful became firmly entrenched within bison conservation programs. Federal officials viewed Aboriginal hunters as a threat to their wildlife management and development schemes for the north, and therefore, subjected them to regulation and control.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social, cultural, political, and economic implications for Aboriginals===
The proposed bison ranching schemes in Wood Buffalo National Park required a complete transformation of the economic and social lives of Dene and Inuit hunters. The intensive management of bison for the purposes of commodity production entailed the introduction of capitalism, marginalization of the local hunting and trapping economy, and conversion of Aboriginal hunters into wage labourers.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 236&lt;/ref&gt; Federal wildlife officials hoped that the introduction of a northern ranching economy would persuade Aboriginals to give up hunting and trapping in favour of more stable, productive lives as labourers or ranchers.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 238&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s, state policies controlled nearly every aspect of the social, cultural, and material lives of northern Aboriginals. While many Aboriginals were encouraged to assimilate into the modern industrial economy, others became dependent wards of the state through relocation onto reservations or re-education in [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 242&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of control over traditional territories and subsistence food resources became a political issue, impacting Aboriginal self-determination, cultural continuity, and health status.

 [[File:PlainsBisonForestryFarm.jpg|thumb|Domesticated bison at the Plains Bison Forestry Farm. Early conservation efforts were undermined by the federal government's goal of domesticating northern bison populations for commercial purposes.]]

===Interactions on the Great Plains===
Many Aboriginal groups had become nomadic bison hunters in response to Euroamerican westward expansion and economic development, which had made the robe trade highly lucrative.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001, 93&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse of the bison population on the Great Plains eliminated the primary source of wealth of these groups in addition to destroying their lands and livelihoods. While white and indigenous hunters both contributed to the culling of the bison population, white hunters tended to be far more destructive in their hunting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001, 137&lt;/ref&gt; While Aboriginal hunting groups participated in the bison hunt in order to support themselves, Euroamericans were actively trying to clear the plains of bison populations to make way for settlers and domesticated animals.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg 2001, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological implications for bison populations===
Early conservation efforts to preserve the iconic bison were ultimately undermined by the federal government's goal of domesticating northern bison populations for commercial purposes. The utilitarian, scientific approach to bison management prevented the state from comprehending the complexity of local ecosystems and human cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 234&lt;/ref&gt; The narrow focus on production resulted in poor federal wildlife management decisions, such as the transfer of thousands of plains bison from the overpopulated range in Buffalo National Park to the supposedly understocked range in Wood Buffalo National.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 234&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer had disastrous ecological consequences, including hybridization between the plains and wood bison species and the infection of the northern herds with tuberculosis and brucellosis.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2007, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary bison conservation==

===Current efforts===
Contemporary bison conservation is informed by the legacy of historical efforts by the Canadian federal government. [[Parks Canada]] plans to reintroduce a breeding population of the [[Local extinction|extirpated]] plains bison to [[Banff National Park]]. Goals include conservation of the plains bison, a native [[keystone species]], as well as [[ecological restoration]], inspiring discovery, and providing an "authentic national park experience."&lt;ref&gt;"Plains bison reintroduction in Banff National Park."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Parks Canada, the bison remains "emblematic of the wild Canadian west."&lt;ref&gt;"Plains bison reintroduction in Banff National Park."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Prairie Foundation]] is planning to create the [[American Prairie Reserve]] in [[Montana]] to restore the native prairie ecosystem and bison populations. Plains bison will be transferred to the reserve from the [[Elk Island National Park]] in Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;"Reclaiming Montana: Born to be wild," ''The Economist''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the development of co-management regimes and increased Aboriginal participation in the wildlife policy process, the colonial legacy of the state management era still lingers. These current bison conservation initiatives do not discuss Aboriginal use of subsistence resources in national parks and reserves. It is unclear whether Aboriginal participation and [[Traditional Ecological Knowledge]] will be incorporated into reintroduction plans. Although the Cree and Dene are now recognized as official participants in the management of wildlife and protected areas, Sandlos argues that this "tentative shift in political power represents an incomplete attempt to decolonize wildlife management practices in the North."&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2008, 17&lt;/ref&gt; The weak powers given to Aboriginal people on wildlife advisory boards allow the state to maintain political authority over wildlife resources, while giving the appearance of a participatory consensus-building approach with Aboriginal hunters. Sandlos suggests that the advisory nature of co-management boards is based on the implicit colonial assumption that local Aboriginal resource management systems are deficient, and that the role of the state is essential to the formation of wildlife policy in Canada's north.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlos 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Current bison conservation efforts face numerous social and ecological challenges, due to the history of early preservation methods that conducted species conservation at the expense of ecological function. Today, conservation groups are increasingly focusing on preservation of bison a native species and conducting research to prove their status as endangered animals. The [[IUCN]] Bison Specialist Group is currently completing a new status assessment and conducting a review to determine if the species should be red-listed as threatened or endangered.&lt;ref&gt;Freese et al. 2007, 181&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-profit groups such as Nature Conservancy Canada's Old-Man-on-His-Back Preserve in Alberta are creating conservation herds in the Elk Islands, while private sector groups such as Turner Enterprises are separating cattle-gene-free herds.&lt;ref&gt;Freese et al. 2007, 182&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Aboriginal efforts are underway to create tribal wildlife reserves with wild bison populations.
[[File:Buffalo+meat+cans.jpg|thumb|Bison meat is now sold commercially throughout North America.]]

===Commercial bison industry===
In direct conflict with wild bison conservation efforts is the commercial bison industry, which continues to breed bison for food. Due to the industry's view of bison as a commodity, the role of the bison as an important species for the ecology of grassland ecosystems remains largely theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland 2011, 24&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, wildlife preservation efforts had transformed into a bison ranching industry, and many parks in Canada were almost indistinguishable from the agricultural operations that surrounded them.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 121&lt;/ref&gt; The bison, the same animal that symbolized the disappearing wild, was transformed into "meat" by the very institutions that had been instrumental to its rescue and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Loo 2006, 122&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the bison herds have become hybridized with cattle species, due to commercial efforts to create "cattalo" during the period when bison numbers were very low in the late 1800s and early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Freese et al. 2007, 178&lt;/ref&gt; Today, of the total 400,000 plains bison in North America, only about 20,000 are considered "wildlife."&lt;ref&gt;Ireland 2011, 25&lt;/ref&gt; As such statistics show, contemporary bison conservation is more complicated than simple efforts to increase the species' population; modern conservation measures need to focus on returning the bison to its wild state through the restoration of native prairie ecosystems. The Canadian Bison Association (CBA), an organization composed of over 1,500 producers and 250,000 bison, are working in cooperation with numerous conservation groups to develop strategies to help return bison to its natural, wild state.&lt;ref&gt;"Bison – Canadian conservation success," ''Canadian Bison''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Husein Gradaščević'''{{Cref2|a}} (31 August 1802–17 August 1834) was an [[Bosnia Eyalet|Ottoman Bosnian]] and later independent [[Bosniak]] military commander who later led a rebellion against the Ottoman government, seeking autonomy for Bosnia.  Born into a Bosnian Muslim noble family, Gradaščević became the captain of Gradačac in the early 1820s, succeeding his relatives (among whom were his father) at the position. He grew up surrounded by a political climate of turmoil in the western reaches of the Ottoman Empire. With the Russo-Turkish war (1828–29), Gradaščević's importance rose; the Bosnian governor gave him the task of mobilizing an army between the Drina and Vrbas. By 1830, Gradaščević became the spokesperson of all Ottoman captains in Bosnia, and coordinated the defense in light of a possible Serbian invasion. Sparked by Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]]'s reforms that abolished the [[Janissaries]] and weakened the privileges of the nobility, and the autonomy and territory granted to the [[Principality of Serbia]], much of the Bosnian nobility united and revolted. Gradaščević was chosen as the leader, and claimed the title of Vizier. This uprising, with goals of autonomy, lasted three years and included termination of Ottoman loyals mainly in Herzegovina. Among notable accomplishments, Gradaščević led forces victorious against the Ottoman field marshal in Kosovo. The uprising failed, while all captaincies were abolished by 1835. Temporarily exiled in Austria, he negotiated his return with the Sultan and was allowed to enter all of the Ottoman Empire except Bosnia. He died under controversial circumstances in 1834 and was buried in the Ejub cemetery in [[Constantinople]]. 

Gradaščević received the honorific "the Dragon of Bosnia" ({{lang|sh|Zmaj od Bosne}}), and is considered a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] [[folk hero]] and one of the most revered figures in the [[history of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

==Early and personal life==
 [[File:Gradacac 15 - Rodna kuca Husejn kapetana.JPG|thumb|left|Birth house of Husein Gradaščević.]]
The first known captain of the Gradaščević captaincy in Gradačac is Mehmed-''kapetan'', whose rule lasted until 1169 A.H. (1755–1756). The name of his successor is unknown, although this next captain was eventually succeeded by Mehmed-''kapetan'' in 1765. (It was a common tradition among Bosniaks for children to be named after their paternal grandfathers). Mehmed-''kapetan'' was in turn succeeded by [[Osman Gradaščević]], who was known to be one of the most powerful Bosnian captains of the period. Osman-''kapetan'' had six male heirs. In order of birth, they were Hamza, Murat, Osman, Muharem, Husein, and H. Bećir. As Hamza died in 1212 A.H. (1797–1798) it was Murat-''beg'' Gradaščević who succeeded him to the captaincy.

Husein was born in the town of [[Gradačac]] (in northern Bosnia),{{sfn|Donia|2006|p=29}} to Osman and his wife Melek-''hanuma'' in 1802, at the Gradaščević family house. Outside of family tradition and folklore invented much later, little is known of his childhood. It is said that he spent much time around the family fort while it was undergoing renovations. He grew up during turbulent times and taking into account his father's military experience and brother Osman's services during the 1813 [[First Serbian Uprising|war against Serbia]], young Husein surely heard many first hand accounts that shaped his personality.

Osman senior died in 1812 when Husein was merely ten years old. Certain scholars have argued that his mother was also dead by then, although some family traditions claim otherwise. By all accounts, his mother had a strong influence on Husein's upbringing. Upon his father's death, Husein deferred to his eldest brother Murat because of his age and status as successor to the Gradačac captaincy, in fact Husein Gradaščević rose to the head of the Gradačac military captaincy only after his brother Murat was poisoned in the 1821 by rival aristocrats attempting to gain the favor of the desperate [[Grand Vizier]].

As his status implied, Husein was well educated, learning to read and write at an early age. At sixteen he was taught [[Arabic calligraphy]] by Murat's personal scribe ''[[Mullah]]'' [[Mustevica]], who praised his brightness and called him a "gifted child". In addition to this, Husein was taught by two [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi]] ''[[dervish]]es''. It is not known for certain whether Husein belonged to a dervish order but, based on his great piety and the modest lifestyle that he would demonstrate in the future, it is often assumed that he did.

Husein married Hanifa, sister of Mahmud-''kapetan'' of [[Derventa]], at an early age. Although the exact date is unknown, his son Muhamed-''beg'' Gradaščević was probably born no later than 1822 when Husein himself was twenty years old. The pair would also have a daughter, Šefika, born in 1833. Neither Muhamed nor Šefika were known to have had children themselves.

==Gradačac captaincy==
[[File:Kula husein kapetan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gradačac Castle]]. The administrative headquarters of the Gradačac captains.]]

When Husein took over the Gradačac captaincy, he focused most of his attention on administration of internal affairs. It is notable that all of Husein's construction projects were related to the city of Gradačac and its immediate area. During his rule, Gradačac further expanded its status as one of the most prosperous captaincies in Bosnia.

The first and most notable construction was that of the [[Gradačac Castle]]. The fort had existed for decades and was subject to extensive renovations since the time of Mehmed-kapetan in 1765. Husein's father Osman and brother Murat had done some work as well, in 1808 and 1818–19 respectively. However, the exact nature of Husein's contribution is unknown. The castle's tower has long been associated with Husein but architectural evidence points to the tower existing alongside the rest of the complex from earlier times. It seems likely that Husein was merely responsible for a significant renovation of the tower that lingered in the people's memory.

Husein did have a new castle built, in a large project which included the construction of an artificial island surrounded by a moat up to 100 meters wide and of a great depth. The castle was named ''Čardak'' and the surrounding village quickly derived its name from it. The walls were of an oval shape, the entire structure being seventeen meters long and eight meters wide. The complex and area also included a mosque, wells, a fishery, and hunting grounds.

Within the Gradačac city walls Husein's most significant contribution to the city was the clock tower ({{lang-bs|sahat-kula}}) which was built in 1824. The object's base is 5.5 by 5.5 meters, while the height is 21.50 meters. It was the last object of this type to be built in Bosnia.

Some 40 to 50 meters outside the city walls lies Husein's greatest architectural contribution to Gradačac: the [[Husejnija mosque]]. Built in 1826, it features an [[octagon]]al dome roof and a particularly high [[minaret]] of 25 m. Three smaller octagonal domes are found above the [[verandah]]. Islamic decorations and artistry are seen on the door and surrounding wall as well as the interior. The entire complex is surrounded by a small stone wall and gate.

Husein's rule in Gradačac was also notable because of his tolerance towards the Christian populace under his jurisdiction; both Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]. Though social norms of the time dictated that the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman sultan's]] official approval was necessary for the construction of any non-Islamic religious buildings, Husein approved the construction of several such buildings without it. A Catholic school was built in the village of [[Tolisa]] in 1823, followed by a large church that could hold 1,500 people. Another two Catholic churches were built in the villages of [[Dubrave, Brčko|Dubrave]] and [[Garevac]], while an Orthodox church was built in the hamlet of [[Obudovac]]. During Husein's captaincy, the Christians in Gradačac were known to be the most satisfied in Bosnia.

Husein entered the higher political scene in Bosnia in 1827, largely due to the impending [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)]] and his role in preparing the defense of the boundaries of Bosnia. Upon receiving orders from the Bosnian [[vizier]] [[Abdurahim Pasha of Bosnia|Abdurahim Pasha]], Husein mobilized the Gradačac populace and strengthened his defenses. During talks held in [[Sarajevo]] between the vizier and the Bosnian captains, it is said that Husein stayed the longest to discuss strategy. He was appointed commander of an army that he was to mobilize from the lands between the [[Drina]] to the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]]. By all accounts, he did a satisfactory job. However, in mid-June 1828, Husein had to rush to Sarajevo with a small accompanying force to get the vizier to safety following a revolt among the troops.

By 1830, Husein had risen to new political heights as he was able to speak on behalf of all (or at least most of) the captains of Bosnia. At that time, he was coordinating the defense of Bosnia against a possible invasion by Serbia, as well as taking it upon himself to address [[Austrian Empire|Austrian authorities]] and warn them against any incursion across the [[Sava]]. The authority he wielded in the later years of his captaincy in Gradačac explains the great role he was to have in the years to follow.

{{Main|Bosnian uprising (1831–32)}} [[File:Mahmud II.jpg|thumb|right|Sultan [[Mahmud II]]'s actions were the catalyst for the Bosnian autonomy movement.]]

In the late 1820s, Sultan [[Mahmud II]] reintroduced a [[Ottoman military reforms|set of reforms]] that called for further expansion of the centrally controlled army (''nizam''), new taxes and more Ottoman bureaucracy. These reforms weakened the special status and privileges of the Bosnian Muslim nobility. Many Bosnian leaders had also been disappointed by Ottoman negligence to the plight of the Muslim refugees arriving from the [[Principality of Serbia]]. Contrary to popular belief, however, Husein Gradaščević was not greatly opposed to these reforms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 1826, during the [[Auspicious Incident]], Sultan [[Mahmud II]] abolished the [[Janissaries]], through use of military force, executions and exile. Mahmud II then banned the revered [[Bektashi Order]] and decreed his Turkish commanders to launch campaigns against prominent Balkan Muslim leaders causing great instability in [[Rumelia]]. Gradaščević's immediate reaction to the abolition of the Janissaries was not unlike that of the rest of the Bosnian aristocracy; Gradaščević threatened with military force to subdue anybody opposed to the Sarajevo Janissaries. When the Janissaries killed ''[[naqib al-ashraf]]'' [[Imam]] Nurudin-effendi Šerifović, however, his tone shifted and he rapidly distanced himself from their cause. Gradaščević did realize that economic hardship was the main reason of Janissary dissent.{{cn|date=January 2018}} After this, Gradaščević generally maintained good relations with imperial authorities in Bosnia. When Abdurahim Pasha became vizier in 1827, Gradaščević was said to have become one of his more trusted advisors. This culminated in Gradaščević's large role in the Bosnian mobilization for the Russo-Ottoman war. Following a riot in the Sarajevo camp during these preparations, Gradaščević even provided shelter for the ousted Abdurahim Pasha in Gradačac before assisting him in his escape from the country. Gradaščević was also relatively loyal to Abdurahim's successor, Namık Pasha, reinforcing Ottoman garrisons in [[Šabac]] upon his orders.

The turning point for Gradaščević came with the end of the Russo-Ottoman War and the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] on 14 September 1829. According to the provisions of the treaty, the Ottoman Empire had to grant [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] to Serbia, and also cede it six districts. This outraged the Bosnian nobility, launching numerous protests.

Between 20 and 31 December 1830, Gradaščević hosted a gathering of Bosniak aristocrats in Gradačac. A month later, from 20 January to 5 February, another meeting was held in [[Tuzla]] to prepare for a revolt. From there, a call was issued to the Bosnian Muslim populace asking them to rise up to the defense of Bosnia. It was then that the popular Gradaščević was unofficially chosen to head the rebellion. Further details of this meeting are murky and disputable. According to certain contemporary sources, their demands from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] were:{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

*Repeal the privileges granted to Serbia and, in particular, return the six districts to Bosnia.
*Cease the implementation of the ''nizam'' military reforms.
*End the governorship of the Bosnia Eyalet and accept the implementation of an autonomous Bosnian government headed by a local leader. In return, Bosnia would pay a yearly tribute.

Another outcome of the Tuzla meeting was an agreement that another general meeting should be held in [[Travnik]]. Since Travnik was the seat of the Bosnia Eyalet and of the vizier, the planned meeting was in effect a direct confrontation with Ottoman authority. Gradaščević thus asked all involved to help assemble an army beforehand. On 29 March 1831, Gradaščević set out towards Travnik with some 4,000 men.

Upon hearing word of the oncoming force, Namık Pasha is said to have gone to the Travnik fort and called the [[Sulejmanpašić]] brothers to his aid. When the rebel army arrived in Travnik they fired several warning shots at the castle, warning the vizier that they were prepared for a military encounter. Meanwhile, Gradaščević sent a detachment of his forces, under the command of Memiš-aga of Srebrenica, to meet Sulejmanpašić's reinforcements. The two sides met at Pirot, on the outskirts of Travnik, on 7 April. There, Memiš-aga defeated the Sulejmanpašić brothers and their 2,000-man army, forcing them to retreat and destroying the possessions of the Sulejmanpašić family. On 21 May, Namık Pasha fled to [[Stolac]] following a short [[siege]]. Soon afterwards, Husein Gradaščević was honorably proclaimed the "commander of Bosnia, chosen by the will of the people". On 31 May he demanded that all Bosnian aristocrats immediately join his army, and called on the general populace who wished to do so. Thousands rushed to join him, among them being numerous Christians, who were said to comprise up to a third of his total forces. Gradaščević split his army in two, leaving one part of it in [[Zvornik]] to defend against a possible Serbian incursion. With the bulk of the troops he set out towards Kosovo to meet the Grand vizier, who had been sent with a large army to quell the rebellion. Along the way, he took the city of [[Peć]] with a 25,000-strong army and proceeded to [[Priština]], where he set up his main camp.

The encounter with Grand Vizier [[Reşid Mehmed Pasha]] happened on 18 July near Štimlje. Although both armies were of roughly equal size, the Grand Vizier's troops had superior arms. Gradaščević sent a part of his army under the command of [[Ali Pasha Fidahić]], the captain (''kapetan'') and sanjak-bey of [[Zvornik]], ahead to meet Reşid Pasha's forces. Following a small skirmish, Fihadić feigned a retreat. Thinking that victory was within reach, the Grand Vizier sent his cavalry and artillery into forested terrain. Gradaščević immediately took advantage of this tactical error and executed a punishing counterattack with the bulk of his forces, almost completely annihilating the Ottoman forces. Reşid Pasha himself was injured and barely escaped with his life.

[[File:Tsars Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|The Tsar's Mosque in Sarajevo, where Gradaščević was officially proclaimed the vizier of Bosnia.]]

Following claims from the Grand Vizier that the Sultan would meet all Bosnian demands if the rebel army would return home, Gradaščević and his army turned back. On 10 August the leadership of the rebellion met at Priština and decided that Gradaščević be declared Vizier of Bosnia. Gradaščević refused at first, but eventually accepted. This was made official at an assembly held in [[Sarajevo]] on 12 September, where in front of the [[Tsar's Mosque]], those present swore on the [[Quran]] to be loyal to Gradaščević and declared that, despite potential failure and death, there would be no turning back.

At this point, Gradaščević was not only the supreme military commander, but Bosnia's leading civilian authority as well. He established a court around him, and after initially making himself at home in Sarajevo, he moved the center of Bosnian politics to Travnik, making it the ''de facto'' capital of the rebel state. In Travnik, he established a ''[[divan]]'', a Bosnian congress, which together with him made up the Bosnian government. Gradaščević also collected taxes at this time, and executed various local opponents of the autonomy movement. He gained a reputation as a hero and a strong, brave, and decisive ruler. One anecdote that illustrates this is Husein-kapetan's alleged response to whether he was scared of waging war against the Ottoman Empire. ''God I fear slightly,'' Gradaščević replied, ''the Sultan not at all, and the Grand Vizier no more than my own horse.''

During this lull in armed conflict with the Ottomans, attention was turned to the autonomy movement's strong opposition in Herzegovina. A small campaign was launched against the region from three different directions:

#An army from Sarajevo was ordered to attack Stolac for a final encounter with Namik-paša, who had fled there following Gradaščević's capture of Travnik.
#An army from [[Bosanska Krajina|Krajina]] was to assist the Sarajevan forces in this endeavor.
#Armies from [[Posavina]] and south [[Podrinje]] were to attack [[Gacko]] and local captain [[Smail-aga Čengić]].

As it happened, Namık Pasha had already abandoned Stolac, so this attack was put on hold. The attack on Gacko was a failure as the forces from Posavina and south Podrinje were defeated by Čengić's troops. There was one success, however; in October, Husein Gradaščević had deployed an army under the command of [[Ahmed-beg Resulbegović]], who had put his life in danger while attempting to capture [[Trebinje]] from Resulbegović's loyalist and heavily armed cousins.

A Bosnian delegation reached the Grand Vizier's camp in [[Skopje]] in November, and was promised that the Grand Vizier would insist to the Sultan to accept Bosnian demands and appoint Gradaščević as the official Vizier of an autonomous Bosnia. His true intentions, however, were manifested by early December when he attacked Bosnian rebel units stationed on the outskirts of [[Novi Pazar]]. Yet again, the rebel army handed a defeat to the imperial forces. Due to a particularly strong winter though, the Bosnian troops were forced to return home.

Meanwhile, in Bosnia, Gradaščević decided to carry on his campaign against the captains in Herzegovina that were loyal to the Sultan, despite the unfavorable climate. The captain of [[Livno]], [[Ibrahim-beg Fidrus]], was ordered to launch a final attack against the local captains and to thus end all domestic opposition to the autonomy movement. To achieve this, Fidrus first attacked [[Ljubuški]] and the local captain Sulejman-beg, which he defeated and then secured the whole of Herzegovina except Stolac in the process. Unfortunately, the rebel detachments that laid siege to the Stolac Fortress met cannon fire and ambushes organized by [[Ali-paša Rizvanbegović]] in early March of the next year. Receiving information that the Bosnian ranks were depleted due to the winter, Rizvanbegović broke the siege, counterattacking the rebels and dispersing their forces; in doing so he proved that his fortress at Stolac was nearly impregnable.&lt;ref name="google6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed|author1=Donia, R.J.|author2=Van Antwerp Fine, J.|date=1994|publisher=Hurst|isbn=9781850652120|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=0rIGA0rluO0C&amp;pg=PA62|page=62|accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Husein Gradaščević, knowing of the eventual outcome, sent another well-equipped force towards Stolac from Sarajevo, under the command of [[Mujaga Zlatar]], but it was ordered back on 16 March after receiving news of a major offensive on Bosnia being planned by the Grand Vizier.

The Ottoman campaign began in early February. The Grand Vizier sent two armies: one from [[Vučitrn]] and one from [[Shkodër]]. Both armies headed toward Sarajevo, and Gradaščević sent an army of around 10,000 men to meet them. When the Vizier's troops succeeded in crossing the [[Drina]], Gradaščević ordered 6,000 men under Ali-paša Fidahić to meet them in [[Rogatica]] while units stationed in [[Višegrad]] were to head to [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pale]] on the outskirts of Sarajevo. The encounter between the two sides finally happened on the [[Glasinac plains]] to the east of Sarajevo, near [[Sokolac]], at the end of May. The Bosnian army was led by Gradaščević himself, while the Ottoman troops were under the command of [[Kara Mahmud Hamdi-paša]], the new imperially recognized vizier of Bosnia. In this first encounter, Gradaščević was forced to retreat to Pale. The fighting continued in Pale and Gradaščević was once again forced to retreat; this time to Sarajevo. There, a council of captains decided that the fight would continue.

By 1832, after a series of smaller clashes, a decisive battle occurred outside [[Sarajevo]]; although Husein Gradaščević was initially successful, he was defeated when Serbian rebels arrived and sided with and reinforced the forces of [[Mahmud II]].&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bosniak|author1=Zulfikarpašić, A.|author2=Djilas, M.|author3=Gaće, N.|date=1998|publisher=Hurst|isbn=9781850653394|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=hUneqCTh2YIC&amp;pg=PA17|page=17|accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final battle was played out on 4 June at [[Stup]], a small locality on the road between Sarajevo and [[Ilidža]]. After a long, intense battle, it seemed Gradaščević had once again defeated the Sultan's army. Near the very end, however, Herzegovinian troops under the command of Ali-paša Rizvanbegović and Smail-aga Čengić broke through defenses Gradaščević had set up on his flank and joined the fighting. Overwhelmed by the unexpected attack from behind, the rebel army was forced to retreat into the city of Sarajevo itself. It was decided that further military resistance would be futile. Gradaščević fled to Gradačac as the imperial army entered the city on 5 June and prepared to march on Travnik. Upon realizing the difficulties that his home and family would experience if he stayed there, Gradaščević decided to leave Gradačac and continue on to [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] lands instead.

==Exile and death==
[[File:Istanbul - Pierre Loti Cafe - 01.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Golden Horn from Eyup Sultan Cemetery where Gradaščević is buried.]]

If the choice to flee Bosnia was not already clear, the Sultan's furious ''[[fatwa]]'' declaring Gradaščević "no good", an "evil-doer", a "traitor", a "criminal" and a "rebel" may have convinced Gradaščević to leave. Due to various customs and procedures, however, Gradaščević's departure from Bosnia was held up for several days. After pleading with Austrian officials to ease their restrictions, Gradaščević finally reached the [[Sava]] River boundary with a large party of followers on 16 June. He crossed the river into [[Habsburg]] lands the same day, along with some 100 followers, servants, and family. Though he expected to be treated as a Bosnian vizier, he instead found himself held in quarantine in [[Slavonski Brod]] for nearly a month, with his weapons and many of his possessions taken away.

Gradaščević and other rebels managed to flee across the Sava to Vinkovci and then Osijek, in Austrian territory. Some 66 men, 12 women, 135 servants and 252 horses accompanied him.{{sfn|Đordić|1996|p=60}}

Austrian officials faced constant pressure from the Ottoman government to move Gradaščević as far away from the border as possible. On 4 July he was moved to [[Osijek]] where he essentially lived in internment. His communications with the rest of his family and social circle were severely limited and he complained about his treatment to the authorities several times. His conditions would eventually improve, and before he left [[Osijek]] he remarked to local officials that he had enjoyed his stay there. Although intensely homesick and only partially in control of his own destiny, Gradaščević retained his pride and dignity. He was said to have lived a luxurious life that included [[jousting]] competitions with his companions.

In late 1832, he agreed to return to Ottoman territory to receive a ''ferman'' of pardon from the Sultan. The terms, read to him in [[Zemun]], were very harsh, insisting that Gradaščević not only never to return to Bosnia, but also never to set foot on the European lands of the [[Ottoman Empire]] either. Disappointed, Gradaščević was forced to obey the terms and rode on to [[Belgrade]]. He entered the city on 14 October in the manner of a true [[vizier]], riding a horse decked out in silver and gold and accompanied by a large procession. He was greeted as a hero by the [[Muslim]]s in [[Belgrade]] and treated like an equal by the local ''pasha''. Gradaščević stayed in the city for two months, during which his health deteriorated (as was documented by local doctor [[Bartolomeo Kunibert]]). He left the city for [[Constantinople]] in December, but as his daughter was still very young, his wife remained in [[Belgrade]], joining him in the spring of the following year.

In Constantinople Gradaščević lived in an old ''janissary'' barracks at ''atmejdan'' ([[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome square]]) while his family lived in a separate house nearby. He lived a relatively quiet life for the next two years, the only notable event being an offer from the Sultan for Gradaščević to become a high-ranking ''pasha'' in the Nizami army; an offer that Gradaščević indignantly refused.


He died in Constantinople in 1834 at the age of thirty-two.&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sarajevo: A Biography|author=Donia, R.J.|date=2006|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472115570|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ACvJHam2_-oC&amp;pg=PA28|page=28|accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legend has it that he was poisoned by imperial authorities but, considering his long failing health, a more probable cause might have been [[cholera]]. It claims that he was buried in [[Eyup Sultan Cemetery]] near the site of the old veterinary school, but it is not certain.

==Legacy==
[[File:Western Herzegovina 1760 flag.svg|thumb|As a reward for confronting Husein Gradaščević and [[Bosnia Eyalet]], [[Ali-paša Rizvanbegović]] was awarded his very own schismatic [[Pashaluk of Herzegovina]] by [[Mahmud II]], it was later reintegrated into the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in the year 1851.]]

Husein Gradaščević was a living legend in his own time. Upon his death, he also became something of a martyr for Bosnian pride. There was a well-known saying among Bosniaks that ''for years after his death not a single man among our people would be able to hear his name and not shed a tear.'' This positive sentiment was not exclusive to the Muslim population, as Christians from Posavina are thought to have shared a similar view for decades.

Although a majority of the [[Bosniak]]s in [[Herzegovina]] supported the cause of Husein Gradaščević, some of its ruling kapetans such as [[Ali-paša Rizvanbegović]] supported Sultan [[Mahmud II]] for their own personal gains, in the years that followed the ''Herzegovina kapetans'' suffered during the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875–1878)]] mainly due to the lack of a centralized authority in [[Bosnia Eyalet]].

The first historic literature written about Gradaščević can be found in [[Safvet-beg Bašagić]]'s work from 1900, ''A short introduction into the past of Bosnia and Herzegovina''. However, due to historical differences between the Bašagić and Gradaščević families, Safvet-beg's view of Husein-kapetan is somewhat opinionated. A year later, Gradaščević was mentioned by Kunibert in his works on the [[first Serbian Uprising]], which painted a positive picture of Gradaščević as a tragic hero.

In the years that followed, Gradaščević was mentioned, either specifically or in the context of the movement he led, by [[D. Pavlović]], [[Slavko Kaluđerčić]], and [[Hamdija Kreševljaković]]. The general sentiment was that the autonomy movement was merely a reaction to imperial reforms by the Bosnian upper class. This view would be predominant among historians for decades. Gradaščević had a minor resurgence during World War II when [[Ustaše]] launched a propaganda-rooted proposal to bring his remains back to Sarajevo.

During the time of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Communist Yugoslavia]], Gradaščević and his movement were rarely mentioned. The perceived upper-class resistance to implementation of modern reforms did not go well with communist ideology. Gradaščević was briefly mentioned in such a light by [[Avdo Sućeska]] in his 1964 work on Bosnian captains. It would be another 24 years before Gradaščević was mentioned again. This time it was in [[Galib Šljiva]]'s 1988 work on Bosnia in the first half of the 19th century. Though several [[historiography|historiographical]] controversies were resolved, there was no significant shift in the perception of Gradaščević.

Since the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and the Bosniak national awakening, Gradaščević and his movement have experienced a rebirth among historians and the common public alike. Works by [[Ahmed S. Aličić]], [[Mustafa Imamović]], and Husnija Kamberović have all cast Gradaščević in a more positive light. Gradaščević is once again widely considered the greatest Bosniak national hero, and is a symbol of national pride and spirit. The main streets in Gradačac and Sarajevo are both named after him, as well as numerous other places in Bosnia and Herzegovina. An impressive statue and monument to Gradaščević are to be built in Gradačac sometime in the near future. Talk of returning Gradaščević's remains to Bosnia has been proposed, but little has come of it.

In the past few decades, the Bosniaks have given him the honorific "the Dragon of Bosnia".{{sfn|Donia|2006|p=29}}

'''Jian Bozan''' ({{zh|t=翦伯贊|s=翦伯赞|p=Jiǎn Bózàn}}; April 14, 1898 &amp;ndash; December 18, 1968) was a Chinese scholar and Marxist historian of [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] descent. Born in [[Taoyuan County]], Hunan province, Jian became an early supporter of the [[Communist Party of China]]. From 1952 to his death, he was Vice President of [[Peking University]]. Like many authoritative academic figures of his generation, he was persecuted during the [[Cultural Revolution]] over a perceived divergence between his own ideas and that of dominant Maoist orthodoxy of the time. Unable to bear torture, Jian committed suicide in 1968.

==Biography==

=== Family and Ancestor ===
Jian Bozan traces his ancestry to the present-day Xinjiang region of China. He was a direct descendant of a Uyghur General (哈勒巴士) who served the Emperor of the Ming Dynasty in quelling a Miao Rebellion in southeastern China. The Emperor rewarded his family with the surname  "Jian" (翦), and married him to his god-daughter, the Duyi Princess.  Jian Family then settled in Taoyuan County for generations. They gradually integrated into Han Chinese culture over years. "Jian" (翦) is very unusual surname in China.

===Early years and education===
In 1916, he entered school in Beijing, where he studied and conducted research about Chinese economic history.&lt;ref name="Shi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt;  His graduation thesis was a 50,000-character study of the history of China's currency system.&lt;ref name="Wang Changpei"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-SYSJ200902011.htm | title=The Characteristics of Chinese Marxist Historiography——Focusing on the Works of Guo Moruo, Fan Wenlan, Jian Bozan, Lü Zhenyü, and Hou Wailu |author1=Wang, Changpei  |author2=Zhou, Wenjiu | journal=Journal of Historiography | year=2009 | volume=2 | pages=68 | doi= | language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that industry was China's savior, he travelled to the [[University of California]] in 1924 to research economics.  During this time, he studied [[Anti-Dühring]], [[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State]], [[The Communist Manifesto]], and other famous Marxist works.  He returned to China in 1926.&lt;ref name="Shi"/&gt; Jian was a patriot, and participated in the protests leading up to the [[March 18 Massacre]] of that year.&lt;ref name="Wang and Zhou, 68"&gt;Wang and Zhou, 68&lt;/ref&gt; He published his first Marxist interpretation of [[Chinese history]] during the 1930s, and joined the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="Shi"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Weigelin-Schwiedrzik, Susanne| title=On Shi and Lun: Toward a Typology of Historiography in the PRC| journal=History and Theory| year=1996| volume=35| issue=4| pages=74–95| doi=10.2307/2505445 | jstor=2505445 | publisher=Blackwell Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guji.cn/openzjml.php?id=19 |title=Chinese Ancient Classics Net - Jian Bozan |accessdate=2007-09-10 |language=Chinese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610114918/http://www.guji.cn/openzjml.php?id=19 |archivedate=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, while serving as secretary to [[Qin Zhen]], deputy head of the [[Judicial Yuan]], Jian went on a tour of numerous countries around the world.&lt;ref name="Wang and Zhou, 68"/&gt; As a close ally of the Communist Party, Jian became professor of history at [[Peking University]] after the party's rise to power in 1949, and later served as dean of the faculty of history and vice-president of the university.&lt;ref name="Shi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt;

===During the Cultural Revolution===
Jian became a target of struggle during the early stages of the [[Cultural Revolution]].  During the early 1960s, Jian began to advocate historical accounts that combined the methodology of class analysis and [[historicism]].  For this, [[Mao Zedong]] criticized Jian at the end of 1965.  [[Qi Benyu]], a prominent Maoist figure of the time period, also criticized Jian on four counts: opposing the theory of class struggle, denigrating peasant revolutions, praising emperors and kings, and applauding conciliatory policies.&lt;ref name="Beida"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Munro, Robin| title=Settling Accounts with the Cultural Revolution at Beijing University 1977-78| journal=The China Quarterly| year=1980| volume=82| pages=308–333| issue=82| doi=10.1017/S030574100001239X| jstor=653067}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jian also suffered from severe torture and was lynched at the hands of radicals. The ill treatment  drove Jian to commit suicide.  Jian, along with his wife, took an overdose of sleeping pills and died on December 18, 1968.&lt;ref name="Shi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wang, Youqin| title=The Second Wave of Violent Persecution of Teachers: the Revolution of 1968 | journal=35th International Congress of Asian and North African Studies| year=1997| url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/ywang/history/1968teacher.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The John Carter Brown Library''' is an independently funded research library of history and the humanities on the campus of [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The library's rare book, manuscript, and map collections encompass a variety of topics related to the history of European discovery, exploration, settlement, and development of the New World until circa 1825.

==History==

The Library originated in the mid-nineteenth century when it began as the private collection of [[John Carter Brown]] (1797–1874) who conceived of it being a collection of books written about the discovery of the New World, rather than a gentleman’s financial investment or a rich man’s adornment. This enlightened and pioneering collecting passion was transmitted to his son, [[John Nicholas Brown I|John Nicholas Brown]] (1861–1900). Until John Nicholas Brown’s untimely death, the John Carter Brown Library was kept in a special fireproof room in the Brown family house in the 1792 Nightingale-Brown House. The will of John Nicholas Brown directed that within four years of his death, his trustees were to establish the collection, together with a building to house it, at a permanent site of their choice. They selected Brown University (named in honor of John Carter Brown’s father, [[Nicholas Brown, Jr.]]).

==Scope and holdings==

The collection of the John Carter Brown Library consists of more than 50,000 books written about both North and South America until roughly the end of the colonial era in the Americas, as well as around 16,000 specialized reference books providing supplementary information about the Library’s holdings. The Library also holds a major collection of prints, manuscripts, and maps of the New World.

The collection of the John Carter Brown Library begins chronologically with fifteenth-century editions of Columbus’s celebrated “letter” to the Spanish court announcing the discovery of lands to the west.  The Library houses one of the largest collections of books printed in British North America before 1800, the world’s most complete collection of Mexican works printed before 1600, the largest collection of printed works relating to Brazil before 1820, the finest collection of printed sources for the study of early Canada and the Caribbean to be found in the United States, nearly three-quarters of all known imprints in the native languages of North and South America from the colonial period, and the largest collection of political pamphlets produced at the time of the American revolution.

The Library also holds many important maps and prints relating to the New World. These maps include one of the first printed attempts to depict America in cartographic form (the so-called Stevens-Brown map, a prototype of the 1513 Ptolemy Orbis Typus); the first printed map of [[Hernán Cortés]]’s Mexico City, built on the ruins of the Aztec capital, [[Tenochtitlán]]; the earliest known printed plan of a European settlement in what is now the United States (a plan of Fort Caroline built by Huguenot settlers in 1565 near present-day Jacksonville, Florida); and one of the earliest maps to show the French exploration of the Mississippi River, attributed to Louis Joliet.

==The building==
The Library is housed in a Beaux-Arts style building, designed by the architects [[Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge]], and completed in 1904. The building was expanded in 1990, with funds from a donation by New Jersey financier, philanthropist, and Brown alumnus [[Finn M. W. Caspersen]] (B.A. 1963). The four-story annex, designed by the Washington D.C. architects Hartman-Cox, was named the "Caspersen Building" in honor of Caspersen's parents.&lt;ref&gt;Brown University. ''The Dedication of the Caspersen Building September the Seventeenth A. D. MDCCCCXCI'' (Providence, Rhode Island: John Carter Brown Library, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Martha. [https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=J0070 "John Carter Brown Library"] in ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana'' (Providence, Rhode Island: Brown University Library, 1993)&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the main green of Brown University.

==The Archive of Early American Images==
[https://www.brown.edu/Facilities/John_Carter_Brown_Library/pages/ea_hmpg.html The Archive of Early American Images] is drawn from the holdings of the John Carter Brown Library. The AEAI assists scholars in their quest for contemporary images to illustrate their research findings and to facilitate the study of historical images in their own right and in proper context. It is a unique resource for picture researchers, documentary filmmakers, and others looking for material for commercial use. Many of these American images come from books printed in the early modern period that have never been reproduced before.

As of August 2014, the database—which also includes a Map Collection, Political Cartoon Collection, and John Russell Bartlett Boundary Commission Collection—has about 11,270 images and is still growing. Images in this database are accompanied by extensive bibliographical and descriptive information and come from books in most European, and some indigenous, languages from before c. 1825.

==Compilation==

Fragments of the text were discovered in the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] catalogue of the [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] section (CBS){{explain|date=October 2017}} from their excavations at the [[temple]] [[library]] at [[Nippur]]. One fragment of the text found on CBS tablet number 11876 was first published by Hugo Radau in "Miscellaneous Sumerian Texts," number 8 in 1909.&lt;ref name="Radau1909"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugo Radau|title=Miscellaneous Sumerian texts from the temple library of Nippur, 8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skL-HAAACAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=1909|publisher=n.p.}}{{dead link|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radau's fragment was translated by [[Stephen Herbert Langdon]] in 1915.&lt;ref name="LangdonVirolleaud1919"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Langdon|author2=Ch Virolleaud|title=Le poème sumérien du Paradis: du déluge et de la chute de l'homme, 135-146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-RIDAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=1919|publisher=Éditions Ernest Leroux}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langdon published a translation from a {{convert|4|by|4|by|4|by|4|in|cm}} perforated, four sided, Sumerian [[prism (geometry)|prism]] from Nippur and held in the [[Ashmolean]] in Oxford in 1913 (number 1911-405) in "Babylonian Liturgies." The prism contains around 145 lines in eight sections, similar to the [[Hymn to Enlil]]. Langdon called it "A Liturgy to Nintud, Goddess of Creation" and noted that each section ended with the same refrain, which he interpreted as referring "to the creation of man and woman, the Biblical [[Adam and Eve]]."&lt;ref name="Babylonian liturgies: Sumerian texts from the early period and from the library of Ashurbanipal"&gt;{{cite book|title=Babylonian liturgies: Sumerian texts from the early period and from the library of Ashurbanipal, p. 86-|author=Stephen Langdon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xdy5QAAACAAJ|accessdate=2 June 2011|date=1913|publisher=Geushner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langdon translated two further fragments in 1914 and 1917.

The [[myth]] was developed with the addition of CBS 8384, translated by [[George Aaron Barton]] in 1918 and first published as "Sumerian religious texts" in "[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]," number eleven, entitled "A Fragment of the so-called 'Liturgy to Nintud.'"&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Aaron Barton|title=Miscellaneous Babylonian inscriptions, p. 52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=1918|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablet is {{convert|5.25|by|2.4|by|1.2|in|cm}} at its thickest point. Barton's tablet contained nine sections from which he was able to translate sections four, five and six. Barton argued for the abandonment of the myth's subtitle, the "creation of man." He claimed, "So far as the writer can see, there is no allusion in the text to the creation of man." He notes only the allusion to the goddess he called Nintu as "the mother of mankind." He suggested, "Apparently the text celebrated the primitive (or very early) conditions of some town; possibly the founding and growth of the town, but beyond this we can confidently affirm nothing."&lt;ref name="Barton1918"/&gt;

CBS tablet 6520 was published in 1929 by [[Edward Chiera]] in "Sumerian Lexical Texts".&lt;ref&gt;Chiera, Edward., Cuneiform Series, Volume I: Sumerian Lexical Texts from the Temple School of Nippur, Oriental Institute Publications 11, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Chiera also published three more tablets—CBS 7802, CBS 13625 and CBS 14153—in "Sumerian Epics and Myths".&lt;ref name="Chiera1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Chiera|title=Sumerian epics and myths, 108 and 109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEFCPgAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|date=1964|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other translations were made from tablets in the Nippur collection of the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|Museum of the Ancient Orient]] in [[Istanbul]] (Ni).

[[Robert D. Biggs]] translated an exceptionally archaic version of the hymn from [[Tell (archaeology)|Tell]] [[Abu Salabikh]]. He dated this version to around 2600 BCE based upon similarities to tablets found in [[Shuruppak]] and dated to a similar age by Anton Deimer in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Biggs |title=Inscriptions from Tell Abu Salabikh |url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/oip99.pdf |location=Chicago |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1974 |isbn=0-226-62202-9 |at=pp 24-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent radiocarbon dating of samples taken from Tell Abu Salabikh date the site to 2550-2520 BCE however, a timeframe slightly more recent than the one Biggs proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Wright |title=Problems of Absolute Chronology in Protohistoric Messopotamia |url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/paleo_0153-9345_1980_num_6_1_4262 |journal=Paleoorient |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=1980 |at=p 95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biggs recognized various differences in the archaic [[cuneiform]] and that "the literary texts of this period were unrecognized for so long is due to the fact that they present formidable obstacles to comprehension". He suggests that Abu Salabikh could have been the location of Kesh, however points out that it is not near [[Adab (city)|Adab]] as described and that Kesh could have just been a variation in the spelling of Kish. He discusses how the hymn is preserved for so long in later Nippur texts, saying "Although the Abu Saläbikh copies are approximately eight centuries earlier than copies known before, there is a surprisingly small amount of deviation (except in [[orthography]]) between them. The Old Babylonian version is thus not a creation of Old Babylonian scribes using older material, but is a faithful reflection of a text that had already been fixed in the Sumerian literary tradition for centuries."&lt;ref name="Biggs"&gt;[http://related.springerprotocols.com/lp/de-gruyter/an-archaic-sumerian-version-of-the-kesh-temple-hymn-from-tell-ab-al-b-UDU6yHuFgR Biggs, Robert D., Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und Vorderasiatische, Archäologie , Volume 61 (2), de Gruyter – Jan 1, 1971 - Springerprotocols]&lt;/ref&gt; Biggs suggested "that other traditional works of literature may also go back in essentially their present form to the last third of the third millennium BCE at least."&lt;ref name="Bromiley1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey William Bromiley|title=The International standard Bible encyclopedia, p. 754|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrPYAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1979|publisher=W.B.

==Composition==

Victor Hurowitz referred to it as the "Kesh Temple building hymn" and suggests the [[hymn]] begins with a description and [[Enlil]] praising the city Kesh and its selection and establishment of the [[Ekur]] by Enlil. He also discusses the [[writing]] of the hymn by another god called [[Nisaba]].&lt;ref name="Ramet1996"/&gt; [[Sabrina P. Ramet]] commented on the presence and role of Nisaba (or Nidaba) in the establishment of the temple. She refers to her as the "goddess of vegetation, writing and literature including astronomical texts, the deity of the "house of understanding" (most likely intelligence), and as she who 'knows the (inmost) secrets of numbers'." Nisaba records the events and provides a "standard version" of the events as they really happened.&lt;ref name="Ramet1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabrina P. Ramet|authorlink=Sabrina P.

{{cquote|The princely one, the princely one came forth from the house. Enlil, the princely one, came forth from the house. The princely one came forth royally from the house. Enlil lifted his glance over all the lands, and the lands raised themselves to Enlil. The four corners of heaven became green for Enlil like a garden. Kesh was positioned there for him with head uplifted, and as Kesh lifted its head among all the lands, Enlil spoke the praises of Kesh. Nisaba was its decision-maker; with its words she wove it intricately like a net. Written on tablets it was held in her hands: House, platform of the Land, important fierce [[bull]]!&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

The myth goes on to describe the temple dedication rites and explains that the [[Annanuki]] were the lords of the temple. He suggests that the hymn mentions "objects placed in the temple upon its completion."&lt;ref name="Hurowitz1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor Hurowitz|title=I have built you an exalted house: temple building in the Bible in the light of Mesopotamian and North-West semitic writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qajrNB_7kGMC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=2 June 2011|date=1 June 1992|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-85075-282-0|pages=66, 67, 261}}&lt;/ref&gt; His translation of the introduction reads:

{{cquote|Temple ... Kesh Temple growing up like a mountain embracing the heaven. Growing up like Ekur when it lifted its head in the Land.&lt;ref name="Hurowitz1992"/&gt;}}

The hymn is composed of 134 lines, formally divided into eight songs or "houses" or "temples", each of which ends with three [[rhetorical]] questions discussing the birth of Nintud's warrior son, [[Acgi]]:&lt;ref name="BlackBlack2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-personal.umich.edu/~piotrm/DBtext1.htm Michalowski Piotr., Epics, Hymns, and Letters pp. 248-256 in Jacques Briend and Michel Quesnel, eds., Supplément au Dictionnaire de la Bible, fascicule 72. Paris: Letouzy &amp; Ané, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Will anyone else bring forth something as great as Kesh? Will any other mother ever give birth to someone as great as its hero Acgi? Who has ever seen anyone as great as its lady Nintud?.&lt;ref name="Hurowitz1992"/&gt;}}

Lines one to twenty one describe the election and praise of Kesh as recorded by Nisaba, twenty two to forty four liken the temple to the [[moon]] against the sky containing the life sources of Sumer and its cosmic dimensions filling the world. Lines forty five to fifty seven give a metaphorical description of the temple reaching both for the heaven and descending into the underworld. Lines fifty eight to seventy three discuss the complexities of the temple with vast quantities of oxen and sheep. The temple is likened to the trees from which wood was used in its construction. The gods and functions of the temple are described and praised during temple dedication with different parts of the temple described: its interior and exterior appearance, its gate, courtyard, door and walls. The hymn ends on the conclusion to approach the temple.&lt;ref name="SjobergGragg1969"/&gt;

Wayne Horowitz working from Gragg's translation, discusses the mention of the [[Abzu]] in the myth saying it "occurs as a name for the cosmic waters of the water table beneath the earth's surface in Sumerian literature."&lt;ref name="Horowitz1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne Horowitz|title=Mesopotamian cosmic geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8fl8BXpR0MC&amp;pg=PA308|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1998|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-0-931464-99-7|pages=308–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Temple, great crown reaching heaven. Temple, rainbow reaching heaven. Temple, whose gleam stretches into 'Heaven's Midst', whose foundation is fastened on the Abzu.&lt;ref name="Horowitz1998"/&gt;}}

The latest translation describes its founders, [[geography]] and features:

{{cquote|House founded by [[Anu|An]], praised by Enlil, given an oracle by mother Nintud! ... house, at its upper end a [[mountain]], at its lower end a [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]! House, at its upper end threefold indeed ... Whose well-founded [[granary|storehouse]] is established as a household ... whose terrace is supported by ''lahama'' deities; whose princely great wall ... the shrine of Urim!&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

Barton translated the actions of the Annanuki in and around the temple:

{{cquote|In it their heroes were collected; they were noble. In decisions rendered, the word of all the gods, they rejoiced; The fields, - the sheep and oxen were like an ox of the stall; the [[Cedrus|cedars]] spoke; they were like messengers; The field invited the oxen all of them; The field strengthened the sheep all of them; Their fig-trees on the bank of the boat filled; The weapon the lord, the prince ... lifted up; The luluppi-tree of the wife of the god, the pi-pi-plants of ... In [[hursag]] the [[Garden of the gods (Sumerian paradise)|garden of the god]] were green.&lt;ref name="Barton1918"/&gt;}}

[[Jeremy Black (assyriologist)|Jeremy Black]] suggests the hymn describes the statues of bulls or lions that were placed at the entrances to temples "Kesh temple, &lt;before which&gt; (something) in the shape of winged lions stands, (something) in the shape of 'white' wild bulls stands facing the desert." The hymn discusses music being played at the temple towards the end with drums and the coarse sound of a bull's horn sounding at temple ceremonies: "the wild bull's horn was made to growl, the ''algarsura'' instrument was made to thud."&lt;ref name="BlackBlack1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy Black|author2=Jeremy A.

He proposed that the ''tigi'' was probably a hymn accompanied by [[lyre]], that ''irshemma'' was perhaps one accompanied by a type of [[drum]] and that ''adab'' possibly a hymn accompanied by another form of string instrument.&lt;ref name="Kramer1964"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=The Sumerians: their history, culture and character|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY9xp4pLp88C&amp;pg=PA207|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1964|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-45238-8|pages=207–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hymn finishes with an admonition repeated four times suggested to be both a warning and invocation of the divine presence in the temple. Such ambivalence about approaching temples has crucially influenced the development of [[Jewish]] and [[Christian]] [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://trincoll.academia.edu/SethSanders/Papers/192570/Old_Light_on_Moses_Shining_Face Sanders, Seth L., Old light on Moses' shining face, Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A.R. George suggests such hymns "can be incorporated into longer compositions, as with the eulogy to Nippur and Ekur which makes up a large portion of a well-known [[Hymn to Enlil]] and the hymn to temples in Ur that introduces a [[Self-praise of Shulgi (Shulgi D)|Shulgi hymn]]."&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

==Discussion==

Stephen Langdon suggested the hymn gave evidence of the Sumerian theological view that [[Enlil]] and [[Ninlil]] created mankind and living things. He noted that [[Nintud]], the primary goddess of Kesh was "a form of Ninlil in Nippur : in other words she is Ninlil of Kesh, where her character as goddess of begetting was emphasized." He noted based on an observation of [[Theophilus G. Pinches]], that Ninlil or [[Belit Ilani]] had seven different names (such as Nintud, [[Ninhursag]], Ninmah, etc.) for seven different localities.&lt;ref name="England)1911"&gt;{{cite book|author=Society of Biblical Archæology (London, England)|title=Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, Volume 33, Pl. XI|date=1911|publisher=Society of Biblical Archæology}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the location of Kesh appearing to be near [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] to the east of Babylon calling the temple of Kesh "Ekisigga".&lt;ref name="Babylonian liturgies: Sumerian texts from the early period and from the library of Ashurbanipal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EnheduannaMeador2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Enheduanna|author2=Betty De Shong Meador|title=Princess, priestess, poet: the Sumerian temple hymns of Enheduanna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X3ALAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=2 June 2011|date=1 August 2009|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-71932-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond de Hoop noted similarities between Sumerian temple hymns and chapter forty nine of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in the [[Bible]] ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|49:1-28|HE}}). He suggests remarkably close [[syntactical]] and [[metaphorical]] parallels in the sayings about [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] and [[Judah (biblical person)|Judah]] such as "the highly esteemed prince ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|49:8|HE}}), "a leopard, who seizes prey" ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|49:9|HE}}), "a great wild ox / a wild bull" ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|49:22|HE}}) and " seed of a (the) steer, engendered by a wild ox ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|49:22|HE}}).&lt;ref name="NederlandHoop1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Oudtestamentisch Werkgezelschap in Nederland|author2=Raymond de Hoop|title=Genesis 49 in its literary and historical context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZYHBfzcJ7IC&amp;pg=PA264|accessdate=2 June 2011|date=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10913-1|pages=264–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Black noted that Kesh was no longer a major settlement by the time of the later Babylonian versions but presumed that the temple of Nintud still functioned.&lt;ref name="BlackBlack2006"/&gt; [[Wilfred G. Lambert]] noted that many kings had built temples and chapels to Ninhursag, but that the Kesh sanctuary "was the centre of the goddess's cult from the Early Dynastic period into the Old Babylonian Dynasty; after this time it lost its importance".&lt;ref name="Leick1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwendolyn Leick|title=A dictionary of ancient Near Eastern mythology, p. 132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhnw5olUQXAC|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-19811-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lady Esther''' was the trademark of a cosmetic manufacturing company founded by German-born Syma Cohen and her siblings in [[Chicago]] in 1913 and operated as Lady Esther Company.  It was incorporated in [[Illinois]] in 1922 and became America’s top selling brand of cosmetics in the United States. Its success in large part can be attributed to Syma and her brother Alfred Busiel and their innovative marketing through in-store demonstrations, print advertising and sponsorship of national radio programs. In 1949 Syma Cohen sold her half share in the company to her brother Alfred and following his death the company eventually was sold. Subsequently it had a number of owners. Now a United States company owns the trademark in the United States and a German cosmetic manufacturer owns the business in the rest of the world.

==History==
Syma Cohen began the cosmetics manufacturing business with some of her siblings, including her sister Esther, after whom the company was named. Esther left the business early on and Syma registered the trade name “Lady Esther”, in her name in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevensorchestra.tripod.com|title=STEVENS ORCHESTRA PROJECT|publisher=Stevenorchestra.tripod.com|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sold Lady Esther cream and powder going from home to home and later to drug stores in Chicago and vicinity.  In 1922 she caused the company to be incorporated as “Lady Esther Company” and its name was later changed to “Lady Esther, Ltd.”  The company undertook an aggressive advertising program in newspapers, magazines and by radio on a nationwide basis.  In 1923 it advertised its products at an expense of $143,000.00 with an increase each year, and by 1936 it expended more than 1.5 million dollars.  During those years its sales were in excess of thirty six million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;''Lady Esther, Ltd. v. Lady Esther Corset Shoppe, Inc.'', 317 Il. App. 451, 46 NE 2d 165&lt;/ref&gt;

The company’s first venture into national radio broadcasting was a sponsorship of the Lady Esther serenade featuring Wayne King and his orchestra. The first broadcast was on September 27, 1931 and Wayne King and Lady Esther parted company in 1939-40. The company continued its national broadcasting sponsorship in 1941 with a live CBS Radio series, “[[The Orson Welles Show]]”, which was also known as the “Lady Esther Show”. This was followed by a six season sponsorship of “Lady Esther Presents the [[Screen Guild Players]]”.&lt;ref name="Jim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimramsburg.com/the-waltz-king-audio.html|title=THE WALTZ KING|author=Jim Ramsburg|publisher=Jimramsburg.com|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time the company steadily grew and the owners prospered. It had built a 20,000 square foot facility at 5710 Armitage Avenue in Chicago and in 1933 leased the 65,000 square foot four story and basement plant of the Tinkertoy Company at 2012 Ridge Avenue, Evanston, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune, February 18, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;  

About a year later Syma Cohen purchased a mansion on Sheridan Road in [[Glencoe, Illinois]] for $127,000.00. The house was built on 16.89 acres and contained 19 rooms and 7 baths.  There were elaborate greenhouses and 3 formal gardens. &lt;ref&gt;”Arnstein &amp; Lehr, The First 120 Years”, (Louis A. Lehr, Jr.)(Amazon), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now the location of [[North Shore Congregation Israel]]. 

The popularity of Lady Esther began to wane in the middle 1940s. Other businesses were trying to capitalize on the name and the company became very protective of its trademark. Syma sold her share of the business to Alfred and left the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collectingvintagecompacts.blogspot.com/2013/05/lady-esther-once-most-popular-face.html#!/2013/05/lady-esther-once-most-popular-face.html|title=Collecting Vintage Compacts: The History of The Lady Esther Company - Once The Most Popular Face Powder in America|publisher=Collectingvintagecompacts.blogspot.com|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She traveled extensively throughout the world and later sold the mansion. Her brother Alfred had died in 1951 and the company had numerous owners. Syma Cohen-Busiel moved into a suite in Chicago’s [[Drake Hotel (Chicago)|Drake Hotel]] where she died in 1990 at 99 years of age.  &lt;ref&gt;”Arnstein &amp; Lehr, The First 120 Years”, (Louis A. Lehr, Jr.)(Amazon), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The trademark owners in the United States are now a pharmaceutical wholesale company which has no production facilities.  A German company Lady Esther Kosmetik GMBH is now the trademark owner elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevensorchestra.tripod.com|title=STEVENS ORCHESTRA PROJECT|publisher=Stevenorchestra.tripod.com|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National radio programs==
===Wayne King===
September 27, 1931 – January 25, 1941&lt;ref&gt;''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old Time Radio'' (John Dunning)&lt;/ref&gt;
The first national radio program sponsored by Lady Esther was “The Lady Esther Serenade” featuring [[Wayne King]] and his orchestra. The band’s popularity had been boosted by its recording in 1930 of “[[The Waltz You Saved for Me]]” which became King’s theme song. “The Lady Esther Serenade” was broadcast at least twice a week in primetime on [[CBS]] and/or [[NBC]] and Lady Esther became America’s top-selling brand of cosmetics.&lt;ref name="Jim"/&gt;

===[[The Orson Welles Show]]===
September 15, 1941 – February 2, 1942&lt;ref&gt;“This is Orson Welles” (Orson Welles and [[Peter Bogdanovich]]) Chronology created by Editor Jonathan Rosenbaum&lt;/ref&gt;
The show was also known as the Orson Welles Theater and “Lady Esther Presents Orson Welles.”  It was a variety show featuring Orson Welles and his [[Mercury Theater]] troupe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.old-time.com/otrlogs2/owt_fp.log.txt|format=TXT|title=  O R S O N   W E L L E S   T H E A T E R : (1941 - 1942)|publisher=Old-time.com|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One program in the NBC series has become a suspense classic. [[The Hitch-Hiker]] written by [[Lucille Fletcher]] and starring Orson Welles aired on November 17, 1941. Other programs featured [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[John Barrymore]] and [[Agnes Moorehead]].&lt;ref&gt;“This is Orson Welles” (Orson Welles and [[Peter Bogdanovich]]) Chronology created by Editor Jonathan Rosenbaum&lt;/ref&gt;  Scheduled for 26 weeks the show ended prematurely when Welles left on his ill-fated It’s “All True” trip to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/ladyesther.htm|title=Wellesnet: Orson Welles Show (Lady Esther)|publisher=Wellesnet.com|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[The Screen Guild Theater]]===
October 3, 1942 – July 7, 1947
Lady Esther was looking for a prestigious show to showcase its products and settled on the Screen Guild Theater which had been sponsored by Gulf Oil. It was first known as the “Lady Esther Presents the Screen Guild Players” and then became the Lady Esther Screen Guild Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Screen-Guild.html|title=
The Screen Guild Radio Programs|publisher=Digitaldeliftp.com|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The radio show brought movies to radio for thirty minutes each Monday evening on CBS, Truman Bradley was the announcer and the orchestra was led by Wilbur Hatch.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old Time Radio'' (John Dunning)&lt;/ref&gt;
The show aired for 242 programs beginning with “[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]” starring [[James Cagney]] and ending with “My Reputation.”  In between were all time classics such as “Casablanca” with [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]], “Sergeant York” with [[Gary Cooper]] and “Holiday Inn” with [[Bing Crosby]], [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Dinah Shore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otrsite.com/logs/logs1010htm|title=Old Time Radio|publisher=Otrsite.com|accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leser Landshuth''' (15 January 1817 – 23 March 1887) was a German Jewish liturgiologist.

He went to Berlin as a youth to study Jewish theology, and there he became acquainted with [[Leopold Zunz]] and [[Abraham Geiger]], the latter of whom was then staying in that city in order to become naturalized in [[Prussia]]. Landshuth soon gave up his intention of becoming a [[rabbi]], not being willing to conceal or renounce his liberal opinions; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Moritz Veit|de}} aided him in establishing himself as a Hebrew bookseller.

Meanwhile, Landshuth kept up his literary activity; and in 1845 he published as an appendix to the prayer-book issued by [[Hirsch Edelmann]] ("Siddur Hegyon Leb"; commonly known as "Landshuth's Prayer-Book") an essay on the origin of Hebrew prayers. His essay on the ''[[Pesaḥ Haggadah]]'' (Berlin, 1855) and the introduction to the "Ma'abar Yabboḳ," a handbook of the funeral customs of the Jews, are along similar lines ("{{lang|de|Vollständiges Gebet- und Andachtsbuch zum Gebrauche bei Kranken und Sterbenden}}," Berlin, 1867). A number of inscriptions from the tomb-stones of prominent men are added to the latter work.

Landshuth's chief work was his "{{lang|la|'Ammude ha'Abodah (Columnæ Cultus): Onomasticum Auctorum Hymnorum Hebræorum cum Notis Biographicis et Bibliographicis}}," on Hebrew liturgical poetry (2 vols., ib. 1857–62), a painstaking and important contribution to the subject. No less valuable are his works relating to the history of the Jewish community of Berlin, parts of which have been incorporated in [[Ludwig Geiger]]'s "{{lang|de|Geschichte der Juden in Berlin}}" (ib. 1871); other portions have been published in "Die Gegenwart" (ib. 1867) and other periodicals. He published also "{{lang|yi|Toledot Anshe ha-Shem u-Fe'ulatam}}," history of the Berlin rabbis 1671–1871 (ib. 1884). Many valuable manuscript notes by Landshuth passed into the possession of {{Interlanguage link multi|Salomon Neumann|de}} of Berlin; and other matter was reprinted by {{Interlanguage link multi|Simon Bernfeld|de}} from Landshuth's notes in ''[[Ha-Meliẓ]]'', 1886.

Landshuth also copied and arranged the early communal archives of Berlin (written in Hebrew) and the inscriptions of the old cemetery in that city, which was closed in 1827.

|Montauban is a village about 10 kilometres east of Albert.  It lay close behind the German front-line in 1916 and was strongly fortified. On 1 July 1916, the first day on the Battle of the Somme, the village was seized by the British 30th Division in one of the few successful British advances of the day and in the village there is a memorial to the Liverpool and Manchester 'Pals', who, as part of the 30th Division, were the first to reach the village.  Montauban was to remain free until the end of March 1918, when it was retaken by the Germans in their "Spring Offensive", to be liberated again in August 1918.  This memorial includes the inscription{{Quotation|"To the glorious memory of the Liverpool and Manchester Pals who as part of the 30th Division liberated this village 1 July 1916"}}This is written in English and French.   The memorial stone was unveiled  by Major General Peter Davies, Colonel of the King's Regiment, on 1 July 1994.   On one face the memorial carries the Liverpool Service Battalions' cap badge and on the other that of the Manchester Battalions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmatters.net/txtpat/index.php?id=609 Memorial to the Liverpool and Manchester Pals at Montauban] World War One Website.

|-
|The village of Bouchavesnes, with its neighbour Rancourt, was of great strategic importance given their position on the main Baupaume to Péronne road.   On 12 September 1916, the French Chasseurs Regiment, led by the former Minister of War Messimy, charged and took the German position with fixed bayonets. Their advance was checked the next day following an intense German Artillery bombardment but the French held this line until the end of the Battle of the Somme. They had in fact advanced almost 10 kilometres from their start position at Maricourt on 1 July 1916.    It was the Australians who finally liberated the village on 4 September 1918 .

There is a statue of Foch in the village. Firmin-Marcelin Michelet was the sculptor.

The French Army had done well in their sector and after the opening day they soon took Frise, Hérbecourt and Bernafay Wood as well as Assevillers.  The 1st Colonial Corps took Flaucourt on 19 July and soon threatened Péronne. Biaches was taken then Barleux and the French Foreign Legion took Belloy-en-Santerre.  Soon the plateau of Flaucourt had been conquered but none of these villages were taken without intense fighting and great loss of life    Bianchee for example  was to change hands several times before being finally taken by the French on 19 July 1916.  Once within sight of Péronne however the French had to hold back, conscious that their left flank was exposed given the lack of progress on the British side. Rather than go for Péronne and head further northwards they moved in the direction of Chaulnes.

|File WO 32/5858 held at The National Archives in Kew has information on this memorial to the 46th North Midland Division at Bellenglise which is dedicated to the men who fell on 29 September 1918, when the division attacked the canal between Riquerval Bridge and Bellenglise and broke through the Hindenburg Line taking over 4,000 prisoners and 70 guns.

The file opens on 25 February 1919 when the request to erect the memorial was made. The memorial lies north of St. Quentin near the canal. The land was in fact given free of charge by the owner Monsieur de Chauvenet. The file closes on 5 June 1923.

In the file there is a black-and-white photograph of the memorial and the inscription in English and French. We note that the memorial was sculpted by Harry Neme and Sons of Exeter.  The unveiling took place on 4 October 1922.
There are further memorials to the 46th Division at Vermelles, Gommecourt Wood and at the site of the Hohenzollern Redoubt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ww1cemeteries.com/la-baraque-british-cemetery.html Memorial to the 46th Division at Bellenglise] www.ww1cemeteries.com Retrieved 16 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|Flers is the site of the memorial to the British 41st Division, the memorial featuring a sculpture of a fully equipped British infantry soldier, who faces towards the direction from which the 41st Division attacked.

This memorial was the work of the British sculptor [[Albert Toft]]. On the front of the memorial is inscribed {{Quotation|"To the Glorious Memory of those who fell – 41st British Division 1916–1918"}}The units comprising the Division are then listed below; the 41st Division was a New Army Division and had only arrived in France some four months before their attack at Flers. There are no inscriptions on the sides or back of the memorial plinth, just the sculptor's name. The sculpture of the soldier replicates that which Toft executed for the war memorial at Holborn in London (Memorial to the Royal Fusiliers City of London Regiment).

! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|The New Zealand Memorial at Longueval
|-
|Sited near the South African Memorial at Delville Wood, the New Zealand Memorial at Longueval commemorates the area from which the New Zealand Division started their attack during the Battle of Flers-Courcelette on 15 September 1916, an occasion that saw the first use of tanks in warfare. Along with the British 14th and 41st Divisions,  the New Zealanders entered the reclaimed village of Flers in triumph, preceded by one of the tanks used in the battle.  The memorial itself was unveiled in October 1922.    The Memorial takes the form of a column standing on a projecting base in which are set four panels.   On the front of the column itself are engraved the words{{Quotation|"In Honour of the men of the New Zealand Division. First Battle of the Somme, 1916"}} and the same is engraved in French at the back of the column. On the front panel is an exquisite sculptured design of a Maori carving surrounding the words "New Zealand" .  On the back panel are engraved the words "New Zealand Division, Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury, Otago".  On one side panel is engraved the following sentence{{Quotation||"The New Zealand Division, after gaining this position as their first objective, launched from it the successful attack on Flers, 15th September, 1916"}}and these words are reproduced in French on the other side panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/today/nzmemoriallongueval.htm New Zealand Memorial at Longueval] www.firstworldwar.com.

At the base of the monument is engraved the phrase{{Quotation|"From the uttermost ends of the earth."}}

File WO 32/5867 held at the National Archives in Kew gives us more background information on this memorial. We learn that the land on which this memorial stands was purchased from Vicomte Danger.

==New Zealand Memorial to the Missing at Caterpillar Valley Cemetery==

! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|New Zealand Memorial to the Missing at Caterpillar Valley Cemetery
|-
|This memorial is situated on a terrace in the [[Caterpillar Valley Cemetery]], which lies a short distance west of Longueval, on the south side of the road to Contalmaison. Caterpillar Valley was the name given by the army to the long valley which rises eastwards, past "Caterpillar Wood", to the high ground at Guillemont. The ground was captured, after very fierce fighting, in the latter part of July 1916.   It was lost in the German advance of March 1918 and recovered by the 38th (Welsh) Division on 28 August 1918, when a little cemetery was made (now Plot 1 of this cemetery) containing 25 graves of the 38th Division and the 6th Dragoon Guards.  After the Armistice, this cemetery was hugely increased when the graves of more than 5,500 officers and men were brought in from other small cemeteries, and the battlefields of the Somme. The great majority of these soldiers died in the autumn of 1916 and almost all the rest in August or September 1918. The cemetery now contains 5,569 Commonwealth burials and commemorations of the First World War. 3,796 of the burials are unidentified but there are special memorials to 32 casualties known or believed to be buried among them, and to three buried in McCormick's Post Cemetery whose graves were destroyed by shell fire.  On 6 November 2004, the remains of an unidentified New Zealand soldier were entrusted to New Zealand at a ceremony held at the Longueval Memorial, France.  The remains had been exhumed by staff of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission from Caterpillar Valley Cemetery, Longueval, France, Plot 14, Row A, Grave 27 and were later laid to rest within the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, at the National War Memorial, Wellington, New Zealand.

On the east side of the cemetery is the Caterpillar Valley (New Zealand) Memorial commemorating more than 1,200 officers and men of the New Zealand Division who died in the Battles of the Somme in 1916, and whose graves are not known.

Both cemetery and memorial were designed by Sir Herbert Baker.

==Memorial to the 38th (Welsh) Division at Mametz Wood==
Mametz Wood was to be the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting of the opening days of the Battle of the Somme as taking the wood involved advancing uphill and over open ground whilst facing heavy machine gun fire and artillery. By 12 July the woods had been cleared of Germans but at a heavy cost with over 4,000 Welsh deaths and casualties. The [[Mametz Wood Memorial|Mametz memorial]] takes the form of a Welsh dragon challenging the wood to its fore. At one side of the base is carved the regimental cap badge of the South Wales Borderers. The sculptural work was by David Petersen.

The 38th (Welsh) Division was very much the result of personal initiatives by Lloyd George and was the Welsh equivalent of the "Pals" battalions from the North of England.  So awful was the fighting here that a Welsh soldier, Wyn Griffith, described it as ''"the horror of our way of life and death and of our crucifixion of youth".''

==Australian First Division Memorial at Pozières==
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|Australian First Division Memorial at Pozières
|-
|The fighting in Pozières in 1916 was some of the most ferocious of the war and cost the lives of more Australians in a six-week period than the entire eight months of the Gallipoli campaign.

Pozières sits on a high ridge between the strategically important towns of [[Albert, Somme|Albert]] and [[Bapaume]].   As the highest point on the 1916 Somme battlefield,  the town was a vital objective – whichever side controlled it would have unimpeded views of much of the enemy front. The Allies expected to capture the town (and beyond) on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, but three weeks later it was still firmly in German hands.  Australian troops arrived in the area on 14 July and immediately began preparations to attack Pozières. The town was the bastion of the German defensive line and was protected by the formidable 'K' and 'Pozières' trenches in front of the village and two solid trenches behind, designated 'OG' (Old German) 1 and 2. Before the war a windmill had stood to the north-east of the town; it was destroyed early in the fighting but its foundations had been turned by the Germans into a formidable machine gun post.
[[File:Pozieres Aussie Memorial.jpg|thumb|centre|250px|Plaque on the Australian 1st Division Memorial at Pozières. The Division's Battle Honours are listed]]
The Australian 1st Division and the 48th (South Midland) Division attacked Pozières in the early hours of 23 July 1916 and captured the town after ferocious fighting. The Germans launched several counter-attacks in a desperate effort to wrest control from the Australians, but all were repulsed. The Germans then switched tactics : if they couldn't force the Australians out of Pozieres, they would destroy them. They launched one of the heaviest artillery barrages of the war and pounded the Australians incessantly: at the height of the bombardment the shells rained down at the rate of 20 per minute. After three days the 1st Division had lost 5,285 men and the rest were exhausted. The Division was withdrawn and replaced by the 2nd Division. German pressure remained relentless and after 10 days the 2nd Division had lost 6,848 officers and men. It too was withdrawn and replaced by the 4th Division. This cycle continued until 3 September 1916.    Each Division fought until exhausted and was then replaced. When the replacement Division was itself exhausted, the original Division was rotated back into the line. Thus were the 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions used as a battering ram against the German strong points at Pozières until they were almost destroyed. More than 50% of the Australians who fought at Pozières were killed, wounded or captured and five Victoria Crosses were won by Australians during the relentless fighting.  When entering today's Pozières one is immediately reminded of the Australian's efforts there and one is greeted by a large painting depicting an Australian soldier (See photograph in "Gallery of images"). The memorial itself comprises an obelisk and followed a design that was to be used by the Australians for several of their monuments and a plaque in English and French salutes their achievements and lists their battle honours.

Pozières was retaken by the Germans in their "Spring Offensive" of 1918 and recaptured by the 17th Division on the following 24 August.

==The Tank Memorial at Pozières==

! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|The Tank Memorial at Pozières
|-
|The Tank Corps Memorial is located on the Albert-Bapaume road north-east of Pozières village.

It was in 1919 that the Tank Corps applied for permission to put up a memorial on this site. They proposed to erect a granite obelisk on a plinth with four models of tanks at each of the four corners of the obelisk's base. The proposal was accepted by the British Battle Exploit Memorials Committee and by the French authorities. The memorial was unveiled by Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas L. N. Morland in July 1922.      Two bronze plaques on the memorial are inscribed with the names of battles on the Western Front in France in which the tanks were used from September 1916 to the Armistice in November 1918. {{Quotation|"1916 — 1st Somme— Ancre}}is inscribed on the first plaque with {{Quotation|"1918 —2nd Somme— River Lys— Hamel— Marne — Moreuil— Amiens — Bapaume— Arras— Epephy— Cambrai- St Quintin — Selle — Mormal Forest"}}on the second.

[[File:Pozières monument aux tanks (détail côté accès pylône) 1.jpg|thumb|centre|300px|Base of the Tank Memorial at Pozières. We see two of the four models of tanks displayed on the memorial]]
It was from near the memorial's location that tanks first went into action with the British Army as a new, surprise weapon against the Germans and only a few miles south of this memorial tanks were used at the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]] from 15 to 22 September 1916.

One  interesting feature of the memorial is the boundary "fence" around the obelisk. In the application to build the memorial a fence was suggested as a way of keeping cattle away from the plinth of the memorial and this fence was to comprise ten upright 6 pounder tank gun barrels with tank chains.   The small-scale replicas of some of the tanks used and positioned at the four corners of the memorial are Mark IV and V Heavy tanks and a Mark I Gun-carrier tank and a Medium A Whippet.   From the Tank Memorial there are  excellent views across the battlefields in all directions except back toward Albert as this view is blocked by trees.   However the elevated viewing platform at the 1st Australian Division memorial on the other side of the village can be used for views of Albert.

[[File:Pozières mémorial du Moulin-à-vent 1.jpg|thumb|centre|300px|The Australian Windmill Memorial at Pozières]]
|A rough mound is all that remains of the windmill that stood here for centuries until 1916.  It marks the highest point of the entire Somme battlefield (known as Hill 160).   The Germans converted the ruins of the windmill to a machine gun post and concrete fortifications can still be seen on the mound. Thousands of Australians were killed and wounded in the surrounding fields whilst attempting to capture these formidable defensive positions.   After the war the windmill site was acquired by the Australian Government and now stands as a memorial to the 23,000 Australians who were killed or wounded in the Pozières battle and a stone bench in front of the mound bears the following inscription {{Quotation|"THE RUIN OF POZIERES WINDMILL WHICH LIES HERE WAS THE CENTRE OF THE STRUGGLE IN THIS PART OF THE SOMME BATTLEFIELD IN JULY AND AUGUST 1916. IT WAS CAPTURED ON AUGUST 4TH BY AUSTRALIAN TROOPS WHO FELL MORE THICKLY ON THIS RIDGE THAN ANY OTHER BATTLEFIELD OF THE WAR"}}

The site is flanked by the flags of Australia and France, and two large stones with the insignia of the Australian Imperial Force stand by a walkway which leads to the stone bench.  Behind this is a Ross Bastiaan bronze plaque, similar to those located at other sites of particular significance to the Australian forces.  The plaque, which was unveiled by Lieutenant-General J.C. Grey on 30 August 1993,  gives information about the battle, stating that the Australians went into battle here on 23 July 1916 and fought until they were relieved on 5 September by the Canadians. It also has a relief map of the Somme area.  Behind the bench and bronze plaque is some uneven ground and some concrete remnants can be seen, presumably of the German fortifications on the site of the windmill.

Mouquet Farm (sometimes known as 'Moo-cow' or 'Mucky' Farm) involved much fighting by the Australians and after taking Pozières the Australians fought for a month trying to take Mouquet Farm until they were relieved by the Canadians on 5 September 1916.  The farm was not taken until nearly another month after. The plaque commemorates the AIF's efforts and the 6,300 casualties suffered during ferocious fighting at the site in July–September 1916.

|The [[Pozières Memorial]] to the Missing surrounds the Pozières British Cemetery and covers the period in March and April 1918 when the Allied Fifth Army was driven back by overwhelming numbers across the former Somme battlefields at the time of the German's "Spring Offensive" and the months that followed before the "Advance to Victory" which began on 8 August 1918.    The memorial commemorates over 14,000 casualties of the United Kingdom and 300 of the South African Forces who have no known grave and who died on the Somme from 21 March to 7 August 1918.   Although the memorial surrounds a cemetery with many Australian graves, it does not bear any Australian names; the Australian soldiers who fell in France and whose graves are not known are commemorated on the National Memorial at [[Villers-Bretonneux]].  The cemetery and memorial were designed by [[William Harrison Cowlishaw]] with sculpture by [[Laurence A. Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1208266553 Laurence A.

|-
|The [[Thiepval Memorial]] was designed by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] and is visible for miles around. It stands as a sombre reminder of the many soldiers who lost their lives on the Somme battlefields but who have no known grave. It is 150 feet high and its base measures 123 x 140 feet. On its white stone panels and mounted on sixteen piers are carved the names of over 73,000 soldiers, both British and South African, who were lost in this area between July 1915 and 20 March 1918. These names are given in regimental order and then within each regiment, by rank and name. Soldiers who went missing in this area from 21 March 1918 onwards are commemorated on the nearby Pozieres Memorial.
[[File:Thiepval Memorial to the missing.jpg|thumb|centre|300px|The Thiepval Memorial]]
The memorial does of course record many of the soldiers who died on 1 July, the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Indeed, it is reckoned that 90% of the names recorded were men lost in the 1916 battle. The memorial was built between 1928 and 1932 and unveiled by the Prince of Wales on 31 July 1932.

The memorial also serves as an Anglo-French Battle Memorial in recognition of the joint nature of the 1916 offensive and in the winter of 1932–33 it was decided that a small mixed cemetery would be made at the memorial's foot to represent the losses of both the French and British and Commonwealth Nations. Most of the graves are of unidentified soldiers.

Amongst those remembered at Thiepval are Victoria Cross winners Private William Buckingham, Private William Mariner, T/Captain Eric Norman Frankland Bell, Private William Frederick McFadzean, T/Lieutenant Geoffrey St George Shillington and T/Lieutenant Thomas Orde Lauder Wilkinson.

==Memorial to the Ulster Division at Thiepval==

! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|Memorial to the Ulster Division at Thiepval
|-
|The Ulster Tower Memorial commemorates the men of the 36th (Ulster) Division who fought not only here but in other battles and areas during the war.  It is a copy of Helen's Tower which stands in the grounds of the Clandeboye Estate, near Bangor, County Down in Northern Ireland. Many of the men of the Ulster Division trained in the estate before moving to England and then France early in 1916.
[[File:035 - Ulster Tower, Thiepval, France.jpg|thumb|centre|300px|Memorial to the Ulster Division at Thiepval]]
The Tower is located very near to the famous [[Schwaben Redoubt]] (Feste Schwaben) which the 36th (Ulster) Division were allocated to attack on 1 July 1916. The Schwaben Redoubt was a little to the north-east of where the tower stands, and was a triangle of trenches with a frontage of 300 metres, a fearsome German strongpoint with commanding views.

The tower, which is {{convert|21|m}} high, was unveiled by Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson on 19 November 1921, at a ceremony also attended by French dignitaries. The tower was dedicated by the Primate of All Ireland, the Moderator of the Irish Presbyterian church and the President of the Methodist Church in Ireland. At the time it was described as the most imposing monument on the Western Front; it was certainly one of the earliest. The plaque inside the tower which commemorates the opening, mentions that Lord Carson was initially scheduled to open the memorial but that due to ill-health he could not travel to France for the ceremony. Trees from Ulster were planted here by survivors from the 36th Division.

At the entrance to the site, and on the right hand side, there  is a flagpole flying the Union Jack, whilst on the left is a memorial plaque dedicated to the nine Victoria Cross winners who fought with the 36th (Ulster) Division during the war. This plaque was unveiled in 1951. Of the men commemorated, four won the VC for actions on 1 July 1916; Captain Eric Bell (killed 1 July), Lieutenant Geoffrey Cather (VC awarded for actions on 1 and 2 July, killed 2 July), Private Billy MacFadzean (killed 1 July) and Private Robert Quigg. Robert Quigg survived the War, but was nearly killed ten years after the Battle of the Somme, when in 1926 he fell from a window of the Soldiers Home in Belfast, only narrowly missing being impaled on railings beneath. He eventually died in 1955.

The Inscription on the Memorial reads {{Quotation|"This Memorial is Dedicated to the Men and Women of the Orange Institution Worldwide, who at the call of King and country, left all that was dear to them, endured hardness, faced danger, and finally passed out of the sight of man by the path of duty and self sacrifice, giving up their own lives that others might live in Freedom. Let those who come after see to it that their names be not forgotten"}}

File WO 32/5868 held at The National Archives in Kew gives us further information on the Ulster Division Memorial. The file opens with a letter dated 7 April 1919 from James Craig who writes to the 36th Division Commanding Officer stating that he writes at the request of Sir [[Edward Carson]] to say that over £5000.00 had been subscribed to erect a suitable memorial to the 36th (Ulster) Division. The letter states that Thiepval would be the most favoured site for the memorial.

The file follows progress in erecting the memorial and by November 1919 the idea of the memorial taking the form of a typical "Ulster" tower is being discussed. The file contains an architect's drawing of the proposed tower signed by J.A. Bowden M.S.A. and Major A L Abbot, architects.  We also learn from the file that the tower was built by Messrs. Fenning &amp; Co. Ltd. of Palace Wharf, Rainville Road, Hammersmith. W.6.  We also learn that round the windows of the memorial chamber is inscribed {{Quotation|"Helen's Tower, here I stand/Dominant over sea and land/Son's love built me and I hold/ Ulster's love in lettered gold"}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/somme/ulstertower.html The Ulster Tower] WW1 Battlefields Website.

==The Canadian Memorial at Courcelette==
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|The Canadian Memorial at Courcelette
|-
|The Courcelette Memorial is a Canadian war memorial that commemorates the actions of the Canadian Corps in the final two and a half months of the infamous four-and-a-half-month-long Somme offensive. The Canadians participated at the Somme from early September to the middle of November 1916, engaging in several of the battles-within-the-battle of the Somme, including actions at Flers-Courcelette, Thiepval Ridge and the Ancre Heights, as well as a small role in providing relief to the First Australian Imperial Force in the final days of the Battle of Pozières. The battles on the Somme were the first in which all four Canadian divisions participated in the same battle, although not together in a cohesive formation. The Canadian divisions suffered over 24,000 casualties.

Courcelette is located to the north of the main D929 road between Albert and Bapaume and at the beginning of the Somme Battles in July 1916 it was well within German held territory (see map above).   Indeed, it was not until mid-September that the Allies reached Courcelette and on 15 September 1916, the offensive which was to be known as the Battle of Flers-Courcelette was launched.  It was fought on a wide front with the Canadians playing a major role and involved the first use of tanks.  After Courcelette's capture it remained near to the front lines until the Germans withdrew to the Hindenburg Line early in 1917.   In the German's "Spring Offensive" they retook Courcelette on 25 March 1918 and five months later it was retaken by the British as they advanced in the final few months of the War.
[[File:Monument courcelette.JPG|thumb|centre|350px|Memorial at Courcelette]]
The memorial is set within a small park and the inscription commemorates the Canadians part in breaking the German lines from 3 September to 18 November 1916. It reads {{Quotation|"THE CANADIAN CORPS BORE A VALIANT PART IN FORCING BACK THE GERMANS ON THESE SLOPES DURING THE BATTLES OF THE SOMME 3rd SEPT. – 18th NOV. 1916"}}

There are a number of cemeteries near Courcelette. To the west of the village is Courcelette British Cemetery, originally known as Mouquet Road or Sunken Road Cemetery and to the north lies the Adanac Military Cemetery.   Regina Trench crossed the road a little to the south of the cemetery, and Courcelette Trench ran on the other side of the road from the cemetery.  A Maple Leaf motif attached to the cemetery gates denotes the Canadian associations of this cemetery, the name being 'Canada' spelt backwards.  Over 3,000 are buried here, around a third of whom are Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/pages/somme/courcelette.html The Canadian Memorial at Courcelette] WW1 Battlefields.

|-
|The villages of Ovillers and La Boiselle are located either side of the main Albert-Bapaume road.  Ovillers (which is properly known as Ovillers la Boiselle) lies to the north of the road, and La Boiselle to the south. On 1 July 1916, both villages were just behind the German front lines. The attacks here on 1 July were made by the 34th Division, with the 8th Division to their north in front of Ovillers. They met with little success, and casualty rates in the attacking battalions were extremely high. A [[Mines on the first day of the Somme|number of mines]] were blown along the Somme front line and before the infantry went "over the top" and here two large mines were blown two minutes before the infantry attacked; at Lochnagar and Y Sap. The crater made at Y Sap has since been filled in, and no trace remains but Lochnagar crater remains as one of the best known sites in the 1916 Somme battlefield region. At Lochnagar it is possible to walk all around the edge of the crater left by the explosion, but access to the crater itself is not permitted. Two charges of ammonal ({{convert|36000|lb|disp=flip}} and {{convert|24000|lb|disp=flip}} {{convert|20|m|ft}} apart) had been set off under a German position called Schwaben Hohe, and the crater originally measured some {{convert|100|m|-2}} across and {{convert|30|m|-1}} deep.

|-
|The Tyneside Memorial Seat, a memorial to the 102nd and 103rd Tynside Infantry Brigades was unveiled by Foch on 20 April 1922 and commemorates the Tyneside Scottish and Tyneside Irish Brigades' efforts to capture the ground either side of La Boisselle.
This memorial comprises a seat and bears a central plaque depicting a classical mounted warrior battling a dragon, whilst a weeping maiden looks on. There is also an inscription which reads {{Quotation|"Greater love hath no man than this that he lay down his life for his friend. In front of this monument on 1/7/16 the 'Tyneside Scottish' and the 'Tyneside Irish' brigades attacked the enemy. For many hours the fortunes of arms fluctuated but ere night had fallen the two Tyneside Brigades with the aid of other units of the 34th Division attained their objective. Think not that the struggle and the sacrifice were in vain"}}The motifs of the two Brigades, officially the 102nd and 103rd Brigades, are displayed on the pillars flanking either side of the seat.

File WO 32/5954 held at the National Archives in Kew covers this memorial and we learn that an application for approval of the memorial being erected was made on 4 September 1919 and that it was intended to replace the existing wooden cross of the 102nd Infantry Brigade, which it was agreed, in a splendid turn of phrase, "be abandoned to the processes of nature".

The Tyneside Scottish and Irish battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers were formed in 1914. The Tyneside Scottish were the 20th to 23rd Battalions and formed part of the 102nd Brigade, 34th Division. The Tyneside Irish were the 24th to 27th Battalion, and part of 103rd Brigade in the same division.

Both Brigades were committed to the attack on La Boisselle on 1 July 1916, some elements of the Tyneside Irish attacking up Mash Valley, and the bulk of the Tyneside Scottish advancing from Tara Hill down into Avoca Valley. Casualties were very heavy.  The Tyneside Scottish Brigade lost 2,324 officers and men, and the Tyneside Irish Brigade 1,968. Losses among senior officers were particularly heavy, with all four battalion commanders in the Tyneside Scottish Brigade being killed.  In the Tyneside Irish Brigade the Brigade commander was wounded and three of the four battalion commanders were killed or wounded. The Tyneside memorial is on the western edge of the village of La Boiselle.

|This memorial comprises a stone cross, with a butterfly on the top, the butterfly being the emblem of the Division. The 19th Division  had attacked La Boiselle in the early morning on 2 July 1916, and managed to take most of the village, although the Germans still held a line that ran through the church.    The inscription at the top reads {{Quotation|"Butterfly/To the Glorious memory/Of the soldiers of the 19th Western Division/Who fell in action in the battle of the Somme/Between July 2nd and November 20th 1916/La Boisselle — Bazentin le Petit — Grandcourt"}} and shows that the memorial commemorates not only the attack on 2 July 1916, but also the actions of the 19th Division throughout the remainder of the Somme battles that year, up until 20 November. As well as La Boiselle, the names Bazentin-le-Petit (where the Division fought on 23 July) and Grandcourt (where the Division withdrew on 19 November, right at the end of the Somme campaign) are listed. On the base of cross are listed the units which made up the 19th Division; on the front these cover the Artillery, Engineers, Pioneers, RAMC and RASC, and on the other three sides the battalions of the three infantry brigades, the 56th, 57th &amp; 58th.

==The 34th Division Memorial at La Boiselle==

|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|The 34th Division Memorial at La Boiselle
|-
|Not far from the 19th Division Memorial is the 34th Division memorial. This is in the form of the figure of Victory, on a stone plinth, originally holding up a laurel wreath. This memorial was unveiled on 23 May 1923, by Major-General Sir Cecil Nicholson, who had commanded the Division from 25 July 1916 until the end of the war (he had taken over after Major-General Ingouville-Williams was killed).

The 34th Division's Memorial commemorates the part that the 34th Division had in the heavy fighting in and around the area of La Boisselle in July 1916.  The 34th Division had been raised as part of Kitchener's New Army and the Somme was to be their first battle. Formed for the most part by men from Tyneside it also had two battalions of Royal Scots from Edinburgh (One of which, the 16th was the footballers' battalion). As part of the great offensive on 1 July 1916, the 34th Division's task was to advance towards Contalmaison – the next village – taking La Boiselle, the Schwaben Höhe (Site of the Lochnagar Crater), Sausage Valley and the Sausage Redoubt.   The attacks were met by a hail of fire from German defenders who had been waiting out the week-long bombardment in their shelters.  By the evening when the 19th Division took over the front line, Schwaben Höhe and a foothold on the Sausage Redoubt were the only gains that had been made. La Boisselle was still very much in German hands.

The memorial then features a bronze figure of "Victory" atop a plinth and incorporates the Division's chequerboard emblem.  The memorial is said to be located where the Divisional HQ stood in 1916. The Division's units are listed on the side panels; infantry on the left and artillery and engineers on the right. The inscription commemorates the 34th Division (which included the Tyneside Scottish &amp; Irish Brigades referred to earlier, see the Tyneside Memorial Seat). The memorial records that the Division was engaged for the first time in battle near this spot on 1 July 1916. All 12 infantry battalions of the Division were to be involved, in successive waves. In around 10 minutes nearly 80% of the men in the leading battalions had become casualties; mainly caused by German machine-guns. These, once the British barrage lifted, were able to sweep across No Man's Land (often wide here) and catch the advancing soldiers in the open.

There was some success on the extreme right of the 34th Division frontage on 1 July, but in front of Ovillers and la Boiselle the only gains came in between Lochnagar and La Boiselle, where the 21st, 22nd and 26th Northumberland Fusiliers (the first two battalions from 102nd Brigade, the last from 103rd Brigade) started to advance the moment the [[Lochnagar crater|mine at Lochnagar]] was blown.  The troops took German trenches to the north and north-east of Lochnagar crater, around Schwaben Hohe and on the northern slopes of Sausage Valley.  However, there were no reinforcements for the Divisional Commander, Major-General Ingouville-Williams, to deploy, and so the 19th Division were detailed to carry out an attack on La Boiselle after dark. They successfully took the village early the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmatters.net/txtpat/index.php?id=143 The 34th Division Memorial at La Boiselle] www.webmatters.net. Retrieved 13 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Ovillers is the village to the north of the D929.   From the main road, there is a good view of the large Ovillers Military Cemetery. This contains the burials of nearly 3,500 soldiers, only 31% of which are identified burials.  The cemetery is located in what was No Mans Land, and from the front of the cemetery, where a bank slopes down to the road, there are clear views of the Albert basilica to the right, of Mash valley in front, and the main road running on the spur ahead. [[Charles Carrington (British Army officer)|Charles Edmonds]], returning across this area on 16 July described it in "A Subaltern's War" {{Quotation|"A little grass had still room to grow between the shellholes. The village was guarded by tangle after tangle of rusty barbed wire in irregular lines. Among the wire lay rows of khaki figures, as they had fallen to the machine-guns on the crest, thick as the sleepers in the Green Park on summer Sunday evening........the flies were buzzing obscenely over the damp earth; morbid scarlet poppies grew scantily along the white chalk mounds; the air was tainted with rank explosives and the sickly stench of corruption"}}

The cemetery was originally only a single plot, Plot 1, located a little back from the front right of the cemetery. This was started around August 1916, and used until March 1917. It was then quite small, less than 150 graves, but the cemetery was increased significantly after the Armistice. This was mainly as a result of bringing in bodies from the local battlefields of Ovillers, La Boiselle, Pozières and Contalmaison. This explains the high number of unidentified burials located here.&lt;ref name="LaBoiselle" /&gt;

! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|Serre Road
|-
|[[Serre-lès-Puisieux|Serre]] was not the place to be in 1914–18 and lest we had any doubts of this the approach to the village sees Serre Road Cemetery No.2 on the left and Serre Road Cemetery No.1 on the right but not before we see the mass of graves in the French Serre-Hébuterne Cemetery.  No sooner have we absorbed this do we come across a rather forlorn little memorial to the York and Lancasters.

In 1916 Serre was to be hell for the British and Allied Armies, but the French had already seen many deaths there in the actions of 1915.

In the village of Serre itself is the memorial to the 31st Division which consisted of Pals' battalions drawn from Leeds, Bradford, Barnsley, Sheffield, Durham and Accrington.   The 31st Division were charged with taking the village and when they "went over the top" they were soon to lose over 5,000 men.   Nearby is [[Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt|Hawthorn Ridge]] where a 45,000 pound [[ammonal]] mine was blown on 1 July 1916, one of the many detonations before the attack started which it was hoped would distract the Germans.

The Accrington Pals,  officially the 11th Battalion East Lancashire Regiment, were  part of the 31st Division. They had served in Egypt in 1915/16, and then came to the Somme in the Spring of 1916 taking over the trenches opposite Serre.    At 7.30am on 1 July 1916 they were in the first wave of the attack from Mark Copse, and although they suffered heavily crossing No Man's Land, elements of the battalion under the commanding officer, Lt-Col Rickman, did reach the German lines.    By the close of the day, however, they were forced back and had lost 584 officers and men out of 720 who had made the attack that morning. The Memorial was erected in the 1980s in the Sheffield Memorial Park, just behind one of the jumping off trenches from where the Accrington Pals advanced on 1 July. It is made from Accrington brick, and the ruined wall symbolises the ruined village of Serre.

The British 31st Division was a New Army division formed in April 1915 as part of the K4 Army Group and taken over by the War Office on 10 August 1915. The division comprised mainly battalions from Yorkshire and Lancashire.

|Delville Wood was sometimes known as Devil's Wood, and the fighting there during the battle of the Somme was particularly ferocious and involved countless deaths. The majority of the wood was eventually taken by South African soldiers on 15 July 1916, and they held on grimly during numerous German counterattacks for six days, until they were relieved. The fighting went on until 3 September 1916.
[[File:Delville Wood South African National Memorial (September 2010) 3.JPG|thumb|centre|300px|The South African Memorial at Delville Wood]]
In 1920, South Africa purchased the site considering it an ideal location for their [[Delville Wood South African National Memorial|National Memorial]] and it serves as a memorial to all those South Africans who gave their lives not only in the 1914–1918 war but also the Second World War and the [[Korean War]].  Delville Wood is located off the D20 that runs between Longueval  and Guillemont.   Opposite the South African Memorial there is a large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery, the Delville Wood Cemetery. This is the third largest British cemetery on the Somme, with 5,523 graves. Almost all the burials are of casualties from the Somme during the period July, August and September 1916 and a high proportion of the bodies could not be identified.

The memorial was unveiled in 1926 and its imposing entrance is surmounted by a statue of a horse and two men. This was based on the legend of Castor and Pollux and is an allegory representing the fact that both English South Africans and Boers had fought side by side.  The names of areas where South Africans fought, including locations in France and Flanders, are inscribed on the memorial, and above the entrance arch are the words {{Quotation|"Their ideal is our legacy, their sacrifice our inspiration"}}

The sculptor [[Alfred Turner (sculptor)|Alfred Turner]] was selected by Sir Herbert Baker to execute the Castor, Pollux and Horse sculpture and this led to his participation in the Cape Town and Pretoria War Memorials which used the same Castor and Pollux work. A plaster cast of "Dioscuri", the title of Turner's work, was shown in the forecourt of Burlington House in 1925 before the bronze was despatched to France the next year and unveiled on 10 October 1926 by the widow of General Botha. Two full-size bronze replicas went to South Africa in April 1928, one being erected in front of Capitol Buildings in Pretoria and the other in Cape Town. A bronze model was also placed in the Queen's Hall of the South African Houses of Parliament. 10 October was chosen as the unveiling date for the Delville Wood memorial as this was the date in 1899 when the first shot was fired in the South African War and the date in 1908 of the National Conference which brought the Union of South Africa into being.    In file TGA 8713.1.7 at [[Tate Britain]] Archive there is a copy of the unveiling ceremony programme of Sunday 10 October 1926. This describes the bronze sculpture as follows {{Quotation|"The stone dome which crowns the monument supports a group in bronze of two men representing Physical Energy and the two races of South Africa, between them leading a war horse into battle, and with one hand clasped over the horse's back. The group was inspired by the Greek sculpture of the twin gods Castor and Pollux and their horses guarding the steps of the Capitol at Rome, and by the legend of the great twin brethren who came overseas to fight in the ranks of Rome"}}Also in the Archives are file TGA 8713.1.8.

This is a memorial to those who died, rather than to those with no known grave.  Those South Africans whose bodies were never identified and were listed as "missing" are inscribed on the Thiepval Memorial and other "Memorials to the Missing".

Behind the memorial is a museum. This is relatively new, with a stone laid on 7 June 1984 to commence building work and the building itself was opened on 11 November 1986, by Mr. P.W. Botha.   In the "Gallery of Images" at the end of this entry there is a photograph of the plaque which commemorates this opening.

The museum is hexagonal in structure, and inside are four large bronze panels on the outer walls. The first (to the left from the entrance) contains 16 friezes depicting various aspects of the 1914–1918 war, whilst the next is devoted to the particular actions at Delville Wood in the six days from 14 to 20 July 1916. The third bronze also deals with the 1914–1918 war, whilst the fourth covers the Second World War. Several of the inner walls contain large windows, and etched on the glass are the battle honours of the South African forces.

Both the memorial and the museum stand within the re-grown wood, and it is possible to walk along the same "rides" or tracks that used to exist before and during the war. In the spirit of the time, these were given street names by the soldiers who fought here. For example, there are a number of London street names, such as Rotten Row, whilst others such as Princes Street and Buchanan Street suggest a link with Edinburgh. A photograph of one such "marker" is included in the "Gallery of Images". Also included is a photograph of an obelisk which marks the battle Headquarters of the South Africans during the Delville Wood action. To the left rear of the museum is what is believed to be the last original tree to survive from before the war. This is marked by a plaque. The tree is a hornbeam and is situated near the  Prince's Street-Regent Street intersection, behind the Museum.

The Battle of Delville Wood was fought from 14 July to 3 September 1916.  General Douglas Haig, Commander of the British Expeditionary Force planned to secure the British right flank, while the centre advanced to capture the higher lying areas of High Wood in the centre of his line and the Delville Wood battle was part of this effort to secure that right flank.

The battle is of particular importance to South Africa, as it was the first major engagement entered into by the South African 1st Infantry Brigade on the Western Front. The casualties sustained by this Brigade were of catastrophic proportions, comparable to those encountered by Allied battalions on the first day of the Somme. On the Western Front, units were normally considered to be incapable of combat if their casualties had reached 30% and they were withdrawn once this level had been attained. The South African Brigade suffered losses of 80%, yet they managed to hold the Wood as ordered.

The first major objective was to capture [[Longueval]] from the Germans but before this could be attempted the Allies had to first clear [[Trônes Wood]] as this posed a danger to their right flank as they approached Longueval from the south.  They also knew that they would have to take Delville Wood which bordered the north eastern edge of Longueval as unless this was done Longueval would be difficult to hold as the wood could be used by German artillery to shell Longueval and would also provide ideal cover for the Germans to assemble reinforcements for a counterattack.

To achieve this the 9th Scottish Division were to attack Longueval and the 18th Eastern Division under Major General Ivor Maxse on their right were to clear Trônes Wood. The Division Commander of the 9th Scottish Division, Major-General W.T. Furse ordered that the Longueval attack be led by the 26th Brigade.   The 8th Black Watch and the 10th Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders would lead,  the  9th Seaforth Highlanders would provide support and the 5th Cameron Highlanders would be in reserve. The 27th Brigade would follow, mopping up any bypassed German elements and providing support for the intense fighting which was expected once the leading battalions had entered the fortified town. Once the town had been secured, the 27th Brigade was to pass through the 26th to take Delville Wood. The 1st South African Brigade was to be kept in reserve.

The offensive started at 0325 on 14 July and on a 4 miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) front but after fierce fighting it became clear to Major-General Furse that to secure Longueval, Delville Wood had to be taken first and as heavy losses were already being incurred he found that he had to commit the 1st South African Brigade to the fray.  Furse ordered Brigadier General [[Henry Lukin]] to deploy his 1st South African Brigade to advance and to capture Delville Wood.

The battle raged for several days, often with hand-to-hand fighting and with both sides incurring heavy losses.  Throughout this period the German artillery pounded the wood from their positions in and around Longueval.  In his 1983 book Ian Uys "Delville Wood" he quotes a German officer's words {{Quotation|"Delville Wood had disintegrated into a shattered wasteland of shattered trees, charred and burning stumps, craters thick with mud and blood, and corpses, corpses everywhere. In places they were piled four deep. Worst of all was the lowing of the wounded. It sounded like a cattle ring at the spring fair"}}

The final German forces were driven from the wood on 3 September 1916 although the South Africans had been withdrawn at an earlier date.   The Allies held the Wood until April 1918 when it was again re–captured by German forces during the "Spring Offensive" and held by them until 28 August 1918. On this day the 38th (Welsh) Division captured the wood for the second and last time. The war was to end three months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delvillewood.com/wood.htm Delville Wood] www.delvillewood.com. Retrieved 14 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

|The British 20th (Light) Division was a New Army division formed in September 1914 as part of the K2 Army Group. The division landed in France in July 1915 and spent the duration of the war in action on the Western Front.  The division fought at Loos, Mount Sorrel, Guillemont, Flers-Courcelette, Morval. Le Transloy, Messines and at Third Ypres and the Battle of Cambrai. The memorial shown here stands at Guillemont near to Delville Wood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/order-of-battle-of-divisions/20th-light-division/ 20th Light Division] www.1914–1918.net.

[[File:20th Light Division.jpg|thumb|centre|300px|Memorial to the 20th Light Division at Guillemont on the Somme]]

Guillemont was a village to see much fighting in the Battle of the Somme.  The Germans held on to Guillemont with great tenacity and after major attacks on 30 July and on 8 August, the village was finally taken on 3 September 1916. The 20th (Light) Division was instrumental in taking the village, one of the reasons for the choice of location,  although there is another 20th Light Division Memorial at Langemarck in Flanders.    The 16th (Irish) Division took nearby Ginchy on 9 September and there is a memorial to them near Guillemont. See below.

This memorial is on the linas which was the Division's target when they attacked on 3 September 1916. The road running north-south (which forms the cross-roads with the D20) was taken, as their third objective.

The 20th Division Memorial is in fact a replacement of the original memorial.   The original, a tapering stone obelisk, was unveiled on Sunday 4 June 1922, by Major-General Sir Cameron Shute (who had commanded the 59th Brigade of the 20th Division during the Guillemont actions). He was accompanied by the Mayor of Guillemont and a French Army representative (General Douchy), plus men who had fought with the Division at Guillemont. The original memorial was similar in appearance to the same Division's memorial in Flanders, which was unveiled five years after that at Guillemont. The Flanders memorial can still be seen today at Langemarck. The replacement memorial here at Guillemont was unveiled on 25 April 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/pages/somme/guillemont.html Guillemont] WW1 Battlefields.

After the war, Guillemont was 'adopted' by Hornsey, and in September 1921 a deputation from Hornsey visited the village and gave them a tractor, a threshing machine and a plough to help the villagers with their restoration of the devastated land.

|One of the best-known graves in this cemetery is that of Lieutenant [[Raymond Asquith]], son of [[H. H. Asquith]], who was Prime Minister at the time of his son's death on 15 September 1916. An obituary in ''The Times'' four days later recorded the loss of 'a man of brilliant promise'. He was a lawyer, and also following his father into politics (he was the prospective Liberal candidate for Derby) when the war broke out. Although already in his mid-thirties, he applied for a commission, and served initially in the Queens Westminsters, then the Grenadier Guards. He had applied to return to the frontline from a staff position shortly before he fought and died near here, and was obviously a brave and intelligent man. So the War, which is said to have touched most families in Britain, touched the lives of the Prime Minister, who lost his eldest son, and Raymond Asquith's own family. He left a wife and three children. From the cemetery there are good views across to the village church, and also Longueval church can be seen further in the distance. The buildings on the site of Guillemont Station can also be seen, and Trônes Wood is visible to the left.

|This memorial is a little further along the D64 past Guillemont Road Cemetery.   The name  Trônes Wood was actually a misspelling; the French name (then and today) is Bois de Troncs. There was an attempt to take the Wood from the Germans on 8 July 1916, and on 14 July 18&amp;nbsp;Division was successful in doing so.
[[File:Trones Wood Battle July 1916.jpg|thumb|centre|350px|Military artist drawing of battles in Trônes Wood: 14 July 1916]]
At one time, there was an 18th Division memorial at Trônes Wood in the form of a wooden cross.   However, today a memorial to the 18th Division, found on the edge of the wood by the road, is one of the early permanent British memorials in the Somme. It comprises a tall obelisk, and the main inscription reads {{Quotation|"To the Glory of God and in imperishable memory of the officers, NCOs and men of the 18th Division who fell fighting for the sacred cause of liberty in the Somme battles of 1916 and 1918"}}Underneath are the words "The greatest thing in the world", and below that a quotation from John Chapter 25 Verse 12, a quotation which is also seen on other memorials.

Representatives from the Guards, and from the French military were also present, as was the Earl of Cavan, who had commanded the 14th Corps of which the Guards Division was a part. Not far away and as the road drops down towards Lesboeufs is the Guards Cemetery. This is one of three with the name "Guards Cemetery" on the Western Front; the other two are at Combles and at Cuinchy. The cemetery is above the level of the road, with a bank and wall with entrance steps at the front.  The cemetery was originally a wartime one; and the early burials are mainly of Grenadier Guards who fell in the area on 25 September 1916, which was when the Guards Division took the nearby village of Lesboeufs. It was a small cemetery, with only 40 graves, but after the Armistice it was increased in size, and now contains 3,136 graves.   As with Guillemont Road Cemetery  less than half of the graves contain remains that were identified.

Combles is around two miles east of Guillemont, and was taken on 26 September 1916, after the Germans evacuated it the night before. Here is another 'Guards Cemetery' as mentioned above.

|The 16th and 18th (Service) Battalions of the Prince of Wales Own West Yorkshire Regiment 1914–1918 were part of what was known as "The Bradford Pals".

[[File:Bradford Pals.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Memorial to Bradford Pals]]

The tiny village of Hébuterne has a plaque on its church wall commemorating the Bradford Pals. The location was chosen because it is close to where 44 Pals were killed in woodland, but it is a couple of kilometres (miles) distant from Serre where the majority of them were mown down on 1 July 1916.

The Bradford Pals had close associations with Bradford City Football Club and both battalions were admitted free to Valley Parade, the Bradford City ground, in the days leading up to their departure from Bradford. Their initial meetings took place at the Drill Hall right next to the ground and undoubtedly many of them will have been supporters of the Bradford City players Speirs, Torrance et al.

Indeed, among the ranks of the Pals was none other than City's most famous player, the England international winger Dickie Bond, and fortunately he survived the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030356/http://www.bantamspast.co.uk/index.php?id=913231549983316006 Memorial to Bradford Pals] Bradford City Website.

There is a church alongside the cemetery and a small chapel on the other side of the road.  This memorial chapel, built of dressed stone, was not the result of any official initiative but was funded by the du Bos family, originally from this region, who wished to commemorate their son and his comrades who were killed in action on 25 September 1916.

Today Rancourt has the dubious privilege of hosting three military cemeteries, one French, one British, and German. It is also the key site for the commemoration of French participation in the Battle of the Somme.
[[File:Rancourt Cemetery.jpg|thumb|centre|350px|Marker in Rancourt German Cemetery recording that 11,422 men are buried there]]
There are only a few graves here from the early months of the war. Two thirds of the dead lying here are from the Battle of the Somme between July and November 1916. Most of the remainder are from the summer of 1918.

In 1929 repairs were carried out following negotiations with the French Government and the mass graves were given a proper wall and planted with roses. Trees were planted and the cemetery was inaugurated on 17 September 1933.

The problem of how to mark the names of the fallen had to wait until the end of the Second World War for a solution and eventually in 1972 the wooden crosses were replaced with crosses made from Belgian granite.

There are two mass graves containing the remains of 7,492 soldiers of whom only 2,316 could be identified.

A small chapel made from red Vosges sandstone lies within the cemetery and inside is an entombment carved by Geiger the Munich sculptor.

|The [[Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial]] stands within Villers-Bretonneux Military Cemetery. Villers-Bretonneux became famous in 1918, when the German advance on Amiens ended in the capture of the village by their tanks and infantry on 23 April. On the following day, the 4th and 5th Australian Divisions, with units of the 8th and 18th Divisions, recaptured the whole of the village and on 8 August 1918, the 2nd and 5th Australian Divisions advanced from its eastern outskirts in the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]].
[[File:Villers-Bretonneux mémorial australien (tour et croix) 1.jpg|thumb|centre|350px|Villers-Bretonneux]]
The memorial was erected to commemorate all Australian soldiers who fought in France and Belgium during the First World War, to their dead, and especially to name those of the dead who remains were not identified or who were listed as "Missing".

Both the cemetery and memorial were designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and the memorial was unveiled by King George VI on 22 July 1938.

There are now 10,762 Australian servicemen officially commemorated by this memorial and named within the register.

The Villers-Bretonneux memorial was badly damaged in the course of the 1939–1945 War and file WO 219/922 held at The National Archives in Kew gives information on the damage sustained.

Villers-Bretonneux is a sacred place for Australians and marks one of the seminal moments when the German's eventual defeat was started.

The central arch of the memorial bears the crest of the Australian Imperial Force. The inscription, in French and English, reads {{Quotation|"To the Glory of God and the Memory of the Australian Imperial Force in France and Flanders 1916–1918 and of eleven thousand who fell in France and have no known grave."}}

|It was at Beaumont Hamel that the Newfoundland Regiment and others attacked the German position known as "Y Ravine" and within minutes lost 710 men to the German Machine Gun located there. By nightfall 14,000 men were lost forever. The Memorial to the 51st Highland Division stands at the point where the Scots took the German line in November 1916.

The [[Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial|Newfoundland Memorial Park]] at [[Beaumont Hamel]]  stands in land which was purchased by the Dominion of Newfoundland after the First World War. It was named after the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, which had provided one battalion of 800 men to serve with the British and Commonwealth Armies.  The park remembers their tragic part in the action of 1 July 1916, and also serves as a memorial to all the Newfoundlanders who fought in the First World War, most particularly those who have no known grave.

The Newfoundland Memorial Park was opened on 7 June 1925 by Field Marshal Earl Haig.   Newfoundland became a province of Canada in 1949 and the park is one of only two Canadian National Historic Sites outside Canada. The other National Historic Site is also in France at Vimy Ridge. The landscape architect for the design of the park was R H K Cochius.

At the entrance to the park there is a bronze plaque with the following words inscribed on it {{Quotation|"Tread softly here! Go reverently and slow here./Yea, let your soul go down upon its knees/And with bowed head and heart abased strive hard/To grasp the future gain in this sore loss!/ For not one foot of this dank sod but drank/ Its surfeit of the blood of gallant men/Who, for their faith, their hope,—for Life and Liberty/ Here made the sacrifice,—here gave their lives/ And gave right willingly—for you and me/From this vast altar—pile the souls of men/Sped up to God in countless multitudes:/On this grim cratered ridge they gave their all/ And, giving, won/The peace of Heaven and Immortality/Our hearts go out to them in boundless gratitude/ If ours—then God's: for His vast charity/All sees, all knows, all comprehends—save bounds/He has repaid their sacrifice:—and we—?/God help us if we fail to pay our debt/n fullest full and unstintingly!"}}These are words written by John Oxenham (1852–1941) as a Memorial to the 29th Division.

On the morning of 1 July 1916, as the Battle of the Somme began, the 29th Division was in action on the British Front Line in the location which is now Newfoundland Memorial Park. The division suffered a high number of casualties as a result of the success of the German defence in this sector. Many were cut down before they got anywhere near the German Front Line. Many were killed and wounded as they moved forward from the rear of the Front Line to follow on in the attack.

The 29th Division was formed in the United Kingdom between January and March 1915. In mid March it was sent to Egypt, from where it sailed to take part in the Gallipoli Campaign, landing at Cape Helles on 25 April 1915. After 8 months of fighting in the Gallipoli Peninsula the 29th Division left Gallipoli on 7 and 8 January 1916, as part of the secret, silent evacuation of British troops from this fighting front.  After a few weeks in Egypt the Division was ordered to move to the Western Front.

Passing through the Mediterranean port of Marseilles the 29th Division arrived in the rear of the Somme battle front from 15 to 29 March 1916. From this time the Division was put into the British Front in the area north of the Ancre River, near to the German-held village of Beaumont Hamel. For the following three months the battalions in the Division spent their time doing tours of trenches and training behind the lines to prepare for the large British offensive against the German position planned for the end of June.

Following a 7-day artillery bombardment of the German Front and Rear areas, the battalions of the 29th Division were in position in their Assembly Trenches in the early hours of Saturday 1 July. At 07.20 hours the huge [[Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt|Hawthorn mine]] was blown on the left of the division's position. The leading battalions in the attack left the British Front Line trench at 07.30 hours.

The Caribou memorial is one of 5 such memorials on the Western Front which commemorate the location where the 1st Battalion of the Newfoundland Regiment was in action. The caribou is the emblem of the Newfoundland Regiment. The sculptor of the bronze caribou was an Englishman called [[Basil Gotto]]

The Caribou Memorial is situated on the high ground at the western side of the park, behind the British July 1916 Front Line, from where the 1st Battalion the Newfoundland Regiment began its advance on 1 July 1916.   The shrubs around the rocks are native plants from Newfoundland.

At the base of the Caribou there are three bronze panels listing 814 names for the Memorial to the Newfoundlanders Missing. These are Newfoundlanders who died on land and at sea in the First World War and who have no known graves.

The other Caribou memorials are at Geudecourt near Bapaume, Harelbeke near Courtrai, Masnières near Cambrai and Monchy-le-Preux, near Arras.

There are three cemeteries in the memorial park, the Hawthorn Ridge Cemetery No. 2, Hunter's Cemetery and Y Ravine Cemetery.

The 51st (Highland) Division Memorial is also located in the park as it was on 13 November 1916 that the village of Beaumont Hamel was attacked and captured by the 51st (Highland) Division. This memorial was unveiled in 1924 and is a sculptured statue of a Scottish soldier in his kilt. He looks across the landscape over the Y Ravine and beyond the German Front Line where this successful action broke through.

The sculptor was George Harry Paulin, A.R.S.A., F.R.B.S. (1888–1962) and the titlle of the sculpture was "Bronze Statuette – Memorial to 51st Highland Division at Beaumont Hamel 1924". The model for the sculpture was a Company Sergeant Major in the Division.

The German regiment in the line at Beaumont Hamel was the 119 Reserve Infantry Regiment. The regiment had arrived in this sector in late September 1914, at which time it been engaged in a fight with the French Army. In August 1915 the French Army left this sector and the British Army took over. 119 Reserve Infantry Regiment, however, held this part of the German Front Line for 19 months as part of the 26th Reserve Division before the Battle of the Somme began on 1 July 1916.

The German Front Line in the part of the sector at Y Ravine was situated at the bottom of a gentle slope. The British Front Line was situated a few hundred metres away on the higher ground of the slope. In spite of the pounding of the German Line by the 7 day British artillery bombardment before the attack on 1 July, most of the German soldiers had survived the shelling by sheltering in their protective bunkers. German accounts state that their nerves were frayed by the end of the 7 days, but their casualties were relatively light. When the British artillery fire was lifted a few minutes before Zero Hour of 07.30, the German soldiers at the bottom of the hill near Y Ravine were able to get back quickly into their battered trenches and man their machine guns. The British battalions making their way down the slope towards them were plain to see and were fired on by the German defenders as they approached them.

The men of the Newfoundland Regiment moved forward at about 09.00 hours to follow on behind the leading battalion in the advance of 88th Brigade. Many of them were shot down trying to clamber over ground to cover the few yards from where they were in the rear of the British Front Line to start their advance down the hill.

The Danger Tree is a petrified tree and the only original tree in this location to survive the 1914–1918 fighting in this location.

|-
|File WO 32/5891 held at The National Archives in Kew covers the Royal Naval Division Memorial at Beaucourt.   Correspondence in the file runs from 1921 to 1923.   We learn that Alan G Brace designed the memorial and the land on which it stood was purchased for 200 francs from a Madame Maison.  The memorial is in the form of a tall obelisk. There are bronze plaques on the front, the main one explaining that the memorial honours those men of the Royal Naval Division who fell at the Battle of the Ancre during the final phase of the Somme battles, on 13 and 14 November 1916.  When the Royal Naval Division Memorial Committee was seeking to put a monument in place in 1921, Lord Rothermere offered to provide funding, as his son, Lieutenant the Honourable Vere Harmsworth had been killed in the Battle of the Ancre.       He is buried in Ancre British Cemetery.  With the help of this funding, the memorial was unveiled on 12 November 1922. The position it stands on was No Man's Land during the battle, and at the time of the unveiling the land still bore the scars. The unveiling ceremony was performed by General Sir Hubert Gough along with Brigadier-General Arthur Asquith, and around 200 officers and men of the Royal Naval Division who had fought there were also present.

|-
|At Longueval there is a memorial to all the pipers who fell in the 1914–18 War.  It was inaugurated on 20 July 2002 and was sculptured by [[Andy DeComyn]]. It shows a piper in full battle dress, kilt and tin helmet climbing up and over the parapet of a trench and encouraging the men on with the sound of his pipes.
[[File:Piper's Memorial 2.jpg|thumb|centre|200px|The Piper's Memorial at Longueval]]
It is said that the sound of the Bagpipes frightened the Germans to death in both World Wars and in the 1914–1918 war the Germans called the kilted Highlanders the "Ladies from Hell".    Two pipers deserve mention, Pipers Laidlaw and Mackenzie.

On 25 September 1915, the first day of the Battle of Loos, Piper Laidlaw was awarded the Victoria Cross.   At a point where the men of the 7th Kings Own Scottish Borderers were in some confusion, crouched in their trenches when the gas clouds rolled back to engulf them, it was the sound of the pipes played by Piper Laidlaw, heard above the noise of the German guns, and falling shrapnel, which first steadied and then galvanised the line. Piper Laidlaw had jumped onto the parapet, torn of his mask, and begun to play his pipes!   It was as though the Scots had had a massive injection of adrenalin, and soon they poured over the top and massed towards the German Lines, as Laidlaw marched up and down playing "The Standard on the Braes O'Mar" and the regimental march, the "Blue Bonnets". It was said that Laidlaw had every drone shot off his pipes, and the bag punctured in several places. We can read the exact citation in WO 98 at The National Archives. Loos is of course covered in the Artois section of this article so this is a slight digression.

During the same battle the 6th Battalion Kings Own Scottish Borderers were similarly inspired by the pipes of Pipe-Major Robert Mackenzie. Mackenzie was 60 years of age, and although wounded had continued to play his pipes. He died on 8 October 1915. We can see both Laidlaw and Mackenzie's medal index cards in WO 373 at The National Archives.

|A tribute to [[McCrae's Battalion]], the 16th [[Royal Scots]], is to be found at [[Contalmaison]] where they fought on the opening day of the [[Battle of the Somme]].   The cairn remembers in particular players and supporters of [[Heart of Midlothian Football Club]] who made a significant contribution to the make–up of the battalion.   The Contalmaison Cairn (designed by historian, Jack Alexander) was completed in 2004 and dedicated before a crowd of over 800 battalion families; Hearts, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibs]], [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] and [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] supporters; Royal Scots and government representatives.
[[File:Hearts of Midlothian 2.jpg|thumb|centre|300px||McCrae's Battalion Memorial]]
The 16th (Service) Battalion (2nd Edinburgh) was known as [[George McCrae (politician)|Sir George McCrae]]'s Battalion or (more familiarly) "McCrae's Own". Thirteen players from Heart of Midlothian joined up in November 1914 when Hearts were top of the Scottish League.   Professional footballers from Raith Rovers, [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] and Falkirk, and amateur players from [[Dalkeith Thistle F.C.|Dalkeith Thistle]], [[Linlithgow Rose F.C.|Linlithgow Rose]], [[Newtongrange Star F.C.|Newtongrange Star]], Pumpherston Rangers and West End Athletic joined McCrae's Own as did other sportsmen, along with  many Hearts and Hibernian supporters.

The '''Mandate of Heaven''' or '''Tian Ming''' ({{zh|t=天命|p=Tiānmìng|w=T'ien-ming}}) is a Chinese political and religious [[doctrine]] used since [[ancient China|ancient times]] to justify the rule of the [[King of China|King]] or [[Emperor of China]]. According to this belief, heaven  (天, ''[[Tian]]'')—which embodies the natural order and will of the universe—bestows the mandate on a [[justice|just ruler]] of China, the "[[Son of Heaven]]" of the "[[Celestial Empire]]". If a ruler was overthrown, this was interpreted as an indication that the ruler was unworthy, and had lost the mandate. It was also a common belief among citizens that natural disasters such as famine and flood were signs of heaven's displeasure with the ruler, so there would often be revolts following major disasters as citizens saw these as signs that the Mandate of Heaven had been withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Szczepanski|first1=Kallie|title=What Is the Mandate of Heaven in China?|url=http://asianhistory.about.com/od/ancientchina/f/What-Is-The-Mandate-Of-Heaven.htm|website=About Education|access-date=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dynastic Cycle .gif|thumb|A brief flow chart describing the dynastic cycles in Imperial China on claiming to withdrawing the Mandate of Heaven]]
The Mandate of Heaven does not require a legitimate ruler to be of noble birth, depending instead on the just and able performance of the rulers and their heirs. Dynasties such as the [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming dynasties]] were founded by men of common origins. The concept is in some ways similar to the European concept of the [[divine right of kings]]; however, unlike the European concept, it does not in theory confer an unconditional right to rule, despite this being exactly the case in practicality. The Mandate would in theory be a preoccupation in a ruler's lifetime, when he would hold onto the Mandate and live according to Heavens. Intrinsic to the concept of the Mandate of Heaven was the [[right of rebellion]] against an unjust ruler. Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that Heaven had withdrawn its mandate from the ruler. Throughout [[Chinese history]], times of [[poverty]] and [[natural disasters]] were often taken as signs that heaven considered the incumbent ruler unjust and thus in need of replacement. The Mandate of Heaven was often invoked by philosophers and scholars in China as a way to curtail the abuse of power by the ruler. While each dynasty was not the same, they each had a lineage that passed on the prospective ruler by order of generational descent or their priority of birth. Many emperors during the imperial times would optimize to have many sons who could be candidates to fill the position after the current ruler has died. In addition Heaven was thought to be of how a ruler's works and performance was, which reflected upon how favorable they would be to Heaven.

[[Mencius]], a great philosopher who many thought was the successor to [[Confucius]], said:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56648867|title=Mencius|last=Mencius.|date=2004|publisher=Penguin|others=Lau, D. C. (Dim Cheuk)|isbn=9780140449716|edition= Rev.|location=London|oclc=56648867}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=The people are of supreme importance; the altars of the gods of earth and grain come next; last comes the ruler. That is why he who gains the confidence of the multitudinous people will be Emperor... When a feudal lord endangers the altars of the gods of earth and grain, he should be replaced. When the sacrificial animals are sleek, the offerings are clean and the sacrifices are observed at due times, and yet floods and droughts come [by the agency of heaven], then the altars should be replaced.|sign=Mencius|source=}}

The concept of the Mandate of Heaven was first used to support the rule of the [[king]]s of the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE), and legitimize their overthrow of the earlier [[Shang dynasty]] (1600–1069 BCE). It was used throughout the history of China to legitimize the successful overthrow and installation of new emperors, including non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] ethnic monarchs such as the [[Qing dynasty]] (1636–1912). This concept was also used by monarchs in neighboring countries like Korea and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=Brian|title=Why the North Vietnamese will keep fighting|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2008/P4395-1.pdf|website=RAND|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The right to rule and the right of rebellion ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that the Mandate of Heaven had passed. In China, the right of rebellion against an unjust ruler has been a part of political philosophy ever since the Zhou dynasty, and the successful rebellion was interpreted by Chinese historians as evidence that divine approval had passed on to the successive dynasty. The Right of Rebellion is not coded into any official law. Rather, rebellion is always outlawed and severely punished; but is still a positive right grounded in the Chinese moral system. Often, it is used as a justification for actions to overthrow a previous dynasty after a rebellion has been successful and a new dynastic rule has been established. Since the winner is the one who determines who has obtained the Mandate of Heaven and who has lost it, some Chinese scholars consider it to be a sort of [[Victor's justice]], best characterized in the popular Chinese saying "The winner becomes king, the loser becomes outlaw" (Chinese: “[[Wikt:成者為王，敗者為寇|成者爲王，敗者爲寇]]”). 

Due to the above, it is considered that Chinese historical accounts of the fall of a dynasty and the rise of a new one must be handled with caution. Chinese traditional historical compilation methods produce accounts that tend to fit their account to the theory; emphasizing aspects tending to prove that the old dynasty lost the Mandate of Heaven and the new one gained it, and de-emphasize other aspects.

== Transition between the Shang and the Zhou ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
The prosperous Shang dynasty saw its rule filled with many outstanding accomplishments. Notably, the dynasty lasted for a considerable time during which 31 kings ruled over an extended period of 17 generations. During this period, the dynasty enjoyed a period of peace and tranquility in which citizens could make a good living. The government was originally able to control most of its internal affairs due to the firm support provided by the people. As time went on, however, the rulers' abuse of the other social classes led to social unrest and instability. The corruption in this dynasty created the conditions necessary for a new ruling house to rise {{mdash}}the Zhou dynasty. Rebellion against the Shang was led by [[King Wu of Zhou|Zhou Wu]]. They created the Mandate of Heaven to explain their right to assume rule and presumed that the only way to hold the mandate was to rule well in the eyes of Heaven. They believed that the Shang ruling house had become morally corrupt, and that the Shang leaders' loss of virtue entitled their own house to take over. The overthrow of the Shang Dynasty, they said, was in accordance with the mandate given by Heaven.&lt;ref name="Tignor, Robert L. 2014"&gt;Tignor, Robert L., et al. Worlds together, worlds apart. 4th ed., vol. 1, W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] became the ruling dynasty, they mostly appointed their own officials. The Zhou Dynasty had their own way of assigning their officials. However, in order to appease some of the citizens, they allowed some [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] beneficiaries to continue governing their small kingdoms in compliance with Zhou rules and regulations.  As the empire continued to expand, intermarriage increased because the rulers believed that it was a method of forming strong alliances that enabled them to absorb more countries into the dynasty. In case of a war, the Zhou dynasty boasted an excellent military and technology mostly because of influence from annexed countries. They also excelled in shipbuilding, which, coupled with their discovery of [[celestial navigation]], made them excellent mariners. Intellectually, the Zhou excelled in fields of literature and philosophy while many governmental positions were filled according to the intellectual ability of a candidate. A large amount of literature survives from the Zhou period, including the ''[[I Ching|Book of Changes]]'', ''[[Classic of History|Book of History]]'', ''Book of Etiquette'', ''[[Book of Song]]'', ''[[Classic of Poetry|Book of Odes]]'', and the ''[[Book of Rites]]''. Most of these works are commentaries on the progress and political movement of the dynasty. In philosophical terms, [[Confucius]] and his followers played an important role in shaping the mentality of the government as defined by the [[Five Confucian Relationships]]. These critical thinkers served as a foundation for the government. Their works primarily stressed the importance of the ruling class, respect and their relationship with the lower class. Due to the growing size of the dynasty, it became apparent that a centralized government would lead to a lot of confusion and corruption because the government would not be able to exert its influence or accede to the needs of everyone. To address this political barrier, the dynasty formed a decentralized government in which the empire was broken down into sections. Within these districts were administrators who were appointed by the government, in return, they had to maintain their allegiance to the main internal government. In effect, the Zhou dynasty became a collection of districts. Consequently, this marked the fall of the dynasty as it became difficult for the central government to exert influence on all other regions of the empire.

Finally, when the Zhou dynasty's power decreased, it was wiped out by the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]], which believed that the Zhou had become weak and their rule unjust.&lt;ref name="Tignor, Robert L. 2014"/&gt; This transition emphasizes the customary trend of the Mandate of Heaven, which provided leeway for the rise of a new power. The Qin initially attempted to capitalize on the errors made by the Zhou, either by eliminating the source of error or reforming it. During this reformation, administrative changes were made and a system of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] was developed which stated that the law is supreme over every individual, including the rulers. Although significant progress was made during the Qin dynasty, the persecution of scholars and ordinary citizens led to an unstable state.

After the death of [[Qin Shihuang]], first emperor of the [[Qin dynasty]], a widespread revolt by prisoners, peasants, and unhappy soldiers inevitably led to the fall of the Qin dynasty due to its tyrannical practices.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The establishment of the [[Han dynasty]] marked a great period in China’s history marked by significant changes in the political structure of the country. Under the Han emperors, significant changes were made in which the government introduced entrance examinations known as civil service or [[imperial examination]]s for governmental positions. Additionally, the Han dynasty prospered economically through the [[Silk Road]] and other trading means.

== Five Dynasties period ==
{{Main|Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period}}

During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period, there was no dominant Chinese dynasty that ruled all of China. This created a problem for the [[Song dynasty]] that followed, as they wanted to legitimize their rule by claiming that the Mandate of Heaven had passed on them. The scholar-official [[Xue Juzheng]] compiled the ''[[Old History of the Five Dynasties]]'' (五代史) during the 960s and 970s, after the Song dynasty had taken northern [[China]] from the last of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties]], the [[Later Zhou]].  A major purpose was to establish justification for the transference of the Mandate of Heaven through these five dynasties, and thus to the Song dynasty. He argued that these dynasties met certain vital criteria to be considered as having attained the Mandate of Heaven despite never having ruled all of China.  One is that they all ruled the traditional Chinese heartland.  They also held considerably more territory than any of the other Chinese states that had existed conterminously in the south.

However, there were certain other areas where these dynasties all clearly fell short.  The brutal behavior of [[Zhu Wen]] and the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]] was a source of considerable embarrassment, and thus there was pressure to exclude them from the Mandate.  The following three dynasties, the [[Later Tang]], [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]], and [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Later Han]] were all non-Han Chinese dynasties, all having been ruled by the [[Shatuo]] ethnic minority.  There is also the concern that though each of them was the most powerful Chinese kingdom of its respective era, none of them ever really had the ability to unify the entire Chinese realm as there were several powerful states to the south.  However, it was the conclusion of [[Xue Juzheng]] that the Mandate had indeed passed through each of the Five Dynasties, and thus onto the Song Dynasty when it conquered the last of those dynasties.

== Transition between the Ming and the Qing ==
In previous dynasties the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties reigned for much of the beginning three centuries where the mandate of heaven was questioned heavily between dynastic councils among each emperor. Some emperors were not entirely sure of their validity when it came to claiming the mandate, for it was ambiguous. Especially for the case of the [[Jurchen Jin]], where much of the council was not sure how to discern the validity of their rulers. From the [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty]] to [[Kangxi Emperor]] much of the chosen emperors contemplated much of this when they became a contender for the mandate. The reason for this was because of the ambiguity of the Mandate and overwhelmingly unofficial formality when declaring the Mandate of Heaven. However, [[Kublai Khan|Kubilai Khan]] was the only indifferent ruler when he claimed the Mandate of Heaven over the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]] since he had a sizable military and was part of the [[Khitan people]], as with many others from the same background since they did not have the same traditions and culture as their Chinese adversaries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imperial China|last=Porter|first=Jonathan|publisher=Rowland &amp; Littlefield, Inc|date=February 12, 2016|isbn=9781442222922|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was said that the peasant group of the Ming dynasty were the real selectors which allowed for the Mandate of Heaven to be claimed by the ruler. As a prospective candidate to the Mandate, they could please the peasantry group in order to win favor amongst the dynasty. It was solely politics from beginning to end and an attempt from the emperor to maintain a favorable act towards Heaven. Many emperors within the Qing dynasty looked immensely within themselves trying to come to terms with their ruling if natural disasters occurred within their time. This was interpreted as a warning of Heaven's displeased wrath towards an emperors ruling, such that the Mandate under their rule was unstable. Furthermore, Qing emperors would take their advisors feedback very seriously when pertaining to ruling and take it upon themselves to reflect on their current decisions of the dynastic overview in hopes that it favors Heaven.

== Neighboring countries==
The concept of the Mandate of Heaven eventually spread to nearby countries as a justification for rule by divine political legitimacy. In Korea, it was first adopted by the [[Joseon]] dynasty and became an enduring state ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diplomat|first1=Gi-Wook Shin and Rennie J. Moon, The|title=South Korea's President Lost the 'Mandate of Heaven'|url=https://thediplomat.com/2016/11/south-koreas-president-lost-the-mandate-of-heaven/|website=The Diplomat|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japan]]ese government found the concept ideologically problematic, preferring not to have divine political legitimacy that was conditional and that could be withdrawn. The Japanese [[Taihō Code]], formulated in 703, was largely an adaptation of the governmental system of [[China]]'s then [[Tang dynasty]], but the Mandate of Heaven was specifically omitted. In later times, this need was obviated because the [[Imperial House of Japan]] claimed to be descended in an unbroken line from the Japanese [[Solar deity|sun goddess]], [[Amaterasu]]. Nevertheless, while maintaining this role, the Japanese emperor became politically marginalized in the Nara and [[Heian period]]s by powerful regents of the [[Fujiwara clan]] who seized executive control of state.  Even though the Japanese imperial line itself remained unbroken after the eighth century, actual political authority passed through successive dynasties of regents and ''[[shōgun]]s'' which cycled in a manner similar to that of Chinese dynasties.  Even after the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, when the emperor was placed back in the center of the political bureaucracy, the throne itself had very little power vis-à-vis the [[Meiji oligarchy]]. Actual political power has passed through at least four systems since the Meiji restoration: the [[Taishō period|Taishō democracy]], the [[Japanese militarism|militarists]], the [[Occupation of Japan]], and [[Post-Occupation Japan|postwar democracy]].  The emperor today is a political figurehead and not a ruling sovereign. It could be said the imperial line of Japan survived for so long precisely because it did not have control over the state, and that the turmoil of succession was projected onto a series of proxy rulers.

Josiah is generally seen as the man on the right with Jechoniah being the child on his knee.  The boy being held by the woman is one of Jechoniah's brothers.]]
'''Matthew 1:11''' is the eleventh verse of the first chapter of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[New Testament]].  The verse is part of the section where the [[genealogy]] of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], the father of [[Jesus]], is listed.  It is the last verse of the middle third of the listing.

In the [[King James Version]] of the Bible the text reads:
:And [[Josiah|Josias]] begat [[Jeconiah|Jechonias]] and 
:his brethren, about the time 
:they were carried away to [[Babylon]]:

The [[World English Bible]] translates the passage as:
:Josiah became the father of 
:Jechoniah and his brothers, at 
:the time of the exile to Babylon.

==Analysis==
This portion is part of the listing of the [[Kingdom of Judah|Kings of Judah]] and covers the period from the mid-7th century BC to the beginning of the [[Babylonian captivity]].  [[Josiah]] was a prominent monarch who reigned from 641 BC or 640 BC until 609 BC.  [[Jeconiah]] came two monarchs later and is best known for being defeated and brought with his people in captivity in Babylon around 598 BC. {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The main question about this passage is what it means by the word ''brothers''.  According to the [[Books of Chronicles]], [[Jeconiah]] only had one brother, so the plural does not make sense.  A common view is to see Jeconiah's name in this section as an error.  Jeconiah, who is already listed in [[Matthew 1:12]], sometimes has his name written as ''Jehoiachin'' making it possible that the author of Matthew or a later scribe confused him with his father [[Jehoiakim]].  In [[Irenaeus]]' Latin version of this text Jehoiakim's name appears, but this is the only piece of textual evidence for this theory. All other ancient versions leave him out.  Also in Iraneus, the brothers are still associated with Jeconiah. This theory would also address a number of other problems.  Josiah is believed to be Jeconiah's grandfather rather than father, and having the listing of Jeconiah as two separate people would correct the seeming error in [[Matthew 1:17]].  Jehoiakim had a number of brothers and these are mentioned in [[1 Chronicles 3:15]]. [[William F. Albright]] and C.S. Mann believe the author of Matthew mentioned the brothers, despite their having nothing to do with Jesus' genealogy, because they are prominently mentioned in Chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;[[William F. Albright|Albright, W.F.]] and C.S. Mann. "Matthew." ''[[The Anchor Bible Series]].'' New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert H. Gundry]] disagrees with this view.  The [[Septuagint]], from which Matthew seems to have got his spelling, uses the spellings Jeconiah, making it less likely that the name would be confused with Jehoiakim.  Moreover the repeating of Jeconiah's name in the next verse matches the repeating of names that occurs throughout the genealogy. Gundry believes that ''brothers'' refers to the Jewish people in general who were brought to Babylon with their king, not the biological brothers of Jeconiah.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert H. Gundry|Gundry, Robert H.]] ''Matthew a Commentary on his Literary and Theological Art.'' Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Harold Fowler suggests that brothers might have simply meant ''family'', and the word was included since Jeconiah's family did have an important role in the Old Testament reports.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Harold. ''The Gospel of Matthew: Volume One.'' Joplin: College Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Fowler believes that the omission was explicitly intended. He argues that the "at the time of the exile to Babylon" makes it clear that this is not simply a genealogy, but also a quick summary of Jewish history. As such leaving out names would simply be part of the attempt to compress thousands of years of history into seventeen verses. The story of the Babylonian captivity is a long and complicated one, with many figures involved. Fowler argues that the word ''brothers'' was included to allow Matthew to simply skip over this tangled period without being diverted from his task by mentioning the actual names.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Harold. ''The Gospel of Matthew: Volume One.'' Joplin: College Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manuscripts have additional reading in this verse — {{lang|grc|τον Ιωακιμ, Ιωακιμ δε εγεννησεν}} (''Joakim, Joakim begot'') — [[Codex Campianus|M]] [[Codex Nanianus|U]] [[Codex Koridethi|Θ]] [[Rossano Gospels|Σ]] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 33 258 478 661 954 1216 1230 1354 1604 [[Lectionary 54]] syr&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt; geo.&lt;ref&gt;UBS3, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Meir Max Bineth.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Meir Max Bineth]]

'''Meir Max Bineth''' ('''Max Bennett''') (27 June 1917 &amp;ndash; 21 December 1954) was a lieutenant colonel in the Israeli Intelligence.&lt;ref name="memory site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meirmaxbineth.org/?page_id=80 |title=Meir Max Bineth |publisher=meirmaxbineth.org | accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Bineth was born in [[Hungary]], the grandson of the scholar [[Jacob Obermeyer]]. He grew up in [[Cologne|Köln, Germany]], from 1919 until 1935, when he and his parents left Nazi Germany and emigrated to Palestine.

Meir's last duty and mission was as an Israeli intelligence spy (Secret Fighter) in [[Egypt]], from 1952 to the end of 1954. He was sent there undercover as a German businessman, representing various German firms – primarily "von Laufenberg", a firm manufacturing equipment for the disabled and crippled. He was the first Israeli intelligence agent sent to an enemy country under a German identity, and was likely partly selected due to his early years in Germany.

Meir's mission in Egypt was to gather information for Israeli Intelligence about the strength of the Egyptian army, the power of the military industry, Egyptian strategy and intentions toward Israel, the activities of significant anti-Israeli bodies, propaganda etc.

Many doors of Egypt's top military echelon opened before him; he became acquainted with General [[Muhammad Naguib]], then President of Egypt. He also built relations with German military and intelligence personnel and ranking ex-Nazi "advisors" who had found refuge in Egypt after the [[Second World War]]. Some of them were scientists who were helping Egypt develop missiles that could potentially threaten Israel.

While working in Egypt, Meir was nominated as a consultant engineer at the "Anglo Egyptian Motors Company" (the German branch of the [[Ford Motor Company]] in Egypt), and suggested several projects to help improve Egypt's economy, believing that a crucial reason that generates wars between nations and communities is the lack of economic and social equilibrium; among other things he wrote in his prison cell for his defense was the line "I think that the principal cause of wars is the age-old fear existing between man and communities that there may not be enough bread for all."

Meir's cover and conduct were perfect—he had German citizenship, grew up with German culture, literature and music, and German was his mother tongue. During the last seven months of his secret mission in Egypt, his wife Jane (South African in origin) and daughter joined him.

Bineth was caught and arrested after the failure of [[false flag]] Operation Susannah, an incident later known as the [[Lavon Affair]]. Meir had been ordered by a senior officer in Israel to deliver money for the groups' needs and had met Marcelle Ninio a few times. Ninio was the last to be caught; under torture she gave a description of Meir's car, which led to his capture.

After five months of interrogation and torture, on the day before his trial, Meir committed suicide in his prison cell (his wife and child were in Europe). He realized that there was no way out for him and did not want to give the Egyptians the pleasure of hanging him in public, which was the fate awaiting him after conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jafi.org/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/Gallery+of+People+(Biographies)/Meir+Max+Bineth.htm |title=Meir Max Bineth 1917-1954 |publisher=Jewish Agency for Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His body was re-interred in the [[Mount Herzl]] military cemetery in Jerusalem, in 1959.&lt;ref name="memory site"/&gt;

'''Muslims''' ([[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], and [[Slovene language|Slovene]]:  ''Muslimani'', Муслимани) was a term used in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] as an official designation of [[ethnicity]] for [[Slavic Muslims]], thus clumping together a number of in actuality completely distinct ethnicities, among them most numerous being the [[Bosniaks]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Sandžak]], along with smaller groups of different ethnicity, such as [[Gorani people|Gorani]] in [[Kosovo]] and [[Macedonian Muslims]] (''Torbeši''), but also in numerous cases even non-Slavic, such as Muslim Turks, Muslim Albanians and Muslim Bulgarians, whenever people perceived and expressed their religious identity superior to their ethnic background. Notably, "Muslims" were one of the constitutive nations of the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. 
 	
Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Sandžak mostly adopted the "Bosniak" ethnic designation in connection to their national awakening on the eve of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] in the early 1990s and they are today constitutionally recognized as such in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 100,000 people across the former Yugoslavia still consider themselves to be Muslims in an ethnic sense.

==Background==
===Bosnian Muslims===
Up until the 19th century, the word Bosniak (''Bošnjak'') came to refer to all inhabitants of Bosnia regardless of religious affiliation; terms such as "Boşnak milleti", "Boşnak kavmi", and "Boşnak taifesi" (all meaning, roughly, "the Bosnian people"), were used in the Ottoman Empire to describe Bosnians in an ethnic or "tribal" sense. After the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878]], the Austrian administration officially endorsed ''Bošnjaštvo'' ('Bosniakhood') as the basis of a multi-confessional Bosnian nation. The policy aspired to isolate Bosnia and Herzegovina from its irredentist neighbors (Orthodox Serbia, Catholic Croatia, and the Muslims of the Ottoman Empire) and to negate the concept of Croatian and Serbian nationhood which had already begun to take ground among Bosnia and Herzegovina's Catholic and Orthodox communities, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf8P-7ExoKYC&amp;pg=PA130|title=Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina, pp. 130-135 |last=Velikonja |first=Mitja |year=2003 |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |isbn=1-58544-226-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qJvbRP5KSq4C&amp;pg=PA73|title=Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed |author=Robert Donia, John VA Fine|year=2005 |work= |publisher= Columbia University Press |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in part due to the dominant standing held in the previous centuries by the native Muslim population in Ottoman Bosnia, a sense of Bosnian nationhood was cherished mainly by Muslim Bosnians, while fiercely opposed by nationalists from Serbia and Croatia who were instead opting to claim the Bosnian Muslim population as their own, a move that was rejected by most of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5J_gAU8c9NIC&amp;pg=PA110|title=Central and South-Eastern Europe 2004, Volume 4, Routledge, p 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later "Kingdom of Yugoslavia") was formed and it recognized only those three nationalities in its constitution.

==History==
After World War II, in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], the Bosnian Muslims continued to be treated as a religious group instead of an ethnic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Banac |first=Ivo |title=The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-8014-9493-1 |pages=287–288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, in a debate that went on during the 1960s, many Bosniak [[communist]] intellectuals argued that the Muslims of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] are in fact a distinct native Slavic people that should be recognized as a [[nation]]. In 1964, the Fourth Congress of the Bosnian branch of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] assured their Bosniaks membership the Bosniaks' right to [[self-determination]] will be fulfilled, thus prompting the recognition of Bosnian Muslims as a distinct nation at a meeting of the Bosnian Central Committee in 1968, however not under the Bosniak or Bosnian name, as opted by the Bosnian Muslim communist leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Banac, Ivo (1988). The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics. Cornell University Press. pp. 287–288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-qjT00IDIQC&amp;pg=PA65|title=Kostic, Roland 2007. Ambivalent Peace: External Peacebuilding, Threatened Identity and Reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Report No. 78, Department of Peace and Conflict Research and the Programme for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Uppsala University, Sweden, p.65}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a compromise, the Constitution of Yugoslavia was amended to list "Muslims" in a national sense; recognizing a constitutive nation, but not the Bosniak name. The use of ''Muslim'' as an ethnic denomination was criticized early on, especially on account of motives and reasoning, as well as disregard of this aspect of Bosnian nationhood.&lt;ref name="Imamovic"&gt;Imamović, Mustafa (1996). Historija Bošnjaka. Sarajevo: BZK Preporod. {{ISBN|9958-815-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes other terms, such as ''Muslim with capital M'' were used, that is, "musliman" was a practicing Muslim while "Musliman" was a member of this nation ([[Serbo-Croatian]] uses capital letters for names of peoples but small for names of adherents).

After the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, the majority of these people, around two million, mostly located in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the region of [[Sandzak|Sandžak]], declare as ethnic [[Bosniaks]] (''Bošnjaci'', sing. ''Bošnjak''). On the other hand, some still use the old name ''Muslimani'' (Muslims), mostly outside Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The election law of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, recognizes the results from 1991 population census as results referring to Bosniaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election law of Bosnia and Herzegovina| url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4d2d91252.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= CONSTITUTION OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA |url=http://www.ccbh.ba/public/down/USTAV_BOSNE_I_HERCEGOVINE_engl.pdf|publisher=The [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23874">The '''New Qing History''' is a [[school of thought]] that gained prominence in the United States in the mid-1990s by offering a wide-ranging [[Historical revisionism|revision of history]] of the Manchu [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Grace Yen Shen, ''Unearthing the Nation: Modern Geology and Nationalism in Republican China'', (University of California Press, 2014), 200 note4.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier historians had emphasized the power of [[Han Chinese]] to “[[sinicization|sinicize]]” their conquerors, that is, to assimilate and make them Chinese in their thought and institutions. In the 1980s and early 1990s, American scholars began to learn Manchu and took advantage of newly opened [[Chinese language|Chinese]]- and [[Manchu language|Manchu]]-language archives. This research found that the Manchu rulers were savvy in manipulating their subjects and from the 1630s through at least the 18th century, emperors developed a sense of Manchu identity and used [[Central Asia]]n models of rule as much as they did [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ones. According to some scholars, at the height of their power, the Qing regarded "China" as only a part, although a very important part, of [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|a much wider empire that extended into]] the [[Inner Asia]]n territories of [[Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], the [[Northeast China|Northeast]] (today sometimes called [[Manchuria]]) and [[Xinjiang]], or Chinese (Eastern) Turkestan.{{sfnb|Waley-Cohen|2004| p = 194-197}}

Some scholars criticize the approach for exaggerating the Manchu character of the dynasty, and some in China accuse the American historians in the group of imposing American concerns with race and identity or even of imperialist misunderstanding to weaken China. Still others in China agree that this scholarship has opened new vistas for the study of Qing history.{{sfnb|Ding|2009| p = [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/CSH0009-4633430208#.VO0CxfnF-7s ]}}

The use of "New Qing History" as an approach is to be distinguished from the ''New Qing History'', a multi-volume history of the Qing dynasty that was authorized by the [[Chinese State Council]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 =Mao |first1 = Liping |last2 = Zhao |first2 =Ma  |title ="Writing History in the Digital Age": The New Qing History Project and the Digitization of Qing Archives |journal =History Compass |volume =10 |issue = 5 |pages =367–374 |date =2012 |language = |jstor = |issn = |doi = 10.1111/j.1478-0542.2012.00841.x |ref= none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Prominent scholars who have been associated with the New Qing History, including [[Evelyn Rawski]], [[Mark Elliott (historian)|Mark Elliott]], [[Pamela Kyle Crossley]], [[Laura Hostetler]], Philippe Forêt, and others, despite differing among themselves on important points, represent an "[[Inner Asia]]n" and "[[Eurasia]]n" turn, which conceived the Manchu-centered Qing as fundamentally different from most earlier dynasties but as similar to the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]], [[Mogul empire|Mogul]], and [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] Empires across the Eurasian landmass. They argued that the Qing saw itself as a universal empire, a multi-national polity, which with China as only the most central and economically important component. They date the founding of the empire from 1636, when the dynasty was proclaimed, rather than from 1644, when the Qing took control of Beijing. The historians argued that "Manchu" identity was deliberately created only after the takeover of China and that the new racial identity was important but "fungible," easily exchanged for others. The first rulers of the dynasty played the Confucian role of [[Son of Heaven]] but at the same time, often behind the backs of their Han Chinese ministers, adopted other roles to rule other ethnic groups.

The military expansion of frontiers, which Han Chinese ministers often opposed, as it drained resources from China proper, showed that the Qing empire was not only a victim of imperialism but also practiced imperialism itself. Some of the historians followed Evelyn Rawski calling the Qing "Early Modern," rather than "late imperial," on the grounds that the Manchus created a centralized empire that the Ming could not have created.{{sfnb|Rowe|2009| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=KN7Awmzx2PAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20qing%20history%22&amp;f=false 4-10]}}

==Origins==
The origins of the New Qing History lie in Inner Asian Studies. A Harvard scholar, Joseph Fletcher, studied the languages and culture of Central Asia. He was among those to discredit the idea that nearly all Manchu documents were translations from Chinese and that they would add little to the record. He wrote in 1981, "Qing scholars who want to do first-class work in the archives must, from now on, learn Manchu and routinely compare the Manchu and Chinese sources for their topics of research." Beatrice Bartlett, a Yale historian who had studied Manchu with Fletcher, reported in an article, 'Books of Revelations', that the archives in Taiwan and Beijing revealed many secrets, which required knowledge of Manchu.

The [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]] of the Yongzheng emperor operated only in Manchu until the 1730s, and many other important edicts and memorials did not have Chinese translations. Official use of the language, she argued, did not decline during the 19th century. She concluded that the archives of Manchu materials were more likely to be complete, as they were less likely to have been raided, weeded or lost.&lt;ref&gt;Both quoted in {{cite book | first = Gertrude | last = Roth Li | title = Manchu: A Textbook for Reading Documents | year = 2010 | publisher = National Foreign Language Resource Center | p =11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1bArr1-E5mQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Fletcher%20manchu%20language&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 29, 2017| isbn = 9780980045956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Qing History took on distinct form in the mid-1990s. In 1993, Crossley and Rawski summarized the arguments for using Manchu-language materials, materials, which they and others had explored in the newly opened archives in Beijing and were beginning to use in their publications.{{sfnb|CrossleyRawski|1993}} Evelyn Rawski's presidential address, "Re-envisioning the Qing: The Significance of the Qing Period in Chinese History," at the annual meeting of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] in 1996, particularly criticized the question of the "sinicization" of the Qing that had been raised by [[Ping-ti Ho]] in his 1967 article "The Significance of the Ch'ing Period in Chinese History." Rawski's thought was based on a Manchu-centric concept of history and indicated that the reason the Qing rulers could successfully govern China for nearly 300 years was not the result of sinicization, adopting the characteristics of Han Chinese rule and culture, but by their focus on retaining the characteristics of Manchu culture. They used such characteristics to strengthen relations with other nationalities to build a multiracial empire that included [[Manchu people|Manchu]], [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Mongols|Mongol]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] and other nationalities.{{sfnb|Rawski|1996|}} For better governing his multiethnic empire, for instance, the Kangxi emperor located his summer residence in the [[Chengde Mountain Resort]], north of the Great Wall. That became the historical core of city of [[Chengde]], which the Qianlong emperor enlarged considerably, including a replica of the [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;Forêt (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Ping-ti Ho published "In Defense of Sinicization: A Rebuttal of Evelyn Rawski's 'Re-envisioning the Qing'". He argued that the pattern of Chinese history was for a [[conquest dynasty]] to adopt Chinese ways of rule and culture and attacked Rawski for Manchu-centrism.{{sfnb|Ho|1998|}}

The school that is now known as the "New Qing History" developed after the debate.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Kyle Crossley, [http://www.csstoday.com/Item/1243.aspx Beyond the culture: my comments on New Qing history]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, historian Huang Pei published a monograph that developed the objections stated by Ho Ping-ti. {{sfnb|Huang|2011|}}

There are differences among the scholars in the loose group. For example, Rawski's ''Re-envisioning the Qing'' and Elliott’s ''The Manchu Way'' regard the Qing as a Manchu empire, with China being only one part. Nevertheless, Pamela Kyle Crossley sees the empire not as a Manchu empire but as a "simultaneous" system in which the rulership is not subordinate to the Chinese or any other single culture. She criticized the "Manchu-centered" school for romanticism and a reliance upon disproved theories about "[[Altaic]]" language and history, but she seems to include herself in the Qing empire school, which she calls "Qing Studies."&lt;ref&gt;"A Reserved View of the New Qing History"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, historian Richard J. Smith reported that an interpretive "middle ground" had emerged between the views of Rawski and Crossley, on one hand, and Ho and Huang, on the other. Smith himself had come to the conclusion that "the Qing empire" and "China" were not the same thing and that the Qing had to be placed in not only a Manchu context but one that included Inner Asia in general and that saw China in a global field. The less "sinocentric" view, Smith continued, which placed less emphasis on "sinicization," had won over most Western scholars on China, in spite of debates over "matters of degree."{{sfnb|Smith|2015| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=RhmaCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=smith+qing+dynasty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDlMmSqJjQAhXGJCYKHTFfAlQQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20qing%20history&amp;f=false ix-xi]}}

==Responses==
The arguments put forward in the New Qing History inspired debate on a number of specific points.

===Dispute over term "China"===
The scholar Zhao Gang responded against the revisionist historians by noting that they claimed that the Qing used only "China" (中國) to encompass only Han people (漢人) and "[[China proper]]" and pointed out that in fact that China proper and Han people were not synonymous with "China" in the Qing view according to Mark Elliott's own work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han dynasty used Zhongguo (中國) to refer only to Han areas, but the Qing dynasty reinvented the definition of Zhongguo (中國) to refer to non-Han areas as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao Gang cited Qing documents with Qing being used for the Manchu term Dulimbai Gurun (a direct translation of "中國", Zhongguo; "Middle Kingdom") in Manchu texts and Zhongguo in Chinese texts to refer to the entire Qing including Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, and Tibet as "China", [[Names of the Qing dynasty|in official documents, edicts, treaties]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], pp. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; in texts like the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]],{{sfnp|Zhao|2006|pp=[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf 8 and 12]}} [[Treaty of Kyakhta (1727)#Convention of Kyakhta (1768)|Convention of Kyakhta]] (1768),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Qianlong Emperor#Chinese political identity and frontier policy|1755 pronouncement by the Qianlong Emperor]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Dzungar genocide#Consequences of the Genocide|Manchu language memorial on the conquest of Dzungaria]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Dulimbai+gurun+land&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jEHtUunnIIvksASBzIEQ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dulimbai%20gurun%20land&amp;f=false Dunnell 2004], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Dulimbai+gurun&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iT7tUsrhM4bhyQH_04HYBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Dulimbai%20gurun&amp;f=false Dunnell 2004], p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA503&amp;dq=steppes+mountains+rivers+Dzungar+unified+with+china&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5UHtUuvvCcu_sQStu4HYBw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=steppes%20mountains%20rivers%20Dzungar%20unified%20with%20china&amp;f=false Elliott 2001], p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Qianlong Emperor#Chinese political identity and frontier policy|Qianlong's arguments for the annexation of Xinjiang]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Dzungar genocide#Consequences of the Genocide|Qianlong's sinicization policies in parts of Xinjiang]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], p. 18, 19, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Elliott wrote that it was under the Qing that "China" transformed into a definition of referring to lands where the "state claimed sovereignty," rather than only the [[Central Plains (China)|Central Plains]] area and its people by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2658945?seq=36 Elliot 2000], p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elena Barabantseva has also noted that the Manchu referred to all subjects of the Qing empire regardless of ethnicity as "Chinese" (中國之人), and they used the term Zhongguo (中國) as a synonym for the entire Qing empire but used "Hanren" (漢人) to refer only to the core area of the empire, with the entire empire viewed as multiethnic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U3XFBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Barabantseva 2010], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph W. Esherick]] observes that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the [[Lifan Yuan]] and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of Zhongguo (中國) and made it "flexible" by using that term to refer to the entire empire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pt6wlBmUEU0C&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Esherick 2006], p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other points===
Scholars have disagreed on whether or how much the Manchu rulers used new forms of imperial ritual to display new forms of empire or continued rituals from the Ming to show that they saw themselves as heirs of a Han Chinese empire. Roger Des Forges' review of [[David M. Robinson]]'s ''Martial Spectacles of the Ming Court'' criticized scholars of conquest dynasties and New Qing History and disagreed with the idea that  the "Royal hunt" was a differing factor between Han Chinese and [[conquest dynasties]]. He noted that the martial themed Ming dynasty [[Grand Review (China)|Grand Review]] was copied by the Qing and disagreed with those who sought to present it as a Qing feature. He praised Robinson in differing from scholars who selected [[History of the Ming dynasty#Universal rulership|certain Ming and Qing emperors]] to contrast their difference and for not conflating Han with "Chinese" and not translating the term "Zhongguo".&lt;ref&gt;Roger des Forges, [http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/journal/articles/v60p299.pdf (Review)] ''Journal of Chinese Studies'' No. 60 – (January 2015) pp. 302-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Qing History, according to Tristan G. Brown, writing in 2011, did not explore the example of Islam and Muslims to test their argument that the early Qing emperors aspired to be universal monarchs. Brown finds that an inscription by the Qianlong emperor showed that he wanted to incorporate both Xinjiang and Islam into his empire and that this inscription, along with the "inventive structural duality of Chinese-Islamic architecture with Central Asian Turkish-Islamic architectural forms," makes the "most compelling case" that New Qing History is also applicable to Chinese Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first =Tristan G. |last = Brown | journal = Journal of Chinese Studies| volume =53 |date = July 2011 |title = Towards an Understanding of Qianlong's Conception of Islam: A Study of the Dedication Inscriptions of the Fragrant Concubine's Mosque in the Imperial Capital|url = http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/ics/journal/articles/v53p137.pdf |pp = 138, 145| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In China===
In the journal ''Chinese Social Sciences Today'', an official publication of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]], Li Zhiting, a scholar working on the National Qing Dynasty Compilation Committee, charged that "'New Qing History' is academically absurd, and politically does damage to the unity of China...." He sought to "expose its mask of pseudo-academic scholarship, eliminating the deleterious effect it has had on scholarship in China." Li went on to charge that the "whole range of views [New Qing History scholars] express are cliches and stereotypes, little more than dusted off versions in a scholarly tone of the Western imperialism and Japanese imperialism of the 19th century." American scholars such as Evelyn Rawski, Pamela Crossley, Mark Elliott, and James Millward, Li continued, "view the history of China from an imperialist standpoint, with imperialist points of view and imperialist eyes, regarding 'traditional' China as an 'empire,' regarding the Qing dynasty as 'Qing dynasty imperialism.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Li |first = Zhiting 李治亭| title = Scholars Criticize 'New Qing History': An Example of 'New Imperialist' History| journal = Chinese Social Sciences Today| date = April 20, 2015| ref = harv}} translated in {{Cite journal | url = http://cmp.hku.hk/2015/04/22/38664/ | last = | first = |title = A righteous view of history|journal  = China Media Project |date=April 2015| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nikoghos Tahmizian''' (1926&amp;ndash;2011, {{lang-hy|Նիկողոս Թահմիզյան}}; also spelled: Nikogos Tahmizyan) was an Armenian [[musicologist]], theorist and historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khudaverdyan|first=K.

Several dozen neumatic symbols have now been revealed, defined, categorized and interpreted as a result of his work.

His research into the musical heritage of [[Armenia]] revealed and explained the most crucial periods in the history of Armenian music and its notorious representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nikoghos Tahmizian|url=http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_biography/121721/%D0%A2%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B7%D1%8F%D0%BD|work=Extensive Biographical Encyclopedia|publisher=Academic.ru|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He brought to life the musical contributions of [[Mesrop Mashtots]](arm.

His work placed an overall historical perspective of the musical development in [[Armenia]] from 5th to 20th Centuries. He categorized the period from ancient times to the 12th century as an ascending era, and the timeframe from 13th to 18th centuries as a period of creative decline.

He also conducted extensive research into the theory of Armenian music from the pagan era to the [[church music]] of the 8th Century A.D. In his defining book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andriasov|first=Iosif|title=National Culture of Armenia|url=http://www.armchorus.ru/NacKultArmenii.html|publisher=Moscow Armenian Chamber Chorus|accessdate=7 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820034312/http://armchorus.ru/NacKultArmenii.html|archivedate=20 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  entitled 'Theory of Music in Ancient Armenia' (published in [[Armenia]], 1977, in Russian) he interpreted and classified the modal system used during this period. He also analyzed the metric and [[rhythmic]] constructs and their formational significance. He explained the uniqueness of the Armenian [[oktoechos]] and shed light upon the conceptual and aesthetical issues of the medieval music of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arevshatyan|first=Anna|title=The Armenian Medieval Commentaries on Modes|year=2003|publisher=Komitas Publishing|location=Yerevan, Armenia|isbn=99930-979-1-8|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he brought into focus the specific characteristics of the Armenian modes as compared and contrasted with Persian, Arabic, Turkish, as well as Greek, Russian and Caucasian modal systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arevshatyan|first=Anna|title=The Armenian Medieval Commentaries on Modes|year=2003|publisher=Komitas Publishing|location=Yerevan, Armenia|isbn=99930-979-1-8|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Tahmizian published over a dozen books and around two hundred articles and essays in Armenian, Russian, English, French and Polish. He has also delivered over 60 academic lectures in universities and conservatories throughout the former Soviet Union, as well as [[London]] (1978), [[Rome]] (1981), [[Tokyo]] (1985), [[Paris]] (1989), [[San Francisco]] (1990) and [[New York City]] (1993). He contributed to the Russian Music Encyclopedia (published from 1973 to 1982 in Moscow, six volumes, in Russian), and [[Armenian Encyclopedia]] (published from 1974 to 1987 in Yerevan, thirteen volumes, in Armenian).

== Brief biography ==

Born in [[Athens]], Greece on May 9, 1926. Received elementary education at the local Armenian school, followed by high school at the [[Melkonian Educational Institute]] in [[Cyprus]] on a merit based scholarship. After graduation in 1945, being recognized as a promising young musical scholar, he received a fully funded fellowship for a seven-year academic course at the Music Conservatory of Brussels, Belgium.

The "Repatriation Movement", however, initiated by the government of post-war Armenia, changed his plans. Along with over hundred thousand Armenians (scattered around the globe as a direct result of the 1915 [[Genocide]]) he moved to Soviet Armenia in 1946. In September of that year, he was admitted and started his education at the Romanos Melikian Musical College of Yerevan - graduating in 1950. From 1950 to 1956 he attended the [[Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory]], Musicology Department. He completed his graduate studies with a thesis on 13th century Armenian monk Hovhannes Yerznkatzi's views on music theory. From 1947 to 1956 Tahmizian worked at the [[Yerevan Opera House]] occupying the chair of third [[French Horn]] in the orchestra.

From 1956 to 1960 he completed his post-graduate studies at [[St. Petersburg State Conservatory]] under the mentorship of renowned music scholar Christopher Kushnarev. It was here that he met his lifetime soul mate Svetalan Nikitina (later Svetlana Tahmizian) - a talented musician studying with the famous pianist and organist Professor Braudo (Браудо, Исайя Александрович). From 1960 to 1990 he was a senior researcher at [[Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts]] (Matenadaran) in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]. During the same period he actively collaborated with the Composers' Union of Armenia, [[Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory]] and the [[Armenian National Academy of Sciences]]. Tahmizian upheld his dissertation for doctoral candidacy in 1962 on the history of Armenian music from 5th to 8th centuries A.D. In 1980 he obtained an honorary doctorate degree presenting the publication of his monumental work "Theory of Music in Ancient Armenia."

In 1984 he was awarded an honorary title for his accomplishments in musical arts by the government of the Republic of Armenia. In 1987 he was granted professorship of musical sciences by the music history department of the [[Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory]].

From 1990 to 2011 he resided in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]]. He was honored to become a US citizen in 1995. During this time he continued his research and involvement in Armenian music history. He published five books and a dozen articles. He also lectured in various US cities.

[[File:One-Mensch-Theater.NatiasNeutert,1982.jpg|thumb|One-Mensch-Theater Natias Neutert, at «Arena», Vienna 1982]]
'''Ein-Mensch-Theater''' ({{lang-de|Mensch|links=no}} "human being") is a [[Germany|German]] expression for a traveling theater, within the owner is writer, director, stage designer, performer and sometimes even his own tour manager in one person.&lt;ref&gt;A definition, corresponding with ''The poor Theater'' and its imagination power. Cf. [[Jerzy Grotowski]]: ''Towards a Poor Theatre'' (Preface: [[Peter Brook]]/Edited by [[Eugenio Barba]]). Eyre Metghuen, London 1980. {{ISBN|978-0-413-34910-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dario Fo-Cesena.jpg|left|thumb|Nobel Prize winner [[Dario Fo]] in Cesena, Italy, 2008]]
[[File:Johnny Melville.jpg|thumb|Johnny Melville, 2012]]
==Origin==
The term was coined by [[Natias Neutert]] after his performance (''The poet stumbles into the open'') at [[Schauspielhaus Bochum]] during a panel discussion with [[Peter Zadek]]&lt;ref&gt;DIE ZEIT No. 32, 4 August 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Robert Kreis - Februar 2013.jpg|thumb|Robert Kreis at «Peety's», Köln 2013]]
==Goal==
His intention was going to replace the worn and partial label ''one-man show'' by a label under which both males and females could find equally.&lt;ref&gt;So Neutert in the panel discussion at [[Schauspielhaus Bochum]], August 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exponents==
[[Dario Fo]], Robert Kreis, Johnny Melville, Natias Neutert and Franca Rame became famous exponents as this type of theater in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.Hannes Heer (Ed.), Dario Fo über Dario Fo. Übersetzt aus dem Italienischen von Ulrich Enzensberger. Prometh Köln, 1980 {{ISBN|3922009115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology''' is a [[museum]] affiliated with [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Founded in 1866, the Peabody Museum is one of the oldest and largest museums focusing on [[anthropology|anthropological]] material, with particular focus on the [[ethnography]] and [[archaeology of the Americas]]. The museum is caretaker to over 1.2 million objects, some 900 linear feet of documents, 2,000 maps and site plans, and approximately 500,000 photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peabody Museum Collections|url=https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/collections|website=www.peabody.harvard.edu|publisher=Peabody Museum|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is located at Divinity Avenue on the Harvard University campus. The museum is one of the four Harvard Museums of Science &amp; Culture open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Museums of Science and Culture-About|url=http://hmsc.harvard.edu/fourmuseums|website=Harvard Museums of Science and Culture|publisher=Harvard Museums of Science and Culture|accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The museum was established as a gift from [[George Peabody]], a native of South Danvers (now [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]]), a wealthy American financier and philanthropist on October 8, 1866.&lt;ref name=Watson--pg4-5&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=Rubie|title=Opening the Museum: The Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|date=2001|publisher=The Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University|location=Cambridge (Mass.)|isbn=0-87365-839-6|pages=4–5|url=https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/files/Opening_the_Museum_150dpi.pdf|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peabody committed $150,000 to be used, according to the terms of the trust, to establish the position of Peabody Professor-Curator, to purchase artifacts, and to construct a building to house its collections. Peabody directed his trustees to organize the construction of "a suitable fireproof museum building, upon land to be given for that purpose, free of cost or rental, by the President and Fellows of Harvard College."&lt;ref name=Watson--pg4-5/&gt; The museum opened its first exhibition consisting of a small number of prehistoric artifacts from the [[Merrimack Valley]] in Harvard University's Boylston Hall in 1867. In 1877, the long-awaited museum building was completed and ready for occupancy. The building that houses the Peabody was expanded in 1888 and again in 1913.

==Collections==
Peabody Museum is steward to archaeological, ethnographic, [[Osteology|osteological]], and archival collections from many countries and covering millions of years of human cultural, social, and biological history, with particular focus on the cultures of North and South America and the [[Pacific Islands]], as well as collections from Africa, Europe, and Asia.

* [[North America]]. The Peabody’s archaeological and ethnographic holdings from North America form more than a quarter of its collections, with artifacts from many parts of the continent and spanning 10,000 years, including from the earliest excavations in the Northeast and Mimbres collections from the Southwest, the [[Grace Nicholson]] Collection of California baskets, and the [[Lewis and Clark]] Collection.
* Central America. The museum’s Central American collection focuses on archaeological materials from eastern [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], lower [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]] islands and Central [[Mexico]]. The museum hosts a large collection of [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n material culture from [[Copán]], [[Holmul]], [[Labna]], [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], and [[Uaxactun]], stone sculptures from [[Copán]], fine artifacts from the Sacred Cenote of [[Chichén Itza]], and 600 plaster casts of monuments at important Central American sites.
* South America. Some of the Peabody’s earliest accessions, collected by [[Louis Agassiz]] and his son [[Alexander Emanuel Agassiz]], form the main part of the Peabody's South American ethnographic collections. These include the collection of nineteenth- and twentieth-century [[featherwork]] [[headdress]]es and ornaments from the [[Amazon Basin]], [[Andean textiles]] and the [[William Farabee]] collection of [[Bolivia]]n and [[Peru]]vian ceremonial and domestic objects. Important archaeological collections include [[Chimú culture|Chimú]], [[Nazca culture|Nazca]], and [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] pottery; [[Inca Empire|Inca]] and Chimú metalwork; and a collection of prehistoric-period textiles.
* Asia. The museum’s Asian holdings include one of the earliest collections of objects made and used by the [[Ainu people]], Japan’s indigenous people; [[Japanese ceramics|Japanese]] and [[Chinese ceramics]] and porcelains; colorful textiles made by the [[Kachin people]] living in northeastern [[Myanmar]] (Burma) and contiguous areas of India and China, by the [[Shan people]], and [[Siberia]]n hide costumes and carved wooden household items. Archaeological materials dominate the Asia collections with an extensive collection of excavated artifacts from [[Tepe Yahya]] (Iran) and [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] (Turkey).
* Africa. The museum’s holdings include over 20,000 items in four significant collections. The three principal collections, gathered from [[Liberia]], southern [[Cameroon]] and [[Uganda]] during the first half of the twentieth century, include a diverse range of objects used in daily or ritual life. The fourth collection contains more than 200 musical instruments including drums and hand pianos. Archaeological collections are represented by [[George Andrew Reisner]]'s excavations in [[Egypt]] and [[Nubia]].
* Oceania. Collected by eighteenth-century Boston merchants, traders, and researchers during their Pacific voyages the 23,000 items of this collection include [[Easter Island]] [[tapa cloth|tapa]] figures and carved wooden statues; [[Hawaii]]an [[feather cloak]]s and [[Mahiole]] feather helmets; [[Māori people|Maori]] carved [[whakairo]] door panels, bowls, and human figures; [[Java]]nese [[wayang]] [[shadow puppet]]s; and [[Micronesia]]n canoes and [[shell jewelry]].
* Europe. In addition to [[Paleolithic]] collections from France, especially from the site of [[Abri Pataud]] where [[Cro-Magnon]] man once lived, there are materials from [[Neolithic]] through [[Iron Age Europe]], with the notable collection of the [[Duchess Marie Antoinette of Mecklenburg]] materials, excavated at [[Hallstatt Archaeological Site in Vače]], [[Slovenia]], surveyed by her mother [[Princess Marie of Windisch-Graetz]]. The collection also includes a portion of the French archaeologist and political activist [[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet]]’s collections from Central Europe, a [[Venus figurine]] from the [[Grimaldi Man]] caves in Italy, and Neolithic [[stone tool]]s from northwestern Europe.
* Paintings and Drawing Collections. Numbering nearly 200 paintings and 950 works on paper, the collection of artwork is a complementary addition to the object collections. About half, representing the David I. Bushnell, Jr. Collection of American Art, contains works by Alexander de Batz, [[George Catlin]], [[Charles Bird King]], George Gibbs, [[Edward Kern]], [[John Webber]], and over 130 oils, watercolors, and drawings by [[Seth Eastman]], the pictorial historian of native North Americans. There are also painted portraits of Native Americans by [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank]], some being the only extant representation of the subject. Other significant pieces include the works of [[Jean Charlot]] depicting the monumental architecture of Mesoamerica, twentieth-century works by Native American artists, an extensive series of [[Inuit art|Inuit]] prints, and thirty-eight works depicting people and places in India and Tibet by Andre Chéronnet Champollion.
* Archival Collections. The holdings of both the records and photographic archives present another dimension to the scholarly work of the anthropologists and archaeologists whose collected artifacts reside in the Peabody. The papers and manuscripts housed in the archives include institutional (departmental and Museum) records, special collections, and materials associated with over 70 anthropological/archaeological expeditions, dozens of faculty and researchers, and other research projects. The [[daguerreotype]]s, colored [[Transparency (projection)|transparencies]], and other photographic images in the Peabody’s collections number about half a million from the archaeology and ethnology of many countries, with particular emphasis in Native American cultures and portraits, Mexico, northern Central America, China and Southwest Asia, Africa, and [[Pre-Columbian art|pre-Columbian]] objects and art.
* Osteological Collections. The osteological collections of the Peabody Museum derive from more than eighty countries on six continents and include human and non-human [[primate]] remains, fossils, and casts. These are collected mainly from the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa. Approximately 40 percent of the more than 18,500 human and non-human individuals (MNI) currently represented in the collections are from the United States. The museum also has anatomical teaching and [[hominid]] cast collections.

==Background==

Broué was born in [[Privas]], [[Ardèche]], around 1926.&lt;ref name=bensaid /&gt;

His father was a civil servant and mother a school teacher:  they had "strong republican views".&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

==Career==

In 1936, Broué supported a French general strike as well as the Spanish Republic.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

By 1940, with Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia in [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|a non-aggression pact]], he helped organize a Communist party cell at the [[Lycée Henri IV]] in Paris.  The [[French Communist Party]] expelled these organizers; they said Broué suffered from Trotskyism.  The accusation piqued his interest, and he began reading about Trotsky from the private library of teacher [[Élie Reynier]].&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=bensaid /&gt;&lt;ref name=bensaid /&gt;

With the Party, he fought in the [[French resistance]] against Nazi occupiers during [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref name=IMT /&gt;&lt;ref name=bensaid /&gt;

When [[Joseph Stalin]] disbanded the [[Comintern]] in 1943, Broué became strongly critical of [[Stalinism]], resigning from the FCP as a result. By 1944, he became a Trotskyist, joined the [[Fourth International]], and remained a Trotskyist for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=birchall /&gt;&lt;ref name=bensaid /&gt;

In 1952, he followed [[Pierre Lambert]] during a split in the movement and continued as a "Lambertist" for many years.&lt;ref name=bensaid /&gt;

He was active in the [[Internationalist Communist Party]] and then the [[Internationalist Communist Organisation]] before expelled in 1989.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=IMT /&gt;&lt;ref name=bensaid /&gt;

He became a secondary school teacher, until 1965 when he became lecturer in history at the [[University of Grenoble]] and then professor.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=birchall /&gt;&lt;ref name=bensaid /&gt;

In 1977, he set up the [[Trotsky Institute]], to publish in French all of Trotsky's writings (so far, 27 volumes). He also founded and edited the ''[[Cahiers Léon Trotsky]]'', devoted to the history of Trotskyism.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=bensaid /&gt;

Between 2003 and his death, he was a close collaborator and supporter of the [[International Marxist Tendency]].&lt;ref name=IMT /&gt;

==Personal life==

Broué married three times.  His third wife Andrée died in 1989 from cancer.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

Former student [[Jean-Pierre Juy]] was a long-time friend. [[Alan Woods (political theorist)|Alan Woods]] was a late-life friend and admirer.&lt;ref name=IMT /&gt;&lt;ref name=birchall /&gt;

Broué died in [[Grenoble]], France, in his sleep in the early hours July 27, 2005, age 79. He had prostate cancer.  Five children survived him:  two sons and three daughters.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

His son [[Michel Broué]] is a notable mathematician.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

== Works ==

The basic inspiration for Broué's books was his desire to explain Stalinism.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

His book ''Trotsky'' (1988) counters the work of [[Isaac Deutscher]].  He worked for three years at Harvard, to which Trotsky had sold his papers in 1940.  Broué and assistants were the first researchers to use them since the archive opened in 1980.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; [[Alan Woods (political theorist)|Alan Woods]] has called it "a very healthy antidote to the superficial and pretentious philistinism of Isaac Deutscher".&lt;ref name=IMT /&gt;&lt;ref name=bensaid /&gt;

The recent republication of Trotsky's autobiography, ''My Life'', has a foreword written by Broué.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">[[File:Milan - Pinacothèque de Brera - Cour intérieure.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] in [[Milan]].]]
A '''pinacotheca''' ({{lang-la|pinacotheca}} borrowed from {{lang-el|πινακοθήκη}}, πίναξ "(painted) board, tablet" + θήκη "box, chest") was a picture gallery in either [[ancient Greece]] or [[ancient Rome]]. The name is specifically used for the building containing pictures which formed the left wing of the [[Propylaea]] on the [[Acropolis]] at [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. The Pinacotheca was located right by the [[temple of Athena Nike]]. Though [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (Bk. I., xxii. 6) speaks of the pictures "which time had not effaced," which seems to point to [[fresco painting]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}, the fact that there is no trace of preparation for [[stucco]] on the walls shows that the paintings were [[easel]] pictures ([[J. G. Frazer]], ''Pausanias's Description of Greece'', 1898, ii. 252). The Romans adopted the term for the room in a private house containing pictures, statues, and other works of art.

In the modern world the word is often used as a name for a public [[art gallery]] concentrating on paintings, mostly in Italy (as "Pinacoteca"), such as the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]] of the [[Vatican Museums]] (which is usually meant when the plain word is used), the [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] in Milan (more often "the Brera" informally), with others in [[Bologna]], [[Siena]], and [[Turin]]. In [[Brazil]], there is the [[Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo]]. In [[Paris]], the [[Pinacothèque de Paris]]. In [[Munich]] the three main galleries are called the [[Alte Pinakothek]] ([[old master]]s), [[Neue Pinakothek]] (19th century) and [[Pinakothek der Moderne]]. At Hallbergmoos, near Munich Airport, there was the Pinakothek Hallbergmoos (20th and 21st century) between 2010 and 2014.

'''Richard Robert Madden''' (22 August 1798 &amp;ndash; 5 February 1886) was an Irish doctor, writer, [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] and historian of the [[United Irishmen]]. Madden took an active role in trying to impose anti-slavery rules in [[Jamaica]] on behalf of the British government.

==Early life==
[[File:(1829) MADDEN, Richard Robert in Syrian Costume.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Madden undercover in [[Syria]], exploring the Ottoman Empire]]
Madden was born at [[Wormwood Gate]] Dublin on 22 August 1798 to Edward Madden, a silk manufacturer and his wife Elizabeth (born Corey) .&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{cite odnb|title=Madden, Richard Robert (1798–1886)|first=Lynn|last=Milne|id=17753|accessedate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had married twice and fathered twenty-one children.&lt;ref name=bettersource&gt;[http://www.egypt-sudan-graffiti.be/Richard-Robert-Madden.htm Richard Robert Madden], egypt-sudan-graffiti.be, Retrieved 16 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

Madden attended private schools and was found a medical apprenticeship in [[Athboy]], [[Co. Meath]]. He studied medicine in Paris, Italy, and St George's Hospital, London. While in [[Naples]] he became acquainted with [[Marguerite, Countess of Blessington|Lady Blessington]] and her circle. From 1824 to 1827 he was in the [[Levant]] as a journalist, and later published accounts of his travels.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

In 1828 Madden married Harriet Elmslie, daughter of John Elmslie (1739–1822) of Jamaica, a slave-owner. He then for five years practised medicine in [[Mayfair]], London.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LBS"&gt;{{citation|url = https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/2146641017|access-date = 17 February 2016|title = Legacies of British Slave-ownership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolitionist in Jamaica==
Madden became a recruit to the abolitionist cause. The [[slave trade]] had been illegal in the British Empire since 1807, but slavery still existed. The slave trade continued, and many not actively involved were complicit with it.&lt;ref name=murray&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=David.R.|title=Richard Robert Madden|date=1972|jstor=30088913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1833, Madden was employed in the British civil service, first as a [[justice of the peace]] in Jamaica, where he was one of six Special Magistrates sent to oversee the eventual liberation of Jamaica's slave population, according to the terms of the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. From 1835 he was Superintendent of the freed Africans in [[Havana]]. In 1839 he became the investigating officer into the slave trade on the west coast of Africa, in 1847 the secretary for the [[Swan River Colony]]. He returned to Dublin and in 1850 he was named secretary of the Office for Loan Funds in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boylan|first= Henry |year=1998|title=A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition|pages=262|location=Dublin|publisher=Gill and MacMillan|isbn=0-7171-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Madden died at his home in [[Booterstown]], just south of Dublin city, in 1886 and is interred in [[Donnybrook Cemetery]].

'''Saint Thomas Christian music''' refers to the [[music]]al traditions of the [[Saint Thomas Christian]] community of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. It is chiefly [[liturgical music|liturgical]] and is derived from ancient [[Syriac Christian]] music from the [[Middle East]], with remarkably little influence from local Indian styles. Of particular significance is the prevalence of the [[organum]] singing style. As a result of the community's isolation and conservatism, these traditions may retain elements of the earliest forms of [[Early Christian music]].

==History==
The [[Saint Thomas Christians]] trace their origins to the evangelical activity of [[Thomas the Apostle]] in the 1st century. The community grew under the influence of migration from Syrians, members of the [[Church of the East]]. The community's modern musical traditions may be derived from this connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 83–85|publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Into the 20th century, Saint Thomas Christian liturgy was performed and sung in the [[Syriac language]], though today this largely has been replaced with the local language, [[Malayalam]].&lt;ref name=Ross85&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |page= 85|publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the community's resistance to outside influence and isolation, the music of the Saint Thomas Christians may preserve elements of the earliest forms of Christian music.&lt;ref name=Ross80&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |page= 80 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Israel G. Ross compares Saint Thomas Christian music to that of the [[Jews]] in Kerala. [[Jewish music]] influenced the early Christian music ancestral to the Saint Thomas Christian forms, and Jews have lived in similar conditions to the Thomas Christians in [[Kerala]] for centuries.&lt;ref name=Ross80/&gt; As such, Christian and Jewish music and culture in Kerala feature many parallels and similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 80–81 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a Saint Thomas Christian blessing given by a dying father to his children is similar to the Jewish [[Amidah]].&lt;ref name=Ross85&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |page= 82|publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt; These similarities may reflect a common origin in the ancient Middle East.&lt;ref name=Ross88&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 88 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Thomas Christian music derives from archaic Syriac forms, with little discernible influence from [[Indian classical music]] or other local traditions.&lt;ref name=Ross80/&gt; [[Liturgical music]] is performed in two [[mode (music)|modes]]: ''kadmoyo'' and ''hamisoyo''. These are similar to the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[maqama]]t'' and may be derived from an ancient [[Syriac sacral music|Syriac system]] that existed in the Middle East in the early centuries of Christianity, and which may be related to the system known as [[oktoechos]].&lt;ref name=Ross85/&gt; Intonation is similar to the Syriac standard, featuring no [[augmented second]] or [[microtonal]] alteration characteristic of Indian music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 86 |publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[organum]] singing style is common in Saint Thomas Christian music. It appears in [[antiphons]], [[responsory|responsories]], and [[hymn]]s. Ross notes that this is found among three other disparate and isolated cultures: the nearby [[Cochin Jews]], the [[Yemenite Jews]], and the [[Samaritans]]. Organum may be sung in either duplum or triplum.  In the former it is sung in the [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] when the boys and men sing together with the [[cantus firmus]] in the upper voice, or in the [[perfect fourth|fourth]] when the groups sing alone. In triplum it is sung in the fourth and octave.&lt;ref name=Ross88/&gt;

The [[Margam Kali]] is a traditional Saint Thomas Christian dance. The accompanying music is performed by a choir singing in Syriac chant, with a ''sleeyankolu'' ([[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]) maintaining rhythm. Another traditional instrument is the [[violin]] or ''revekka''.&lt;ref name= Choondal&gt;Chummar Choondal (1983). "Christian folk songs". ''Kerala Folklore Academy'', p 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chant accentuation==
Traditional chant accentuation derives from the Syriac standard, which was instituted by the scholars known as the [[Masoretes]] in the Middle Ages. The form is similar to that codified by the [[Hebrew]] [[Linguist|grammarians]] of [[Tiberias]] for Jewish cantillation of the Bible. It features dot notation above, below, and to the side of words in the text. The names of the notations are expressive, reflecting the style of Syriac Bible reading and chant in general.&lt;ref name=Ross83&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Israel J. |year= 1980 |title= Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala |journal= Asian Music |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 83|publisher= University of Texas Press|jstor= 833968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thoma Parvam==
One important Saint Thomas Christian song is the "Thoma Parvam", or "Song of Thomas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Christianity in India: From Beginnings to the Present |last= Frykenberg |first= Eric |year= 2008 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 0-19-826377-5 |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song contains a [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]] claiming it was first written in 1601 by a certain Maliekel Thoma Ramban, though the manuscripts are of a much later date. The words give an account of [[Thomas the Apostle]]'s purported evangelical work in India in the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thoma |first1= P.

The '''Slater Mill''' is a historic textile mill complex on the banks of the [[Blackstone River]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]], modeled after cotton spinning mills first established in England. It is the first water-powered cotton spinning mill in North America to utilize the Arkwright system of cotton spinning as developed by [[Richard Arkwright]].

[[Samuel Slater]], the mill's founder, apprenticed as a young man in [[Belper]], England with industrialist [[Jedediah Strutt]]. Shortly after immigrating to the United States, Slater was hired by [[Moses Brown (Providence)|Moses Brown]] of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] to produce a working set of machines necessary to spin cotton yarn using water power. Construction of the machines was completed in 1793, as well as a dam, waterway, waterwheel, and mill. Manufacturing was based on [[Richard Arkwright]]'s cotton spinning system, which included carding, drawing, and spinning machines. Slater initially hired children and families to work in his mill, establishing a pattern that was replicated throughout the [[Blackstone Valley]] and known as the "[[Rhode Island System]]". It was later eclipsed by [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]]'s [[Waltham System]].

Slater Mill was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and designated a National Historic Landmark on November 13, 1966, the first property to be listed on the register.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;Blanche Higgins Schroer (September 15, 1975) {{NHLS url|id=66000001|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Old Slater Mill / Old Slater Mill; Slater Mill Historic Site}}, National Park Service and {{NHLS url|id=66000001|title=''Accompanying 6 images, including print from ca. 1812, drawing from 1907, and photos from 1973 and 1974 and undated''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt; In December 2014, the mill was added to the newly formed [[Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park]].

==Architectural history==

The original portion of the Slater Mill built in 1793 was six [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] long and two stories tall. Several additions were made beginning in 1801, and a second added in 1835. Between 1869 and 1872, a large addition was made to the north end of the mill. Cotton spinning continued until 1895, after which the mill was used for various industrial purposes until 1923. The building had suffered numerous fires in the past, and two fires occurred in 1912 which precipitated awareness of the building and the need for its preservation.

==From mill to museum==
In 1921, the non-profit Old Slater Mill Association was founded with the purpose of saving the historic Mill. Efforts to restore the mill began in 1923; modern additions to the structure were removed, restoring the mill to its 1835 appearance. In 1955, it opened as a museum. Restoration of the nearby [[Wilkinson Mill]] (built 1810–1811) was completed in 1978 as part of the Slater Mill site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/ri/ri0400/ri0471/supp/ri0471supp.pdf |title=Slater's Mill, supplemental information |last=Creer |first=Philip D. |date=April 10, 1942 |website=Historic American Buildings Survey |publisher=Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1 |accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slater Mill site now serves as a museum, educational center, and music venue, which "celebrates innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit by engaging audiences in relevant cultural, historic, and artistic endeavors". It includes five acres of land on both sides of the Blackstone River, a dam on the river, two historic mills (the Slater Mill and Wilkinson Mill), and the Sylvanus Brown House (a house built in 1758 but moved to the site in the 1960s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slatermill.org/ |title=Slater Mill |accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|Tetsuro Watsuji|和辻 哲郎|Watsuji Tetsurō|lead=yes}} (March 1, 1889 – December 26, 1960) was a [[Japan]]ese [[Ethics|moral philosopher]], [[Cultural history|cultural historian]], and [[Intellectual history|intellectual historian]].

==Early life==
Watsuji was born in [[Himeji, Hyōgo|Himeji]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture]] to a physician. During his youth he enjoyed poetry and had a passion for [[Western literature]]. For a short time he was the coeditor of a literary magazine and was involved in writing poems and plays. His interests in philosophy came to light while he was a student at First Higher School in Tokyo, although his interest in literature would always remain strong throughout his life.

In his early writings (between 1913 and 1915) he introduced the work of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] to Japan, as well as working on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], but in 1918 he turned against this earlier position, criticizing Western philosophical [[individualism]], and attacking its influence on Japanese thought and life. This led to a study of the roots of Japanese culture, including Japanese [[Buddhist art]], and notably the work of the medieval [[Zen Buddhism|Zen Buddhist]] [[Dōgen]]. Watsuji was also interested in the famous Japanese writer [[Natsume Sōseki]], whose books were influential during Watsuji's early years.

==Career==
In the early 1920s Watsuji taught at [[Toyo University|Toyo]], [[Hosei University|Hosei]] and [[Keio University|Keio]] universities, and at [[Tsuda College|Tsuda Eigaku-juku]].&lt;ref&gt;David A. Dilworth, et al., ''Sourcebook for Modern Japanese Philosophy: Selected Documents'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press); cited in Robert Carter, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/watsuji-tetsuro/ Watsuji Tetsurô]", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues of [[hermeneutics]] attracted his attention.&lt;ref&gt;Marra, Michael F. (2002). {{google books|VCcLEBldTagC|''Japanese hermeneutics,'' pp. 76-88.|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 Watsuji became professor of ethics at [[Kyoto University]], joining the other leading philosophers of the time, [[Nishida Kitaro]] and [[Tanabe Hajime]]. He then moved to the Tokyo Imperial University in 1934 and held the chair in ethics until 1949.

During [[World War II]] his theories (which claimed the superiority of Japanese approaches to and understanding of human nature and ethics, and argued for the negation of self) provided support for [[Japanese nationalism]], a fact which, after the war, he said that he regretted.

Watsuji died at the age of seventy-one.

==Work==
Watsuji's three main works were his two-volume 1954 ''History of Japanese Ethical Thought'', his three-volume ''Rinrigaku'' (''[[Ethics (Watsuji)|Ethics]]''), first published in 1937, 1942, and 1949, and his 1935 ''Fūdo''. The last of these develops his most distinctive thought. In it, Watsuji argues for an essential relationship between [[climate]] and other environmental factors and the nature of human [[culture]]s, and he distinguished three types of culture: pastoral, desert, and monsoon.&lt;ref&gt;The [[France|French]] philosopher [[Montesquieu]] had developed a theory along similar lines, though with very different conclusions.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Thirteenth Tribe''''' is a 1976 book by [[Arthur Koestler]], in which the author advances the thesis that [[Ashkenazi Jews]] are not descended from the historical [[Israelite]]s of antiquity, but from [[Khazars]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]]. Koestler hypothesized that the Khazars (who converted to [[Judaism]] in the 8th century) migrated westwards into Eastern Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries when the Khazar Empire was collapsing.

Koestler used previous works by  [[Douglas Morton Dunlop]], [[Raphael Patai]] and Abraham Poliak as sources. His stated intent was to make [[antisemitism]] disappear by disproving its racial basis.

==Summary==

===Contents===
In the book, Koestler advances the thesis that [[Ashkenazi Jews]] are not descended from the historical [[Israelite]]s of antiquity, but from [[Khazars]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]] originating in and populating an empire north of and between the [[Black Sea]] and [[Caspian Sea]]. Koestler's hypothesis is that the Khazars – who converted to [[Judaism]] in the 8th century – migrated westwards into current Eastern Europe (primarily [[Ukraine]], Poland, [[Belarus]], [[Lithuania]], [[Hungary]] and Germany) in the 12th and 13th centuries when the Khazar Empire was collapsing.

At the end of the book's last chapter, Koestler summarizes its content and his intentions as follows: "In Part One of this book I have attempted to trace the history of the Khazar Empire based on the scant existing sources. In Part Two, Chapters V-VII, I have compiled the historical evidence which indicates that the bulk of Eastern Jewry — and hence of world Jewry — is of Khazar-Turkish, rather than Semitic, origin. In the last chapter I have tried to show that the evidence from anthropology concurs with history in refuting the popular belief in a Jewish race descended from the biblical tribe."

===Sources===
[[Mattias Gardell]] writes that Koestler's thesis is "partly based on amateur anthropology",&lt;ref name=Gardell2003p124/&gt; and its scientific arguments come from ''The Myth of a Jewish Race'' (1975) by [[Raphael Patai]] and his daughter Jennifer.&lt;ref name=Bialep359&gt;Biale, David.

===Koestler's reason for writing it===
Koestler biographer [[Michael Scammell]] writes that Koestler told French biologist Pierre Debray-Ritzen he "was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of Eastern European Jews (the ancestors of today's Ashkenazim) were descended from the Khazars, the racial basis for anti-Semitism would be removed and anti-Semitism itself could disappear".&lt;ref name=Scammell2009p546&gt;[[Michael Scammell|Scammell, Michael]]. ''Koestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth-Century Skeptic'', [[Random House]], 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-394-57630-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bO7ANkFkH0UC&amp;pg=PA546 p. 546.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[George Urban]], Koestler's desire to connect Ashkenazi Jews with Khazars was "based on a tacit belief that the intellectual brilliance of and international influence of Hungarians and Jews, especially Hungarian Jews or Jewish-Hungarians, was due to some unexplained but clearly ancient affinity between the two peoples".&lt;ref name=Urban1997p200&gt;[[George Urban|Urban, George]]. ''Radio Free Europe and the Pursuit of Democracy'', [[Yale University Press]], 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-300-06921-1}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In ''[[The Invention of the Jewish People]]'', [[Shlomo Sand]], historian of cinema, French intellectual history, and nationalism at [[Tel Aviv University]], writes "while the Khazars scared off the Israeli historians, not one of whom has published a single paper on the subject, Koestler's ''Thirteenth Tribe'' annoyed and provoked angry responses. Hebrew readers had no access to the book itself for many years, learning about it only through the venomous denunciations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Shlomo Sand|Sand, Shlomo]]. ''The Invention of the Jewish People'', [[Verso Books]], 2009, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education|Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' editor Evan Goldstein states "Sand suggests that those who attacked Koestler's book did so not because it lacked merit, but because the critics were cowards and ideologues. 'No one wants to go looking under stones when venomous scorpions might be lurking beneath them, waiting to attack the self-image of the existing ethnos and its territorial ambitions.'"&lt;ref name=GoldsteinWSJ2009&gt;Goldstein, Evan R. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703746604574464023091024180 "Where Do Jews Come From?"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 29 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Arab world the theory espoused in Koestler's book was adopted by persons who argued that if Ashkenazi Jews are primarily Khazar and not Semitic in origin, they would have no historical claim to Israel, nor would they be the subject of the [[Bible|Biblical]] promise of [[Canaan]] to the [[Israelite]]s, thus undermining the theological basis of both [[Religious Zionism|Jewish religious Zionists]] and [[Christian Zionism|Christian Zionists]].&lt;ref&gt;See:

[http://www.tabletmag.com/news-and-politics/18203/inventing-israel/ "Inventing Israel"], ''[[Tablet Magazine]]'', 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Barkun]] writes that Koestler was apparently "either unaware of or oblivious to the use anti-Semites had made of the Khazar theory since its introduction at the turn of the century."&lt;ref name = Barkun1994pp144-145/&gt;

==Assessment==
After it was first published, Fitzroy Maclean in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' called ''The Thirteenth Tribe'' excellent, writing "Mr. Koestler's book is as readable as it is thought-provoking. Nothing could be more stimulating than the skill, elegance and erudition with which he marshals his facts and develops his theories."&lt;ref name=Maclean1976&gt;Maclean, Fitzroy. [http://partners.nytimes.com/books/00/01/02/specials/koestler-tribe.html "Shalom Yisrah"], ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', 29 August 1976, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the work in the ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'' in 1991, journalist and author Grace Halsell described it as a "carefully researched book" that "refutes the idea of a Jewish 'race'."&lt;ref&gt;Halsell, Grace. [http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0591/9105071.htm "Book Reviews. The Thirteenth Tribe"], ''[[Washington Report on Middle East Affairs]]'', May/June 1991, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some positive reviews in the press, James A. Beverley writes "When ''The Thirteenth Tribe'' was released, the academic critique of its research was prompt, public, and generally negative",&lt;ref name=Beverley2009p342&gt;Beverley, James A. ''Nelson's Illustrated Guide to Religions'', [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]], 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-7852-4491-2}}, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; and Evan Goldstein states that it was "savaged by critics".&lt;ref name=GoldsteinWSJ2009/&gt; An August 1976 review in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] described Koestler's theory as "all too facile, despite the obvious effort and time the author spent on his study", and stated that "Koestler offers a blizzard of information but not enough hard facts to support his thesis".&lt;ref name=Time1976&gt;Sheppard, R.Z. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945678-2,00.html#ixzz1JSmlUDc2 "Books: Caucasian Connection"], [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], 23 August 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; A November 1976 review in ''[[National Review]]'' stated that the work had "neither the value of a well-executed honest piece of scholarship nor the emotional appeal of a polemic – only the earmarks of a poorly researched and hastily written book".&lt;ref name=Blumstock1986p94&gt;Majeski, Jane. "Chutzpah: The Thirteenth Tribe, by Arthur Koestler", ''[[National Review]]'' '''27''', 12 November 1976, p. 1248, cited in Blumstock, Robert. "Going Home: Arthur Koestler's Thirteenth Tribe", ''Jewish Social Studies'' '''48''':2, 1986, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Koestler's analysis was described as a mixture of flawed etymologies and misinterpreted primary sources by Chimen Abramsky in 1976 and [[Hyam Maccoby]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Abramsky, Chimen. "The Khazar Myth", ''Jewish Chronicle'', '''19''', 9 April 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyam Maccoby|Maccoby, Hyam]]. "Koestler's Racism", ''Midstream'', '''23''', March 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barkun describes the book as an "eccentric work", and writes that Koestler was "unequipped with the specialist background the subject might be thought to require", but that he "nevertheless made an amateur's serious attempt to investigate and support the theory."&lt;ref name = Barkun1994pp144-145/&gt; Professor of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish history]] [[Gershon D. Hundert]] wrote in 2006 "There is no evidence to support the theory that the ancestors of Polish Jewry were Jews who came from the Crimean Jewish kingdom of Khazaria", describing Koestler as the "best-known advocate" of the theory.&lt;ref name=Hundert2006p6/&gt; In 2009, [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] wrote that the book was "a combination of discredited and forgotten [ideas]".&lt;ref name=GoldsteinTablet2009/&gt;

Koestler biographers have also been critical of the work. In ''Arthur Koestler: The Homeless Mind'' (1998), [[David Cesarani]] states it makes "selective use of facts for a grossly polemical end" and is "risible as scholarship".&lt;ref name=McInnes1999/&gt; In ''Koestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth-Century Skeptic'' (2009), [[Michael Scammell]] writes that Koestler's theory "was almost entirely hypothetical and based on the slenderest of circumstantial evidence",&lt;ref name=Scammell2009p546/&gt; and takes the book as evidence that Koestler's brain "was starting to fail him".&lt;ref name=Scammell2009p548&gt;[[Michael Scammell|Scammell, Michael]]. ''Koestler: The Literary and Political Odyssey of a Twentieth-Century Skeptic'', [[Random House]], 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-394-57630-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bO7ANkFkH0UC&amp;pg=PA548 p. 548.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic research ===
A 2005 study by Nebel ''et al.'', based on Y chromosome polymorphic markers, showed that [[Ashkenazi Jews]] are more closely related to other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than to the populations among whom they lived in Europe. However, 11.5% of male Ashkenazim were found to belong to [[Haplogroup R1a]], the dominant Y chromosome haplogroup in Eastern Europeans, suggesting possible gene flow. Referencing ''The Thirteenth Tribe'', the study's authors note that "Some authors argue that after the fall of their kingdom in the second half of the 10th century CE, the Khazar converts were absorbed by the emerging Ashkenazi Jewish community in Eastern Europe." They conclude: "However, if the R-M17 chromosomes in Ashkenazi Jews do indeed represent the vestiges of the mysterious Khazars then, according to our data, this contribution was limited to either a single founder or a few closely related men, and does not exceed ~ 12% of the present-day Ashkenazim".&lt;ref&gt;Almut Nebel, Dvora Filon, Marina Faerman, Himla Soodyall and Ariella Oppenheim. [http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v13/n3/full/5201319a.html "Y chromosome evidence for a founder effect in Ashkenazi Jews"], ''[[European Journal of Human Genetics]]'', (2005) 13, 388–391. {{doi|10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201319}} {{PMID|15523495}} (Published online 3 November 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'', Michael Balter states Koestler's thesis "clash[es] with several recent studies suggesting that [[Jewishness]], including the Ashkenazi version, has deep genetic roots." He refers to a 2010 study by geneticist [[Harry Ostrer]] which found that Ashkenazi Jews "clustered more closely with Middle Eastern and Sephardic Jews, a finding the researchers say is inconsistent with the Khazar hypothesis" and concludes "that all three Jewish groups—Middle Eastern, Sephardic, and Ashkenazi—share genomewide genetic markers that distinguish them from other worldwide populations". Geneticist [[Noah Rosenberg]] asserts that although recent DNA studies "do not appear to support" the Khazar hypothesis, they do not "entirely eliminate it either."&lt;ref&gt;Balter, Michael.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3885">'''Thomas Ebendorfer''' (August 10, 1388 – January 12, 1464) was an Austrian historian, professor, and statesman.

Born at [[Haselbach, Upper Austria|Haselbach]], in [[Upper Austria]], he studied at the [[University of Vienna]], where in 1412 he received the degree of [[Master of Arts]]. Until 1427 he was attached to the Faculty of Arts and lectured on [[Aristotle]] and [[Latin]] grammar. After 1419 he was also admitted to the theological faculty as 'cursor biblicus'. In 1427 he was made [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] and in 1428 [[Master of Theology]]; soon after he became dean of the theological faculty, in which body he was a professor until his death.

He was rector of the University of Vienna in 1423, 1429, and 1445; and he was also canon of [[Stephansdom|St. Stephen's church]], and engaged in the apostolic ministry as preacher and as pastor of [[Perchtoldsdorf]] and of [[Falkenstein, Lower Austria|Falkenstein]] near Vienna.

He ranks high among the professors of the University of Vienna in the Fifteenth century. In the struggles which it had to sustain, he championed the rights and interests of the university with zeal and energy.

He represented the university at the [[Council of Basle]] (1432–1434), took an active part in all its discussions, and was one of the delegates sent by the council to [[Prague]] to confer with the [[Hussites]].

From 1440 to 1444 he was sent to various cities as ambassador of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]]. He disapproved of the attitude of the [[Council of Basle]] towards both pope and emperor, and eventually withdrew from it.

His advocacy of the rights of the Vienna University, coupled with the attacks of his opponents, lost him the favour of the emperor, who saw in him a secret enemy.

In 1451 and 1452 he was in [[Italy]] and went to [[Rome]] where he obtained from the pope a confirmation of the privileges of the University of Vienna.

In the war between Frederick III and [[Albert of Brandenburg]] he tried to act as mediator but only fell into greater disfavour with Frederick.

His last years were clouded by the disturbances of the years 1461–1463 during which Austria had much to suffer from the [[King of Bohemia]], [[George of Podebrady]], and from internal conflicts.

==Historical and Religious Works==
Ebendorfer is one of the most prominent chroniclers of the Fifteenth century. His "Chronicon Austriae" is a dull but frank and very detailed history of [[Austria]] to 1463. From 1400 on it is an indispensable source of Austrian history (ed. Pez in "Scriptores rerum Austriacarum", II, [[Leipzig]], 1725, 689-986; in this edition all of Book I and part of Book II were omitted).

His account of the [[Council of Basle]] appears in the "Diarium gestorum concilii Basileensis pro reductione Bohemorum" (ed. Birk in Monumenta concilii Basileensis, Scriptores, I, Vienna, 1875, 701-783).

He wrote also a history of the [[Roman emperor]]s, "Chronica regum Romanorum"; Books VI and VII, which are of independent value as sources, were edited by Pribram in the ''[[Mitteilungen des Instituts für österreichische Geschichtsforschung]]'', third supplementary volume ([[Innsbruck]], 1890-1894), 38-222.

Many of his writings are as yet unedited, among them commentaries on Biblical books, sermons, "Liber de schismatibus", "Liber Pontificum Romanorum" (see Levinson, "Thomas Ebendorfers Liber Pontificum" in "Mitteilungen des Instituts fur osterreichische Geschichtsforschung", XX, 1899, 69-99). 'Sermones Dominicales', printed in Strasbourg in 1478.

'''Timofey Nikolayevich Granovsky''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Тимофей Николаевич Грановский}}; 9 March 1813 – 4 October 1855) was a founder of [[mediaeval studies]] in the [[Russian Empire]].

Granovsky was born in [[Oryol]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adm.orel.ru/index.php?head=2&amp;part=3&amp;unit=52&amp;in=6 |title=Oryol |accessdate=2009-10-15 |publisher=Government of Oryol Oblast' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315201200/http://www.adm.orel.ru/index.php?head=2 |archivedate=2010-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the universities of Moscow and Berlin, where he was profoundly influenced by [[Hegel]]ian ideas of [[Leopold von Ranke]] and [[Friedrich Karl von Savigny]]. He felt that the Western history was superior to that of his own country and became the first Russian to deliver courses on the medieval history of Western Europe (1839). Due to the strict censorship of the period, Granovsky assumed that lecturing provided a surer way of disseminating Western ideals in Russia than writing. His major printed work was his doctoral dissertation of 1849, ''Abbat Sugerii'' ([[Abbot Suger]]), in which he "portrayed the great abbot as the architect of royal centralization."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Alan Cole, "Timofei Nikolaevich Granovsky," ''Russian Literature in the Age of Pushkin and Gogol: Prose'' (Gale Research, 1999; {{ISBN|0787618535}}), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; His master's thesis of 1845, "Volin, Yumsberg, i Vineta" ([[Wolin (town)|Wolin]], [[Jomsborg]], and [[Vineta]]), attempted to disprove the historicity of Vineta and was very controversial, offending the [[Slavophiles]].

His readings in the [[Moscow University]] were immensely popular and brought him in touch with other Westernizers. One of these, [[Alexander Herzen]], described Granovsky's lectures as "a draught of freedom in [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]'s Russia".

[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novel ''[[The Possessed (novel)|The Possessed]]'' features a character, Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky, that is partly based on Granovsky. According to Cole, this "liberal who unwittingly inspired a generation of nihilists is unfair to Granovsky but is nevertheless another tribute to his importance as an inspiring teacher and a man of his age."&lt;ref&gt;Cole, "Timofei Nikolaevich Granovsky," p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Montecatini Alto.jpg|thumb|left|Montecatini; where Ferretti lived most of his life, and where he currently lives with his wife.]]
Vasco Ferretti was born in [[Buggiano]], [[Toscana]] (August 25, 1935). He was born in to a farming family, and obtained his master's degree in 1953, after studying for two years at the Catering College of [[Montecatini Terme|Montecatini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferretti|first1=Vasco|title=Kesselring|date=2009|publisher=Ugo Mursia Editore|location=Milano|url=http://www.ibs.it/code/9788842538189/ferretti-vasco/kesselring.html|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked as a hotel doorman in [[Forte dei Marmi]].
In 1955–1956 he attended the annual course for trade union leaders of the Trade Union [[Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions|CISL]] (Centro Studi di San Domenico di [[Fiesole]]),
and emerged with a five-year assignment in [[Rome]] as the National Secretary of Tourism Workers in the same [[Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions|CISL]].
He returned to Montecatini because of his family's economic problems and then studied to obtain a degree in [[philosophy]] and [[science of education]] in 1970 at the [[University of Urbino]], where he subsequently taught for two years.
His victory at the Ministerial Competition allowed him to teach [[philosophy]] and [[history]] at the Institute of [[Pescia]] and [[Montecatini Terme|Montecatini]], until his retirement from teaching in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuoco fatuo Il lato effimero dell amore|url=http://www.italybook.net/scaricare/fuoco-fatuo-il-lato-effimero-dell-amore-italian-edition|website=Italy Book|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1975 he was listed in the Register of Journalists working in [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vasco Ferretti|url=http://www.giovaneholden.it/autori-a-z/autori-f/category/741-vasco-ferretti|website=Giovane Holden Edizioni|publisher=Giovane Holden Edizioni|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For the past decades he has dedicated himself to [[historical research]] by publishing with Mursia (Milan) the following works:
"Kesselring" (biography); "Nazi massacres of Marzabotto, Stazzema and marshes of Fucecchio."; "1944, a Red Blood Summer", set in Tuscany under the German occupation during [[World War II]].
Ferretti also works with other publishers: "Lager and Gulag" with Amazon (ebook on Kindle).

==Influences==
Ferretti's works are highly influenced by traces of his philosophical and classical formation. In passages of his books there are multiple references to [[Franz Kafka]] in the syntax and in the paragraph structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vasco Ferretti|url=http://www.vascoferretti.it/|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His works are influenced by his association with [[Hermeticism]] and by his relationship with writers such as  [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]], [[Salvatore Quasimodo]], [[Eugenio Montale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hermeticism|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Hermeticism|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dante Alighieri]], who deeply influenced him and his literature. Hermeticism is a tradition which follows a set of philosophical and religious beliefs.

===Kesselring (2009)===

''Kesselring'' (Edizioni Mursia, Milano, 2009) is a [[biography]] of [[Albert Kesselring]], a German [[Luftwaffe]] general, during [[World War II]]. The general was born on November 30, 1885, in Marktsteft (German empire) and died in a [[sanatorium]] in [[Bad Nauheim]] in West Germany, on 16 July 1960 at the age of 74, following a [[heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;von Lingen, ''Soldat bis zum letzten Tag? Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring'', p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the most skillful and highly decorated commanders of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kesselring|url=http://www.vascoferretti.it/storiacontemporanea/kess-erling|website=Sezione Storia Contemporanea|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biography focuses on the general's military feats, his imprisonment and his participation to the [[Nuremberg trials]](1946)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Focardi|first1=Filippo|title=La questione dei processi ai criminali di guerra tedeschi in Italia: fra punizione frenata, insabbiamento di Stato, giustizia tardiva (1943-2005) Indice dell'articolo|journal=Annali dell'Istituto La Malfa|date=March 2006|url=http://storicamente.org/focardi_shoa}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a witness, and to the trials in [[Venice]] (1947) as an accused. The structure of the biography is a historical-judiciary thriller, which is one of the characteristics that made this novel one of Vasco Ferretti's most relevant works.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mursia.com/index.php/it/storia/kesselring-detail&lt;/ref&gt; Author ''Ovidio Dallera'' in a review of ''Kesselring'' describes General [[Albert Kesselring|Kesselring]] as a character who earned his notoriety unlike many historical characters who have obtained an undeserved 'fame'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Innocenti|first1=Marco|title=Libri / Kesselring|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Tempo%20libero%20e%20Cultura/2009/03/kesselring-libro.shtml?uuid=dd045fe4-10c1-11de-b369-ca847b73950d&amp;DocRulesView=Libero&amp;refresh_ce=1|accessdate=23 November 2016|publisher=Il Sole 24 Ore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasco Ferretti, has been the first historical researcher that has brought the acts of the process against [[Albert Kesselring]] in [[Italy]], from the War Office in [[Kew]] ([[London]]), from which he also drew the book Vernichten.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mursia.com/index.php/it/storia/storia-contemporanea/seconda-guerra-mondiale/nazismo/kesselring-detail&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kesselring'' by Vasco Ferretti isn't the only book regarding the general, since other writings about him could also be found, for example: [[Kesselring]]'s own biography written by himself during his combat years,  ''Albert Kesselring'' written by '''P. Paolo Battistelli''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Kesselring|url=https://ospreypublishing.com/albert-kesselring|website=Osprey Publishing|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Kesselring: the making of the Luftwaffe'' written by [[Kenneth Macksey]].

===Dante Alighieri e la battaglia di Montecatini (2015)===

''Dante Alighieri e la battaglia di Montecatini'' (EDIFIR, 2015) is a [[historical novel]] about the [[Battle of Montecatini]], on August 29, 1325 in the [[Province of Pistoia]].
The battle was fought in the [[Val di Nievole]] by the [[Republic of Pisa]], and the forces of both the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Republic of Florence]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The [[Guelphs]] and the '''[[Capetian dynasty|Capetian]] House of Anjou''' hoped the battle represented the showdown for the [[Ghibellines]] of [[Pisa]] and of [[Lucca]], led by [[Uguccione della Faggiuola]] and [[Castruccio Castracani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meek|first1=Christine E.|title=DELLA FAGGIUOLA, Uguccione|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/uguccione-della-faggiuola_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|website=Treccani|publisher=treccani.it|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it turned out to be a tragic defeat to the detriment of [[Florence]] instead. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], in his biography of Castruccio Castracani,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Antelminelli|first1=Coreglia|title=Vita di Castruccio Castracani: tiranno magnanimo e crudele|url=http://www.loschermo.it/46478/|website=loSchermo|publisher=loSchermo|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that the battle only caused thousands of deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battaglia montecatini2 dep|url=https://issuu.com/13460/docs/battaglia_montecatini2_dep|website=issuu|publisher=Comune di Pisa|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the ransom of many prisoners, Florence suffered an economic collapse and this situation made complex the conditions of [[Dante Alighieri]], who was returning after thirteen years of exile. Dante himself, as well as all his biographers, desired to go back to Florence to spend the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dante Alighieri e la battaglia di Montecatini. 29 agosto 1315|url=http://www.unilibro.it/libro/ferretti-vasco/dante-alighieri-battaglia-montecatini-29-agosto-1315/9788879707657|website=Unilibro|publisher=Edifir|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It unfortunately was a life expectancy never assuaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dante Alighieri e la battaglia di Montecatini. 29 agosto 1315|url=https://www.ibs.it/dante-alighieri-battaglia-di-montecatini-libro-vasco-ferretti/e/9788879707657|website=Internet Bookshop Italia|publisher=EDIFIR|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vernichten (1988)===
Vernichten (in German = 'annihilate') refers to the order given to the soldiers of the [[Wehrmacht]] for the massacre of the Marsh of Fucecchio in August 23–24, 1944.
It was run by General Peter Eduard Crasemann and caused 174 victims (men, women and children).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vascoferretti.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=39&amp;catid=13&amp;Itemid=243&lt;/ref&gt;
The massacre took place in the area between [[Pistoia]] and [[Florence]] that is called Marsh of [[Fucecchio]].
The reasons for the massacre are unclear, but could be related to false intelligence which pointed out the presence of gangs of [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]] in the Marsh of [[Fucecchio]].

===Processo a Moravia (1994)===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MoraviaIT.jpg|120px|thumb|left|Alberto Moravia]] --&gt;
In a late evening of September 1974 (16 years before his death), [[Alberto Moravia]] is the great defendant in a process that takes place in one of the "liberty" rooms of the Tamerici baths in [[Montecatini Terme|Montecatini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Il Liberty a Montecatini Terme|url=http://www.oltrepistoia.it/scoprire-il-territorio/pistoia/borghi-e-paesi/valdinievole/145-il-liberty-a-montecatini-terme.html|website=Oltre Pistoia - Andare oltre per vedere altro|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Processo a Moravia|url=http://www.vascoferretti.it/criticaletteraria/processo-a-moravia|website=Vasco Ferretti- Autore - Home|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accuser is [[Aldo Rossi]], the defender of Moravia is Geno Pampaloni, a well known Italian book reviewer. It was more a great opportunity for Moravia to express himself, his ideas and his motives to write rather than the focus on the process itself. He explained so much that it could have been possible to draft his autobiography. He was brought to the process because of his lack of proper interest in the country's affairs. He confesses his thoughts in front of an audience that previously had witnessed at the process of [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] and accept his reasons as well as it did with Moravia's in this trial fiction.
Moravia claims he is a disciple of Fëdor Dostoevskij ([[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]): indeed traces of the Russian writer can be recognized in his literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I gusti letterari di Alberto Moravia|url=http://www.letteratura.rai.it/articoli/i-gusti-letterari-di-alberto-moravia/998/default.aspx|website=Rai Cultura Letteratura|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alberto Moravia]] outlines his strong tendency to tell stories and his great curiosity as to illustrate his disengaged literature. Geno Pampaloni deems him to be the most illustrious journalist in Italy; nowadays he is still remembered as one of the greatest journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quando il giornalismo in Italia lo faceva Moravia|url=https://www.loccidentale.it/articoli/9642/quando-il-giornalismo-in-italia-lo-faceva-moravia|website=l'Occidentale-Orientamento quotidiano|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zuo Qiuming''', '''Zuoqiu Ming''' or '''Qiu Ming'''{{efn|In surviving sources, it is uncertain whether his [[Chinese name|surname]] was [[Zuo (surname)|Zuo]] or Zuoqiu. An alternate viewpoint is that his name is Qiu Ming; "Zuo" refers to his official post of ''zuoshi'', which has remained in his family for some generations.}} (556 BC-451 BC)&lt;ref&gt; ''Confucius and [[Lao Zhu]] Their Differing Social Foundations and Cultures'' Sino-Platonic Papers 211 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was a Chinese writer and contemporary of [[Confucius]] who lived in the [[Lu (state)|State of Lu]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of ancient China. 

The influential ''[[Zuozhuan]]'' (''Commentary of Zuo'') is traditionally attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rhetoric in ancient China, fifth to third century, B.C.: a comparison with classical Greek rhetoric|author=Xing Lu|publisher=[[University of South Carolina Press]]|year=1998|page=107|isbn=1-57003-216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also possibly a contributor to ''[[Guoyu (book)|Guoyu]]''. One tradition, according to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', holds that he was blind (cf. [[Homer]]).

Zuo is noted in the ''[[Analects]]'' as a paragon of virtue to Confucius.{{efn|{{lang-zh|子曰：「巧言、令色、足恭，左丘明恥之，丘亦恥之。匿怨而友其人，左丘明恥之，丘亦恥之。}} "The Master said, "Fine words, an insinuating appearance, and excessive respect - Zuo Qiuming was ashamed of them. I also am ashamed of them. To conceal resentment against a person, and appear friendly with him - Zuo Qiuming was ashamed of such conduct. I also am ashamed of it."&lt;ref&gt;''Confucian Analects'', translated by [[James Legge]] in Vol. I of ''The Chinese Classics''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
