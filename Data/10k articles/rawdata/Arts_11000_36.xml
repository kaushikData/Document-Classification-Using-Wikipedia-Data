'''(In)visible Dialogues''' was an art project realized at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Stockholm]] in 2011. It was initiated by artist [[Per Huttner]] and biochemist [[Elias Arnér]]. The project was transgressing the boundaries of [[exhibition]], [[publication]] and [[lecture]]s in order to stimulate dialogues between art and science. The project was a sequel to the project [[Begrepp – En samling]] from 1992&lt;ref name="(In)visible Dialogues"&gt;''(In)visible Dialogues'', Ed. E. Arnér and P. Huttner, Published by Dent-de-Leone. {{ISBN|978-91-978934-3-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drew on Hüttner's experiences from projects like [[I am a Curator]]&lt;ref name="Introdictionary"&gt;{{cite book

Languages: English, Swedish, Spanish and Rumanian. Design by Åbäke. Published by Vacio 9 and The Rumanian Cultural Institute. {{ISBN|978-91-633-0548-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

(In)Visible Dialogues was installed in three interconnected rooms. In the first, you saw 120 fluorescent chairs facing a blank wall. On the back of each chair a copy of the project's catalogue had been nailed and officially signed by a Professor from [[Karolinska Institutet]] and approved for publication, following local academic protocol. Each chair was an authorized copy of [[Jonas Bohlin]]'s Concrete from 1980 that had been customized by the design group Åbäke.&lt;ref name="(In)visible Dialogues" /&gt;

The two flanking side rooms remained empty apart from a solitary lectern painted in the same color as the chairs and which was connected to speakers that emitted music and sounds composed for the occasion by participating sound artists [[Andy Cox]] and Richard Allalouf, Natalia Kamia, Samon Takahashi, [[Ebbot Lundberg]] and Yan Jun who interpreted a text written by Hüttner and Arnér on the importance and difficulty of dialogues between art and science.&lt;ref name="(In)visible Dialogues" /&gt; A new sound piece was played back each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.invisibledialogues.org/sounds.php |title=The sound pieces can be heard to on this website |access-date=2012-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726185523/http://www.invisibledialogues.org/sounds.php |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lundberg's contribution, ''There's Only One of Us Here'' was released in 2012 – his first solo album in a 25-year career.

At 2pm, every Sunday in March 2011, a dialogue took place. The dialogues were devised so that a member of the scientific community dialogued with a member of the world of visual art. The audience could not see the two dialoguing people, who could not see each other either.

'''''Aerograd''''' ({{lang-ru|Аэроград}}, also referred to as '''''Air City''''' or '''''Frontier''''') is a 1935 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[adventure film]] by [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] director [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], a coproduction between [[Mosfilm]] and [[Dovzhenko Film Studios|VUFKU]]. It is an adventure story set in the Soviet Far East in the future.

==Plot==
A [[Russia]]n outpost in Eastern [[Siberia]] comes under threat of attack by the [[Japan]]ese in this patriotic film from 1935. Aerograd is a new town with a strategically located airfield of vital interest to the government. Work on the new outpost is complicated when tensions develop between workers and a religious sect. The sect threatens to give their support to a band of marauding [[samurai]] warriors who battle for control of the region. Relations between the two countries are further strained in the days before [[World War II]], dating back to the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905. In this feature, the Russians are victorious as airplanes throughout the country come to the aid of the beleaguered new town. Director Alexander Dovzhenko, long considered a giant in Russian classic cinema, also wrote the screenplay for this feature.

An '''after action report''' (or '''AAR''') is any form of [[retrospective]] analysis on a given sequence of goal-oriented actions previously undertaken, generally by the author themselves.

The two principal forms of AARs are the [[literary]] AAR, intended for recreational use, and the analytical AAR, exercised as part of a process of [[performance evaluation]] and improvement. In most cases, AARs are a combination of both. Most analytical AARs are conducted over a contemporary problem or situation that has occurred in the past, is happening right now, or what could happen in the future.

== History ==
The first AARs were developed by [[army generals]]. One of the first and best examples of an AAR is [[Julius Caesar]]’s “[[Commentaries on the Gallic War]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Rick|title=Feedback toolkit : 16 tools for better communication in the workplace|date=2011|publisher=Productivity Press|location=New York|isbn=1439840938|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x_vgdUxhj5oC&amp;lpg=PT57&amp;dq=%22after%20action%20report%22%20%22Commentaries%20on%20the%20Gallic%20War%22&amp;pg=PT57#v=onepage&amp;q=%22after%20action%20report%22%20%22Commentaries%20on%20the%20Gallic%20War%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary examples of AARs include project evaluations in [[business]], as well as summaries of large gaming sessions in [[videogame]] culture.

== Literary AARS ==
Literary AARs can be formal or informal documents that seek syntax and linguistic improvement. Many [[research papers]] published under an academic journal can be considered a literary AAR. There might not be much of a difference between literary AARs and analytical AARs in terms of research papers, but the key difference is analytical seeks to improve performance while literary seeks to improve style.

== Analytical AARs ==
Analytical AARs are formal [[documents]] intended to serve as aids to performance evaluation and improvement, by registering situation–response interactions, analyzing critical procedures, determining their effectiveness and efficiency, and proposing adjustments and recommendations. 

=== Objectives ===
Analytical AARs have three central objectives:

* Identifying problematic issues and needs for improvement
* Proposing measures to counteract problematic elements
* Obtaining “lessons learned”

=== Structure ===
#Overview
#Goals and objectives
#Analysis of outcomes
#Analysis of the performance shown on critical tasks
#Summary
#Recommendations

=== Examples ===
* The U.S. Army has adopted the After Action Review (AAR) as the primary method for delivering feedback after unit training exercises. Likewise, the U.S. Army Research Institute (ARI) has supported the development and implementation of AAR procedures for over 20 years. The After Action Review Process is critical to forming an After Action Report. Notes from the review often find themselves in the report. &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, J. E., &amp; Meliza, L. L. (1999). Foundations of the after action review process, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another example of an After Action Report is the global status reported on [[road safety]]. Studies are conducted in order to determine how severe road safety concerns are in a particular area. After this, a report is created over the conditional event that is road safety, and a reflection is written with insight into how road safety can be improved.&lt;ref&gt;Disability, W. H. O. D. of V. and I. P. and, Prevention, W. H. O. V. and I., &amp; Organization, W. H. (2009). Global status report on road safety: Time for action. World Health Organization, 1-227.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exercise reports are a form of analytical AARs and could be peer-reviewed by an expert who might make suggestions to one's workout routine. Exercise reports find themselves following the same structure as a general AAR. A draft report can be written before workouts, and a follow-up report could be written afterward detailing steps the user could act upon in order to improve their work ethic. The exerciser looking at their own report would know what they need to improve upon in the future, and could practice that skill in order to perfect it.&lt;ref&gt;Blue, C. L. (1995). The predictive capacity of the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior in exercise research: An integrated literature review. Research in Nursing &amp; Health, 18(2), 105–121. https://doi.org/10.1002/nur.4770180205&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anders Petters stuga''' or '''Anders Petters stuga står i ljusan låga''' is an old [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Christmas music|Christmas song]] of unknown origin. It is often sung when dancing around the [[Christmas tree]]. Alternate lyrics are '''Anders Perssons stuga'''. Lyrical, the song deals with a fire in "Anders Petters'" [[cottage]]. While the lyrics don't mention [[Christmas]], the words "ljusen" are here strongly associated with the [[candle]]s lit at Christmastime.

==Publication==
*[[Julens önskesångbok]], 1997, under the lines "Tjugondag Knut dansar julen ut", credited as "folksong"

==Recordings==
An early recording was done by [[Margareta Schönström]] in May 1925, and the record came out in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smdb.kb.se/catalog/id/002055386|title=Jag minns ; Anders Perssons stuga|publisher=Svensk mediedatabas|language=Swedish|date=1925|accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Approaching Thunder Storm''''' is an 1859 painting by American painter [[Martin Johnson Heade]]. Done in oil on canvas, the work depicts an approaching thunderstorm. It was his largest painting to date.&lt;ref&gt;Strazdes, 164&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11050|title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is praised for its dramatic depiction of the threatening mood of blackening skies and eerily illuminated terrain prior to the storm itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of a series of paintings by Heade of coastal landscapes, this work was based on a sketch that Heade made of an approaching storm on [[Narragansett Bay]], Rhode Island. Here, a fisherman sits by the shore watching the storm approach; there is a faint red bolt of lightning in the left part of the sky. To his left are a dog, an iron kettle, and a spread-out boat sail. Another fisherman is rowing toward the shore, having left his sailboat out on the bay. His placement in the composition helps provide a sense of distance and a narrative for the scene. 

The painting is fairly conventional for its time, but the scene is hardly [[picturesque]]. Strazdes suggests that "Heade, by refusing to prettify his scenery by association, was attempting to inject into his artistic vision a serious, monumental simplicity it had not previously possessed."&lt;ref name="s165"&gt;Strazdes, 165&lt;/ref&gt; The composition is very open, as if seen through a wide-angle lens, and relatively empty. The swathes of dark color are novel for a landscape work. The long horizon is an influence from Heade's contemporary, [[Frederic Edwin Church]], as in paintings such as ''[[Niagara (Frederic Edwin Church)|Niagara]]''.&lt;ref name="s165"/&gt;

Numerous [[pentimenti]] suggest that Heade altered the composition over time; for example, the hills on the horizon were originally larger and more jagged.  Records suggest that ''Approaching Thunder Storm'' was exhibited at the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1860.&lt;ref name="s165"/&gt; In 1868, Heade painted ''Thunder Storm on Narragansett Bay'', a similar composition.

An '''auxochrome''' (from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|αὐξάνω}} ''auxanō'' "increase" and {{wikt-lang|grc|χρῶμα}} ''chrōma'' "colour") is a group of atoms attached to a [[chromophore]] which modifies the ability of that chromophore to [[Absorption (light)|absorb light]]. They themselves fail to produce the colour; but when present along with the chromophores in an organic compound intensifies the colour of the [[chromogen]].&lt;ref name="Prince"&gt;{{cite book | title=Principles of Organic Chemistry | publisher=Jai Sai Publications | first=M. | last=Vishwanathan | location=Kollam, Kerala | page=2/30}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[hydroxyl group]] (−OH), the [[amino group]] (−NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[aldehyde]] group (−CHO), and the [[methyl mercaptan]] group (−SCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gronowitz|first=Salo J. O.|journal=Arkiv för Kemi|volume=27|page=239|date=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An auxochrome is a [[functional group]] of atoms with one or more [[lone pair]]s of electrons when attached to a chromophore, alters both the [[wavelength]] and intensity of [[Absorption (light)|absorption]]. If these groups are in direct [[Conjugation (organic chemistry)|conjugation]] with the [[Pi-bond|pi]]-system of the chromophore, they may increase the wavelength at which the light is absorbed and as a result intensify the absorption. A feature of these auxochromes is the presence of at least one [[lone pair]] of electrons which can be viewed as extending the conjugated system by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]].

==Effects on chromophore==

It increases the color of any [[organic compound]]. For example, [[benzene]] does not display color as it does not have a chromophore; but [[nitrobenzene]] is pale yellow color because of the presence of a [[nitro group]] (−NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which acts as a chromophore. But [[p-Nitrophenol|''p''-hydroxynitrobenzene]] exhibits a deep yellow color, in which the [[hydroxyl|−OH]] group acts as an auxochrome. Here the auxochrome (−OH) is conjugated with the chromophore −NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Similar behavior is seen in [[azobenzene]] which has a red color, but [[p-Hydroxyazobenzene|''p''-hydroxyazobenzene]] is dark red in color.

The presence of an auxochrome in the [[chromogen]] molecule is essential to make a [[dye]]. However, if an auxochrome is present in the meta position to the chromophore, it does not affect the color.

An auxochrome is known as a compound that produces a [[bathochromic shift]], also known as red shift because it increases the wavelength of absorption, therefore moving closer to [[infrared light]]. [[Woodward's rules|Woodward−Fieser rules]] estimate the shift in wavelength of maximum absorption for several auxochromes attached to a [[conjugated system]] in an organic molecule.

An auxochrome helps a dye to bind to the object that is to be colored.  [[Electrolytic dissociation]] of the auxochrome group helps in binding and it is due to this reason a [[base (chemistry)|basic]] substance takes an [[acid]]ic dye.

==Explanation for the colour modification==
A molecule exhibits colour because it absorbs colours only of certain frequencies and reflects or transmits others. They are capable of absorbing and emitting light of various frequencies. Light waves with frequency very close to their [[natural frequency]] are absorbed readily. This phenomenon, known as [[resonance]], means that the molecule can absorb radiation of a particular frequency which is same as the frequency of electron movement within the molecule. The chromophore is the part of the molecule where the energy difference between two different [[molecular orbitals]] falls within the range of the [[visible spectrum]] and hence absorbs some particular colours from visible light. Hence the molecule appears coloured. When auxochromes are attached to the molecule, the natural frequency of the chromophore gets changed and thus the colour gets modified. Different auxochromes produce different effects in the chromophore which in turn causes absorption of light from other parts of the spectrum. Normally, auxochromes which intensify the colour are chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Dye Spectrum | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TaGZ6a_ZXEcC&amp;pg=PA52-IA2&amp;dq=Chromophore+intitle:New+intitle:Scientist&amp;hl=ml#v=onepage&amp;q=Chromophore&amp;intitle%3ANew&amp;intitle%3AScientist&amp;f=false | journal=New Scientist |date=May 1989 | volume=122 | issue=1665 | pages=52 | ISSN=0262-4079 | publisher=Reed Business Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

There are mainly two types of auxochromes:

* [[Acid]]ic: [[Carboxyl|−COOH]], [[Hydroxyl|−OH]], [[Sulfonate|−SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H]]
* [[Base (chemistry)|Basic]]: [[Amino group|−NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Secondary amine|−NHR]], [[Tertiary amine|−NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

'''Belgrade Design Week''' is an international festival established in 2005, and held once a year in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. The week-long conference is organized every spring and is the largest design initiative in South Eastern Europe. It covers architecture, design, fashion, publishing, and new media, as well as related fields like communications, marketing, advertising, and arts management.  The event includes design labs, competitions, and presentations from international speakers like [[Karim Rashid]] and [[Daniel Libeskind]].

During the rest of the year, there are related projects such as promoting local designers, holding a branding competition for the Serbian Center for the Promotion of Science, and participating in the Partners of the Human Cities/ Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/projects/|title=Projects|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humancities.eu/story/belgrade-design-week-welcomes-the-city-of-kragujevac-to-the-human-cities-family/|title=Belgrade Design Week welcomes the City of Kragujevac to the Human Cities/ family!|website=humancities.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="belgradedesignweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/interview-with-jovan-jelovac-narativ/|title=INTERVIEW WITH JOVAN JELOVAC – NARATIV|date=1 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also spearheaded the Belgrade 2020 project, promoting the city as a candidate for the [[European Capital of Culture]].&lt;ref name="belgradedesignweek.com"/&gt;

== History ==
First held in 2005, Belgrade Design Week festival was founded by brand consultant [[Jovan Jelovac]], a formally trained architect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.disegnodaily.com/article/belgrade-design-week|title=Belgrade Design Week|website=DisegnoDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The conference costs about half a million euros to produce and is supported mostly through commercial and media sponsorships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Jelovac, education was the primary reason for launching the summit, as well as inspiring the country's citizens through design. In 2014, the president of Serbia, [[Tomislav Nikolić]], presided over the event, mentioning how design can contribute to the country's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgradedesignweek.com/the-ninth-belgrade-design-week-launched/|title=THE NINTH BELGRADE DESIGN WEEK LAUNCHED-DIZAJN PARK MAGAZINE|date=29 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, designer [[Karim Rashid]] was the ambassador for the second Belgrade Design Week and spoke at the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-king-of-kool-is-so-over-new-york/article667234/|title=The King of Kool is so over New York|last=|first=|date=2008-02-02|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-04-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he later headed several design projects in Serbia's capital city.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/on-the-verge-belgrade-europes-latest-urban-success-story/|title=On the Verge {{!}} Belgrade, Europe's Latest Urban Success Story|last=Beaumanis|first=Viia|date=2013-10-11|website=T Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashid stated that he is fascinated by Belgrade and Eastern Europe in general, seeing it "as the next upcoming place - everyone is psyched and enthusiastic about the rebuilding of these poetic, romantic, artistic and very intellectual places."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sajkaca.blogspot.ca/2008/05/karim-rashid-goes-belgrade_18.html|title=Karim Rashid goes Belgrade|website=sajkaca.blogspot.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/five-emerging-fashion-capitals-worth-knowing.html|title=Five Emerging Fashion Capitals Worth Knowing|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/design/moma-yugoslavia-new-exhibition-architecture-concrete-brutalism-celebrate-new-york-photography-a8178471.html|title=New MoMA exhibition celebrates the concrete world of Yugoslavia|date=2018-01-25|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending the design festival in 2008, architect [[Daniel Libeskind]] left with a billion dollar, albeit controversial, commission to redevelop the Belgrade waterfront.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/10/belgrade-waterfront-gulf-petrodollars-exclusive-waterside-development|title=Belgrade Waterfront: an unlikely place for Gulf petrodollars to settle|first=Herbert|last=Wright|date=10 December 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lukabeograd.com/en/city-on-wather/master-plan/strategy.html|title=Luka Beograd :: Strategy|website=www.lukabeograd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major projects like this one are contributing to the renewal of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viaggi.corriere.it/viaggi/weekend/belgrado-hotel-ristoranti/?refresh_ce-cp|title=La nuova Belgrado: cosa vedere, gli hotel e i ristoranti|date=14 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other skyscrapers and shopping malls are in the planning stages, and architectural masterpieces, like the Art Nouveau "Geozavod" building, are being restored.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Belgrade is being compared to 1990's Berlin, seen as a decaying but alive metropolis: "Recently, the gritty city has emerged as an outpost of creative activity and urban cool on the cheap, against the lingering backdrop of socialism."

== About ==
The principal site of the festival changes annually with various run-down or abandoned buildings being renovated for the event. Past locations have included a palace, the bombed out hotel Jugoslavija, an abandoned department store,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/design/belgrade-design-week-09-the-location/|title=belgrade design week 09  the location|date=31 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the closed contemporary art museum, and an old factory.&lt;ref name="designboom.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/design/belgrade-design-week-2014-conferences-brand-new-world-10-05-2014/|title=belgrade design week 2014 conferences open up a brand new world|date=5 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every year, the conference also focuses on a common thread, for example, in 2013 the unifying theme was the square shape.&lt;ref name="glassrpske"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glassrpske.com/plus/intervju/Jovan-Jelovac-Dizajn-nije-umetnost-nego-biznis/lat/110507.html|website=glassrpske.com|title=Jovan Jelovac: Dizajn nije umetnost nego biznis|accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately thirty international speakers present each year and cover a wide range of subjects, helping to promote cultural exchanges between Serbia and the rest of the world. Notable designers and artists who have spoken at the event include [[Konstantin Grcic]], [[Aylin Langreuter]], [[Christophe de la Fontaine]], [[Hella Jongerius]], [[Daan Roosegaarde]], [[Ross Lovegrove]]. [[Christophe Pillet]], [[Sacha Lakic]] and [[Patricia Urquiola]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to the presentations, there are numerous workshops and design competitions, as well as exhibits from designers such as Israeli Eilon Armon and Swiss architect duo Lang/Baumann.&lt;ref name="designboom.com"/&gt;

'''Blackwell UK''', also known as '''Blackwell's''' and '''Blackwell Group''', is a British [[Academic publishing|academic]] [[bookselling|book]] retailer and library supply service. It was founded in 1879 by [[Benjamin Henry Blackwell]],&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; after whom the chain is named, in [[Oxford]] on [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]]. The firm now has a chain of 45 shops, and an accounts and library supply service. It employs around 1000 staff in its divisions.&lt;ref name="Staff ownership"&gt;{{cite news|last=Finch|first=Julia|title=Blackwell book chain owner plans to hand firm over to staff|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/08/blackwells-bookstores-staff-ownership-switch|accessdate=27 January 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="library jobs cut"&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Lisa|title=Blackwell cuts 19 from library supply business|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/blackwell-cuts-19-library-supply-business.html|accessdate=27 January 2012|newspaper=The Bookseller|date=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Blackwell's Bookshop and White Horse, Broad Street Oxford, September 1977.jpg|thumb|The main store in Oxford in 1977]]
The company was founded in 1879 by [[Benjamin Henry Blackwell]], son of the first city librarian, who having finished his education at 13, was apprenticed to a local bookseller for a [[£sd|shilling]] a week. His father, Benjamin Harris Blackwell, had been heavily involved in the [[Temperance movement|Temperance Society]]. The society promoted, as well as religion, self-education and also encouraged reading. The society provided separate rooms for non-alcoholic refreshment and silent reading. A religious family, the Blackwells had also become involved with the Temperance Society due to Benjamin's father being [[teetotal]], and as a protest against the government making money from the [[excise duty]] on alcohol.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=48 – 51 Broad Street, Oxford|url=http://www.headington.org.uk/oxon/broad/buildings/north/48,49,50,51.htm|work=Broad Street Oxford|publisher=Headington|accessdate=27 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702063215/http://headington.org.uk/oxon/broad/buildings/north/48%2C49%2C50%2C51.htm|archivedate=2 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flagship shop at 48–51 [[Broad Street, Oxford]], was originally only twelve feet square but quickly grew to incorporate the upstairs, cellar and neighbouring shops. Benjamin Henry Blackwell was well respected in Oxford and was elected the first [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] councillor for Oxford North.

[[Basil Blackwell]], Benjamin Henry's son, became the first Blackwell to go to university; he was awarded a scholarship at [[Oxford University]]'s [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]]. He was expected to join the family firm, however, which he did in 1913, after a spell as an apprentice publisher in London. He was tasked with expanding his father's publishing business. 
[[File:Norrington room.jpg|thumb|left|The "Norrington Room", contains more than 160,000 books on 3+ miles of shelving]]
The first Blackwell publication, ''Mensæ Secundæ: verses written in [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]]'' by [[H.C. Beeching]], was printed in 1897. Blackwell's began the careers of many writers: [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s first poem, "Goblin's Feet", was published in 1915.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; To promote universal access to literature, Blackwell's pioneered a series of cheaper books, from a one-volume [[Shakespeare]] to "[[£sd|3-and-6]] novels". The publishing company was merged into the main company in 1921, and a scientific section was added in 1939.

When Benjamin Henry died in 1924, Basil Blackwell took over from his father, and went on to head the company for over sixty years. Basil Blackwell also wanted to preserve fine printing. After rescuing the Shakespeare Head Press, he commissioned [[belles-lettres]], including well-known classics such as the [[Pilgrim's Progress]], the works of the [[Brontë]]s and a complete version of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]].

In 1966, the Norrington Room was opened, named after [[Arthur Lionel Pugh Norrington|Sir Arthur Norrington]], the President of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]] and extending under part of Trinity College. It boasts three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) of shelving and at {{convert|10000|sqft|m2}} merited an entry in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the largest single room selling books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Guinness Book of Records|year=1967|publisher=Guinness Superlatives Limited|location=London|isbn=0-900424-00-1|page=123|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
The company has followed a determined policy since the 1990s to spread out from its traditional Oxford base and take on a much broader UK presence.

In 1995, Blackwell's became the first bookshop in the UK to allow its customers to purchase online from a catalogue of over 150,000 titles, and opened a flagship shop in London the same year, at 100 [[Charing Cross Road]], which is now one of the company's six most prominent shops.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Blackwell's took over the Heffers bookshops in [[Cambridge]] in 1999, and in 2002 acquired the academic bookshops of [[James Thin]] in Scotland.

Blackwell's now has over 60 retail outlets across the UK, including a number of medical and other specialist bookshops, and even a shop in [[Aberdeen]] specialising in the [[oil industry]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Both the Oxford and London flagship shops have won Bookseller of the Year at the [[British Book Awards]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The company is still in the hands of the Blackwell family. Support for its activities, including Blackwell's Online, is based at Beaver House in Oxford.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The company was to be partially funded by Toby Blackwell Limited in 2012.&lt;ref name="Blackwell results 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Lisa|title=Revenue drops but losses down at Blackwell|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/revenue-drops-losses-down-blackwell.html|accessdate=16 April 2012|newspaper=The Bookseller|date=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
Blackwell's maintains over 40 retail outlets across the UK, with flagship stores located in [[Oxford]], [[Cambridge]], [[South Bridge, Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] and [[High Holborn|London]]. Other branches are located on university campuses or are specialist branches, focusing on Music and Art.

'''Borscht Belt''', or '''Jewish Alps''', is a nickname for the (now mostly defunct) summer resorts of the [[Catskill Mountains]] in parts of [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]], and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties in [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[Borscht]], a soup associated with immigrants from eastern Europe, was a colloquialism for "Jewish". These resorts were a popular vacation spot for [[New York City]] [[Jews]] between the 1920s and the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/1995-96/95-062i.html |title=Catskills Institute: Jewish scholars study history, cultural significance of the Borscht Belt | publisher= [[Brown University]]| location=Providence, Rhode Island| date=November 29, 1995|accessdate= August 21, 2017| archivedate= August 20, 2017|

Most Borscht Belt resorts hosted traveling Jewish comedians and musicians, and many who later became famous began their careers there.

The tradition of Borscht Belt entertainment started in the early twentieth century with the indoor and outdoor theaters constructed on a 40-acre (16-hectare) tract in [[Hunter, New York|Hunter]], New York, by [[Yiddish theater]] star [[Boris Thomashefsky]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2017/08/21/545027326/jerry-lewis-on-his-borscht-belt-childhood-and-the-lonely-work-of-comedy&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1987 films ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' and ''[[Maureen Stapleton#Filmography|Sweet Lorraine]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/NEWS/80518002|title=Overnight fire destroys Heiden Hotel of 'Sweet Lorraine' fame|work=[[Times Herald-Record]]|location=Middletown, New York|publisher=Dow Jones Local Media Group, Inc.|date=May 18, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2010|archivedate=February 1, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130201165544/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/NEWS/80518002|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflect on the bygone era.

Beginning in the 1980s, the growth of air travel made the Catskills less attractive, so many of the resorts eventually closed, although Jewish culture has remained present. A large percentage of the region comprises summer homes and bungalow colonies (including many of the historic colonies) for [[Orthodox Jewish]] families,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Frankfurter|first=Yitzchok|title=Ruins of the Borscht Belt|url=https://issuu.com/amimagazine/docs/epub_ami136|magazine=[[Ami (magazine)|Ami]]|date=Sep 15, 2013|issue=136|page=172|access-date=Nov 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily from the [[New York metropolitan area]], as well as year-round dwellers.

Resorts still are operating in the region, including Villa Roma, an Italian American resort, [[Soyuzivka]] and Xenia, Ukrainian cultural resorts, and the Skazka and Hotel Pine, Russian cultural resorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skazka.us|website=Skazka.us|title=Skazka Resort|date=|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xeniaresort.net|title=Xenia Resort|website= XeniaResort.net|date=|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianresort.net|title=Hotel Pine|website=RussianResort.net|date=|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, motorsports enthusiasts are drawn to the area visiting the [[Monticello Motor Club]].

==History==
Borscht Belt hotels, bungalow colonies, [[summer camp]]s, and קאָך-אַליינס ''kokh-aleyns'' (a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] name for self-catered [[boarding house]]s, literally, "cook-alones") were frequented by families of middle and working class Jewish New Yorkers, mostly [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish immigrants.
[[Antisemitism]], particularly in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s, meant that they were often denied accommodation elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;E. Raab and G.J. Selznick: Major Social Problems. Joanna Cotler Books, 1974 (3rd edition). {{ISBN|0060452994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Catskill hotels were converted from farms that immigrant Jews had started in the early 1900s. As the area grew, it began to cater specifically to Jews, providing kosher food, synagogues, and other features of Jewish communities, including entertainment. The area became known as "The Jewish Alps", and the [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan County]] portion as "Solomon County".&lt;ref name="hvmag"&gt;{{cite web | last=Levine | first=David | date=August 8, 2014 | title=History of Borscht Belt Hotels and Bungalow Colonies in the Catskills | url=http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/August-2014/History-of-Borscht-Belt-Hotels-and-Bungalow-Colonies-in-the-Catskills/ | work=[[Hudson Valley (magazine)|Hudson Valley]] | publisher=Today Media | accessdate=May 26, 2017 | archivedate=2016-09-18 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918130642/http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/August-2014/History-of-Borscht-Belt-Hotels-and-Bungalow-Colonies-in-the-Catskills/# | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millions of tourists, especially New Yorkers, came to swim in the lakes and oversized hotel pools, to ski or ice-skate&lt;ref name="Tablet Mag" /&gt; or take lessons in golf, tennis, and dancing. No fewer than 538 hotels sprang up in this area of Eastern New York.&lt;ref name="Tablet Mag"/&gt;

The Overlook had entertainment and summer lodging through the late 1960s and was operated by the Schrier family. It included a main building and about 50 other bungalows, plus a five-unit cottage just across the street. It remains in a different form, no longer functioning as it was in its heyday.

The [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway|New York, Ontario &amp; Western Railway]] carried passengers to the resorts from [[Weehawken, New Jersey]], until 1948. The railroad was abandoned in 1957. Despite the improvement of roads such as the original [[New York State Route 17]], the area is no longer a major travel destination.

The decline of the Catskills resorts was apparent as early as 1965. Entertainment in America was changing as the country ushered in the [[jet age]].&lt;ref name="Tablet Mag" /&gt; As ethnic barriers in the U.S. began to fall and travel to distant resorts became easier and cheaper, fewer Jewish American families in New York City went to the Catskills. By the early 1960s, between a quarter and a third of Grossinger's annual visitors were non-Jewish.&lt;ref name=AJones&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Abigail|title=Beautiful ruins: The Catskills may be dying, but the memories live on|url=http://forward.com/articles/183901/rediscovering-beauty-amid-ruins-of-once-glorious-c/?p=all|accessdate=October 27, 2013|work=The Forward|publisher=The Forward Association| date=September 27, 2013|archivedate= March 6, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111031/http://forward.com/culture/183901/rediscovering-beauty-amid-ruins-of-once-glorious-c/?p=all|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the universalization of [[air conditioning|air-conditioned]] hotels across America drew customers away from the aging resorts primarily built before this innovation became popular.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun mistake" /&gt; In the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|social and cultural upheavals of the 1960s]], traditional resort vacations lost their appeal for many younger adults.&lt;ref name=AJones /&gt;

Smaller, more modest hotels such as Youngs Gap and the Ambassador found themselves in a niche with a vanishing clientele and closed by the end of the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} By the mid-1990s, nearly 300 hotels and motels had gone out of business in Sullivan County.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun mistake" /&gt;

The 1970s took a toll on more lavish establishments such as the Flagler and The Laurels.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5it7KmNphMo&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Grossinger's closed for renovations, and the property was abandoned by new owners midway through work. Grossinger's largest historic rival (and the largest of all the Borscht Belt resorts), the Concord, benefitted only temporarily, filing for bankruptcy in 1997 and closing a year later.

In 1987, New York's mayor [[Ed Koch]] proposed buying the Gibber Hotel in Kiamesha Lake to house the homeless. The idea was opposed by local officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Joyce Purnick | first=Joyce | last=Purnick | date=April 4, 1987 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/04/nyregion/catskills-hotel-suggested-for-homeless.html | work=The New York Times | title=Catskills Hotel Suggested For Homeless | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel instead became a religious school, like many old hotels in the Catskills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catskills.brown.edu/hotelframes.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228045158/http://catskills.brown.edu/hotelframes.html |date=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans are now in place by those who purchased the former Borscht Belt resorts [[Concord Resort Hotel]] and [[Grossinger's]] to work with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in an attempt to bring gambling to the region. Because the Borscht Belt's prime has long passed and many of the resorts are abandoned, developers believe this is the only way to revitalize the region to the popularity it once had by attracting guests to world-class casinos and resorts such as the ones in [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} However, large-scale casino plans have not come to fruition, mainly because there are no [[Indian reservation]]s anywhere near the area (the [[Mohawk tribe]]'s effort to build a Catskills casino was rejected for this very reason). Instead, the state government proposed legalizing off-reservation gambling, which required a positive referendum, passed in November 2013.

The '''Bowery Theatre''' was a playhouse on the [[Bowery]] in the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Although it was founded by rich families to compete with the upscale [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]], the Bowery saw its most successful period under the [[populism|populist]], pro-American management of [[Thomas Hamblin]] in the 1830s and 1840s. By the 1850s, the theatre came to cater to immigrant groups such as the [[Irish American|Irish]], [[German American|Germans]], and [[Chinese American|Chinese]]. It burned down four times in 17 years, a fire in 1929 destroying it for good. Although the theatre's name changed several times (Thalia Theatre, Fay's Bowery Theatre, etc.), it was generally referred to as the "Bowery Theatre".

==Founding and early management==
[[File:New York Theatre, The Bowery, New York City.jpg|thumb|left|1826 New York Theatre, by architect Ithiel Town]]
By the mid-1820s, wealthy settler families in the new ward that was made fashionable by the opening of [[Lafayette Street]], parallel to the Bowery, wanted easy access to fashionable high-class European drama, then only available at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]]. Under the leadership of Henry Astor, they formed the New York Association and bought the land where Astor's [[Bull's Head Tavern]] stood,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theboweryboys.blogspot.com/2009/03/bulls-head-tavern-hey-astor-wheres-beef.html The Bowery Boys: "Bull's Head Tavern"]; the old tavern was moved into the countryside, on the northwest corner of 3rd Avenue and 24th Street, where the new cattle market developed around it.&lt;/ref&gt; facing the neighborhood and occupying the area between Elizabeth, [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal]] (then called Walker), and Bayard streets.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; They hired architect [[Ithiel Town]] to design the new venue.

Some notable investors included Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, son-in-law to President [[James Monroe]], and [[James Alexander Hamilton]], son of [[Alexander Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= As I remember: recollections of American society during the nineteenth century |author= Marian Campbell Gouverneur |publisher= D. Appleton and Company |year= 1911 |page= 257 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4wklAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new playhouse, with its [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] design,&lt;ref name=Tooker1/&gt; was more opulent than the Park, and it seated 3,500 people, making it the biggest theatre in the United States at the time.&lt;ref name="Wilmeth and Tice 42"&gt;Wilmeth and Tice 42.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frances Trollope]] compared it to the Park Theatre as "superior in beauty; it is indeed as pretty a theatre as I ever entered, perfect as to size and proportion, elegantly decorated, and the scenery and machinery equal to any in London...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Frances Trollope|Trollope, Fanny]] (1832). ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowery Theatre opened on 22 October 1826 under the name '''New York Theatre''', with the comedy [https://books.google.com/books?id=sYITAAAAQAAJ ''The Road to Ruin,''] by [[Thomas Holcroft]], under the management of Charles A. Gilfert. New York Mayor [[Philip Hone]] spoke at the opening ceremony, imploring the theatre's intended upper-class audience: "It is therefore incumbent upon those whose standing in society enables them to control the opinions and direct the judgment of others, to encourage, by their countenance and support, a well-regulated theatre."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Cockrell, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first few seasons were devoted to [[ballet]], [[opera]], and high drama. The theatre was by this time quite fashionable, and the northward expansion of [[Manhattan]] gave the theatre access to a large patronage.  The theatre burnt out in 1828, but was rebuilt behind the same facade - by the architect Joseph Sera - and reopened under the name '''Bowery Theatre'''.&lt;ref name=Tooker2/&gt; Gilfert's understanding of [[advertising]] was keen, but in 1829 the owners fired him.

==Hamblin's tenure==
[[File:Bowery Theatre New York, by George Melksham Bourne.jpg|thumb|left|Bowery Theatre of 1828, from ''Bourne  Views  of  New  York'' (1830-31)]]
The owners hired [[Thomas Hamblin]] and [[James H. Hackett]] in August 1830 to manage the theatre. A month later, Hackett left Hamblin in complete control. After the Bowery burned down later that year, Hamblin rebuilt. He then took the theatre in a decidedly different direction for what would be its most innovative and successful period.
[[Image:Bowery-Theatre-Leslie-1856.jpeg|thumb|right|Bowery Theatre of 1845, shown in 1856]]
American theatres stratified in the [[Jacksonian Era]], and the Bowery emerged as the home of [[Nativism (politics)|American nativists]] and [[populism|populist]] causes, placing it in direct contrast to the Park Theatre's cultivated image of traditional European high culture. This was partially the result of an anti-British theatre riot at the Park; Hamblin renamed the playhouse "the '''American Theatre, Bowery'''" in reaction. Hamblin hired unknown [[United States|American]] actors and playwrights and allowed them to play for long runs of up to a month. Before 1843, early [[blackface]] performers such as [[George Washington Dixon]] and [[Thomas D. Rice]] played there frequently, and acts such as [[J. B. Booth]], [[Edwin Forrest]], [[Louisa Lane Drew]], and [[Frank Chanfrau]] also gained renown on the Bowery's stage. [[George L. Fox (clown)|George L. Fox]] and his [[pantomime]] became the most popular act at the Bowery until after the Civil War. Bowery productions also debuted or popularized a number of new character types, including the [[B'hoy and g'hal|Bowery B'hoy]], the [[Yankee]], the [[Frontiersman]], and the blackface Negro.

The pro-Americanism of the Bowery's audience came to a head during the [[Farren Riots]] of 1834. Farren,&lt;ref&gt;Cockrell calls this individual George P. Farren. Wilmeth and Bigsby in ''The Cambridge History of American Theatre: Beginnings to 1870'' call him [[William Farren]].&lt;/ref&gt; the Bowery's British-born [[stage manager]], had reportedly made anti-American comments and fired an American actor. Protesters reacted by attacking the homes, businesses, and churches of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and blacks in New York City and then storming the theatre on 9 July. Farren apologized for his comments, and George Washington Dixon sang popular songs to quell the rioters.

Hamblin defied conventions of theatre as high culture by booking productions that appealed to [[working class|working-class]] patrons and by advertising them extensively according to Gilfert's model. Animal acts, blackface [[minstrel show]]s, and [[melodrama]] enjoyed the most frequent billings, and hybrid forms, such as melodramas about dogs saving their human masters, became unprecedented successes. Spectacular productions with advanced [[visual effects]], including water and fire, featured prominently. Hamblin also innovated by using [[gas lighting]] in lieu of candles and kerosene lamps. The Bowery Theatre earned the nickname "The Slaughterhouse" for its low-class offerings, and terms like "Bowery melodrama" and "Bowery actors" were coined to characterize the new type of theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols 900.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1834, Hamblin began buying shares in the theatre from the New York Association; he had enough to control the enterprise completely within 18 months. By the time the Bowery burned again in September 1836, it was the most popular playhouse in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;Bank 116.&lt;/ref&gt; despite steep increases in competition (the [[Bowery Amphitheatre]] was right across the street). Visual spectacle had become such an integral part of its appeal that Hamblin claimed $5,000 in wardrobe losses from the fire.&lt;ref&gt;Bank 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamblin bought out the remaining shares in the theatre and rented the site to W. E. Dinneford and [[Thomas Flynn (actor)|Thomas Flynn]], who rebuilt. When this interim Bowery burned down in February 1838, Hamblin replaced it with a bigger and more opulent structure, which opened in May 1839.

Through Hamblin's actions, working-class theatre emerged as a form in its own right, and melodrama became the most popular form of American theatre. Low-class patrons such as [[B'hoy and g'hal|Bowery b'hoys and g'hals]] predominated in the audience. ''[[The Spirit of the Times]]'' described the Bowery's patrons:
[[Image:Bowery-Thalia Theatre.jpg|thumb|Thalia Theatre, which was destroyed in 1929]]
[[File:NYC block including Atlantic Garden and Thalia Theatre, 1905.jpg|thumb|1905 map of the block between Elizabeth (west) &amp; Bowery (east), Bayard (south) and Canal (north), showing the Thalia Theatre just south of large yellow area representing the [[Atlantic Garden]].]]
{{cquote|By reasonable computation there were about 300 persons on the stage and wings alone—soldiers in fatigue dresses—officers with side arms—a few jolly tars, and a number of 'apple-munching urchins.' The scene was indescribably ludicrous. Booth played [Richard III] in his best style, and was really anxious to make a hit, but the confusion incidental to such a crowd on the stage, occasioned constant and most humorous interruptions. It was every thing or any thing, but a tragedy. In the scene with Lady Anne, a scene so much admired for its address, the gallery spectators amused themselves by throwing pennies and silver pieces on the stage, which occasioned an immense scramble among the boys, and they frequently ran between King Richard and Lady Anne, to snatch a stray copper. In the tent scene, so solemn and so impressive, several curious amateurs went up to the table, took up the crown, poised the heavy sword, and examined all the regalia with great care, while Richard was in agony from the terrible dream; and when the scene changed, discovering the ghosts of King Henry, Lady Anne and children, it was difficult to select them from the crowd who thrust their faces and persons among the Royal shadows.

The Battle of Bosworth Field capped the climax—the audience mingled with the soldiers and raced across the stage, to the shouts of the people, the roll of the drums and the bellowing of the trumpets; and when the fight between Richard and Richmond came on, they made a ring round the combattants to see fair play, and kept them at if for nearly a quarter of an hour by "Shrewsberry clock."&lt;ref&gt;Porter, William T. (1 December 1832). ''[[The Spirit of the Times]]''. Quoted in Cockrell 31-2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some sources even suggest that patrons engaged in sexual behavior in the lobbies and boxes.&lt;ref&gt;Mahar 278.&lt;/ref&gt; Understandably, Hamblin was careful to remain in this crowd's good graces. For example, he regularly offered use of the Bowery Theatre for the annual firemen's ball. Only the [[Chatham Garden Theatre]] boasted a rowdier audience.&lt;ref&gt;Trollope, Fanny (1832). ''Domestic Manners of the Americans''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Profits were harder to come by in the 1840s, as more playhouses sprung up in New York. Hamblin staged more effects-driven melodrama and later increased bookings of circus acts, minstrel shows, and other variety entertainments. The Bowery burned down once more in April 1845.&lt;ref name=TRI042645/&gt; This time, Hamblin had [[fire insurance]], and he rebuilt with an eye toward appealing to a more upscale patronage and to staging more spectacular melodrama. The theatre now seated 4,000 and with a stage {{convert|126|ft}} square, secured its place as one of the largest playhouses in the world.&lt;ref name="Wilmeth and Tice 42"/&gt; The architect and builder of the new theatre was [[John M. Trimble]].&lt;ref name=TRI111745/&gt; Hamblin left the management to A. W. Jackson, though Jackson and later managers largely upheld Hamblin's emphasis on melodrama and visual splendor. Hamblin died in January 1853, and the theatre remained in his family until 1867.

Successful plays of Hamblin's tenure included:
*''The Elephant of Siam and the Fire Fiend'' by [[Samuel Beazley]], which featured the elephant [[Mademoiselle D'Jeck]] and ran for 18 consecutive performances in early 1831.&lt;ref name="mz43"/&gt;
*''[[Mazeppa (Byron)|Mazeppa]], Or, The Wild Horse of Ukraine'', which debuted on July 22, 1833 and had 43 consecutive performances, an astounding feat for its time.&lt;ref name="mz43"&gt;Shank, Theodore J. ''Theatre for the Majority: Its Influence on a Nineteenth Century American Theatre'', Educational Theatre Journal, Vol. 11, No. 3 (Oct., 1959), pp. 188-199, at 196 (noting that ''Mazeppa'' had 43 performances; Elephant of Siam and the Water Witch in 1831 had 18 each)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Nick of the Woods]]'', adapted by Louisa Honor de Medina from the popular novel, debuted in February 1838, and reappeared after a theatre fire in May 1839 starring [[Joseph Proctor]].
*''[[Putnam, the Iron Son of '76]]'' by [[Nathaniel Bannister]]. This play debuted on August 5, 1844 and ran for 78 consecutive performances.&lt;ref name="iron1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8qMTPAPFGXUC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Cambridge Guide To Theatre], p. 76 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, Joseph, [https://books.google.com/books?id=C6INAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=417#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Records of the New York stage, from 1750 to 1860], pp. 417, 438&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later management==
By the middle of the 19th century, immigrant groups, notably the [[Irish people|Irish]], began populating the Bowery neighborhood. They came to form a significant portion of the Bowery's audience, mostly in the low-price gallery section. In order to cater to them, the theatre offered plays by James Pilgrim and other Irish playwrights. Meanwhile, the Bowery emerged as the theatrical center for New York's [[Lower East Side]].

Germans Gustav Amberg, [[Heinrich Conried]], and [[Mathilde Cottrelly]] converted the Bowery into the '''Thalia Theatre''' in 1879, offering primarily German theatre during their ownership. In 1891, [[Yiddish theatre]] became the predominant attraction. Italian [[vaudeville]] succeeded this, followed by Chinese vaudeville.

In 1894, [[Maria Roda]] addressed a large rally at the Thalia Theater celebrating [[Emma Goldman]]'s release from prison. Although Roda spoke in Italian and Goldman understood none of it, she was moved by Roda's charismatic presence. She wrote, "Maria's strange beauty and the music of her speech roused the whole assembly to tensest enthusiasm. Maria proved a veritable ray of sunlight to me." She then pledged to become Maria Roda's "teacher, friend, comrade."&lt;ref&gt;Emma Goldman, ''Living My Life: Volume 1'' (Unabridged) (ReadaClassic.com, 2010), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fay's Bowery Theatre" burned down on 5 June 1929 under Chinese management and was never rebuilt.

Tooker owns three prints of the various versions of the Bowery theatre and describes the first as follows: "The first is 'a sketch of the New York Theatre, afterward the Bowery, erected 1826.' It is of a handsome structure, with but two [[Corinthian pillars]], flanked by two square-sided columns, with [[Roman Doric]]s, and are hardly palpable enough as pillars to be so designated. On either side is a plain, flat frontage with two large windows, one above the other, and a small square dead light above these. There is also a low down-stairs pit entrance on each side. The main steps are six in number and lead to a [[portico]] door that appears to be half as high as the theatre. The upper front has a fine, impressive finish, being a [[pediment]] with plain, solid cornices, supported by a row of molding that architects call [[triglyph]]s. There is no Catharine wheel, cinquefoil, or other window in the pediment, and so all that space seems bare. On the north side of the theatre is a two-story, dormer-window, cellar, dwelling house, with peaked roof, of course. The house on the south side is so very small that it looks like a coupon attached to the big building. Well, that is the first, or two-column, old Bowery."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Tooker2&gt;A contemporary engraving suggests alterations may have been made to the facade also. In his reminiscences published in ''The New York Times'' of 1887, Commodore Tooker describes the building as follows: Tooker, Joseph H. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/06/19/104011892.pdf "Booth at the Old Bowery: Commodore Tooker's Recollections,"] ''The New York Times'', June 19, 1887. "The next representation is an engraving taken from Morris &amp; Willis's New-York ''Mirror'' of 1828. (G.P. Morris, Nathaniel P. Willis.) The design was by A. J. Davis and the engraving by Rawdon, Wright &amp; Co., renowned in their day. A fire must have intervened, as this structure has six columns – six Corinthian columns, with Doric capitals. The upper part is a pediment with plain cornices, the support being 11 triglyphs, with a row of as many rings below as further ornamentation. The portico seems to be very spacious and is enclosed by iron railings running in front of the first two columns on either side. There are seven steps leading to the portico and there are four doors. Two pit entrances running below the sidewalk. The main building seems to be of blocks of stone. Mr. Sera was the architect. He was a scenic artist of note in his day. His example was the [[Parthenon|Temple of Minerva]] at Athens. This picture is of singular merit as a specimen of the engraver's art. The clouds hovering above the theatre are superbly drawn and engraved. I value this picture very highly." In his description of an earlier print (see above) Hooker describes the first building as having only two columns.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Paraorchestra''', based in Bristol, is an [[orchestra]] consisting entirely of musicians with [[disability|disabilities]]{{emdash}}the first ever orchestra of its kind in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=telegraph-paraorchestra/&gt; The Paraorchestra was formed by conductor [[Charles Hazlewood]] in 2011 as a project to create a platform for the top disabled musicians, with the hope that its success would lead to better [[Community integration|integration]] of the disabled into music and [[performing arts]]. The orchestra performed its first live show at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] in July 2012 (which was also the subject of a [[Channel 4]] documentary), and received international attention when it played alongside [[Coldplay]] during the [[2012 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in [[London]] in September 2012.

==History==

===Origins===
Charles Hazlewood was inspired by his youngest daughter Eliza to form the Paraorchestra; Eliza has [[cerebral palsy]], but Hazlewood believed that she was still an "outstanding" singer. Being the father of a child with a disability, he realized that throughout his career as an orchestral conductor, he had seen few disabled performers as members of orchestras. Hazlewood felt that since music is "universal", an orchestra should represent all members of a community{{emdash}}comparing this ordeal to the time when only men performed in orchestras. He felt that an orchestra consisting only of disabled performers could spread awareness of this issue and help achieve greater [[Community integration|integration]] for the disabled in music and the performing arts.&lt;ref name=nat-para/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra&gt;{{cite news|title=Coldplay join the paraorchestra of disabled musicians for closing ceremony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/01/orchestra-disabled-people-play-paralympics?newsfeed=true|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 September 2012|location=London|first=Maggie|last=Brown|date=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation===
Hazlewood officially announced the formation of the British Paraorchestra in July 2011 at a [[TED (conference)|TED conference]] in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=nat-para/&gt; He did not intend the Paraorchestra to be a [[Music therapy|therapeutic]] or "warm and fuzzy" project, but rather a platform to showcase disabled musicians with [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] qualities. When holding auditions, he aimed to find musicians who were "at the top of their game, technically, and with a spirit behind the virtuosity." The orchestra's first 17 members come from a variety of backgrounds and use a variety of instruments, including conventional instruments and electronic devices such as [[tablet computer]]s and other assistive technology developed by [[Rolf Gehlhaar]], Professor in Experimental Music at Coventry University and the technical director of the orchestra.&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; After failing to partner with the [[BBC]], Hazlewood successfully commissioned British broadcaster [[Channel 4]] to produce a documentary following the formation of the Paraorchestra and its first performance, which aired on 9 September 2012. He felt airing its documentary on Channel 4 was a "no-brainer", as it was also the official broadcaster of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]].&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; 

The Paraorchestra made its first public appearance on 1 July 2012 during Hazlewood's music festival "Orchestra in a Field" at [[Glastonbury Abbey]]; the performance included its versions of "[[Greensleeves]]" and [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]''.&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; The orchestra's style incorporates a large amount of [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]], intended to allow the orchestra to feel a sense of "collective ownership" of their performances.&lt;ref name=nat-para&gt;{{cite web|last=Champ|first=Gemma|title=The British Paraorchestra hit the right notes|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/on-stage/the-british-paraorchestra-hit-the-right-notes|publisher=The National|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement with the Paralympics===
In 2012, Hazlewood campaigned for the Paraorchestra to be included in the ceremonies of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in London. He felt that their inclusion in this international event would be a unique opportunity for the Paraorchestra and that it could also raise awareness of his cause.&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; The Paraorchestra were ultimately incorporated into the [[2012 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the Games, where it performed alongside British rock band [[Coldplay]] (accompanying them in a performance of "[[Strawberry Swing]]"), and played the [[Paralympic anthem]].&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; The Paraorchestra planned to use the exposure it gained through its role at the Paralympics to add more performers, make [[studio recording]]s, and tour across Europe.&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt;

On 3 December 2012, coinciding with the [[United Nations]]' [[United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities|International Day of Persons with Disabilities]], the British Paraorchestra released a cover of "[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]" as a [[charity single]], in a campaign to be [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas number one]]. Accompanied by the [[Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children]] and notable Britiah paralympians, the single was released to support the [[British Paralympic Association]] in preparation for the [[2014 Winter Paralympics]], along with the Paraorchestra and Kaos Signing Choir themselves.&lt;ref name=ipc-truecolors&gt;{{cite web|title=British Paraorchestra heads for No. 1 this Christmas|url=http://www.paralympic.org/news/british-paraorchestra-heads-no-1-christmas|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paraorchestra was awarded a [[Big Society Award]] in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=British Paraorchestra win Prime Minister's Big Society Award |url=http://www.classicfm.com/music-news/latest-news/british-paraorchestra-big-society-award/ |newspaper=Classic FM |location= |date=26 September 2013 |access-date=29 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The Paraorchestra began with 17 members, but plans to add more in the near future.&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra/&gt; Its members currently include [[Nicholas McCarthy (pianist)|Nicholas McCarthy]], a one-handed pianist who graduated from the [[Royal College of Music]] in 2012, [[Clarence Adoo]], a former jazz trumpet player who was paralysed below the shoulders after a car accident (and now plays an instrument known as "Headspace", which is controlled by breath and head motions, developed for him by [[Rolf Gehlhaar]]), [[Gemma Lunt]], a [[viola]] player who uses a [[wheelchair]] and [[Lyn Levett]], who uses a [[Macintosh]] to play what Hazlewood feels is "dizzyingly creative" [[electronic music]].&lt;ref name=telegraph-paraorchestra&gt;{{cite news|title=One-handed pianist Nicholas McCarthy graduates from Royal College of Music|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9503659/One-handed-pianist-Nicholas-McCarthy-graduates-from-Royal-College-of-Music.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=10 September 2012|location=London|first=Donna|last=Bowater|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blind members of the Paraorchestra include Pianist and violinist [[Abi Baker]], [[James Risdon]] on [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[Matthew Wadsworth]] on the [[lute]], violist [[Takashi Kikuchi]], and multi-instrumentalists [[Baluji Shrivastav]] and [[Ziad Sinno]].&lt;ref name=nat-para/&gt; The Paraorchestra also recently added 15-year-old [[deafness|deaf]] [[viola]] player Tilly Chester to its lineup. Hazlewood had encountered her playing with the [[National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain|National Youth Orchestra]]{{emdash}}of which she is also a member.&lt;ref name=tilly-parabbc&gt;{{cite news|title=Worcester teenager Tilly Chester selected for Paraorchestra|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-19535754|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cairo International Women's Film Festival''' ({{lang-ar|مهرجان القاهرة الدولي لسينما المرأة}}) or '''CIWFF''' is an independent initiative dedicated to introducing films directed by women from around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairowomenfilmfest.com/aboutus/ |title=Cairo International Women Film Festival |website=Cairowomenfilmfest.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; — not necessarily addressing women's issues—to explore the perspectives of female filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3yvbL1Cphw |title=The 7th Cairo International Women's Film Festival Kicks Off |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2014-11-29 |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder and directors of the festival emphasize its goal to be serving as a platform through which films created by women are introduced to the audience as well as 'a meeting point for the audience and filmmakers'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2016/02/28/ninth-cairo-international-womens-film-festival-hosts-60-international-movies/ |title=Ninth Cairo International Women's Film Festival hosts 60 international movies |newspaper=[[Daily News Egypt]] |date=2016-02-28 |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, films are screened at no fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cairo360.com/article/arts-culture/cairo-international-womens-film-festival-unique-festival-returns-for-seventh-edition/ |title=Cairo International Women’s Film Festival: Unique Festival Returns For Seventh Edition &amp;#124; &amp;#124; Cairo 360 Guide to Cairo, Egypt |website=Cairo360.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with both English and Arabic subtitles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film-documentaire.fr/4DACTION/w_fiche_festival/871_3623_1 |title=Portail du film documentaire |website=Film-documentaire.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Q&amp;A sessions, panels and master classes are held with guests of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairowomenfilmfest.com/screening/ |title=Cairo International Women Film Festival |website=Cairowomenfilmfest.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival first came to existence in 2008 in the form of '''Entre Cineastas''' ({{lang-ar|بين سينمائيات}}) or the '''Caravan of Arab and Latin American Women's Films''' ({{lang-ar|قافلة سينما المرأة العربية واللاتينية}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/188201/Arts--Culture/Film/INTERVIEW-Filmmaker-Amal-Ramsis-on-the-th-Cairo-In.aspx |title=INTERVIEW: Filmmaker Amal Ramsis on the 9th Cairo Int'l Women's Film Festival - Film - Arts &amp; Culture - Ahram Online |website=English.ahram.org.eg |date=2016-02-22 |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caravan was held in various Arab, Latin American and Spanish cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cairowomenfilmfest.com/static/CATALOGO%202016%20-%20ENGLISH.pdf |format=PDF |title=9th Cairo International Women's Film Festival |website=Cairowomenfilmfest.com |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the initiative developed to, eventually, expand into the Cairo International Women's Film Festival, and include the Caravan as one of many sections of the festival.&lt;ref name="cairowomenfilmfest1"/&gt;

==Sections, events and activities==
Throughout the festival, master classes and panels are held to introduce filmmakers to the audience and open the floor for themes or film-based discussions.

One pillar of the festival is the One Minute Workshop ({{lang-ar|ورشة أفلام الدقيقة الواحدة}}). This is a workshop instructed by filmmaker and founder of CIWFF, [[Amal Ramsis]], where she teaches non-professional women the basics of making short films in order to write, act, shoot and direct one-minute long films addressing a selected concept. It is held several times around the year in various cities and towns around Egypt and the Arab World, Latin America and Europe in collaboration with the TRAMA network and Drac Màgic—the women's film festival that had launched the initiative in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairowomenfilmfest.com/workshop/ |title=Cairo International Women Film Festival |website=Cairowomenfilmfest.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections of the festival change with every edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com//news/7th-cairo-international-women-s-film-festival-makes-strong-comeback |title=7th Cairo International Women’s Film Festival makes strong comeback |newspaper=[[Egypt Independent]] |date=2014-11-27 |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One integral section, however, is the Caravan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairowomenfilmfest.com/caravan/ |title=Cairo International Women Film Festival |website=Cairowomenfilmfest.com |date=2014-11-16 |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every edition also celebrates one prominent female filmmaker by screening a selection of her films in a section titled ′Tribute to a Cineaste′ and inviting her to conduct Q&amp;A sessions and a panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egypt.nlembassy.org/news/2014/11/dutch-filmmaker-at-the-cairo-international-women%E2%80%99s-film-festival.html |title=Dutch Filmmaker at the Cairo International Women’s Film Festival &amp;#124; Netherlands Embassy in Cairo, Egypt |website=Egypt.nlembassy.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recurring sections are the International Panorama, the Country in Focus and the Guest Festival—which is often a partner women's film festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cairowomenfilmfest.com/archives/ |title=Cairo International Women Film Festival |website=Cairowomenfilmfest.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award==
CIWFF features one award: '''The Audience Award'''. It was first introduced in the 6th edition (2013). All films qualify except films from the Caravan, the Tribute and the Workshop. Through public vote, one film is selected to receive the award. No committee has any say in the selection. Should the audience vote for a short film, the award is divided between the first- and the second-ranking films. It is, then, presented to the director of the winning film—if present—and the film is screened on closing night.

Some films that have won the Audience Award are:

'''The British Catholic Stage Guild''', the main organisation for [[Roman Catholics]] in British entertainment, was founded in 1911. The aim of the Guild, as laid out in the 1931 Year Book, was ''"to establish and encourage spiritual, artistic and social intercourse among [Roman] Catholics connected with the theatrical and allied professions"''. The Guild is now known as the [http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=14489 '''Catholic Association of Performing Arts'''] (CaAPA). 

Its current details include: 
*Address: Corpus Christi Church, #1 Maiden Lane, London, UK, WC2E 7NB 
*Telephone: 020 7240 1221 
*Registered charity number: 267957
*Chair: Frank Comerford 
*CaAPA National Chaplain: Fr Chris Vipers
*CaAPA Chairman of Trustees: Monsignor Vladimir Felzmann 

Current membership includes such noted performers as [[Valerie Masterson]] and [[Simon Callow]], as well as numerous less well-known performers, such as actor Martin O'Brien, who co-founded ACTS (Association of Catholics in Theatre and on Screen) in 2005, and is the current Artistic Director of the CaAPA-affiliated Ten Ten Theatre. 

Deceased former members of the Guild include actors [[Sir Alec Guinness]] (a former Vice-President of the Guild), [[Patricia Hayes]] (who was a former Chair of the Guild, as was her son, actor [[Richard O'Callaghan]]), [[Danny La Rue]], [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] (a former Chair), [[Margaretta Scott]], [[Moira Lister]], [[Eamonn Andrews]] (a former Chair), [[Lionel Jeffries]] (a former Chair) and [[Frank Finlay]]. Guinness and Jeffries were both converts. Member [[Vince Powell]] was a noted television writer and producer. ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'' star [[Joe Gladwin]] was Northern representative before his death.&lt;ref&gt;The Catholic Directory of England and Wales, 1981, pg 393&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Activities of the Guild since then have been numerous and varied, including links with other denominations in services and carols, play readings, Students' Evenings, [[AIDS]] awareness Masses, music halls, recitals, and concerts. 

Past events have included a Memorial Mass for former Vice-President of the Guild, [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]], which was attended by his widow, Dame [[Judi Dench]], and their daughter, actress [[Finty Williams]]; a reception at the Garrick Club for Cardinal [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]], which was hosted by [[Frank Finlay]]. Members of the Catholic Stage Guild and the [[English National Opera]] provided the entertainment; a fund-raising Quiz Night at Holy Apostles Church, [[Pimlico]] and a talk at the CAA, 20 Bedford Street, by [[Piers Paul Read]], the official biographer of the Guild's late Vice-President, Sir [[Alec Guinness]].&lt;ref name="Catholic Stage Guild website"&gt;[http://caapa.org.uk/diary/index.html/ Catholic Stage Guild website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celtic mazes''' are [[Line (mathematics)|straight-line]] [[spiral]] [[pattern|patterns]] that have been drawn all over the world since [[prehistory|prehistoric times]]. The patterns originate in early [[Celts|Celtic]] developments in stone and metal-work, and later in medieval [[Insular art]]. Prehistoric spiral designs date back to [[Gavrinis]] (c. 3500 BCE).&lt;ref name="Meehan"&gt;Meehan, Aidan (1993). ''Celtic Design: Maze Patterns'', pp. 7–8. {{ISBN|0-500-27747-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The straight-line spirals of Celtic labyrinths originated in [[chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] and [[lozenges]] and are drawn by the Celts using a [[connect the dots]] method.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt;

Celtic labyrinths are found among carvings at [[Camonica Valley]], occupied by the Celts early in the first millennium, most older than the one [[Knossos]] or Classical style example found there. The mythology associated with the labyrinths also suggest Celtic origin. For example, the labyrinths containing eyes or a figure with horns and a snake about its waist imply the deity [[Cernunnos]]. Lastly, Celtic examples resembling the Cretan model but featuring path-line reversal (the path of one is traceable as the line of the other) suggest Celtic pre-knowledge of their construction. Methods of constructing  Classical labyrinths from figure with serpent through waist and ocular spiral may be demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt;

'''Charles de Sousy Ricketts''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (2 October 1866 – 7 October 1931) was a versatile English artist, illustrator, author and printer, and is best known for his work as book designer and [[typographer]] from 1896 to 1904 with the '''Vale Press''', and his work in the theatre as a set and costume designer.

==Life and career==
Ricketts was born in [[Geneva]] to a French mother and an English father. He grew up mainly in France and Italy. He began his studies in art at the [[Lambeth School of Art|City and Guilds Technical Art School]] in [[Lambeth]], in 1882, after both his parents had died.

According to [[William Rothenstein]], "Ricketts, with his pale, delicate features, fair hair and pointed red-gold beard, looked like a [[Jean Clouet|Clouet]] drawing. Half French, he had the quick mind and the rapid speech of a southerner."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Image:Charles Haslewood Shannon; Charles de Sousy Ricketts by George Charles Beresford.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles Haslewood Shannon]] and Charles Ricketts by [[George Charles Beresford]]]]
At the Art School he met [[Charles Haslewood Shannon|Charles Shannon]] (1863–1937), painter and lithographer, who would be his lifelong partner in both his artistic and personal life.&lt;ref name="illustrator"&gt;{{citation |title=The Illustrator and the Book in England from 1790 to 1914 |first=Gordon Norton |last=Ray |year=1992 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |isbn=0-486-26955-8 |page=160}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the advice of [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], they settled in England rather than abroad.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Vale Press and artistic career==
They founded ''The Dial'', a magazine, which had five issues from 1889 to 1897, and the Vale Press, named after their house, The Vale, in [[Chelsea, London]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} "The portrait of Ricketts by Shannon was painted two years after Ricketts had founded the Vale Press. It is a record of their friendship, slightly tentative in its character, with Ricketts turning his head away so that he is seen in profile. He liked it precisely for this reason since it shows him 'turning away from the 20th century to think only of the 15th.' It is labelled on the back 'The Man in an Inverness Cloak'."&lt;ref&gt;National Portrait Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricketts was one of two well-known illustrators of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s work, the other being [[Aubrey Beardsley]] who worked on ''Salomé''. He and Shannon were friends and supporters of Wilde, for whom Ricketts painted, in the style of Clouet, the hero of Wilde's short story, 'The Portrait of Mr. W. H.'"&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mikado Ricketts.jpg|thumb|Costume design for ''[[The Mikado]]'', 1926.]]
[[Image:Charles Ricketts06.jpg|thumb|Costume design for Tremouille in [[G. B. Shaw]]'s play [[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]] – Watercolour]]
It was in the work of the Vale Press that Ricketts would find his talents were best employed. The enterprise also involved [[Thomas Sturge Moore]], and later William Llewellyn Hacon (1860–1910), a [[barrister]]. The actual printing was carried out by Ballantyne Press under the supervision of Charles McCall. A total of about 75 books were produced, including a complete [[Shakespeare]] in 39 volumes, before the special type fonts were destroyed. In parallel, Ricketts was involved with the '''Eragny Press''', run by [[Lucien Pissarro]] and his wife Esther, from 1894 to 1914.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

After 1902, he turned more to painting and sculpture. His principal pictures in public galleries are "The Death of Don Juan" ([[Tate Gallery]]), "The Plague" ([[Musée du Luxembourg]], Paris) and "Montezuma" ([[Manchester Art Gallery]]).&lt;ref name="The Times' 1931, p. 7"&gt;''The Times'' obituary, 9 October 1931, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Ricketts also wrote on art, was a collector, and was elected an Associate of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1922 and a full member in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 29 February 1928, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 he was appointed a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission.&lt;ref name="The Times' 1931, p. 7" /&gt; He was also a member of the [[International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers]].&lt;ref name="Gla"&gt;[http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib2_1203018932 "The International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers"], ''Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851–1951'', [[Glasgow University]], accessed 31 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre design===
Ricketts became a celebrated and sought-after designer for the stage. "Mr Ricketts is infallible in his ideas on costume" observed ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 November 1910, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Plays on which he worked included Oscar Wilde's ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' (1906), [[Laurence Binyon]]'s ''Attila'' (1907), ''[[King Lear]]'' (1909), [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[The Dark Lady of the Sonnets|The Dark Lady]]'' (1910), [[Arnold Bennett]]'s ''Judith'' (1916), Shaw's [[Annajanska, the Bolshevik Empress]] (1918), [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s ''The Betrothal'' (1920), Shaw's ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' (1924), ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1926) and [[John Masefield]]'s ''The Coming of Christ'' (1928).&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 June 1909, 25 November 1910, 25 January 1916, 25 November 1920, 17 April 1924, 28 December 1926 and 14 May 1928&lt;/ref&gt; Outside London he worked for the [[Abbey Theatre]], Dublin on plays by [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] and [[J.M. Synge]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 5 January 1933, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Ricketts also designed much-publicised new productions of ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'' for [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Most of Ricketts's costume designs for ''The Mikado'' were retained by subsequent designers for more than 50 years – see Bell, Diana: ''The Complete Gilbert &amp; Sullivan'', Wellfleet Press, New Jersey, 1989, {{ISBN|1-55521-440-1}}, pp. 148–52.  See also [http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/carte/1926/index.html these photos and information about the 1926 ''Mikado'' designs]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael MacLennan]] wrote "Last Romantics", a play based on the life of Ricketts, Shannon and their circle, including [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and [[Michael Field (pseudonym)|Michael Field]].  The play premiered in 2003 and was a finalist for the [[Governor General's Literary Award]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadacouncil.ca/news/releases/2003/qg127245397155625000.htm "The Canada Council for the Arts announces finalists for the 2003 Governor General's Literary Awards"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529170331/http://www.canadacouncil.ca/news/releases/2003/qg127245397155625000.htm |date=29 May 2013 }}.

==Later life and death==
Through his friend, the Russian singer [[Vladimir Rosing]], [[Cecil Arthur Lewis]] met Ricketts and Ricketts became Lewis' artistic mentor and sponsor.  After Ricketts' death, Lewis edited his letters and journals for publication. Part of Ricketts' ashes are buried at Arolo, in the park of the villa that Ricketts donated to Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=213.

'''The Chestnut Street Theatre''' in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] was the first theater in the United States built by entrepreneurs solely as a venue for paying audiences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Chestnut Street Theatre Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Theatre (First Chestnut Street Theatre)==
[[File:Chestnut Street Theatre advertistment, July 1853.png|thumb|left|225px|Advertisement for plays at the Chestnut Street Theatre, July 1853]]

The Chestnut Street Theatre (originally named the New Theatre) was the brainchild of [[Thomas Wignell]] and [[Alexander Reinagle]] who in 1791 convinced a group of Philadelphia investors  to build a theater suitable for Wignell’s company to perform in. Wignell had not yet formed his company when the New Theatre was being set up to be built, but as the New Theater was being built, Wignell was in England recruiting actors to be a part of his company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollock|first=Thomas|title=The Philadelphia Theatre in the Eighteenth Century|year=1968|publisher=Greenwood Press, Publishers|location=New York|pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Theater's design, modeled after the [[Theatre Royal, Bath]],  was made possible by [[John Inigo Richards]], Wignell's brother-in-law, who obtained architect Thomas Greenway’s original plans.&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion to American Theatre"&gt;Oxford Companion to American Theatre&lt;/ref&gt; The New Theatre was built on Chestnut Street near the corner of Sixth Street across from [[Congress Hall]]. $30,000 was raised for the construction of the building and the finale touches were not completed until 1805 under architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The stage ran with a depth of seventy-one feet and had a width of thirty feet. The three tiers of boxes could hold nine hundred people; the theatre itself was able to hold an audience of two thousand. There were multiple dressing rooms, two green rooms, and for the first time in America a large well-stocked wardrobe. There were two different entrances from the street for the theatre patrons, those going to the pit and those headed to the boxes. The entryway to the pit was only eighteen inches wide, a death trap in the event of a fire. Like English theatres the New Theatre on Chestnut Street had all the essentials. A proscenium with proscenium doors in the proscenium walls with a balcony overhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolcott|first=John|title=Theatre History on the Web|publisher=VideOccasions|accessdate=23 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after its construction the New Theatre was often referred to as one of the Seven Wonders of America.&lt;ref&gt;Early Opera in America By Oscar George Theodore Sonneck&lt;/ref&gt; A [[yellow fever]] epidemic spoiled the theater’s debut in 1793, and its first regular season did not begin until the following year when the inaugural night’s entertainment offered a double feature, John O'Keeffe's ''Castle of Andalusia'' and Hannah Cowley's ''Who's the Dupe?''&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion to American Theatre" /&gt; Over the following twenty-seven years the theater would become a showcase for works by local and national dramatist of the day. In 1816 the New Theatre became the first American theater to be illuminated by gas fixtures rather than candlelight or oil lamps. Four years later a suspicious fire destroyed the theater along with its library, music, scenery and costumes. The cause of the fire remained a mystery since the building had been vacant for several days while the company was engaged in Baltimore.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Philadelphia in 1830--1: or, A brief account of the various institutions and Public Objects in the Metropolis – 1830&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Chestnut Street Theatre==
Two years later, the second Chestnut Street Theatre rose from the ashes of the first. It was built in the customary design of the day by architect [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]] with triple tiers of boxes making a horseshoe around the orchestra and apron of the stage that accommodated about 2,000 theatergoers. The façade was made of Italian-style marble with an arcade supported by a row of composite columns with a plain entablature. The entrance stood between two wings whose niches held statues of Tragedy and Comedy by [[William Rush]]. Below the statues were semi-circular recesses containing basso relievos of tragic and comic muses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of Philadelphia, 1609-1884, Volume 2 By [[John Thomas Scharf]], Thompson Westcott 1884&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Chestnut Street Theatre11.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Third Chestnut Street Theatre on the right ({{circa}}1860s)]]

The Chestnut Street Theatre was once again consumed in a fire in 1856 and would not see another curtain rise for six years.&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion to American Theatre"/&gt;{{clear left}}

==Third Chestnut Street Theatre==
The third Chestnut Street Theatre was built in 1862, seven blocks to the west of its original location, where once again it found favor with Philadelphia audiences as a fashionable night spot. Tragic actress [[Jean Hosmer]] was among those who starred at the debut of the third theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sh5LAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=actress+jean+hosmer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zPF_UkAzNx&amp;sig=dr4mNpjm-4eJLOOWwwYE8TBBi8k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU-unww6TaAhWkxYMKHfx2BwMQ6AEIYjAO#v=onepage&amp;q=actress%20jean%20hosmer&amp;f=false|title=The Theatre|date=1890|publisher=Wyman &amp; Sons|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It closed its doors for the last time in 1913 after the curtain fell on the final act of [[Arthur Wing Pinero]]'s ''[[The Second Mrs Tanqueray]]'', and the building was demolished soon afterwards.&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion to American Theatre"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Life and Times of Actress EJ Phillips&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12582">The '''Cultural Objects Name Authority''' (CONA) is a project by the [[Getty Research Institute]] to create a [[controlled vocabulary]] containing authority records for cultural works, including architecture and movable works such as paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, manuscripts, photographs, textiles, ceramics, furniture, other visual media such as frescoes and architectural sculpture, performance art, archaeological artifacts, and various functional objects that are from the realm of material culture and of the type collected by museums.&lt;ref name="Discovery and use of art images on the web: an overview"&gt;{{cite book|title=Short proceedings of the Third International Euro-Mediterranean Conference EuroMed|year=2010|publisher=Archaeolingua Publ.|isbn=978-963-9911-16-1|pages=205–211 [207]|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1942/11909|author=Krassimira, I.|authorlink=Discovery and use of art images on the web: an overview|editor=Ioannides, M. |editor2=D. Fellner |editor3=A. Georgopoulos |editor4=D. Hadjimitsis |accessdate=2 April 2013|format=Proceedings Paper|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of CONA is works cataloged in scholarly literature, museum collections, visual resources collections, archives, libraries, and indexing projects with a primary emphasis on art, architecture, or archaeology. The target users are the visual resources, academic, and museum communities.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Controlled Vocabularies: Terminology for Art, Architecture, and Other Cultural Works"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harpring|first=Patricia|title=Introduction to Controlled Vocabularies: Terminology for Art, Architecture, and Other Cultural Works|year=2010|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=160606018X|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/intro_controlled_vocab/index.html|accessdate=2 April 2013|format=Online Edition|chapter=Vocabularies for Cultural Objects}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the CONA database, each work's record (also called a subject in the database, not to be confused with iconographical depicted subjects of art works) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to each work's record are titles/names, current location, dates, other fields, related works, a parent (that is, a position in the hierarchy), sources for the data, and notes. By using terms from all four Getty Vocabularies to control many of these fields, CONA uses [[linked data]] principles to pull together multiple vocabularies in the creation of an authority file for works of art.&lt;ref name="L.A. meta (data): Exploring vocabulary interoperability in libraries, Archives and Museums"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Erik|author2=T. Kanti Srikantaiah|title=L.A. meta (data): Exploring vocabulary interoperability in libraries, Archives and Museums|journal=Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|year=2012|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–4 [2]|doi=10.1002/meet.14504901280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coverage of CONA is global, from prehistory through the present.

== History ==

Detailed discussions regarding the Getty Vocabulary Program compiling a vocabulary comprising unique numeric identifiers and brief records for art works began in 2004. It was determined that various Getty projects collected data for movable works and architecture that could form an initial data set, upon which other contributors could build over time. The project was enthusiastically embraced by the user community. In 2005 mapping of the data model used for all three existing vocabularies (the [[Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT), the [[Thesaurus for Geographic Names]] (TGN), and the [[Union List of Artist Names]] (ULAN)) to potential CONA fields was completed. The effort coincided with the development of CCO (Cataloging Cultural Objects), a more concise offshoot of the CDWA ([[Categories for the Description of Works of Art]]), and CDWA Lite, which is an XML schema intended to serve as an exchange format for art information. Both CCO and CDWA, which reflect consensus in the user community of best practice in cataloging art and architecture, lay out the required fields and rules for cataloging art objects.

Technical development of CONA began in 2010. The editorial system and online search screens for CONA are similar to those used for the existing Getty vocabularies. The data is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, building complex and changing polyhierarchies, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of CONA is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules.

Contributions to CONA from the user community commenced in 2012. A pilot release of CONA with a limited number of records is currently available online. The growth and utility of CONA will depend upon contributions from users. As with the AAT, TGN, and ULAN, CONA will grow and change via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the [[Getty Vocabulary Program]].

The current manager of the Getty vocabularies is Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor. Administratively, the Vocabulary Program resides under the GRI Collection Management and Description Division (David Farneth, Head). Other GRI departments in this division are General Collection Cataloging, Special Collections Cataloging, Digital Services, the Registrar\x92s Office, Institutional Records and Archives, and Conservation and Preservation. The Vocabulary Program works with Digital Art History Access (Murtha Baca, Head) to foster foreign language translations of the vocabularies, maintain national and international partnerships, and oversee licensing and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/cona/about.html About CONA]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terms ==

The focus of each CONA record is a work of art or architecture. Each work is identified with a unique and persistent numeric ID, which aids in the disambiguation of similar works.&lt;ref name="The Cataloging Cultural Objects experience: Codifying practice for the cultural heritage community"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coburn|first=Erin|title=The Cataloging Cultural Objects experience: Codifying practice for the cultural heritage community|journal=IFLA journal|year=2010|volume=36|issue=1|pages=16–29 [24]|doi=10.1177/0340035209359561|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many fields in CONA, however through titles/names (equivalence relationships), as well as hierarchical and associative relationships, the basic structure of CONA is that of a thesaurus in compliance with ISO and NISO standards. Names or titles may be current, historical, and in various languages.

== Design ==

Although it may be displayed as a list, CONA is a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the CONA hierarchy (Subject_ID: 700000000). There may be multiple broader contexts, making CONA polyhierarchical. In addition to the hierarchical relationships (e.g., between a print and the larger volume to which it belongs), CONA has equivalence relationships (between equivalent titles/names) and associative relationships (e.g., between a sketch and the final work).&lt;ref name="The Getty Vocabularies: “Non-Authoritarian” Authority Files for Art, Architecture, and Material Culture"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baca|first=Murtha|title=The Getty Vocabularies: "Non-Authoritarian" Authority Files for Art, Architecture, and Material Culture|url=http://niso.kavi.com/apps/group_public/download.php/5750/NISOauthdatawebinar9feb2011_WEB.pdf|work=NISO Authority Data &amp; Semantic Web Webinar|accessdate=2 April 2013|format=Webinar|date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary top divisions of CONA are the facets Built Work and Movable Work.

With the exception of performance art, CONA records unique physical works. However, CONA may include works that were never built or that no longer exist, for example designs for a building that was not constructed or a work that has been destroyed.

'''Built Works''':  Built works within the scope of CONA are architecture, which includes structures or parts of structures that are the result of conscious construction, are of practical use, are relatively stable and permanent, and are of a size and scale appropriate for—but not limited to—habitable buildings. Most built works in CONA are manifestations of the built environment that is typically classified as fine art, meaning it is generally considered to have aesthetic value, was designed by an architect (whether or not his or her name is known), and constructed with skilled labor.

'''Movable Works''': The term movable works is borrowed from legal jargon, referring to tangible objects capable of being moved or conveyed from one place to another, as opposed to real estate or other buildings. It is useful to separate the two types of works—built works and movable works—into different facets in CONA because movable works typically are located in a repository, have a repository identification number, have a provenance of former locations, and other characteristics that typically differ from architecture.

Movable works within the scope of CONA include the visual arts that are of the type collected by art museums, although the objects themselves may actually be held by an ethnographic, anthropological, or other museum, or owned by a private collector. Performance art is included in CONA under this facet as well.

The minimum fields and editorial rules of CONA are in compliance with CDWA and CCO.&lt;ref name="Museum Data Exchange: Learning How to Share"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waibel|first=Günter|author2=Ralph LeVan |author3=Bruce Washburn |title=Museum Data Exchange: Learning How to Share|journal=D-Lib Magazine|date=March–April 2010|volume=16|issue=3/4|doi=10.1045/march2010-waibel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The minimum fields are the following: Catalog Level, Object/Work Type, Title or Name, Creator, Creation Date, Measurements, Materials and Techniques, Depicted Subject, and Current Location.

'''Erich Kahn''' (1904–1979) was a German [[Expressionist]], and a survivor of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution of [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Gypsies]] during the events that led to [[World War II]].

==Biography==
He was born and lived in [[Germany]] until, persecuted by Nazis, he found himself imprisoned at the [[Welzheim]] concentration camp. After taking refuge in [[England]], he was interned for a while at [[Hutchinson Internment Camp|Hutchinson Camp]], on the [[Isle of Man]]. He died in [[London]], at the age of 75.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dn.sapo.pt/2005/05/07/boa_vida/gritos_guerra_e_morte_traco_erich_ka.html Gritos de guerra e morte no traço de Erich Kahn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129055944/http://dn.sapo.pt/2005/05/07/boa_vida/gritos_guerra_e_morte_traco_erich_ka.html |date=2006-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Much of Kahn's work has been lost. The main reason being he belonged to what came to be known as the "Forgotten Generation" of German Jewish Expressionism-influenced artists born at the beginning of the 20th century, whose careers were hindered by the ascension of Nazism. Forced into exile to survive, they found themselves forever bereft of their identity, "caught between yesterday and tomorrow".

The [[Berardo Collection]] has acquired a large part of Erich Kahn's body of work, which testifies to the richness of a life that even surpasses the biography ''[[A Painter's Life and Time]]'', written by [[Klaus E. Hinrichsen]], an art historian who was his friend for many years.

{{nihongo|'''''Flower and Snake'''''|花と蛇|Hana to hebi}} ''aka'' '''''Flowers and Serpents''''' (1974) is a Japanese soft-core [[Sadism and masochism|S&amp;M]] film starring [[Naomi Tani]], directed by [[Masaru Konuma]] and produced by [[Nikkatsu]]. Based on a novel by [[Oniroku Dan]] (born 1931), Japan's best-known author of S&amp;M fiction, ''Flower and Snake'' was the first of Nikkatsu’s Roman Porno films to deal with an S&amp;M theme. Together with the later ''[[Wife to be Sacrificed]]'' (also directed by Konuma in 1974, and starring the same female and male leads) this film is credited with starting the S&amp;M Roman Porno series which helped save Nikkatsu from collapse during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Macias-183"&gt;Macias, Patrick. (2001). ''TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion''. (Review of ''Flower and Snake'' by Izumi Evers). Cadence Books, San Francisco. {{ISBN|1-56931-681-3}}, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In a very successful effort to avoid bankruptcy, [[Nikkatsu]], Japan's oldest major film studio, had entered the [[pink film]], or soft-core pornography, genre three years earlier, in 1971, with its popular and critically praised ''Roman Porno'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sato|first=Tadao|authorlink=Tadao Sato|others=Gregory Barrett (trans.)|title=Currents in Japanese Cinema|origyear=1982|edition=paperback|year=1987|publisher=Kodansha|location=Tokyo|isbn=0-87011-815-3|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; However 1974 was proving to be another difficult year for the studio, with no real box-office hits.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser. (1998.) ''Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films''. Vital Books : Asian Cult Cinema Publications. Miami. ({{ISBN|1-889288-52-7}}), p.506-507.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1960s, [[Naomi Tani]] had been known as the "Queen of Pink," the most popular actress in the low-budget, independent "pink films" which dominated Japan's domestic cinematic market. Nikkatsu had been trying to recruit Tani into their ''Roman Porno'' series for years, but she had always refused since the studio had been reluctant to enter the S&amp;M genre, which was Tani's specialty.&lt;ref&gt;Konuma, Masaru. (1998). Interviewed by Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser on November 6, 1998, in ''Asian Cult Cinema'', #22, 1st Quarter, 1999. p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Tani finally agreed to join the studio on the condition that her first film be based on the Oniroku Dan S&amp;M novel ''Flower and Snake''.&lt;ref&gt;Tani, Naomi. Interviewed by Hamamoto, Maki. (1998). "Naomi Tani - An Interview with Nikkatsu's Queen of SM" (Conducted in January 1998 in Kyushu, Japan) in ''Asian Cult Cinema'' Number 19, April 1998. p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Tani had already starred in a ''pink film'' version of Dan's novel entitled {{nihongo|''Flower and Snake: Rearing the Flesh''|花と蛇より　肉の飼育}}, released by Yamabe Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp|first=Jasper|title=Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema|page= 222 |year=2008|publisher=FAB Press|location=Guildford|isbn=978-1-903254-54-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/1968/cr001730.htm|script-title=ja:花と蛇より　肉の飼育|accessdate=2009-12-19|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Japanese Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikkatsu agreed to Tani's conditions, but there remained the problem of convincing Oniroku Dan to allow the studio to film his novel. After lengthy, inconclusive negotiations, Dan invited director Masaru Konuma and scriptwriter Yozo Tanaka&lt;!-- "manager Gomi and producer Matsuoka" were also in attendance --&gt; to his home for "further discussions." In the middle of the meeting, the electrical power suddenly went out, and Dan called for someone to light a candle. At this point, Naomi Tani, in traditional Japanese kimono, appeared in the room with a lantern. Konuma later said, "This was Dan's theatrical sense - his way of saying yes."&lt;ref name="Konuma-22-23"&gt;Konuma, p.22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Director Konuma and script-writer Tanaka both agreed that Dan's novel was unfilmable, and made significant changes to the story. Dan and Naomi Tani both objected to this, and there was considerable friction between the two sides over the story during the writing of the script. Konuma later commented about Naomi Tani's role in this matter, "while we worked on the final script, she was very argumentative. However, I was impressed with her change in attitude after the company's final decision. During the shoot, she never gave us a problem. Instead- she was committed. I admire her professionalism."&lt;ref name="Konuma-22-23"/&gt;

After the film became a huge hit for Nikkatsu, the studio wanted to follow it with a sequel. Oniroku Dan remained bitter and did not agree to participate in the next film, ''[[Wife to be Sacrificed]]'' (1974),&lt;ref name="Konuma-22-23"/&gt; which became even a greater success. Dan did reconcile with the studio however, and continued to have a strong professional relationship with both Nikkatsu and Naomi Tani.&lt;ref&gt;Weisser, p.356.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
Makoto Katagiri (Yasunori Ishizu) is a 30-year-old man living with his mother Miyo (Hiroko Fuji), who operates a pornographic photography business specializing in sadomasochistic content out of her combined home and adult toy store.  As a child, Makoto shot and killed a black American soldier whom he found having sex with his mother.  The incident left Makoto psychologically stunted as well as impotent, and as such his mother and her staff treat Makoto much as a child.  Despite this, Makoto has developed a strong interest in [[BDSM]], though he has no outlet for his interests.

Senzô Tôyama (Nagatoshi Sakamoto) is the elderly owner of the company Makoto works for, and also has an interest in BDSM.  However, his new wife Shizuko ([[Naomi Tani]]) refuses to let Senzô tie her up or even watch her bathe; instead he vents his frustrations and needs on their housemaid Haru (Hijiri Abe), forcing her to indulge in his need for S&amp;M.  After finding some bondage pornography in Makoto's desk, Senzô summons Makoto to his home, where he first asks, then orders Makoto to kidnap and "train" his wife in order to break her pride so that she will submit to his desires.  After some hesitation, Makoto agrees.

While in town, Senzô drugs Shizuko's tea with sleeping pills, allowing Makoto to leave with her in his vehicle.  On the way home Makoto stops in a field and attempts to rape the semi-conscious Shizuko, but his arousal brings on a hallucination of the black soldier he killed, forcing him to stop.  At home, Shizuko awakes to find herself tied up and calls for help, attracting the attention of Miyo.  Rather than helping the woman, Miyo seems pleased at her son's actions, and encourages him to rape Shizuko.  When he says he can't because she is too beautiful, Miyo suggests Makoto give Shizuko an enema to overcome that impression.  He does, and after watching her expel it finds he is able to become aroused without issue.  He rapes Shizuko while his mother listens outside his room.

Makoto reports his progress to Senzô regularly, providing tapes and even physical evidence of his wife's continued training.  However, he also finds himself becoming attached to Shizuko.  Makoto returns home one day to find his mother and her staff have been torturing Shizuko while he was at work.  He orders them off of her angrily, telling them not to touch her unless he is present.  Shizuko finds herself becoming more at ease with her situation and Makoto, and later asks him if he will protect her; he says yes, going on to say he wants to spend the rest of his life with her.  He tells his mother this, and when she objects he responds angrily, calling her an old hag.

One day Makoto returns home to find Shizuko tied up and being used by the black soldier from his dreams.  He recoils in horror when the man rises to attack him.  His mother then steps in, paying the man, revealing that she staged the scene with a look-alike to render Makoto impotent once more.  Makoto tries to have sex with Shizuko again, despairing when he finds that his impotence has returned.  Despite this, he keeps training her, even taking her outside for a walk.  Taking a chance, he unties her so that she might use the restroom; after a long, worrying delay, Shizuko returns, to the delight of Makoto.  Later the two go to watch a pornographic film, which features a black man who resembles the soldier from Makoto's dreams.  Uncomfortable at first, Makoto starts to remember his childhood incident in detail, eventually remembering that it was his mother who shot the man, not him.  Overjoyed, Makoto calls his mother from a public phone booth to tell her he has remembered the truth, letting her listen as he has sex with Shizuko during the call.

Finally, Senzô arrives to reclaim his wife.  Makoto is surprised when Shizuko moves to her husband's side eagerly.  He asks her to divorce him so that they might marry, but she refuses, saying that she is now happy since Makoto made her a "total slut" just as her husband wanted.  However, she offers to let him come with the two of them, and though hesitant, Makoto agrees.  Miyo begs her son not to go, but the three pile into Senzô's vehicle and leave, a distraught Miyo running after the vehicle in vain.  The film ends with Shizuko bound, being ravaged simultaneously by Senzô and Makoto while Haru watches in shock.

== Critical appraisal ==
''Flower and Snake'' is considered important more from a  historical standpoint than for its artistic merits. The later ''Wife to be Sacrificed'' is more highly regarded by the critics. Oniroku Dan was not happy with the film, but was able to reconcile with Nikkatsu to continue making many more films from his novels, including ''Wife to be Sacrificed.'' Izumi Evers notes that "Nikkatsu's somewhat innocent approach inadvertently adds comedy," but sums up her review of ''Flower and Snake'' with, "The heroine, who was masochistically trained by men, was actually controlling them the whole time. To me, despite all the humiliations suffered by heroines like Naomi, this is the fundamental truth behind seventies-era Japanese sex films."&lt;ref name="Macias-183"/&gt; The Weissers call it "Well-made garbage," but add that it is one of the best of Nikkatsu's films in this genre.&lt;ref name="Weisser-155"&gt;Weisser, p.155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
[[Media Blasters]] has announced an all-region [[DVD]] release of ''Flower and Snake'' on its ''Tokyo Shock'' label, scheduled for August 28, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Flower-Snake-74-Masaru-Konuma/dp/B000QGDXI4/|title=Flower and Snake '74 (1974)|accessdate=2007-07-05|work=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gilling sword''' is an Anglo-Saxon sword, dating from the late 9th to early 10th centuries AD, found by a schoolboy in a river in 1976 and subsequently acquired by the [[Yorkshire Museum]].

==Discovery==
The sword was discovered on 9 April 1976 by nine-year old Gary Fridd on the north side of Gilling Beck, in [[Gilling West]], [[North Yorkshire]]. At the Coroner's inquisition for [[Treasure trove#England and Wales common law|treasure trove]], held in September of the same year, a police officer identified the find spot as "33 feet east of a bridge and two feet from the water's edge". He also identified that a mechanical extractor had recently been working in the area where the sword was found, offering a reason for its unusual discovery. The sword was not declared treasure and became the property of the finder.&lt;ref name='March'&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol30/30_093_099.pdf |author1=Watkin, J. R. |date=1986 |title=A late Anglo-Saxon sword from Gilling West, N. Yorkshire |journal=Medieval Archaeology |volume=30 |page=93&amp;ndash;99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finder appeared on the children's television programme ''[[Blue Peter]]'' to talk about his discovery and both he and the sword were awarded [[Blue Peter badge|''Blue Peter'' badges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A heritage to treasure |url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/5022865.a-heritage-to-treasure/ |accessdate=9 November 2018 |publisher=Northern Echo |date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='YM'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yorkshiremuseum.org.uk/collections/collections-highlights/the-gilling-sword/ | title=Collections Highlights: The Gilling Sword |publisher=Yorkshire Museum |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The sword was purchased at auction by the Yorkshire Museum in 1977.&lt;ref name='March' /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Gilling Sword - hilt - YORYM 1977 51.JPG|thumb|Detail of the decoration on the hilt]]
The whole sword measures {{convert|838|mm}} in length, with a maximum width of {{convert|86|mm}} across the guard. The sword blade is [[:wiktionary:bifacial|bifacial]] (double edged) and the hilt is decorated in silver with a combination of geometric and [[:wiktionary:floriate|floriate]] (depicting flowers, leaves and foliage) designs.&lt;ref name='YM' /&gt;

The blade itself measures {{convert|700|mm}} in length from the guard. It tapers gradually from the guard, where it measures {{convert|52|mm}} wide. The blade has a shallow [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]] along its length and traces of [[pattern-welding]] are visible on its surface. The pommel is decorated with strips of silver and five matching strips are visible across the grip.&lt;ref name='March' /&gt;

==Significance==
The form and decoration of the Gilling sword places it within a  group of late Anglo-Saxon swords classified as 'type L'; regarded as typical Anglo-Saxon swords of the Viking period and it has been compared to a similar example from [[Fiskerton, Lincolnshire]]. The sword may originally have derived from a grave, which had been disturbed by the mechanical excavator mentioned in the Coroner's report.&lt;ref name='March' /&gt;

==Public display==
[[File:Gilling sword (Yorkshire Museum).jpg|thumb|The Gilling sword on display in the Yorkshire Museum in 2010]]
The sword is in the collection of the Yorkshire Museum. It appeared in the exhibition "The Vikings in England", which was opened by the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] on 30 March 1982 and was seen by over 235,000 visitors before it closed in October of the same year. This exhibition was awarded the [[European Museum of the Year Award|European Museum of the Year]] Special Exhibition Award as a result of the presentation of the exhibition in the Museum and for additional educational projects organised by the curator [[Elizabeth Hartley (archaeologist)|Elizabeth Hartley]].&lt;ref name ='Pyrah'&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pyrah, B.

When the Museum was closed in 2010 for a major refurbishment, the Gilling sword (along with the other key objects from the Museum) were displayed at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/york/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8512000/8512052.stm |author1=Green, C. |date=12 February 2010 |title=York's medieval treasures on show at the British Museum  |publisher=BBC York &amp; North Yorkshire |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It returned to the Yorkshire Museum for the new exhibition opening on 1 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2010/jul/28/yorkshire-museum |title=Yorkshire Museum gets a makeover |author1=Kennedy, M. |date=30 July 2010 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 it was included in the permanent medieval exhibition "Capital of the North".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10328057.Bigging_up_the_North/

From 2017 it formed part of a touring exhibition titled 'Viking: Rediscover the Legend' and is displayed alongside the [[Vale of York Hoard]] and the [[Cuerdale Hoard]], with the tour starting at the Yorkshire Museum and subsequently including [[Atkinson Art Gallery and Library]] in Southport, [[Norwich Castle Museum]], and the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/15282835.Face_to_face_with_the_Vikings/ |author1=Lewis, S. |title=Face to face with the Vikings |date=12 May 2017 |publisher=[[York Press]] |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.minsterfm.com/news/local/2291242/a-new-understanding-of-the-vikings/ |title=A new understanding of the Vikings |publisher=[[Minster FM]] News |date=18 May 2017 |accessdate= 24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/reviews/review-vikings-rediscover-legend.htm |title=Review – Viking: Rediscover the Legend |author1=Hilts, C. |date=30 October 2017 |publisher=Current Archaeology |accessdate= 5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rom, Domitilla-Katakomben, Der gute Hirte.jpg|thumb|200px|The Good Shepherd, c. 300-350, at the [[Catacombs of Rome#Catacombs of Domitilla|Catacombs of Domitilla]], [[Rome]]]]
The '''Good Shepherd''' ({{lang-el|ποιμήν ο καλός}}, ''poimḗn o kalós'') is an image used in the [[pericope]] of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#10:1|John 10:1-21]], in which [[Jesus Christ]] is depicted as the Good [[Shepherd]] who lays down his life for his [[sheep]]. Similar imagery is used in [[Psalm 23]]. The Good Shepherd is also discussed in the other gospels, the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], the [[First Epistle of Peter]] and the [[Book of Revelation]].

==Biblical references==
In the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus states "I am the good shepherd" in two verses, {{bibleverse||John|10:11|NIV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||John|10:14|NIV}}.

From {{bibleref|John|10:11-18}} ([[World Hindi Bible|WEB]]):

{{quote|I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them. The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn't care for the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I'm known by my own; even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd. Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.}}

This passage is one of several sections of John's Gospel which generate division among the Jews:
:"There was a division again among the Jews because of these sayings. Many of them said, 'He has a demon and is mad. Why do you listen to Him?' Others said, 'These are not the words of one who has a demon'. ({{bibleverse||John|10:19-21|NKJV}})

[[File:Good shepherd 02b close.jpg|thumb|[[Allegory]] of Christ &lt;ref&gt;"The figure (...) is an allegory of Christ as the shepherd" Andre Grabard, "Christian iconography, a study of its origins", {{ISBN|0-691-01830-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]], 3rd century.]]
Jesus Christ is also compared to a shepherd in {{bibleverse||Matthew|2:6|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|9:36|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|25:32|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:31|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|6:34|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|14:27|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||John|10:2|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|13:20|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:25|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|5:4|NIV}}, and {{bibleverse||Revelation|7:17|NIV}}.

==Parable or metaphor?==
Several authors such as Tinto, Barbara Reid, Arland Hultgren or Donald Griggs comment that "parables are noticeably absent from the Gospel of John".&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Reid, 2001 ''Parables for Preachers'' {{ISBN|0-8146-2550-9}} page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arland J. Hultgren, 2002 ''The Parables of Jesus'' {{ISBN|0-8028-6077-X}} page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Griggs, 2003 ''The Bible from scratch'' {{ISBN|0-664-22577-2}} page 52&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on Parables:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Parables|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There are no [[parables]] in St. John's Gospel" and according to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' article on Gospel of St. John:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=John, Gospel of St |volume=15 |pages=452–458 |first=Friedrich |last=von Hügel}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Here Jesus' teaching contains no parables and but three allegories, the [[Synoptic Gospels|Synoptists]] present it as parabolic through and through."

==Early Christian art==
The image of the Good Shepherd is the most common of the symbolic [[Depiction of Jesus|representations of Christ]] found in [[early Christian art]] in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], before Christian imagery could be made explicit. The form of the image showing a young man carrying a lamb round his neck was directly borrowed from the much older pagan [[kriophoros]] (see below) and in the case of portable statuettes like the most famous one now in the [[Pio Cristiano Museum]], [[Vatican City]] (right), it is impossible to say whether the image was originally created with the intention of having a Christian significance.  The image continued to be used in the centuries after Christianity was [[Edict of Milan|legalized in 313]]. Initially it was probably not understood as a portrait of Jesus, but a symbol like others used in Early Christian art,&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Syndicus; ''Early Christian Art''; pp. 21-3, Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases may also have represented [[the Shepherd of Hermas]], a popular Christian literary work of the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Faces of Jesus'' by Robin M. Jensen, ''Bible Review'', 17.8, October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Early Christian Art'' by Robin M. Jensen, Routledge, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by about the 5th century, the figure more often took on the appearance of the conventional depiction of Christ, as it had developed by this time, and was given a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] and rich robes,&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 130-131&lt;/ref&gt; as on the [[apse]] [[mosaic]] in the church of [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]] in Rome, or at [[Ravenna]] (right). Images of the Good Shepherd often include a sheep on his shoulders, as in the Lukan version of the [[Parable of the Lost Sheep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Lowrie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0fwCGTzbMQ0C&amp;pg=PA69 |title=Art in the Early Church |publisher= Pantheon Books|year= 1947 |isbn= 1-4067-5291-6|page= 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pagan symbolism ==
{{main|Kriophoros}}
[[File:Hermes crioforo.jpg|thumb|upright|Late Roman marble copy of the ''[[Kriophoros]]'' of [[Calamis (5th century BC)|Kalamis]] ([[Museo Barracco]], Rome)]]

In ancient Greek cult, [[kriophoros]] or ''criophorus'' (Κριοφόρος), the "ram-bearer" is a figure that commemorates the solemn sacrifice of a [[Sheep|ram]]. It becomes an [[epithet]] of [[Hermes]]: ''Hermes Kriophoros''.

In two-dimensional art, ''Hermes Kriophoros'' transformed into the Christ carrying a lamb and walking among his sheep: "Thus we find philosophers holding scrolls or a Hermes Kriophoros which can be turned into Christ giving the Law ([[Traditio Legis]]) and the Good Shepherd respectively".&lt;ref&gt;Peter and Linda Murray, ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Art and architecture'', p.&amp;nbsp;475.&lt;/ref&gt; The Good Shepherd is a common motif from the [[Catacombs of Rome]] (Gardner, 10, fig 54) and in [[sarcophagus]] reliefs, where Christian and pagan symbolism are often combined, making secure identifications difficult.

A '''graphics coordinator''', '''GC''', or '''font assist''' is an individual who works, usually on a [[television]] show, as a [[Television producer|producer]] of on-air [[graphics|still]] and [[motion graphics]].  The graphics coordinator decides what content should be displayed on-air - such as on a fullpage (a full-screen graphic) or a [[lower third]] (a bar graphic appearing in the lower third of the screen).  The GC should not be confused with the [[Operator (profession)|Operator]], who usually operates a [[character generator]] (CG) and is part of a [[television crew]], or a [[broadcast designer]] who physically creates the graphics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://study.com/articles/Graphics_Coordinator_Job_Information_for_Students_Considering_a_Career_as_a_Graphics_Coordinator.html study.com Graphics Coordinator: Job &amp; Career Info]&lt;/ref&gt;

A CG ([[3D computer graphics]]) coordinator or supervisor plays an important role in [[film]] and television productions.  His or her role is to supervise, manage, and administer the [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) digital production [[computer animation]] [[workflow]] for the film or [[television show]].  He or she is also there at client meetings and [[conference call]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mymajors.com/career/graphics-coordinator/ mymajors.com Graphics Coordinator: Career]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CG supervisor generally is in charge or has senior input regarding artist management and resource planning, and also plays a senior role in digital productions.  While it is a creative role, most supervisors possess a strong technical background and are capable of making informed decisions about the most efficient and effective techniques to employ in order to solve the problem at hand.  Often, a supervisor will work in tandem with a [[visual effects producer]], [[VFX creative director]] and [[visual effects supervisor]].

Specific responsibilities vary somewhat, depending on the nature of the production; however, most supervisors:
* Handle a CG project from conception through to completion;
* Manage and direct the technical, artistic, and production staff;
* Possess a knowledge of various computer graphic techniques, with emphasis on technical aspects, pipelines, and general film knowledge; 
* Constantly improve workflow and artist training, with an eye on efficiency;
* Collaborate on the bidding and negotiation processes.

There is no union for CG supervisors; however, the [[Visual Effects Society]] is a prominent [[trade organization]] representing the interests of visual effects [[professional]]s.

[[File:Soap Bubble - foliage background - iridescent colours - Traquair 040801.jpg|thumb|right|Iridescence in [[soap bubble]]s]]

'''Iridescence''' (also known as '''goniochromism''') is the phenomenon of certain surfaces that appear to [[Gradient|gradually]] change [[colour]] as the angle of view or the angle of illumination changes. Examples of iridescence include [[soap bubble]]s, [[butterfly]] wings and [[seashell]]s, as well as certain minerals. It is often created by [[structural coloration]] (microstructures that interfere with light).

'''Pearlescence''' is a related effect where some or all of the reflected light is white, where iridescent effects produce only other colours.  The term pearlescent is used to describe certain paint finishes, usually in the automotive industry, which actually produce iridescent effects.

== Etymology ==
The word ''iridescence'' is derived in part from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ἶρις ''îris'' ([[Genitive|gen.]] ἴριδος ''íridos''), meaning ''[[rainbow]]'', and is combined with the Latin suffix ''-escent'', meaning "having a tendency toward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-escent|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407103248/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-escent|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iris in turn derives from the goddess [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]] of [[Greek mythology]], who is the personification of the [[rainbow]] and acted as a messenger of the gods. ''Goniochromism'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''gonia'', meaning "angle", and ''chroma'', meaning "colour".

== Mechanisms ==
[[File:Dieselrainbow.jpg|thumb|Fuel on top of water creates a thin film, which interferes with the light, producing different colours. The different bands represent different thicknesses in the film.]]

Iridescence is an [[optical phenomenon]] of surfaces in which [[hue]] changes with the angle of observation and the angle of illumination.&lt;ref name="srinivasarao"&gt;[http://mohan.mse.gatech.edu/publication/1999_Chem%20Rev_v99_p1935.pdf Nano-optics in the biological world: beetles, butterflies, birds and moths] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909193931/http://mohan.mse.gatech.edu/publication/1999_Chem%20Rev_v99_p1935.pdf |date=2014-09-09 }} Srinivasarao, M.

Prog. Phys. 71: 076401&lt;/ref&gt; It is often caused by multiple reflections from two or more semi-transparent surfaces in which [[phase (waves)|phase shift]] and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of the reflections [[amplitude modulation|modulates]] the incidental [[light]] (by amplifying or attenuating some frequencies more than others).&lt;ref name="srinivasarao" /&gt;&lt;ref name="meadows"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meadows M. | year = 2009 | title = Iridescence: views from many angles | url = http://171.66.127.193/content/6/Suppl_2/S107.full | journal = J.

Iridescence can for example be due to [[thin-film interference]], the functional analogue of selective wavelength attenuation as seen with the [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer]], and can be seen in oil films on water and soap bubbles. Iridescence is also found in plants, animals and many other items. The range of colours of natural iridescent objects can be narrow, for example shifting between two or three colours as the viewing angle changes,&lt;ref name="yoshioka"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yoshioka S. | year = 2011 | title = Mechanism of variable structural colour in the neon tetra: quantitative evaluation of the Venetian blind model | url = http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/54/56.long | journal = J.

Iridescence can also be created by [[diffraction]]. This is found in items like CDs, DVDs, some types of [[prism]]s, or [[cloud iridescence]].&lt;ref&gt;''Meteorology'' By Professor of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences University of Wisconsin-Madison Director Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (Cimss) Steven A Ackerman, Steven A. Ackerman, John A. Knox -- Jones and Bartlett Learning 2013 Page 173-175&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of diffraction, the entire rainbow of colours will typically be observed as the viewing angle changes. In biology, this type of iridescence results from the formation of [[diffraction grating]]s on the surface, such as the long rows of cells in [[striated muscle]], or the specialized abdominal scales of peacock spider ''Maratus robinsoni'' and ''M. chrysomelas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsiung|first=Bor-Kai|last2=Siddique|first2=Radwanul Hasan|last3=Stavenga|first3=Doekele G.|last4=Otto|first4=Jürgen C.|last5=Allen|first5=Michael C.|last6=Liu|first6=Ying|last7=Lu|first7=Yong-Feng|last8=Deheyn|first8=Dimitri D.|last9=Shawkey|first9=Matthew D.|date=2017-12-22|title=Rainbow peacock spiders inspire miniature super-iridescent optics|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02451-x|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=8|issue=|pages=2278|doi=10.1038/s41467-017-02451-x|issn=2041-1723|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of flower petals can also generate a diffraction grating, but the iridescence is not visible to humans and flower-visiting insects as the diffraction signal is masked by the coloration due to [[plant pigments]].&lt;ref&gt;Nature's palette: the science of plant colour.

In biological (and [[biomimetic]]) uses, colours produced other than with [[pigment]]s or [[dye]]s are called [[structural coloration]]&lt;!-- -or- is UK spelling here --&gt;. Microstructures, often multilayered, are used to produce bright but sometimes non-iridescent colours: quite elaborate arrangements are needed to avoid reflecting different colours in different directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsiung|first=Bor-Kai|last2=Siddique|first2=Radwanul Hasan|last3=Jiang|first3=Lijia|last4=Liu|first4=Ying|last5=Lu|first5=Yongfeng|last6=Shawkey|first6=Matthew D.|last7=Blackledge|first7=Todd A.|date=2017-01-15|title=Tarantula-Inspired Noniridescent Photonics with Long-Range Order|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adom.201600599/abstract|journal=Advanced Optical Materials|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=1600599|doi=10.1002/adom.201600599|issn=2195-1071|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural coloration has been understood in general terms since [[Robert Hooke]]'s 1665 book ''[[Micrographia]]'', where Hooke correctly noted that since the iridescence of a [[peacock]]'s feather was lost when it was plunged into water, but reappeared when it was returned to the air, pigments could not be responsible.&lt;ref name=HookeOnPeacockIridescence&gt;Hooke, Robert.

==== Plants ====
[[File:Iridescent_begonia.jpg|thumb|Iridescent ''[[Begonia]]'' leaf]]

Many groups of plants have developed iridescence as an adaptation to use more light in dark environments such as the lower levels of tropical forests. The leaves of Southeast Asia's ''Begonia pavonina'', or peacock begonia, appear iridescent azure to human observers due to each leaf's thinly layered photosynthetic structures called iridoplasts that absorb and bend light much like a film of oil over water. Iridescences based on multiple layers of cells are also found in the lycophyte ''[[Selaginella]]'' and several species of ferns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Glover |first=Beverley J. |last2=Whitney |first2=Heather M. |date=April 2010 |title=Structural colour and iridescence in plants: the poorly studied relations of pigment colour |url=https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/105/4/505/190572 |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=505–511 |doi=10.1093/aob/mcq007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116202157/https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/105/4/505/190572 |archivedate=2017-11-16 |df= |pmc=2850791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Graham |first=Rita M. |last2=Lee |first2=David W. |last3=Norstog |first3=Knut |date=1993 |title=Physical and Ultrastructural Basis of Blue Leaf Iridescence in Two Neotropical Ferns |jstor=2445040 |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=198–203 |doi=10.2307/2445040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams''''' is a collection of short stories by [[Sylvia Plath]]. It was [[wikt:Special:Search/posthumous|posthumously]] published in 1977 as a collection of thirteen short stories, including the title story.

As more of Plath's work was unearthed down the years, a second edition was published with many new stories. The second edition is split into four parts, and includes many new stories, some of which were very personal to Plath. As Plath's husband at the time of her death in 1963, fellow poet and writer [[Ted Hughes]] managed the publication and distribution of all her unpublished works, including her poetry.

The English Band [[Tears for Fears]] has [[Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams (song)|a song named after this work]].

'''''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Luncheon on the Grass'') – originally titled '''''Le Bain''''' (''The Bath'') – is a large [[oil on canvas]] painting by [[Édouard Manet]] created in 1862 and 1863. It depicts a [[female nude]] and a scantily dressed female bather on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. Rejected by the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit this and two other paintings in the 1863 [[Salon des Refusés]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k114147v Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, gravure, lithographie et architecture : refusés par le Jury de 1863 et exposés, par décision de S.M. l'Empereur au salon annexe, palais des Champs-Elysées, le 15 mai 1863, Édouard Manet, ''Le Bain'', no. 363], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt; where the painting sparked public notoriety and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boime|first=Albert|title=Art in an Age of Civil Struggle|year=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-226-06328-7|pages=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire_id/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe-7123.html?no_cache=1&amp;cHash=48427e6bdb Musée d'Orsay, Le déjeuner sur l'herbe (Luncheon on the Grass)]&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller, earlier version can be seen at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art#The Courtauld Gallery|Courtauld Gallery]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/images/gallery/2454912b.html The Courtauld Gallery version]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and context==
The painting features a nude woman casually lunching with two fully dressed men. Her body is starkly lit and she stares directly at the viewer. The two men, dressed as young [[dandy|dandies]], seem to be engaged in conversation, ignoring the woman. In front of them, the woman's clothes, a basket of fruit, and a round loaf of bread are displayed, as in a [[still life]]. In the background, a lightly clad woman bathes in a stream. Too large in comparison with the figures in the foreground, she seems to float above them. The roughly painted background lacks depth, giving the viewer the impression that the scene is not taking place outdoors, but in a studio. This impression is reinforced by the use of broad "studio" light, which casts almost no shadows. The man on the right wears a flat hat with a tassel, a kind normally worn indoors.

Despite the mundane subject, Manet deliberately chose a large canvas size, measuring 81.9 x 104.1&amp;nbsp;in (208 by 264.5 cm), normally reserved for historical, religious, and mythological subjects.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Paul Hayes|title=Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|pages=5–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of the painting breaks with the academic traditions of the time. He did not try to hide the brush strokes; the painting even looks unfinished in some parts of the scene. The nude is also starkly different from the smooth, flawless figures of [[Alexandre Cabanel|Cabanel]] or [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]].

A nude woman casually lunching with fully dressed men was an affront to audiences' sense of propriety, though [[Émile Zola]], a contemporary of Manet's, argued that this was not uncommon in paintings found in the [[Louvre]]. Zola also felt that such a reaction came from viewing art differently than "analytic" painters like Manet, who use a painting's subject as a pretext to paint.

There is much still not known about the painting, such as when Manet actually began painting it, exactly how he got the idea, and how and what sort of preparation works he did.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt; Though Manet had claimed this piece was once valued at 25,000 Francs in 1871, it actually remained in his possession until 1878 when [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]], opera-singer and collector, bought it for just 2,600 Francs.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;

==Figures in the painting==
The figures of this painting are a testament to how deeply connected Manet was to ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe''. Some assume that the landscape of the painting is meant to be [[L'Île-Saint-Denis|l’île Saint-Ouen]], which was just up [[the Seine]] from his family property in [[Gennevilliers]]. Manet often used real models and people he knew as reference during his creation process.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Carol|title="To Paint, To Point, To Pose" Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|pages=93–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female nude is thought to be [[Victorine Meurent]], the woman who became his favorite and frequently portrayed model, who later was the subject of [[Olympia (Manet)|''Olympia'']]. The male figure on the right was based on a combination of his two brothers, Eugène and Gustave Manet. The other man is based on his brother-in-law, Dutch sculptor {{ill|Ferdinand Leenhoff|fr}}. Nancy Locke referred to this scene as Manet’s family portrait.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;

==Interactions of the figures==
What many critics find shocking about this painting is the interaction, or lack thereof, between the three main subjects in the foreground and the woman bathing in the background. There are many contrasting qualities to the painting that juxtapose and distance the female nude from the other two male subjects. For example, the feminine versus the masculine, the naked versus the clothed, and the white color palette versus the dark color palette creates a clear social difference between the men and the woman.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt; Additionally, some viewers are intrigued by the questions raised by the gaze of the nude woman. It is indeterminable whether she is challenging or accepting the viewer, looking past the viewer, engaging the viewer, or even looking at the viewer at all. This encounter identifies the gaze as a figure of the painting itself, as well as the figure object of the woman’s gaze.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;

==Inspirations==
As with the later ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' (1863) and other works, Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]'s engraving ''The Judgment of Paris'' (c. 1515) after a drawing by [[Raphael]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;Ross King. ''The Judgement of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade that Gave the World Impressionism''. New York: Waller &amp; Company, 2006 {{ISBN|0-8027-1466-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael was an artist revered by the conservative members of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] and his paintings were part of the teaching programme at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], where copies of fifty-two images from his most celebrated frescoes were permanently on display. ''Le Bain'' (an early title for ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe'') was therefore, in many ways, a defiant painting. Manet was cheekily reworking Raphael, turning a mythological scene from one of the most celebrated engravings of the [[Renaissance]] into a tableau of somewhat vulgar Parisian holidaymakers.&lt;ref&gt;Ross King, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Antoine Watteau - La Partie carrée.jpg|[[Antoine Watteau]], ''La Partie Carrée,'' (c. 1713)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Scholars also cite two works as important precedents for Manet's painting ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe'': ''The Pastoral Concert'' by [[Giorgione]] or possibly [[Titian]] (in the [[Louvre]]) and Giorgione's [[The Tempest (painting)|''The Tempest'']], both of which are famous [[Renaissance]] paintings.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt; ''The Tempest'', which also features a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting, offers an important precedent for Manet's painting ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe.''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rewald]],''The History of Impressionism'', [[The Museum of Modern Art]], 4th revised edition 1973, (1st 1946, 2nd 1955, 3rd 1961), p. 85. {{ISBN|0-87070-369-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pastoral Concert'' even more closely resembles ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe,'' as it features two dressed men seated in a rural setting, with two undressed women. ''Pastoral Concert'' is in the collection of the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]] and is likely, therefore, to have been studied by Manet.

According to Proust, he and Manet had been lounging by the Seine as they spotted a woman bathing in the river. This prompted Manet to say, "I copied Giorgione’s women, the women with musicians. It’s black that painting. The ground has come through. I want to redo it and do it with a transparent atmosphere with people like those we see over there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laessøe|first1=Rolf|title=Édouard Manet's "Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe" as a Veiled Allegory of Painting|journal=Artibus et Historiae|date=2005|volume=26|issue=51|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be a connection between ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe'' and the work of [[Jean Antoine Watteau]].&lt;ref name="Fried"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fried|first1=Michael|title=Manet's Modernism or, The Face of Painting in the 1860s|date=1996|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manet’s original title, ''Le Bain'', initially drew the main attention to the woman near the water. This bathing figure alone is quite similar to the figure in Watteau’s ''Le Villageoise'', as both women crouch or lean over near water, simultaneously holding up their skirts. It’s possible that Manet adapted this pose, which is more clearly seen in a sketch of his years before his creation of ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe''.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

==Critique and controversy==
There were many mixed reviews and responses to ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe'' when it was first displayed&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k108159t Fernand Desnoyers, ''La peinture en 1863 : Salon des refusés'', A. Dutil (Paris) 1863], Bibliothèque nationale de France (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; and it continues to yield a variety of responses.  The initial response was characterized by its blunt rejection from the Paris Salon and subsequent display in the [[Salon des Refusés]]. Though many critiques were rooted in confusion about the piece, they were not always completely negative.&lt;ref name="McCauley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCauley|first1=Anne|title="Sex and the Salon" Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Odilon Redon]], for example, did not like it. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in [[Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''.
* [[Le Capitaine Pompilius]], a contributor for ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', thought the characteristically "male" colors of the piece brought the countryside into the salon, but thought the painting was underdeveloped.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary|Castagnary]], appreciator of realist works, identified it as a nice sketch but said it lacked sincerity and lost the definition of the anatomy of the subjects. He also described Manet’s painting technique as "flabby".&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Arthur Stevens, contributor for ''[[Le Figaro]]'', praised Manet as a talented colorist but felt that he neglected form and modeling in this piece.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger|Thoré]], Paul, and Louvet loved the energy of the colors but found the brush strokes to be uneven.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;

One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution present at that time in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], a large park on the western outskirts of Paris. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Gartner, ''Art and Architecture: Musée d'Orsay'', 2001, p. 180. {{ISBN|0-7607-2889-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Bois de Boulogne is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, just as it had been in the 19th century.

=== Critiques of the subject matter ===
* Louis Étienne characterized the painting as a puzzle, while describing the nude female as "a Bréda of some sort, as nude as possible, lolling boldly between two swells dressed to the teeth. These two persons look like high school students on holiday, committing a great sin to prove their manhood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1141487 Louis Étienne, ''Le jury et les exposants: salon des refusés'', Paris, 1863, p. 30.], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Arthur Stevens could not understand what the painting was saying.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Didier de Montchaux found the subject to be "fairly scabrous".&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Thoré described the nude as an ugly and risqué subject matter, while describing the male on the right as one "who doesn’t even think of taking off his horrible padded hat outdoors…It’s the contrast between such an antipathetic animal to the character of a pastoral scene, and this undraped bather, that is shocking."&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* [[Philip Gilbert Hamerton|Philip Hamerton]], an English painter and contributor at the ''Fine Arts Quarterly'', had an affinity for the characteristic photographic detail of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] paintings. Though he did recognize the inspiration from Giorgione, he found Manet’s modern realism to be offensive in this situation. His disapproval of Manet and similar artists was related to the idea of indecency behind "vulgar men" painting nude women.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;

=== General response ===
Though the peculiarity of the combination of one female nude with three clothed figures sparked mixed responses, the lack of interaction of the figures in addition to the lack of engagement by the nude woman provoked laughter instead of offense. Laughter as a response represses the sexual tension and makes the scene rather unthreatening to the viewer in the end.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;

==Commentary of Émile Zola==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. My God! What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! That has never been seen. And this belief is a gross error, for in the [[Louvre]] there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience.  Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Zola, ''Édouard Manet,'' 1867,  et lps 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.cahiers-naturalistes.com/Salons/01-01-67.html&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dzola%2Bon%2Bmanet%26start%3D10%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3Dpu9%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26channel%3Dsb%26biw%3D1799%26bih%3D840 Émile Zola, ''Édouard Manet,'' 1867, link to English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zola presents a fictionalised version of the painting and the controversy surrounding it in his novel ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' (''The Masterpiece'').

== Inspired works==
[[File:Monet dejeunersurlherbe.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (Monet)|Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'', 1865–1866, [[Musée d'Orsay]], [[Paris, France|Paris]].]]
[[File:James Tissot - La Partie carrée.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Tissot]], ''La Partie Carrée'', 1870]]
* In ''L'Oeuvre'', Émile Zola's novel about a painter, a work by his main character, Claude Lantier, exhibited in a fictional salon des refusés, resembles Manet's painting.
* [[Claude Monet]]'s own version of ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (Monet)|Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' from 1865–1866, was inspired by Manet's masterpiece.
* French painter [[James Tissot]], painted ''La Partie Carrée'', in 1870; arguably a tamer version without the nudity of ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe''.
* [[Paul Cézanne]] painted the same theme in his ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe'' (1876–1877), [[Musée de l'Orangerie]], Paris. It is not certain, however, that Cézanne was responsible for the title of the work, but it does incorporate many of the same elements of subject in the piece. For example, Cézanne’s clothed female subject poses similarly to the model of Manet in which her chin rests in her hand. The male figure, meant to resemble the painter himself, mimics the hand gesture of the man furthest right in Manet’s piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=Nancy|title="Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe as a Family Romance" Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of Cézanne's painting also bears resemblance to ''[[:File:Nicolas Poussin - Bacchanal - the Andrians - WGA18269.jpg|Bacchanal]]'' (between 1627 and 1628), by [[Nicolas Poussin]], whose works in the Louvre were periodically copied by Cézanne. It is possible that Cézanne's ''Déjeuner'' represents nothing more than the joyful memories of outings in the countryside around Aix-en-Provence, known especially from the testimony of a childhood friend of the painter, Émile Zola.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orangerie.fr/pages/page_id19113_u1l2.htm Paul Cézanne, ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe'' (1876–1877), Musée de l'Orangerie, Paris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029032121/http://www.musee-orangerie.fr/pages/page_id19113_u1l2.htm |date=2014-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Manet’s painting inspired [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] as he completed the largest concentration of art prompted by a single work during the 20th century, consisting of 27 paintings, 140 drawings, 3 linogravures and cardboard marquettes for sculpture carried out between 1949 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso: Challenging the past'' [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] exhibition book, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso also adopted some of Manet’s techniques involving exploitation of the nude in the foreground as evident in his work ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', 1907.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;
* [[Paul Gauguin]] may have been inspired by this piece in creating his 1896 work ''Where do we come from? Who are we? Where are we going?'', as there is a similarity of Manet’s depiction of the nude woman and Gauguin’s Tahitian woman.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;
* [[Max Ernst]] painted a parody version of this piece named ''Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbre'' in 1944. He inverts the painting, replaces the nude woman with a fish, and adds an 'r' to the title for comedic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/art/2002.55?collection_search_query=fish&amp;op=search&amp;form_build_id=form-LSCVdx4K6pNGdu3UeD8aED5T32uXqJtj4kV67Am_FPk&amp;form_id=clevelandart_collection_search_form&amp;f%5B0%5D=object_on_view:1&amp;c=1|title=Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbre {{!}} Cleveland Museum of Art|website=www.clevelandart.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The painting inspired the 1959 [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052765/ film] of the same name by [[Jean Renoir]].
* It was copied in the cover photo of the [[Bow Wow Wow]] [[LP record|LP]] ''[[See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!]]'', and the [[extended play|EP]] ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (Bow Wow Wow EP)|The Last of the Mohicans]]''. Controversy arose because the naked girl (lead singer [[Annabella Lwin]]) was only 14 at the time.  
* [[Alain Jacquet]] copied in 1964 the composition of Manet in his ''Déjeuner sur l'herbe''[http://collection.centrepompidou.fr/#/artworks?layout=mosaic&amp;page=0&amp;filters=authors:JACQUET+Alain%E2%86%B9JACQUET+Alain :], a serie of 95 serigraphies portraying the art critic [[Pierre Restany]] and the painter [[Mario Schifano]], one of which was left in the lobby of the [[hotel Chelsea]] in [[New York City]] for payment of his room.

A native of [[Paris]], Chauvin began her career performing on French radio and onstage in England.

While some films criticize armed conflicts in a general sense, others focus on acts within a specific war, such as the use of poison gas or the [[Genocide|genocidal]] killing of civilians (e.g., ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]'', 2004). Some [[anti-war]] films such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964) use [[parody]] and [[black comedy]] to [[satire|satirize]] wars and conflicts. An anti-war film's goal is to show the physical and psychological destruction warfare causes to the soldiers and to innocent civilians.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

This article describes the '''architecture''' of the '''Muisca'''. The [[Muisca people|Muisca]], inhabiting the central highlands of the [[Colombia]]n [[Andes]] ([[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] and the southwestern part of that the [[Bogotá savanna]]), were one of the four great civilizations of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V. p.226&lt;/ref&gt; Other than the three civilizations in present-day [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]]; the [[Aztec civilization|Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]] respectively, they did not construct grand [[Pre-Columbian architecture|architecture]] of solid materials. While specialising in [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]] and [[Muisca art|gold-working, cloths and ceramics]], their architecture was rather modest and made of non-permanent materials as wood and clay.

Evidence for the Muisca architecture relies on archaeological excavations performed since the mid 20th century. In recent years larger areas showing evidence of the Early Muisca architecture have been uncovered, the biggest of them in [[Soacha]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/descubrimiento-arqueologico-mas-grande-de-colombia/367219-3 El descubrimiento arqueológico más grande de Colombia] - [[Semana (Colombia)|Semana]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/bogota/aldea-premuisca-enreda-transmision-de-luz-bogota-articulo-432960 Aldea premuisca enreda transmisión de luz a Bogotá] - [[El Espectador]]&lt;/ref&gt; All of the original houses and temples have been destroyed by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] conquerors and replaced with [[colonial architecture]]. Reconstructions of some houses (''bohíos'') and the most important temple in the [[Muisca religion]]; the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Temple of the Sun]] in [[Sogamoso]], called Sugamuxi by the Muisca, have been built in the second half of the 20th century.

Important [[List of Muisca scholars|scholars]] who have contributed to the knowledge about the Muisca architecture are [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], who made the first contact with the Muisca, early 17th century [[friar]]s [[Pedro Simón]] and [[Juan de Castellanos]] later bishop [[Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita]] and modern [[archaeologist]]s [[Eliécer Silva Celis]], [[Sylvia M. Broadbent|Sylvia Broadbent]], [[Carl Henrik Langebaek]] and others.

== Background ==
The Altiplano Cundiboyacense, the high plateau in the Colombian Andes, has been inhabited for at least 12,400 years, with the earliest evidence in [[El Abra]], [[Tibitó]] and [[Tequendama]]. During this era, the [[paleoclimate]] and [[flora]] and [[fauna]] were different from today. It was the end of the [[Pleistocene]], when [[stadial]]s and [[interstadial]]s intercalated and the [[glacier]]s in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] were advancing and retreating. When the first [[hunter-gatherer]]s arrived from the north (the [[Caribbean]] coast and earlier from [[Central America]]), they encountered still the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] on the highlands; ''[[Cuvieronius]]'', ''[[Stegomastodon]]'', ''[[Haplomastodon]]'' and ''[[Equus andium]]'' in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Correal Urrego, 1990, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time and age, as is evidenced in [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations at various sites on the Altiplano, the people lived in caves and rock shelters. The [[Muisca Confederation#Prehistory|prehistorical]] period was followed by the [[Herrera Period]], commonly dated at 800 BCE to 800 CE. It was in this era that the agricultural advancement, that started in the latest [[Andean preceramic|preceramic]] times, caused a change towards population of the plains, away from the caves and rock shelters.&lt;ref&gt;Correal Urrego, 1990, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; This also led to an increase in population which was modest in the early Herrera Period and more pronounced towards the end of it; the start of the Muisca Period at around 800 CE. Further population growth and a more stratified society is observed in archaeological analysis of the Late Muisca Period, from 1200 CE onwards. The first contact with the Muisca happened in 1537 by the troops of [[conquistador]] and explorer [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] and his brother [[Hernán Pérez de Quesada|Hernán]].

== Muisca architecture ==
=== Houses and settlements ===
The houses of the Muisca, called ''bohíos'' or ''malokas'', were circular structures made of poles of wood and walls of clay, with a conical reed roof. A long beam of wood supported the roof in the centre of the round structure and was attached to the wooden poles. The interior of the roof was decorated with cloths with thin strokes of different colours. On the floor fine straw was placed.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.203&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''bohíos'', probably those of the ''[[cacique]]s'' had [[ceramic]] floors, as evidenced by findings in [[Mosquera, Cundinamarca|Mosquera]]. This was atypical for the Muisca houses.&lt;ref&gt;Cardale de Schrimpff, 1985, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Spanish chroniclers have reported "great populations" of the Muisca territories,&lt;ref&gt;Efraín Sánchez, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; the people lived in small settlements, described by the Spanish conquerors as "dispersed homesteads". As the Maya people, the Muisca related the smaller settlements with their effective [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 1993, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Houses on the Bogotá savanna were built on slightly elevated areas to prevent them from floodings of the various rivers, humedales and swamps, characteristic of the area.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, 1974, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;
Each community had their own farmlands and hunting grounds surrounding their houses. The houses were constructed around a central square with the house of the ''cacique'' in the centre. Two or more "gates" in the ''cercado'' (enclosure) gave access to the village.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek, 1995a, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;
The exact number of houses in the villages remains unclear and requires more archaeological work. De Quesada described villages of 10 up to 100 houses. 
The Late Muisca Period, commonly defined as 1200-1537, is characterised by denser population and larger communities, especially in [[Suba (Bogotá)|Suba]] and [[Cota, Cundinamarca|Cota]] with more dispersed housing in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in the [[Kennedy (Bogotá)|Las Delicias]] neighbourhood of Bogotá, on an alluvial terrace of the [[Tunjuelito River]] in 1990, exposed six circular structures of {{convert|4.6|m|ft}} in diameter, which is slightly smaller than living spaces found in other areas, e.g. in [[Facatativá]] ({{convert|5|m|ft}}).&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation of these houses has been dated from the start of the Muisca Period until the colonial period. The living space was occupied in two stages, starting from 950 BCE, followed by a next phase dated at 750 BCE. The [[carbon dating|dating has been done based on carbon]], taken from the floors of the area. Ceramics, animal bones, swindles, seeds and jewellery has been found in this location too.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologist [[Eliécer Silva Celis|Silva Celis]] uncovered in 1943 housing structures in Soacha with four different temporal levels with indications of population in the form of ash deposits from fires and animal bones.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Gallo, 2010, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Various scholars agree that the housing of the Muisca was egalitarian; little differentiation between the living spaces of the ''caciques'' and the lower-class people has been found, especially in Soacha.&lt;ref name=Kruschek_p180&gt;Kruschek, 2003, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henderson_p149&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been described -by [[Pedro Simón]] among others- that at the entrance posts of the houses of the ''caciques'' [[Muisca religion#Human sacrifices|human sacrifice remains]] were hanging and the posts smeared with blood from the victims, who were regarded as sacred when they were young boys (''moxas'') or captured from neighbouring indigenous groups. Archaeological evidence from Mosquera supported this thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roads ===
The roads of the Muisca people were unpaved, which makes it hard to identify them in archaeological excavations. Some of the roads were trade routes, with the eastern neighbours ([[Orinoquía Region|Llanos Orientales]]), in the north with the [[Guane people]] and in the west with the Panche and Muzo, others were sacred routes. Examples of holy roads, used for pilgrimages, were found in [[Guasca]] and [[Siecha Lakes|Siecha]]. Routes communicating Muisca territories with [[cotton]] producing areas ran through [[Somondoco]] and [[Súnuba]]. The roads crossing the mountains surrounding the Altiplano were narrow, making it more difficult for the Spanish conquistadores to cross them, especially with horses. Once they reached the open terrains of the Bogotá savanna, movement became easier.&lt;ref&gt;Langebaek, 1995b, Ch.1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temples ===
The Muisca, as part of their [[Muisca religion|religion]], built various temples throughout their territories. The most sacred were the Sun Temple in Sugamuxi and the [[Moon Temple (Chía)|Moon Temple]] in [[Chía, Cundinamarca|Chía]]. The Sun Temple was built to honour [[Sué]], the Sun god of the Muisca, and the Moon Temple was honouring his wife, [[Chía (goddess)|Chía]]. Also notable was the [[Goranchacha Temple]], according to [[Muisca mythology|Muisca myths]] built by [[Goranchacha]]. On one of the islands in [[Lake Fúquene]] there had been a temple with grand decoration and 100 priests, as described by De Piedrahita.&lt;ref name=Casilimas_p135&gt;Casilimas, 1987, p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedro Simón noted that the temples were built with wood from the ''[[Guaiacum officinale|guayacán]]'' tree, to make them last long.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson &amp; Ostler, 2005, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

According to De Piedrahita, the ''moxas'' were raised in the temples to make them as sacred as possible for when they would be sacrificed, which meant a great honour to the families who donated the young boys.&lt;ref name=Casilimas_p135/&gt;

=== Other structures ===
Other structures of the Muisca were mostly religious in character. Apart from their celebrations at natural areas, such as [[Lake Guatavita]], [[Lake Iguaque]], [[Lake Tota]], [[Lake Fúquene]], [[Lake Suesca]] and the [[Siecha Lakes]], the Muisca constructed some places where religious ceremonies were held, such as the [[Cojines del Zaque]] and the [[Hunzahúa Well]], both in [[Tunja|Hunza]], present-day Tunja.

As an exception to the wood-and-clay structures of the houses and temples of the Muisca people, allegedly one of their structures had been made of stone; the [[Cajicá#History|fortress of Cajicá]], just north of present-day Bogotá. The structure is described with walls of {{convert|80|cm|in}} thick and {{convert|4|m|ft}} high, but modern scientists have cast doubt on the structure and if it existed in the [[pre-Columbian era]].&lt;ref&gt;Román, 2008, p.288&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-conquest ==
The first construction of post-conquest architecture took place shortly after De Quesada had conquered the city of Bacatá, later called Santafe and known as the capital Bogotá in modern age. At the location of present-day [[Teusaquillo]], twelve houses and a church in the style of the Muisca -with wood and clay- had been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Salcedo, 2011, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a general policy of the Spanish, eased by the non-permanent architecture of the Muisca, that existing structures would be taken down and replaced by Spanish colonial architecture.

=== Reconstructions ===
Reconstructions of Muisca ''bohíos'' and the most important temple of Sogamoso, are displayed in the [[Archaeology Museum, Sogamoso|Archaeology Museum]] in Sogamoso. This work has been done in the early stage of archaeological research on the Altiplano, in the 1940s. [[Eliécer Silva Celis]] was the architect and archaeologist involved in the reconstructions.

Archaeological work has been hindered by the constant expansion of the capital Bogotá in which vicinity and territory many ancient structures were built. An archaeological expedition of 2002 proved that within months the previously unoccupied [[List of Muisca and pre-Muisca sites|archaeological site]] was already covered with construction.&lt;ref&gt;Kruschek, 2003, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nabil Shaban''' (born 12 February 1953&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/589316 Profile], screenonline.org.uk; retrieved 1 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a Jordanian-British actor and writer. He founded [[Graeae Theatre Company|The Graeae]]—a theatre group which promotes performers with [[disability|disabilities]].

==Early years and career==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
Shaban was born in [[Amman]], Jordan. He studied at the [[University of Surrey]] in the late 1970s and contributed to the Students' Union newspaper "Bare Facts". In 1997, Shaban was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the university for services in the promotion of Disability Arts.

One of his most memorable television roles was that of the reptilian alien [[Sil (Doctor Who)|Sil]] in the [[BBC]] science fiction television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. Shaban played Sil in two serials: ''[[Vengeance on Varos]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mindwarp]]'' (1986), and created Sil's laugh. He reprised the role in the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio dramas ''[[Mission to Magnus]]'' (2009) and ''[[Antidote to Oblivion]]'' (2013), both again written by [[Philip Martin (screenwriter)|Philip Martin]].

He has appeared in several films, including ''Born of Fire'' (1983), ''[[City of Joy]]'' (1992), Derek Jarman's ''[[Wittgenstein (film)|Wittgenstein]]'' (1993), ''Gaias børn'' (1998), and ''[[Children of Men]]'' (2006), and has also worked as part of the [[Crass Collective]]. In 2011, he played the Roman emperor [[Constantius II]] at the National Theatre in Ibsen's ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]''.

In 2003 he made a TV documentary titled ''The Strangest Viking'' (part of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Secret History (TV series)|Secret History]]'' series), in which Shaban explored the possibility that Viking chieftain [[Ivar the Boneless]] may have had [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], the same condition he himself has. Shaban has also published a trilogy of Ivar the Boneless screenplays on Kindle, representing the Viking chieftain as a disabled Danish prince with brittle bones and unable to walk.

Shaban was nominated Best Actor in Scottish theatre in 2005, by the Critics' Awards for Theatre in Scotland (CATS), for his role as [[Mack the Knife]] in [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera|Threepenny Opera]]'', a [[Theatre Workshop Scotland|Theatre Workshop (Edinburgh)]] production. Shaban lost out to rival nominee [[David Tennant]], who was about to become the new [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who]].

Shaban's play ''The First To Go'' premièred in May 2008, produced by Edinburgh's Benchtours Theatre Company in association with Sirius Pictures. It opened at the [[Royal Lyceum Theatre|Lyceum Theatre]] in Edinburgh on 23 May and toured to the [[Tron Theatre]], Glasgow; the [[Byre Theatre]], St Andrews and [[Lawrence Batley Theatre]], Huddersfield.

'''Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA)'''  ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Nasjonal digital læringsarena'') is a joint [[Counties of Norway|county]] enterprise offering open [[digital learning assets]] for [[Upper secondary school (Norway)|upper secondary education]]. In addition to being a compilation of [[Open educational resources|open educational resources (OER)]], NDLA provides a range of other online tools for sharing and cooperation. The legal liability for the joint county programme is carried by [[Hordaland County Municipality|Hordaland County Council]].

NDLA does not take on its own employees, but manages co-workers within the county resource system, as well as co-workers from [[private sector]].
Core activities are organised in teams: Subject material development, technical development, applications management, content management, NDLA interactive, and desk support.&lt;ref&gt;From Chapter 2 in NDLAs Annual Report for 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2006 The [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]] allocated NOK 50 mill for the development of digital learning resources for subjects in secondary education. Among the targets was the intention to enhance the access to and use of digital learning resources in secondary education, and increase the volume and the variety of such resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/kd/dok/andre/brev/utvalgte_brev/2006/digitale-laremidler-i-videregaende-oppla.html?id=91754 Letter from the Ministry of Education dated 19.06.2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Increased volume and diversity were seen as significant conditions for the introduction of free learning material in upper secondary education. The incentive was an amendment imposing the counties to provide free educational material, in print as well as digital, including digital hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/1998-07-17-61#KAPITTEL_3 Norwegian Education Act § 3-1. The right to upper secondary education for youth]&lt;/ref&gt;

20 September 2006 the county chief executives of education agreed to establish a joint project to develop digital subject material for all subjects in secondary education. The project was named Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA).&lt;ref&gt;"Digitale læremiddel i vidaregåande opplæring - Nasjonal digital læringsarena", political issue with case number 200702708-9 in Hordaland County Council&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary project work started early 2007; all counties except Oslo were parts of the collaboration. The first year the project was fully funded by the Ministry of Education and Research, and on 26 September Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg officially opened Norwegian Digital Learning Arena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hordaland.no/Aktuelt/Arkiv-nyhende/2007/September/Nasjonal-digital-laringsarena-opna-av-statsminister-Stoltenberg/ Norwegian Digital Learning Arena opened by PM Jens Stoltenberg. (From the web site of Hordaland County.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605052740/http://www.hordaland.no/Aktuelt/Arkiv-nyhende/2007/September/Nasjonal-digital-laringsarena-opna-av-statsminister-Stoltenberg/ |date=5 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic year 2008–2009 subject material for Norwegian, natural science, and health and social care, first year course, was published.

The 18 participating counties took over the further funding of the project, and for the academic year 2009–2010 digital subject material was provided for 17 curricula and more than 30 subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;Many curricula cover more than one subject; it is for example normal that a curriculum for a vocational syllabus is split into three or four different subject areas. Curricula for Norwegian, mathematics, and English also cover more than one subject.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent increases by the year and by school start in 2014 subject material covering approximately 40 curricula and 60 subject areas within upper secondary education is available.

In 2013 [[Akershus]] County decided to withdraw from the project, however, the county resumed its participation from January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akershus.no/file/ec32575da10d58b6582107d0d4343d8c/Sakskart%202%20til%20fylkestinget%2023.09.13.pdf Agenda from the Akershus County Assembly of 23 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of visits to the digital learning resources on ndla.no has been rising since the start of the project. Based on ratings by [[Google Analytics]] the figures are:&lt;ref&gt;Figures of ratings quoted from [http://om.ndla.no/brukerstatistikk/ NDLA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2010: 1 431 017
* 2011: 2 876 541
* 2012: 4 799 181
* 2013: 7 022 812
* 2014: 8 200 000
* 2015 10 000 000
* 2016: 11 800 000
* 2017: 12 400 000 

[[Oslo]] County does not take part in the NDLA project, but is the county with most visits and use of the resources on ndla.no. In 2013 there were 1 139 129 visits from Oslo.

==Technology==
NDLA is developed in the publishing system [[Drupal]] 6. The solution was initially created by the developing group Utdanning.no,&lt;ref&gt;[https://kgv.doffin.no/app/docmgmt/downloadPublicDocument.asp?DVID=292751&amp;FMT=1&amp;AT=15&amp;ID=96478 Basis of qualification from Doffin for acquisition of securing, running, and storage of a digital learning platform for NDLA. ]&lt;/ref&gt; but further development and operation now lies with the Cerpus group. The core code of the system is [[open source software]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://bitbucket.org/ndla/profile/repositories The ndla open source project]&lt;/ref&gt; open for anyone aiming to develop digital learning resources. In 2018 NDLA will relaunch on a [https://github.com/ndlano new technological platform]. 

==Prizes and Nominations==
In 2011 NDLA was nominated for [[European Public Service Award]] (EPSA).&lt;ref&gt;Theme 1 - Nominees: [http://www.epsa2013.eu/en/content/show/&amp;tid=160 European Public Service Award i 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; The prize is awarded annually within the EU/EEC area, the ambition is to develop and improve solutions within public and civil administration. NDLA was candidate for the prize with the entry: NDLA Innovation in Acquisition, Development and Distribution of Digital Learning Resources. A total of 274 initiatives were evaluated, and 15 candidates were shortlisted for the prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://om.ndla.no/pressemelding-norsk-metode-til-topps-i-europa Press release: Norwegian Way on Top in Europe (from om.ndla.no)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727043551/http://om.ndla.no/pressemelding-norsk-metode-til-topps-i-europa |date=27 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


In 2014 NDLA won the [[Boldic Award]] for its open and innovative web repository at ndla.no.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boldic.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Boldic_Award_2014_diplom1_original_us_final1.pdf BOLDIC AWARD 2014, Stockholm 23 October 2014, The Boldic Award Jury 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; In the jury statement, it was pointed out that NDLA's project strategy and solutions can be scalable across the Nordic and Baltic countries, and that NDLA provides a unique way of working together to promote distance learning and ICT-supported flexible lifelong learning.


In 2017 NDLA won the [http://www.oeconsortium.org/projects/open-education-awards-for-excellence/2017-oe-award-winners-oer-categories/ Open Educational Resources Awards for best OER Site].

==External evaluations==
The NDLA learning resources are continually evaluated by independent third parties. An external users’ study from 2013 revealed that NDLA was mostly used as supplement to a traditional textbook, and the use was largely managed by the teacher. Students pointed out e-lectures and differentiated tasks as most useful. Both teachers and students emphasized the value of the possibility to differentiate material and tasks designed for students with varying learning capability.&lt;ref&gt;Athenae AS [http://om.ndla.no/system/files/Brukerundersøkelse%20NDLA%202013.pdf Evaluation of NDLA -- User Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022222111/http://om.ndla.no/system/files/Brukerunders%C3%B8kelse%20NDLA%202013.pdf |date=22 October 2013 }}, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procurement and Production==
By publicly inviting tenders NDLA searches the market for digital learning resources to cover the competence aims of the different subject areas. NDLA asks for production services, developing groups of digital learning material, for either parts of, or prospective total solutions for a complete curriculum.

The responsibility for the editorial work, organising, meta-tagging, and putting together the material in the respective subject areas lies with competent editing groups recruited from upper secondary schools in the counties. The contents of each site are quality controlled by academy and university expertise, or otherwise specialists in that particular field. All the core material is published in the two forms of Norwegian.

When the demand is not met by the supply, the editing groups will produce their own material. The publishing companies are invited to collaborate in every round of purchase, and are free to make an offer of their material that will benefit their interests.

==Funding==
The basic income of NDLA rests on a joint contribution from the part-taking counties, of NOK 400, - per student, which constitutes an annual income of estimated NOK 64 mill. In 2013 this figure was lower due to Akershus’ leaving the project.&lt;ref&gt;From chapter 7 in NDLA’s annual report 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 66% of NDLA’s net expenses in 2013 were spent on purchase in the market.&lt;ref&gt;From chapter 8 in NDLA’s annual report 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 NDLA was indicted by the [[Norwegian Publishers' Association]] before the [[European System of Financial Supervisors|European Surveillance Authority]] (ESA). The publishers claimed that the state funding of more than NOK 150 mill did not comply with the international regulation of financial state support, and represented an obstacle to the establishing of a free market for digital learning resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forleggerforeningen.no/filemanager/download_file/file/506285.pdf/rsberetning%202010.pdf Annual Report from Norwegian Publishers' Association 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105033/http://www.forleggerforeningen.no/filemanager/download_file/file/506285.pdf/rsberetning%202010.pdf |date=20 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The indictment was initially rejected by the [[EFTA Surveillance Authority]] on 12 October 2011,&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2011-10-12: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/1535 State aid: Norwegian support to provider of digital learning material cleared] 12.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eftasurv.int/media/decisions/311-11-COL.pdf EFTA Surveillance Authority decision] 2011-10-12&lt;/ref&gt; but in December 2012 the dismissal was set aside by the EFTA Court after an appeal from the Publishers’ Association. In March 2013 the [[EFTA Court]] announced a formal investigation of the funding of NDLA,&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2013-03-27: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/1905 State Aid: Investigation opened into funding of Norwegian provider of digital learning material]&lt;/ref&gt; and ESA reopened the case. After a close examination ESA reached the same conclusion; the funding of NDLA is in compliance with the rules of state funding.&lt;ref&gt;EFTA Surveillance Authority Press Release 2014-06-26: [http://www.eftasurv.int/press--publications/press-releases/state-aid/nr/2278 State aid: Norwegian support to the provider of digital learning material does not involve state aid]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rain, Steam and Speed – The Great Western Railway''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the 19th-century British painter [[J. M. W. Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Angel in the Sun: Turner's vision of history |author= Gerald E. Finley|year= 1999|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=0-7735-1747-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0773517472&amp;id=uxroHjm2QAIC&amp;pg=RA5-PA138&amp;lpg=RA5-PA138&amp;ots=ZKjqEtOys-&amp;dq=%22Rain,+Steam+and+Speed+-+The+Great+Western+Railway%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=aC5UG5cMlYhexrkPHMZZGTTmpCg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1844, though it may have been painted earlier.{{efn-lr|The Great Western began running trains from 1838.}} It is now in the collection of the [[National Gallery]], London.

The [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) was one of a number of private British railway companies created to develop the new means of transport. The location of the painting is widely accepted as [[Maidenhead Railway Bridge]], across the River Thames between Taplow and Maidenhead. The view is looking east towards London. The bridge was designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] and completed in 1838. A hare runs along the track in the bottom right of the painting, possibly symbolising speed itself.&lt;ref&gt;Gage, John.

New York, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Some think this is a reference to the limits of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Hanning, Barbara. (2010) ''Concise History of Western Music''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe the animal is running in fear of the new machinery and Turner meant to hint at the danger of man's new technology destroying the inherent sublime elements of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Meslay, Olivier.

The '''''Regina Vasorum''''' or '''Queen of Vases''' is a 4th-century BC [[hydria]] from [[Cumae]] depicting [[Eleusinian Mysteries|Eleusinian]] divinities with [[Gilding|gilded]] flesh in [[polychrome]] [[relief]].

==Plot==
Nikhil "Nick" Arora ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) and Ambar "Amby" Malhotra ([[Preity Zinta]]) are two progressive, young Indians who have left India to live in [[Melbourne]], Australia. Nick was originally sent abroad to become an architect, but his real passion is cooking. After graduating, he designs a restaurant, which he ultimately takes over and becomes the head chef. His job allows him to have a laid-back lifestyle and get up late in the morning, both aspects that he values very much. While living at home in [[Bangalore]], Ambar had rejected more than a dozen marriage proposals. Her parents suspected that she did not want to get married, but she denied this. She arrived in Australia for a one-year foreign exchange program and decided to stay and become a surgeon. After hearing this, her parents disowned her. To pay for her education, she works as a R.J. at a local radio station, 'Salaam Namaste'.

Nick is scheduled to do an interview for Salaam Namaste, but he oversleeps and irritated Ambar insults him on the air. Another interview is arranged but Nick oversleeps again and he is, once again, insulted by Ambar for being late. 

Nick is the caterer for a wedding attended by Ambar. His best friend Ranjan (Ron) ([[Arshad Warsi]]) falls in love with Ambar's best friend Cathy ([[Tania Zaetta]]) at the wedding. Nick also feels a connection with Ambar, although they have no idea who the other really is. Nick tells Ambar he is an architect and Amber tells him that she is a Student of Medicine. Ron and Cathy hastily marry the next day and Nick and Ambar discover each other's true identities. Nick gives the interview on Salaam Namaste, where he states, publicly, that he loves Ambar. Nick and Ambar become friends and eventually move in together and fall in love. They both [[Sexual intercourse|make love]]. A few months later, Ambar discovers she is pregnant, and they decide to end the pregnancy. Nick takes her to get an abortion, but she cannot go through with it. The pair fight and then break up.

Over the next five months, they have several comical disagreements. Nick finds a restaurant to buy, but the loan is disapproved as he cannot afford the down payment, since he spent all his money on the house he shares with Ambar. This results in another argument during which the baby kicks for the first time and Nick realises he still loves Ambar. Ambar asks Nick to take a blood test, because she has [[thalassemia]] minor, and if he has the disease too then there will be complications. At the hospital, the couple discovers that Ambar is carrying twins. On the way home, Nick realises that he had left Ambar alone through the whole pregnancy, when she needed him the most. He decides to commit to Ambar and his unborn children, and goes to buy an engagement ring. At the store, he sees Ambar trying on rings with her friend, Jignesh ([[Jugal Hansraj]]). Nick believes that Ambar is marrying Jignesh and is devastated. In a drunken haze, he takes home a drunk girl from the bar named Stella. The next morning, an annoyed Stella tells Nick that all he did the previous night was cry over Ambar. Nick is greatly relieved, but Ambar sees Stella in the bedroom and assumes that they have slept together, and she leaves in a rage. Nick discovers that Ambar was trying on rings for Jignesh's girlfriend, Tina. He searches for Ambar with the help of many devoted Salaam Namaste listeners. He finds her and apologises, but Ambar's water breaks, and they rush to the hospital.

At the hospital, Ron is there with Cathy, who's giving birth as well, and the nurse turns out to be Stella. She tells Ambar that Nick didn't do anything the previous night and is in love with Ambar, who finally realises Nick's love for her. They then meet the [[obstetrician]] Dr. Vijay ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]), who turns out to be a very comical and incompetent doctor, but manages to deliver the children. Ambar gives birth to twins and Nick proposes to her to which she joyously agrees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1119">'''Teatro Sant' Apollinare''' was an Italian public opera house established in 1651 in [[Venice]] in what is today Petriana Court. The Sant 'Apollinare was established in a residential building and equipped with advanced [[stage machinery]] intended to allow for spectacular stage shows. It was managed in 1651 by impessario and librettist [[Giovanni Faustini]], who died during the first run of his opera ''[[La Calisto]]'' there. After his death, his brother [[Marco Faustini]] took over management of the theater. It was dismantled in 1661 and the rooms returned to residential use.

'''''The Paradoxes of the Infinite''''' (German title: ''Paradoxien des Unendlichen'') is a mathematical work by [[Bernard Bolzano]] on the theory of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]]. It was published by a friend and student, [[František Přihonský]], in 1851, three years after Bolzano's death. The work contained many interesting results in [[set theory]]. Bolzano expanded on the theme of [[Galileo's paradox]], giving more examples of correspondences between the elements of an infinite set and [[proper subset]]s of infinite sets. In the work he also explained the term ''Menge'', rendered in English as "set", which he had coined and used in several works since the 1830s.

'''''Very Short Introductions''''' ('''''VSI''''') are a [[book series]] published by the [[Oxford University Press]] (OUP). The books are concise introductions to particular subjects, intended for a general audience but written by experts. Most are under 200 pages long. While authors may present personal viewpoints, the books are meant to be "balanced and complete" as well as thought provoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/series/VeryShortIntroductions/|title=Very Short Introductions|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series began in 1995, and by April 2018 there were 607 titles, published or announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/v/very-short-introductions-vsi/|title=Very Short Introductions – General Series|publisher=Oxford University Press (UK)|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/series/VeryShortIntroductions/ |title=Very Short Introductions |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books have been commercially successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/academic/series/general/vsi/9780199590599.do?sortby=pubDateAscend&amp;page=32&amp;thumbby=10&amp;thumbby_crawl=10 |title=Languages: A Very Short Introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press (UK) |accessdate=2011-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224101632/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/academic/series/general/vsi/9780199590599.do?sortby=pubDateAscend&amp;page=32&amp;thumbby=10&amp;thumbby_crawl=10 |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been published in more than 25 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glendinning|first=Simon|title=Derrida: A Very Short Introduction|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-280345-0|page=ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions can subscribe to an online service to allow their users to read the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veryshortintroductions.com/ |title=Very Short Introductions |publisher=Oxford University Press (UK) |accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the books have been written specifically for the series, but around 60 were recycled from earlier OUP publications: several had been in OUP's ''[[Past Masters (book series)|Past Masters]]'' series, and numbers 17–24 used chapters from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain'' (1984).

The '''Warrior relief of Efrenk''' is a [[rock relief]] from the Greco-Roman period, probably the 2nd century AD, located by the Lamos river (modern day [[Limonlu Çayı|Limonlu]]) in [[Cilicia]], southern [[Turkey]].

== Location ==
[[File:Efrenk Krieger Relief.jpg|thumb|vertical|Warrior relief]]
The relief is about two kilometres north of [[Sömek, Silifke|Sömek]] in the [[Silifke]] district of [[Mersin Province]], about 30 km northeast of the city of Silifke and 20 km north of [[Kızkalesi]], the ancient [[Korykos]]. It is carved into a northwest-facing cliff-face beside a steep path leading down to the Lamos. A ford at this spot connected the ancient settlement of Efrenk on the hill south of the relief with Veyselli on the other side of the Lamos. The route continued on to the settlement at the mouth of the Lamos, [[Antiochia Lamotis]] (now [[Limonlu, Mersin|Limonlu]]). After passing the relief, the route led south past Sömek towards [[Canbazlı]] and [[Olba (ancient city)|Olba]], as well as Korykos and [[Elaiussa Sebaste]] on the Mediterranean coast. The river Lamos is often treated as the border between the ancient regions of Rough Cilicia (''Kilikia Tracheia'') in the west and Flat Cilicia (''Kilikia Pedias'') in the east.

The [[Athena relief of Sömek]] is roughly 600 m to the southeast.

== Description ==
[[File:Efrenk Krieger Schrift.jpg|thumb|vertical|inscription]]
The relief is carved into a vertical cliff-face about 5 m above street level. It is 1.9 m high and depicts a warrior, surrounded by a [[naiskos]]. The legs are badly damaged; the right leg supports his weight, while the left leg hangs free. His raised right arm holds up a spear. On his left side he wears a sword, with his left hand on the grip. He is dressed in a short, belted [[chiton]], with clearly carved drapery. There are traces of white paint on the relief in several spaces - between the head and the right arm, for instance, there are traces of red paint. Paint very rarely survives on Cilician cliff reliefs.

On the left [[pilaster]] there is an inscription at about chest height, which has been resolved as an 8 line inscription:
{{columns
| col1 = {{quote|{{lang-grc|῾Ός δ’ ἂν βά-&lt;br&gt;
λη ἤ ἀ[φ]αι-&lt;br&gt;
ρήση τὸ [ἡ-]&lt;br&gt;
ρῶιον, βά-&lt;br&gt;
λοι αύτ[ον]&lt;br&gt;
ὁ ῾Ήλιος&lt;br&gt;
καὶ ἡ Σελή-&lt;br&gt;
ν[η].}}}}
| col2 = {{quote|{{lang-en|May [[Helios]] and [[Selene]] attack anyone who attacks or diminishes the Heroon.}}}}
}}
[[Josef Keil]] and [[Adolf Wilhelm (philologist)|Adolf Wilhelm]] report the illegible traces of an "actual funerary inscription in the background on the left and right sides of the figure's head." The letter forms date the inscription to the middle of the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], while similarities in posture and clothing led [[Serra Durugönül]] to date the relief to the second century AD when she studied the Cilician cliff reliefs in the 1980s.

== Research history ==
The first short description (with an incomplete reading of the inscription) was published by Edward L. Hicks in 1891 in his ''Inscriptions from Western Cilicia''. The ancient historians Keil and Wilhelm travelled Cilicia in 1891 and 1925, publishing an account in 1931, ''Denkmäler aus dem Rauhen Kilikien'' (Monuments of Rough Cilicia), in which the relief of Efrenk is described with a fuller reading of the inscription. In 1989 Serra Durugönül completed a dissertation, ''Die Felsreliefs im Rauhen Kilikien'' (The Cliff-reliefs of Rough Cilicia), which also discusses the warrior relief.

In [[colorimetry]], '''whiteness''' is the degree to which a surface is white. An example of its use might be to quantitatively compare two pieces of paper which appear white viewed individually, but not when juxtaposed.

The [[International Commission on Illumination]] describes it in the following terms:

{{quote|To promote uniformity of practice in the evaluation of whiteness of surface colors, it
is recommended that the formulæ for whiteness, W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or W&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, and for [[tint]], T&lt;sub&gt;w,2&lt;/sub&gt; or T&lt;sub&gt;w,10&lt;/sub&gt;, given below, be used for comparisons of the whiteness of samples evaluated for CIE [[standard illuminant]] [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]]. The application of the formulae is restricted to samples that are called "white" commercially, that do not differ much in color and fluorescence, and that are measured on the same instrument at nearly the same time. Within these restrictions, the formulæ provide relative, but not absolute, evaluations of whiteness, that are adequate for commercial use, when employing measuring instruments having suitable modern and commercially available facilities.|[http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/15-2004.html CIE Publication 15:2004]}}

==Calculation==
&lt;math&gt;W_2=Y_2+800(x_{n,2}-x_2)+1700(y_{n,2}-y_2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;W_{10}=Y_{10}+800(x_{n,10}-x_{10})+1700(y_{n,10}-y_{10})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_{w,2}=1000(x_{n,2}-x_2)-650(y_{n,2}-y_2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_{w,10}=900(x_{n,10}-x_{10})-650(y_{n,10}-y_{10})&lt;/math&gt;

where

* Y is the Y [[tristimulus value]] ([[relative luminance]]),
* (x,y) is the [[chromaticity coordinate]] in the [[CIE 1931 color space]]
* (x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) is the chromaticity coordinate of the [[diffuser (optics)#Perfect reflecting diffuser|perfect diffuser]] (reference white)

The numbers in the subscript indicate the observer: two for the CIE 1931 [[standard observer]] and ten for the CIE 1964 standard observer.

===Notes===
* W increases with whiteness, reaching 100 for the perfect diffuser.
* The tint is green for positive T and red for negative T.
* Equal differences in W may not appear equally different.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2434">The '''Yamaha Music Foundation''' is an organization established in 1966 by the authority of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]] for the purpose of promoting [[music education]] and music popularization. It continued a program of music classes begun by [[Yamaha Corporation]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Yamaha Music Foundation|url=http://www.yamaha-mf.or.jp/english/about/history.html|publisher=Yamaha Music Foundation|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its unique, systematic teaching method and [[Teacher education|teacher training]] programs are highly valued in [[Japan]] and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =Music School Opened In Lexington, MA (Yamaha) | newspaper =Music Trades| pages = | year = | date =June 1, 2006 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-147218120.html| archiveurl = | archivedate = | accessdate =November 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Yamaha Grade Examination System'' has been developed to enable students and teachers to ensure their own progress and thereby obtain [[self-confidence]] in their own music studies.  The Yamaha Grade Examination System consists of nine grades, Grade 9 to Grade 1. The [[Test (assessment)|examination]] evaluates the performing ability of the music lovers in general; the performing ability and the musical knowledge and techniques required for the instructors of the fundamentals stage; and also the performing competence of the [[Music artist (occupation)|professional musicians]].

The foundation is known for its organizing of the [[World Popular Song Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Egluchi | first =Hideo | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =Tokyo World Fest Draws 40 Songs; 6 Entered By Japan | newspaper =Billboard Magazine| pages =64 | year = | date =November 10, 1973 | url = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | accessdate =November 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which it organized from 1970 until 1989.
