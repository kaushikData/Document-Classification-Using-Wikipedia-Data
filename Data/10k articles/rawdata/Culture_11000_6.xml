'''''A Monstrous Regiment of Women''''' is the second book in the [[Mary Russell (fictional)|Mary Russell]] series of mystery novels by [[Laurie R. King]].

The title is taken from a work by [[John Knox]], published in 1558, ''[[The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regimen of Women]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.theroseandthornezine.com/Profile/laurieking.html |first=Mary Ann |last=Savage |title=Laurie R. King: an interview |journal=The Rose &amp; the Thorn  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox used the word regimen in an archaic sense to mean government or régime, and his book was written against the female sovereigns of his day, particularly [[Mary I of England]] and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].

==Plot summary==

In the winter of 1920, Mary Russell is on the cusp of turning 21 and lives a double life of [[Oxford University]] theological scholar as well as a consulting detective and partner of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. After events in [[The Beekeeper's Apprentice]], both Holmes and Russell are aware that their relationship and partnership has changed, perhaps romantically, but neither is eager to broach the subject.

A chance encounter unites Russell with Veronica Beaconsfield, an old Oxford acquaintance who is worried about her former fiancé, Miles Fitzwarren, a returned soldier and drug addict. Veronica introduces Russell to the well-financed New Temple in God and its leader, the enigmatic, charismatic Margery Childe, who preaches empowerment of women. Russell believes Margery to be a mystic and begins tutoring Margery in theology and reading Scripture, integrating into their lessons her own current academic work on feminism and [[Judaism]]. Russell also witnesses what she believes to be a true miracle, in which Margery is healed of serious physical wounds through prayer. Meanwhile, Holmes takes on Miles’s rehabilitation partially as a favor to Russell.

When an attempt is made on Veronica’s life, Holmes and Russell discover a mysterious pattern of deaths where fairly wealthy women have left large bequests to the Temple. Coming into her inheritance at age 21, Russell takes on the role of a young heiress to insinuate herself into the Temple’s leadership. While learning more about the Temple’s operations, Russell also fends off an attacker who threatens Margery.

En route back to Oxford, Russell is kidnapped by a man whom she identifies from descriptions of Margery’s husband, Claude. He keeps Russell prisoner and injects her with regular doses of [[heroin]]. Against the effects of the drug and solitary confinement, Russell struggles to retain her identity and will to survive, and in the face of possible death, contemplates her love for Holmes. Nine days later, she is rescued by Holmes, who also helps her overcome her reliance on the drug.

Undeterred by her ordeal, Russell breaks into Margery’s safe but finds no evidence indicating Margery’s complicity in the deaths. The next morning, Holmes and Russell follow Margery, who has gone to confront Claude, disturbed by his actions concerning Mary. In the ensuing chase and fight, Margery is wounded, Claude is killed, and Holmes narrowly survives. The near-death experience pushes both Holmes and Russell to admit their passion for one another. In the ensuing trial, Margery is acquitted of blame, but voluntarily exiles herself from England. Veronica and a recovered Miles finally marry, as do Holmes and Russell.

==Timeframe==
This book takes place from 26 December 1920 to early February in 1921. Locations include [[London]], [[Oxford]] and Sussex. Mary turns 21 on January 2, 1921, and Holmes's age is 58.

==Characters==
*[[Mary Russell (fictional)|Mary Russell]]
*[[Sherlock Holmes]]
*Veronica Beaconsfield
*Margery Childe
*[[Mycroft Holmes]]
*[[Inspector Lestrade]]

==Feminism and Religion==
The book deals heavily with the intersection of [[feminism]] and [[religion]]; more specifically, their combination in the form of the character Margery Childe. When Mary first hears her speak, Margery is discussing a passage from [[1 Corinthians]] in the Christian [[Bible]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Women should keep silence in church; for they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as the law says...It is shameful for a woman to speak in church."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Margery's conclusion is that men are afraid of the questions women might ask concerning religion, the Bible, and God, and realize that women are not inferior. She points out that the Bible describes both men and women being created in God's image - not just males. She dissects the "Adam's rib" creation story, noting that humanity was not complete until woman was created. 
Mary, a theology scholar, mentions to Margery that in the original biblical manuscripts, there are numerous references to God in the feminine; using "She" and "Her" instead of "His and "Him". Mary has learned through her research that these references were removed as the works were translated into other languages, presumably so that God would appear as a wholly masculine being. 
In an author interview, Laurie R. King is noted to describe herself as a "...feminist-although that basically means I support the right of a woman to get paid for doing the same job as a man, not that I believe men to be inferior or superfluous."

==Holmes's Past==
There is a mention of Holmes having fathered a son, and to Holmes having gone through a very rough period while his son fought a drug addiction. There are also references to a relationship with [[Irene Adler]].

==Reception==
In a paper examining the feminist narrative in a contemporary context, Lillian Doherty felt disappointed by the ending, believing Mary failed to "uphold the honour of the feminists" when she needed to be rescued by Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0q9depdhZgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA18 |first=Lillian |last=Doherty |title=Texts, Ideas, and the Classics: Scholarship, Theory, and Classical Literature |year=2001 |pages=117–119 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-924746-2 |chapter =The Snares of the Odyssey: a Feminist Narratological Reading |editor=S.

== History ==
===Origins===
Before the 1980s, "airhead" was general American slang for a ditzy, clumsy or stupid person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KT-cAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA398&amp;dq=airhead%20preppy&amp;pg=PA398#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang|first1=John|last1=Ayto|first2=John|last2=Simpson|date=11 February 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of the [[valley girl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/06z9x0lmcfgo/valley-girl-and-identity-creation/|title="Valley Girl" and identity creation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[preppy]] subculture however, the term was applied to [[cheerleader]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://themycenaean.org/2011/11/cheerleaders-is-the-media-to-blame-for-stereotypes/ Cheerleader stereotypes]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nouveau riche]] or middle class hangers-on who imitated the [[uptalk]] speech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/body-odd/we-all-speak-valley-girls-now-f2D11722245|title=We all speak like Valley girls now - NBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and clothing of the upper class popular girls. These airheads, [[Material girl (disambiguation)|material girl]]s or [[wikt:gold digger|gold digger]]s were stereotypically viewed by their classmates as unintelligent, gossipy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086525/|title=Valley Girl|date=29 April 1983|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bimbettes]] who were interested solely in spreading rumors about their rivals and entering relationships with the wealthy jocks.&lt;ref name="inthe80s.com"/&gt;

===1990s and 2000s===
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, airheads began to be regarded as a distinct, middle class subculture in many suburban American high schools, although appearance-wise they initially differed little from the traditionalist upper class preps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2009/07/16/let_me_school_you_about_preppies/ Difference between preps and airheads]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, many wealthy white [[jock (athlete)|jock]]s and younger [[preppies]] had begun imitating urban fashion trends, eschewing the semi-formal conservative look of the 1980s and 1990s in favor of gold [[bling]], expensive [[designer clothes]], [[sneakers (footwear)|sneakers]], dark jeans, and [[sweatpants]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100110062908/http://www.undertheboards.com/excerpts.html Last White Superstar]. Web.archive.org (10 January 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Rich girls who dressed this way were known as ''[[Queen bee (sociology)|Queen Bees]]'' and their followers were known as ''plastics'', or ''airheads''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/meanest-high-school-girls-movies/|title=The Meanest High School Girls in Movies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of this clique believed their designer clothing, as a manifestation of [[conspicuous consumption]], was key to being popular.&lt;ref name="the Book of Lists for Teens"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=08vSo8ASgWsC|title=the Book of Lists for Teens|first1=Sandra|last1=Choron|first2=Harry|last2=Choron|date=24 October 2002|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 onwards===
The term ''basic bitch'' was coined in 2009&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/basic-class-anxiety Basic bitch class anxiety?]&lt;/ref&gt; by comedian [[Lil Duval|Lil' Duval]].&lt;ref name=TheCut /&gt;&lt;ref name=Alter /&gt; Over the next two years, it appeared in several American rap songs. In the songs "Hard in the Paint" by [[Tyga]] and "I'm not a Human Being" by [[Lil Wayne]], the singers insist that they are not basic bitches, while in the song "Basic Bitch" by [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]], the singer warns others to avoid basic bitches because they are fake.&lt;ref name=TheCut&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/04/basic-bitch-who-is-she.html|title= The ‘Basic Bitch’: Who Is She?|work=NYMag.com|author= Maggie Lange |date=April 10, 2014|accessdate= September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, rapper [[Kreayshawn]] debuted her song "Gucci Gucci," which included the chorus: "Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis, Fendi Fendi, Prada ... basic bitches wear that shit so I don't even bother." In 2014 [[CollegeHumor]] released a parody video of a wife being diagnosed by a doctor as a "basic bitch", to the horror of her husband.&lt;ref name=Vox&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/4/22/5636156/basic-a-beginners-guide-to-everyones-favorite-new-insult|title= "Basic": a beginner's guide to everyone's favorite new insult|author= Alex Abad-Santos |work=Vox.com|date=April 22, 2014|accessdate= September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schreiber /&gt;&lt;ref name=Alter /&gt;

== Interpretations and criticism ==
Referring to an object or a person as "basic" has a variety of connotations. When used to refer to people, it can mean a criticism of shallow [[Economic materialism|materialism]];{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} in songs that use the term, popular luxury brands like [[Gucci]] and [[Prada]] are referenced to suggest that the people who wear them are buying, rather than earning, their fashionability and [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bustle.com/articles/39504-how-to-spot-the-basic-bitch-a-field-guide How to spot a basic bitch]&lt;/ref&gt; Decrying the basic bitch's love of bland, boring products like [[Ugg boots]] and [[Starbucks]] [[pumpkin spice latte]]s is a rhetorical technique that allows the singer to appear cooler by comparison.&lt;ref name=AmericanReader&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theamericanreader.com/the-life-and-death-of-american-slang-part-ii-bae-and-basic-bitch/|author=Michael Reid Roberts|work=The American Reader|title=The Life and Death of American Slang, Part II: Bae and Basic Bitch|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapper Kreayshawn describes a basic bitch as: "A basic bitch is just someone who likes what's typical to like. The radio puts stuff on the radio that they think is typical and you should like it, and that's something a basic bitch would like. She likes those normal brands and wears them all the time because that's some basic shit."&lt;ref name=TheCut /&gt; [[Lohanthony]], who made a ten-second viral video in 2012 in which he said "Calling all the basic bitches, calling the basic bitches, there's a new announcement: You're basic", describes basic bitches as "someone who does what everyone else is doing and isn't their own person at all".&lt;ref name=TheCut /&gt;

In an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' titled, "Why I'm proud to be a 'basic bitch'", journalist Daisy Buchanan has criticized the cultural trend of using "basic bitch" as an insult, pointing out that those who call out other women for being basic bitches are "dismissing all cultural feminine signifiers" and "make assumptions about a woman's interests and habits based on her gender."&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/14/proud-to-be-basic-bitch|author=Daisy Buchanan|work=The Guardian|title=Why I'm proud to be a 'basic bitch'|date=April 14, 2014|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread usage of the term to mock the behavior and interests of girlfriends or wives "conforms to the most bland and uncreative stereotypes of [[Late capitalism|late capitalist]] femininity" and suggests a misogynistic attitude toward all women, according to Michael Reid Roberts in an article in ''The American Reader''.&lt;ref name=AmericanReader /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1537">'''Anarâškielâ servi''' (Inari Sámi Language Association) is a [[Sámi people|Sámi]] association from [[Inari, Finland|Inari]], [[Finland]]. The association was founded in the auditorium of the Ivalo Hotel in [[Ivalo]] on December 4, 1986 by [[Veikko Aikio]], [[Ilmari Mattus]] and [[Matti Morottaja]]. 
Morottaja was chosen to be the association's first president.

The goal of the association is to promote [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sámi]] and its use. In 1997, the association established an Inari-Sámi language immersion program called Kielâpiervâl for 3-6-year-old children in a day care in Inari and Ivalo. The language-immersion program has been key in increasing the number of Inari Sámi speakers, especially amongst children and young adults. The association also publishes a number of [[book]]s, [[textbook]]s, a calendar, films, music, etc. In addition, it puts out two Inari Sámi publications: the member bulletin [[Anarâš]] and the on-line [[Kierâš]] newspaper.

The association received the [[Gollegiella Award]] on November 17, 2004.

In [[historiography]], '''ancient Rome''' is Roman civilization from the founding of the city of Rome in the 8th century BC to the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD, encompassing the [[Roman Kingdom]], [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]] until the fall of the western empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Rome|title=ancient Rome {{!}} Facts, Maps, &amp; History|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The civilization began as an [[Italic peoples|Italic]] settlement in the [[Roman Italy|Italian peninsula]], dating from the 8th century BC, that grew into the city of [[Rome]] and which subsequently gave its name to the empire over which it ruled and to the widespread [[civilisation]] the empire developed. The Roman empire expanded to become one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires]] in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], though still ruled from the city, with an estimated 50 to 90&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population&lt;ref&gt;There are several different estimates for the population of the Roman Empire.

In its many centuries of existence, the Roman state evolved from a [[Roman Kingdom|monarchy]] to a [[Classical Republic]] and then to an increasingly [[Autocracy|autocratic]] [[empire]]. Through [[invasion|conquest]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], it eventually dominated the Mediterranean region, [[Western Europe]], [[Asia Minor]], [[North Africa]], and parts of [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. It is often grouped into [[classical antiquity]] together with [[ancient Greece]], and their similar cultures and societies are known as the [[Greco-Roman world]].

Ancient Roman civilisation has contributed to modern government, law, politics, engineering, art, literature, architecture, technology, warfare, religion, language, and society. Rome professionalised and expanded its military and created a system of government called ''[[res publica]]'', the inspiration for modern [[republic]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGxiE6jvzOcC|title=A Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution|page=793|editor1-last=Furet|editor1-first=François|editor2-last=Ozouf|editor2-first=Mona|publisher=Harvard University Press|date=1989|isbn=0674177282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Democratization_in_the_South.html?id=RMDnAAAAIAAJ|title=Democratization in the South: The Jagged Wave|page=11|last1=Luckham|first1=Robin|last2=White|first2=Gordon|publisher=Manchester University Press|date=1996|isbn=0719049423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/American_Republicanism.html?id=zN7lgzjettgC|title=American Republicanism: Roman Ideology in the United States Constitution|page=90|last=Sellers|first=Mortimer N.|publisher=NYU Press|date=1994|isbn=0814780059}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[United States]] and [[France]]. It achieved impressive [[Roman technology|technological]] and [[Ancient Roman architecture|architectural]] feats, such as the construction of an extensive system of [[Roman aqueducts|aqueducts]] and [[Roman roads|roads]], as well as the construction of large monuments, palaces, and public facilities.

By the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] (27 BC), Rome had conquered the lands around the Mediterranean and beyond: its domain extended from the Atlantic to [[Arabia Petraea|Arabia]] and from the mouth of the [[Rhine]] to North Africa. The [[Roman Empire]] emerged with the end of the Republic and the dictatorship of [[Augustus Caesar]]. 721 years of [[Roman-Persian Wars]] started in 92&amp;nbsp;BC with their first war against [[Roman-Parthian Wars|Parthia]]. It would become the longest conflict in human history, and have major lasting effects and consequences for both empires. Under [[Trajan]], the Empire reached its territorial peak. Republican mores and traditions started to decline during the imperial period, with civil wars becoming a prelude common to the rise of a new emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Greatness_and_Decline_of_Rome.html?id=_TsTAAAAYAAJ|title=The Greatness and Decline of Rome, Volume 2|page=215|last=Ferrero|first=Guglielmo|translator1-last=Zimmern|translator1-first=Sir Alfred Eckhard|translator2-last=Chaytor|translator2-first=Henry John|publisher=G.

This splintering is a landmark historians use to divide the [[ancient]] period of [[universal history]] from the pre-medieval "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]" of Europe. The [[Eastern Roman empire|eastern part of the empire]] endured through the 5th century and remained a power throughout the "Dark Ages" and medieval times until its fall in 1453 AD. Although the citizens of the empire made no distinction, the empire is most commonly referred to as the "[[Byzantine Empire]]" by modern historians during the Middle Ages to differentiate between the state of [[Ancient history|antiquity]] and the nation it grew into.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Byzantine_Empire/|title=Byzantine Empire|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding myth==
{{Main|Founding of Rome}}
According to the [[founding myth]] of Rome, the [[founding of Rome|city was founded]] on 21 April 753&amp;nbsp;BC by the twin brothers [[Romulus and Remus]], who descended from the [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Lesley|last2=Adkins|first2=Roy|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|page=3|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-512332-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who were grandsons of the Latin King [[Numitor]] of [[Alba Longa]]. King Numitor was deposed by his brother, [[Amulius]], while Numitor's daughter, [[Rhea Silvia]], gave birth to the twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavazzi|first1=F.|title=The Founding of Rome|url=http://www.roman-empire.net/founding/found-index.html|website=Illustrated History of the Roman Empire|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=livy8 &gt;{{cite book|last1=Livius|first1=Titus (Livy)|translator-last1=Luce|translator-first1=T.J.|title=The Rise of Rome, Books 1–5|date=1998|publisher=Oxford World's Classics|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-282296-9|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Rhea Silvia had been raped and impregnated by [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the Roman [[god of war]], the twins were considered [[demigod|half-divine]].

[[File:Capitoline she-wolf Musei Capitolini MC1181.jpg|thumb|left|According to legend, [[founding of Rome|Rome was founded]] in 753&amp;nbsp;BC by [[Romulus and Remus]], who were raised by a she-wolf]]
The new king, Amulius, feared Romulus and Remus would take back the throne, so he ordered them to be drowned.&lt;ref name=livy8 /&gt; A [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] (or a shepherd's wife in some accounts) saved and raised them, and when they were old enough, they returned the throne of Alba Longa to Numitor.&lt;ref name="Caesarandchrist" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|last2=Durant|first2=Ariel|title=[[The Story of Civilization]] – Volume III: Caesar and Christ|date=1944|publisher=Simon and Schuster, Inc.|location=United States|isbn=978-1567310238|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=livy8 /&gt;

The twins then founded their own city, but Romulus killed Remus in a quarrel over the location of the [[Roman Kingdom]], though some sources state the quarrel was about who was going to rule or give his name to the city.&lt;ref&gt;Roggen, Hesse, Haastrup, Omnibus I, H. Aschehoug &amp; Co 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Romulus became the source of the city's name.&lt;ref name=livy8 /&gt; In order to attract people to the city, Rome became a sanctuary for the indigent, exiled, and unwanted. This caused a problem, in that Rome came to have a large male population but was bereft of women. Romulus visited neighboring towns and tribes and attempted to secure marriage rights, but as Rome was so full of undesirables he was refused. Legend says that the Latins invited the [[Sabine]]s to a festival and [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|stole their unmarried maidens]], leading to the integration of the Latins with the Sabines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/grecoromanmyth1/a/mythslegends_3.htm Myths and Legends- Rome, the Wolf, and Mars]. Retrieved 8 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another legend, recorded by Greek historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], says that Prince Aeneas led a group of Trojans on a sea voyage to found a new Troy, since the original was destroyed at the end of the [[Trojan War]]. After a long time in rough seas, they landed on the banks of the [[Tiber River]]. Not long after they landed, the men wanted to take to the sea again, but the women who were traveling with them did not want to leave. One woman, named Roma, suggested that the women burn the ships out at sea to prevent their leaving. At first, the men were angry with Roma, but they soon realized that they were in the ideal place to settle. They named the settlement after the woman who torched their ships.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, Ronald and McGee Marni, ''The Ancient Roman World'' p. 15 (Cited 15 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman poet [[Virgil]] recounted this legend in his classical epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'', where the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]] is destined by the gods to found a new Troy. In the epic, the women also refuse to go back to the sea, but they were not left on the Tiber. After reaching Italy, Aeneas, who wanted to marry [[Lavinia]], was forced to wage war with her former suitor, [[Turnus]]. According to the poem, the [[Latin kings of Alba Longa|Alban kings]] were descended from Aeneas, and thus Romulus, the founder of Rome, was his descendant.

The city of Rome grew from settlements around a ford on the river [[Tiber]], a crossroads of traffic and trade.&lt;ref name="Caesarandchrist" /&gt; According to [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence, the village of Rome was probably founded some time in the 8th century BC, though it may go back as far as the 10th century BC, by members of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin tribe]] of Italy, on the top of the [[Palatine Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matyszak|first1=Philip|title=Chronicle of the Roman Republic|date=2003|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=0-500-05121-6|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duiker|first1=William|last2=Spielvogel|first2=Jackson|title=World History|date=2001|publisher=Wadsworth|isbn=0-534-57168-9|page=129|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], who had previously settled to the north in [[Etruria]], seem to have established political control in the region by the late 7th century BC, forming an aristocratic and monarchical elite.

In the 3rd century BC Rome faced a new and formidable opponent: [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]]. Carthage was a rich, flourishing [[Phoenicia]]n [[city-state]] that intended to dominate the Mediterranean area. The two cities were allies in the times of Pyrrhus, who was a menace to both, but with Rome's hegemony in mainland Italy and the Carthaginian [[thalassocracy]], these cities became the two major powers in the Western Mediterranean and their contention over the Mediterranean led to conflict.

The [[First Punic War]] began in 264&amp;nbsp;BC, when the city of [[Messina|Messana]] asked for Carthage's help in their conflicts with [[Hiero II of Syracuse]]. After the Carthaginian intercession, Messana asked Rome to expel the Carthaginians. Rome entered this war because [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and Messana were too close to the newly conquered Greek cities of Southern Italy and Carthage was now able to make an offensive through Roman territory; along with this, Rome could extend its domain over [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/11*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', XI, XLIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Romans had experience in land battles, to defeat this new enemy, naval battles were necessary. Carthage was a maritime power, and the Roman lack of ships and naval experience would make the path to the victory a long and difficult one for the [[Roman Republic]]. Despite this, after more than 20 years of war, Rome defeated Carthage and a peace treaty was signed. Among the reasons for the [[Second Punic War]]&lt;ref&gt;New historical atlas and general history By Robert Henlopen Labberton. Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; was the subsequent war reparations Carthage acquiesced to at the end of the First Punic War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=imzQwjVwxXYC&amp;pg=PA652|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=1911|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Company|pages=652–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second Punic War is famous for its brilliant generals: on the Punic side [[Hannibal]] and [[Hasdrubal (Barcid)|Hasdrubal]]; on the Roman, [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]], [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] and [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio]]. Rome fought this war simultaneously with the [[First Macedonian War]].

The war began with the audacious invasion of Hispania by Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who had led operations on Sicily in the First Punic War. Hannibal, son of [[Hamilcar Barca]], rapidly marched through [[Hispania]] to the Italian [[Alps]], causing panic among Rome's Italian allies. The best way found to defeat Hannibal's purpose of causing the Italians to abandon Rome was to delay the Carthaginians with a [[guerrilla]] war of attrition, a strategy propounded by Quintus Fabius Maximus, who would be nicknamed ''Cunctator'' ("delayer" in Latin), and whose strategy would be forever after known as [[Fabian strategy|Fabian]]. Due to this, Hannibal's goal was unachieved: he could not bring enough Italian cities to revolt against Rome and replenish his diminishing army, and he thus lacked the machines and manpower to besiege Rome.

Still, Hannibal's invasion lasted over 16 years, ravaging Italy. Finally, when the Romans perceived that Hannibal's supplies were running out, they sent Scipio, who had defeated Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal in Spain, to invade the unprotected Carthaginian hinterland and force Hannibal to return to defend Carthage itself. The result was the ending of the Second Punic War by the famously decisive [[Battle of Zama]] in October 202&amp;nbsp;BC, which gave to Scipio his [[agnomen]] ''Africanus''. At great cost, Rome had made significant gains: the conquest of Hispania by Scipio, and of Syracuse, the last Greek realm in Sicily, by Marcellus.

More than a half century after these events, Carthage was humiliated and Rome was no more concerned about the African menace. The Republic's focus now was only to the [[Hellenistic]] kingdoms of Greece and revolts in Hispania. However, Carthage, after having paid the war indemnity, felt that its commitments and submission to Rome had ceased, a vision not shared by the [[Roman Senate]]. When in 151&amp;nbsp;BC [[Numidia]] invaded Carthage, Carthage asked for Roman intercession. Ambassadors were sent to Carthage, among them was [[Cato the Elder|Marcus Porcius Cato]], who after seeing that Carthage could make a comeback and regain its importance, ended all his speeches, no matter what the subject was, by saying: "''[[Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam]]''" ("Furthermore, I think that Carthage must be destroyed").

As Carthage fought with Numidia without Roman consent, the [[Third Punic War]] began when Rome declared war against Carthage in 149&amp;nbsp;BC. Carthage resisted well at the first strike, with the participation of all the inhabitants of the city. However, Carthage could not withstand the attack of [[Scipio Aemilianus]], who entirely destroyed the city and its walls, enslaved and sold all the citizens and gained control of that region, which became the province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. Thus ended the Punic War period.

All these wars resulted in Rome's first overseas conquests ([[Sicily]], [[Hispania]] and Africa) and the rise of Rome as a significant imperial power and began the end of democracy.

Violent gangs of the urban unemployed, controlled by rival Senators, intimidated the electorate through violence. The situation came to a head in the late 2nd century BC under the [[Gracchi]] brothers, a pair of [[tribune]]s who attempted to pass land reform legislation that would redistribute the major patrician landholdings among the plebeians. Both brothers were killed and the Senate passed reforms reversing the Gracchi brother's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Twenty_six_Centuries_of_Agrarian_Reform.html?id=kmZHKOHgvFQC|title=Twenty-six Centuries of Agrarian Reform: A Comparative Analysis|page=34|last=Tuma|first=Elias H.|publisher=University of California Press|date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the growing divide of the plebeian groups ([[populares]]) and equestrian classes ([[optimates]]).

=== Marius and Sulla ===
[[Gaius Marius]], a ''[[novus homo]]'', who started his political career with the help of the powerful [[Metelli]] family soon become a leader of the Republic, holding the first of his seven consulships (an unprecedented number) in 107&amp;nbsp;BC by arguing that his former patron [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus]] was not able to defeat and capture the Numidian king [[Jugurtha]]. Marius then started his military reform: in his recruitment to fight Jugurtha, he levied very poor (an innovation) and many landless men entered the army; this was the seed of securing loyalty of the army to the General in command.

At this time, Marius began his quarrel with [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]: Marius, who wanted to capture Jugurtha, asked [[Bocchus I|Bocchus]], son-in-law of Jugurtha, to hand him over. As Marius failed, Sulla, a [[Legatus|general]] of Marius at that time, in a dangerous enterprise, went himself to Bocchus and convinced Bocchus to hand Jugurtha over to him. This was very provocative to Marius, since many of his enemies were encouraging Sulla to oppose Marius. Despite this, Marius was elected for five consecutive consulships from 104 to 100&amp;nbsp;BC, as Rome needed a military leader to defeat the [[Cimbri]] and the [[Teutones]], who were threatening Rome.

[[File:Sulla Glyptothek Munich 309.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]]]
After Marius's retirement, Rome had a brief peace, during which the Italian ''socii'' ("allies" in Latin) requested Roman citizenship and voting rights. The reformist [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Marcus Livius Drusus]] supported their legal process but was assassinated, and the ''socii'' revolted against the Romans in the [[Social War (91-88&amp;nbsp;BC)|Social War]]. At one point both consuls were killed; Marius was appointed to command the army together with [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 90&amp;nbsp;BC)|Lucius Julius Caesar]] and Sulla.&lt;ref name="WHdP-EBp760"/&gt;

By the end of the Social War, Marius and Sulla were the premier military men in Rome and their partisans were in conflict, both sides jostling for power. In 88&amp;nbsp;BC, Sulla was elected for his first consulship and his first assignment was to defeat [[Mithridates VI]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], whose intentions were to conquer the Eastern part of the Roman territories. However, Marius's partisans managed his installation to the military command, defying Sulla and the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], and this caused Sulla's wrath. To consolidate his own power, Sulla conducted a surprising and illegal action: [[Sulla's first civil war|he marched to Rome]] with his legions, killing all those who showed support to Marius's cause and impaling their heads in the [[Roman Forum]]. In the following year, 87&amp;nbsp;BC, Marius, who had fled at Sulla's march, returned to Rome while Sulla was campaigning in Greece. He seized power along with the consul [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] and killed the other consul, [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)|Gnaeus Octavius]], achieving his seventh consulship. In an attempt to raise Sulla's anger, Marius and Cinna revenged their partisans by conducting a massacre.&lt;ref name="WHdP-EBp760"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Harrison De Puy|title=The Encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, and general literature ; the R.S.

Marius died in 86&amp;nbsp;BC, due to age and poor health, just a few months after seizing power. Cinna exercised absolute power until his death in 84&amp;nbsp;BC. Sulla after returning from his Eastern campaigns, had a free path to reestablish his own power. In 83&amp;nbsp;BC he made his [[Sulla's second civil war|second march in Rome]] and began a time of terror: thousands of nobles, knights and senators were executed. Sulla also held two [[Roman dictator|dictatorships]] and one more consulship, which began the crisis and decline of Roman Republic.&lt;ref name="WHdP-EBp760"/&gt;

===Caesar and the First Triumvirate===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Giulio-cesare-enhanced 1-800x1450.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Caesar from the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]]]

In the mid-1st century BC, Roman politics were restless. Political divisions in Rome became identified with two groupings, ''[[populares]]'' (who hoped for the support of the people) and ''[[optimates]]'' (the "best", who wanted to maintain exclusive aristocratic control). Sulla overthrew all populist leaders and his constitutional reforms removed powers (such as those of the [[tribune of the plebs]]) that had supported populist approaches. Meanwhile, social and economic stresses continued to build; Rome had become a metropolis with a super-rich aristocracy, debt-ridden aspirants, and a large proletariat often of impoverished farmers. The latter groups supported the [[Catiline|Catilinarian conspiracy]] – a resounding failure, since the consul [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] quickly arrested and executed the main leaders of the conspiracy.

Onto this turbulent scene emerged [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]], from an aristocratic family of limited wealth. [[Julia (wife of Marius)|His aunt Julia]] was Marius' wife,&lt;ref name=Plutarch&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html Plutarch Parallel Lives], ''Life of Caesar'', I,2&lt;/ref&gt; and Caesar identified with the populares. To achieve power, Caesar reconciled the two most powerful men in Rome: [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], who had financed much of his earlier career, and Crassus' rival, [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] (anglicized as Pompey), to whom he married [[Julia (daughter of Julius Caesar)|his daughter]]. He formed them into a new informal alliance including himself, the [[First Triumvirate]] ("three men"). This satisfied the interests of all three: Crassus, the richest man in Rome, became richer and ultimately achieved high military command; Pompey exerted more influence in the Senate; and Caesar obtained the consulship and military command in [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scullard|first1=Howard Hayes|title=From the Gracchi to Nero|date=1982|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-02527-3|edition=5th}}Chapters VI-VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; So long as they could agree, the three were in effect the rulers of Rome.

In 54&amp;nbsp;BC, Caesar's daughter, Pompey's wife, died in childbirth, unraveling one link in the alliance. In 53&amp;nbsp;BC, Crassus invaded [[Parthia]] and was killed in the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. The Triumvirate disintegrated at Crassus' death. Crassus had acted as mediator between Caesar and Pompey, and, without him, the two generals manoeuvred against each other for power. Caesar [[Gallic Wars|conquered Gaul]], obtaining immense wealth, respect in Rome and the loyalty of battle-hardened legions. He also became a clear menace to Pompey and was loathed by many ''optimates''. Confident that Caesar could be stopped by legal means, Pompey's party tried to strip Caesar of his legions, a prelude to Caesar's trial, impoverishment, and exile.

To avoid this fate, Caesar [[Caesar's Civil War|crossed the Rubicon]] River and invaded Rome in 49&amp;nbsp;BC. Pompey and his party fled from Italy, pursued by Caesar. The [[Battle of Pharsalus]] was a brilliant victory for Caesar and in this and other campaigns he destroyed all of the ''optimates''' leaders: [[Metellus Scipio]], [[Cato the Younger]], and Pompey's son, [[Gnaeus Pompeius (son of Pompey the Great)|Gnaeus Pompeius]]. Pompey was murdered in Egypt in 48&amp;nbsp;BC. Caesar was now pre-eminent over Rome, attracting the bitter enmity of many aristocrats. He was granted many offices and honours. In just five years, he held four consulships, two ordinary dictatorships, and two special dictatorships: one for ten years and another for perpetuity. He was murdered in 44&amp;nbsp;BC, on the [[Ides of March]] by the ''[[Liberatores]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/caesar_julius.shtml Julius Caesar (100BC – 44BC)].

Caesar's assassination caused political and social turmoil in Rome; without the dictator's leadership, the city was ruled by his friend and colleague, [[Mark Antony]]. Soon afterward, [[Augustus|Octavius]], whom Caesar adopted through his will, arrived in Rome. Octavian (historians regard Octavius as Octavian due to the [[Roman naming conventions]]) tried to align himself with the Caesarian faction.

Upon its formation, 130–300 senators were executed, and their property was confiscated, due to their supposed support for the ''[[Liberatores]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/auggie.htm Augustus (31 BC – 14 AD)] by Garrett G.

The Second Triumvirate was marked by the [[proscription]]s of many senators and ''equites'': after a revolt led by Antony's brother [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]], more than 300 senators and ''equites'' involved were executed on the anniversary of the [[Ides of March]], although Lucius was spared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#ref53] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XV.&lt;/ref&gt; The Triumvirate proscribed several important men, including [[Cicero]], whom Antony hated;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html] Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Antony'', II, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quintus Tullius Cicero]], the younger brother of the orator; and [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 64&amp;nbsp;BC)|Lucius Julius Caesar]], cousin and friend of the acclaimed general, for his support of Cicero. However, Lucius was pardoned, perhaps because his sister Julia had intervened for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0547.html Ancient Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231545/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0547.html |date=5 June 2011 }}.

The Triumvirate divided the Empire among the triumvirs: Lepidus was given charge of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], Antony, the eastern provinces, and Octavian remained in [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italia]] and controlled [[Hispania]] and [[Gaul]].

The Second Triumvirate expired in 38&amp;nbsp;BC but was renewed for five more years. However, the relationship between Octavian and Antony had deteriorated, and Lepidus was forced to retire in 36&amp;nbsp;BC after betraying Octavian in [[Sicilian revolt|Sicily]]. By the end of the Triumvirate, Antony was living in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], an independent and rich kingdom ruled by Antony's lover, [[Cleopatra VII]]. Antony's affair with Cleopatra was seen as an act of treason, since she was queen of another country. Additionally, Antony adopted a lifestyle considered too extravagant and [[Hellenistic]] for a Roman statesman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html#ref57] Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Antony'', LXXI, 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Antony's [[Donations of Alexandria]], which [[Reign of Cleopatra VII|gave to Cleopatra]] the title of "[[Queen of Kings]]", and to Antony's and Cleopatra's children the regal titles to the newly conquered Eastern territories, [[Final War of the Roman Republic|war between Octavian and Antony broke out]]. Octavian annihilated Egyptian forces in the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Death of Cleopatra|Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide]]. Now Egypt was conquered by the Roman Empire, and for the Romans, a new era had begun.

==Empire – the Principate==
{{Main|Roman Empire}}
In 27&amp;nbsp;BC and at the age of 36, Octavian was the sole Roman leader. In that year, he took the name ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''. That event is usually taken by historians as the beginning of Roman Empire – although Rome was an "imperial" state since 146&amp;nbsp;BC, when Carthage was razed by [[Scipio Aemilianus]] and Greece was conquered by [[Lucius Mummius]]. Officially, the government was republican, but Augustus assumed absolute powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/augustus.shtml Augustus (63 BC. – AD14)] from [[BBC Online|bbc.co.uk]].

===Julio-Claudian dynasty===
The [[Julio-Claudian]] dynasty was established by Augustus. The emperors of this dynasty were: [[Augustus]], [[Tiberius]], [[Caligula]], [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]]. The dynasty is so-called due to the ''[[gens Julia]]'', family of Augustus, and the ''[[gens Claudia]]'', family of Tiberius. The Julio-Claudians started the destruction of republican values, but on the other hand, they boosted Rome's status as the central power in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jucl/hd_jucl.htm The Julio-Claudian Dynasty (27 BC −68 AD)]. by the Department of Greek and [[Roman art|Roman Art]], The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

====Augustus====
[[Augustus]] gathered almost all the republican powers under his official title, ''[[princeps]]'': he had powers of consul, ''[[princeps senatus]]'', [[aedile]], [[Roman censor|censor]] and [[tribune]] – including tribunician sacrosanctity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XXVII, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the base of an emperor's power. Augustus also styled himself as ''[[Imperator]] Gaius Julius Caesar divi filius'', "Commander Gaius Julius Caesar, son of the deified one". With this title he not only boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, but the use of ''Imperator'' signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory.

[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Augustus of Prima Porta]], 1st century AD, depicting [[Augustus]], the first [[Roman emperor]]]]
He also diminished the [[Roman Senate|Senatorial class]] influence in politics by boosting the [[equestrian class]]. The senators lost their right to rule certain provinces, like Egypt; since the governor of that province was directly nominated by the emperor. The creation of the [[Praetorian Guard]] and his reforms in the military, creating a [[standing army]] with a fixed size of 28 legions, ensured his total control over the army.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Eck, ''The Age of Augustus''&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with the Second Triumvirate's epoch, Augustus' reign as ''princeps'' was very peaceful. This peace and richness (that was granted by the agrarian province of Egypt)&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XVIII, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; led the people and the nobles of Rome to support Augustus increasing his strength in political affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Chisholm|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPktAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA912|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=1910|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Company|pages=912–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In military activity, Augustus was absent at battles. His generals were responsible for the field command; gaining such commanders as [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], [[Nero Claudius Drusus]] and [[Germanicus]] much respect from the populace and the legions. Augustus intended to extend the Roman Empire to the whole known world, and in his reign, Rome conquered [[Cantabria]] [[Aquitania]], [[Raetia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and [[Pannonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XXI, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Augustus's reign, Roman literature grew steadily in what is known as the [[Golden Age of Latin Literature]]. Poets like [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]] and [[Lucius Varius Rufus|Rufus]] developed a rich literature, and were close friends of Augustus. Along with [[Maecenas]], he stimulated patriotic poems, as Virgil's epic ''[[Aeneid]]'' and also historiographical works, like those of [[Livy]]. The works of this literary age lasted through Roman times, and are classics.

Augustus also continued the shifts on the calendar promoted by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], and the month of August is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', XXI.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus brought a peaceful and thriving era to Rome,  known as ''[[Pax Romana|Pax Augusta]]'' or ''Pax Romana''. Augustus died in 14&amp;nbsp;AD, but the empire's glory continued after his era.

The Julio-Claudians continued to rule Rome after Augustus' death and remained in power until the death of Nero in 68&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duiker|first1=William|last2=Spielvogel|first2=Jackson|title=World History|date=2001|publisher=Wadsworth|isbn=0-534-57168-9|page=140|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus' favorites for succeeding him were already dead in his senescence: his nephew [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]] died in 23&amp;nbsp;BC, his friend and military commander [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] in 12&amp;nbsp;BC and his grandson [[Gaius Caesar]] in 4&amp;nbsp;AD. Influenced by his wife, [[Livia Drusilla]], Augustus appointed her son from another marriage, [[Tiberius]], as his heir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Augustus'', LXIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate agreed with the succession, and granted to Tiberius the same titles and honors once granted to Augustus: the title of ''princeps'' and ''[[Pater patriae]]'', and the [[Civic Crown]]. However, Tiberius was not an enthusiast of political affairs: after agreement with the Senate, he retired to [[Capri]] in 26&amp;nbsp;AD,&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/57*.html#ref4] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LVII, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and left control of the city of Rome in the hands of the [[praetorian prefect]] [[Sejanus]] (until 31&amp;nbsp;AD) and [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Macro]] (from 31 to 37&amp;nbsp;AD).

====Vespasian====
[[File:Vespasianus01 pushkin edit.png|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Vespasian]], founder of the [[Flavian dynasty]]]]
Vespasian was a general under [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]]. He fought as a commander in the [[First Jewish-Roman War]] along with his son [[Titus]]. Following the turmoil of the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], in 69&amp;nbsp;AD, four emperors were enthroned: [[Galba]], [[Otho]], [[Vitellius]], and, lastly, Vespasian, who crushed Vitellius' forces and became emperor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Vespasian'', I.&lt;/ref&gt;

He reconstructed many buildings which were uncompleted, like a statue of [[Apollo]] and the temple of ''[[Claudius|Divus Claudius]]'' ("the deified Claudius"), both initiated by Nero. Buildings once destroyed by the [[Great Fire of Rome]] were rebuilt, and he revitalized the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]]. Vespasian also started the construction of the Flavian Amphitheater, more commonly known as the [[Colosseum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Vespasian'', IX.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historians [[Josephus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote their works during Vespasian's reign. Vespasian was Josephus' sponsor and Pliny dedicated his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' to Titus, son of Vespasian.

Vespasian sent legions to defend the eastern frontier in [[Cappadocia]], extended the occupation in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and reformed the tax system. He died in 79&amp;nbsp;AD.

====Titus and Domitian====
Titus had a short-lived rule; he was emperor from 79–81&amp;nbsp;AD. He finished the Flavian Amphitheater, which was constructed with war spoils from the [[First Jewish-Roman War]], and promoted games celebrating the victory over the Jews that lasted for a hundred days. These games included [[Gladiator|gladiatorial combats]], [[chariot race]]s and a sensational mock naval battle on the flooded grounds of the Colosseum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#ref7] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Titus*.html#ref9] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Titus'', VII, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus constructed a line of roads and fortifications on the borders of modern-day [[Germany]]; and his general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] conquered much of Britain, extending the Roman world to as far as Scotland. On the other hand, his failed [[Domitian's Dacian War|war against Dacia]] was a humiliating defeat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/67*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVII, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Titus died of fever in 81&amp;nbsp;AD, and was succeeded by his brother [[Domitian]]. As emperor, Domitian assumed [[totalitarian]] characteristics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#ref53] Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', ''Domitian'', X.&lt;/ref&gt; thought he could be a new [[Augustus]], and tried to make a personal cult of himself.

Domitian ruled for fifteen years, and his reign was marked by his attempts to compare himself to the gods. He constructed at least two temples in honour of Jupiter, the supreme deity in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. He also liked to be called "''Dominus et Deus''" ("Master and God").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-empire.net/emperors/domitian-index.html] from roman-empire.net – Titus Flavius Domitianus. Retrieved 29 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The nobles disliked his rule, and he was murdered by a conspiracy in 96&amp;nbsp;AD.

===Nerva–Antonine dynasty===
[[File:RomanEmpireTrajan117AD.png|thumb|The [[Roman Empire]] reached its greatest extent under [[Trajan]] in AD&amp;nbsp;117]]
The Nerva–Antonine dynasty from 96 AD to 192 AD was the rule of the emperors Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus, and Commodus. During their rule, Rome reached its territorial and economical apogee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrv.com/early-empire/five-good-emperors.php Five Good Emperors] from UNRV History. Retrieved 12 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time of peace for Rome. The criteria for choosing an emperor were the qualities of the candidate and no longer ties of kinship; additionally, there were no civil wars or military defeats in this period.

Following Domitian's murder, the Senate rapidly appointed [[Nerva]] to hold imperial dignity. This was the first time that senators chose the emperor since Octavian was honored with the titles of ''[[princeps]]'' and ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''. Nerva had a noble ancestry, and he had served as an advisor to [[Nero]] and the Flavians. His rule restored many of the liberties once assumed by Domitian&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and started the last golden era of Rome.

====Trajan====
[[File:Traiani iustitia.jpg|thumb|''The Justice of Trajan'' (fragment) by [[Eugène Delacroix]]]]
Nerva died in 98&amp;nbsp;AD and his successor and heir was the general [[Trajan]]. Trajan was born in a non-patrician family from [[Hispania]] and his preeminence emerged in the army, under Domitian. He is the second of the [[Five Good Emperors]], the first being Nerva.

Trajan was greeted by the people of Rome with enthusiasm, which he justified by governing well and without the bloodiness that had marked Domitian's reign. He freed many people who had been unjustly imprisoned by Domitian and returned private property that Domitian had confiscated; a process begun by Nerva before his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Trajan conquered Dacia]], and defeated the king [[Decebalus]], who had defeated Domitian's forces. In the [[First Dacian War]] (101–102), the defeated [[Dacia]] became a client kingdom; in the [[Second Dacian War]] (105–106), Trajan completely devastated the enemy's resistance and annexed Dacia to the Empire. Trajan also annexed the client state of [[Nabatea]] to form the province of [[Arabia Petraea]], which included the lands of southern Syria and northwestern Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

He erected many buildings that survive to this day, such as [[Trajan's Forum]], [[Trajan's Market]] and [[Trajan's Column]]. His main architect was [[Apollodorus of Damascus]]; Apollodorus made the project of the Forum and of the Column, and also reformed the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. Trajan's triumphal arches in [[Ancona]] and [[Benevento|Beneventum]] are other constructions projected by him. In the Second Dacian War, Apollodorus made a [[Trajan's Bridge|great bridge over the Danube]] for Trajan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Traianus Glyptothek Munich 336.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Marble bust of Trajan]]
Trajan's final war was against [[Parthia]]. When Parthia appointed a king for [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] who was unacceptable to Rome (Parthia and Rome shared dominance over Armenia), he declared war. He probably wanted to be the first Roman leader to conquer Parthia, and repeat the glory of [[Alexander the Great]], conqueror of Asia, whom Trajan next followed in the clash of Greek-Romans and the Persian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferdinand Gregorovius|title=The Emperor Hadrian: A Picture of the Graeco-Roman World in His Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D20G5zMpPfUC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=1898|publisher=Macmillan|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 113 he marched to Armenia and deposed the local king. In 115 Trajan turned south into the core of Parthian hegemony, took the Northern Mesopotamian cities of [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]] and [[Batnae]], organized a province of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Mesopotamia]] (116), and issued coins announcing that Armenia and Mesopotamia was under the authority of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXVIII, 17–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In that same year, he captured [[Seleucia]] and the Parthian capital [[Ctesiphon]]. After defeating a Parthian revolt and a [[Kitos War|Jewish revolt]], he withdrew due to health issues. In 117, his illness grew and he died of [[edema]]. He nominated [[Hadrian]] as his heir. Under Trajan's leadership the Roman Empire reached the peak of its territorial expansion; Rome's dominion now spanned {{convert|2500000|mi2|0|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name= Atlas&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scarre|first1=Chris|title=The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Rome|date=September 1995|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-051329-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====From Hadrian to Commodus====
The prosperity brought by [[Nerva]] and [[Trajan]] continued in the reigns of subsequent emperors, from [[Hadrian]] to [[Marcus Aurelius]]. Hadrian withdrew all the troops stationed in Parthia and Mesopotamia, abandoning Trajan's conquests. Although facing another [[Bar Kokhba revolt|revolt in Judea]], Hadrian's government was very peaceful, since he avoided wars: he constructed fortifications and walls, like the famous [[Hadrian's Wall]] between [[Roman Britain]] and the barbarians of modern-day Scotland.

A famous [[philhellenism|philhellenist]], Hadrian promoted culture, specially the Greek. He also forbade [[torture]] and humanized the laws. Hadrian built many aqueducts, baths, libraries and theaters; additionally, he traveled nearly every single province in the Empire to check the military and infrastructural conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Hadrian/1*.html] Historia Augusta, ''Life of Hadrian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hadrian's death in 138 AD, his successor [[Antoninus Pius]] built temples, theaters, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of [[rhetoric]] and philosophy. Antoninus made few initial changes when he became emperor, leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by Hadrian. Antoninus expanded the Roman Britain by invading southern Scotland and building the [[Antonine Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Antoninus_Pius*.html#ref34] ''Historia Augusta'', ''Life of Antoninus Pius'', V, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued Hadrian's policy of humanizing the laws. He died in 161&amp;nbsp;AD.

[[Marcus Aurelius]], known as the Philosopher, was the last of the [[Five Good Emperors]]. He was a stoic philosopher and wrote the ''[[Meditations]]''. He defeated barbarian tribes in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] as well as the [[Parthian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXVII.&lt;/ref&gt; His co-emperor, [[Lucius Verus]] died in 169&amp;nbsp;AD, probably victim of the [[Antonine Plague]], a pandemic that killed nearly five million people through the Empire in 165–180&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm Past pandemics that ravaged Europe] by Verity Murphy. [[BBC News]]. 7 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Nerva to Marcus Aurelius, the empire achieved an unprecedented happy and glorious status. The powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. All the citizens enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth. The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence. The Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} The [[Five Good Emperors]]' rule is considered the golden era of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|editor1-last=Bury|editor1-first=J.B.|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|date=1906|publisher=Fred de Fau and Co.|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/gibbon-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-12-vols|language=English|format=Online version|chapter=Chapter I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commodus]], son of Marcus Aurelius, became emperor after his father's death. He is not counted as one of the [[Five Good Emperors]]. Firstly, this was due to his direct kinship with the latter emperor; in addition, he was passive in comparison with his predecessors, who were frequently leading their armies in person. Commodus usually took part on gladiatorial combats, which often symbolized brutality and roughness. He killed many citizens, and his reign was the beginning of Roman [[decadence]], as stated [[Cassius Dio]]: "(Rome has transformed) from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#36] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXII, 36, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Severan dynasty===
Commodus was killed by a conspiracy involving [[Quintus Aemilius Laetus]] and his wife Marcia in late 192&amp;nbsp;AD. The following year is known as the [[Year of the Five Emperors]], during which [[Helvius Pertinax]], [[Didius Julianus]], [[Pescennius Niger]], [[Clodius Albinus]] and [[Septimius Severus]] held the imperial dignity. Pertinax, a member of the senate who had been one of Marcus Aurelius's right hand men, was the choice of Laetus, and he ruled vigorously and judiciously. Laetus soon became jealous and instigated Pertinax's murder by the Praetorian Guard, who then auctioned the empire to the highest bidder, Didius Julianus, for 25,000 sesterces per man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cary|first1=Max|title=A History of Rome Down to the Reign of Constantine|date=1967|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|page=704|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Rome were appalled and appealed to the frontier legions to save them. The legions of three frontier provinces—[[Roman Britain|Britain]], [[Pannonia Superior]], and [[Roman Syria|Syria]]—resented being excluded from the "donative" and replied by declaring their individual generals to be emperor. Lucius Septimius Severus Geta, the Pannonian commander, bribed the opposing forces, pardoned the Praetorian Guards and installed himself as emperor. He and his successors governed with the legions' support. The changes on [[coin]]age and military expenditures were the root of the financial crisis that marked the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].

==== Septimius Severus ====
[[File:Septimusseverustondo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Severan Tondo]], c. 199, Severus, Julia Domna, Caracalla and Geta, whose face is erased]]
Severus was enthroned after invading Rome and having [[Didius Julianus]] killed. His two other rivals, [[Pescennius Niger]] and [[Clodius Albinus]], were both were hailed by other factions as ''Imperator''. Severus quickly subdued Niger in [[Byzantium]] and promised to Albinus the title of Caesar (which meant he would be a co-emperor).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/75*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXV, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Severus betrayed Albinus by blaming him for a plot against his life. Severus marched to [[Gaul]] and defeated Albinus. For these acts, [[Machiavelli]] said that Severus was "a ferocious lion and a clever fox"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/ml/libri/m/MachiavelliNB_IlPrincipe_s.pdf] Machiavelli, ''Il Principe'', XIX (in Italian).&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus attempted to revive totalitarianism and in an address to people and the Senate, he praised the severity and cruelty of Marius and Sulla, which worried the senators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/76*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXVI, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Parthia]] invaded Roman territory, Severus waged war against that country. He seized the cities of [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]], [[Babylon]] and [[Seleucia]]. Reaching [[Ctesiphon]], the Parthian capital, he ordered plundering and his army slew and captured many people. Albeit this military success, he failed in invading [[Hatra]], a rich Arabian city. Severus killed his legate, as the latter was gaining respect from the legions; and his soldiers were hit by famine. After this disastrous campaign, he withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/76*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXVI, 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Severus also intended to vanquish the whole of [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. To achieve this, he waged war against the [[Caledonians]]. After many casualties in the army due to the terrain and the barbarians' ambushes, Severus went himself to the field. However, he became ill and died in 211&amp;nbsp;AD, at the age of 65.

====From Caracalla to Alexander Severus====
[[File:Bust of Caracalla Antikensammlung Berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Caracalla]] from the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin]]
Upon the death of Severus, his sons [[Caracalla]] and [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] were made emperors. During their youth, their squabbles had divided Rome into two factions. In that same year Caracalla had his brother, a youth, assassinated in his mother's arms, and may have murdered 20,000 of Geta's followers. Like his father, Caracalla was warlike. He continued Severus' policy, and gained respect from the legions. Caracalla was a cruel man, and was pursued by the guilt of his brother's murder. He ordered the death of people of his own circle, like his tutor, Cilo, and a friend of his father, [[Papinian]].

Knowing that the citizens of [[Alexandria]] disliked him and were speaking ill of his character, he served a banquet for its notable citizens, after which his soldiers killed all the guests. From the security of the temple of Sarapis, he then directed an in-discriminant slaughter of Alexandria's people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/78*.html] Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', LXXVIII, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Caracalla*.html#ref35] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Life of Caracalla'', VI.&lt;/ref&gt; In 212, he issued the [[Constitutio Antoniniana|Edict of Caracalla]], giving full Roman citizenship to all free men living in the Empire, and at the same time raised the inheritance tax, levied only on Roman citizens, to ten percent. A report that a soothsayer had predicted that the [[Praetorian prefect]] [[Macrinus]] and his son were to rule over the empire was dutifully sent to Caracalla. But the report fell into the hands of Macrinus, who felt he must act or die. Macrinus conspired to have Caracalla assassinated by one of his soldiers during a pilgrimage to the Temple of the Moon in Carrhae, in 217&amp;nbsp;AD.

The incompetent Macrinus, assumed power, but soon removed himself from Rome to the east and Antioch. His brief reign ended in 218, when the youngster Bassianus, high priest of the temple of the Sun at Emesa, and supposedly illegitimate son of Caracalla, was declared Emperor by the disaffected soldiers of Macrinus. Bribes gained Bassianus support from the legionaries and they fought against Macrinus and his Praetorian guards. He adopted the name of Antoninus but history has named him after his Sun god [[Elagabalus]], represented on Earth in the form of a large black stone. Elagabalus was an incompetent and lascivious ruler,&lt;ref name=haywood2 /&gt; who was well known for extreme extravagance, that offended all but his favorites. [[Cassius Dio]], [[Herodian]] and the [[Historia Augusta]] have many accounts about his extravagance. He adopted his cousin, [[Alexander Severus]], as Caesar, grew jealous, and attempted to assassinate him. The Praetorian guard preferred Alexander, murdered Elagabalus, dragged his mutilated corpse through the streets of Rome, and threw it into the Tiber.

Elagabalus was succeeded by his cousin [[Alexander Severus]]. Alexander waged war against many foes, like the revitalized [[Persia]] and German peoples who invaded [[Gaul]]. His losses made the soldiers dissatisfied with the emperor, and some of them killed him during his German campaign, in 235&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Severus_Alexander/3*.html#ref239] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Life of Alexander Severus'', LIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crisis of the Third Century ===
{{main|Crisis of the Third Century}}
[[File:Map of Ancient Rome 271 AD.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|The Roman Empire suffered internal schisms, forming the [[Palmyrene Empire]] and the [[Gallic Empire]]]]

A disastrous scenario emerged after the death of [[Alexander Severus]]: the Roman state was plagued by civil wars, external [[invasion]]s, political chaos, [[Plague of Cyprian|pandemics]] and [[Economic collapse|economic depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.boisestate.edu/westciv/empire/15.shtml |title=Crisis of the Third Century (235–285) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503114611/http://history.boisestate.edu/westciv/empire/15.shtml |archive-date=May 3, 2007 |work=History of Western Civilization |first=E.L. |last=Skip Knox |publisher=[[Boise State University]] |access-date=March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=haywood2 /&gt; The old Roman values had fallen, and [[Mithraism]] and Christianity had begun to spread through the populace. Emperors were no longer men linked with nobility; they usually were born in lower-classes of distant parts of the Empire. These men rose to prominence through military ranks, and became emperors through civil wars.

There were 26 emperors in a 49-year period, a signal of political instability. [[Maximinus Thrax]] was the first ruler of that time, governing for just three years. Others ruled just for a few months, like [[Gordian I]], [[Gordian II]], [[Balbinus]] and [[Hostilian]]. The population and the frontiers were abandoned, since the emperors were mostly concerned with defeating rivals and establishing their power.

The economy also suffered during that epoch. The massive military expenditures from the [[Severan dynasty|Severi]] caused a devaluation of Roman coins. [[Hyperinflation]] came at this time as well. The [[Plague of Cyprian]] broke out in 250 and killed a huge portion of the population.&lt;ref name="Gibbon10"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|editor1-last=Bury|editor1-first=J.B.|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|date=1906|publisher=Fred de Fau and Co.|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/gibbon-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-12-vols|language=English|format=Online version|chapter=Chapter X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 260&amp;nbsp;AD, the provinces of [[Syria Palaestina]], [[Asia Minor]] and [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Egypt]] separated from the rest of the Roman state to form the [[Palmyrene Empire]], ruled by Queen [[Zenobia]] and centered on [[Palmyra]]. In that same year the [[Gallic Empire]] was created by [[Postumus]], retaining [[Roman Britain|Britain]] and [[Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Tyranni_XXX*.html] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', III et XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; These countries separated from Rome after the capture of emperor [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] by the [[Sassanid]]s of [[Persia]], the first Roman ruler to be captured by his enemies; it was a humiliating fact for the Romans.&lt;ref name="Gibbon10"/&gt;

The crisis began to recede during the reigns of [[Claudius Gothicus]] (268–270), who defeated the [[Goths|Gothic]] invaders, and [[Aurelian]] (271–275), who reconquered both the Gallic and Palmyrene Empires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aurelian/2*.html] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Life of Aurelian'', XXXII.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Claudius*.html] ''Historia Augusta'', ''The Life of Claudius'', I.&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis was overcome during the reign of [[Diocletian]].

==Empire – the Dominate==
{{Main|Roman Empire}}

===Diocletian===
[[File:DiocletianusFollis-transparent.png|thumb|A Roman [[follis]] depicting the profile of [[Diocletian]]]]
In 284&amp;nbsp;AD, Diocletian was hailed as Imperator by the eastern army. Diocletian healed the empire from the crisis, by political and economic shifts. A new form of government was established: the [[Tetrarchy]]. The Empire was divided among four emperors, two in the West and two in the East. The first tetrarchs were Diocletian (in the East), [[Maximian]] (in the West), and two junior emperors, [[Galerius]] (in the East) and [[Constantius Chlorus|Flavius Constantius]] (in the West). To adjust the economy, Diocletian made several tax reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#VII] Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'', VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian expelled the Persians who plundered [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and conquered some barbarian tribes with Maximian. He adopted many behaviors of Eastern monarchs, like wearing pearls and golden sandals and robes. Anyone in the presence of the emperor had now to prostrate himself&lt;ref&gt;Joannes Zonaras, ''Epitome: From Diocletian to the death of Galerius''.&lt;/ref&gt; – a common act in the East, but never practiced in Rome before. Diocletian did not use a disguised form of Republic, as the other emperors since [[Augustus]] had done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/dioclet.htm Diocletian (284–305 AD)] by Ralph W. Mathisen. De Imperatoribus Romanis. Written 17 March 1997. Retrieved 20 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 290 and 330, half a dozen new capitals had been established by the members of the Tetrarchy, officially or not: Antioch, Nicomedia, Thessalonike, Sirmium, Milan, and Trier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward-Perkins|first1=John Bryan|title=Roman Imperial Architecture|date=1994|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-05292-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian was also responsible for a significant Christian persecution. In 303 he and [[Galerius]] started the persecution and ordered the destruction of all the Christian churches and scripts and forbade Christian worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#X] Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'', X-XVI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diocletian abdicated in 305&amp;nbsp;AD together with [[Maximian]], thus, he was the first Roman emperor to resign. His reign ended the traditional form of imperial rule, the [[Principate]] (from [[princeps]]) and started the [[Dominate]] (from Dominus, "Master").

=== Constantine and Christianity ===
[[Constantine I|Constantine]] assumed the empire as a tetrarch in 306. He conducted many wars against the other tetrarchs. Firstly he defeated [[Maxentius]] in 312. In 313, he issued the [[Edict of Milan]], which granted liberty for Christians to profess their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|editor1-last=Bury|editor1-first=J.B.|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|date=1906|publisher=Fred de Fau and Co.|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/gibbon-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-12-vols|language=English|format=Online version|chapter=Chapter XX}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine was converted to Christianity, enforcing the Christian faith. He began the Christianization of the Empire and of Europe – a process concluded by the Catholic Church in the [[Middle Ages]].

He was defeated by the [[Franks]] and the [[Alamanni]] during 306–308. In 324 he defeated another tetrarch, [[Licinius]], and controlled all the empire, as it was before [[Diocletian]]. To celebrate his victories and Christianity's relevance, he rebuilt [[Byzantium]] and renamed it Nova Roma ("New Rome"); but the city soon gained the informal name of [[Constantinople]] ("City of Constantine").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|editor1-last=Bury|editor1-first=J.B.|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|date=1906|publisher=Fred de Fau and Co.|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/gibbon-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-12-vols|language=English|format=Online version|chapter=Chapter XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/conniei.htm Constantine I (306 – 337 AD)] by Hans A.

Constantinople served as a new capital for the Empire. In fact, Rome had lost its central importance since the Crisis of the Third Century-–[[Mediolanum]] was the western capital from 286 to 330, until the reign of [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], when [[Ravenna]] was made capital, in the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/honorius.htm Honorius (395–423 AD)] by Ralph W.

Constantine's administrative and monetary reforms, that reunited the Empire under one emperor, and rebuilt the city of Byzantium changed the high period of the [[Classical antiquity|ancient world]].

In the late 4th and 5th centuries the Western Empire entered a critical stage which terminated with the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duiker|first1=William|last2=Spielvogel|first2=Jackson|title=World History|date=2001|publisher=Wadsworth|isbn=0-534-57168-9|page=155|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the last emperors of the [[Constantinian dynasty]] and the [[Valentinian dynasty]], Rome lost decisive battles against the [[Sasanian Empire]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[barbarian]]s: in 363, emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] was killed in the [[Battle of Samarra]], against the Persians and the [[Battle of Adrianople]] cost the life of emperor [[Valens]] (364–378); the victorious [[Goths]] were never expelled from the Empire nor assimilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|editor1-last=Bury|editor1-first=J.B.|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|date=1906|publisher=Fred de Fau and Co.|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/gibbon-the-history-of-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-roman-empire-12-vols|language=English|format=Online version|chapter=Chapter XXVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next emperor, [[Theodosius I]] (379–395), gave even more force to the Christian faith, and after his death, the Empire was divided into the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], ruled by [[Arcadius]] and the [[Western Roman Empire]], commanded by [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], both of which were Theodosius' sons.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The situation became more critical in 408, after the death of [[Stilicho]], a general who tried to reunite the Empire and repel barbarian invasion in the early years of the 5th century. The professional field army collapsed. In 410, the [[Theodosian dynasty]] saw the [[Visigoths]] [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Lapham, Lewis (1997). ''The End of the World.''

The [[Vandals]] conquered [[Vandal Kingdom|North Africa]], the [[Visigoths]] claimed [[Gaul]], [[Hispania]] was taken by the [[Suebi]], [[Roman Britain|Britain]] was abandoned by the central government, and the Empire suffered further from the invasions of [[Attila]], chief of the [[Huns]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/8*.html#ref16] Bury, J.B.: ''History of the Later Roman Empire'', 8, §2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/6*.html#ref82] Bury, J.B.: ''History of the Later Roman Empire'', 6, §4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/6*.html#3] Bury, J.B.: ''History of the Later Roman Empire'', 6, §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/9*.html] Bury, J.B.: ''History of the Later Roman Empire'', 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/firsteuro/invas.html |title=The Germanic Invasions of Western Europe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812103150/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/firsteuro/invas.html |archive-date=August 12, 2013 |work=[[University of Calgary]] |date=August 1996 |access-date=March 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duiker|first1=William|last2=Spielvogel|first2=Jackson|title=World History|date=2001|publisher=Wadsworth|isbn=0-534-57168-9|page=157|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time many [[Paganism|pagans]] argued that Christianity and the decline of traditional Roman religion were responsible; some rationalist thinkers of the modern era attribute the fall to a change from a martial to a more pacifist religion that lessened the number of available soldiers; while Christians such as [[Augustine of Hippo]] argued that the sinful nature of Roman society itself was to blame.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Bishop, The Middle Ages, 1996. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern Empire had a different fate. It survived for almost 1000 years after the fall of its [[Western Roman Empire|Western counterpart]] and became the most stable Christian [[realm]] during the Middle Ages.

=== Class structure ===

Roman society is largely viewed as [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]], with [[slavery in antiquity|slaves]] (''servi'') at the bottom, [[freedman|freedmen]] (''liberti'') above them, and free-born citizens (''cives'') at the top. Free citizens were also divided by class. The broadest, and earliest, division was between the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]], who could trace their ancestry to one of the 100 [[Patriarch]]s at the founding of the city, and the [[plebs|plebeians]], who could not. This became less important in the later Republic, as some plebeian families became wealthy and entered politics, and some patrician families fell economically. Anyone, patrician or plebeian, who could count a consul as his ancestor was a [[nobility|noble]] (''nobilis''); a man who was the first of his family to hold the consulship, such as [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] or [[Cicero]], was known as a ''[[novus homo]]'' ("new man") and ennobled his descendants. Patrician ancestry, however, still conferred considerable prestige, and many religious offices remained restricted to patricians.

A class division originally based on military service became more important. Membership of these classes was determined periodically by the [[Roman censor|Censors]], according to property. The wealthiest were the Senatorial class, who dominated politics and command of the army. Next came the [[Equestrian order|equestrians]] (''equites'', sometimes translated "knights"), originally those who could afford a warhorse, and who formed a powerful mercantile class. Several further classes, originally based on the military equipment their members could afford, followed, with the ''proletarii'', citizens who had no property at all, at the bottom. Before the reforms of Marius they were ineligible for military service and are often described as being just above freed slaves in wealth and prestige.

Voting power in the Republic depended on class. Citizens were enrolled in voting "tribes", but the tribes of the richer classes had fewer members than the poorer ones, all the ''proletarii'' being enrolled in a single tribe. Voting was done in class order, from top down, and stopped as soon as most of the tribes had been reached, so the poorer classes were often unable to cast their votes.

Women shared some basic rights with their male counterparts, but were not fully regarded as citizens and were thus not allowed to vote or take part in politics. At the same time the limited rights of women were gradually expanded (due to [[emancipation]]) and women reached freedom from ''paterfamilias'', gained property rights and even had more juridical rights than their husbands, but still no voting rights, and were absent from politics.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Frost Abbott, ''Society and Politics in Ancient Rome'', BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2009, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Allied foreign cities were often given the [[Latin Right]], an intermediary level between full citizens and foreigners (''peregrini''), which gave their citizens rights under [[Roman law]] and allowed their leading magistrates to become full Roman citizens. While there were varying degrees of Latin rights, the main division was between those ''cum suffragio'' ("with vote"; enrolled in a [[Roman Tribes#The Servian tribes|Roman tribe]] and able to take part in the ''comitia tributa'') and ''sine suffragio'' ("without vote"; could not take part in Roman politics). Most of Rome's Italian allies were given full citizenship after the [[Social War (91–88&amp;nbsp;BC)|Social War]] of 91–88&amp;nbsp;BC, and full [[Roman citizenship]] was extended to all free-born men in the Empire by [[Caracalla]] in 212.

The basic units of Roman society were households and [[Family|families]].&lt;ref name="Duiker346"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duiker|first1=William|last2=Spielvogel|first2=Jackson|title=World History|date=2001|publisher=Wadsworth|isbn=0-534-57168-9|page=146|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; Households included the head (usually the father) of the household, ''[[pater familias]]'' (father of the family), his wife, children, and other relatives. In the upper classes, slaves and servants were also part of the household.&lt;ref name="Duiker346"/&gt; The power of the head of the household was supreme (''patria potestas'', "father's power") over those living with him: He could force marriage (usually for money) and divorce, sell his children into slavery, claim his dependents' property as his own, and even had the right to punish or kill family members (though this last right apparently ceased to be exercised after the 1st century BC).&lt;ref name="Cassonpageset1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casson|first1=Lionel|title=Everyday Life in Ancient Rome|date=1998|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-5992-1|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Patria potestas'' even extended over adult sons with their own households: A man was not considered a ''paterfamilias'', nor could he truly hold property, while his own father lived.&lt;ref name="Cassonpageset1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/1/777777121908/ Family Values in Ancient Rome] by [[Richard Saller]].

Little affection was shown for the [[Children of Ancient Rome|children of Rome]]. The mother or an elderly relative often raised both boys and girls. Unwanted children were often sold as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85Gdul_43DEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=children+of+ancient+rome&amp;ots=GVBH8HaVC3&amp;sig=TxP1CaxmIEhaQOuXbFlQj5cSGF0&amp;q=children%20of%20ancient%20rome|title=The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives|last=Rawson|first=Beryl|date=1987-01-01|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=|isbn=0801494605|location=|pages=2 of introduction|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children might have waited on tables for the family, but they could not have participated in the conversation.

In noble families a Greek nurse usually taught the children Latin and Greek. Their father taught the boys how to swim and ride, although he sometimes hired a slave to teach them instead. At seven, a boy began his education. Having no school building, classes were held on a rooftop (if dark, the boy had to carry a lantern to school). Wax-covered boards were used as paper, papyrus, and parchment were too expensive—or he could just write in the sand. A loaf of bread to be eaten was also carried.&lt;ref&gt;LifepacHistory&amp;Geography, Grade6 Unit 3, page 28.z&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups of related households formed a family (''[[gens]]''). Families were based on blood ties or [[adoption]], but were also political and economic alliances. Especially during the [[Roman Republic]], some powerful families, or ''[[Gens|Gentes Maiores]]'', came to dominate political life.

In ancient Rome, marriage was often regarded more as a financial and political alliance than as a romantic association, especially in the upper classes (see [[marriage in ancient Rome]]). Fathers usually began seeking husbands for their daughters when these reached an age between twelve and fourteen. The husband was usually older than the bride. While upper class girls married very young, there is evidence that lower class women often married in their late teens or early 20s.

Initially, Rome was ruled by [[Roman Kingdom|kings]], who were elected from each of Rome's major tribes in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matyszak|first1=Philip|title=Chronicle of the Roman Republic|date=2003|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=0-500-05121-6|pages=16–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact nature of the king's power is uncertain. He may have held near-absolute power, or may also have merely been the chief executive of the [[SPQR|Senate and the people]]. At least in military matters, the king's authority (''[[Imperium]]'') was likely absolute. He was also the head of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|state religion]]. In addition to the authority of the King, there were three administrative assemblies: the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], which acted as an advisory body for the King; the [[Curiate Assembly|Comitia Curiata]], which could endorse and ratify laws suggested by the King; and the [[Roman assemblies|Comitia Calata]], which was an assembly of the priestly college that could assemble the people to bear witness to certain acts, hear proclamations, and declare the [[Festival|feast]] and holiday schedule for the next month.

[[File:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Representation of a sitting of the [[Roman Senate]]: [[Cicero]] attacks [[Catiline|Catilina]], from a 19th-century fresco]] The [[class struggle]]s of the [[Roman Republic]] resulted in an unusual mixture of democracy and [[oligarchy]]. The word republic comes from the Latin ''res publica'', which literally translates to "public business". [[List of Roman laws|Roman laws]] traditionally could only be passed by a vote of the Popular assembly ([[Tribal Assembly|Comitia Tributa]]). Likewise, candidates for public positions had to run for election by the people. However, the [[Roman Senate]] represented an oligarchic institution, which acted as an advisory body.

In the Republic, the Senate held actual authority (''auctoritas''), but no real legislative power; it was technically only an advisory council. However, as the Senators were individually very influential, it was difficult to accomplish anything against the collective will of the Senate. New Senators were chosen from among the most accomplished [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] by [[Roman censor|Censors]] (''Censura''), who could also remove a Senator from his office if he was found "morally corrupt"; a charge that could include bribery or, as under [[Cato the Elder]], embracing one's wife in public. Later, under the reforms of the dictator [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], [[Quaestor]]s were made automatic members of the Senate, though most of his reforms did not survive.

The Republic had no fixed [[bureaucracy]], and collected taxes through the practice of [[tax farming]]. Government positions such as [[quaestor]], [[aedile]], or [[Prefect|praefect]] were funded by the office-holder. To prevent any citizen from gaining too much power, new [[magistrate]]s were elected annually and had to share power with a colleague. For example, under normal conditions, the highest authority was held by two consuls. In an emergency, a temporary [[Roman dictator|dictator]] could be appointed. Throughout the Republic, the administrative system was revised several times to comply with new demands. In the end, it proved inefficient for controlling the ever-expanding dominion of Rome, contributing to the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]].

In the early Empire, the pretense of a republican form of government was maintained. The [[Roman Emperor]] was portrayed as only a ''[[princeps]]'', or "first citizen", and the Senate gained legislative power and all legal authority previously held by the popular assemblies. However, the rule of the Emperors became increasingly [[Autocracy|autocratic]], and the Senate was reduced to an advisory body appointed by the Emperor. The Empire did not inherit a set bureaucracy from the Republic, since the Republic did not have any permanent governmental structures apart from the Senate. The Emperor appointed assistants and advisers, but the state lacked many institutions, such as a centrally planned [[budget]]. Some historians have cited this as a significant reason for the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].

=== Law ===
{{Main|Roman law}}

The roots of the legal principles and practices of the [[Outline of ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] may be traced to the [[Twelve Tables|Law of the Twelve Tables]] promulgated in 449&amp;nbsp;BC and to the codification of law issued by order of Emperor [[Justinian I]] around 530&amp;nbsp;AD (see [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]). Roman law as preserved in Justinian's codes continued into the [[Byzantine Empire]], and formed the basis of similar codifications in continental Western Europe. Roman law continued, in a broader sense, to be applied throughout most of Europe until the end of the 17th century.

The major divisions of the law of ancient Rome, as contained within the Justinian and Theodosian law codes, consisted of ''Ius Civile'', ''Ius Gentium'', and ''Ius Naturale''. The ''Ius Civile'' ("Citizen Law") was the body of common laws that applied to Roman citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Lesley|last2=Adkins|first2=Roy|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|page=46|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-512332-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Praetor urbanus|''Praetores Urbani'']] (''sg. Praetor Urbanus'') were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens. The ''Ius Gentium'' ("Law of nations") was the body of common laws that applied to foreigners, and their dealings with Roman citizens.&lt;ref name="Duiker346"/&gt; The [[Praetor peregrinus|''Praetores Peregrini'']] (''sg. Praetor Peregrinus'') were the people who had jurisdiction over cases involving citizens and foreigners. ''Ius Naturale'' encompassed natural law, the body of laws that were considered common to all beings.

=== Economy ===

[[File:Trajan's market.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|Night view of [[Trajan's Market]], built by [[Apollodorus of Damascus]]]]

Ancient Rome commanded a vast area of land, with tremendous natural and human resources. As such, Rome's economy remained focused on [[Farming in ancient Rome|farming]] and trade. Agricultural [[free trade]] changed the Italian landscape, and by the 1st century BC, vast grape and [[olive]] estates had supplanted the [[yeoman]] farmers, who were unable to match the imported grain price. The [[annexation]] of [[Egypt]], Sicily and [[Tunisia]] in North Africa provided a continuous supply of grains. In turn, [[olive oil]] and [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] were Italy's main exports. Two-tier [[crop rotation]] was practiced, but farm productivity was low, around 1 ton per hectare.

Industrial and manufacturing activities were smaller. The largest such activities were the mining and [[quarry]]ing of stones, which provided basic construction materials for the buildings of that period. In manufacturing, production was on a relatively small scale, and generally consisted of workshops and small factories that employed at most dozens of workers. However, some brick factories employed hundreds of workers.

The economy of the early Republic was largely based on smallholding and paid labor. However, foreign wars and conquests made [[slavery in antiquity|slaves]] increasingly cheap and plentiful, and by the late Republic, the economy was largely dependent on [[Slavery|slave labor]] for both skilled and unskilled work. Slaves are estimated to have constituted around 20% of the Roman Empire's population at this time and 40% in the city of Rome. Only in the Roman Empire, when the conquests stopped and the prices of slaves increased, did hired labor become more economical than slave ownership.

Although [[barter]] was used in ancient Rome, and often used in tax collection, Rome had a very developed [[coin]]age system, with [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[bronze]], and [[precious metal]] coins in circulation throughout the Empire and beyond—some have even been discovered in [[India]]. Before the 3rd century BC, copper was traded by weight, measured in unmarked lumps, across [[central Italy]]. The original [[British coinage|copper coins]] (''[[As (Roman coin)|as]]'') had a face value of one [[Pound (weight)#Origins|Roman pound]] of copper, but weighed less. Thus, Roman money's utility as a unit of exchange consistently exceeded its [[Intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]] as metal.

The early Roman army (c. 500&amp;nbsp;BC) was, like those of other contemporary [[city-state]]s influenced by Greek civilization, a citizen ''[[militia]]'' that practiced [[hoplite]] tactics. It was small (the population of free men of military age was then about 9,000) and organized in five classes (in parallel to the ''[[Roman assemblies|comitia centuriata]]'', the body of citizens organized politically), with three providing hoplites and two providing light infantry. The early Roman army was tactically limited and its stance during this period was essentially defensive.&lt;ref name=keegan263&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keegan|first1=John|title=A History of Warfare|date=1993|publisher=Alfred A.

Knopf (New York 1989) {{ISBN|0-394-57188-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 3rd century BC, the Romans abandoned the hoplite formation in favor of a more flexible system in which smaller groups of 120 (or sometimes 60) men called ''[[Maniple (military unit)|maniples]]'' could maneuver more independently on the battlefield. Thirty maniples arranged in three lines with supporting troops constituted a [[Roman legion|legion]], totalling between 4,000 and 5,000 men.&lt;ref name=keegan263 /&gt;&lt;ref name= potter/&gt;

The early Republican legion consisted of five sections, each of which was equipped differently and had different places in formation: the three lines of manipular heavy infantry (''[[hastati]]'', ''[[principes]]'' and ''[[triarii]])'', a force of light infantry (''[[velites]]''), and the cavalry (''[[equites]]''). With the new organization came a new orientation toward the offensive and a much more aggressive posture toward adjoining city-states.&lt;ref name=keegan263 /&gt;&lt;ref name= potter/&gt;

At nominal full strength, an early Republican legion included 4,000 to 5,000 men: 3,600 to 4,800 heavy infantry, several hundred light infantry, and several hundred cavalrymen.&lt;ref name=keegan263 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=The Roman Army at War 100BC-AD200|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-815057-1|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jo-Ann Shelton, ed., ''As the Romans Did: A Sourcebook in Roman Social History'', Oxford University Press (New York 1998){{ISBN|0-19-508974-X}}, pp. 245–249.&lt;/ref&gt; Legions were often significantly understrength from recruitment failures or following periods of active service due to accidents, battle casualties, disease and desertion. During the Civil War, Pompey's legions in the east were at full strength because they were recently recruited, while Caesar's legions were often well below nominal strength after long active service in Gaul. This pattern also held true for auxiliary forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=The Complete Roman Army|date=2003|publisher=Thames and Hudson, Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-500-05124-0|pages=22–24, 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=Caesar: Life of a Colossus|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|location=U.K.|isbn=0300126891|pages=384, 410–411, 425–427}} Another important factor discussed by Goldsworthy was absence of legionaries on detached duty.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the late Republican period, the typical legionary was a property-owning citizen farmer from a rural area (an ''adsiduus'') who served for particular (often annual) campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;Between 343BC and 241BC, the Roman army fought every year except for five. {{cite book|last1=Oakley|first1=Stephen P.|editor1-last=Flower|editor1-first=Harriet I.|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=0-521-00390-3|page=27|chapter=The Early Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who supplied his own equipment and, in the case of ''equites'', his own mount. Harris suggests that down to 200&amp;nbsp;BC, the average rural farmer (who survived) might participate in six or seven campaigns. Freedmen and slaves (wherever resident) and urban citizens did not serve except in rare emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Brunt, "Army and Land in the Roman Republic," in ''The Fall of the Roman Republic and Related Essays'', Oxford University Press (Oxford 1988) {{ISBN|0-19-814849-6}}, p. 253; William V. Harris, ''War and Imperialism in Republican Rome 327–70&amp;nbsp;BC'', Oxford University Press (Oxford 1979) {{ISBN|0-19-814866-6}}, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 200&amp;nbsp;BC, economic conditions in rural areas deteriorated as manpower needs increased, so that the property qualifications for service were gradually reduced. Beginning with [[Gaius Marius]] in 107&amp;nbsp;BC, citizens without property and some urban-dwelling citizens (''proletarii'') were enlisted and provided with equipment, although most legionaries continued to come from rural areas. Terms of service became continuous and long—up to twenty years if emergencies required although six- or seven-year terms were more typical.&lt;ref name="keegan273"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keegan|first1=John|title=A History of Warfare|date=1993|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-394-58801-0|pages=273–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 3rd century BC, legionaries were paid ''stipendium'' (amounts are disputed but Caesar famously "doubled" payments to his troops to 225 [[Denarius|''denarii'']] a year), could anticipate booty and donatives (distributions of plunder by commanders) from successful campaigns and, beginning at the time of Marius, often were granted allotments of land upon retirement.&lt;ref name=keegan263 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunt, pp. 259–265; Potter, pp. 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; Cavalry and light infantry attached to a legion (the ''auxilia'') were often recruited in the areas where the legion served. Caesar formed a legion, the Fifth Alaudae, from non-citizens in Transalpine Gaul to serve in his campaigns in Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=Caesar: Life of a Colossus|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|location=U.K.|isbn=0300126891|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Caesar Augustus, the ideal of the citizen-soldier had been abandoned and the legions had become fully professional. Legionaries received 900 [[Sestertius|''sesterces'']] a year and could expect 12,000 ''sesterces'' on retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Christ, ''The Romans'', University of California Press (Berkeley, 1984){{ISBN|0-520-04566-1}}, pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[Final War of the Roman Republic|Civil War]], Augustus reorganized Roman military forces, discharging soldiers and disbanding legions. He retained 28 legions, distributed through the provinces of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackay|first1=Christopher S.|title=Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-80918-5|pages=249–250}}Mackay points out that the number of legions (not necessarily the number of legionaries) grew to 30 by 125AD and 33 during the [[Severan dynasty|Severan]] period (200–235AD).&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Principate]], the tactical organization of the Army continued to evolve. The ''auxilia'' remained independent cohorts, and legionary troops often operated as groups of cohorts rather than as full legions. A new versatile type of unit &amp;nbsp;- the ''cohortes equitatae'' – combined cavalry and legionaries in a single formation. They could be stationed at garrisons or outposts and could fight on their own as balanced small forces or combine with other similar units as a larger legion-sized force. This increase in organizational flexibility helped ensure the long-term success of Roman military forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=The Roman Army at War 100BC-AD200|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-815057-1|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emperor [[Gallienus]] (253–268&amp;nbsp;AD) began a reorganization that created the last military structure of the late Empire. Withdrawing some legionaries from the fixed bases on the border, Gallienus created mobile forces (the ''[[Comitatenses]]'' or field armies) and stationed them behind and at some distance from the borders as a strategic reserve. The border troops (''limitanei'') stationed at fixed bases continued to be the first line of defense. The basic unit of the field army was the "regiment", ''legiones'' or ''auxilia'' for infantry and ''vexellationes'' for cavalry. Evidence suggests that nominal strengths may have been 1,200 men for infantry regiments and 600 for cavalry, although many records show lower actual troop levels (800 and 400).&lt;ref name="Hugh Elton 1996 pp. 89-96"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elton|first1=Hugh|title=Warfare in Roman Europe AD350-425|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-815241-8|pages=89–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many infantry and cavalry regiments operated in pairs under the command of a ''[[comes]]''. In addition to Roman troops, the field armies included regiments of "barbarians" recruited from allied tribes and known as ''[[foederati]]''. By 400&amp;nbsp;AD, ''foederati'' regiments had become permanently established units of the Roman army, paid and equipped by the Empire, led by a Roman tribune and used just as Roman units were used. In addition to the ''foederati'', the Empire also used groups of barbarians to fight along with the legions as "allies" without integration into the field armies. Under the command of the senior Roman general present, they were led at lower levels by their own officers.&lt;ref name="Hugh Elton 1996 pp. 89-96"/&gt;

Military leadership evolved over the course of the history of Rome. Under the monarchy, the hoplite armies were led by the kings of Rome. During the early and middle Roman Republic, military forces were under the command of one of the two elected [[Roman consul|consuls]] for the year. During the later Republic, members of the Roman Senatorial elite, as part of the normal sequence of elected public offices known as the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', would have served first as ''[[quaestor]]'' (often posted as deputies to field commanders), then as ''[[praetor]]''.&lt;ref name="bcorrey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brennan|first1=Correy T.|editor1-last=Flower|editor1-first=Harriet I.|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=0-521-00390-3|pages=66–68|chapter=Power and Process Under the Republican 'Constitution'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=The Roman Army at War 100BC-AD200|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-815057-1|pages=121–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Caesar's most talented, effective and reliable subordinate in Gaul, [[Titus Labienus]], was recommended to him by [[Pompey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsworthy|first1=Adrian|title=The Roman Army at War 100BC-AD200|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-815057-1|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3bis.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|[[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus]], c. 122 BC; the altar shows two Roman infantrymen equipped with long ''[[Scutum (shield)|scuta]]'' and a cavalryman with his horse. All are shown wearing [[chain mail]] armour.]]
Following the end of a term as praetor or consul, a Senator might be appointed by the Senate as a [[Promagistrate|''propraetor'']] or [[Promagistrate|''proconsul'']] (depending on the highest office held before) to govern a foreign province. More junior officers (down to but not including the level of centurion) were selected by their commanders from their own ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|clientelae]]'' or those recommended by political allies among the Senatorial elite.&lt;ref name="bcorrey" /&gt;

Under Augustus, whose most important political priority was to place the military under a permanent and unitary command, the Emperor was the legal commander of each legion but exercised that command through a ''[[legatus]]'' (legate) he appointed from the Senatorial elite. In a province with a single legion, the legate commanded the legion (''[[legatus legionis]]'') and also served as provincial governor, while in a province with more than one legion, each legion was commanded by a legate and the legates were commanded by the provincial governor (also a legate but of higher rank).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackay|first1=Christopher S.|title=Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-80918-5|pages=245–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the later stages of the Imperial period (beginning perhaps with [[Diocletian]]), the Augustan model was abandoned. Provincial governors were stripped of military authority, and command of the armies in a group of provinces was given to generals ([[Dux|''duces'']]) appointed by the Emperor. These were no longer members of the Roman elite but men who came up through the ranks and had seen much practical soldiering. With increasing frequency, these men attempted (sometimes successfully) to usurp the positions of the Emperors who had appointed them. Decreased resources, increasing political chaos and civil war eventually left the Western Empire vulnerable to attack and takeover by neighboring barbarian peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mackay|first1=Christopher S.|title=Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-80918-5|pages=295–296}}. Also chapters 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less is known about the [[Roman navy]] than the Roman army. Prior to the middle of the 3rd century BC, officials known as ''duumviri navales'' commanded a fleet of twenty ships used mainly to control piracy. This fleet was given up in 278&amp;nbsp;AD and replaced by allied forces. The [[Punic Wars|First Punic War]] required that Rome build large fleets, and it did so largely with the assistance of and financing from allies. This reliance on allies continued to the end of the Roman Republic. The [[quinquereme]] was the main warship on both sides of the Punic Wars and remained the mainstay of Roman naval forces until replaced by the time of Caesar Augustus by lighter and more maneuverable vessels.&lt;ref name="Potter pp. 76-78"&gt;This paragraph is based upon Potter, pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

As compared with a [[trireme]], the quinquereme permitted the use of a mix of experienced and inexperienced crewmen (an advantage for a primarily land-based power), and its lesser maneuverability permitted the Romans to adopt and perfect [[Corvus (weapon)|boarding tactics]] using a troop of about 40 marines in lieu of the [[Naval tactics in the Age of Galleys|ram]]. Ships were commanded by a ''[[navarch]]'', a rank equal to a centurion, who was usually not a citizen. Potter suggests that because the fleet was dominated by non-Romans, the navy was considered non-Roman and allowed to atrophy in times of peace.&lt;ref name="Potter pp. 76-78"/&gt;

Information suggests that by the time of the late Empire (350&amp;nbsp;AD), the Roman navy comprised several fleets including warships and merchant vessels for transportation and supply. Warships were oared sailing galleys with three to five banks of oarsmen. Fleet bases included such ports as Ravenna, Arles, Aquilea, Misenum and the mouth of the Somme River in the West and Alexandria and Rhodes in the East. Flotillas of small river craft (''classes'') were part of the ''limitanei'' (border troops) during this period, based at fortified river harbors along the Rhine and the Danube. That prominent generals commanded both armies and fleets suggests that naval forces were treated as auxiliaries to the army and not as an independent service. The details of command structure and fleet strengths during this period are not well known, although fleets were commanded by prefects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elton|first1=Hugh|title=Warfare in Roman Europe AD350-425|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-815241-8|pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life in ancient Rome revolved around the city of Rome, located on [[Seven hills of Rome|seven hills]]. The city had a vast number of [[monument]]al structures like the [[Colosseum]], the [[Trajan's Forum|Forum of Trajan]] and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. It had [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]], [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]], marketplaces, functional sewers, [[thermae|bath complexes]] complete with libraries and shops, and fountains with fresh drinking water supplied by hundreds of miles of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]]. Throughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome, residential architecture ranged from modest houses to [[Roman villa|country villas]].

In the capital city of Rome, there were [[Roman Empire|imperial]] [[House|residences]] on the elegant [[Palatine Hill]], from which the word ''palace'' derives. The low [[Plebs|Plebeian]] and middle [[Equestrian order|Equestrian]] classes lived in the city center, packed into apartments, or [[Insulae]], which were almost like modern [[ghetto]]s. These areas, often built by upper class property owners to rent, were often centred upon [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegia]] or [[taberna]]. These people, provided with a [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|free supply of grain]], and entertained by [[Gladiator|gladatorial games]], were enrolled as [[Patronage in ancient Rome|clients of patrons]] among the upper class [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patricians]], whose assistance they sought and whose interests they upheld.

Archaic [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], at least concerning the gods, was made up not of written [[narrative]]s, but rather of complex interrelations between gods and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matyszak|first1=Philip|title=Chronicle of the Roman Republic|date=2003|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=0-500-05121-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in [[Greek mythology]], the gods were not personified, but were vaguely defined sacred spirits called ''[[Numen|numina]]''. Romans also believed that every person, place or thing had its own ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'', or divine soul. During the [[Roman Republic]], [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] was organized under a strict system of priestly offices, which were held by men of senatorial rank. The College of Pontifices was uppermost body in this hierarchy, and its chief priest, the ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'', was the head of the state religion. [[Flamen]]s took care of the cults of various gods, while [[augur]]s were trusted with taking the [[auspice]]s. The [[Rex Sacrorum|sacred king]] took on the religious responsibilities of the deposed kings. In the Roman Empire, emperors were deified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Gibbon|title=The history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HvIbFyM1s54C&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=1787|publisher=printed for J.

As contact with the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] increased, the old [[Roman mythology|Roman gods]] became increasingly associated with [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek gods]].&lt;ref name="willis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willis|first1=Roy|title=World Mythology: The Illustrated Guide|date=2000|publisher=Ken Fin Books|location=Victoria|isbn=1-86458-089-5|pages=166–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] was perceived to be the same deity as [[Zeus]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] became associated with [[Ares]], and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] with [[Poseidon]].

Beginning with Emperor [[Nero]] in the 1st century AD, Roman official policy towards Christianity was negative, and at some points, simply being a Christian could be punishable by death. Under Emperor [[Diocletian]], the [[persecution of Christians]] reached its peak. However, it became an officially supported religion in the Roman state under Diocletian's successor, [[Constantine I]], with the signing of the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, and quickly became dominant. All religions except Christianity were prohibited in 391&amp;nbsp;AD by an edict of Emperor [[Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/theo1.htm Theodosius I (379–395 AD)] by David Woods.

Roman painting styles show [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] influences, and surviving examples are primarily [[fresco]]es used to adorn the walls and ceilings of country [[villa]]s, though [[Latin literature|Roman literature]] includes mentions of paintings on wood, [[ivory]], and other materials.&lt;ref name="adkins3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Lesley|last2=Adkins|first2=Roy|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|pages=350–352|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-512332-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MetstuffonRpaint&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropt/hd_ropt.htm Roman Painting] from Timeline of Art History. Department of Greek and Roman Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Written 2004–10. Retrieved 22 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Several examples of Roman painting have been found at [[Pompeii]], and from these [[History of art|art historians]] divide the history of Roman painting into four periods. The first style of Roman painting was practiced from the early 2nd century BC to the early- or mid-1st century BC. It was mainly composed of imitations of [[marble]] and [[masonry]], though sometimes including depictions of mythological characters.

The second style of Roman painting began during the early 1st century BC, and attempted to depict realistically three-dimensional architectural features and landscapes. The third style occurred during the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– 14&amp;nbsp;AD), and rejected the [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] of the second style in favor of simple ornamentation. A small architectural scene, landscape, or abstract design was placed in the center with a [[wikt:monochrome|monochrome]] background. The fourth style, which began in the 1st century AD, depicted scenes from mythology, while retaining architectural details and abstract patterns.

Portrait sculpture during the period{{Which|date=September 2014}} utilized youthful and classical proportions, evolving later into a mixture of realism and [[idealism]]. During the [[Antonines|Antonine]] and [[Severan dynasty|Severan]] periods, ornate hair and bearding, with deep cutting and drilling, became popular. Advancements were also made in [[Relief|relief sculptures]], usually depicting Roman victories.

[[Latin literature]] was, from its start, influenced heavily by Greek authors. Some of the earliest extant works are of historical [[Epic poetry|epics]] telling the early military history of Rome. As the Republic expanded, authors began to produce poetry, comedy, history, and [[tragedy]].

[[Music of ancient Rome|Roman music]] was largely based on [[Music of ancient Greece|Greek music]], and played an important part in many aspects of Roman life.&lt;ref name=iClassics&gt;{{cite book|author1=Donald Jay Grout|author2=Claude V. Palisca|title=A history of western music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ise5AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=June 1988|publisher=Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]], musical instruments such as the ''[[wikt:tuba#Latin|tuba]]'' (a long trumpet) or the ''cornu'' (similar to a [[French horn]]) were used to give various commands, while the ''bucina'' (possibly a trumpet or [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]) and the ''lituus'' (probably an elongated J-shaped instrument), were used in ceremonial capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Lesley|last2=Adkins|first2=Roy|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|page=89|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-512332-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music was used in the [[Amphitheatre|amphitheaters]] between fights and in the ''[[odeon (building)|odea]]'', and in these settings is known to have featured the ''cornu'' and the ''[[hydraulis]]'' (a type of water organ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Lesley|last2=Adkins|first2=Roy|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|pages=349–350|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-512332-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most religious rituals featured musical performances, with ''tibiae'' (double pipes) at sacrifices, [[cymbal]]s and [[Tambourine]]s at [[orgy|orgiastic]] [[Cult (religious practice)|cults]], and [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] and [[hymns]] across the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adkins|first1=Lesley|last2=Adkins|first2=Roy|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|page=300|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-512332-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some music historians believe that music was used at almost all public ceremonies.&lt;ref name=iClassics/&gt; Music historians are not certain if Roman musicians made a significant contribution to the [[Music theory|theory]] or practice of music.&lt;ref name=iClassics/&gt;

The [[graffiti]], [[brothel]]s, paintings, and sculptures found in [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] suggest that the Romans had a sex-saturated culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Michael|title=Cities of Vesuvius: Pompeii and Herculaneum|date=2005|publisher=Phoenix Press|location=London|isbn=1-898800-45-6|pages=130–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Ancient Roman cuisine}}

Ancient Roman cuisine changed over the long duration of this ancient civilization. Dietary habits were affected by the influence of Greek culture, the political changes from kingdom to republic to empire, and empire's enormous expansion, which exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. In the beginning the differences between social classes were relatively small, but disparities evolved with the empire's growth. Men and women drank wine with their meals, a tradition that has been carried through to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=uaRl9ZUtBYkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=cuisine+of+ancient+rome&amp;ots=yWvgNCNgVX&amp;sig=DLM2X9j3BGEBsEp37hzO8uutdyY&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;q=cuisine%20of%20ancient%20rome|title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People|last=Civitello|first=Linda|date=2011-03-29|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470403716|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The youth of Rome had several forms of athletic play and exercise, such as [[jumping]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], and [[racing]].&lt;ref name=Cassononsports&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casson|first1=Lionel|title=Everyday Life in Ancient Rome|date=1998|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-5992-1|pages=98–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the countryside, pastimes for the wealthy also included fishing and hunting.&lt;ref name=SPQRonline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/26602/entertainment.htm#leisure |title=Daily Life: Entertainment |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430025620/http://library.thinkquest.org/26602/entertainment.htm |archive-date=April 30, 2007 |work=SPQR Online |year=1998 |access-date=April 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans also had several forms of ball playing, including one resembling [[American handball|handball]].&lt;ref name=Cassononsports/&gt; [[Dice game]]s, [[board game]]s, and [[Gambling|gamble games]] were popular pastimes.&lt;ref name=Cassononsports/&gt; Women did not take part in these activities. For the wealthy, dinner parties presented an opportunity for entertainment, sometimes featuring music, dancing, and poetry readings.&lt;ref name=adkins3/&gt; [[Plebeians]] sometimes enjoyed similar parties through clubs or associations, but for most Romans, recreational dining usually meant patronizing [[tavern]]s.&lt;ref name=adkins3/&gt; Children entertained themselves with toys and such games as [[leapfrog]].&lt;ref name=SPQRonline/&gt;&lt;ref name=adkins3/&gt;

Public games were sponsored by leading Romans who wished to advertise their generosity and court popular approval; in the Imperial era, this usually meant the emperor. Several venues were developed specifically for public games. The [[Colisseum]] was built in the Imperial era to host, among other events, [[gladiator]]ial combats. These combats had begun as funeral games around the 4th century BC, and became popular spectator events in the late Republic and Empire. Gladiators had an exotic and inventive variety of arms and armour. They sometimes fought to the death, but more often to an adjudicated victory, dependent on a referee's decision. The outcome was usually in keeping with the mood of the watching crowd. Shows of exotic animals were popular in their own right; but sometimes animals were pitted against human beings, either armed professionals or unarmed criminals who had been condemned to a spectacular and theatrical public death in the arena. Some of these encounters were based on episodes from Roman or Greek mythology.

[[Chariot racing]] was extremely popular among all classes. In Rome, these races were usually held at the [[Circus Maximus]], which had been purpose-built for chariot and horse-racing and, as Rome's largest public place, was also used for festivals and animal shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/circusmaximus/circusmaximus.html Circus Maximus]. Encyclopedia Romana. University of Chicago. Retrieved 19 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It could seat around 150,000 people;&lt;ref&gt;John Humphrey, ''Roman circuses: arenas for chariot racing'', University of California Press, 1986, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; The charioteers raced in teams, identified by their colours. The track was divided lengthwise by a barrier that contained obelisks, temples, statues and lap-counters. The best seats were at the track-side, close to the action; they were reserved for Senators. Behind them sat the [[equites]] (knights), and behind the knights were the [[plebs]] (commoners) and non-citizens. The donor of the games sat on a high platform in the stands alongside images of the gods, visible to all. Large sums were bet on the outcomes of races. Some Romans offered prayers and sacrifices on behalf of their favourites, or laid [[curse tablets|curses]] on the opposing teams, and some aficionados were members of extremely, even violently partisan circus factions.

===Ethics and morality===
Like many ancient cultures, concepts of ethics and morality, while sharing some commonalities with modern society, differed greatly in several important ways. Because ancient civilizations like Rome were under constant threat of attack from marauding tribes, their culture was necessarily militaristic with martial skills being a prized attribute.&lt;ref name="HuffPo: Bread"&gt;{{cite news | title=Bread and Circuses in Rome and America | author=Astore, William | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-astore/bread-and-circuses-in-rom_b_3414248.html | accessdate=August 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas modern societies consider [[compassion]] a virtue, Roman society considered compassion a vice, a moral defect. Indeed, one of the primary purposes of the gladiatorial games was to inoculate Roman citizens from this weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Annual Editions: Western Civilization | volume=1 | edition=12 | publisher=McGraw-Hill/Dushkin | year=2002 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87_ImL1ryQ8C | page=68 | quote=... where compassion was regarded as a moral defect ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo: Bread"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Look Back to Get Ahead: Life Lessons from History's Heroes | author=Jackson, Michael Anthony | publisher=Arcade Publishing | year=2004| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkU9IuW1IuAC | page=174 | quote=Gladatorial games were popular because the Romans actually believed that compassion was a vice and a weakness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romans instead prized virtues such as courage and conviction (''virtus''), a sense of duty to one's people, moderation and avoiding excess (''moderatio''), forgiveness and understanding (''clementia''), fairness (''severitas''), and loyalty (''pietas'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Daily Life in Ancient Rome: A Sourcebook | editor=Harvey, Brian K. | publisher=Hackett Publishing Company | year=2016 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agyhCwAAQBAJ | pages=21–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular descriptions, Roman society had well-established and restrictive norms related to sexuality, though as with many societies, the lion's share of the responsibilities fell on women. Women were generally expected to be monogamous having only a single husband during their life (''univira''), though this was much less regarded by the elite, especially under the empire. Women were expected to be modest in public avoiding any provocative appearance and to demonstrate absolute fidelity to their husbands (''pudicitia''). Indeed, wearing a veil was a common expectation to preserve modesty. Sex outside of marriage was generally frowned upon for men and women and indeed was made illegal during the imperial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Sexual Morality in Ancient Rome | author=Langlands, Rebecca | year=2006 | publisher=Cambridge University Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBLnttutuOMC | pages=3–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, prostitution was seen entirely differently and indeed was an accepted and regulated practice.&lt;ref name=Dillon&gt;{{cite book | author=Mathew Dillon and Lynda Garland| title=Ancient Rome: From the Early Republic to the Assassination of Julius Caesar | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qMNL0jqhygoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ISBN9780415224598&amp;ei=gGEdU-zuNMnslAWli4HwAw&amp;redir_esc=y | ISBN=9780415224598 |page= 382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Pont du Gard]] in France is a [[Roman aqueduct]] built in c. 19&amp;nbsp;BC. It is a [[World Heritage Site]].]]
Ancient Rome boasted impressive technological feats, using many advancements that were lost in the [[Middle Ages]] and not rivaled again until the 19th and 20th centuries. An example of this is [[insulated glazing]], which was not invented again until the 1930s. Many practical Roman innovations were adopted from earlier Greek designs. Advancements were often divided and based on craft. [[trade (profession)|Artisans]] guarded technologies as [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Roman laws protected against a person corrupting slaves to obtain secrets about the master's arts. {{cite book|last1=Zeidman|first1=Bob|title=The Software IP Detective's Handbook: : Measurement, Comparison, and Infringement Detection|date=2011|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0137035330|page=103|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman engineering|Roman civil engineering]] and [[Roman military engineering|military engineering]] constituted a large part of Rome's technological superiority and legacy, and contributed to the construction of hundreds of roads, bridges, [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]], [[public bathing|baths]], theaters and [[arena]]s. Many monuments, such as the [[Colosseum]], [[Pont du Gard]], and [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], remain as testaments to Roman engineering and culture.

The Romans were renowned for their [[Roman architecture|architecture]], which is grouped with Greek traditions into "[[Classical architecture]]". Although there were many differences from [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]], Rome borrowed heavily from Greece in adhering to strict, formulaic building designs and proportions. Aside from two new [[classical order|orders]] of columns, [[composite order|composite]] and [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], and from the [[dome]], which was derived from the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[arch]], Rome had relatively few architectural innovations until the end of the Republic.

[[File:RomaViaAppiaAntica03.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|right|The [[Appian Way]] (''Via Appia''), a road connecting the city of Rome to the southern parts of [[Italy]], remains usable even today]]
In the 1st century BC, Romans started to use [[Roman concrete|concrete]] widely. Concrete was invented in the late 3rd century BC. It was a powerful cement derived from [[pozzolana]], and soon supplanted [[marble]] as the chief Roman building material and allowed many daring architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Winter, Thomas|date=1979-01-01|title=ROMAN CONCRETE: THE ASCENT, SUMMIT, AND DECLINE OF AN ART|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/classicsfacpub/1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1st century BC, [[Vitruvius]] wrote ''[[De architectura]]'', possibly the first complete treatise on architecture in history. In the late 1st century BC, Rome also began to use [[glassblowing]] soon after its invention in [[Syria]] about 50&amp;nbsp;BC. [[Mosaic]]s took the Empire by storm after samples were retrieved during [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]'s campaigns in Greece.

With solid foundations and good drainage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roman road system|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/Roman-road-system|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman roads]] were known for their durability and many segments of the Roman road system were still in use a thousand years after the fall of Rome. The construction of a vast and efficient travel network throughout the Empire dramatically increased Rome's power and influence. They allowed [[Roman legion]]s to be deployed rapidly, with predictable marching times between key points of the empire, no matter the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keegan|first1=John|title=A History of Warfare|date=1993|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-394-58801-0|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; These highways also had enormous economic significance, solidifying Rome's role as a trading crossroads—the origin of the saying "all roads lead to Rome". The Roman government maintained a system of way stations, known as the [[cursus publicus]], that provided refreshments to couriers at regular intervals along the roads and established a system of horse relays allowing a dispatch to travel up to {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} a day.

The Romans constructed numerous [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] to supply water to cities and industrial sites and to aid in [[Roman agriculture|their agriculture]]. By the third century, the city of Rome was supplied by [[List of aqueducts in the city of Rome|11 aqueducts]] with a combined length of {{convert|450|km|0|abbr=on}}. Most aqueducts were constructed below the surface, with only small portions above ground supported by arches.&lt;ref name="HDCLA Aqueduct"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Peck |editor-first=Harry Thurston |editor-link=Harry Thurston Peck |title=[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities]] |date=1963 |entry=Aquae Ductus |pages=104–106 |location=New York |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Cooper Square Publishers, Inc.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB11Aqueduct&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Chisholm |editor-first=Hugh |author-last1=Murray |author-first1=Alexander Stuart |authorlink1=Alexander Stuart Murray |author-last2=Mitchell |author-first2=John Malcolm |authorlink2= |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |entry=Aqueduct |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri02chisrich#page/240/mode/2up/search/aqueduct |date=1911 |edition=11th |volume=2 |pages=240–244 |access-date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, where valleys deeper than {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=on}} had to be crossed, [[inverted siphon]]s were used to convey water across a valley.{{ref|waterhistory}}

The Romans also made major advancements in [[sanitation]]. Romans were particularly famous for their public [[bathing|baths]], called ''[[thermae]]'', which were used for both hygienic and social purposes. Many Roman houses came to have [[flush toilet]]s and [[Tap water|indoor plumbing]], and a complex [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]] system, the ''[[Cloaca Maxima]]'', was used to drain the local [[marsh]]es and carry waste into the Tiber river.

Some historians have speculated that lead pipes in the sewer and plumbing systems led to widespread [[lead poisoning]], which contributed to the decline in [[birth rate]] and general decay of Roman society leading up to the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. However, lead content would have been minimized because the flow of water from aqueducts could not be shut off; it ran continuously through public and private outlets into the drains, and only a few taps were in use.&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply'' by A.T. Hodge (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have raised similar objections to this theory, also pointing out that Roman water pipes were thickly coated with deposits that would have prevented lead from leaching into the water.&lt;ref name=Grout2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html |title=Lead Poisoning and Rome |first=James |last=Grout |publisher=University of Chicago |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60N6AQZTk?url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html |archivedate=22 July 2011 |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
{{Main|Roman historiography}}
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}

Although there has been a diversity of works on ancient Roman history, many of them are lost. As a result of this loss, there are gaps in Roman history, which are filled by unreliable works, such as the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' and other books from obscure authors. However, there remains a number of reliable accounts of Roman history.

===In Roman times===
The first historians used their works for the lauding of Roman culture and customs. By the end of Republic, some historians distorted their histories to flatter their patrons—especially at the time of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]]'s and [[Sulla]]'s clash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html] Plutarch, ''Parallel Lives'', ''Life of Marius'', XI, 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] wrote his own histories to make a complete account of his military campaigns in [[Gaul]] and during the [[Caesar's Civil War|Civil War]].

In the Empire, the biographies of famous men and early emperors flourished, examples being ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' of Suetonius, and Plutarch's ''[[Parallel Lives]]''. Other major works of Imperial times were that of Livy and Tacitus.
* [[Polybius]] – ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]''
* [[Sallust]] – ''[[Catiline|Bellum Catilinae]]'' and ''[[Jugurthine War|Bellum Jugurthinum]]''
* [[Julius Caesar]] – ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' and ''[[De Bello Civili]]''
* [[Livy]] – ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]''
* [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] – ''Roman Antiquities''
* [[Pliny the Elder]] – ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''
* [[Josephus]] – ''[[The Jewish War]]''
* [[Suetonius]] – ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' (''De Vita Caesarum'')
* [[Tacitus]] – ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]]'' and ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]''
* [[Plutarch]] – ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' (a series of biographies of famous Roman and Greek men)
* [[Cassius Dio]] – ''Historia Romana''
* [[Herodian]] – ''History of the Roman Empire since Marcus Aurelius''
* [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] – ''Res Gestae''

===In modern times===
{{History of Italy}}
Interest in studying, and even idealizing, ancient Rome became prevalent during the [[Italian Renaissance]], and continues until the present day. [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Charles Montesquieu]] wrote a work ''Reflections on the Causes of the Grandeur and Declension of the Romans''. The first major work was ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' by [[Edward Gibbon]], which encompassed the Roman civilization from the end of the 2nd century to the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453.&lt;ref name="Gibbon2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, 12 vols.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Montesquieu, Gibbon paid tribute to the virtue of Roman citizens. [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] was a founder of the examination of ancient Roman history and wrote ''The Roman History'', tracing the period until the [[First Punic War|First Punic war]]. Niebuhr tried to determine the way the Roman tradition evolved. According to him, Romans, like other people, had an historical [[ethos]] preserved mainly in the noble families.

During the [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] period a work titled ''The History of Romans'' by [[Victor Duruy]] appeared. It highlighted the [[Julius Caesar|Caesarean]] period popular at the time. ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'', ''[[Roman constitutional law]]'' and ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', all by [[Theodor Mommsen]],&lt;ref name="kirjasto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mommsen.htm |title=Theodor Mommsen |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824083420/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mommsen.htm |archivedate=24 August 2014 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; became very important milestones. Later the work ''Greatness and Decline of Rome'' by [[Guglielmo Ferrero]] was published. The Russian work ''Очерки по истории римского землевладения, преимущественно в эпоху Империи'' (''The Outlines on Roman Landownership History, Mainly During the Empire'') by Ivan Grevs contained information on the economy of [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Pomponius Atticus]], one of the largest landowners at the end of the Republic.

[[Image:Animhorse.gif|right|thumb|200px|A horse animated by [[rotoscoping]] from  [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos. The animation consists of 8 drawings, which are "looped", i.e. repeated over and over.]]
An '''animated cartoon''' is a [[film]] for the [[movie theater|cinema]], [[television]] or computer screen, which is made using sequential [[drawing]]s, as opposed to [[animation]] in general, which include films made using [[clay animation|clay]], [[puppet]]s, [[3D modeling]] and other means. Animated cartoons are still created for entertainment, commercial, educational{{sfn|Dalacostaa|2009|p=1}} and personal purposes.

==History==
{{main|History of animation}}

===Early years===
Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of [[motion (physics)|motion]] into a still drawing can be found in [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s, where animals are often depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions, clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion.{{sfn|Thomas|1958|p=8}}

A 5,200-year old pottery bowl discovered in [[Shahr-e Sukhteh]], [[Iran]], has five sequential images painted around it that seem to show phases of a goat leaping up to nip at a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevisuallinguist.com/2006/02/burnt-city-animation-vl.html|title=The Visual Linguist: Burnt City animation VL|date=February 15, 2006|publisher=The Visual Linguist|last=Cohn|first=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/article/8045|title=Oldest Animation Discovered In Iran|publisher=''Animation Magazine''|date=March 12, 2008|last=Ball|first=Ryan|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[phenakistoscope]] (1832), [[zoetrope]] (1834) and [[praxinoscope]] (1877), as well as the common [[flip book]], were early animation devices to produce movement from sequential drawings using technological means, but did not develop further until the advent of [[film|motion picture film]].

===Silent era===
[[File:How Animated Cartoons Are Made (1919).webm|thumb|''How Animated Cartoons Are Made'' (1919)]]
The first animated projection (screening) was created in France, by [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]], who was a French science teacher. Reynaud created the [[Praxinoscope]] in 1877 and the [[Théâtre Optique]] in December 1888.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=3–4}} On 28 October 1892, he projected the first animation in public, ''[[Pauvre Pierrot]]'', at the Musée Grévin in Paris. This film is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used. His films were not photographed, but drawn directly onto the transparent strip.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=5–6}} In 1900, more than 500,000 people had attended these screenings.

The first (photographed) animated projection was ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) by newspaper cartoonist [[J. Stuart Blackton]],{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=7–8}} one of the co-founders of the Vitagraph Company arrived.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=16}} In the film, a cartoonist's line drawings of two faces were 'animated' (or came to life) on a blackboard. The two faces smiled and winked, and the cigar-smoking man blew smoke in the lady's face; also, a circus clown led a small dog to jump through a hoop.

The first animated projection in the traditional sense (i.e., on [[film|motion picture film]]) was ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' by the French director [[Émile Cohl]] in 1908.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=9}} This was followed by two more films, ''Le Cauchemar du fantoche'' [''The Puppet's Nightmare,'', now lost] and ''Un Drame chez les fantoches'' [''A Puppet Drama,'' called ''The Love Affair in Toyland'' for American release and ''Mystical Love-Making'' for British release], all completed in 1908.

One of the very first successful animated cartoons was ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914) by [[Winsor McCay]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=16–17}} It is considered the first example of true [[character animation]]. At first, animated cartoons were [[black-and-white]] and silent. [[Felix the Cat]] and [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] are notable examples.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=55, 59}}

==="Golden Age"===
{{main|Golden age of American animation}}
From the 1920s to 1960s, theatrical cartoons were produced in huge numbers, and usually shown before a feature film in a movie theater. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] (distributed by [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]], then [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], then [[United Artists]], then [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], then independently), [[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer]] (distributed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM]], and [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] (distributed by [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]) were the largest studios producing these 5- to 10-minute "shorts." Other studios included [[Walter Lantz Productions|Walter Lantz]] (distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal]]), [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]] (distributed by [[United Artists]]), [[Van Beuren Studios]] (distributed by [[RKO Pictures]]), [[ComiColor Cartoons]] (distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]), [[Charles Mintz]] Studios (later [[Screen Gems]]) (distributed by [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]), [[Famous Studios]] (distributed by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]), and [[Terrytoons]] (distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]).

The first cartoon to use a [[soundtrack]] was in 1926 with [[Max Fleischer]]'s ''[[My Old Kentucky Home (movie)|My Old Kentucky Home]].'' However the Fleischers used a [[Lee De Forest|De Forest]] sound system and the sound was not completely synchronized with the film.{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=89}} [[Walt Disney]]'s 1928 cartoon ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' starring [[Mickey Mouse]] was the first to use a [[click track]] during the recording session, which produced better [[Synchronization|synchronism]]. "[[Mickey Mousing]]" became a term for any movie action (animated or [[live action]]) that was perfectly synchronized with music. The music used is original most of the time, but [[musical quotation]] is often employed. Animated characters usually performed the action in "loops," i.e., drawings were repeated over and over.

Although other producers had made films earlier using 2-strip color, Disney produced the first cartoon in 3-strip [[Technicolor]], ''[[Flowers and Trees]],'' in 1932. Technicians at the Fleischer studio invented [[rotoscoping]], in which animators trace live action in order to make animation look more realistic. However, rotoscoping made the animation look stiff and the technique was later used more for studying human and animal movement, rather than directly tracing and copying filmed movements.{{sfn|Thomas|1958|pp=14}}
Later, other movie technologies were adapted for use in animation, such as [[multiplane camera]]s with ''[[The Old Mill]]'' (1937),{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=51}} [[stereophonic sound]] in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), widescreen processes with the feature-length ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), and even [[3-D film|3D]] with ''[[Lumber Jack-Rabbit]]''.{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=265}} 

Today, [[traditional animation]] uses traditional methods, but is aided by [[computer]]s in certain areas. This gives the [[animator]] new tools not available that could not be achieved using old techniques.

==Feature films==
{{expand section|date=September 2011}}
{{main|Lists of animated feature films}}

In 1917, Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] created the first animated feature ever made, ''[[El Apóstol]]'', utilizing cutout animation; however, a fire that destroyed producer Federico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copy of the film, and it is now considered [[lost film|lost]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=49–51}}

In 1937, Disney created the first sound and color animated feature film, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=66–67}}

The name "animated cartoon" is generally not used when referring to full-length animated productions, since the term more or less implies a "short." Huge numbers of animated feature films were, and are still, produced.

==Television==
Competition from television drew audiences away from movie theaters in the late 1950s, and the theatrical cartoon began its decline. Today, animated cartoons for American audiences are produced mostly for television.

American television animation of the 1950s featured quite [[limited animation]] styles, highlighted by the work of [[Jay Ward]] on ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]''.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=234}} [[Chuck Jones]] coined the term "illustrated radio" to refer to the shoddy style of most television cartoons that depended more on their soundtracks than visuals.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=231}} Other notable 1950s programs include [[United Productions of America|UPA]]'s ''[[Gerald McBoing Boing]]'',{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|pp=131–132}} [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s ''[[Huckleberry Hound]]'' and ''[[Quick Draw McGraw]]'',{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=234}} and rebroadcast of many classic theatrical cartoons from [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s [[Walter Lantz]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[MGM]], and [[Disney]].

The Hanna-Barbera cartoon, ''[[The Flintstones]]'', was the first successful [[primetime]] animated series in the United States, running from 1960 to 1966 (and in [[reruns]] since).{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=235}} While many networks followed the show's success by scheduling other cartoons in the early 1960s, including ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Top Cat]]'', and ''[[The Alvin Show]]'', none of these programs survived more than a year (save Scooby-Doo, which, despite not being a primetime cartoon, has managed to stay afloat for over four decades). However, networks found success by running these shows as [[Saturday morning cartoons]], reaching smaller audiences with more demographic unity among children. Television animation for children flourished on Saturday morning, on cable channels like [[Nickelodeon]], [[Disney Channel]]/[[Disney XD]] and [[Cartoon Network]], [[PBS Kids]], and in syndicated afternoon timeslots.

The scheduling constraints of the TV animation process, notably issues of resource management, led to the development of various techniques known now as [[limited animation]]. Full-frame animation ("on ones") became rare in its use outside of theatrical productions in the United States.

Primetime cartoons for mature audiences were virtually non-existent in the mainstream of the United States until the 1990s hit, when ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ushered in a new era of [[adult animation]]. Now, "adult animation" programs, such as, ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'' have increased the number of animated sitcoms on prime-time and evening American television. In addition, animated works from other countries (notably Japan) have had varying levels of airplay in the United States since the 1960s.

===Commercial animation===
Animation has been very popular in television commercials, both due to its graphic appeal, and the humour it can provide. Some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades, such as [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] in advertisements for Kellogg's cereals.

The legendary animation director [[Tex Avery]] was the producer of the first [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] "[[Kills Bugs Dead]]" commercials in 1966, which were very successful for the company. The concept has been used in many countries since.

{{About|a fictional communication device||Ansible (disambiguation)}}

An '''ansible''' is a category of fictional device or technology capable of instantaneous or [[faster-than-light communication]]. It can send and receive messages to and from a corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay.

As a name for such a device, the word "ansible" first appeared in a 1966 novel by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]. Since that time, the term has been broadly used in the works of numerous science fiction authors, across a variety of settings and continuities.&lt;ref name=Sheidlower/&gt;

== Coinage by Ursula Le Guin ==
[[Ursula K. Le Guin]] [[neologism|coined]] the word "ansible" in her 1966 novel ''[[Rocannon's World]]''.&lt;ref name=Sheidlower/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernardo/&gt; The word was a contraction of "answerable", as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in a reasonable amount of time, even over [[interstellar communication|interstellar]] distances.&lt;ref name=Quinion/&gt;

Although Le Guin invented the name "ansible" for this type of device, fleshed out with specific details in her fictional works, the broader concept of instantaneous or [[faster-than-light communication]] had previously existed in science fiction. For example, similar communication functions were included in a device called an [[interocitor]] in the 1952 novel ''[[This Island Earth (novel)|This Island Earth]]'' by [[Raymond F. Jones]], and [[This Island Earth|the 1955 film]] based on that novel.

== In Le Guin's works ==
In her subsequent works, Le Guin continued to develop the concept of the ansible:

* ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', Le Guin's award-winning 1974 novel in the [[Hainish Cycle]], tells of the invention of the ansible.&lt;ref name=LeGuin1974/&gt;

* In ''[[The Word for World Is Forest]]'', Le Guin explains that in order for communication to work with any pair of ansibles, at least one "must be on a large-mass body, the other can be anywhere in the cosmos."

* In ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', it is stated that the ansible "doesn't involve radio waves, or any form of energy. The principle it works on, the constant of [[simultaneity]], is analogous in some ways to [[gravity]]&amp;nbsp;... One point has to be fixed, on a planet of certain mass, but the other end is portable."

Any ansible may be used to communicate through any other, by setting its coordinates to those of the receiving ansible. They have a limited [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] which only allows for at most a few hundred characters of text to be communicated in any transaction of a dialog session, and are attached to a keyboard and small display to perform text messaging.

== Use by later authors ==
Since Le Guin's conception of the ansible, the name of the device has been borrowed by numerous authors. While Le Guin's ansible was said to communicate "instantaneously",&lt;ref name=LeGuin1974/&gt; the name has also been adopted for devices capable of communication at finite speeds that are faster than light.

=== Orson Scott Card's works ===
[[Orson Scott Card]], in his 1977 novelette and 1985 novel ''[[Ender's Game]]'' and [[Ender's Game (series)|its sequels]], used the term "ansible" for his own fictitious communication device.&lt;ref name=Card1977/&gt; In ''Ender's Game'', a character stated that "somebody dredged the name ''ansible'' out of an old book somewhere."&lt;ref name=Card1977/&gt;

In the universe of the [[Ender's Game (series)|''Ender's Game'' series]], the ansible's functions involved a fictional subatomic particle, the philote.&lt;ref name=Card1991/&gt; The two [[quark]]s inside a [[pion|pi meson]] can be separated by an arbitrary distance, while remaining connected by "philotic rays".&lt;ref name=Card1991/&gt; This concept is similar to [[quantum teleportation]] due to [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]]; however, in reality, [[quark confinement]] prevents quarks from being separated by any observable distance.

Card's version of the ansible was also featured in the video game ''[[Advent Rising]]'', for which Card helped write the story, and in the movie ''[[Ender's Game (film)|Ender's Game]]'', which was based on the book.&lt;ref name=EnderScript/&gt;

=== Other writers ===
Numerous other writers have included ansibles in their fictional works, using that word to refer to a faster-than-light communication device. Notable examples include:
* [[Vernor Vinge]], in the 1988 short story "The Blabber"&lt;ref name="Vinge"/&gt;
* [[Elizabeth Moon]], in the 1995 novel ''[[Winning Colors (novel)|Winning Colors]]''&lt;ref name=Moon1995/&gt;
* [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]], in the 1995 computer game ''[[Marathon 2: Durandal]]''&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;
* [[L.A. Graf]], in the 1996 ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' novel ''Time's Enemy''&lt;ref name=Graf1996/&gt;
* [[Dan Simmons]], in the 2003 novel ''[[Ilium (novel)|Ilium]]''&lt;ref name="Simmons"/&gt;
* [[Kim Stanley Robinson]], in the 2012 novel ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]''&lt;ref name=Robinson2012/&gt;
* [[Becky Chambers (author)|Becky Chambers]], in the 2014 novel ''[[The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet]]''
* Joe M. McDermott, in the 2017 novel ''The Fortress at the End of Time''&lt;ref name=McDermott2017/&gt;

{{Anti-nuclear movement sidebar}}

The '''anti-nuclear movement''' is a [[new social movements|social movement]] that opposes various [[nuclear technology|nuclear technologies]]. Some [[direct action]] groups, [[environmental movement]]s, and [[professional]] organisations have identified themselves with the movement at the local, national, or international level.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Fox Butterfield. [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/27/us/professional-groups-flocking-to-antinuclear-drive.html Professional Groups Flocking to Antinuclear Drive], ''The New York Times'', 27 March 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="faculty.virginia.edu"&gt;William A. Gamson and Andre Modigliani.

The initial objective of the movement was [[nuclear disarmament]], though since the late 1960s opposition has included the use of [[nuclear power]]. Many anti-nuclear groups oppose both nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The formation of [[green party|green parties]] in the 1970s and 1980s was often a direct result of anti-nuclear politics.&lt;ref name="E. Gene Frankland 2001, p. 24"&gt;John Barry and E. Gene Frankland, ''International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics'', 2001, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists and diplomats have debated [[nuclear weapon]]s policy since before the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="brow"/&gt; The public became concerned about [[nuclear weapons testing]] from about 1954, following extensive nuclear testing in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. In 1963, many countries ratified the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing.&lt;ref name="rudig2"/&gt;

Some local opposition to [[nuclear power]] emerged in the early 1960s,&lt;ref name=well&gt;Paula Garb. [http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_6/wellockvol6.htm  Review of Critical Masses], ''Journal of Political Ecology'', Vol 6, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns.&lt;ref name="rudig"/&gt; In the early 1970s, there were large [[protests]] about a proposed nuclear power plant in [[Wyhl]], West Germany. The project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of [[Europe]] and [[North America]].&lt;ref name="pub"/&gt;&lt;ref name="got"/&gt; Nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s&lt;ref name=jimfalk&gt;Jim Falk (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; and while opposition to nuclear power continues, increasing public support for nuclear power has re-emerged over the last decade in light of growing awareness of global warming and renewed interest in all types of clean energy (see the [[Pro-nuclear movement]]).

A protest against nuclear power occurred in July 1977 in [[Bilbao]], Spain, with up to 200,000 people in attendance. Following the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, an anti-nuclear protest was held in New York City, involving 200,000 people. In 1981, Germany's largest anti-nuclear power demonstration took place to protest against the [[Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant]] west of Hamburg; some 100,000 people came face to face with 10,000 police officers. The largest protest was held on June 12, 1982, when one million people demonstrated in [[New York City]] against nuclear weapons.  A 1983 nuclear weapons protest in [[West Berlin]] had about 600,000 participants. In May 1986, following the [[Chernobyl disaster]], an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people marched in Rome to protest against the Italian nuclear program. In the US, public opposition preceded the shutdown of the [[Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant|Shoreham]], [[Yankee Rowe]], [[Millstone Nuclear Power Plant|Millstone 1]], [[Rancho Seco]], [[Maine Yankee]], and many other nuclear power plants.

For many years after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. Some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. In the 2000s (decade), however, following [[public relations]] activities by the nuclear industry,&lt;ref name=leoh&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/28/nuclear-lobbyists-senior-civil-servants |title=Nuclear lobbyists wined and dined senior civil servants, documents show |author=Leo Hickman  |date=28 November 2012  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diane Farseta 38-56" &gt;{{cite web |title=The Campaign to Sell Nuclear |author=Diane Farseta  |date=September 1, 2008 |volume=64 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages=38–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Nuclear Charm Offensive"&gt;Jonathan Leake.

The Soviet Union conducted 456 nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk from 1949 until 1989 with little regard for their effect on the local people or environment.

From an anti-nuclear point of view, there is a threat to modern civilization from global [[nuclear war]] by accidental or deliberate nuclear strike.&lt;ref name=Fridab/&gt; Some climate scientists estimate that a war between two countries that resulted in 100 Hiroshima-size atomic explosions would cause significant loss of life, in the tens of millions from climatic effects alone and disabled future generation

Local Nuclear War, Global Suffering, ''Scientific American'', January 2010, p. 74-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many anti-nuclear weapons groups cite the 1996 Advisory Opinion of the [[International Court of Justice]], ''[[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons|Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons]]'', in which it found that 'the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=4&amp;k=e1&amp;case=95&amp;code=unan&amp;p3=4|title=Cour internationale de Justice - International Court|website=www.icj-cij.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ridding the world of nuclear weapons has been a cause for pacifists for decades. But more recently mainstream politicians and retired military leaders have advocated [[nuclear disarmament]]. In January 2007 an article in ''The Wall Street Journal'', authored by [[Henry Kissinger]], [[William Perry|Bill Perry]], [[George Shultz]] and [[Sam Nunn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-new-abolitionists |title=The new abolitionists |author=Hugh Gusterson |date=30 March 2012 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606022845/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-new-abolitionists |archivedate=6 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These men were veterans of the [[cold-war]] who believed in using nuclear weapons for [[nuclear deterrence|deterrence]]. But they now reversed their previous position and asserted that instead of making the world safer, nuclear weapons had become a source of extreme concern.&lt;ref name=globalzero&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18836134 |title=Nuclear endgame: The growing appeal of zero |author= |date=June 16, 2011 |work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, some countries have built their own [[Second strike|second-strike capability]] of [[massive retaliation|massive deterrence]] in the event of a military attack with [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]. 
Two examples of this second-strike capability are the [[Samson Option]] strategy of [[Israel]], and the [[Dead Hand]] system of [[Russia]].
During the era of [[nuclear weapons testing]] many local communities were affected, and some are still affected by [[uranium mining]], and radioactive waste disposal.&lt;ref name=Fridab&gt;Frida Berrigan.

There are large variations in peoples’ understanding of the issues surrounding nuclear power, including the technology itself, its deployment, [[climate change]], and [[energy security]]. There is a wide spectrum of views and concerns over [[nuclear power]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Sustainable Development Commission]]. [http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/publications/downloads/Nuclear_public_engagement-briefing.pdf Public engagement and nuclear power]&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains a controversial area of [[Nuclear energy policy|public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Development Commission. [http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/publications/downloads/IsNuclearTheAnswer.pdf Is Nuclear the Answer?] p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have shown that the public "perceives nuclear power as a very risky technology" and, around the world, nuclear energy has declined in popularity since the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref name=rb2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=[[M.V. Ramana]] |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |page=44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/8.abstract |title=The implications of Fukushima: The US perspective |author=[[Mark Cooper (academic)|Mark Cooper]] |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-nuclear critics see nuclear power as a dangerous, expensive way to boil water to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Caldicott (2006).  ''Nuclear Power is Not the Answer to Global Warming or Anything Else'', Melbourne University Press, {{ISBN|0-522-85251-3}}, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of nuclear power have raised a number of related concerns:&lt;ref name = bm&gt;[[Brian Martin (social scientist)|Brian Martin]]. [http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/07sa.html Opposing nuclear power: past and present], ''Social Alternatives'', Vol. 26, No. 2, Second Quarter 2007, pp. 43–47.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nuclear accident]]s: a concern that the core of a nuclear power plant could overheat and melt down, releasing radioactivity.
*[[High-level radioactive waste management|Radioactive waste disposal]]: a concern that nuclear power results in large amounts of radioactive waste, some of which remains dangerous for very long periods.
*[[Nuclear proliferation]]: a concern that [[Heavy water reactor#Nuclear proliferation|some types]] of nuclear reactor designs use and/or produce  [[fissile material]] which could be used in [[nuclear weapons]].
*[[Economics of new nuclear power plants|High cost]]: a concern that nuclear power plants are very expensive.
*[[Vulnerability of nuclear plants to attack|Attacks on nuclear plants]]: a concern that nuclear facilities could be targeted by terrorists or criminals.
*Curtailed [[civil liberties]]: a concern that the risk of nuclear accidents, proliferation and terrorism may be used to justify restraints on citizen rights.

Of these concerns, nuclear accidents and disposal of long-lived radioactive waste have probably had the greatest public impact worldwide.&lt;ref name = bm/&gt; Anti-nuclear campaigners point to the 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima nuclear emergency]] as proof that nuclear power can never be 100% safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/22/japan-nuclear-crisis-uk-power-stations |title=Japan nuclear crisis puts UK public off new power stations |author=Bibi van der Zee |date=22 March 2011 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', [[Jim Falk]]  explores connections between technological concerns and political concerns. Falk suggests that concerns of citizen groups or individuals who oppose nuclear power have often focused initially on the "range of physical hazards which accompany the technology" and leads to a "concern over the political relations of the nuclear industry" A more neutral observer might observe that this is nothing more than a [[conspiracy theory]]. [[Baruch Fischhoff]], a social science professor said that many people really do not trust the nuclear industry.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/business/energy-environment/22NUKE.html?pagewanted=all  Edging Back to Nuclear Power] ''The New York Times'', April 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wade Allison]], a physics professor actually says "radiation is safe &amp; all nations should embrace nuclear technology"&lt;ref name= "Why &amp; technology"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ6aL3wv4v0&amp;feature=youtu.be|title= Why radiation is safe &amp; all nations should embrace nuclear technology|authors= Prof. Wade Allison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[M.V. Ramana]] says that "distrust of the social institutions that manage nuclear energy is widespread", and a 2001 survey by the European Commission found that "only 10.1 percent of Europeans trusted the nuclear industry". This public distrust is periodically reinforced by nuclear safety violations, or through ineffectiveness or corruption of the nuclear regulatory authorities. Once lost, says Ramana, trust is extremely difficult to regain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=M. V. Ramana |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |pages=47–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with public antipathy, the nuclear industry has "tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power", including the publication of  numerous "fact sheets" that discuss issues of public concern. M.V. Ramana says that none of these strategies have been very successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=[[M.V. Ramana]] |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |page=46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear proponents have tried to regain public support by offering newer, safer, reactor designs. These designs include those that  incorporate passive safety and Small Modular Reactors. While these reactor designs "are intended to inspire trust, they may have an unintended effect: creating distrust of older reactors that lack the touted safety features".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=M.

Since 2000 the nuclear industry has undertaken an international media and lobbying campaign to promote nuclear power as a solution to the [[greenhouse effect]] and [[climate change]].&lt;ref name = markd/&gt; Nuclear power, the industry says, emits no or negligible amounts of carbon dioxide. Anti-nuclear groups respond by saying that only reactor operation is free of carbon dioxide emissions. All other stages of the [[nuclear fuel chain]] – mining, milling, transport, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning and waste management – use fossil fuels and hence emit carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=markd&gt;Mark Diesendorf.

There is a wide range of published energy-related studies which conclude that [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency programs]] and [[renewable energy|renewable power technologies]] are a better energy option than nuclear power plants. This diverse range of studies come from many different sources, across the political spectrum, and from various academic disciplines, which suggests that there is a consensus among many independent, non-partisan energy experts that nuclear power plants are a poor way to produce electrical power.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]'', ''[[Non-Nuclear Futures]]'', ''[[Reaction Time]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stop-ITER Pertuis.jpg|thumb|Protest against ITER in France, 2009]]
The international nuclear fusion project [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER) is constructing the world's largest and most advanced experimental [[tokamak]] [[fusion reactor|nuclear fusion reactor]] in the south of [[France]]. A collaboration between the [[European Union]] (EU), [[India]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]] and the [[United States]], the project aims to make a transition from experimental studies of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] physics to electricity-producing [[fusion power]] plants. In 2005, [[Greenpeace International]] issued a press statement criticizing government funding of the ITER, believing the money should have been diverted to renewable energy sources and claiming that fusion energy would result in nuclear waste and nuclear weapons proliferation issues. A French association including about 700 anti-nuclear groups, [[Sortir du nucléaire (France)|Sortir du nucléaire]] (Get Out of Nuclear Energy), claimed that ITER was a hazard because scientists did not yet know how to manipulate the high-energy deuterium and tritium [[hydrogen]] isotopes used in the fusion process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1631650,00.html |title=France Wins Nuclear Fusion Plant|author=Deutsche Welle|date=28 June 2005|website=dw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to most anti-nuclear groups, nuclear fusion power “remains a distant dream”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foe.org.au/anti-nuclear/issues/nfc/power/new-reactor-types/ |title=New Reactor Types – pebble bed, thorium, plutonium, fusion |author=Jim Green |year=2012 |work=Friends of the Earth }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Nuclear Association]] have said that fusion "presents so far insurmountable scientific and engineering challenges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf66.htm |title=Nuclear Fusion Power |author= World Nuclear Association |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and [[cost overrun|budget overruns]]. Several milestones of the project has already been finished, but the finishing date for First Plasma has been discussed and postponed many times with various conclusions.

Anti-nuclear groups say that reliance on nuclear energy can be reduced by adopting [[energy conservation]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] measures. Energy efficiency can reduce energy consumption while providing the same level of energy "services".&lt;ref name=gierec&gt;Greenpeace International and European Renewable Energy Council (January 2007).

According to [[Lester R. Brown]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the transition from coal, oil, and gas to wind, solar, and geothermal energy is well under way. In the old economy, energy was produced by burning something — oil, coal, or natural gas — leading to the carbon emissions that have come to define our economy.

[[Greenpeace]] advocates a reduction of fossil fuels by 50% by 2050 as well as phasing out nuclear power, contending that innovative technologies can increase energy efficiency, and suggests that by 2050 most electricity will come from renewable sources.&lt;ref name=green/&gt; The International Energy Agency estimates that nearly 50% of global electricity supplies will need to come from renewable energy sources in order to halve carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and minimise climate change impacts.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency.

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]], a Stanford professor, says producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]],  and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.&lt;ref name=enpol2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |author=Mark A.

[[File:Anti-nuclear protest at the NTS 3.jpg|thumb|Members of [[Nevada Desert Experience]] hold a prayer vigil during the Easter period of 1982 at the entrance to the [[Nevada Test Site]].]]

The anti-nuclear movement is a [[new social movements|social movement]] which operates at the local, national, and international level. Various types of groups have identified themselves with the movement:&lt;ref name="faculty.virginia.edu"/&gt;
* [[direct action]] groups, such as the [[Clamshell Alliance]] and [[Shad Alliance]]
* [[Environmentalism|environmental]] groups, such as [[Friends of the Earth]] and [[Greenpeace]]
* [[consumer protection]] groups, such as [[Ralph Nader]]'s [[List of anti-nuclear groups in the United States#Critical Mass|Critical Mass]]
* [[professional]] organisations,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; such as [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]]
* [[political party|political parties]] such as [[European Free Alliance]]

Anti-nuclear groups have undertaken public [[protest]]s and acts of [[civil disobedience]] which have included occupations of nuclear plant sites. Other salient strategies have included lobbying, petitioning government authorities, influencing [[public policy]] through referendum campaigns and involvement in elections. Anti-nuclear groups have also tried to influence policy implementation through litigation and by participating in licensing proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Kitschelt. [http://www.marcuse.org/harold/hmimages/seabrook/861KitscheltAntiNuclear4Democracies.pdf Political Opportunity and Political Protest: Anti-Nuclear Movements in Four Democracies] ''British Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 16, No. 1, 1986, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-nuclear power organisations have emerged in every country that has had a nuclear power programme. Protest movements against nuclear power first emerged in the United States, at the local level, and spread quickly to Europe and the rest of the world. National nuclear campaigns emerged in the late 1970s. Fuelled by the [[Three Mile Island accident]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the anti-nuclear power movement mobilised political and economic forces which for some years "made nuclear energy untenable in many countries".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, the formation of [[green parties]] was often a direct result of anti-nuclear politics (e.g., in Germany and Sweden).&lt;ref name="E. Gene Frankland 2001, p. 24"/&gt;

Some of these anti-nuclear power organisations are reported to have developed considerable expertise on [[nuclear power]] and energy issues.&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). ''International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power'', Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the chairman of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] said that "his agency had been pushed in the right direction on safety issues because of the pleas and protests of nuclear watchdog groups".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald.

In 1971, the town of [[Wyhl]], in Germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. In the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests. Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue.  In 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant.&lt;ref name=pub&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen C.

In West Germany, between February 1975 and April 1979, some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites. Several site occupations were also attempted. Following the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref name=kits/&gt;

These included the well-known [[Clamshell Alliance]] protests at [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant]] and the [[Abalone Alliance]] protests at [[Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant]], where thousands of protesters were arrested. Other large protests followed the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]].&lt;ref name=protest&gt;{{cite book|last=Giugni|first=Marco|title=Social Protest and Policy Change: Ecology, Antinuclear, and Peace Movements in Comparative Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kn6YhNtyVigC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2004|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1827-8|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casualties===
[[File:Gorleben0001.JPG|thumb|Anti-nuclear demonstrations near [[Gorleben]], Lower Saxony, Germany, 8 May 1996]]
Casualties during anti-nuclear protests include:

*On 9 December 1982, [[Norman Mayer]], an American anti–nuclear weapons activist, was shot and killed by the [[United States Park Police]] after threatening to blow up the [[Washington Monument]], [[Washington, D.C.]], unless a national dialogue on the threat of nuclear weapons was seriously undertaken.
*On 10 July 1985, the flagship of [[Greenpeace]], [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|''Rainbow Warrior'']], was sunk by French agents in New Zealand waters, and a Greenpeace photographer was killed. The ship was involved in protests against [[nuclear weapons testing]] at [[Mururoa Atoll]]. The French Government initially denied any involvement with the sinking but eventually admitted its guilt in October 1985. Two French agents pleaded guilty to charges of manslaughter, and the French Government paid $7 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Newtan, Samuel Upton (2007). ''Nuclear War 1 and Other Major Nuclear Disasters of the 20th Century'', AuthorHouse, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1990, two pylons holding high-voltage power lines connecting the French and Italian grid were blown up by Italian [[eco-terrorism|eco-terrorists]], and the attack is believed to have been directly in opposition against the Superphénix.&lt;ref&gt;WISE Paris.

Beginning in the 1950s, anti-nuclear ideas received coverage in the popular media with novels such as ''[[Fail-Safe (novel)|Fail-Safe]]'' and [[List of films about nuclear issues|feature films]] such as ''[[Godzilla (1954)]]'',''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' (1979), ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Rainbow Warrior (film)|The Rainbow Warrior]]'' (1992).

''Dr. Strangelove'' explored "what might happen within the Pentagon ... if some maniac Air Force general should suddenly order a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union". One reviewer called the movie "one of the cleverest and most incisive satiric thrusts at the awkwardness and folly of the military that has ever been on the screen".&lt;ref&gt;Bosley Crowther. [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173DE367BC4950DFB766838F679EDE Movie Review: Dr. Strangelove (1964)] ''The New York Times'', January 31, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The China Syndrome'' has been described as a "gripping 1979 drama about the dangers of nuclear power" which had an extra impact when the real-life accident at the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear plant]] occurred several weeks after the film opened. [[Jane Fonda]] plays a TV reporter who witnesses a near-[[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] (the "[[China Syndrome (nuclear meltdown)|China syndrome]]" of the title) at a local nuclear plant, which was averted by a quick-thinking engineer, played by [[Jack Lemmon]]. The plot suggests that corporate greed and cost-cutting "have led to potentially deadly faults in the plant's construction".&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/9338/The-China-Syndrome/overview The China Syndrome (1979)] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Silkwood'' was inspired by the true-life story of [[Karen Silkwood]], who died in a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the [[Kerr-McGee]] [[plutonium]] plant where she worked.&lt;ref name=contr/&gt;

''[[Dark Circle (film)|Dark Circle]]'' is a 1982 American documentary film that focuses on the connections between the [[nuclear weapons]] and the [[nuclear power]] industries, with a strong emphasis on the individual human and protracted U.S. environmental costs involved.  A clear point made by the film is that while only two bombs were dropped on Japan, [[Nevada National Security Site|many hundreds were exploded in the United States]]. The film won the Grand Prize for documentary at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and received a national [[Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding individual achievement in news and documentary."&lt;ref name="Dark Circle"&gt;''[https://www.pbs.org/pov/darkcircle/ Dark Circle]'', DVD release date March 27, 2007, Directors: Judy Irving, Chris Beaver, Ruth Landy. {{ISBN|0-7670-9304-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For the opening scenes and about half of its length, the film focuses on the [[Rocky Flats Plant]] and [[Radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant|its plutonium contamination of the area's environment]].

''[[Nuclear Tipping Point]]'' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] produced by the [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]. It features interviews with four American government officials who were in office during the [[Cold War]] period, but are now advocating for the elimination of [[nuclear weapon]]s. They are: [[Henry Kissinger]], [[George Shultz]], [[Sam Nunn]], and [[William Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=2010-06-10 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123012569&amp;sc=emaf |title=Documentary Advances Nuclear Free Movement |publisher=NPR }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) was a musical group founded in 1979 by [[Jackson Browne]], [[Graham Nash]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], following the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]].  The group organized a series of five ''No Nukes'' concerts held at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City in September 1979.  On September 23, 1979, almost 200,000 people attended a large anti-nuclear rally staged by MUSE on the then-empty north end of the [[Battery Park City]] [[landfill]] in New York.&lt;ref name="Herman B1"/&gt; The album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', and a film, also titled ''[[No Nukes (film)|No Nukes]]'', were both released in 1980 to document the performances.

In 2007, Bonnie Raitt, Graham Nash, and Jackson Browne, as part of the [[No Nukes group]], recorded a [[music video]] of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] song "[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nukefree.org/node/96 |title="For What It’s Worth," No Nukes Reunite After Thirty Years|website=www.nukefree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nirs.org/home.htm Musicians Act to Stop New Atomic Reactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609064533/http://www.nirs.org/home.htm |date=9 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' is a nontechnical online magazine that has been published continuously since 1945, when it was founded by former [[Manhattan Project]] [[physicist]]s after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. The ''Bulletin''{{'}}s primary aim is to inform the public about nuclear policy debates while advocating for the international control of nuclear weapons. One of the driving forces behind the creation of the ''Bulletin'' was the amount of public interest surrounding atomic energy at the dawn of the [[atomic age]]. In 1945 the public interest in atomic warfare and weaponry inspired contributors to the ''Bulletin'' to attempt to inform those interested about the dangers and destruction that atomic war could bring about.&lt;ref name="Bombs Early Light" &gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Paul S. |authorlink=Paul Boyer (historian) |title=By the Bomb's Early Light |publisher=Pantheon |year=1985 |isbn=9780394528786 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, the ''Bulletin'' was involved in the formation of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], annual conferences of scientists concerned about [[nuclear proliferation]].

Historian [[Lawrence S. Wittner]] has argued that anti-nuclear sentiment and activism led directly to government policy shifts about nuclear weapons. Public opinion influenced policymakers by limiting their options and also by forcing them to follow certain policies over others. Wittner credits public pressure and anti-nuclear activism with "Truman’s decision to explore the [[Baruch Plan]], Eisenhower’s efforts towards a nuclear test ban and the 1958 testing moratorium, and Kennedy’s signing of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]]".&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

In terms of nuclear power, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, in the September 1975 issue, reported that "the anti-nuclear coalition has been remarkably successful ... [and] has certainly slowed the expansion of nuclear power."&lt;ref name=eleven/&gt; California has banned the approval of new nuclear reactors since the late 1970s because of concerns over [[High level radioactive waste|waste disposal]],&lt;ref&gt;Jim Doyle.

The proliferation of nuclear weapons became a presidential priority issue for the [[Carter Administration]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name = gamson/&gt; To deal with proliferation problems, President Carter promoted stronger international control over nuclear technology, including nuclear reactor technology. Although a strong supporter of nuclear power generally, Carter turned against the breeder reactor because the [[plutonium]] it produced could be diverted into nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=gamson&gt;William A. Gamson and Andre Modigliani.

For many years after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries. In recent years, intense public relations activities by the nuclear industry, increasing evidence of climate change and failures to address it, have brought nuclear power issues back to the forefront of policy discussion in the [[nuclear renaissance]] countries.&lt;ref name = markd/&gt;&lt;ref name=res/&gt; But some countries are not prepared to expand nuclear power and are still divesting themselves of their nuclear legacy, through [[nuclear power phase-out]] legislation.&lt;ref name=res&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS101123+06-May-2009+BW20090506 Research and Markets: International Perspectives on Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power] ''Reuters'', May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the ''[[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]]'', all territorial sea and land of New Zealand is declared a [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|nuclear free zone]].

In the United States, a 2007 [[University of Maryland]] survey showed that 73 percent of the public surveyed favours the elimination of all nuclear weapons, 64 percent support removing all nuclear weapons from high alert, and 59 percent support reducing U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles to 400 weapons each. Given the unpopularity of nuclear weapons, U.S. politicians have been wary of supporting new nuclear programs. Republican-dominated congresses "have defeated the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s plan to build so-called 'bunker-busters' and 'mini-nukes'."&lt;ref name=lawsw/&gt;

Today, some 26,000 nuclear weapons remain in the arsenals of the nine nuclear powers, with thousands on hair-trigger alert. Although U.S., Russian, and British nuclear arsenals are shrinking in size, those in the four Asian nuclear nations—China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea—are growing, in large part because of tensions among them. This Asian arms race also has possibilities of bringing Japan into the nuclear club.&lt;ref name=lsw/&gt;

During [[Barack Obama]]'s successful U.S. presidential election campaign, he advocated the abolition of nuclear weapons.  Since his election he has reiterated this goal in several major policy addresses.&lt;ref name=lsw/&gt; In 2010, the Obama administration [[New START|negotiated a new weapons accord with Russia]] for a reduction of the maximum number of deployed nuclear weapons on each side from 2,200 to between 1,500 and 1,675—a reduction of some 30 percent.

German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s coalition announced on May 30, 2011, that Germany’s 17 nuclear power stations will be shut down by 2022, in a policy reversal following Japan's [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] and anti-nuclear protests within Germany.

===Public opinion surveys on nuclear issues===
{{Main|Public opinion on nuclear issues}}
In 2005, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] presented the results of a series of public opinion surveys in the ''Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues'' report.&lt;ref name= IAE/&gt;  Majorities of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of [[nuclear terrorism|terrorist acts involving radioactive materials]] at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally support the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear power plants should be closed down.&lt;ref name= IAE/&gt; Stressing the [[climate change]] benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name=IAE&gt;[[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (2005). [http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/gponi_report2005.pdf Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues and the IAEA: Final Report from 18 Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409124139/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/gponi_report2005.pdf |date=9 April 2008 }} pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency [[GlobeScan]], commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]]. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believe that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs.&lt;ref name=rb2011&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15864806 |title=Nuclear power 'gets little public support worldwide' |author=Richard Black  |date=25 November 2011 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to reach political agreement on effective [[climate change policy|policies for climate change]] continue, and pro-nuclear environmentalists seek to reverse the traditionally anti-nuclear attitudes of environmentalists.

Anti-nuclear activists are accused of encouraging [[Radiophobia|radiophobic]] emotions among the public. ''The War Against the Atom'' (Basic Books, 1982) Samuel MacCracken of Boston University argued that in 1982, 50,000 deaths per year could be attributed directly to non-nuclear power plants, if fuel production and transportation, as well as pollution, were taken into account. He argued that if non-nuclear plants were judged by the same standards as nuclear ones, each US non-nuclear power plant could be held responsible for about 100 deaths per year.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel MacCracken, ''The War Against the Atom'', 1982, Basic Books, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nuclear Energy Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nei.org/ Nuclear Energy Institute] website&lt;/ref&gt; (NEI) is the main lobby group for companies doing nuclear work in the United States, while most countries that employ nuclear energy have a national industry group. The [[World Nuclear Association]] is the only global trade body.  In seeking to counteract the arguments of nuclear opponents, it points to independent studies that quantify the costs and benefits of nuclear energy and compares them to the costs and benefits of alternatives.  NEI sponsors studies of its own, but it also references studies performed for the [[World Health Organization]],&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health: Budapest, Hungary, 23–25 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[International Energy Agency]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://ww.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/ElecCostSUM.pdf Executive Summary]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by university researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Ari Rabl and Mona. Dreicer, Health and Environmental Impacts of Energy Systems.  ''International Journal of Global Energy Issues'', vol.18(2/3/4), 113–150 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the anti-nuclear movement point to independent studies that show that the capital resources required for renewable energy sources are higher than those required for nuclear power.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Some people, including former opponents of nuclear energy, criticise the movement on the basis of the claim that [[Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|nuclear power is necessary]] for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. These individuals include [[James Lovelock]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; originator of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[Patrick Moore (environmentalist)|Patrick Moore]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; a co-founder of [[Greenpeace]] and former director of Greenpeace International, [[George Monbiot]] and [[Stewart Brand]], creator of the [[Whole Earth Catalog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/16398/ |title=Environmental Heresies|first=Stewart|last=Brand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/science/earth/27tier.html?ex=1330405200&amp;en=e561a6494b06049d&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=digg&amp;exprod=digg|title=Stewart Brand - John Tierney - An Early Environmentalist, Embracing New ‘Heresies’|first=John|last=Tierney|date=27 February 2007|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock goes further to refute claims about the danger of nuclear energy and its waste products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecolo.org/lovelock/|title=James LOVELOCK's web site - the international homepage|first=Bruno|last=Comby|website=www.ecolo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 2008 interview, Moore said that "It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that I started rethinking energy policy in general and realised that I had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com/From-eco-warrior-to-nuclear-champion/2008-13840_3-6228461.html|title=Technology News|website=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anti-nuclear organisations have acknowledged that their positions are subject to review.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-22-nuclear-power_N.htm Some rethinking nuke opposition] USA Today&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, [[Dan Becker]], Director of Global Warming for the Sierra Club, declared, "Switching from dirty coal plants to dangerous nuclear power is like giving up smoking cigarettes and taking up crack."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstrib.com/featured-series/energy-series/Articles/A_7-20-2007_1_4.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  James Lovelock criticizes holders of such a view: "Opposition to nuclear energy is based on irrational fear fed by Hollywood-style fiction, the Green lobbies and the media."  ". . .I am a Green and I entreat my friends in the movement to drop their wrongheaded objection to nuclear energy."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;

[[George Monbiot]], an English writer known for his environmental and political activism, once expressed deep antipathy to the nuclear industry.&lt;ref&gt;George Monbiot [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2000/mar/30/energy.nuclearindustry?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 "The nuclear winter draws near"], ''The Guardian'', 30 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in March 2011.

An '''Australophile''' is one who appreciates or expresses love of [[Australian culture]], the [[Australians|Australian people]], [[Australian history]] or all things [[Australia]]n in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.tinyonline.co.uk/gswithenbank/wordsluv.htm  Words of Love]&lt;/ref&gt; An Australophile may extend to someone who is born outside Australia and the definition is not limited to an Australian itself. The concept of Australophilia is opposed to [[Australophobia]], which is the dislike or fear of Australia and its cultural aspects. 

The phenomenon was notable in the United States in the 1980's, as many films released at the time took place in Australia or featured Australian characters.

Australia is also a popular choice for students attending universities who are doing study abroad programs.

==Description==
In some cases, the term ''Australophile'' represents an individual's appreciation of [[History of Australia|Australian history]] and traditional Australian culture (e.g. [[Ned Kelly]], [[Steve Irwin]], [[Don Bradman]], [[Phar Lap]]) Australophile may also be characterized by fondness for the [[Outback]], [[Uluru]], [[List of beaches in Australia|beaches of Australia]] and [[Great Barrier Reef]] or institutions (e.g. [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]], [[Surf Life Saving Australia]], [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia]]), and the old Australian class system. Australophile may enjoy Australian actors, films, TV shows, radio shows, [[Australian comedy|comedy]], musicians, books, magazines, fashion designers, [[Architecture of Australia|Architecture]] [[Australian cars|cars]], traditions (e.g. [[Sausage sizzle]]) or subcultures. 

Australian artists such as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Keith Urban]], and [[Iggy Azalea]] have found success abroad throughout the history of popular culture. 

Australia has been the setting for many films. Film franchises such as [[Mad Max]] and [[Crocodile Dundee]] have been credited as leading to a sparked interest in the country.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

'''Bahamian English''' is a variety of [[English language|English]] spoken in the [[Bahamas]] and by Bahamian diasporas. The standard for official use and education is [[British English|British]]-based.&lt;ref name=Sociolinguistics&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ammon|first1=Ulrich|last2=Dittmar|first2=Norbert|last3=Mattheier|first3=Klaus J.|title=Sociolinguistics: An International Handbook of the Science of Language and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMZm0w0k1c4C&amp;pg=PA2069|year=2006|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-018418-1|page=2069|quote = British-based standard Bahamian English is the official language [...] Although standard Bahamian is non-rhotic, many Bahamians view r-full American pronunciations as "correct" and try to imitate them, even to the extent of introducing a [[hypercorrect]] /r/ in [...] ''Baharmas''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[KIT lexical set|Kit vowel]]: The same as in American English, the default {{IPA|[ɪ]}}.
*The [[DRESS lexical set|Dress vowel]]: The vowel is {{IPA|[ɛ]}}.
*The Trap vowel: This vowel is mostly {{IPA|[a]}} or {{IPA|[æ]}}.
*The Lot vowel: As mostly of the US, this vowel is usually {{IPA|[ɑ]}}.
*The Strut vowel: It is the same as in the US English, {{IPA|[ʌ]}}.
*The Foot vowel: It is {{IPA|[ʊ]}}.
*The Fleece vowel: It is {{IPA|[i]}} or a diphthong {{IPA|[ɪi]}}.
*The Face [[diphthong]]: It is generally {{IPA|[eɪ]}} or {{IPA|[ɛɪ]}}.
*The Palm vowel: It is mostly {{IPA|[ɑ]}}.
*The Thought vowel: The vowel is {{IPA|[ɔ]}}.
*The Goat diphthong: It is generally {{IPA|[ɵʊ]}} or {{IPA|[oʊ]}}.
*The Near diphthong: It is {{IPA|[eə]}} or {{IPA|[iə]}}.
*The Square diphthong: It is {{IPA|[eə]}}.
*The Start vowel: It is {{IPA|[ɑː]}}.
*The North diphthong: usually {{IPA|[ɔə]}}.
*The Force diphthong: usually {{IPA|[oə]}}.
*The Cure diphthong: usually {{IPA|[uə]}}.
*The Bath vowel: This vowel is mostly {{IPA|[a]}} or {{IPA|[æ]}}.

*The Choice diphthong: It is {{IPA|[oɪ]}} or {{IPA|[ɑɪ]}}.
*The Mouth diphthong: It varies among {{IPA|[ao]}}, {{IPA|[aɵ]}} {{IPA|[aɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɑə]}}.
*The happY vowel: It is pretty much the ''kit'' vowel: {{IPA|[ɪ]}}.
*The lettEr-horsEs-commA vowel is {{IPA|[ə]}} ([[schwa]]).

There is poor distinction between the {{IPA|[v]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} sounds in Bahamian English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childs|first1=Becky|last2=Wolfram|first2=Walt|editor1-last=Schneider|editor1-first=Edgar W.|title=Varieties of English |volume= 2: The Americas and the Caribbean|date=2008|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|pages=239–255|chapter=Bahamian English: phonology}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The contrast is often [[neutralization (linguistics)|neutralize]]d or merged into {{IPA|[v]}}, {{IPA|[b]}} or {{IPA|[β]}}, so ''village'' sounds like {{IPA|[wɪlɪdʒ]}}, {{IPA|[vɪlɪdʒ]}} or {{IPA|[βɪlɪdʒ]}}. This also happens in the [[Vincentian English|Vincentian]], [[Bermudian English|Bermudian]] and other [[Caribbean English]]es.

[[Dental fricative]]s are usually changed to [[alveolar plosive]]s ([[th-stopping|''th''-stopping]]):
* Voiced ''th'' becomes /d/, e.g. "That" turns into "dat"; "Those" &gt; "Dose"; "There" &gt; "Dere"; "They" &gt; "Dey".
* Unvoiced ''th'' becomes /t/, e.g. "Thanks" becomes "tanks"; "Throw" &gt; "Trow"; "Three" &gt; "Tree".

The '''Baths of Agrippa''' ([[Latin]]: Thermae Agrippae) was a structure of [[ancient Rome]], in what is now [[Italy]], built by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]]. It was the first of the great [[thermae]] constructed in the city, and also the first public bath.
== History ==
[[File:Rom, die Agrippa Thermen.JPG|thumb|Remains of the Baths of Agrippa.|left]]
In the bath's first form, completed in 25 BC, it was a hot-air room also known as a "laconian sudatorium or gymnasium".&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio (53.27.1)&lt;/ref&gt; With the completion of the [[Aqua Virgo]] in 19 BC, the baths were supplied with water and with the addition of a large lake and canal (''[[Stagnum Agrippae]]'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Thermae_Agrippae.html (LacusCurtius website) Samuel Ball Platner, ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (London: Oxford University Press)] 1929. See also note by William Thayer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the construction and Agrippa's death in 12 BC, the Baths were open to the public with an entrance fee charge. This charge was typically a [[Quadrans|quadran]]. Upon his death, Agrippa left the baths to the citizens of Rome to use free of charge in exchange for donating various estates to [[Augustus]], creating the first public bath structure.&lt;ref&gt;Dio LIV.29.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Innovation and the baths of Agrippa |last1= Simpson |first1= C.J. |last2= Brundett |first2= N.G.R. |journal= Athenaeum |date= January 1, 1997 |volume= 85 |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baths of Agrippa were damaged along with many other structures by a large fire in AD 80,&lt;ref&gt;Cass. Dio LXVI.24:&lt;/ref&gt; but were restored shortly thereafter by [[Domitian]].

The thermae were enlarged under [[Hadrian]] in the second century AD&lt;ref&gt;Hist. Aug. Hadr. 19: Romae instauravit lavacrum Agrippae; ''cf.'' also a reference in CIL VI.9797 = AL 294&lt;/ref&gt; and later by the emperors [[Constantius II|Constantius]] and [[Constans]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; in the fourth century AD. [[Sidonius Apollonaris]] mentions that the Baths of Agrippa were still being used in the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;Regionary Catalogue (Reg. IX)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 599, Pope Gregory the Great transformed the Baths into a nunnery.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Baths and Bathing in Classical Antiquity|last = Yegul|first = Fikret|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 1992|isbn = 0-262-24035-1|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London, England|pages = 133–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 7th century the structure (no longer in use after the [[Ostrogoths]] cut off the [[Roman aqueducts]] in the 530s) was being mined for its building materials, but much of the Baths were still standing in the 16th century, when the ruins were drawn by [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], among others.

Today just part of the circular wall of the rotunda remains.

== The baths ==

[[File:Plan Rome - Thermen van Agrippa.png|thumb|Map of the Roman Campus Martius. Highlighted in red are the Baths of Agrippa. ]]
The first version of the Baths of Agrippa, also known as the ''Laconicum'', was finished in 25 BCE. A ''laconicum'' appears to have been an earlier version of a heated bath which was also associated with a running track and exercise facilities for youths.&lt;ref name="Claridge"&gt;Claridge, Amanda. ''Rome: An Oxford Archaeological Guide''. Oxford: Oxford University Press (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Dio tells us that they “gave the name ''Laconian'' to the gymnasium because the Lacedaemonians had a greater reputation at that time than any one else for stripping and exercising after anointing themselves with oil”.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; Agrippa also dedicated his [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the original structure where the current Trajanic reconstruction sits, in the same year.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; In fact, [[Cassius Dio]] claims that three structures were completed by Agrippa in this year, the third being the Stoa of Neptune, suggesting that all three were related.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;

The Baths of Agrippa are the first known to have contained monumental sculpture, including the famous [[Apoxyomenos]] of [[Lysippus]], the famed court sculptor of Alexander the Great. In fact, Pliny the Elder mentions the baths several times, noting that they were "a point of departure in artistic endeavor, implying that the building was perceived as groundbreaking in certain respects".&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; [[File:Apoxeomenos (Vatican Museums) September 2015-1.jpg|thumb|Marble copy of the Apoxyomenos of Lysippus (Pius Clementine Museum, Vatican).]]

The full version of the ''thermae'', or Baths of Agrippa, did not come into use until after the completion of the [[Aqua Virgo]] in 19 BCE.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; This new aqueduct was paid for by Agrippa himself and was one of a series of works connected with Roman water supply and sewers over which Agrippa seems to have had managerial control.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; The [[Aqua Virgo]] is still in use today after almost 2000 years, terminating, and currently supplying the waters to, the [[Trevi Fountain]].&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;Reinhold, Meyer. ''Marcus Agrippa: A Biography''. Geneva: The W.F. Humphrey Press (1933). &lt;/ref&gt; These building projects were a few of the many which Agrippa undertook within the Roman ''[[Campus Martius]]'' and across the Empire, constituting aqueducts, fountains, porticoes, baths, roads, a voting precinct, a theatre, a bridge, and a harbour.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;

Agrippa built up the area around the complex to include gardens with nice walks and colonnades with resting places and shelters from the sun. Wright claims that “The total effect was somewhat like the Athenian ''gymnasia'', the Lyceum, or the grove of Academus, but on a very much larger and more sumptuous scale.”&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; That the bath itself could have served a multitude of functions, serving as a type of club with “a restaurant, a reading-room, and a bathing establishment with every kind of bath then known, hot, tepid, cold, vapour, and shower”.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Wright, F. A.'' Marcus Agrippa: Organizer of Victory''. London: George Routledge &amp; Sons Ltd (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it would appear as though bathing had begun to become more complex around the time of the late Republic going into the early Empire, introducing three different types of rooms and pools: The ''frigidarium'' (cold pool), the ''tepidarium'' (or luke-warm to room temperature pool), and the ''caldarium'' (hot room and pool).&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; Whether or not the ''caldarium'' within the Baths of Agrippa contained window glass to sufficiently heat up the room and keep the heat in, as was the case within the Baths of Trajan and other later examples of Imperial bathing facilities, remains unknown due to the scant archaeological evidence of the site. 

However, the baths, being a highly experimental project within the city of Rome, seem to have lacked a larger swimming pool, present in later Imperial bathing structures.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; It has been pointed out that this need could have been met with the man-made ''Stagnum'' (lake) of Agrippa or, more likely, the ''Euripus'' (canal) which allowed for runoff from the ''Stagnum'' to flow into the Tiber (please see below for more information on both the ''Stagnum'' and the ''Euripus'').
	
Agrippa's baths, along with his other work within the [[Campus Martius]], were burned down in the great fire of 80 AD in the reign of Titus.&lt;ref&gt;Ward-Perkins, J.B. Roman Imperial Architecture. New York: Penguin Books, (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; These appear to have been restored almost immediately during the reigns of either [[Titus]] or [[Domitian]] as [[Martial]] mentions they were often frequented.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold, 1933: 165&lt;/ref&gt; Repairs and rebuilding were completed again under the [[Antonines]] as well as the Severan emperors.&lt;ref name="Claridge"/&gt; There was a further reconstruction during the reign of [[Constantius I|Constantius]] and [[Constans]] in 354-355 AD which was noted on an inscription found near [[Santa Maria in Monterone]], found not far from the west side of the baths.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt;
[[File:Marcus agrippa louvre portrait.jpg|thumb|Marble portrait head of Marcus Agrippa, currently in the Louvre.]]

== Structure and location ==
Knowledge of the structure and location of the Baths of Agrippa is based on a small fragment of the [[Forma Urbis Romae|Marble Plan]] that was discovered in 1900 as well as drawings made in the 16th century of the ruins while they were still standing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today scant archaeological evidence of the Baths remains. 

It was constructed on the [[Campus Martius]] along with the original [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] under Agrippa's large building program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The area covered by the structure was about 110 meters North/South and 90 meters East/West. Along with the rest of Agrippa's buildings, the Baths were surrounded by gardens.

There was a large rotunda (''Arco Della Ciambella'') on the north side of the building 25 meters in diameter, that is visible in the sketches found in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dome was believed to be a social gathering spot for the bathers.

The area west of the rotunda had evidence of a [[hypocaust]] system and hollow terra-cotta tiles, indicating several heated rooms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Adornment ==
The baths were decorated with glazed Terra-cotta tile,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Pliny H.N. XXXV.26&lt;/ref&gt; and with the ''[[Apoxyomenos]]'' of [[Lysippus]] at the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny H.N. XXXV.62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bathing in the Roman World ==

By the late Republic and into the early Principate, bathing within Rome had started to become more complex.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt; This can be traced through Imperial bathing structures, including those of Agrippa, becoming more and more grand and complex. Indeed, some theories suggest that it would appear as though the building of public bathing complexes was not taken on for some time due to the somewhat shady nature of the activities which took place within them. Recent studies have in fact shown that while the building of certain structures was considered virtuous (temples, fora, roads, aqueducts, et cetera), building of other types of structures (brothels, taverns, and other lowly structures) were symbolic of vice.&lt;ref name="Fagan"&gt;Fagan, Garrett G. ''Bathing in Public in the Roman World''. Ann Arbour: The University of Michigan Press (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Through these theories, it would appear as though the building of baths occupied a grayish middle-ground in between, “standing somewhere between useful public monuments and lowly havens of corporeal dissipation”.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; This is a likely explanation as to why there were no senatorially decreed bathing complexes during the Republic. Although senators likely did not avoid the baths altogether, they did not want to spend public money on their construction.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt;
[[File:Thermes trajan.jpg|thumb|Tha later Baths of Trajan showing the frigidarium (N), the tepidarium (F), and the caldarium (C), a form which became popular in the late Republic to early Principate. Whether or not the Baths of Agrippa were symmetrical remains unknown due to the scant archaeological evidence which has survived.]]
Before the completion of the Bath of Agrippa, during the [[Roman Republic]], water which was brought into the city via one of its many aqueducts was not used for baths. Owners of private bathing complexes were forced to purchase water which had run off from publicly accessible troughs.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] innovated here as well, servicing his baths with water fed directly from his freshly built aqueduct, the [[Aqua Virgo]]. However, it must not be forgotten that the Baths of Agrippa began as a private bathing complex as well, paid for personally by [[Marcus Agrippa]] himself who was, by this time, one of the most wealthy men in the Roman world. However, upon his death in 12 BCE, the baths were bequeathed to the Roman people in Agrippa’s will, making it the first public bathing complex in the city of Rome (although not the first in the Empire).&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; This action caused a change in the attitudes within the Senate towards bathing complexes, removing their construction from the grey area and placing them into the realm of virtuous structures, although Agrippa’s example would not be followed until [[Nero]] constructed his baths in the early to mid 60s AD.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt;

Indeed, it would seem as though the technological achievement of the baths was not lost on the Roman people, being able to control and contain vast amounts of water and even control the desired temperature at which certain pools were kept.&lt;ref name="Zajac"/&gt;

Evidence suggests that bathing began to become much more popular within [[Rome]] during the first century BCE, when far greater numbers of Romans began bathing in public with more frequency.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; These numbers would again drastically increase during the first century AD. A passage within [[Varro]] states that when baths were originally introduced within the city of Rome there were separate sections for men and women, which is hinted at archaeologically within Republican baths which often feature an architectural division.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; In a passage of [[Cicero]], detailing a particularly heated exchange between [[L. Licinius Crassus]] and [[M. Junius Brutus]], it is brought to light that it was considered improper at the time for father and son to bathe together.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; However, the passage also indicates that, although the senators were not building baths at the time, they were still frequenting the private bath houses. 

A trip to the Baths of Agrippa, along with other private baths, was meant to be a pleasurable experience. According to [[Lucian]], commenting on a trip to the Baths of Hippias, they were “brightly lit throughout, adorned with marbles from [[Phrygia]] and [[Numidia]], and inscribed with citations from [[Pindar]]”.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; There appears one inscription that mentions a museum which was attached to a bathing complex where art was put on display and where discussions and lectures could be organized.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Indeed, the baths of Rome have been recognized as social hubs within the Roman world, where members of the senatorial class would rub shoulders with the lower classes of society, even slaves, marking a strangely egalitarian feature of Roman life.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt;

The Baths of Agrippa appear to have featured the main three types of pools and rooms which were the staple of Roman baths: the ''frigidarium'' (cold pool), ''tepidarium'' (mild/tepid pool), and ''caldarium'' (hot room and pool). There is research that suggests that these rooms could be visited in both orders, going from cold to hot, or hot to cold.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; The hottest of the rooms, the ''caldarium'', would have relied on both heating from under the floors, created by fanning hot air from fires underneath the water basin, as well as heat from the sun, a feature which exploded after window glass became increasingly popular throughout Rome. It has also been suggested that the ringing of a bell (''tintinabulum'') may have communicated to nearby Romans that the hot pools were open. However, this has also been criticized for various reasons of practicality, preferring the more reasonable explanation that bells were used to mark the imminent clothing of the bathing complex.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Christopher J. “Tintinabulum and Thermae: A Note on Martial”. In Société d’Études Latines de Bruxelles. Vol. 163. pp. 114-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baths in the Roman world were a one-stop-shop of socialization, health, and entertainment. Where one could exercise, play sports or ball games, play board games, philosophize, create business arrangements, and wash away the dirt and grime of everyday life within ancient Rome. There is no doubt that these complexes were microcosms of Roman life and even potentially small embodiments of the Roman world itself.&lt;ref name="Zajac"&gt;Zajac, Natascha. “The thermae: a policy of public health or personal legitimation?” In ''Roman Baths and Bathing'': Part 1. J. DeLaine &amp; D. E. Johnston eds. No. 37. pp. 99-105 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Aqua Virgo ==

[[File:Aqua virgo planlatium 2.jpg|thumb|Route of the Aqua Virgo to Rome. ]]
The [[Aqua Virgo]] was completed in 19 BCE and was the last of a series of constructions initiated by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] concerning water management within the city of Rome.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; Without a proper water supply the Baths of Agrippa would not have been able to function. The [[Aqua Virgo]] provided this water, along with supplying regions VII, IX, and XIV. This complemented the [[Aqua Julia]] which Agrippa also built in 33 B.C. to supply regions II, III, V, VI, VIII, X, and XII.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;Lloyd, Robert B. "The Aqua Virgo, Eripus and Pons Agrippae". In ''American Journal of Archaeology''. Vol. 83. No. 2. pp. 193-204 (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The source of the water transported by the aqueduct was located within the villa of Lucullus, 8 miles from the city along the [[Via Collatina]].&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; In antiquity, the Aqua Virgo travelled past the Baths of Agrippa, bringing water as far as the ''Trans Tiberim'' (across the Tiber), potentially using the ''Pons Agrippae'' (Bridge of Agrippa) to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Shipley, Frederick W. "Agrippa’s Building Activities" in ''Rome''. St. Louis: Washington University Studies - New Series (1933)&lt;/ref&gt; Today the Aqua Virgo is still in use, almost 2000 years after its initial opening, terminating at, and supplying the waters for, the [[Trevi Fountain]].&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;

==   ''Euripus'' ==

The ''Euripus'' was a canal which ran from the area of the [[Stagnum]] and drained into the [[Tiber]]. It was originally thought that Agrippa’s lake was fed exclusively by the [[Aqua Virgo]], using the canal to drain the lake directly into the Tiber.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; However, Strabo’s mention of Agrippa setting up a statue (“The Fallen Lion” of [[Lysippus]]) in a grove which lay between the ''Stagnum'' and the ''Euripus'' leads one to believe that the two were actually distinct features of the landscape.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; Therefore, it seems likely that the canal was indeed fed exclusively by the Aqua Virgo with water that was mentioned to have been quite cold.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; In fact, Frontinus mentions that the waters were given to the ''Euripus'' by the Aqueduct which gave it its name, ''Euripus Virginis'', essentially meaning the canal of the Aqua Virgo.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; Seneca also stated that he enjoyed bringing in the new year with a good-luck plunge into the Virgo, which he did in the ''Euripus''. Thus, as Lloyd has suggested, the ''Euripus'' could have served as a cold plunge-pool for the Baths of Agrippa. The large size of the ''Euripus'' could also imply that it could have stood in as a swimming area for the baths. 

==   ''Stagnum'' ==

The ''Stagnum'', along with the ''Euripus'' were very likely added into the landscape as features to compliment the pleasure gardens which Agrippa placed around his baths.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; The lake is most often placed to the west of the bath structure and, as previously mentioned above, there are, in fact, no references to anyone swimming in the ''Stagnum'', using it in lieu of the lacking swimming pool in the bath structure. Some theories postulate the lake was lined with quays, suggesting that boating on the lake may have been popular.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; The ''Stagnum'' may have been fed by runoff waters from the baths. This runoff of used water would certainly have dissuaded people from swimming in the lake. However, it might appear more likely to some that the Aqua Virgo fed most of the water into the lake.  

The ''Stagnum'' was indeed quite large, being able to host a large banquet for [[Nero]], hosted by Tigillinus, which was held on a raft towed by other boats.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt; The lake could also have served a more practical purpose, serving as a drainage area for the low-lying region of the [[Campus Martius]], which was prone to flooding throughout antiquity.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;

'''[[Bigfoot]]''' or '''Sasquatch''', is an alleged [[ape]]-like creature purportedly inhabiting forests, mainly in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of [[North America]]. More than fifty years have passed since the first supposed sightings of Bigfoot were reported in California. The character of Bigfoot has been used frequently in popular culture including film, TV,  advertising, and literature. Bigfoot has also been the subject of several tourism campaigns.

==Advertising==
"Bigfoot" and "Sasquatch" are pop culture terms that have been used in [[advertising]] across many different products and services, such as pizzas, [[beef jerky]], skateboards, skis, an Internet search engine, a computer hard drive series, gas stations, [[Kokanee beer]], Bigfoot Shadows award winning wine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alleghenycellars.com/bigfoot.html# |title="Allegheny Cellars 2007'' |access-date=2010-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113221810/http://www.alleghenycellars.com/bigfoot.html# |archive-date=2010-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a monster truck.

==Law==
{{Refimprove|date=January 2011}}
[[Skamania County, Washington]] passed a law regarding Bigfoot in 1969 declaring that "any willful, wanton slaying of such creatures shall be deemed a felony" subject to substantial fine and/or imprisonment. The fact that this legislation was passed on April 1 did not escape notice, but County Commissioner Conrad Lundy said that "this is not an [[April Fool's Day]] joke ... there is reason to believe such an animal exists."&lt;ref&gt;Pyle, 278&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date = December 2011}} Hunter and Dahinden mention their own "speculation that Skamania County authorities had their ears tuned much more to the music of a publicity bandwagon than to any song of distress" for Bigfoot.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter and Dahinden, 135-136&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date = December 2011}}  Notwithstanding, the ordinance was amended in 1984 to preclude an [[insanity defense]] and to consider such a killing homicide if the creature was proven by the coroner to be humanoid.&lt;ref&gt;Pyle, 279&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date = December 2011}} 

Complete copies of legislation (May 2015) at http://www.skamaniacounty.org/commissioners/homepage/ordinances-2.&lt;ref&gt;Ordinance 1969-1 and 1984-2 Skamania County, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Al Magnussen from the Mt. Baker Chamber of Commerce, [[Whatcom County, Washington]], an Agenda Bill was drafted (92-247) on 6/9/91, which unanimously passed a resolution declaring Whatcom County a Sasquatch Protection and Refuge Area.&lt;ref&gt;"Resolution No.92-043, Whatcom County Council, Whatcom County, Washington, 98220."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Many have written on the subject, demonstrating a broad spectrum of approaches from a small body of serious scholarly work to lurid [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s, such as the ''[[Weekly World News]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} ''The Gwaii'', published by [[Arcana Studio]], is an award winning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentpublisher.com/article.php?page=1315]&lt;/ref&gt; children's graphic novel that features a sasquatch named Tanu searching for his mother and tribe in the Canadian wilderness.  John Prufrock, the hero of the [[comic book]] [[Proof (comics)|''Proof'']], is a Bigfoot who works for a secret agency that hunts and captures other [[cryptids]]. The comic, an ongoing series, was written by [[Alex Grecian]] and illustrated by [[Riley Rossmo]]. It was published in [[Image Comics]] from October 2007 to May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicvine.com/proof/4050-19722 Proof] at ComicVine.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicvine.com/proof-endangered/4050-37472 Proof Endangered] at ComicVine.com&lt;/ref&gt;  "Donations to Clarity", a 2011 novel by Noah Baird, tells the story of a Bigfoot who falls in love with a Bigfoot hoaxer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secondwindpublishing.com/DonationsToClarity.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101121447/http://secondwindpublishing.com/DonationsToClarity.html |archivedate=2013-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sasquatch appears in the Italian comic series ''[[Tex Willer|Tex]]'' (as a huge wild man with thaumaturgical powers)&lt;ref&gt;''Tex'' #221, 222, 223 (March-May 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Martin Mystère]]''. In the non-canon ''[[Star Wars Tales Volume 5|Star Wars Tales]]'' comic "Into the Great Unknown" - in which the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', after a blind hyperspace jump,'' ''crash-lands on what appears to be [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] but is in fact the Pacific Northwest around the time of [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]], resulting in [[Han Solo]]'s death at the hands of the natives and the eventual discovery of his body by [[Indiana Jones]] (who is disturbed by something "[[Harrison Ford|eerily familiar]]" about the remains) - "Sasquatch" is actually [[Chewbacca]].  One of the main characters from the Canadian [[Marvel Comics]] superhero team [[Alpha Flight]] is [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]]. Famed [[alternate history]] author [[Harry Turtledove]] has written a humorous Sasquatch story titled "Typecasting" (2016), [http://www.tor.com/2016/06/15/typecasting/ published online here]. The version of Bigfoot appearing in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995) reappears in the comic strip "Picture Perfect" of the Brandon J. Santigo [[webcomic]] ''Erma'', playing with Erma Williams, the series' title character. The series is published in conjunction with Outcast Studios.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tapas.io/episode/262209/ ''Erma'' - Picture Perfect]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the poem "Satch" by Jeannette Allée ([[Fence]] literary magazine, Vol. 8,1&amp;2, Summer 2005), Bigfoot is a metaphor for how individuals childishly hide from their own talents, desires, love.

[[Sasquatch Books]] is the largest publishing house in the Pacific Northwest.  Its logo features a Sasquatch paw print.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sasquatchbooks.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Bigfoot has been addressed in American song and music, with both songs written about and by Bigfoot enthusiasts, as well as music incorporating what are claimed to be or supposed to be recordings of Bigfoot sounds made in nature.

*[http://www.allmusic.com/song/i-still-believe-in-bigfoot-the-bigfoot-song-mt0030608588  "The Bigfoot Song:I Still Believe in Bigfoot]", by singer/songwriter Danny Freyer, has become somewhat of an anthem for Bigfoot enthusiasts since it was first released in 2005, and is used in the closing credits of a film forthcoming production titled [[imdbtitle:6048388|"American Bigfoot,]]" which is directed by American comedian [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001281/?ref_=tt_ov_dr Bobcat Goldwait].  The songs lyrics include, "I sill believe in Bigfoot/Don't care what they say/Still believe in apple pie and the good ol' U.S.A," and were written in response to a news article following the death of [http://www.theintelligencer.com/archives/article_141fe00d-d198-5318-8882-37ef9f5c8e92.html Ray Wallace], the man who claimed responsibility for finding Bigfoot evidence. The article quoted Wallace's son stating that his father had perpetrated a hoax, carving the footprints himself. The song highlights the desire of many Bigfoot enthusiasts to believe in Bigfoot, regardless of scientific evidence or lack thereof.

The song "Bigfoot" by the [[Winnipeg]] indie-rock band [[The Weakerthans]] is about the frustration and humiliation of a man who is purported to have seen a Bigfoot.

== Podcasts ==

* [[The Adventure Zone]], a popular real-play RPG podcast, features Bigfoot as a side character in its Amnesty campaign, set in West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maximumfun.org/adventure-zone/adventure-zone-amnesty-episode-2|title=The Adventure Zone: Amnesty - Episode 2 {{!}} Maximum Fun|website=maximumfun.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of [[chirality (chemistry)|chemical chirality]], or the "handedness" of the molecular structure of certain substances, appears in many works of fiction.

==Books==
Although little was known about [[chirality (chemistry)|chemical chirality]] in the time of [[Lewis Carroll]], his work ''[[Through the Looking-glass]]'' contains a prescient reference to the differing biological activities of [[enantiomer]]ic drugs: "Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn't good to drink," Alice said to her cat. A supplemental story to ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' made reference to this, mentioning in passing that after her return from the mirror world, her body was mirror-flipped, presumably down to the molecular level, as she was unable to digest food afterwards.

In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s short story "[[Technical Error]]" (also titled "The Reversed Man"), a technician working on a giant superconducting generator is accidentally "inverted" into his mirror image, right down to the coins in his pocket. When he is found to be starving despite an apparently-healthy diet, the culprit is determined to be the amino acids in his food, which are natural amino acids and opposite in chirality to those his body now requires.

[[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story "[[Left to Right]]" concerns an unknown "change in parity", and mentions biological incompatibilities due to chirality as one possible consequence.

In [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]'s novel ''[[The Documents in the Case]]'', a murder is committed that is designed to appear as accidental death from eating poisonous mushrooms containing [[muscarine]]. The case is proved to be murder because the muscarine found in the deceased's stomach is [[racemic mixture|racemic]] and therefore [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]].

In [[James Blish]]'s Star Trek novella ''[[Spock Must Die!]]'', [[Spock]]'s mirror-duplicate is later discovered to have stolen chemical reagents from the medical bay to convert certain amino acids to opposite-chirality isomers that his metabolism requires.

In [[Spider Robinson]]'s Callahan's Place short story "Mirror/rorriM On the Wall", a mirror is constructed of [[thiotimoline]] which leads to a parallel but inverted universe. A character attempts to smuggle food between the two universes to sell as a diet product, since the amino acids are reversed and provide no [[caloric]] value.

In [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[Destiny's Road]]'', the title planet's indigenous life is based upon [[right-handed protein]]s. When human colonists arrive from Earth via a [[generation ship]], extreme measures are taken to permit the colony's survival. A peninsula is sterilized with a lander's [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] drive, creating the titular "road" out of fused bedrock. The area is then reseeded with Earth life to provide the colonists with food. Though the soil lacks [[potassium]] due to other factors, necessitating supplements that produce a [[hydraulic empire]] common to Niven's fiction, the colony otherwise prospers. Native viruses and bacteria cannot infect colonists, resulting in longer lifespans. Sealife quickly recovers, and is consumed by the colonists as a "diet" food, as their digestive systems cannot metabolize it into fat.

[[Marti Steussy]]'s ''Dreams of Dawn'' (1988) has a similar premise, where the locals evolved based on right-handed [[amino acids]].

The denouement of [[Poul Anderson]]'s ''[[After Doomsday]]'' relies partly on chirality.

The plot of [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[Doorways in the Sand]]'' centers around a device called the Rhennius Machine, which reverses objects that pass through it, down to the atomic level. It is mentioned that an earlier version of the machine destroyed itself by reversing matter to antimatter.

[[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]]'s novel ''[[Change Agent]]'' includes a character "the Mirror man" who is immune to neurotoxins due to his mirrored chirality.

In [[Damon Knight]]'s ''[[A For Anything]]'', Leroy Platt uses a matter duplicator to make food; "Eating the food, too: Why not? Just put it through twice, make sure you don't get any reversed peptide chains."

==Computer games==
In the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series of games, doctors test for a "chiral reaction" in order to determine whether or not a patient is infected with "'''G'''angliated '''U'''trophin '''I'''mmuno '''L'''atency '''T'''oxin," a fictional, parasitic pathogen more commonly referred to as ''GUILT''. A positive reaction means the patient is infected, while a negative reaction means the patient has either been cured or is not infected.

In the video game ''[[Mass Effect]]'', the turian and quarian alien species have biology based upon right-handed amino acids. Because of this, foods from other species which have life forms based upon left-handed amino acids have no nutritional value and may cause fatal allergic reactions. The process works both ways—species based on left-handed acids, such as humans, cannot consume food from the turian or quarian homeworlds. Left-handed amino acids are portrayed as being more common than right-handed versions. The chirality difference is colloquially referred to as "Levo" and "Dextro" by characters in the game.

==Television==
The television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' features the "Heisenberg" method of [[methamphetamine]] manufacture, which produces a 99% chirally pure product.

'''Cornelia James''' is a firm of British [[glove]]makers, founded in 1946, and with a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] since 1979.

==History==
{{see also|Cornelia James (glovemaker)}}
[[Cornelia James (glovemaker)|Cornelia Katz]] was born in Vienna in 1917, and left in 1939 via Paris to London to try to get a United States visa, but met Jack James and married him six weeks later in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gwen Stapleton |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-cornelia-james-1133698.html |title=Obituary: Cornelia James &amp;#124; Culture |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a Jewish refugee and set up business in London in 1946 making gloves. In 1947, [[Norman Hartnell]] asked her to make the "going-away" gloves for the then Princess Elizabeth after her marriage to Prince Phillip.&lt;ref name="cjcom about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corneliajames.com/pages/about-us |title=Cornelia James, About Us |website=Corneliajames.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the company had 250 employees in a former dairy in Brighton.&lt;ref name="nytimes handson"&gt;Susan Fowler, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/style/international/cornelia-james-a-glove-maker-to-the-queen.html Gloves Fit for a Queen, With Hands-On Craftsmanship], ''Nytimes.com'', 23 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39098">'''Cyberpsychology''' (also known as '''Internet psychology''' or '''web psychology''') is a developing field that encompasses all [[psychology|psychological]] phenomena associated with or affected by emerging [[technology]]. ''Cyber'' comes from the word [[cyberspace]], the study of the operation of control and communication; psychology is the study of the mind and behavior.

==Overview==
Cyberpsychology is the study of the human mind and behavior and how the culture of technology, specifically, [[virtual reality]], and social media affect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blascovich|first=Jim|title=Infinite reality: avatars, eternal life, new worlds, and the dawn of the virtual revolution|publisher=William Morrow|location=New York|isbn=0061809500|edition=1st|author2=Bailenson, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream research studies focus on the effect of the Internet and [[cyberspace]] on the psychology of individuals and groups. Some hot topics include: [[online identity]], [[online relationship]]s, personality types in cyberspace, transference to computers, [[addiction to computers]] and Internet, regressive behavior in cyberspace, online gender-switching, etc. Media Psychology is an emerging specialty and the Society for Media Psychology and Technology of the American Psychological Association, i.e., APA division 46 includes many cyber-psychologists among its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apadivisions.org/division-46/index.aspx?_ga=2.104574144.1503209566.1512589570-1547225490.1506141417|title=Society For Media Technology &amp; Psychology|last=|first=|date=2017|website=American Psychological Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While statistical and theoretical research in this field are based around Internet usage, cyberpsychology also includes the study of the psychological ramifications of [[cyborgs]], [[artificial intelligence]], and virtual reality.  Although some of these topics may appear to be the stuff of [[science fiction]], they are quickly becoming [[science]] fact as evidenced by [[interdisciplinary]] approaches in the fields of [[biology]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematics]].  The field of cyberpsychology remains open to refinement, including inquiry into the nature of current and future trends in [[mental illness]] associated with technological advances.

It was around the turn of the millennium that the United States broke the 50 percent mark in Internet use, personal computer use, and cell phone use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cyberpsychology: An Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction|last=Norman|first=Kent L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1-107-10254-5|location=United Kingdom|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; With such a broad exposure to computers and their displays, our perceptions go beyond objects and images in our natural environment to now include graphics and images on the computer screen. As the overlaps between man and machine expand, the relevance of [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI) research within the field of cyberpsychology will become more visible and necessary in understanding the current modern lifestyles of many people. With the rising number of Internet and computer users around the world, computer technology's effects on the human psyche will continue to significantly shape both our interactions with each other and our perceptions of a world literally "at our fingertips".

==Social media and cyberpsychological behavior==
[[File:Growing_Social_Media_Influence_on_Digital_Marketing.jpg|thumb|302x302px|&lt;small&gt;Social media use is rapidly growing. What is it's impact? That is what cyberpsychology seeks to find out.&lt;/small&gt;]]

Although cyberpsychology includes other technological platforms such as cybertherapy and the ramifications of virtual reality, the following section is focused on the effect of social media on human behavior, as it is the most prevalent platform for technology use.

[[Facebook]], the leading online [[social media]] platform globally,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/|title=Global social media ranking 2017 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; affects users' psychological status in multiple ways. Facebook follows the pattern of one-to-many communication which allows users to share information about their lives, including social activities and photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pempek|last2=Yermolayeva|last3=Calvert|journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|title=College students’ social networking experiences on Facebook|volume=30:2|issue=2009|doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2008.12.010|pages=227–238|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature was enhanced in 2012, when [[Facebook Messenger]] was implemented to allow users more one-on-one communication merging with the [[Facebook Chat]] feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Media: A Reference Handbook|last=Burns|first=Kelli S.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4408-4355-6|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Facebook users enjoy the sense of being connected,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Grieve|title=Face-to-Face or Facebook? Can social connectedness be derived online?|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2013|pages=604-6099|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563212003226|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.11.017|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; frequent use of Facebook is threatening users' mental health. Comparison, low self-esteem, depression, loneliness, and negative relationships are all possible detrimental consequences associated with frequent use of Facebook or other social media platforms. 

===Comparison and low self-esteem===
Due to the nature of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc., social media users often compare the lives of their friends with their own. This can be deceptive when the social media user sees only the joyous or entertaining experiences in a friend's life and compares them to his or her own lesser experiences. According to a study published in the ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alexander H. Jordan, Benoît Monin, Carol S. Dweck, Benjamin J. Lovett, Oliver P. John, and James J. Gross|year=2011|title=Misery Has More Company Than People Think: Underestimating the Prevalence of Others' Negative Emotions|url=http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~ajordan/papers/Jordan%20et%20al.%20(2011)%20-%20Misery%20Has%20More%20Company.pdf|deadurl=yes|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=37|issue=1|pages=120–135|doi=10.1177/0146167210390822|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008220618/http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~ajordan/papers/Jordan%20et%20al.%20%282011%29%20-%20Misery%20Has%20More%20Company.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Jordan, and his colleagues at Stanford University asked 80 freshmen to report whether they or their peers had recently experienced various negative or positive emotional events. Consistently, participants underestimated how many negative experiences ("had a distressing fight", "felt sad because they missed people", etc.) their peers were having while overestimating how much fun ("going out with friends", "attending parties", etc.) these same peers experienced. A similar study conducted at Stanford University showed that underestimating peers negative experiences correlated with greater loneliness and lower overall [[life satisfaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Alexander H.|last2=Monin|first2=Benoît|last3=Dweck|first3=Carol S.|last4=Lovett|first4=Benjamin J.|last5=John|first5=Oliver P.|last6=Gross|first6=James J.|title=Misery Has More Company Than People Think: Underestimating the Prevalence of Others’ Negative Emotions|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.erl.lib.byu.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167210390822|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=120–135|doi=10.1177/0146167210390822|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inviting constant comparisons inevitably lowers self-esteem and feelings of self-worth, hence, Facebook and other social media accounts appear to exploit an Achilles' heel of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/01/the_antisocial_network.html|title=The Anti-Social Network|last1=Copeland|first1=Libby|website=Slate.com|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression===
Decreased self-esteem can increase depression. Facebook specifically is criticized for causing depression, especially among teenage users. A study conducted by [[Michigan University]] consisting of 82 Facebook users over a two-week period, concluded that frequent Facebook use invoked feelings of depression and inadequacy. Social psychologist Ethan Kross, the lead author of the study, stated that the research tracked (on a moment-to-moment basis throughout the day) how a person's mood fluctuated during time spent on Facebook, and whether or not they modified their Facebook usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityherald.com/articles/4230/20130816/facebook-use-bad-self-esteem-matter-why-log.htm|title=Facebook Use Bad For Self-Esteem No Matter Why You Log On|last1=Westerholm|first1=Russell|website=University Herald|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results suggest that as participants spent more time on Facebook, their feelings of well-being decreased and feelings of depression increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guardianlv.com/2013/08/facebook-causes-depression-new-study-says/#PzRdcP38KPwjLoxo.9|title=Facebook Cause Depression New Study Says|last1=Savastio|first1=Rebecca|website=Liberty Voie|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a study conducted at the University of Pittsburgh consisting of 1,787 participants between 19–32 years of age showed that participants in the highest quartile for social media site visits per week were at an increased likelihood of experiencing depression.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu yi Lin, Jaime E. Sidani, Ariel Shensa, Ana Radovic, Elizabeth Miller, et al.|first=|date=2016|title=Association Between Social Media Use and Depression Among U.S. Young Adults|url=|journal=Depression and Anxiety|volume=33|pages=323–331|via=PsychINFO|doi=10.1002/da.22466|pmc=4853817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social isolation and ostracism ===
According to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], [[social interaction]] and belonging are important aspects of psychological and emotional well-being. Although it is relatively common to have hundreds of friends on Facebook, it is unlikely that any one individual has that many solid person to person relationships. This can create social disconnect. Different from meeting friends face to face, chatting with an acquaintance or a total stranger online can increase feelings of loneliness instead of increasing feelings of social connection. This may be because Facebook uses of the "like" and "comment" button as means of interaction is too brief and does not show lasting concern. In the 2016 University of Pittsburgh study mentioned previously&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; researched found that excessive social media usage increased feelings of social isolation, that is, as authentic social interactions were replaced by virtual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/03/06/much-social-media-increases-loneliness-envy-study/|title=Too much social media 'increases loneliness and envy' - study|last=Molloy|first=Mark|date=2017-03-06|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a 2011 study conducted at the [[University College of London]] examined the [[fMRI]] brain scans of 125 frequent Facebook users and found that the size of an individual's online social network is closely linked to brain structure associated with social cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kanai|first=R.|last2=Bahrami|first2=B.|last3=Roylance|first3=R.|last4=Rees|first4=G.|date=2011-10-19|title=Online social network size is reflected in human brain structure|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/10/12/rspb.2011.1959|journal=Proc. R. Soc. B|language=en|pages=rspb20111959|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.1959|issn=0962-8452|pmid=22012980|volume=279|pmc=3282379}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research provides evidence that social media platforms, such as Facebook, are changing the way people socialize, and that it may not be fulfilling social needs. 

Additionally, 2012 research data from Purdue University indicates that [[social rejection]] or [[ostracism]] in an [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersive virtual environment]] threatens four basic fundamental needs (i.e., belonging, control, self-esteem, and meaningful existence) and thus, has a negative impact on [[affect (psychology)|affect]] (emotion). This research suggests the possibility that individuals who use virtual environments (e.g., MMORPGs, [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s) may have everyday experiences with ostracism in these environments. This study presents the first known evidence of ostracism in virtual environments and revealed the effects of ostracism in virtual environments as powerful with effect sizes medium to large in magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Matthew P. Kassner, M.S.|author2=Eric D. Wesselmann, Ph.D.|author3=Alvin Ty Law, M.S.|author4=Kipling D. Williams, Ph.D.|date=2012|title=Virtually Ostracized: Studying Ostracism in Immersive Virtual Environments|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc|volume=15|issue=8|pages=399–403|doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0113|pmc=3422048|pmid=22897472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negative relationships===
Facebook has also been linked to the increased divorce and break-up rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clayton|first1=Russell B.|last2=Nagurney|first2=Alexander|last3=Smith|first3=Jessica R.|title=Cheating, Breakup, and Divorce: Is Facebook Use to Blame?|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|date=October 2013|volume=16|issue=10|pages=717–720|doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Couples that fit this trend tend to express feelings of jealousy when their partner comment on a person of the opposite gender's wall. To cope with the uncertainty of a suspected romantic relationship, partner surveillance on Facebook is becoming more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Tara C.|last2=Bejanyan|first2=Kathrine|last3=Di Castro|first3=Gaia|last4=Lee|first4=Ruth A.|date=2013-03-01|title=Attachment styles as predictors of Facebook-related jealousy and surveillance in romantic relationships|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6811.2011.01393.x/abstract|journal=Personal Relationships|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.2011.01393.x|issn=1475-6811}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, skepticism between couples may inevitably cause the end of relationship. Russell B. Clayton, Alexander Nagurney and Jessica R. Smith, surveyed 205 Facebook users aged 18–82 to determine if frequent Facebook use predicated negative relationship outcomes. Furthermore, the researchers examined length of relationship as a moderator variable in the aforementioned model. The results indicate that a high level of Facebook usage is associated with negative relationship outcomes, and that these relationships are indeed mediated by Facebook-related conflict. This series of relationships only holds for those who are, or have been, in relatively newer relationships of 3 years or less. The current study adds to the growing body of literature investigating Internet use and relationship outcomes, and may be a precursor to further research investigating whether Facebook use attributes to the divorce rate, emotional cheating, and physical cheating.

It is important to note that these findings do not demonstrate causality. A similar study demonstrated that relationship maintenance behaviors, such as surveillance and monitoring, were indicators of current levels of trust within the relationship.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Margaret C.|last2=Dainton|first2=Marianne|last3=Goodboy|first3=Alan K.|date=2014-01-01|title=Maintaining Relationships on Facebook: Associations with Uncertainty, Jealousy, and Satisfaction|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/08934215.2013.845675|journal=Communication Reports|volume=27|issue=1|pages=13–26|doi=10.1080/08934215.2013.845675|issn=0893-4215}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that certain behaviors on social media may be predicting these negative relationships, rather than causing them. Further, the study also showed that Facebook can be a tool in strengthening and reaffirming a relationship, as it allows for positive expressions of trust, affection and commitment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Fear of missing out (FOMO)===
{{main article|Fear of missing out}}
A byproduct of social media addiction is the "fear of missing out", or FOMO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Larry Ph.D.|title= Always On, All the Time: Are We Suffering From FoMO?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rewired-the-psychology-technology/201305/always-all-the-time-are-we-suffering-fomo|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Rewired: The Psychology of Technology|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fear develops from a user's repetitive and obsessive status-checking of "friend" status updates and posts related to social events or celebrations resulting in a feeling of being "left out" if these events are not experienced.  There is also the closely related fear of being missed (FOBM), or the fear of invisibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Jenny|title=From 'hyper' to 'in': on visibility|url=http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/12/05/from-hyper-to-in-on-visibility/|website=thesocietypages.org|publisher=Cyborgology|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fear involves an obsessive need to provide constant status updates on one's own personal, day-to-day life, movements, travel, events, etc. unable to "un-plug". There is evidence that suggests this type of anxiety is a mediating factor in both increased social media use and decreased self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://search.lib.virginia.edu/articles/article?id=edselp:S0747563216306902|title=Motivators of Online Vulnerability: The Impact of Social Network Site Use and FOMO|author1=Buglass, Sarah L.|author2=Binder, Jens F.|author3=Betts, Lucy R.|author4=Underwood, Jean D.M.|journal=

Computers in Human Behavior|date=January 2017|volume=66|pp=248–255|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sleep deprivation===
Research suggests that social networking can lead to sleep deprivation. A study commissioned by Travelodge hotels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126143839/http://www.travelodge.co.uk/press_releases/press_release.php?id=408|url=http://www.travelodge.co.uk/press_releases/press_release.php?id=408|title=Bedtime Social Networking Causes Sleep Deprivation Epidemic Across Britain|archivedate=26 November 2011|publisher=|date=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United Kingdom surveyed 6,000 adults to explore the nation's bedtime habits and key findings revealed 'we' have become a nation of 'Online-A-Holics'. On average each night Britons are spending 16 minutes in bed socially networking with pals – with the peak chatting time being 9:45 pm. This time spent social networking is affecting Britons sleep quota as on average respondents reported they are getting just six hours and 21 minutes sleep per night. (This is one hour and 39 minutes below the recommended quota of eight hours of sleep per night.)  Further research findings revealed that 65% respondents stated the very last thing they do before nodding off at night is checking their mobile phone for text messages. On average Britons will spend around nine minutes every night texting before falling asleep, and four out of ten adults reported they have a regular text communication with friends in bed every night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Addiction to Social Networking Leads to Sleep Deprivation|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20120218/Addiction-to-social-networking-leads-to-sleep-deprivation.aspx|website=News Medical|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addictive behavior===
{{see also|Internet addiction disorder}}
Recent studies have shown a connection between online social media such as Facebook use to addictive behaviors, emotion regulation, impulse control, and substance abuse. This may be because people are learning to access and process information more rapidly and to shift attention quickly from one task to the next. All this access and vast selection is causing some entertainment seekers to develop the constant need for instant gratification with a loss of patience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jaclyn Cabral|date=2011|title=Is Generation Y Addicted to Social Media?|url=http://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/academics/communications/research/vol2no1/01Cabral.pdf|journal=The Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in Communications|volume=2|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from a survey of university undergraduates showed that almost 10% met criteria for what investigators describe as "disordered social networking use".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hackethal|first1=Veronica MD.|title=Social Media Potentially Addictive, Linked to Substance Abuse|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/836660|website=Medscape|accessdate=7 February 2015|date=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents who met criteria for "Facebook addiction" also reported statistically significant symptoms commonly linked to addiction, such as tolerance (increased Facebook use over time), withdrawal (irritability when unable to access Facebook), and cravings to access the site. "Our findings suggest that there may be shared mechanisms underlying both substance and behavioral addictions," Hormes added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.12713/abstract | title=Craving Facebook?

A results of a study in the journal of ''Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking'' (2014) provided evidence that the prevalence of internet addiction varies considerably between countries and is inversely related to quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng Cecilia and Li Angel Yee-lam.

===Eating disorders===
A study conducted by the University of Haifa in 2011 showed that the more time teenage girls spend on Facebook, the higher their risk of developing negative body images and eating disorders. A more recent study by researchers at Florida State University found a correlation between Facebook use and disordered eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fsu.edu/indexTOFStory.html?lead.facebook_study | title=Hungry for 'likes': Facebook use linked to eating disorder risk | publisher=Florida State University | date=March 6, 2014 | accessdate=March 23, 2016 | author=Elish, Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rojas|first1=Marcela|title=Social Media Helps Fuel Some Eating Disorders|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/01/social-media-helps-fuel-eating-disorders/9817513/|website=USA Today|publisher=The (Westchester County, N.Y.) Journal News|accessdate=6 February 2015|date=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers examined the relationship between college women's media use and two sets of variables (disordered-eating symptomatology and a set of related variables, including body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness) and assessed the relationship between college men's media use and their endorsement of thinness for themselves and for women. We expected to find consumption of thinness-depicting and thinness-promoting (TDP) media related to disordered eating and thinness endorsement, with the social learning process of modeling accounting for the relationships. For women, media use predicted disordered-eating symptomatology, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, and ineffectiveness. For men, media use predicted endorsement of personal thinness and dieting and select attitudes in favor of thinness and dieting for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=K Harrison|author2=J Cantor|title=Journal of Communication|date=February 7, 2006|volume= 47|issue= 1|pages=40–67|url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1111%2Fj.1460-2466.1997.tb02692.x?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Social media and ADHD ===
In the view of Dr. Robert Melillo, a [[Neurology|chiropractic neurologist]] and founder of the [[Brain Balance|&lt;u&gt;Brain Balance Program&lt;/u&gt;]], the environment strongly affects the development of ADHD. Although many factors contribute to ADHD (including genes, teratogens, parenting styles, etc.) a sedentary lifestyle centered on television, computer games, and mobile devices may increase the risk for ADHD. Specifically, "When kids play computer games, their minds are processing information in a much different way than kids who are, say, running around on a playground...Recent studies have shown that playing computer games only builds very short-term attention that needs to be rewarded frequently." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Disconnected Kids|last=Melillo|first=Dr. Robert|publisher=Perigee|year=2015|isbn=978-0-399-53475-1|location=United States|pages=60-80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Clinical psychologist Michelle Frank, who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in college students, young adults, and women, stated, "The ADHD brain is already one that struggles with motivation, activation, organizing behaviors, managing time, and maintaining focus...Technology, left un-managed, makes these struggles considerably more difficult. The unique challenges that result are prime vulnerabilities to the common pitfalls of technology use."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Frank explained that an individual with ADHD has structural, functional, and chemical differences compared to a neurotypical brain. 

These differences explain why ADHD individuals may be more prone to engage in risky or unhelpful behaviors online and struggle to control spontaneous impulses without thinking of future consequences. The ADHD brain is primed to seek out more stimulation that neurotypical brains, and technology is a ripe source of engagement. For these reasons, there is an emerging body of research that suggests that internet addiction and unhealthy social media activity may be more prevalent in ADHD individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another compounding piece of the social media puzzle is related to time management. Individuals with ADHD have trouble with awareness of time, procrastination, avoidant behaviors, and staying on task. Frank explains that ADHD individuals often misperceive time and have trouble thinking into the future; NOW is the dominant time zone. Therefore, time management is a challenge.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crowell|first1=Grant|title=Social Media and ADHD: Turning Distractions into Directions|url=http://www.add.org/?page=Social_Media_n_ADHD|website=ADD.org|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, Ju-Yu Yen at Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital in Taiwan discovered that being easily bored rather than easily distracted is the core symptom of inattentive ADHD. Internet activities are based highly upon their interactivity levels and immediate response rates; these quick actions relieve the feeling of boredom. In other words, the internet becomes a coping mechanism for those who cannot focus. Research concluded that male college students are more likely to be screened positively for adult ADHD; however, the overall association between Internet addiction and attention deficit is more significant in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yen|first1=Ju-Yu|date=2009|title=The Association Between Adult ADHD Symptoms and Internet Addiction Among College Students|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=12|issue=2|pages=189|doi=10.1089/cpb.2008.0113}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Positive correlates of social media use===
Research conducted by Australian researchers demonstrated that a number of positive psychological outcomes are related to Facebook use.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://theconversation.com/thumbs-up-facebook-might-actually-be-good-for-you-11889 Thumbs up: Facebook might actually be good for you]&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers established that people can derive a sense of social connectedness and belongingness in the online environment. Importantly, this online social connectedness was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, and greater levels of subjective well-being. These findings suggest that the nature of online social networking determines the outcomes of online social network use.
===Social media and memes===
A consequent component of the social media experience is [[Internet meme|internet memes]]. As the internet acquired its own variety of memes and language, intellectual convergence became apparently existent in the minds of internet users. Digital inhabitants have voluntarily created various requirements and standards that must be met for a successful interaction. The distinguishing judgment of others is implied in the sharing of memes, and this judgment leads to differences in social existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Julien|first=Chris|title=Bourdieu, Social Capital and Online Interaction|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038038514535862|journal=Sociology|language=en|volume=49|issue=2|pages=356–373|doi=10.1177/0038038514535862|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of information infection through internet memes can influence the ways internet users will acquire and interpret data. This in turn affects their participation, interactions, and behaviors online and offline.

While internet memes appear to be simple pop culture references, they allow a glimpse into the formation of culture and language when more closely observed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/860711989|title=Memes in digital culture|last=1974-|first=Shifman, Limor,|isbn=0262525437|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=860711989}}&lt;/ref&gt; These snippets of pop-culture serve to demonstrate how the collective mind of internet users relate to one another through seemingly ridiculous images and text. Despite the absurdity of some memes, they allow connections to be built through a shared experience. This shared experience is central to the development of the culture of the modern internet and those who primarily connect with others through it. This also shapes the culture of future generations as they become more enmeshed within this globalized culture and psyche.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Psychotherapy in cyberspace ==
Psychotherapy in cyberspace, also known as cybertherapy or e-therapy, is a controversial matter with a history of doubts related to efficiency, validity and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ciccarelli|first1=Saundra K.|last2=White|first2=J. Noland|title=Psychology|isbn=9780205832576}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first instance of this practice did not include interaction with a human, but rather a program called [[ELIZA]], which was designed by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]] to answer questions and concerns with basic Rogerian responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duggan|first=Geoffrey B.|date=2016-07-02|title=Applying psychology to understand relationships with technology: from ELIZA to interactive healthcare|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2016.1141320|journal=Behaviour &amp; Information Technology|volume=35|issue=7|pages=536–547|doi=10.1080/0144929X.2016.1141320|issn=0144-929X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ELIZA proved to be so effective that many people either mistook the program for human, or became emotionally attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suler|first=John R.|date=2000-04-01|title=Psychotherapy in Cyberspace: A 5-Dimensional Model of Online and Computer-Mediated Psychotherapy|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/109493100315996|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=2|pages=151–159|doi=10.1089/109493100315996|issn=1094-9313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In today's most common computer-mediated form of counseling, a person e-mails or chats online with a therapist ([[online counseling]]). E-therapy may be particularly effective when conducted via video conferencing, as important cues such as facial expression and body language may be conveyed albeit in a less ''present'' way. At the same time, there are new applications of technology within psychology and healthcare which utilize augmented and virtual reality components—for example in pain management treatment, PTSD treatment, use of avatars in virtual environments, and self- and clinician-guided computerized cognitive behavior therapies.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.fenichel.com/psychtech2011.shtml Technology and Psychology 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The voluminous work of Azy Barak&lt;ref&gt;Barak, A., &amp; Suler, J.

Suler (Eds.), ''Psychological aspects of cyberspace: Theory, Research, Applications'' (pp. 1–12). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|9780521873017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[University of Haifa]]) and a growing number of researchers in the US and UK gives strong evidence to the efficacy (and sometimes superiority) of Internet-facilitated, computer-assisted treatments relative to 'traditional' in-office-only approaches. The UK's National Health Service now recognizes CCBT (computerized cognitive behavioral therapy) as the preferred method of treatment for mild-to-moderate presentations of anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.fenichel.com/CCBT.shtml August 2011 presentation by Kate Cavanaugh, author of "Hands on Help"]&lt;/ref&gt; Applications in psychology and medicine also include such innovations as the "Virtual Patient" and other virtual/augmented reality programs which can provide trainees with simulated intake sessions while also providing a means for supplementing clinical supervision.

Many of the current controversies related to e-therapy have arisen in the context of ethical guidelines and considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-usr.rider.edu/~suler/psycyber/therapy.html/ John Suler's The Psychology of Cyberspace -Psychotherapy in Cyberspace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206032439/http://www-usr.rider.edu/~suler/psycyber/therapy.html |date=2008-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. there are special circumstances which impact widespread online services among licensed health/mental health professionals given that each of 50 states has their own licensing and regulatory systems, and for most professions practitioners are limited to practicing 'within their state', with the recipient's location determining 'where the service is received' and spurring ongoing debate about restricted access and antiquity of the license system. But the applications and research expand at a rapid rate, and areas of research, practice, and education within the world of 'psychotherapy' have been exploding – especially with all of the research and experience demonstrating the value of technology/Internet assisted applications.

A '''dame school''' was an early form of a private [[elementary school]] in English-speaking countries. They were usually taught by women and were often located in the home of the teacher.

== Britain ==
[[File:A Dames School (2781207528).jpg|thumb|A dame school; photograph by P. H. Emerson]]
Dame schools were small, private schools run by working class women and occasionally men in their own homes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-yOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Dame+schools+england&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSvvaa0O3ZAhXuqFkKHdBBCQMQ6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Dame%20schools%20england&amp;f=false|title=Women's History: Britain, 1850-1945: An Introduction|last=Purvis|first=June|date=2008-01-28|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135367107|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  References to dame schools can be found from the 16th century onward.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/middx/vol1/pp213-240|title=The Education of the Working Classes to 1870|last1=Cockburn|last2=King|website=British History on Line|last3=MacDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dame schools often had a poor reputation and were often seen as a cheap form of daycare.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The London inspector of the British and Foreign School Society in 1838 wrote that "in the dame schools they cannot teach reading."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1861 the [[Newcastle Commission]] reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The number of children whose names ought (in summer 1858 in England and Wales) to have been on the school books, in order that all might receive some education, was 2,655,767.  The number we found to be actually on the books was 2,535,462, thus leaving 120,305 children without any school instruction whatever.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
They looked at the previous year's data and found that 2,213,694 children of the poorer classes were in elementary day schools. But of this number: 
*573,536 were attending private schools, such as Dame schools where a woman provided child care facilities and a little reading, writing and arithmetic in her own home. These failed to give the children an education which would be serviceable to them in after-life. 
*The other 1,549,312 children were attending public elementary day schools belonging to the religious denominations (church schools), but all but 19.3% were under 12, so were in primary departments. Only 300,000 were receiving any form of extended education, which was believed to be essential. 
*As many as 786,202 attend for less than 100 days in the year and can therefore hardly receive a serviceable amount of education
*A large proportion of the teaching was inefficiently done
*"Much, therefore, still remains to be done to bring up the state of elementary education in England and Wales to the degree of usefulness which we all regard as attainable and desirable" {{sfn|Gillard|2017|loc=Section 3}}

Most dame schools largely closed with the implementation of the [[1870 Elementary Education Act]].

== North America ==

In North America, "dame school" is a broad term for a private school with a female teacher during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The education provided by these schools ranged from basic to exceptional.&lt;ref&gt;Perlmann, Joel, and Robert Margo. Women's work?: American schoolteachers, 1650-1920. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (2001), 9&lt;/ref&gt; The basic type of dame school was more common in [[New England]], where basic literacy was expected of all classes, than in the southern colonies, where there were fewer educated women willing to be teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, Kimberley. Transformations in schooling: historical and comparative perspectives. New York: Macmillan (2007), 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivated by the religious needs of [[Puritan]] society and their own economic needs, some colonial women in 17th century rural New England opened small, private schools in their homes to teach reading and catechism to young children. An education in reading and religion was required for children by the [[Massachusetts School Law of 1642]]. This law was later strengthened by the famous [[Old Deluder Satan Law|Old Deluder Satan Act]]. According to Puritan beliefs, Satan would assuredly try to keep people from understanding the Scriptures, therefore it was deemed that all children be taught how to read. Dame schools fulfilled this requirement if parents were unable to educate their young children in their own home. For a small fee, women, often housewives or widows, offered to take in children to whom she would teach a little writing, reading, basic prayers and religious beliefs. These women received ''"tuition"'' in coin, home industries, alcohol, baked goods and other valuables. Teaching materials generally included, and often did not exceed, a [[hornbook]], primer, [[Psalter]] and [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Elizabeth P. "Dame Schools". In Encyclopedia of Educational Reform and Dissent, Thomas Hunt, Thomas Lasley and C D. Raisch, 259-260. SAGE Publications (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Both girls and boys were provided education through the dame school system. Dame schools generally focused on the [[Three R's|four R's of education]]-''Riting, Reading, Rithmetic, and Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, K. R., &amp; Cooper, J. M. C. (2010). Colonial origins. In L. Mafrici (Ed.), Those who can teach (12th ed.). Boston, MA: Wadsworth Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to primary education, girls in dame schools might also learn sewing, embroidery, and other "graces".&lt;ref&gt;Forman-Brunell, Miriam. Girlhood in America: An Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO (2001), 575.&lt;/ref&gt; Most girls received their only formal education from dame schools because of sex-segregated education in common or public schools during the colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Hilary J. Schooling citizens: the struggle for African American education in antebellum America. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (2009), 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  If their parents could afford it, after attending a dame school for a rudimentary education in reading, colonial boys moved on to [[grammar school]]s where a male teacher taught advanced arithmetic, writing, Latin and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Zhboray, Ronald. A fictive people: antebellum economic development and the American reading public. New York: Oxford University Press (1993), 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th and 19th centuries, some dame schools offered boys and girls from wealthy families a "polite education". The women running these elite dame schools taught "reading, writing, English, French, arithmetic, music and dancing".&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jack and Rosemary Brana-Shute, and Randy J. Sparks, eds.

New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools for upper-class girls were usually called

'''Dataveillance''' is the practice of monitoring and collecting online data as well as metadata.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Dijck|first=José|year=2014|title=Datafication, dataism and dataveillance: Big Data between scientific paradigm and ideology|url=http://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society/article/view/datafication|journal=Surveillance &amp; Society|volume=12|issue=2|pages=|issn=1477-7487|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a portmanteau of data and surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biometrics: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|last=Resources|first=Management Association, Information|date=August 30, 2016|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-5225-0984-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dataveillance is concerned with the continuous monitoring of users' communications and actions across various platforms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Roger A.|year=1988|title=Information Technology and Dataveillance|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=31|issue=5|pages=498–511|doi=10.1145/42411.42413}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, dataveillance refers to the monitoring of data  resulting from credit card transactions, GPS coordinates, emails, [[social network]]s, etc. Using [[digital media]] often leaves traces of data and creates a [[digital footprint]] of our activity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Selwyn|first=Neil|year=2014|title=Data entry: towards the critical study of digital data and education|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439884.2014.921628|journal=Learning, Media and Technology|publisher=Routledge|volume=40|issue=1|pages=64–82|doi=10.1080/17439884.2014.921628|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of surveillance is not often known and happens discreetly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Roger|year=1996|title=Privacy and dataveillance, and organizational strategy|journal=Proceedings of the IS Audit &amp; Control Associate Conference|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[sousveillance]], where individuals willingly reveal their activity, dataveillance is more discrete and unknown. Dataveillance may involve the surveillance of groups of individuals. There exist three types of dataveillance: ''personal dataveillance, mass dataveillance,'' and ''facilitiative mechanisms''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike [[computer and network surveillance]], which collects data from computer networks and hard drives, dataveillance monitors and collects data (and metadata) through social networks and various other online platforms. Dataveillance is not to be confused with electronic surveillance. Electronic surveillance refers to the surveillance of oral and audio systems such as wire tapping.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, electronic surveillance depends on having suspects already presumed before surveillance can occur.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On the other hand, dataveillance can use data to identify an individual or a group.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frikken|first=Keith B.|last2=Atallah|first2=Mikhail J.|year=2003|title=Privacy preserving electronic surveillance|journal=Proceedings of the 2003 ACM workshop on Privacy in the electronic society.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, these individuals and groups have sparked some form of suspicion with their activity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Types ==
The types of dataveillance are separated by the way data is collected, as well as the number of being individuals associated with it.

'''''Personal Dataveillance:''''' Personal dataveillance refers to the collection and monitoring of a person's personal data. Personal dataveillance can occur when an individual's data causes a suspicion or has attracted attention in some way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Personal data can include information such as birth date, address, social security (or social insurance) number, as well as other [[unique identifier]]s.

'''''Mass Dataveillance:''''' Refers to the collection of data on groups of people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general distinction between mass dataveillance and personal dataveillance is the surveillance and collection of data as a group rather than an individual.

'''''Facilitative Mechanisms:''''' Unlike mass dataveillance a group is not targeted. An individual's data is placed into a system or database along with various others where computer matching can unveil distinct patterns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An individuals data is never considered to part of a group in this instance.

== Benefits and concerns ==
===Pros===
There are many concerns and benefits associated with dataveillance. Dataveillance can be useful for collecting and verifying data in ways that are beneficial. For instance, personal dataveillance can be utilized by financial institutions to track fraudulent purchases on credit card accounts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This has the potential to prevent and regulate fraudulent financial claims and resolve the issue.

Comparing to traditional methods of surveillance, dataveillance tends to be an economical approach, since it can help monitor more information in a less amount of time. In this case, the responsibility of monitoring is transferred to computers, therefore reducing time and human labors in the process of surveilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Roger|date=May 1988|title=INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATAVEILLANCE|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=42413|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=31|issue=5|pages=498–512|issn=0001-0782|via=ACM Digital Library|doi=10.1145/42411.42413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dataveillance has also been useful in assessing security threats associated with terrorism. Authorities have utilized dataveillance to help them understand and predict potential terrorist or criminal threats.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dataveillance is very important to the concept of [[predictive policing]]. Since predictive policing requires a great deal of data to operate effectively and dataveillance can do just that. Predictive policing allows police to intervene in potential crimes to create safer communities and better understand potential threats.

Businesses also rely on dataveillance to help them understand the online activity for potential clients by tracking their online activity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashworth|first=Laurence|last2=Free|first2=Clinton|date=August 26, 2006|title=Marketing Dataveillance and Digital Privacy: Using Theories of Justice to Understand Consumers’ Online Privacy Concerns|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-006-9007-7|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|language=en|volume=67|issue=2|pages=107–123|doi=10.1007/s10551-006-9007-7|issn=0167-4544}}&lt;/ref&gt; By tracking their online activity through cookies, as well as various other methods, businesses are able to better understand what sort of advertisements work with their existing and potential clients.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; While making online transactions users often give away their information freely which is later used by the company for corporate or private interests.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsesis|first=Alexander|year=2014|title=The Right to Erasure: Privacy, Data Brokers, and the Indefinite Retention of Data|url=|journal=Scientific American|volume=49|pages=433–484|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; For businesses this information can help boost sales and attract attention towards their products to help generate revenue.

===Cons===
On the other hand, there are many concerns that arise with dataveillance. Dataveillance assumes that our technologies and data are a true reflection of ourselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This presents itself as a potential concern given that it can be believed that our data is true to our own actions and behaviours .&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amoore|first=Louise|last2=Goede|first2=Marieke De|title=Governance, risk and dataveillance in the war on terror|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10611-005-1717-8|journal=Crime, Law and Social Change|language=en|volume=43|issue=2–3|pages=149–173|doi=10.1007/s10611-005-1717-8|issn=0925-4994|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This becomes a critical concern when associated with the surveillance of criminal suspects and terrorist groups. Authorities who monitor these suspects would then assume that the data they have collected reflects their actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This helps to understand potential or past threats for criminals as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is also the lack of transparency and privacy with companies who collect and share their user's data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is a critical issue with both the trust and belief of the data and its uses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many social networks have argued that their user's forfeit part of their privacy in order to provide their service for free.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Several of these companies choose not to fully disclose what data is collected and who it is shared with. When data is volunteered to companies it is difficult to know what companies have gain data about you and your online activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Much of an individual's data is shared with websites and social networks in order to provide a more customized marketing experience. Many of those social networks may share your information with intelligent  agencies and authorities without a user's knowledge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since the recent scandal involving Edward Snowden and National Security Agency it has been revealed that authorities may have access to more data from various devices and platforms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It has become very difficult to know what will happen with your data or what specifically has been collected. It is also important to recognize that while online users are worried about their information many of those same worries are not always applied to their activities or behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ragnedda|first=Massimo|date=January 1, 2015|title=Electronic surveillance on Social Networking Sites. A critical case study of the usage of SNSs by students in Sassari, Italy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1424489615000363|journal=Studies in Communication Sciences|volume=15|issue=2|pages=221–228|doi=10.1016/j.scoms.2015.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; With social networks collecting a large amount of personal data such as birth date, legal name, sex, and photos there is an issue of dataveillance compromising confidentiality. Ultimately, dataveillance can comprise online anonymity.

Despite dataveillance compromising anonymity, anonymity itself presents a crucial issue. Online criminals who steal users' data and information may exploit it for their own gain. Tactics used by online users to conceal their identity make it difficult for others to track the criminal behavior and lay claim to those responsible. Having unique identifiers such as IP addresses allows for the identification of users actions, which are often used to track illegal online activity such as [[Online piracy|piracy]].

While dataveillance may help businesses market their products to existing and potential clients there are concerns over how and who has access to customer data. When visiting a business's website often install cookies onto users' devices. [[HTTP cookie|Cookies]] have been a new way for businesses to obtain data on potential customers since it allows them to track their online activities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Companies may also look to sell information they have collected on their clients to third parties.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Since clients are not notified about these transactions it becomes difficult to know where your data has been sold. Furthermore, since dataveillance is discrete clients are very unlikely to know the exact nature of the data that has been either collected or sold.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Education on tracking tools such as cookies presents a critical issue. If businesses or online services are unwilling to define cookies or educate their users as to why they used many may unwillingly accept them.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grey Web: Dataveillance Vision Fulfilled Through the Evolving Web|last=Gomer|first=R.C.|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue stemming from companies and other agencies which collect personal data and information is that they have now engaged in the practices of data brokering. [[Data brokers]], such as [[Acxiom]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, collect users; information and are known for often selling that information to third parties. While companies may disclose that they are collecting data or online activity from their users it is usually not comprehensible by everyday users.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is difficult for everyday people to spot this disclosure since it is hidden by jargon and writing most often understood by lawyers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is now becoming a new source of revenue for companies.

In terms of [[predictive policing]], the proper use of crime data and the combination of offline practices and technology have also become the challenges for police institutions. Too much reliance on the result brought up by big data may lead to the subjective judgement of police, and may reduce the amount of real-time on site communication between local police officers and residents in particular areas, thus decreasing the opportunity for the police to investigate and cruise in local communities at a frequent basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/socialmediadna/predictive-policing-ibm|title=Predictive Policing—Preventing Crime with Data and Analyticcs|last=IBM Center for The Business of Government|first=|date=Oct 25, 2013|website=Slideshare|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, data security still remains to be a huge dilemma, considering the access to crime data and the potential use of these data for negative purposes. Last but not least, discrimination towards certain community might be developed due to the findings of data analysis, which could lead to improper behaviours or over-reaction of surveillance.

One of the major issues with dataveillance is the removal of a human actors who are replaced by computer system that oversee data and construct a representation from it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The removal of human actors can allow for false representations to be created based on the data that has been collected and surveilled. This is largely due to the lack of logical reasoning present within data. Computer systems can only use the data they have, which is not necessarily an accurate depiction of individuals or their situations. Dataveillance is highly automated through computer systems which observe our interactions and activities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; High automated systems and technology eliminates human understanding of our activities.                            
[[File:Do Not Track.png|thumb]]

== Resistance  ==
With such an increase in data collection and surveillance many individuals are now attempting to reduce the concerns that have alongside it. [[Countersurveillance]] is perhaps the most significant concept focused on the tactics to prevent dataveillance. There are various tools associated with the concept that of countersurveillance that disrupt the effectiveness and possibilities of dataveillance.

[[Privacy-enhancing technologies]], otherwise known as PETs, have been utilized by individuals to reduce data collection and decrease the possibility for dataveillance.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Roger|year=2003|title=Dataveillance - 15 years on|url=|journal=Privacy Issues Forum|volume=28|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PETs, such as [[Adblock Plus|adblocker]], attempt to prevent other actors from collecting users data. In the case of adblock, the web browser extension is able to prevent the display of advertisements, which disrupts data collection about users online interactions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For businesses that may limit their opportunity to provide online users with tailored advertisements. 

Recently, the European Union demanded companies to indicate that their website uses cookies.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This law has become basic practice by many online services and companies, however, education on tracking tools with the general public differs and therefore can prevent the effectiveness of this sort of ruling.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, many companies are launching new PETs initiatives within their products. For example, Mozilla's [[Firefox Focus]] in pre-enabled with customizable privacy features, which allows for better online privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/download/internet-tools/firefox-focus-20-3331090/|title=Firefox Focus 2.0 - Internet Tools - Downloads|last=Peers|first=Nick|newspaper=PC Advisor|language=en-GB|access-date=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few of the tools featured in Firefox Focus are also mimicked by other web browsers such as Apple's [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]]. Some of the various tools featured with these web browsers are the capabilities to block ads and remove cookie data and history. Private browsing, otherwise known as Incognito for Google Chrome users, allows users to browse the web with having their history or cookies saved. These tools help to curve dataveillance by disrupting the collection and analysis of users' data. While several other web browsers may not pre-enable these PETs within their software users can download the same tools, like adblocker, through their browser's web store such as the [[Chrome Web Store|Google Chrome Web Store]]. Many of these extensions help enable better privacy tools. 

Social networks, such as [[Facebook]], have introduced new {{when|date=November 2017}} security measures to help users protect their online data. Users can block their posts and other information on their account other than their name and profile  picture. While this doesn't necessarily prevent data tracking these tools have helped to keep users data more private and less accessible for online criminals to exploit.

A '''dush-toh''', also spelled '''dush-too''', '''dush-tooh''', or '''dush-tuh''',  is a customary [[Caddo]] hair ornament worn by girls and women during dances, particularly the [[Turkey Dance]].&lt;ref name=class&gt;[http://www.caddonation-nsn.gov/history/Camp.html "Summer Youth Camp."] ''Caddo Nation: Heritage and Culture''. (retrieved 3 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Neighboring tribes, such as the Kickapoo and Delaware, have similar women's hair ornaments.

A dush-toh consists of an embellished, butterfly- or hourglass-shaped frame that is worn on the back of the head with ribbons that flow down the back, almost to the ground. They were made in the 19th and 20th centuries,&lt;ref name=spim&gt;Ellison 11&lt;/ref&gt; as well as into the present.

==Frame==
The top of butterfly-shaped frame is typically 4.25 inches wide and the bottom is usually 4-5/8 inches wide. The frame is 7.5 inches tall. The frame can be covered in black felt and edged with colored ribbons on both sides. Further embellishments include white [[seed bead]]s sewn along the edges and silver studs placed according to the individual's preference. A silver band runs around the narrowest point of the frame, which is tied to the hair.&lt;ref name=new42&gt;Newkumet and Meredith, 42&lt;/ref&gt; A wooden hairpin can also be used to hold the dush-toh in place. [[German silver]] spots can be attached to the frame and beaded rosettes may be used to decorate the center of the frame.&lt;ref name=spim/&gt;

==Ribbons==
[[File:Caddo turkey dance00.jpg|thumb|360px|[[Turkey Dance]], Caddo Tribal Complex, [[Binger, Oklahoma]], 2000. The dush-toh worn by the dancer on the far left is visible.]]
The ribbons, usually of [[watered silk]], are attached to the bottom of the headpiece. Four layers of ribbons are typically sewn to one ribbon band, which is sewn to the felt on the frame. Ribbons can be solid colors or plaid. They run down the back to the hemline of the dancer's dress. Bells, or ''cai'-coo-tze'', can be sewn to the bottom for weight and a musical sound. Ribbons can be embellished with shell, mirrors,&lt;ref name=new42/&gt; [[German silver]] medallions, or beadwork rosettes.&lt;ref name=spim/&gt;

==Classes==
The Caddo Nation offers classes in making dush-tohs to Caddo youth during their annual summer camp.&lt;ref name=class/&gt;

==Multimedia instructional design principles==

Beginning with [[Cognitive load|cognitive load theory]] as their motivating scientific premise, researchers such as [[Richard E. Mayer]], [[John Sweller]], and Roxana Moreno established within the scientific literature a set of multimedia instructional design principles that promote effective learning.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. E., &amp; Moreno, R., "Nine ways to reduce cognitive load in multimedia learning."

John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these principles have been "field tested" in everyday learning settings and found to be effective there as well.&lt;ref&gt;Harskamp, E. G., Mayer, R. E., &amp; Suhre, C., "Does the modality principle for multimedia learning apply to science classrooms?" Learning and Instruction, 17(5), 465-477, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C.

Y., Low, R., &amp; Sweller, J., "Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes," Journal of educational psychology, 87(2), 319, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerven, P.

G., "The efficiency of multimedia learning into old age," British Journal of Educational Psychology, 73(4), 489-505, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research using learners who have greater prior knowledge in the lesson material sometimes finds results that contradict these design principles. This has led some researchers to put forward the "expertise effect" as an instructional design principle unto itself.&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A. E., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merriënboer, J. J. G., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animations," Computers in Human Behavior, 27, 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merrienboer, J. J., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animated worked-out examples," Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blayney, P., Kalyuga, S., &amp; Sweller, J. "Interactions between the isolated–interactive elements effect and levels of learner expertise: Experimental evidence from an accountancy class," Instructional Science, 38(3), 277-287, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalyuga, S., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Incorporating learner experience into the design of multimedia instruction," Journal of Educational Psychology, 92, 126–136, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying theoretical premise, cognitive load theory, describes the amount of mental effort that is related to performing a task as falling into one of three categories: germane, intrinsic, and extraneous.&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, J (June 1988). "Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning". Cognitive Science 12 (2): 257–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Germane cognitive load is the mental effort required to process the task's information, make sense of it, and access and/or store it in long-term memory (for example, seeing a math problem, identifying the values and operations involved, and understanding that your task is to solve the math problem). Intrinsic cognitive load is the mental effort required to perform the task itself (for example, actually solving the math problem). Extraneous cognitive load is the mental effort imposed by the way that the task is delivered, which may or may not be efficient (for example, finding the math problem you are supposed to solve on a page that also contains advertisements for books about math).

The multimedia instructional design principles identified by Mayer, Sweller, Moreno, and their colleagues are largely focused on minimizing extraneous cognitive load and managing intrinsic and germane loads at levels that are appropriate for the learner. Examples of these principles in practice include 
* Reducing extraneous load by eliminating visual and auditory effects and elements that are not central to the lesson, such as [[seductive details]] (the coherence principle)&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Bove, W., Bryman, A., Mars, R., &amp; Tapangco, L., "When less is more: Meaningful learning from visual and verbal summaries of science textbook lessons." Journal of Educational Psychology, 88, 64–73, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harp, S.F., &amp; Mayer, R.E. "How seductive details do their damage: A theory of cognitive interest in science learning." Journal of Educational Psychology, 90, 414–434, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reducing germane load by delivering verbal information through audio presentation (narration) while delivering relevant visual information through static images or animations (the modality principle)&lt;ref&gt;Mousavi, S. Y., Low, R., &amp; Sweller, J., "Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes." Journal of educational psychology, 87(2), 319, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., &amp; Moreno, R., "A split-attention effect in multimedia learning: Evidence for dual coding hypothesis." Journal of Educational Psychology, 83, 484–490, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Controlling intrinsic load by breaking the lesson into smaller segments and giving learners control over the pace at which they move forward through the lesson material (the segmenting principle).&lt;ref name="Moreno, R. 2007"&gt;Moreno, R., "Optimizing learning from animations by minimizing cognitive load: Cognitive and affective consequences of signaling and segmentation methods." Applied Cognitive Psychology, 21, 765–781, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., van Gog, T., Wouters, P., &amp; van Merriënboer, J. J., "Explaining the segmentation effect in learning from animations: The role of pausing and temporal cueing." Computers &amp; Education, 59(2), 274-280, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florax, M., &amp; Ploetzner, R., "What contributes to the split-attention effect? Role of text segmentation, picture labeling, and spatial proximity." Learning and Instruction, 20, 216–224, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive load theory (and by extension many of the multimedia instructional design principles) is based in part on a model of [[working memory]] by [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch]] who proposed that working memory has two largely independent, limited capacity sub-components that tend to work in parallel – one visual and one verbal/acoustic.&lt;ref name="Baddeley" /&gt; This gave rise to [[dual-coding theory]], first proposed by [[Allan Paivio]] and later applied to multimedia learning by [[Richard E. Mayer|Richard Mayer]]. According to Mayer,&lt;ref name=Mayer2001 /&gt; separate channels of working memory process auditory and visual information during any lesson. Consequently, a learner can use more cognitive processing capacities to study materials that combine auditory verbal information with visual graphical information than to process materials that combine printed (visual) text with visual graphical information. In other words, the multi-modal materials reduce the cognitive load imposed on working memory.

In a series of studies, Mayer and his colleagues tested Paivio's [[dual-coding theory]], with multimedia lesson materials. They repeatedly found that students given multimedia with animation and narration consistently did better on transfer questions than those who learn from animation and text-based materials. That is, they were significantly better when it came to applying what they had learned after receiving multimedia rather than mono-media (visual only) instruction. These results were then later confirmed by other groups of researchers.

The initial studies of multimedia learning were limited to logical scientific processes that centered on cause-and-effect systems like automobile braking systems, how a bicycle pump works or cloud formation. However, subsequent investigations found that the [[modality effect]] extended to other areas of learning.

===Empirically established principles===
* '''Multimedia principle:''' Deeper learning is observed when words and relevant graphics are both presented than when words are presented alone (also called the multimedia effect).&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Ruth C.|last2=Mayer|first2=Richard E.|title=E-learning and the science of instruction: Proven guidelines for consumers and designers of multimedia learning.|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, the three most common elements in multimedia presentations are relevant graphics, audio narration, and explanatory text. Combining any two of these three elements works better than using just one or all three.
* '''Modality principle:'''  native speakers of the narration language, or when only printed words appear on the screen.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Generally speaking, audio narration leads to better learning than the same words presented as text on the screen. This is especially true for walking someone through graphics on the screen, and when the material to be learned is complex or the terminology being used is already understood by the student (otherwise see "pre-training"). One exception to this is when the learner will be using the information as a reference and will need to look back to it again and again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic principles for online and multimedia learning|url=http://www.edgurus.com/the-basics.html|website=www.edgurus.com|publisher=EdGurus.com|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Coherence principle:''' Avoid using unnecessary content (irrelevant video, graphics, music, stories, narration, etc.) in order to minimize cognitive load imposed on memory during learning by irrelevant and possibly distracting content.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Basically, the less learners know about the lesson content, the easier it is for them to get distracted by anything shown that is not directly relevant to the lesson. For learners with greater prior knowledge, however, some motivational imagery may increase their interest and learning effectiveness just a bit.&lt;ref&gt;Park, B., Moreno, R., Seufert, T., &amp; Brü., "Does cognitive load moderate the seductive details effect? A multimedia study." Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 5-10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magner, U. I., Schwonke, R., Aleven, V., Popescu, O., &amp; Renkl, A., "Triggering situational interest by decorative illustrations both fosters and hinders learning in computer-based learning environments." Learning and Instruction, 29, 141-152, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Contiguity principle:''' Keep related pieces of information together. Deeper learning occurs when relevant text (for example, a label) is placed close to graphics or when spoken words and graphics are presented at the same time, or when feedback is presented next to the answer given by the learner.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;
* '''Segmenting principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when content is broken into small chunks.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Break down long lessons into several shorter lessons.  Break down long text passages into multiple shorter ones.
* '''Signalling principle:''' The use of visual, auditory, or temporal cues to draw attention to critical elements of the lesson. Common techniques include arrows, circles, highlighting or bolding text, and pausing or vocal emphasis in narration.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crooks, S. M., Cheon, J., Inan, F., Ari, F., &amp; Flores, R. "Modality and cueing in multimedia learning: Examining cognitive and perceptual explanations for the modality effect." Computers in Human Behavior, 28(3), 1063-1071, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ending lesson segments after the critical information has been given may also serve as a signalling cue.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim, M., Antonenko, P. D., Greenwood, C. M., &amp; Wheeler, D. "Effects of segmenting, signalling, and weeding on learning from educational video." Learning, Media and Technology, 37(3), 220-235, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Learner control principle: ''' Deeper learning occurs when learners can control the rate at which they move forward through segmented content.&lt;ref name="Moreno, R. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasler, B. S., Kersten, B., &amp; Sweller, J., "Learner control, cognitive load and instructional animation." Applied cognitive psychology, 21(6), 713-729, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Savoji 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savoji|first1=A.P.|last2=Hassanabadi|first2=H.|last3=Fasihipour|first3=Z.|title=The modality effect in learner-paced multimedia learning.|journal=Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=2011|volume=30|pages=1488–1493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learners tend to do best when the narration stops after a short, meaningful segment of content is given and the learner has to click a "continue" button in order to start the next segment. Some research suggests not overwhelming the learner with too many control options, however. Giving just pause and play buttons may work better than giving pause, play, fast forward, reverse buttons.&lt;ref name="Savoji 2011" /&gt; Also, high prior-knowledge learners may learn better when the lesson moves forward automatically, but they have a pause button that allows them to stop when they choose to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Khacharem, A., Spanjers, I. A., Zoudji, B., Kalyuga, S., &amp; Ripoll, H., "Using segmentation to support the learning from animated soccer scenes: An effect of prior knowledge." Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 14(2), 154-160, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merrienboer, J. J., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animated worked-out examples." Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatsidimitris, G., &amp; Kalyuga, S., "Guided self-management of transient information in animations through pacing and sequencing strategies." Educational Technology Research and Development, 61(1), 91-105, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Personalization principle:''' Deeper learning in multimedia lessons occur when learners experience a stronger social presence, as when a conversational script or learning agents are used.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; The effect is best seen when the tone of voice is casual, informal, and in a 1st person ("I" or "we") or 2nd person ("you") voice.&lt;ref&gt;Kartal, G., "Does language matter in multimedia learning? Personalization principle revisited." Journal of Educational Psychology, 102(3), 615, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, of the following two sentences, the second version conveys more of a casual, informal, conversational tone: 
::A. The learner should have the sense that someone is talking directly to them when they hear the narration.
::B. Your learner should feel like someone is talking directly to them when they hear your narration.
:Also, research suggests that using a polite tone of voice ("You may want to try multiplying both sides of the equation by 10.") leads to deeper learning for low prior knowledge learners than does a less polite, more directive tone of voice ("Multiply both sides of the equation by 10."), but may impair deeper learning in high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, N., Johnson, W. L., Mayer, R. E., Rizzo, P., Shaw, E., &amp; Collins, H., "The politeness effect: Pedagogical agents and learning outcomes." International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 66(2), 98-112, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, B.M., DeLeeuw, K.E., &amp; Mayer, R.E. (2011). A politeness effect in learning with web-based intelligent tutors. International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 69, 70–79, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, adding pedagogical agents (computer characters) can help if used to reinforce important content. For example, have the character narrate the lesson, point out critical features in on-screen graphics, or visually demonstrate concepts to the learner.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Dow, G., &amp; Mayer, S., "Multimedia learning in an interactive self-explaining environment: What works in the design of agent-based microworlds?" Journal of Educational Psychology, 95, 806–813, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., Mayer, R.E., Spires, H., &amp; Lester, J., "The case for social agency in computer-based teaching: Do students learn more deeply when they interact with animated pedagogical agents?"

Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, and Applications, 22(2), 52-60, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Pre-training principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when lessons present key concepts or vocabulary prior to presenting the processes or procedures related to those concepts.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; According to Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzel,&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Mathias, A., &amp; Wetzell, K., "Fostering understanding of multimedia messages through pretraining: Evidence for a two-stage theory of mental model construction." Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 8, 147–154, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; "Before presenting a multimedia explanation, make sure learners visually recognize each major component, can name each component and can describe the major state changes of each component. In short, make sure learners build component models before presenting a cause-and-effect explanation of how a system works." However, others have noted that including pre-training content appears to be more important for low prior knowledge learners than for high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, E., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Assimilating complex information." Learning and Instruction, 12, 61–86, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, P., "Impact of reducing intrinsic cognitive load on learning in a mathematical domain." Applied Cognitive Psychology, 20(3), 287-298, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, T., Ayres, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "The impact of sequencing and prior knowledge on learning mathematics through spreadsheet applications." Educational Technology Research and Development, 53(3), 15-24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Redundancy principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when lesson graphics are explained by audio narration alone rather than audio narration and on-screen text.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; This effect is stronger when the lesson is fast-paced and the words are familiar to the learners. Exceptions to this principle include: screens with no visuals, learners who are not native speakers of the course language, and placement of only a few key words on the screen (i.e., labelling critical elements of the graphic image).&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., &amp; Mayer, R.E., "Verbal redundancy in multimedia learning: When reading helps listening." Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, 156–163, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheiter, K., Schüler, A., Gerjets, P., Huk, T., &amp; Hesse, F. W., "Extending multimedia research: How do prerequisite knowledge and reading comprehension affect learning from text and pictures." Computers in Human Behavior, 31, 73-84, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Cognitive load theory and the format of instruction." Cognition and Instruction, 8, 293-332, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Expertise effect:''' Instructional methods, such as those described above, that are helpful to domain novices or low prior knowledge learners may have no effect or may even depress learning in high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalyuga, S., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J. "Incorporating learner experience into the design of multimedia instruction." Journal of Educational Psychology, 92, 126–136, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, B.M., DeLeeuw, K.E., &amp; Mayer, R.E. "A politeness effect in learning with web-based intelligent tutors." International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 69, 70–79, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magner, U. I., Schwonke, R., Aleven, V., Popescu, O., &amp; Renkl, A. "Triggering situational interest by decorative illustrations both fosters and hinders learning in computer-based learning environments." Learning and Instruction, 29, 141-152, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such principles may not apply outside of laboratory conditions. For example, Muller found that adding approximately 50% additional extraneous but interesting material did not result in any significant difference in learner performance.&lt;ref name="Muller2008" /&gt; There is ongoing debate concerning the mechanisms underlying these beneficial principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tabbers, Martens, Merriënboer|title=The modality effect in multimedia instructions|url=http://ou.nl/Docs/Expertise/OTEC/Publicaties/huib%20tabbers/Cognitive%20Science%202001%20Huib%20Tabbers.pdf|publisher=[[Open University of the Netherlands]]|accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on what [[Boundary critique|boundary]] conditions may apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinwein|title=Does the Modality Effect Exist? and if So, Which Modality Effect?|journal=Journal of Psycholinguistic Research|year=2012|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w155x19117733217/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning theories==

{{Main article|Learning theory (education)}}

Good pedagogical practice has a theory of learning at its core. However, no single best-practice [[e-learning]] standard has emerged. This may be unlikely given the range of learning and teaching styles, the potential ways technology can be implemented and the ways in which [[educational technology]] itself is changing.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, S. and B. Newton (2003). "Models of eLearning: Technology Promise vs Learner Needs Literature Review." The International Journal of Management Education 3(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[pedagogical]] approaches or [[learning theories]] may be considered in designing and interacting with [[e-learning]] programs.

'''Social-[[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]]'''&amp;nbsp;– this pedagogy is particularly well afforded by the use of discussion forums, blogs, wiki and online collaborative activities. It is a collaborative approach that opens educational content creation to a wider group including the students themselves. The [[One Laptop Per Child|One Laptop Per Child Foundation]] attempted to use a constructivist approach in its project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Constructivism Wiki.Laptop.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurillard's conversational model'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rjr/dolweb/docs/laurillardmoddoc.htm Informal description of Laurillard's Model]&lt;/ref&gt; is also particularly relevant to eLearning, and [[Gilly Salmon]]'s Five-Stage Model is a pedagogical approach to the use of discussion boards.&lt;ref&gt;E-moderating: The Key to Teaching and Learning Online&amp;nbsp;– Gilly Salmon, Kogan Page, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7494-4085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive perspective''' focuses on the cognitive processes involved in learning as well as how the brain works.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. S., and D. R. Krathwohl. (1956). Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Handbook 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional perspective''' focuses on the emotional aspects of learning, like motivation, engagement, fun, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Bååth, J. A. (1982) "Distance Students' Learning&amp;nbsp;– Empirical Findings and Theoretical Deliberations"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Behavioural perspective''' focuses on the skills and behavioural outcomes of the learning process. Role-playing and application to on-the-job settings.&lt;ref&gt;Areskog, N-H. (1995) The Tutorial Process&amp;nbsp;– the Roles of Student Teacher and Tutor in a Long Term Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contextual perspective''' focuses on the environmental and social aspects which can stimulate learning. Interaction with other people, collaborative discovery and the importance of peer support as well as pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Black, J. &amp; McClintock, R. (1995) "An Interpretation Construction Approach to Constructivist Design."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mode neutral''' Convergence or promotion of ‘transmodal’ learning where online and classroom learners can coexist within one learning environment thus encouraging interconnectivity and the harnessing of collective intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Smith B, Reed P &amp; Jones C (2008)  ‘Mode Neutral’ pedagogy. European Journal of Open, Distance and E-learning."&lt;/ref&gt;

For many theorists, it’s the interaction between student and teacher and student and student in the online environment that enhances learning (Mayes and de Freitas 2004). Pask’s theory that learning occurs through conversations about a subject which in turn helps to make knowledge explicit has an obvious application to learning within a  [[Virtual learning environment|VLE]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen, I. E., J. Seaman, et al. (2007). Blending In: The Extent and Promise of Blended Education in the United States. Needham, M.A., The Sloan Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon developed a five-stage model of e-learning and e-moderating that for some time has had a major influence where online courses and online discussion forums have been used.&lt;ref name="Salmon2005"&gt;Salmon, G. (2005). E-moderating, the key to teaching and learning online. Routledge Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt; In her five-stage model, individual access and the ability of students to use the technology are the first steps to involvement and achievement. The second step involves students creating an identity online and finding others with whom to interact; online socialisation is a critical element of the e-learning process in this model. In step 3 students are giving and sharing information relevant to the course to each other. Collaborative interaction amongst students is central to step 4. The fifth step in Salmon’s model involves students looking for benefits from the system and using resources from outside of it to deepen their learning. Throughout all of this, the tutor/teacher/lecturer fulfils the role of moderator or e-moderator, acting as a facilitator of student learning.

Some criticism is now beginning to emerge. Her model does not easily transfer to other contexts (she developed it with experience from an Open University distance learning course). It ignores the variety of learning approaches that are possible within computer mediated communication (CMC) and the range of learning theories that are available (Moule 2007).

===Self-regulation===
[[Self-regulated learning]] refers to several concepts that play major roles in learning, and which have significant relevance in e-learning. Zimmerman (1998){{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!--recently added "citation" without adequate specifics; is this a reference that's being taken from the Peter Williams book, right below? --&gt; explains that in order to develop self-regulation, learning courses should offer opportunities for students to practice strategies and skills by themselves. Self-regulation is also strongly related to a student's social sources such as parents and teachers. Moreover, Steinberg (1996) found that high-achieving students usually have high-expectation parents who monitor their children closely.&lt;ref name="Williams2004"&gt;Peter E. Williams and Chan M. Hllman(Feb.,2004). Differences in self-regulation for online learning between first-and second-generation college students.''Research in Higher Education'', Vol. 45, No.1, pp. 71-82.https://www.jstor.org/stable/40197287&lt;/ref&gt;

With the academic environment, self-regulated learners usually set their academic goals and monitor and react themselves in process in order to achieve their goals. Schunk argues, "students must regulate not only their actions but also their underlying achievement-related cognitions, beliefs, intentions and effects"(p.&amp;nbsp;359). Moreover, academic self-regulation also helps students develop confidence in their ability to perform well in e-learning courses.&lt;ref name="Williams2004" /&gt;

=== Theoretical framework ===
E-learning literature identifies an ecology of concepts, from  a bibliometric study  were identified the most used concepts associated with the use of computers in learning contexts, e.g. computer assisted  instruction (CAI), computer assisted learning (CAL), computer-based education (CBE), e-learning, learning management systems (LMS), self-directed learning (SDL), and massive open online courses (MOOC). All these concepts have two aspects in common: learning and computers; except the SDL concept, which derives from psychology, and does not necessarily apply to computer usage. These concepts are yet to be studied in scientific research, and stand in contrast to MOOCs. Nowadays, e-learning can also mean massive distribution of content and global classes for all the Internet users. E-learning studies can be focused on three principal dimensions: users, technology, and services. According to Aparicio, Bacao &amp; Oliveira&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aparicio|first=M.|last2=Bacao|first2=F.|last3=Oliveira|first3=T.|date=|year=2016|title=An e-Learning Theoretical Framework|url=http://www.ifets.info/journals/19_1/24.pdf|journal=Educational Technology &amp; Society|publisher=IEEE|volume=19 |issue=1|pages=292–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''The e-learning systems' theoretical framework contains the three main components of information systems. These components are people, technologies, and services. People interact with e-learning systems. E-learning technologies enable the direct or indirect interaction of the different groups of users. Technologies provide support to integrate content, enable communication, and provide collaboration tools. E-learning services integrate all the activities corresponding to pedagogical models and to instructional strategies. The complex interaction combination is the direct or indirect action with e-learning systems. At the same time, systems provide services according to the specified strategies for activities. In other words, service specifications are e-learning activities aligned with the e-learning pedagogical models and the instructional strategies''".

==Teacher use of technology==

Computing technology was not created by teachers. There has been little consultation between those who promote its use in schools and those who teach with it. Decisions to purchase technology for education are very often political decisions. Most staff using these technologies did not grow up with them.&lt;ref&gt;Laurillard, D. (2006). Rethinking University Teaching: a framework for the effective use of learning technologies. Abingdon, Oxon., RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Training teachers to use computer technology did improve their confidence in its use, but there was considerable dissatisfaction with training content and style of delivery.&lt;ref name="Galanouli2004" /&gt; The communication element, in particular, was highlighted as the least satisfactory part of the training, by which many teachers meant the use of a VLE and discussion forums to deliver online training (Leask 2002). Technical support for online learning, lack of access to hardware, poor monitoring of teacher progress and a lack of support by online tutors were just some of the issues raised by the asynchronous online delivery of training (Davies 2004).

Newer generation [[web 2.0]] services provide customizable, inexpensive platforms for authoring and disseminating multimedia-rich e-learning courses, and do not need specialised [[information technology]] (IT) support.&lt;ref&gt;Tam CW, Eastwood A. Available, intuitive and free! Building e-learning modules using web 2.0 services.Med Teach. 2012;34(12):1078-80. {{DOI|10.3109/0142159X.2012.731105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''extinct language''' is a [[language]] that no longer has any speakers,&lt;ref&gt;Lenore A. Grenoble, Lindsay J. Whaley, ''Saving Languages: An Introduction to Language Revitalization'',  Cambridge University Press (2006) p.18&lt;/ref&gt; especially if the language has no living [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|descendants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/voices/yourvoice/language_ecology2.shtml|title=BBC - Voices - Your Voice|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a '''dead language''' is "one that is no longer the [[native language]] of any community", even if it is still in use, like [[Latin language|Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199202720.001.0001/acref-9780199202720-e-799?rskey=GN3YxZ&amp;result=801  ''The Comcise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics'' (2nd edition).&lt;/ref&gt; Languages that currently have living native speakers are sometimes called [[modern languages]] to contrast them with dead languages, especially in educational contexts.

In the [[modern period]], languages have typically become extinct as a result of the process of [[cultural assimilation]] leading to [[language shift]], and the gradual abandonment of a native language in favour of a foreign ''[[lingua franca]]'', largely those of [[European colonialism|European countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XxZbhSsqnUQC&amp;pg=PT739|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning|last=Byram|first=Michael|last2=Hu|first2=Adelheid|date=2013-06-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1136235535|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HecNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100|title=Living Through Languages: An African Tribute to René Dirven|last=Walt|first=Christa Van der|date=2007-05-01|publisher=AFRICAN SUN MeDIA|isbn=9781920109707|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sq5pdj2snokC&amp;pg=PA115|title=Mapping Applied Linguistics: A Guide for Students and Practitioners|last=Hall|first=Christopher J.|last2=Smith|first2=Patrick H.|last3=Wicaksono|first3=Rachel|date=2015-05-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1136836237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2000s, a total of roughly 7,000 natively spoken languages existed worldwide. Most of these are minor languages in danger of extinction; one estimate published in 2004 expected that some 90% of the currently spoken languages will have become extinct by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4387421/ |title=Study by language researcher, David Graddol |publisher=MSNBC |date=2004-02-26 |accessdate=2012-03-22}}

[[Ethnologue]] records 7,358 living languages known,{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/web.asp |title=Ethnologue |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011005193846/http://www.ethnologue.com/web.asp |archivedate=October 5, 2001 }}  but on 2015-05-20, [[Ethnologue]] reported only 7,102 known living languages; and on 2015-02-23, Ethnologue already reported only 7,097 known living languages.

==Language death==
{{main|Language death}}
[[File:Yuchilanguagespeakers.jpg|thumb|right|Sisters Maxine Wildcat Barnett (left) and Josephine Wildcat Bigler; two of the final surviving elderly speakers of [[Yuchi language|Yuchi]], visiting their grandmother's grave in a cemetery behind Pickett Chapel in [[Sapulpa]], [[Oklahoma]]. According to the sisters, their grandmother had insisted that Yuchi be their native language.]]
Normally the transition from a spoken to an extinct language occurs when a language undergoes [[language death]] by being directly replaced by a different one. For example, many [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] were replaced by [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as a result of [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization]].

In contrast to an extinct language, which no longer has any speakers, or any written use, a historical language may remain in use as a [[Literary language|literary]] or [[Liturgical language|liturgical]] language long after it ceases to be spoken natively. Such languages are sometimes also referred to as "dead languages", but more typically as [[classical language]]s. The most prominent Western example of such a language is [[Latin]], but comparable cases are found throughout world history due to the universal tendency to retain an historical stage of a language as [[liturgical language]].

Historical languages with living descendants that have undergone significant [[language change]] may be considered "extinct", especially in cases where they did not leave a [[text corpus|corpus]] of literature or liturgy that remained in widespread use (see [[corpus language]]), as is the case with e.g. [[Old English]] or [[Old High German]] relative to their contemporary descendants, [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]].

Some degree of misunderstanding can result from designating languages such as Old English and Old High German as extinct, or Latin dead, while ignoring their evolution as a language. This is expressed in the apparent paradox "Latin is a dead language, but Latin never died." A language such as [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], for example, can be said to be both extinct and dead: inscriptions are ill understood even by the most knowledgeable scholars, and the language ceased to be used in any form long ago, so that there have been no speakers, native or non-native, for many centuries. In contrast, Old English, Old High German and Latin never ceased evolving as living languages, nor did they become totally extinct as Etruscan did. Through time Latin underwent both common and divergent changes in phonology, morphology, syntax and lexicon and continues today as the native language of hundreds of millions of people, renamed as different Romance languages and dialects (French, Italian, Spanish, [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], etc.). Similarly, Old English and Old High German never died, but developed into various forms of modern English and German. With regard to the written language, skills in reading or writing Etruscan are all but non-existent, but trained people can understand and write Old English, Old High German and Latin. Latin differs from the Germanic counterparts in that an approximation of its ancient form is still employed to some extent liturgically. This last observation illustrates that for Latin, Old English, or Old High German to be described accurately as dead or extinct, the language in question must be conceptualized as frozen in time at a particular state of its history. This is accomplished by periodizing English and German as Old; for Latin, the most apt clarifying adjective is Classical, which also normally includes designation of high or formal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]].

Minor languages are endangered mostly due to economic and cultural [[globalization]] and development. 
With increasing economic integration on national and regional scales, people find it easier to communicate and conduct business in the dominant [[lingua franca]]s of world commerce: [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="Language and Linguistics: Endangered Language."&gt;{{cite web |last=Malone |first=Elizabeth |title=Language and Linguistics: Endangered Language |publisher= National Science Foundation |date=July 28, 2008 |accessdate= October 23, 2009 |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/linguistics/endangered.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their study of contact-induced language change, American linguists Sarah Grey Thomason and [[Terrence Kaufman]] (1991) stated that in situations of cultural pressure (where populations are forced to speak a dominant language), three linguistic outcomes may occur: first - and most commonly - a subordinate population may shift abruptly to the dominant language, leaving the native language to a sudden linguistic death. Second, the more gradual process of [[language death]] may occur over several generations. The third and most rare outcome is for the pressured group to maintain as much of its native language as possible, while borrowing elements of the dominant language's grammar (replacing all, or portions of, the grammar of the original language).&lt;ref&gt;Thomason, Sarah Grey &amp; Kaufman, Terrence. ''Language Contact, Creolization, and Genetic Linguistics'', University of California Press (1991) p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions such as the education system, as well as (often global) forms of media such as the Internet, television, and print media play a significant role in the process of language loss.&lt;ref name="Language and Linguistics: Endangered Language."/&gt; For example, when people migrate to a new country, their children attend school in the country, and the schools are likely to teach them in the majority language of the country rather than their parents' native language.

==Language revival==
{{main|Language revitalization}}
[[Language revival]] is the attempt to re-introduce a recently extinct language in everyday use by a new generation of native speakers. 
The  optimistic [[neologism]]  "[[sleeping beauty]] languages" has been used to express such a hope.&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 57 &amp; 60 in [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]]'s [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/new-vision.pdf A New Vision for "Israeli Hebrew": Theoretical and Practical Implications of Analysing Israel's Main Language as a Semi-Engineered Semito-European Hybrid Language], ''Journal of Modern Jewish Studies'' 5: 57–71 (2006).
[http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2014/september/1409493600/anna-goldsworthy/voices-land Dr Anna Goldsworthy on the Barngarla language reclamation], ''[[The Monthly]]'', September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is an example of a liturgical language that has successfully been [[Revival of the Hebrew language|revived]] for everyday use. The revival of Hebrew has been largely successful due to extraordinarily favourable conditions, notably the creation of a [[Israel|nation state]] in which it became the official language, as well as [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]]'s extreme dedication to the revival of the language, by creating new words for the modern terms Hebrew lacked. Revival attempts for minor languages with no status as liturgical language typically have more modest results. The [[Cornish language revival]] is an example of a major successful language revival: after a century of effort there are 3,500 claimed native speakers; enough for UNESCO to change its classification from "extinct" to  "critically endangered".

'''Saint Galgano''' (1148 &amp;ndash; December 3, 1181&lt;ref&gt;His alleged date of death is December 3, 1181, but other scholars assign it to November 30, 1180. The Roman Catholic Church celebrates Saint Galgano on November 30, as ordered in 2004 by Pope Johannes Paul II.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Catholic saint from [[Tuscany]] born in [[Chiusdino]], in the modern [[province of Siena]], [[Italy]]. His mother's name was Dionigia, while his father's name (Guido or Guidotto) only appeared in a document dated in the 16th century, when the last name Guidotti was attributed.

The [[canonization]] process to declare Galgano a saint started in 1185, only a few years after his death, and his canonization was the first conducted with a formal process by the Roman Church.&lt;ref&gt;As reported by A. Vauchez in "La santità nel medioevo", Il Mulino, Bologna, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of Saint Galgano's life is known through the documents of the canonization process in 1185&lt;ref&gt;''Inquisitio in partibus'', transcribed by Sigismondo Tizio in ''Historiae Senenses'' and transcribed in "Analecta Toscana IV; Der Einsiedler Galgano von chiusino und die Anfange von San Galgano" by Fedor Schneider (1914-1924).
&lt;/ref&gt; and other ''Vitae: Legenda beati Galgani''&lt;ref&gt;Codice Laurenziano, 14th century&lt;/ref&gt; by anonymous,  ''Legenda beati Galgani confessoris'' by an unknown Cistercian monk,&lt;ref&gt;Codice di Siena, 15th century&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leggenda di Sancto Galgano'',&lt;ref&gt;Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, cod. Chigi M. V. 118, 15th century.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vita sancti Galgani de Senis'',&lt;ref&gt;Codice di Veroli, 15th century.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vita beati Galgani''.&lt;ref&gt;Codice Laurenziano, 15th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Galgano is said to have led a ruthless life in his early years, but later abandoned it in favour of a pious hermitage in the place now known as Rotonda di Montesiepi. His mother, Dionigia, is believed to have reported that Galgano had two visions, both involving [[Archangel Michael]]: in the first vision the Archangel told Galgano that he was going to be protected by the Archangel himself. In the second vision, Galgano was following the Archangel and they arrived to the hill of Montesiepi where they met the [[twelve Apostles]] and the Creator himself. After the visions, it is said that Galgano's horse refused to obey his orders and led him on top Montesiepi where his vision happened. Convinced that this was a sign, Galgano decided to plant a cross. Since he had no way to make one of wood, he planted his sword in the ground. The sword is said to have immediately become one piece with the ground so that nobody could remove it. A story says that in one of the visions, he was told to renounce material things. He, stating that it would be as hard as splitting a rock, decided to make his point by attempting to plunge his sword into one. The story goes on saying that the "stone yielded like butter".&lt;ref&gt;Dhwty, [http://www.ancient-origins.net/artifacts-other-artifacts/legendary-sword-stone-san-galgano-002968]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:San Galgano Spada nella roccia.JPG|thumb|right|The sword in the stone at Montesiepi Chapel]]

A round church was built over the purported tomb, where pilgrims came in large numbers and miracles were claimed. In that year [[Cistercian]] monks took over Montesiepi at the request of Hugh, bishop of [[Volterra]], but most of Galgano's monks left, scattered over Tuscany, and became Augustinian hermits. By 1220 a large Cistercian monastery was built below Galgano's hermitage: they then claimed him as a Cistercian saint. His cult was lively in Siena and Volterra, where numerous representations survive. The ruins of his hermitage can still be seen, while his cloak is kept in the church of Santuccio at Siena.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Saints/David Hugh Farmer 1997 Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sword in the stone ==
The sword in the stone can be seen at the Rotonda at Montesiepi, near the ruins of the [[Abbey of San Galgano]]. The handle of a sword protrudes from the ground, and is said to be the sword of San Galgano. An analysis of the metal done in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/16/rorycarroll.theobserver|title=Tuscany's Excalibur is the real thing, say scientists|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=2001-09-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; by prof. Garlaschelli confirmed that the "composition of the metal and the style are compatible with the era of the legend". The analysis also confirmed that the upper piece and the invisible lower one are authentic and belong to one and the same artifact&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://rcin.org.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=54814|title=Fasciculi Archaeologiae Historicae.

A '''genus–differentia [[definition]]''' is a type of [[Extensional and intensional definitions#Intensional definition|intensional definition]], and it is composed of two parts:

# '''a [[Genus_(philosophy)|genus]]''' (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.
# '''the [[differentia]]''': The portion of the definition that is not provided by the genus.
For example, consider these two definitions:
* ''a [[triangle]]'': A plane figure that has 3 straight bounding sides.
* ''a [[quadrilateral]]'': A plane figure that has 4 straight bounding sides.
Those definitions can be expressed as one genus and two ''differentiae'':
# ''one genus'':
#* ''the genus for both a triangle and a quadrilateral'': "A plane figure"
# ''two differentiae'':
#* ''the differentia for a triangle'': "that has 3 straight bounding sides."
#* ''the differentia for a quadrilateral'': "that has 4 straight bounding sides."

== Differentiation and Abstraction ==

The process of producing new definitions by ''extending'' existing definitions is commonly known as '''differentiation''' (and also as '''derivation'''). The reverse process, by which just part of an existing definition is used itself as a new definition, is called '''[[abstraction]]'''; the new definition is called ''an&amp;nbsp;abstraction'' and it is said to have been ''abstracted away from'' the existing definition.

For instance, consider the following:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles, and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.
A part of that definition may be singled out (using parentheses here):
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': (&lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles&lt;/span&gt;), and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.
and with that part, an abstraction may be formed:
* &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;''a [[rectangle]]'': a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles.&lt;/span&gt;
Then, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; that has bounding sides which all have the same length.

Similarly, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be rearranged and another portion singled out:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': (&lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length&lt;/span&gt;), and that has interior angles which are all right angles.
leading to the following abstraction:
* &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;''a [[rhombus]]'': a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length.&lt;/span&gt;
Then, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:
* ''a [[square (geometry)|square]]'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; that has interior angles which are all right angles.

In fact, the definition of ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' may be recast in terms of both of the abstractions, where one acts as the genus and the other acts as the differentia:
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; that is &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt;.
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; that is &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt;.
Hence, abstraction is crucial in simplifying definitions.

== Multiplicity ==

When multiple definitions could serve equally well, then all such definitions apply simultaneously. Thus, ''a&amp;nbsp;square'' is a member of both the genus ''&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; rectangle&lt;/span&gt;'' and the genus ''&lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; rhombus&lt;/span&gt;''. In such a case, it is notationally convenient to consolidate the definitions into one definition that is expressed with multiple genera (and possibly no differentia, as in the following):
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt;.
or completely equivalently:
* ''a square'': &lt;span style="background:LightBlue"&gt;a rhombus&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="background:LightSalmon"&gt;a rectangle&lt;/span&gt;.

More generally, a collection of &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; equivalent definitions (each of which is expressed with one unique genus) can be recast as one definition that is expressed with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; genera. Thus, the following:
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* &amp;hellip;
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and that is a&amp;hellip; and that is a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.
could be recast as:
* ''a Definition'': a Genus&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a&amp;hellip; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; and a Genus&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, which has some non-genus Differentia.

== Structure ==

A genus of a definition provides a means by which to specify an ''[[is-a|is-a relationship]]'':
* A square is a rectangle, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a rhombus, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a plane figure, which is a&amp;hellip;
* A square is a&amp;hellip;
The non-genus portion of the differentia of a definition provides a means by which to specify a ''[[has-a|has-a relationship]]'':
* A square has an interior angle that is a right angle.
* A square has a straight bounding side.
* A square has a&amp;hellip;

When a system of definitions is constructed with genera and differentiae, the definitions can be thought of as nodes forming a [[hierarchy]] or—more generally—a [[directed acyclic graph]]; a node that has no [[Directed graph|predecessor]] is ''a&amp;nbsp;most general definition''; each node along a directed path is ''more '''differentiated''''' (or ''more '''derived''''') than any one of its predecessors, and a node with no [[Directed graph|successor]] is ''a&amp;nbsp;most differentiated'' (or ''a&amp;nbsp;most derived'') definition.

When a definition, ''S'', is the [[Directed graph|tail]] of each of its successors (that is, ''S'' has at least one successor and each [[Directed graph|direct successor]] of ''S'' is a most differentiated definition), then ''S'' is often called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''the '''[[species]]'''''&lt;/span&gt; of each of its successors, and each direct successor of ''S'' is often called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''an '''[[individual]]'''''&lt;/span&gt; (or &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''an '''[[entity]]'''''&lt;/span&gt;) of the species ''S''; that is, the genus of an individual is synonymously called ''the&amp;nbsp;species'' of that individual. Furthermore, the differentia of an individual is synonymously called &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap"&gt;''the [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]''&lt;/span&gt; of that individual. For instance, consider the following definition:
* ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'': a human that has the name 'John&amp;nbsp;Smith'.
In this case:
* The whole definition is ''an&amp;nbsp;individual''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is an individual.
* The genus of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' (which is "a&amp;nbsp;human") may be called synonymously ''the&amp;nbsp;species'' of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is an individual of the species ''&amp;#91;a&amp;#93; human''.
* The differentia of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' (which is "that has the name 'John&amp;nbsp;Smith'") may be called synonymously ''the&amp;nbsp;identity'' of ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith''; that is, ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is identified among other individuals of the same species by the fact that ''&amp;#91;the&amp;#93; John Smith'' is the one "that has the name 'John Smith'".

As in that example, the identity itself (or some part of it) is often used to refer to the entire individual, a phenomenon that is known in [[linguistics]] as a ''[[pars pro toto|pars&amp;nbsp;pro&amp;nbsp;toto]] [[synecdoche]]''.

A '''glass-bottom boat''' is a boat with one or more sections of glass, or other suitable [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] material, below the waterline allowing passengers to observe the underwater environment from within the boat. When a boat is a glass bottom, the view through is better than simply looking into the water from above, because one does not have to look through [[optics|optically]] erratic surface disturbances. The effect is similar to that achieved by a [[diving mask]], while the passengers are able to stay dry, out of the water.

== Use ==
Glass bottom boats are used almost exclusively for giving tours, as they are usually designed to allow the maximum number of [[tourist]]s to view out the [[glass floor|glass bottom]] and are not really suitable for other uses. 
Glass bottom boats are in use in nearly every seaside tourist destination. However many of them are gradually being replaced by [[semi submarine]]s, which offer a better view of the marine life.

== History ==
Glass bottom boats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toursmiamitokeywest.baihebu.com |title=Glass-bottom boat |first=Tyler|last=Bullock |date=September 5, 2011 |work=Silver Springs State Park |location=United States |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}{{dead|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were first used near [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]] off the coast of [[Southern California]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} They also became popular in Florida at several areas of natural springs that became tourist attractions, for example, [[Silver Springs Nature Theme Park|Silver Springs]], [[Wakulla Springs]], [[Rainbow Springs]], and [[Weeki Wachee Springs]].  The oldest glass bottom boat ('Princess Donna' 1934) from Silver Springs is still operating on the Homosassa River in Florida.   

The most modern glass bottom boats have ultra-durable bottom window shaped as an optically regular [[spheroid]] which size is 2x3 m. These boats also have a [[hydrofoil]]. This is a contemporary product of Russian boatbuilding company - Paritetboat [1].    

Typical tours in these boats include views of underwater flora and fauna, [[reef]]s, [[shipwrecks]], and other underwater sights.

The '''history of money''' concerns the development of social systems that provide at least one of the [[money#Functions|functions of money]]. Such systems can be understood as means of trading wealth indirectly; not directly as with [[barter]]. [[Money]] is a mechanism that facilitates this process.

Money may take a physical form as in coins and notes, or may exist as a written or electronic account. It may have [[Intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]] ([[commodity money]]), be legally exchangeable for something with intrinsic value ([[representative money]]), or only have nominal value ([[fiat money]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-money/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The significant evidence establishes many things were bartered in ancient markets that could be described as a [[medium of exchange]]. These included livestock and grain – things directly useful in themselves – but also merely attractive items such as [[cowry|cowrie shells]] or [[bead]]s were exchanged for more useful [[commodities]]. However, such exchanges would be better described as [[barter system|barter]], and the common bartering of a particular commodity (especially when the commodity items are not fungible) does not technically make that commodity "[[money]]" or a "[[commodity money]]" like the [[shekel]] – which was both a coin representing a specific weight of [[barley]], and the weight of that sack of barley.&lt;ref name="Kramer, pp. 52"&gt;Kramer, ''History Begins at Sumer'', pp. 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the complexities of ancient history (ancient civilizations developing at different paces and not keeping accurate records or having their records destroyed), and because the ancient origins of economic systems precede written history, it is impossible to trace the true origin of the invention of money and the transition from "[[barter system]]s" to the "[[monetary system]]s". Further, evidence in the histories&lt;ref name="yale2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hammint.htm |title=The Code of Hammurabi : Introduction |accessdate=14 September 2007 |publisher=Yale University |year=1915 |author=Charles F. Horne |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908205713/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hammint.htm |archivedate=8 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; supports the idea that money has taken two main forms divided into the broad categories of ''[[unit of account|money of account]]'' (debits and credits on ledgers) and ''[[medium of exchange|money of exchange]]'' (tangible media of exchange made from wood, paper, bamboo, metal, etc.), and it is debated which was created first.

Regarding ''money of account'', the [[tally stick]] can reasonably be described as a very primitive ledger – the oldest of which dates to the Aurignacian, about 30,000 years ago. While it may not be reasonable to conclude the most ancient tally sticks were used to keep ''accounting records'' in the ''[[monetary system]]'' sense of the term, their existence does show that "accounting" – keeping a written record of things counted – is far more ancient than many people assume. [[David Graeber]] proposes that money as a unit of account was invented when the unquantifiable obligation "I owe you one" transformed into the quantifiable notion of "I owe you one unit of something". In this view, money emerged first as credit and only later took the form of a ''medium of exchange''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|first=David |last=Graeber|title= Debt: The First 5,000 Years|ISBN=1-933633-86-7|date=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nakedcapitalism.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Graeber|title= What is Debt? – An Interview with Economic Anthropologist David Graeber|date=26 August 2011|url=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/08/what-is-debt-%E2%80%93-an-interview-with-economic-anthropologist-david-graeber.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding ''money of exchange'', the use of [[representative money]] historically pre-dates the invention of [[coin]]age. In the ancient empires of Egypt, Babylon, India and China, the temples and palaces often had commodity warehouses which issued certificates of deposit as evidence of a claim upon a portion of the goods stored in the warehouses.&lt;ref name="mundell"&gt;Robert A. Mundell, [http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:114139/CONTENT/econ_0102_08.pdf The Birth of Coinage], Discussion Paper #:0102-08, Department of Economics, [[Columbia University]], February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Because these "claim tickets" could be redeemed at the warehouse for the commodity they represented, they were able to be bartered in the markets as if they were the commodity.

While not the oldest form of ''money of exchange'', various metals (both common and [[precious metals]]) were also used in both [[barter system]]s and [[monetary system]]s and the historical use of metals provides some of the clearest illustration of how the [[barter system]]s gave birth to [[monetary system]]s. The [[Roman Republican currency|Romans' use of bronze]], while not among the more ancient examples is well documented, and it illustrates this transition clearly. First, the "[[aes rude]]" (rough bronze) was used. This was a heavy weight of unmeasured bronze used in what was properly a barter system—the barter-ability of the bronze was related exclusively to its usefulness in blacksmithing and it was bartered with the intent of being turned into tools. The next historical step was bronze in bars that had a 5-pound pre-measured weight (presumably to make barter easier and more fair), called "[[aes signatum]]" (signed bronze), which is where debate arises between if this is still the [[barter system]] or now a [[monetary system]]. Finally, there is a clear break from the use of bronze in barter into its undebatable use as money because of lighter measures of bronze not intended to be used as anything other than coinage for transactions. The [[aes grave]] (heavy bronze) (or [[As (coin)|''As'']]) is the start of the use of coins in Rome, but not the oldest known example metal coinage.

===Theories of money===
{{main|Monetary economics}}
The invention of money took place before the beginning of written history.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, J.M. (1930). ''A Treatise on Money''. Volume I, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently any story of how money first developed is largely based on conjecture and logical inference. The earliest ideas included [[Aristotle]]'s "metallist" and [[Plato]]'s "cartalist" concepts, which [[Joseph Schumpeter]] integrated into his own theory of money as forms of classification.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marx’s Theory of Money: Modern Appraisals|last=Moseley|first=F|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2004|isbn=9781403936417|location=New York|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the Austrian economist attempted to develop a catallactic theory of money out of Claim Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Theory of Money and Credit|last=von Mises|first=Ludwig|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781620871614|location=New York|pages=472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schumpeter's theory had several themes but the most important of these involve the notions that money can be analyzed from the viewpoint of [[social accounting]] and that it is also firmly connected to the [[Theory of value (economics)|theory of value]] and price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Joseph A. Schumpeter: His Life and Work|last=Swedberg|first=Richard|publisher=Polity Press|year=2007|isbn=9780745668703|location=Malden, MA|pages=1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are at least two theories of what money ''is'' and these can influence the interpretation of historical and archeological evidence of early monetary systems. The [[commodity money|commodity theory of money]] (''money of exchange'') is preferred by those who wish to view money as a natural outgrowth of market activity.&lt;ref&gt;Tymoigne, Éric &amp; Wray, L. Randall (2005), [http://www.cfeps.org/pubs/wp-pdf/WP45-Tymoigne-Wray.pdf ''Money: An Alternative Story''], p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Others view the [[credit theory of money]] (''money of account'') as more plausible and may posit a key role for the state in establishing money. The Commodity theory is more widely held and much of this article is written from that point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Wray, L. Randall (2012), [http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_717.pdf ''Introduction to an Alternative History of Money''], p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the different theories of money developed by economists largely focus on functions, use, and management of money.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Prehistory: predecessors of money and its emergence==

===Non-monetary exchange===
====Barter====
{{Main|Bartering}}

In ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' Book 1:9&lt;ref&gt;S Meikle [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4182455 "Aristotle on Money"] [[Phronesis]] Vol. 39, No. 1 (1994), pp. 26–44 Retrieved 2012-06-05&lt;/ref&gt; ({{circa|350&amp;nbsp;[[Common Era|BCE]]}}) the Greek philosopher Aristotle contemplated the nature of money. He considered that every object has two uses: the original purpose for which the object was designed, and as an item to sell or barter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]] [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.1.one.html Politics] Translated by Benjamin Jowett MIT University&lt;/ref&gt; The assignment of monetary value to an otherwise insignificant object such as a coin or [[promissory note]] arises as people acquired a psychological capacity to place trust in each other and in external authority within barter exchange.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|author=N. K. Lewis|title=Gold: The Once and Future Money |url=https://books.google.com/?id=m82jozV3Qw4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+gold#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20gold&amp;f=false|accessdate=2012-06-04|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, 4 May 2007|isbn=0470047666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ggggggy"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David Kinley|D Kinley]]|title=Money: A Study of the Theory of the Medium of Exchange|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cbI62wAQhJ0C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Theory+of+evolution+of+money#v=onepage&amp;q=Theory%20of%20evolution%20of%20money&amp;f=false |accessdate=2012-06-04| year=2001|publisher=Simon Publications LLC, 1 September 2003 |isbn=193251211X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[barter]], an individual possessing any surplus of value, such as a measure of grain or a quantity of livestock, could directly exchange it for something perceived to have similar or greater value or [[utility]], such as a clay pot or a tool. The capacity to carry out barter transactions is limited in that it depends on a [[coincidence of wants]]. The seller of food grain has to find the buyer who wants to buy grain and who also could offer in return something the seller wants to buy. There is no agreed standard measure into which both seller and buyer could exchange commodities according to their relative value of all the various goods and services offered by other potential barter partners.

There is no evidence, historic or contemporary, of a society in which barter is the main mode of exchange.&lt;ref name="Humphrey, Caroline 1985"&gt;Humphrey, Caroline. 1985. "Barter and Economic Disintegration". Man, New Series 20 (1): 48–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms====
In his book ''[[Debt: The First 5,000 Years]]'', anthropologist [[David Graeber]] argues against the suggestion that money was invented to replace [[barter]]. The problem with this version of history, he suggests, is the lack of any supporting evidence. His research indicates that "gift economies" were common, at least at the beginnings of the [[History of agriculture|first agrarian]] societies, when humans used elaborate credit systems. Graeber proposes that money as a unit of account was invented the moment when the unquantifiable obligation "I owe you one" transformed into the quantifiable notion of "I owe you one unit of something". In this view, money emerged first as credit and only later acquired the functions of a medium of exchange and a store of value.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nakedcapitalism.com"/&gt; Graeber's criticism partly relies on and follows that made by Michell A. Innes in his 1913 pamphlet "What is money?". Innes refutes the barter theory of money, by examining historic evidence and showing that early coins never were of consistent value nor of more or less consistent metal content. Therefore he concludes that sales is not exchange of goods for some universal commodity, but an exchange for credit. He argues that "credit and credit alone is money".&lt;ref&gt;Innes, Michell A. 1913. "What is Money ?". The Banking Law Journal (May): 377–408.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Caroline Humphrey examines the available ethnographic data and concludes that "No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of money; all available ethnography suggests that there never has been such a thing".&lt;ref name="Humphrey, Caroline 1985"/&gt;

====Gift economy====
In a [[gift economy]], valuable [[goods and services]] are regularly given without any explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards (i.e. there is no formal ''[[quid pro quo]]'').&lt;ref name="Cheal "&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheal |first=David J |title=The Gift Economy |publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=1988|pages=1–19|chapter=1|isbn=0-415-00641-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-wNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, simultaneous or recurring giving serves to circulate and redistribute valuables within the community.

There are various [[Social theory|social theories]] concerning gift economies. Some consider the gifts to be a form of [[reciprocal altruism]]. Another interpretation is that implicit "[[IOU|I owe you]]" debt&lt;ref name="GraeberInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/08/what-is-debt-%E2%80%93-an-interview-with-economic-anthropologist-david-graeber.html|title=What is Debt? – An Interview with Economic Anthropologist David Graeber|publisher=[[Naked Capitalism]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social status are awarded in return for the "gifts".&lt;ref name="Pinchot, Gifford, The Gift Economy"&gt;[http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC41/PinchotG.htm Gifford Pinchot – The Gift Economy]. Context.org (2000-06-29). Retrieved on 2011-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Consider for example, the [[sharing]] of food in some [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, where food-sharing is a safeguard against the failure of any individual's daily foraging. This custom may reflect [[altruism]], it may be a form of informal insurance, or may bring with it social status or other benefits.

===Emergence of money===
After the domestication of cattle and the start of cultivation of crops in 9000–6000&amp;nbsp;BCE, livestock and plant products were used as money.&lt;ref name = davieschrono&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Davies &amp; Glyn Davies|title=A Comparative Chronology of Money|url=http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/RDavies/arian/amser/chrono1.html|date=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest instances of trade with money, the things with the greatest utility and reliability in terms of re-use and re-trading (their marketability), determined the nature of the objects chosen to exchange. So as in agricultural societies, things needed for efficient and comfortable employment of energies for the production of cereals and the like were the easiest to transfer to monetary significance for direct exchange. As more of the basic conditions of human existence were met,&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Maslow]], [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] in Richard Gross – Psychology: The Science of Mind and Behaviour {{ISBN|144410831X}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the division of labour increased to create new activities for the use of time{{clarify|date=January 2018}} to address more advanced concerns. As people's needs became more refined, indirect exchange became more likely, as the physical separation of skilled labourers (suppliers) from their prospective clients (demand) required the use of a medium common to all communities, to facilitate a wider market.&lt;ref name="Von Mises"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludwig Von Mises|title=The Theory of Money and Credit |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hHnIHlCm_CcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate= 2012-10-06|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2009|isbn=1933550554|year=1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.Marx, F.Engels ''The Communist Manifesto'' {{ISBN|1406851744}} Retrieved 2012-06-04&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's opinion of the creation of money as a new thing in society is:&lt;ref name="ggggggy"/&gt;

Many cultures around the world developed the use of [[commodity money]], that is, objects that have value in themselves as well as value in their use as money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Mesopotamia]]n civilization developed a large-scale economy based on commodity money.

The [[Code of Hammurabi]], the best-preserved ancient [[law code]], was created c.&amp;nbsp;1760&amp;nbsp;BCE ([[middle chronology]]) in ancient [[Babylon]]. It was enacted by the sixth Babylonian king, [[Hammurabi]]. Earlier collections of laws include the [[code of Ur-Nammu]], king of [[Ur]] (c. 2050&amp;nbsp;BCE), the [[Code of Eshnunna]] (c. 1930&amp;nbsp;BCE) and the code of [[Lipit-Ishtar]] of [[Isin]] (c. 1870&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref name="yale2"/&gt; These law codes formalized the role of money in [[civil society]].

From about 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE, money in the form of [[Ancient Chinese coinage|small knives and spades made of bronze]] was in use in China during the [[Zhou dynasty]], with cast bronze replicas of cowrie shells in use before this. The first manufactured actual coins seem to have appeared separately in India, China, and the cities around the [[Aegean Sea]] between 700 and 500&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="Graeber"&gt;David Graeber: Debt: The First 5000 Years, Melville 2011.

The different forms and metallurgical processes imply a separate development. All modern coins, in turn, are descended from the coins that appear to have been invented in the kingdom of Lydia in Asia Minor somewhere around the year 600 BCE and that spread throughout Greece in the following centuries: disk-shaped, made of gold, silver, bronze or imitations thereof, with both sides bearing an image produced by stamping; one side is often a human head.&lt;ref name="schaps"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schaps |first1=David M. |title=The Invention of Coinage in Lydia, in India, and in China |journal=XIV International Economic History Congress, Helsinki 2006 |volume=Session 30 |url=http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers1/Schaps.pdf |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other coins made of electrum (a naturally occurring alloy of silver and gold) were manufactured on a larger scale about 650&amp;nbsp;BCE in [[Lydia]] (on the coast of what is now Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rg.ancients.info/lion/article.html Goldsborough, Reid. "World's First Coin"]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar coinage was adopted and manufactured to their own standards in nearby cities of [[Ionia]], including [[Mytilene]] and [[Phokaia]] (using coins of [[electrum]]) and [[Aegina]] (using silver) during the 6th century BCE, and soon became adopted in mainland Greece, and the Persian Empire (after it incorporated Lydia in 547&amp;nbsp;BCE).

The use and export of [[silver coin]]age, along with soldiers paid in coins, contributed to the [[Athenian Empire]]'s dominance of the region in the 5th century BCE. The silver used was mined in southern [[Attica]] at [[Laurium]] and Thorikos by a huge workforce of slave labour. A major silver vein discovery at Laurium in 483&amp;nbsp;BCE led to the huge expansion of the Athenian military fleet.

====Assaying====
[[Assaying]] is analysis of the chemical composition of metals. The discovery of the [[Touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]]{{When|date=September 2018}} for assaying helped the popularisation of metal-based commodity money and coinage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Any soft metal, such as gold, can be tested for purity on a touchstone. As a result, the use of gold for as commodity money spread from [[Asia Minor]], where it first gained wide usage.{{dubious|date=January 2018}}

A touchstone allows the amount of gold in a sample of an [[alloy]] to been estimated. In turn this allows the alloy's purity to be estimated. This allows [[coin]]s with a uniform amount of gold to be created. Coins were typically [[mint (coin)|minted]] by governments and then stamped with an emblem that guaranteed the weight and value of the metal. However, as well as [[intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]] coins had a [[face value]]. Sometimes governments would reduce the amount of precious metal in a coin (reducing the intrinsic value) and assert the same face value, this practice is known as [[debasement]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====General notes====
{{Fix|text=This is not pre 400 AD}}

Gold and silver have been the most common forms of money throughout history. In many languages, such as Spanish, French, and Italian, the word for silver is still directly related to the word for money. Sometimes other metals were used. For instance, Ancient [[Sparta]] minted coins from iron to discourage its citizens from engaging in foreign trade.&lt;ref&gt;http://hsc.csu.edu.au/ancient_history/societies/greece/spartan_society/sparta_social/ancient_sparta_socialsystem.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 17th century Sweden lacked precious metals, and so produced "[[Swedish riksdaler|plate money]]": large slabs of copper 50&amp;nbsp;cm or more in length and width, stamped with indications of their value.

Gold coins began to be minted again in Europe in the 13th century. Frederick II is credited with having reintroduced gold coins during the [[Crusades]]. During the 14th century Europe changed from use of silver in currency to minting of gold.&lt;ref name= "Postan &amp; Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[William Arthur Shaw]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cHRvtwTLcMAC&amp;pg=PA832&amp;dq=History+of+gold+coins#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20gold%20coins&amp;f=false|title=The History of Currency, 1252–1896|publisher=Library of Alexandria, 1967|isbn=1465518878|accessdate=2012-06-04 |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vienna made this change in 1328.&lt;ref name="Postan &amp; Miller"&gt;{{cite book |author=M M Postan, E Miller |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wSia_4PpeqQC&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=Philip+IV+first+gold+coinage#v=onepage&amp;q=Philip%20IV%20first%20gold%20coinage&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge Economic History of Europe: Trade and industry in the Middle Ages|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 28 August 1987|isbn=0521087090 |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal-based coins had the advantage of carrying their value within the coins themselves – on the other hand, they induced manipulations, such as the clipping of coins to remove some of the precious metal. A greater problem was the simultaneous co-existence of gold, silver and copper coins in Europe. The exchange rates between the metals varied with supply and demand. For instance the gold guinea coin began to rise against the silver crown in England in the 1670s and 1680s. Consequently, silver was exported from England in exchange for gold imports. The effect was worsened with Asian traders not sharing the European appreciation of gold altogether — gold left Asia and silver left Europe in quantities European observers like [[Isaac Newton]], Master of the Royal Mint observed with unease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1701-25-mint-reports/report-1717-09-25.html |title=Sir Isaac Newton's state of the gold and silver coin (25 September 1717). |publisher=[[Pierre Marteau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stability came when national banks guaranteed to change silver money into gold at a fixed rate; it did, however, not come easily. The Bank of England risked a national financial catastrophe in the 1730s when customers demanded their money be changed into gold in a moment of crisis. Eventually London's merchants saved the bank and the nation with financial guarantees.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Another step in the evolution of money was the change from a coin being a unit of weight to being a unit of value. A distinction could be made between its commodity value and its ''specie'' value. The difference in these values is [[seigniorage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2002/of02-303/OFR_02-303.pdf |format=PDF|title=Mineral Profiles |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} &lt;!-- not in the source --&gt;

===Banknotes===
{{Main|Banknote}}
[[File:圖7-70 最早出現的紙幣──交子印樣.jpg|thumbnail|right|Earliest banknote from China during the Song Dynasty which is known as "Jiaozi"]]
Paper money was introduced in [[Song Dynasty]] China during the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Headrick"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel R. Headrick|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988759-0|pages=85– |title=Technology: A World History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the banknote began in the seventh century, with local issues of paper currency. Its roots were in merchant [[receipt]]s of deposit during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), as [[Four occupations#The shang (商)|merchants]] and wholesalers desired to avoid the heavy bulk of [[Chinese coins|copper coinage]] in large commercial transactions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Ebrey, Walthall, and Palais (2006), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;Bowman (2000), 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gernet 1962 80"&gt;Gernet (1962), 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of credit notes is often for a limited duration, and at some discount to the promised amount later. The jiaozi nevertheless did not replace coins during the Song Dynasty; paper money was used alongside the coins. The central government soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right of several of the deposit shops to the issuance of these certificates of deposit.&lt;ref name="ebrey 156"&gt;Ebrey et al., 156.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 12th century, the amount of banknotes issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26 million strings of cash coins.&lt;ref name="gernet 80"&gt;Gernet, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, paper money became known in Europe through the accounts of travelers, such as [[Marco Polo]] and [[William of Rubruck]]&lt;!-- Giljom de Rubruk --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moshenskyi|first=Sergii|title=History of the weksel: Bill of exchange and promissory note|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4363-0694-2|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Polo's account of paper money during the [[Yuan Dynasty]] is the subject of a chapter of his book, ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'', titled "[[Wikisource:The Travels of Marco Polo/Book 2/Chapter 24|How the Great Kaan Causeth the Bark of Trees, Made into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All Over his Country]]."&lt;ref name="Marco Polo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marco Polo|title=The Travels of Marco Polo, a Venetian, in the Thirteenth Century: Being a Description, by that Early Traveller, of Remarkable Places and Things, in the Eastern Parts of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JetQAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA353|accessdate=19 September 2012|year=1818|pages=353–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Italy]] and [[Count of Flanders|Flanders]], because of the insecurity and impracticality of transporting large sums of money over long distances, money traders started using [[promissory note]]s. In the beginning these were personally registered, but they soon became a written order to pay the amount to whomever had it in their possession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YermphJSixkC&amp;pg=PT22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Alchemists: Three Central Bankers and a World on Fire - Neil Irwin - Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; These notes can be seen as a predecessor to regular banknotes.&lt;ref&gt;De Geschiedenis van het Geld (the History of Money), 1992, Teleac, page 96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade bills of exchange===
Bills of exchange became prevalent with the expansion of European trade toward the end of the Middle Ages. A flourishing Italian wholesale trade in cloth, woolen clothing, wine, tin and other commodities was heavily dependent on credit for its rapid expansion. Goods were supplied to a buyer against a bill of exchange, which constituted the buyer's promise to make payment at some specified future date. Provided that the buyer was reputable or the bill was endorsed by a credible guarantor, the seller could then present the bill to a merchant banker and redeem it in money at a discounted value before it actually became due. The main purpose of these bills nevertheless was, that traveling with cash was particularly dangerous at the time. A deposit could be made with a banker in one town, in turn a bill of exchange was handed out, that could be redeemed in another town.

These bills could also be used as a form of payment by the seller to make additional purchases from his own suppliers. Thus, the bills – an early form of credit – became both a medium of exchange and a medium for storage of value. Like the loans made by the Egyptian grain banks, this trade credit became a significant source for the creation of new money. In England, bills of exchange became an important form of credit and money during last quarter of the 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th century before banknotes, checks and cash credit lines were widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Glyn, [http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/RDavies/arian/llyfr.html ‘’A History of Money’’], University of Wales, 1994, p. 172, 339. {{ISBN|0-7083-1717-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tallies===
The acceptance of symbolic forms of money meant that a symbol could be used to represent something of value that was available in physical storage somewhere else in space, such as grain in the warehouse; or something of value that would be available later, such as a promissory note or [[bill of exchange]], a document ordering someone to pay a certain sum of money to another on a specific date or when certain conditions have been fulfilled.

In the 12th century, the English monarchy introduced an early version of the bill of exchange in the form of a notched piece of wood known as a [[tally stick]]. Tallies originally came into use at a time when paper was rare and costly, but their use persisted until the early 19th century, even after paper money had become prevalent. The notches denoted various amounts of taxes payable to the Crown. Initially tallies were simply a form of receipt to the taxpayer at the time of rendering his dues. As the revenue department became more efficient, they began issuing tallies to denote a promise of the tax assessee to make future tax payments at specified times during the year. Each tally consisted of a matching pair – one stick was given to the assessee at the time of assessment representing the amount of taxes to be paid later, and the other held by the Treasury representing the amount of taxes to be collected at a future date.

The Treasury discovered that these tallies could also be used to create money. When the Crown had exhausted its current resources, it could use the tally receipts representing future tax payments due to the Crown as a form of payment to its own creditors, who in turn could either collect the tax revenue directly from those assessed or use the same tally to pay their own taxes to the government. The tallies could also be sold to other parties in exchange for gold or silver coin at a discount reflecting the length of time remaining until the tax was due for payment. Thus, the tallies became an accepted medium of exchange for some types of transactions and an accepted store of value. Like the girobanks before it, the Treasury soon realized that it could also issue tallies that were not backed by any specific assessment of taxes. By doing so, the Treasury created new money that was backed by public trust and confidence in the monarchy rather than by specific revenue receipts.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Glyn, [http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/RDavies/arian/llyfr.html ‘’A History of Money’’], University of Wales(England), 1994, pp. 146–151 {{ISBN|0-7083-1717-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goldsmith bankers===
[[Goldsmith]]s in England had been craftsmen, bullion merchants, money changers, and money lenders since the 16th century. But they were not the first to act as [[financial intermediates]]; in the early 17th century, the [[scrivener]]s were the first to keep deposits for the express purpose of relending them.&lt;ref&gt;Richards&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants and traders had amassed huge hoards of gold and entrusted their wealth to the [[Royal Mint]] for storage. In 1640 King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] seized the private gold stored in the mint as a forced loan (which was to be paid back over time). Thereafter merchants preferred to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London, who possessed private vaults, and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee (i.e., in trust). These receipts could not be assigned (only the original depositor could collect the stored goods). Gradually the goldsmiths took over the function of the scriveners of relending on behalf of a depositor and also developed modern banking practices; promissory notes were issued for money deposited which by custom and/or law was a loan to the goldsmith,&lt;ref&gt;Thus by the 19th century “[i]n ordinary cases of deposits of money with banking corporations, or bankers, the transaction amounts to a mere loan or mutuum, and the bank is to restore, not the same money, but an equivalent sum, whenever it is demanded”. Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments (1832, p. 66) and “Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal (see Parker v. Marchant, 1 Phillips 360); it is then the money of the banker, who is bound to return an equivalent by paying a similar sum to that deposited with him when he is asked for it.” [[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Lord Chancellor Cottenham]], ''[[Foley v Hill]]'' (1848) 2 HLC 28.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., the depositor expressly allowed the goldsmith to use the money for any purpose including advances to his customers. The goldsmith charged no fee, or even paid interest on these deposits. Since the [[promissory note]]s were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of [[fractional reserve banking]]. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument, which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Richards. The usual denomination was 50 or 100 pounds, so these notes were not an everyday currency for the common people.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence goldsmiths could advance loans in the form of gold money, or in the form of promissory notes, or in the form of checking accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Gold deposits were relatively stable, often remaining with the goldsmith for years on end, so there was little risk of default so long as public trust in the goldsmith's integrity and financial soundness was maintained. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of British banking and prominent creators of new money based on credit.

===Demand deposits===
[[Demand deposit]]s are funds that are deposited in bank accounts and are available for withdrawal at the discretion of the depositor. The withdrawal of funds from the account does not require contacting or making any type of prior arrangements with the bank or [[credit union]]. As long as the account balance is sufficient to cover the amount of the withdrawal, and the withdrawal takes place in accordance with procedures set in place by the financial institution, the funds may be withdrawn on demand.

The first European banknotes were issued by [[Stockholms Banco]], a predecessor of Sweden's central bank [[Sveriges Riksbank]], in 1661.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geisst|first=Charles R.|title=Encyclopedia of American business history|year=2005|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8160-4350-7|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; These replaced the copper-plates being used instead as a means of payment,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Gunnar Persson, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kYJtS1MdKlsC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Swedish+banknote+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=z1_LT5qeEdSp8QOZ17DWDw&amp;ved=0CGwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Swedish%20banknote%20history&amp;f=false ''An Economic History of Europe: Knowledge, Institutions and Growth, 600 to the Present''] Cambridge University Press, 28 January 2010, {{ISBN|052154940X}} – Retrieved 2012-06-03&lt;/ref&gt; although in 1664 the bank ran out of coins to redeem notes and ceased operating in the same year.

Inspired by the success of the London goldsmiths, some of whom became the forerunners of great English banks, banks began issuing paper notes quite properly termed "[[banknote]]s", which circulated in the same way that government-issued currency circulates today. In England this practice continued up to 1694. Scottish banks continued issuing notes until 1850, and still do issue banknotes backed by [[Bank of England]] notes. In the United States, this practice continued through the 19th century; at one time there were more than 5,000 different types of banknotes issued by various commercial banks in America. Only the notes issued by the largest, most creditworthy banks were widely accepted. The scrip of smaller, lesser-known institutions circulated locally. Farther from home it was only accepted at a discounted rate, if at all. The proliferation of types of money went hand in hand with a multiplication in the number of financial institutions.

These banknotes were a form of representative money which could be converted into gold or silver by application at the bank. Since banks issued notes far in excess of the gold and silver they kept on deposit, sudden loss of public confidence in a bank could precipitate mass redemption of banknotes and result in bankruptcy.

The use of banknotes issued by private commercial banks as [[legal tender]] has gradually been replaced by the issuance of bank notes authorized and controlled by national governments. The [[Bank of England]] was granted sole rights to issue banknotes in England after 1694. In the United States, the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] was granted similar rights after its establishment in 1913. Until recently, these government-authorized currencies were forms of representative money, since they were partially backed by gold or silver and were theoretically convertible into gold or silver.

==1990 - present==
The development of computer technology in the second part of the twentieth century allowed money to be represented digitally. By 1990, in the United States all money transferred between its central bank and commercial banks was in electronic form.  By the 2000s most money existed as [[digital currency]] in banks databases.&lt;ref&gt;https://money.howstuffworks.com/currency6.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, by number of transaction, 20 to 58 percent of transactions were electronic (dependant on country).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150724-the-truth-about-the-death-of-cash&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Cryptocurrencies===
{{main|Cryptocurrency}}
In 2008, [[Bitcoin]] was proposed by an unknown author/s under the pseudonym of [[Satoshi Nakamoto]], it was implemented the same year. Its use of [[cryptography]] allowed the currency to have a trustless, fungible and tamper resistant [[distributed ledger]] called a [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]]. It became the first widely used [[decentralized]], [[peer-to-peer]], [[cryptocurrency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/11/economist-explains-1|last1=S.|first1=L.|title=Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?|accessdate=3 November 2015|publisher=The Economist|work=The Economist explains|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.{{Cite web|url=https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf|title=Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System|last=Nakamoto|first=Satoshi|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other comparable systems had been proposed since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.koehntopp.de/uploads/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF|title=Blind signatures for untraceable payments|last=Chaum|first=David|date=1982|website=|publisher=Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cryptographic protocol|protocol]] proposed by Nakamoto solved what is known as the [[double-spending]] problem without the need of a trusted third-party.

Since Bitcoin's inception, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been introduced,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/|title=All Cryptocurrencies {{!}} CoinMarketCap|website=coinmarketcap.com|language=en|access-date=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ktorpey/2017/12/29/comparing-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-by-market-cap-can-be-very-misleading/#1f9386b42509|title=Comparing Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies by 'Market Cap' Can Be Very Misleading

==Money supply==
{{main|Money supply}}
In modern times economists have sort to classify the different types of [[money supply]]. The different measures of the money supply have been classified by various [[central bank]]s, using the prefix "M". The supply classifications often depend on how narrowly a supply is specified, for example the "M"s may range from M0 (narrowest) to M3 (broadest). The classifications depend on the particular policy formulation used:

* '''{{visible anchor|M0}}''': In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, M0 includes bank reserves, so M0 is referred to as the monetary base, or narrow money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moneyterms.co.uk/m0/ M0 (monetary base)]. Moneyterms.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''MB''': is referred to as the [[monetary base]] or total currency. This is the base from which other forms of money (like checking deposits, listed below) are created and is traditionally the most liquid measure of the money supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m0.asp|title= M0|accessdate=2008-07-20 |publisher= Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''M1''': Bank reserves are not included in M1.
* '''M2''': Represents M1 and "close substitutes" for M1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m2.asp|title= M2|accessdate=2008-07-20 |publisher= Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; M2 is a broader classification of money than M1. M2 is a key economic indicator used to forecast inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investorwords.com/2909/M2.html|title= M2 Definition|accessdate=2008-07-20 |publisher= InvestorWords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''M3''': M2 plus large and long-term deposits. Since 2006, M3 is no longer published by the U.S. central bank.&lt;ref name="fedM3disc"&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/h6/discm3.htm "Discontinuance of M3"], Federal Reserve, November 10, 2005, revised March 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are still estimates produced by various private institutions.
* '''MZM''': Money with zero maturity. It measures the supply of financial assets redeemable at par on demand. [[Velocity of money|Velocity]] of MZM is historically a relatively accurate predictor of [[inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aziz|first=John|title=Is Inflation Always And Everywhere a Monetary Phenomenon?|url=http://azizonomics.com/2013/03/10/is-inflation-always-and-everywhere-a-monetary-phenomenon/|work=Azizonomics|accessdate=2 April 2013|date=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thayer|first=Gary|title=Investors should assume that inflation will exceed the Fed's target|url=http://www.firstclearing.com/download/investors-should-assume-inflation-will-exceed-feds-target/|work=Macro Strategy|publisher=Wells Fargo Advisors|accessdate=2 April 2013|date=January 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlson|first=John B.|author2=Benjamin D.

'''Hone Te Kauru Taiapa''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|MBE|size=85%}} (10 August 1911 – 10 May 1979), also known as '''John Taiapa''',&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB|title=Taiapa, Hone Te Kauru |first= Angela |last=Ballara |id=4t2 |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[wood carver]] and [[carpenter]] of [[Ngati Porou]].  He was the younger brother of master Māori carver [[Pine Taiapa]].&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;{{cite book|last = Dunn |first = Michael| title = New Zealand Sculpture: A History|page = 130|publisher = Auckland University Press|date = 2002|isbn=978-1-86940-277-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two brothers worked closely with politician [[Āpirana Ngata|Sir Apirana Ngata]] on reintroducing Māori sculpture to the country after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt;  Both men, for example, demonstrated Māori carving skills by carving traditional homes on the [[North Island, New Zealand|North Island]] in [[marae]] as part of a programme by the [[Department of Education (New Zealand)|New Zealand Department of Education]] to educate teachers to reintroduce Māori arts to school children.&lt;ref name="Dunn" /&gt; New Zealand poet [[Hone Tuwhare]] included a poem about the wood carver, "On a theme by Hone Taiapa," in his 1973 collection ''Something Nothing''.&lt;ref name=Tuwhare&gt;{{cite book|last=Tuwhare|first=Hone|title=Deep River Talk: Collected Poems by Hone Tuwhare|translator=Frank Stewart|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|date=1994|isbn=978-0-8248-1607-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He led the team of carvers that carved most of the pieces for ''Arohanui ki te Tangata'' in Lower Hutt, which was opened in September 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNZB|title=Puketapu, Ihaia Porutu|first=Te Rira |last=Puketapu |id=5p39 |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1960 Birthday Honours|1960 Queen's Birthday Honours]], Taiapa was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire]] for cultural services to the Māori people, especially in the field of wood carving.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=42053 |date=11 June 1960 |page=4017 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the head of the [[New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute]] Carving School at [[Whakarewarewa]], [[Rotorua]] when it opened in 1967.

'''iSpring Suite''' is a [[rapid learning]] [[Authoring system|authoring toolkit]] produced by iSpring for developing training  courses in [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] with embedded (or standalone) quizzes, surveys, and interactions. Its output is compatible with mainstream [[Learning management system|LMS]] standards ([[SCORM]]/[[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee|AICC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Creating_SCORM_Content|title=Creating SCORM Content|work=docs.moodle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ispringsolutions.com/articles/lms_support.html|title=LMS support|work=ispringsolutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and there is also an option to publish courses specially for [[Blackboard Learning System|BlackBoard LMS]]. The new [[Tin Can API|xAPI (Tin Can)]] format for [[Learning Record Store|LRSes]] is supported as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tincanapi.com/adopters|title=Adopters|work=tincanapi.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Output can be a solid [[SWF| SWF file(s)]], [[EXE| EXE file]], [[HTML]] page or [[Zip (file format)|ZIP]] archive. Additionally, the cross-platform output format ([[Adobe Flash|Flash]] + [[HTML5]]) allows published content to be viewed on any type of modern device.

==History==
In 2005, Flashspring Pro, the prototype of all iSpring products, was released. It was a simple PowerPoint-to-Flash converter with free and commercial versions. Later, iSpring released Flashspring Ultra and [[Sharable Content Object Reference Model|SCORM]] compatibility became available. The companion products FlashSpring Lite and FlashSpring Server were released in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2008 the name was changed to iSpring. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/745/making-sense-of-powerpoint-pandemonium|title=Making Sense of PowerPoint Pandemonium|work=learningsolutionsmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current version of iSpring Suite, iSpring Suite 9.0, came out in April 24th, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elearningindustry.com/press-releases/ispring-suite-9-fast-toolkit-creating-elearning-slides-quizzes-videos|title=iSpring Suite 9: Fast Toolkit For Creating eLearning Slides, Quizzes, And Videos|work=elearningindustry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iSpring Suite 7===
One enhancement made to iSpring Suite 7 was the support of combined, cross-platform [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] + [[HTML5]] format. It allowed users to create mobile-ready projects that adapt to any screen size and orientation.

iSpring Suite 7 came with free mobile apps for iOS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ispring-viewer/id642452385?mt=8|title=iSpring Viewer on the App Store on iTunes|work=[[iOS App Store]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Android,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ispringsolutions.mplayer&amp;hl=en |title=iSpring Mobile Player - Android Apps |via=[[Google Play]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allow offline content viewing. The apps collect statistics on learning activity even with no Internet connection and send them to an LMS once the connection is restored.

===iSpring Suite 8===
iSpring Suite 8 introduces several new features to the toolkit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/1804/ispring-suite-8-massive-new-features-not-found-in-standard-elearning-packages|title=iSpring Suite 8: Massive New Features Not Found in Standard eLearning Packages|work=learningsolutionsmag.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In version 8, a conversation simulator was added, allowing users to create simulated dialogues. Also, iSpring Suite 8 has a screen recording tool, allowing users to capture the screen and insert the recording on a PowerPoint slide, an audio/video editor both for screen recordings and audio/video narrations, and a video lecture player to show PowerPoint slides and lecture video side by side.

=== iSpring Suite 9 ===
Released in April 2018, the 9th version introduced 14 new interactions, a new built-in video editor with extended capabilities for screen recording, and major improvements of the quiz editor: the new [[Drag and drop|drag-and-drop]] question, the new built-in [[equation]] editor, extended feedback options, and 7 new survey question templates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/toolkit-ispring-suite-9-adds-a-lot-of-great-new-features|title=Toolkit: iSpring Suite 9 Adds a Lot of Great New Features|work=learningsolutionsmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
iSpring Suite includes 5 authoring components: the iSpring add-in, iSpring QuizMaker, conversation simulator, screen recording tool and iSpring Visuals — a set of standalone tools that can be used both separately and together. Additional components available in the publishing interface are PowerPoint-to-Video/YouTube (available separately as iSpring SlideAlloy), and iSpring Cloud hosting and sharing platform.

===iSpring Converter Pro===
iSpring Converter Pro turns PowerPoint projects into mobile-ready online presentations. It supports the standard PowerPoint features such as animation, transition effects and narration facilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-cool-add-ins-for-office-2007-and-2010/2455|title=10 cool add-ins for Office 2007 and 2010|work=techrepublic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contains additional features that aren't provided by PowerPoint, such as publishing to the Web or an [[Learning Management System|LMS]]. 

===iSpring QuizMaker===
iSpring QuizMaker allows users to create quizzes and surveys.

===iSpring Visuals===
iSpring Visuals adds rich media [[Interaction model|interactions]] to PowerPoint presentations.

===iSpring TalkMaster===
iSpring TalkMaster is a conversation simulator that allows users to create simulated dialogues for customer support training and other purposes.

===iSpring ScreenRecorder===
iSpring ScreenRecorder allows users to capture all or part of a screen and insert the recording on a PowerPoint slide, save it to MP4 video, or publish it to a YouTube account.

===iSpring SlideAlloy===
iSpring SlideAlloy converts PowerPoint presentations to videos in .mp4 format, or publishes them to YouTube.

===iSpring Cloud===
iSpring Cloud is a hosting and delivery platform for PowerPoint presentations, Microsoft documents and spreadsheets, images, video, audio, and PDF files.

In [[music]], an '''interdominant''' is a '''temporary dominant''', the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] of a [[key (music)|key]] other than the [[tonic (music)|tonic]].&lt;ref&gt;Blom, Eric (2008). ''Dictionary of Music'', p.263. {{ISBN|1-4437-3452-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since a composition [[common practice period|generally]] begins and ends with the tonic, the dominant of notes other than the tonic would be found in the middle.

The '''International Union of Psychological Science''', abbreviated '''IUPsyS''' or '''the Union''', is the global umbrella organization for [[psychology]]. The Unions president is [[Saths Cooper]] of [[South Africa]], and the vice-president is [[Tor Levin Hofgaard]] of [[Norway]] both of which were elected in 2012.

Founded in 1950, IUPsyS represents around one million psychologists worldwide. It is composed of 82 National Members &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iupsys.net/index.php/members/national-members&lt;/ref&gt; (national psychology organizations or coalitions of national psychology organizations, one per country), and 17 affiliate or special liaison organizations. Together, these organizations represent the large majority of organized psychology today.

The overall mission &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iupsys.net/index.php/about/aims&lt;/ref&gt; of IUPsyS as specified in its [[statute]]s &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iupsys.net/images/archive/statutes/iupsys-statutes-rules-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is the development, representation and advancement of psychology as a basic and applied science regionally, nationally, and internationally. This is accomplished through a variety of activities including quadrennial international congresses (the IUPsyS is the sponsor of the International Congress of Psychology), regional conferences, and workshops; publications; [[capacity building]]; development of standards; promulgation of policy; and information dissemination.

IUPsyS operates according to a strategic plan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iupsys.net/images/archive/strategicplan/2008-strategicplan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; IUPsyS is a member of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icsu.org www.icsu.org&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Social Science Council]] (ISSC), and is accredited with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), and the [[United Nations]] ([[ECOSOC]] and [[United Nations Department of Public Information|DPI]]).

The ''[[International Journal of Psychology]]'' (''IJP'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Journal of Psychology|url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/pijp|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the official journal of the IUPsyS, published by Psychology Press. It provides articles and reviews in every domain of psychology and informs the international community about issues of common interest in its International Platform Section.

The IUPsyS website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iupsys.org&lt;/ref&gt; provides information about IUPsyS and its activities. IUPsyS hosts Psychology Resources Around the World,&lt;ref&gt;http://iupsys.net/index.php/patw-resources&lt;/ref&gt; a web portal with information on the organizations and structure of psychology in 190 countries, and links to psychology information and resources around the world. Other publications include a news Bulletin, Newsletter, informational brochures, and books including a History of the Union, the International Handbook of Psychology, and an international compendium of Psychological Concepts.

The activities undertaken by the IUPsyS are generally organized through its three Standing Committees: Strategic Planning, Capacity Building, Publications and Communications, and their associated Work Groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://iupsys.net/index.php/governance/iupsys-committeesworkgroups&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Frederick Cotton''' (January 21, 1922 – May 5, 2016) was an American military test pilot.

==Early life==
Cotton was born in [[Rushville, Indiana]] on Jan. 21, 1922, the only son of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph A. Cotton. Cotton was a graduate of Manilla High School where he was a member of the basketball team and a 4H club member. He lived in Rush County and helped his father with work on the family farm until he reached the age of 20.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Military Service==
In his first combat mission, in November 1943, the plane he was co-piloting crash landed on the island of Corfu after being hit by anti-aircraft fire. After four months the crew members were able to escape with the help of Italian allies, and Mr. Cotton was sent back to the U.S. to recover from malaria and return to flight school&lt;ref name="Bridge"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wood|first1=Barbara|title=Hometown names bridge after longtime Atherton resident Joe Cotton|url=https://www.almanacnews.com/news/2017/07/13/hometown-names-bridge-after-longtime-atherton-resident-joe-cotton|website=The Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become a flight instructor.&lt;ref name="C6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afternoon with a Flight Test Legend|url=http://www.check-six.com/lib/Cotton_interview.htm|website=Check-Six.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later attended the Empire Test Pilot School, and eventually was the chief test pilot for the Air Force. He was head of the B-58 Hustler and XB-70 test programs, and was flying in the ill-fated formation flight that resulted in [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie#Mid-air collision|the loss of XB-70 A/V2 on June 8, 1966]].&lt;ref name="C6" /&gt; He retired from the Air Force in 1968 having been involved in aeronautical research for 22 of his 26 years.

'''Kenya Institute of Puppet Theatre''' also known as KIPT is a [[Kenya]]n [[non-governmental]] and [[non-profit]] technical advisory and management [[community]] based theatre institute, which was founded in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kiptkenya.org/|title=Kenya Institute of Puppet Theatre|publisher=KIPT-Kenya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KIPT uses [[puppetry]], participatory educational [[theatre]] and folk media in life skills promotion, community education and cultural communication that, according to KIPT, engages people into interactive discourse.

==History==

KIPT was founded by a team of puppet and theatre practitioners for the purpose of harnessing puppetry and folk media theatre experiences and using them for socioeconomic and environmental change. 
The organization seeks to contribute to the improvement of the livelihoods of the youth and the larger community through the promotion of greater personal and community involvement, accountability, awareness, growth and development, mainly in [[Kenya]] and [[Africa]].

KIPT has hosted several festivals, which have taken place in [[Nairobi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrewithoutborders.com/node/3313 |title=6th International Puppetry Festival (“IPfest 2014”) Nairobi, KENYA |publisher=Theatre Without Borders |date=21 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514174555/http://www.theatrewithoutborders.com/node/3313 |archivedate=14 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kenyanpuppet.blogspot.com/|title=The Puppet Theatre Platform - Kenya|author=Puppet Platform|publisher=|date=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KIPT was initially called CHAPS (Community Health Awareness Puppeteers), which began in 1994 when a group of [[South Africa]]n puppeteers, led by Gary Friedman, director of the African Research and Educational Development Program, were invited to [[Kenya]] by Dr Eric Krystall of FPPS in Nairobi to train local Kenyans to start their own program to combat [[HIV-AIDS]] in Kenya. A local program of "Puppets Against Aids" was set up in Nairobi and twenty years later, the group has expanded and strengthened their training, resources and outreach. Now, hundreds of puppeteers continue their outreach work through Eastern and Central Africa.

==Aims==

According to KIPT their aims are as follow:

* Create, teach and be taught, produce, market and share puppet theatre with communities in Kenya and the rest of the world.
* Tutor young disadvantaged youth for a professional career in puppetry
* Make puppet theatre accessible to everybody, especially the disenfranchised whose social circumstances restrict their access to theatre and other art education and [[entertainment]] forms.
* Encourage [[creativity]], improve [[puppetry]] skills, and enhance the quality of puppet theatre performances by exposing Kenyan and African puppeteers and audiences to contemporary puppetry techniques, skills and professional performances.
* Network and collaborate with other theatre institutions, companies and artists in Kenya, Africa and the world in the furtherance of its vision.
* Cooperate with other art supporting and art friendly organizations around the globe in pursuance of its objectives, development of [[puppet theatre]] and promotion of social development and equity for all the people of the world.

==Performances==
* KIPT performed "the last man standing" in 2010. It is a story about a brave [[wildebeest]] called Mara, who goes though different stages of her life and then ends up as [[Cadaver|carcass]]. The story takes place in 2070 and is told by using [[bones]]. It was performed the first time on 9 April 2010 in Kenya at the Italien Institute of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpps-puppets.org/doc/STANDING%20PUPPETRY%20PERFORMANCE.pdf|title="The Last Man Standing" Puppetry Performance|publisher=Family Programme Promotion Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?id=2000007779&amp;cid=482&amp;articleID=2000007779|title=Standard Digital News - Kenya :  The last man standing|author=Kiundu Waweru|publisher=Standard Digital News|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The last man standing" have been performed in [[Nairobi]], [[Mombasa]], [[South Africa]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jakartajive.com/2012/11/wayang-dari-china-kenya-ramaikan-wayang.html|author=Burhan Abe
|title=Wayang dari China &amp; Kenya Ramaikan Wayang Summit 2012|date=26 November 2012|publisher=Jakarta Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* KIPT (back then as CHAPS) performed "Puppets against Corruption", which is a performance about the [[corruption]] in Kenya that portrays the corruption using the world of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOeBQ0Fypyo|author=Gary Friedman Productions|date=7 January 2008|title=African Puppetry Series - CHAPS, Kenya|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was a part of the "Puppets against Corruption" project, which involved a series of [[Corruption|anti-corruption]] performances and gave information about corruption's consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comminit.com/fragile-contexts/content/brief-evaluation-report-puppets-good-governance-pgg-project|author=Phylemon Odhiambo|date=1 January 2004|title=Brief Evaluation Report of the Puppets for Good Governance (PGG) Project|work=The Communication Initiative Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consultancies==

The organization has undertaken consultancies in the designing of learning materials, facilitation of workshops, training in puppetry and folk media for national and international organizations. These include; [[Netherlands Leprosy Relief]],  Aktion Africa Hilfe, [[UNICEF]], Merlin International,  German Development Cooperation (GIZ), [[Lutheran World Federation]], SNV, [[PLAN International]], [[UNHCR]], [[World Vision]], [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]], [[British Council]], Warner and Consorten, DSW, Action Aid Kenya, [[Family Health International]], Family Care International and the Association of AIDS Organisation (TASO) in Uganda, among others.

It has initiated puppetry projects in [[Nigeria]], [[Eritrea]], [[Sudan]], [[Somalia]], [[Uganda]] and [[Liberia]] and participated in collaborative puppetry projects in [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]], [[South Africa]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]] and [[Australia]].

''Modern Fantasy'' followed Pringle's ''[[Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels]]'', published by Xanadu in 1985. In the introduction he commends the nearly simultaneous "rival" followup by Xanadu: [[Stephen Jones (author)|Stephen Jones]] and [[Kim Newman]]'s ''Horror: The 100 Best Books'' (Xanadu, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Fantasy'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact Xanadu had followed with at least three more books in its [[Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels#100 Best series |100 Best series]]: ''Crime and Mystery'' in 1987, both ''Horror'' and ''Fantasy'' in 1988. Xanadu had commissioned [[Michael Moorcock]] to write ''Fantasy'', but Moorcock transferred the project to [[James Cawthorn (artist)|James Cawthorn]] when it became "clear that [he] would not be able to deliver it for a long time".&lt;ref&gt;Moorcock, "Introduction", p. 9; ''Fantasy: The 100 Best Books'', Cawthorn and Moorcock, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ISFDB, Pringle's ''Modern Fantasy'' was released in October 1988, September 1989 in the U.S.; Xanadu's ''Fantasy'' was released in November and published almost simultaneously by [[Carroll and Graf]] in the U.S.

==Modern Fantasy==
Pringle says in the introduction, rebutting one academic complaint about the sprawling scope of fantasy, "But it seems to me that fantasy ''is'' an indiscriminate form. ... We may even view it as the primal genre, essentially formless, a swamp which has served as the breeding ground for all other popular fiction genres ... Up to the eighteenth century, almost all narrative fictions, both verse and prose, were fantastic to a greater or lesser degree."&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Fantasy'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to the earlier book, he had distinguished "Supernatural Horror" and "[[Heroic fantasy]]" as the other important divisions of fantastic fiction beside science fiction. They may be represented by ''[[Dracula]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', featuring "the irruption of some supernatural force into the everyday world" and "set in completely imaginary worlds" respectively. Here he adds "the Fabulation, or absurdist metafiction—stories which are set in the real world, but which distort that world in ways other than the supernaturally horrific." He names Thomas Pynchon, Angela Carter, John Crowley, and Geoff Ryman as authors of fabulations included in his hundred.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Fantasy'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

While covering no foreign-language fantasies and few children's or 'light' fantasies, "I have tried to make a balanced list, and in so doing I have included some books which are not really to my taste—they may well be other people's favourites, though. In truth, there are not a hundred masterpieces of modern fantasy, any more than there a hundred masterpieces of science fiction."&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Fantasy'', 20.&lt;/ref&gt; "[A]t least some of the novels I have selected are masterpieces of modern literature, full of beauty and wonder. The others are craftsmanlike entertainments which I happily commend to you for your enjoyment."&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Fantasy'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moreška''' {{IPAc-en|m|oʊ|ˈ|r|ɛ|ʃ|k|ə}} is a traditional [[sword dance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korculainfo.com/moreska_korcula.htm|title=The Moreška Dance|publisher=korculainfo.com|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korcula.net/naselja/korcula/moreska.htm|title=Moreška|publisher=korcula.net|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the town of [[Korčula (town)|Korčula]], on the [[Croatia]]n island of the same name in the [[Adriatic]]. Dating back hundreds of years, the Moreška is an elaborate production involving two groups of dancers, engaging in a mock battle over the fate of a veiled young woman.  Originally performed rarely on special occasions, in modern times the Moreška is performed weekly for visiting tourists. The two sides of battling dancers were originally [[Moros y cristianos|Moors and Christians]], recalling the Spanish battles of the [[Reconquista]] in the Middle Ages. However, at some point in the 19th century in Korčula, the sides changed from Christians vs. [[Moors]], to [[Croatians|Croats]] vs. Moors, or simply "White" and "Black", with the non-Moor side emerging victorious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[National Geographic Hrvatska]]|language=Croatian|title=Moreška, posljednji autentični mačevalački ples Mediterana (''trans: The last authentic sword dance of the Mediterranean'')|author=Rostuhar, Davor|date=October 2009|volume=8|issue=70|pages=96&amp;ndash;107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Moreška in Korčula dates back to at least the mid-17th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=L8THMGyJKRmfkzvLh7vNHtjGhTsLbjXwVzhy2TYD1HSrPRJLSjKL!-1177698421!-1406243862?docId=5006690602|title=Blackened faces and a veiled woman: The early Korcula Moreska|authors=Max Harris, Lada Cale Feldman|journal=Comparative Drama|volume=37|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Korčulanska Moreška|publisher=Turistička zajednica Grada Korčule|editor=[[Elsie Dunin|Dunin, Elsie Ivancich]]|isbn=953-95471-0-5|year=2006|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its roots in the Middle Ages, from the several hundred years of battle between Muslims and Christians ([[Moros y cristianos]]) in Spain, specially in Catalonia where exist a traditional dance called [[La Morisca de Gerri de la Sal]], during the [[Reconquista]].  Multiple European festivals and pageants have their roots from that time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris, Max|title=Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: festivals of reconquest in Mexico|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0-292-73132-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century the conquest theme with mock battles was introduced into the Americas and other world areas administered or culturally influenced by Spain. The version that is danced in Korčula appears to be the only one in modern times which uses two swords held by each soldier (''Moreškanti'') in the elaborate mock battles.

==Performances==
The Moreška was originally performed on special occasions only, perhaps once every few years, especially on the Feast Day of "Sveti Todor" ([[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore]], Korčula's patron saint) in July, in a lavish presentation which could last for up to two hours. In modern times there are abbreviated performances of 20–30 minutes which occur weekly in the summer for visiting tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croatiatraveller.com/southern_dalmatia/korcula/Moreska.htm|title=Moreska Sword Dance|accessdate=December 31, 2009|publisher=croatiatraveller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performers must be native to Korčula, and local families take great pride in their participation.

* Moro: The Black King
* Osman: The White King (who wears red)
* Otmanović: The Black King's father

==Plot==
The Black King enters dragging the captured Bula maiden in chains. He tries to persuade her to respond to his advances, but she replies that she is in love with the White King. The two kings and their armies confront each other, and battle escalates from taunts, to the kings in battle, to both armies clashing, with a mixture of solos and varying rhythms through seven different dances. The Black soldiers are eventually surrounded and defeated, and the White King rescues the Bula.

== Sword dance societies ==
There are two societies (groups) which perform the Moreška in the town of Korčula, and other societies on the island which perform another variant of sword dance, known as the '''Kumpanija'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korcula.net/grad/sword/festival.htm|title=Kumpanija Sword Festival|publisher=korcula.net|accessdate=January 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain towns and villages have Kumpanija groups, which perform on the respective village feast day, as well as on other festive dates during the summer tourist season:

* [[Vela Luka]], performed March 19, St. Joseph
*[[Blato, Korčula|Blato]], performed on April 28, the day of [[Saint Vincenca]] and during the summer months
* [[Čara]], performed a few times per year, including June 29, [[Saint Peter]]'s Day
* [[Pupnat]], August 5, on the Feast of Our Lady of the Snow
* [[Smokvica]], performed on August 14, the [[Feast of the Assumption]]
* [[Žrnovo, Korcula|Žrnovo]], August 16, on [[Saint Roch]]'s Day

'''Music software''' is [[software]] used for [[musical composition]], [[digital recording]], the creation of [[electronic music]], and other musical applications. Music software has been around for nearly 40 years.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=David|title=Music Software and Emerging Technology.|journal=Music Educators Journal|date=November 1992|volume= 79|series=No. 3|pages=22–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen to have profound impacts on education involving music and creative expression. Musical software has become an outlet for people who do not bond with traditional musical instruments, giving people new and creative ways to compose and perform music in ways that has never been seen before.&lt;ref name=Nikolaidou&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nikolaidou|first=Georgia|title=A New Insight In Puplis’ Collaborative Talk, Actions and Balance During a Computer-Mediated Music Task.|journal=Computers and Education|date=22 Feb 2010|pages=720–740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Music software development dates back to the 1960s and 70s.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; While this software was at best primitive, it nonetheless helped lay the foundation for the future development of the software and synthetic musical production. The early music software was run on large computers at several universities such as Stanford and Penn State.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; Much of what development came to music software came as a result of the continuous improvement to computers over time.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; Chain of development is seen clearly in 1978 when nearly 50 music programs came out as a result of MIDI technology, a form of computer communication still used today.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; MIDI technology provided the key link in hardware for musical software, giving a person a tactile control of an instrument and playing directly into the software in the computer and allowing for maximum control of the production.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt;  Fourth generation music software came out in the early 1990s. The largest improvement with this software was the addition of more detailed displays allowing the music software to show more on the screen making the program much easier to use and understand.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt;
An important recent development is to automatically transcribe performed music directly to sheet music as developed by [[Scorecloud|ScoreCloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glass|first1=Nick|title=Is this Google Translate for Music|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/business/2014/06/19/spc-make-create-innovate-scorecloud.cnn.html|website=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are many different music making software packages. 

==Effects==
The effects of music software are seen in almost every song heard today in one way or another.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt; More than ever before, songs are being recorded into DAWs (digital audio workstations) because of their ease of use and their ability to easily manipulate audio files. Much of what used to take a team of professionals to do in a recording studio can now be done on a single computer.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt;

==Education==
Music software has led to new ways of education in relation to music.&lt;ref name=Nikolaidou /&gt; New and emerging science and studies are proving that music software is an effective way in making students more creative at a younger age by providing them with all of the instruments they could ever want within one, streamlined music program.&lt;ref name=Nikolaidou /&gt; With live loop and sample playing DAWS that can play multiple samples of audio or midi files live with a controller triggering these samples, a new breed of instruments are available to students, allowing them to express themselves in ways never before seen.&lt;ref name=Nikolaidou /&gt;

Various schools and colleges have emerged with courses in Music Production and more so in electronic music production. Every Continent has at-least one such notable institute with The North American and European continents leading the way forward. Among the most popular among the youth are, in no specific order: 
*[[Berklee]] -USA 
*[http://dbsmusic.co.uk/ dBs Music] - UK
*[http://www.subaqueousmusic.com.com/ Subaqueous Music] - USA

*[http://www.garnishmusicproduction.com/ Garnish Music Production Courses] -UK 
*DBS Music - Germany 
*[[ILM Academy]] - India 
*Alchemea College - UK 
*[[SAE Institute|SAE]] -Australia

==The future==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=February 2017}}
Computers have now been made that can improvise music scores on their own, using complex algorithms.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Oliver|title=Experiments in Modular Design for the Creative Composition of Live Algorithms.|journal=Centre for Electronic Media Art|date=29 Aug 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While functioning on a mathematical algorithm, it is nevertheless producing notes of its own without human instruction. Educators are beginning to recognize that computers hold the future of music.&lt;ref name=Nikolaidou /&gt; The software being developed for these machines will take music to new and startling heights with the help of computer-based production.&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt;

The '''National Council of Culture and the Arts''' ('''CNCA''') was the [[Chile]]an government agency responsible for arts and cultural policy.  The Council was founded in 2003 and amalgamated arts and cultural policy under a single agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consejodelacultura.cl/portal/galeria/text/text106.pdf Ley del Consejo Nacional de la Cultura y las Artes] (Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a cabinet-level position in the Chilean position.  Since the Council was founded, six ministers have been in charge of the Council: [[José Weinstein]] under President [[Ricardo Lagos Escobar]], [[Paulina Urrutia]] under President [[Michelle Bachelet]], [[Luciano Cruz-Coke]] and [[Roberto Ampuero]] under President [[Sebastián Piñera]], Claudia Barattini and [[Ernesto Ottone]] under the second period of President Michelle Bachelet.

Since 2004, CNCA has awarded the [[Pablo Neruda Order of Artistic and Cultural Merit]] to international figures who have stood out for contributions made in the field of art and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.elmostrador.cl/cultura/2007/12/01/otorgan-a-musico-cubano-leo-brouwer-la-orden-al-merito-pablo-neruda/?php%20bloginfo(%27url%27);%20?%3E/cultura |title=Otorgan a músico cubano Leo Brouwer la Orden al Mérito Pablo Neruda |trans-title=Cuban Musician Leo Brouwer Awarded the Pablo Neruda Order of Merit |work=[[El Mostrador]] |language=Spanish |date=1 December 2007 |access-date=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Pablo Neruda Ibero-American Poetry Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.laestafetadelviento.es/actualidad/noticias/ganador-del-premio-iberoamericano-de-poesia-pablo-neruda |title=Ganador del Premio Iberoamericano de Poesía Pablo Neruda |trans-title=Winner of the Pablo Neruda Ibero-American Poetry Award |work=La Estefeta del Viento |language=Spanish |date=24 January 2012 |access-date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, as a result of Law No. 19.981, CNCA has given the [[Pedro Sienna Awards]] for Chilean audiovisual production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2006/01/14/207835/cine-nuevos-premios-pedro-sienna-entregaron-sus-primeros-nominados.html |title=Cine: Nuevos premios Pedro Sienna entregaron sus primeros nominados |trans-title=Film: New Pedro Sienna Awards Announce Their First Nominees |work=[[El Mercurio]] |location=Santiago |language=Spanish |date=14 January 2006 |access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">'''''Pabása ng Pasyón''''' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "Reading of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]"), known simply as '''''Pabása''''' is a [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholic]] devotion in the [[Philippines]] popular during [[Holy Week in the Philippines|Holy Week]] involving the uninterrupted chanting of the ''[[Pasyon|Pasyón]]'', an early 16th-century [[epic poem]] narrating the life, [[Passion of Christ|passion]], death, and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=Inq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090407-198285/Pabasa-is-for-meditating-not-loud-wailing|title=‘Pabasa’ is for meditating, not loud wailing|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=30 June 2011|last=Pazzibugan|first=Dona|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118175409/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090407-198285/Pabasa-is-for-meditating-not-loud-wailing|archivedate=18 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verses are based on the bible and practiced every holy week.

==Description==
Readers are usually groups of individuals taking turns in chanting verses from the book known as the ''[[Pasyon]]'', as a devotion made in fulfilment of a ''panatà'' (this may be a vow, votive offering in request, or thanksgiving).&lt;ref name=Inq/&gt; The modern-day ''Pabasa'' may be chanted ''[[a cappella]]'' or with the accompaniment of musical instruments such as the guitar, accordion, piano, or by a ''[[rondalla]]'' ensemble. 

There are two common styles of chanting, the first of which is the alternate singing of two persons or two groups of people. The second method has each chanter or group of chanters taking turns in singing the stanzas.

==Origins==
Before evolving into the contemporary ritual, early forms of the Pabasa were introduced to the various indigenous peoples of the archipelago by Spanish friars spreading the Roman Catholic faith.&lt;ref name=PN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinenews.com/community/1599-pabasa-in-new-jersey.html|title=Pabasa in New Jersey|publisher=Philippine News|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the period of [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish colonial rule]] from the late 16th century until 1898, indigenous Filipinos adapted the religious chanting of the Spanish priests and incorporated it to the ancient custom of singing epics during celebrations. The vocal singing style has in many ways, preserved the pre-Hispanic singing techniques of the main groups of the country, like the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Ilokano people|Ilocano]] and [[Visayan]] [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|ethnic groups]].&lt;ref name=BF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangusfestival2011.com/news/pabasa-golgotha-part-of-bangus-festival.html|title=Pabasa, Golgotha Part of Bangus Festival 2011|publisher=Dagupan City Bangus Festival 2011|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duration==
The reading and chanting ritual, which is more common in rural areas, may be sponsored by local religious organisations. The Pabasa is done continuously day and night and usually lasts for three consecutive days.&lt;ref name=MB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/250088/pabasa-begins-monday|title='Pabasa' begins this Monday|last=Hermoso|first=Christina|publisher=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pabasa may begin on [[Holy Monday]], the second day of [[Holy Week]];&lt;ref name=MB/&gt; or it may also start in the afternoon of [[Maundy Thursday]].&lt;ref name=Inq/&gt;   If started on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], the pabasa usually ends on the morning of [[Good Friday]].&lt;ref name=Inq/&gt;

'''Palaeography''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|UK]]) or '''paleography''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Simplification of ae and oe|US]]; ultimately from {{lang-grc-gre|{{linktext|παλαιός}}}}, ''palaiós'', "old", and {{lang|grc|{{linktext|γράφειν}}}}, ''graphein'', "to write") is the study of ancient and historical [[handwriting]] (that is to say, of the forms and processes of writing; not the textual content of documents). Included in the discipline is the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;'Palaeography', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the cultural context of writing, including the methods with which writing and books were produced, and the history of [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civiceducationproject.org/legacy/projects/paleography/index.html |title=Latin Palaeography Network |publisher=Civiceducationproject.org |date= |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline is important for understanding, authenticating, and dating ancient texts. However, it cannot in general be used to pinpoint dates with high precision.

== Application ==
Palaeography can be an essential skill for [[historian]]s and [[philology|philologists]], as it tackles two main difficulties. First, since the style of a single [[alphabet]] in each given language has evolved constantly, it is necessary to know how to decipher its individual characters as they existed in various eras. Second, [[scribe]]s often used many [[abbreviation]]s, usually so as to write more quickly and sometimes to save space, so the specialist-palaeographer must know how to interpret them. Knowledge of individual [[Letterform|letter-forms]], [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]], [[punctuation]], and [[abbreviation]]s enables the palaeographer to read and understand the text. The palaeographer must know, first, the language of the text (that is, one must become expert in the relevant earlier forms of these languages); and second, the historical usages of various styles of handwriting, common writing customs, and scribal or [[notary|notarial]] abbreviations. [[Philology|Philological knowledge]] of the language, vocabulary, and grammar generally used at a given time or place can help palaeographers identify ancient or more recent [[forgeries]] versus authentic documents.

Knowledge of [[writing material]]s is also essential to the study of handwriting and to the identification of the periods in which a document or manuscript may have been produced.&lt;ref name=fn_3&gt;Robert P. Gwinn, "Paleography" in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], [[Micropædia]], Vol. IX, 1986, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; An important goal may be to assign the text a date and a place of origin: this is why the palaeographer must take into account the style and formation of the manuscript and the handwriting used in it.&lt;ref name=fn_4&gt;Fernando De Lasala, ''Exercise of Latin Paleography'' ([[Pontifical Gregorian University|Gregorian University of Rome]], 2006) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Document dating ===
Palaeography can be used to provide information about the date at which a document was written. However, "paleography is a last resort for dating" and, "for book hands, a period of 50 years is the least acceptable spread of time"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Eric G. |year=1987 |title=Greek Manuscripts of the Ancient World |edition=2nd |place=London |publisher=Institute of Classical Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nongbri24"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.uncw.edu/zervosg/papyrology/nongbri%20p52%20misuse.pdf |last=Nongbri |first=Brent |year=2005 |title=The Use and Abuse of P52: Papyrological Pitfalls in the Dating of the Fourth Gospel |journal=Harvard Theological Review |volume=98 |pages=23–48 (24) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216200012/http://people.uncw.edu/zervosg/papyrology/nongbri%20p52%20misuse.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with it being suggested that "the 'rule of thumb' should probably be to avoid dating a hand more precisely than a range of at least seventy or eighty years".&lt;ref name="nongbri24" /&gt; In a 2005 e-mail addendum to his 1996 "The Paleographical Dating of P-46" paper Bruce W.

== Aramaic palaeography ==
[[File:Mandaic Alphabet.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Table showing the [[Mandaic alphabet]] (Abagada) with some of the mysteries represented by the letters]]

The [[Aramaic language]] was the international trade language of the [[Ancient Middle East]], originating in what is modern-day [[Syria]], between 1000 and 600&amp;nbsp;BC. It spread from the [[Mediterranean coast]] to the borders of [[India]], becoming extremely popular and being adopted by many people, both with or without any previous writing system. The [[Aramaic script]] was written in a [[Abjad|consonantal form]] with a direction from right to left. The [[Aramaic alphabet]], a modified form of [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], was the ancestor of the [[Arabic alphabet|modern Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script]]s, as well as the [[Brāhmī script]], the parent writing system of most modern [[abugida]]s in [[India]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Tibet]], and [[Mongolia]]. Initially, the Aramaic script did not differ from the Phoenician, but then the [[Aramaeans]] simplified some of the letters, thickened and rounded their lines: a specific feature of its letters is the distinction between '''d''' and '''r'''. One innovation in Aramaic is the ''[[matres lectionis]]'' system to indicate certain vowels. Early Phoenician-derived scripts did not have letters for vowels, and so most texts recorded just consonants. Most likely as a consequence of phonetic changes in North Semitic languages, the Aramaeans reused certain letters in the alphabet to represent long vowels. The letter ''[[aleph]]'' was employed to write /'''ā'''/, ''he'' for /'''ō'''/, ''yod'' for /'''ī'''/, and ''vav'' for /'''ū'''/.

Aramaic writing and language supplanted [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]] [[cuneiform]] and [[Akkadian language]], even in their homeland in [[Mesopotamia]]. The wide diffusion of Aramaic letters led to its writing being used not only in monumental inscriptions, but also on [[papyrus]] and [[potsherds]]. Aramaic papyri have been found in large numbers in Egypt, especially at [[Elephantine papyri|Elephantine]]—among them are official and private documents of the [[Jewish military history|Jewish military settlement]] in 5&amp;nbsp;BC. In the Aramaic papyri and potsherds, words are separated usually by a small gap, as in modern writing. At the turn of the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC, the heretofore uniform Aramaic letters developed new forms, as a result of dialectal and political fragmentation in several subgroups. The most important of these is the so-called [[Hebrew square script|square Hebrew block script]], followed by [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]], [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]], and the much later [[Syriac script]].

Aramaic is usually divided into three main parts:&lt;ref name="Bey" /&gt;
# Old Aramaic (in turn subdivided into Ancient, Imperial, Old Eastern and Old Western Aramaic)
# Middle Aramaic, and
# Modern Aramaic of the present day.

The term Middle Aramaic refers to the form of Aramaic which appears in pointed texts and is reached in the 3rd century AD with the loss of short unstressed vowels in open syllables, and continues until the triumph of [[Arabic]].

Old Aramaic appeared in the 11th century BC as the official language of the first [[Syro-Hittite states|Aramaean states]]. The oldest witnesses to it are inscriptions from northern [[Syria]] of the 10th to 8th centuries BC, especially extensive state treaties (c. 750 BC) and royal inscriptions. The early Old Ancient should be classified as "Ancient Aramaic" and consists of two clearly distinguished and standardised written languages, the Early Ancient Aramaic and the Late Ancient Aramaic. Aramaic was influenced at first principally by [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], then from the 5th century BC by [[Persian language|Persian]] and from the 3rd century BC onwards by [[Greek language|Greek]], as well as by [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], especially in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Bey"&gt;Cf. Klaus Beyer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pZ53zpMQNLEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Aramaic Language''], Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1986, pp. 9- 15; Rainer Degen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nrRcQwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Altaramäische Grammatik der Inschriften des 10-8 Jh.v.Chr.''], [[Wiesbaden]], repr. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; As Aramaic evolved into the imperial language of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], the script used to write it underwent a change into something more cursive. The best examples of this script come from documents written on papyrus from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;This script was also used during the reign of King [[Ashoka]] in his edicts to spread early [[Buddhism]]. Cf. [http://www.ancientscripts.com/aramaic.html "Ancient Scripts: Aramaic"]. Accessed 05/04/2013&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 BC, [[Darius I]] (522–486) made the Aramaic used by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid imperial administration]] into the official language of the western half of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. This so-called "Imperial Aramaic" (the oldest dated example, from Egypt, belonging to 495 BC) is based on an otherwise unknown written form of Ancient Aramaic from [[Babylonia]]. In orthography, Imperial Aramaic preserves historical forms—[[alphabet]], [[orthography]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[pronunciation]], [[vocabulary]], [[syntax]] and [[Style (sociolinguistics)|style]] are highly standardised. Only the formularies of the private documents and the [[Ahiqar|Proverbs of Ahiqar]] have maintained an older tradition of sentence structure and style. Imperial Aramaic immediately replaced Ancient Aramaic as a written language and, with slight modifications, it remained the official, commercial and literary language of the [[Near East]] until gradually, beginning with the fall of the Persian Empire (331 BC) and ending in the 4th century AD, it was replaced by Greek, Persian, the eastern and western dialects of Aramaic and Arabic, though not without leaving its traces in the written form of most of these. In its original Achaemenid form, Imperial Aramaic is found in texts of the 5th to 3rd centuries BC. These come mostly from Egypt and especially from the [[Jewish temple at Elephantine#Jewish temple at Elephantine|Jewish military colony]] of [[Elephantine]], which existed at least from 530 to 399 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

== Greek palaeography ==
{{See also|History of the Greek alphabet}}

A history of Greek handwriting must be incomplete owing to the fragmentary nature of evidence. If one rules out the inscriptions on stone or metal, which belong to the science of {{small caps|[[epigraphy]]}}, we are practically dependent for the period preceding the 4th or 5th century AD on the [[papyri]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (cf. {{small caps|[[papyrology]]}}), the earliest of which take back our knowledge only to the end of the 4th century BC. This limitation is less serious than might appear, since the few [[manuscript]]s not of Egyptian origin which have survived from this period, like the parchments from [[Avroman]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. E. H. Minns, ''Journ. of Hell. Stud.'', xxxv, pp.22ff.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Dura, Hebron|Dura]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''New Pal. Soc.'', ii, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Herculaneum papyri]], and a few documents found in Egypt but written elsewhere, reveal a uniformity of style in the various portions of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek world]]; but some differences can be discerned, and it is probable that, were there more material, distinct local styles could be traced.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;In creating and expanding the following sections on {{small caps|Greek palaeography}}—inclusive of the "Vellum and Paper Manuscripts" subsection—specialist sources have been consulted and thoroughly perused for the relevant text and citations, as follows: primarily the article on ''general palaeography'' by renowned [[United Kingdom|British]] [[papyrology|papyrologist]] and scholar Sir [[Harold Idris Bell]], present in  {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Palaeography#Greek Writing I|display=Palaeography § Greek Writing}} |volume=20 |pages=557–567}}&lt;!--|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri20chis#page/557/mode/1up--&gt; – now in the [[public domain]]; [[Barry B.

These texts will be referred to throughout the present article with relevant inline citations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, any given period several types of hand may exist together. There was a marked difference between the hand used for literary works (generally called "[[uncials]]" but, in the [[papyrus]] period, better styled "book-hand") and that of documents ("[[cursive]]") and within each of these classes several distinct styles were employed side by side; and the various types are not equally well represented in the surviving papyri.

The development of any hand is largely influenced by the materials used. To this general rule the Greek script is no exception. Whatever may have been the period at which the use of papyrus or leather as a writing material began in Greece (and papyrus was employed in the 5th century BC), it is highly probable that for some time after the introduction of the [[alphabet]] the characters were incised with a sharp tool on stones or metal far oftener than they were written with a pen. In cutting a hard surface, it is easier to form angles than curves; in writing the reverse is the case; hence the development of writing was from angular letters ("capitals") inherited from [[epigraphy|epigraphic style]] to rounded ones ("uncials"). But only certain letters were affected by this development, in particular '''E''' (uncial '''ε'''), '''Σ''' ('''c'''), '''Ω''' ('''ω'''), and to a lesser extent '''A''' ('''α''').

=== Ptolemaic period ===
[[File:P.Berol. inv. 9875 col. v coronis.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the [[Berlin]] papyrus 9875 showing the 5th column of [[Timotheus of Miletus|Timotheus']] ''Persae'', with a [[Coronis (textual symbol)|coronis]] symbol to mark the end.]]

The earliest Greek papyrus yet discovered is probably that containing the ''Persae'' of [[Timotheus of Miletus|Timotheus]], which dates from the second half of the 4th century BC and its script has a curiously archaic appearance. '''E''', '''Σ''', and '''Ω''' have the capital form, and apart from these test letters the general effect is one of stiffness and angularity.&lt;ref&gt;Fragments of Timotheus' poetry survive, published in T. Bergk, ''Poetae lyrici graeci''. The cit. papyrus-fragment of his ''Persae (Persians)'' was discovered at [[Abusir]] and has been edited by [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], ''Der Timotheos-Papyrus gefunden bei Abusir am 1. Februar 1902'', Leipzig: Hinrichs (1903), with content discussion. Cf. V. Strazzulla, ''Persiani di Eschilo ed il nomo di Timoteo'' (1904); S. Sudhaus in ''Rhein. Mus.'', iviii. (1903), p. 481; and T. Reinach and M. Croiset in ''Revue des etudes grecques'', xvi. (1903), pp. 62, 323.&lt;/ref&gt; More striking is the hand of the earliest dated papyrus, a contract of 311 BC. Written with more ease and elegance, it shows little trace of any development towards a truly [[cursive]] style; the letters are not linked, and though the uncial '''c''' is used throughout, '''E''' and '''Ω''' have the capital forms. A similar impression is made by the few other papyri, chiefly literary, dating from about 300 BC; '''E''' may be slightly rounded, '''Ω''' approach the uncial form, and the angular '''Σ''' occurs as a letter only in the Timotheus papyrus, though it survived longer as a numeral (= 200), but the hands hardly suggest that for at least a century and a half the art of writing on papyrus had been well established. Yet before the middle of the 3rd century BC, one finds both a practised book-hand and a developed and often remarkably handsome cursive.

These facts may be due to accident, the few early papyri happening to represent an archaic style which had survived along with a more advanced one; but it is likely that there was a rapid development at this period, due partly to the opening of Egypt, with its supplies of papyri, and still more to the establishment of the great [[Alexandrian Library]], which systematically copied literary and scientific works, and to the multifarious activities of [[Hellenistic]] bureaucracy. From here onward, the two types of script were sufficiently distinct (though each influenced the other) to require separate treatment. Some literary papyri, like the roll containing [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of Athens]]'', were written in cursive hands, and, conversely, the book-hand was occasionally used for documents. Since the scribe did not date literary rolls, such papyri are useful in tracing the development of the book-hand.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

The documents of the mid-3rd century BC show a great variety of [[cursive]] hands. There are none from chancelleries of the Hellenistic monarchs, but some letters, notably those of [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]], the finance minister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]], to this agent, Zeno, and those of the Palestianian sheikh, Toubias, are in a type of script which cannot be very unlike the [[Chancery hand]] of the time, and show the Ptolemaic cursive at its best. These hands have a noble spaciousness and strength, and though the individual letters are by no means uniform in size there is a real unity of style, the general impression being one of breadth and uprightness. '''H''', with the cross-stroke high, '''Π''', '''Μ''', with the middle stroke reduced to a very shallow curve, sometimes approaching a horizontal line, '''Υ''', and '''Τ''', with its cross-bar extending much further to the left than to the right of the up-stroke, '''Γ''' and '''Ν''', whose last stroke is prolonged upwards above the line, often curving backwards, are all broad; '''ε''', '''c''', '''θ''' and '''β''', which sometimes takes the form of two almost perpendicular strokes joined only at the top, are usually small; '''ω''' is rather flat, its second loop reduced to a practically straight line. Partly by the broad flat tops of the larger letters, partly by the insertion of a stroke connecting those (like H, Υ) which are not naturally adapted to linking, the scribes produced the effect of a horizontal line along the top of the writing, from which the letters seem to hang. This feature is indeed a general characteristic of the more formal Ptolemaic script, but it is specially marked in the 3rd century BC.

[[File:The Derveni Papyrus.jpg|thumb|The [[Derveni Papyrus]], a Greek Macedonian philosophical text dating around 340 BC, considered Europe's oldest manuscript]]

Besides these hand of Chancery type, there are numerous less elaborate examples of cursive, varying according to the writer's skill and degree of education, and many of them strikingly easy and handsome.{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} In some cursiveness is carried very far, the linking of letters reaching the point of illegibility, and the characters sloping to the right. '''A''' is reduced to a mere acute angle (&lt;big&gt;'''∠'''&lt;/big&gt;), '''T''' has the cross-stroke only on the left, '''ω''' becomes an almost straight line, '''H''' acquires a shape somewhat like &lt;big&gt;h&lt;/big&gt;, and the last stroke of '''N''' is extended far upwards and at times flattened out until it is little more than a diagonal stroke to the right. The attempt to secure a horizontal line along the top is here abandoned. This style was not due to inexpertness, but to the desire for speed, being used especially in accounts and drafts, and was generally the work of practised writers. How well established the cursive hand had now become is shown in some wax tablets of this period, the writing on which, despite the difference of material, closely resemble the hands of papyri.&lt;ref&gt;Wax tablets of this period are preserved at the [[University College London]], cf. ''Speaking in the Wax Tablets of Memory'', Agocs, PA (2013). In: Castagnoli, L. and Ceccarelli, P, (eds.), Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents of the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries BC show, perhaps partly by the accident of survival (there is nothing analogous to the Apollonius letters, a loss of breadth and spaciousness. In the more formal types the letters stand rather stiffly upright, often without the linking strokes, and are more uniform in size; in the more cursive they are apt to be packed closely together. These features are more marked in the hands of the 2nd century. The less cursive often show am approximation to the book-hand, the letters growing rounder and less angular than in the 3rd century; in the more cursive linking was carried further, both by the insertion of coupling strokes and by the writing of several letters continuously without raising the pen, so that before the end of the century an almost current hand was evolved. A characteristic letter, which survived into the early Roman period, is '''T''', with its cross-stroke made in two portions (variants:[[File:Greek cursive variants Tau.svg|70px]]). In the 1st century, the hand tended, so far as can be inferred from surviving examples, to disintegrate; one can recognise the signs which portend a change of style, irregularity, want of direction, and the loss of the feeling for style. A fortunate accident has preserved two Greek [[parchment]]s written in [[Parthia]], one dated 88 BC, in a practically unligatured hand, the other, 22/21 BC, in a very cursive script of Ptolemaic type; and though each has non-Egyptian features the general character indicates a uniformity of style in the Hellenistic world.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

The development of the Ptolemaic book-hand is difficult to trace, as there are few examples, mostly not datable on external grounds. Only for the 3rd century BC have we a secure basis. The hands of that period have an angular appearance; there is little uniformity in the size of individual letters, and though sometimes, notably in the [[Flinders Petrie|Petrie papyrus]] containing the ''[[Phaedo]]'' of [[Plato]], a style of considerable delicacy is attained, the book-hand in general shows less mastery than the contemporary cursive. In the 2nd century the letters grew rounder and more uniform in size, but in the 1st century there is perceptible, here as in the cursive hand, a certain disintegration. Probably at no time did the Ptolemaic book-hand acquire such unity of stylistic effect as the cursive.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Lewis Campbell, "On the Text of the Papyrus Fragment of the Phaedo", ''Classical Review'', Volume 5, Issue 10, December 1891, pp. 454–457, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3766440 published online: 27 October 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman period ===
[[File:HARRIS HOMER - 1st CENTURY B.C..JPG|thumb|left|Greek papyrus with [[Homer]]'s verses, 1st century BC]]

Papyri of the Roman period are far more numerous and show greater variety. The cursive of the 1st century has a rather broken appearance, part of one character being often made separately from the rest and linked to the next letter. A form characteristic of the 1st and 2nd century and surviving after that only as a fraction sign (=&lt;big&gt;⅛&lt;/big&gt;) is '''η''' in the shape [[File:Hand 2 sample q.png|20px]]. By the end of the 1st century, there had been developed several excellent types of cursive, which, though differing considerably both in the forms of individual letters and in general appearance, bear a family likeness to one another. Qualities which are specially noticeable are roundness in the shape of letters, continuity of formation, the pen being carried on from character to character, and regularity, the letters not differing strikingly in size and projecting strokes above or below the line being avoided. Sometimes, especially in tax-receipts and in stereotyped formulae, cursiveness is carried to an extreme. In a letter of the prefect, dated in 209, we have a fine example of the [[Chancery hand]], with tall and laterally compressed letters, '''ο''' very narrow and '''α''' and '''ω''' often written high in the line. This style, from at least the latter part of the 2nd century, exercised considerable influence on the local hands, many of which show the same characteristics less pronounced; and its effects may be traced into the early part of the 4th century. Hands of the 3rd century uninfluenced by it show a falling off from the perfection of the 2nd century; stylistic uncertainty and a growing coarseness of execution mark a period of decline and transition.

[[File:Herculanean Rolls - Papyrus 157-152.JPG|thumb|Copy of Herculanean Rolls, Greek papyrus 157–152]]

Several different types of book-hand were used in the Roman period. Particularly handsome{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} is a round, upright hand seen, for example, in a [[British Museum]] papyrus containing ''[[Odyssey]]'' III. The cross-stroke of '''ε''' is high, '''Μ''' deeply curved and '''Α''' has the form '''α'''. Uniformity of size is well attained, and a few strokes project, and these but slightly, above or below the line. Another type, well called by palaeographer Schubart the "severe" style, has a more angular appearance and not infrequently slopes to the right; though handsome, it has not the sumptuous appearance of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wilhelm Schubart, ''Griechische Palaeographie'', C.H. Beck, 1925, vol. i, pt. 4; also 1st half of new ed. of Muller's ''Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft''; and Schubart's ''Das Buch bei den Griechen und Römern'' (2nd ed.); ''ibid.'', ''Papyri Graecae Berolinenses'' (Boon, 1921).&lt;/ref&gt; There are various classes of a less pretentious style, in which convenience rather than beauty was the first consideration and no pains were taken to avoid irregularities in the shape and alignment of the letters. Lastly may be mentioned a hand which is of great interest as being the ancestor of the type called (from its later occurrence in [[vellum]] codices of the [[Bible]]) the biblical hand. This, which can be traced back at least the late 2nd century, has a square, rather heavy appearance; the letters, of uniform size, stand upright, and thick and thin strokes are well distinguished. In the 3rd century the book-hand, like the cursive, appears to have deteriorated in regularity and stylistic accomplishment.

In the charred rolls found at [[Herculaneum]] and dating from about the beginning of our era, are specimens of Greek literary hands from outside Egypt; and a comparison with the Egyptian papyri reveals great similarity in style and shows that conclusions drawn from the henads of Egypt may, with caution, be applied to the development of writing in the Greek world generally.

=== Byzantine period ===
{{See also|Byzantine text-type}}
[[File:Codex Alexandrinus 1 Tim 3,16.jpg|thumb|left|Section of the [[Codex Alexandrinus]], the oldest Greek witness of the Byzantine text in the [[Gospels]].]]
The cursive hand of the 4th century shows some uncertainty of character. Side by side with the style founded on the [[Chancery hand]], regular in formation and with tall and narrow letters, which characterised the period of [[Diocletian]], and lasted well into the century, we find many other types mostly marked by a certain looseness and irregularity. A general progress towards a florid and sprawling hand is easily recognisable, but a consistent and deliberate style was hardly evolved before the 5th century, from which unfortunately few dated documents have survived. [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine]] cursive tends to an exuberant hand, in which the long strokes are excessively extended and individual letters often much enlarged. But not a few hands of the 5th and 6th centuries are truly handsome and show considerable technical accomplishment. Both an upright and a sloping type occur and there are many less ornamental hands, but there gradually emerged towards the 7th century two general types, one (especially used in letters and contracts) a current hand, sloping to the right, with long strokes in such characters at '''τ''', '''ρ''', '''ξ''', '''η''' (which has the &lt;big&gt;h&lt;/big&gt; shape), '''ι''', and '''κ''', and with much linking of letters, and another (frequent in accounts), which shows, at least in essence, most of the forms of the later minuscule. (cf. [[#Minuscule Hand|below]].) This is often upright, though a slope to the right is quite common, and sometimes, especially in one or two documents of the early [[Arabic alphabet|Arab]] period, it has an almost [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] effect.

In the Byzantine period, the book-hand, which in earlier times had more than once approximated to the contemporary cursive, diverged widely from it.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

=== Vellum and paper manuscripts ===
The change from papyrus to [[vellum]] involved no such modification in the forms of letters as followed that from metal to papyrus. The justification for considering the two materials separately is that after the general adoption of vellum, the Egyptian evidence is first supplemented and later superseded by that of [[manuscript]]s from elsewhere, and that during this period the hand most used was one not previously employed for literary purposes.

==== Uncial hand ====
{{See also|Uncial script}}
{{double image|right|Codex Vaticanus B, 2Thess. 3,11-18, Hebr. 1,1-2,2.jpg|160|Codex Marchalianus Pg 71.JPG|160|Pages from [[Codex Vaticanus]] (left) and [[Codex Marchalianus]] (right)}}

The prevailing type of book-hand during what in [[papyrology]] is called the Byzantine period, that is, roughly from AD 300 to 650, is known as the biblical hand. It went back to at least the end of the 2nd century and had had originally no special connection with [[Christian literature]]. In [[manuscript]]s, whether vellum or paper, of the 4th century found in Egypt are met other forms of script, particularly a sloping, rather inelegant hand derived from the literary hand of the 3rd century, which persisted to at least the 5th century; but the three great early codices of the Bible are all written in uncials of the biblical type. In the [[Codex Vaticanus|Vaticanus]], placed in the 4th century, the characteristics of the hand are least strongly marked; the letters have the forms characteristic of the type but without the heavy appearance of later manuscripts, and the general impression is one of greater roundness. In the [[Sinaiticus]], which is not much later, the letters are larger and more heavily made; and in the [[Alexandrinus]] (5th century) a later development is seen, with emphatic distinction of thick and thin strokes. By the 6th century, alike in vellum and in papyrus manuscripts, the heaviness had become very marked, though the hand still retained, in its best examples, a handsome appearance; but after this it steadily deteriorated, becoming ever more mechanical and artificial. The thick strokes grew heavier; the cross strokes of '''T''' and '''Θ''' and the base of '''Δ''' were furnished with drooping spurs. The hand, which is often singularly ugly, passed through various modifications, now sloping, now upright, though it is not certain that these variations were really successive rather than concurrent. A different type of uncials, derived from the [[Chancery hand]] and seen in two papyrus examples of the Festal letters despatched annually by the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], was occasionally used, the best known example being the [[Codex Marchalianus]] (6th or 7th century). A combination of this hand with the other type is also known.

==== Minuscule hand ====
The uncial hand lingered on, mainly for liturgical manuscripts, where a large and easily legible script was serviceable, as late as the 12th century, but in ordinary use it had long been superseded by a new type of hand, the [[Greek minuscule|minuscule]], which originated in the 8th century, as an adaptation to literary purposes of the second of the types of Byzantine cursive mentioned above. A first attempt at a calligraphic use of this hand, seen in one or two manuscripts of the 8th or early 9th century,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. P.F. de' Cavalieri &amp; J. Lietzmann, ''Specimina Codicum Graecorum Vaticanorum'' No. 5, Bonn, 1910; G. Vitelli &amp; C. Paoli, ''Collezione fiorentina di facsimili paleografici'', Florence (rist. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; in which it slopes to the right and has a narrow, angular appearance, did not find favour, but by the end of the 9th century a more ornamental type, from which modern Greek script descended, was already established. It has been suggested that it was evolved in the [[Monastery of Stoudios]] at [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. T.W. Allen, "Notes on Abbreviations in Greek Manuscripts", ''Joun. Hell. Stud.'', xl, pp. 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest examples it is upright and exact but lacks flexibility; accents are small, [[Greek diacritics|breathings]] square in formation, and in general only such [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]] are used as involve no change in the shape of letters. The single forms have a general resemblance (with considerable differences in detail) both to the minuscule cursive of late papyri, and to those used in modern Greek type; uncial forms were avoided.

In the course of the 10th century the hand, without losing its beauty and exactness, gained in freedom. Its finest period was from the 9th to the 12th century,{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} after which it rapidly declined. The development was marked by a tendency
# to the intrusion, in growing quantity, of uncial forms which good scribes could fit into the line without disturbing the unity of style but which, in less expert hands, had a disintegrating effect;
# to the disproportionate enlargement of single letters, especially at the beginnings and ends of lines;
# to ligatures, often very fantastic, which quite changed the forms of letters;
# to the enlargement of accents, breathings at the same time acquiring the modern rounded form.
But from the first there were several styles, varying from the formal, regular hands characteristic of service books to the informal style, marked by numerous abbreviations, used in manuscripts intended only for a scholar's private use. The more formal hands were exceedingly conservative, and there are few classes of script more difficult to date than the Greek minuscule of this class. In the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries a sloping hand, less dignified than the upright, formal type, but often very handsome, was especially used for manuscripts of the classics.

Hands of the 11th century are marked in general (though there are exceptions) by a certain grace and delicacy, exact but easy; those of the 12th by a broad, bold sweep and an increasing freedom, which readily admits uncial forms, ligatures and enlarged letters but has not lost the sense of style and decorative effect. In the 13th and still more in the 14th centuries there was a steady decline; the less formal hands lost their beauty and exactness, becoming ever more disorderly and chaotic in their effect, while formal style imitated the precision of an earlier period without attaining its freedom and naturalness, and often appears singularly lifeless. In the 15th century, especially in the West, where Greek scribes were in request to produce manuscripts of the classical authors, there was a revival, and several manuscripts of this period, though markedly inferior to those of the 11th and 12th centuries, are by no means without beauty.

=== Accents, punctuation, and division of words ===
[[File:Paragraphos.png|thumb|Variants of [[paragraphos]]]]
{{See also|Punctuation}}
In the book-hand of early papyri, neither accents nor breathings were employed. Their use was established by the beginning of the Roman period, but was sporadic in papyri, where they were used as an aid to understanding, and therefore more frequently in poetry than prose, and in lyrical oftener than in other verse. In the cursive of papyri they are practically unknown, as are marks of punctuation. Punctuation was effected in early papyri, literary and documentary, by spaces, reinforced in the book-hand by the [[paragraphos]], a horizontal stroke under the beginning of the line. The [[Coronis (textual symbol)|coronis]], a more elaborate form of this, marked the beginning of lyrics or the principal sections of a longer work. Punctuation marks, the [[comma]], the high, low and middle points, were established in the book-hand by the Roman period; in early Ptolemaic papyri, a double point (''':''') is found.

In vellum and paper manuscripts, punctuation marks and accents were regularly used from at least the 8th century, though with some differences from modern practice. At no period down to the invention of printing did Greek scribes consistently separate words. The book-hand of papyri aimed at an unbroken succession of letters, except for distinction of sections; in cursive hands, especially where abbreviations were numerous, some tendency to separate words may be recognised, but in reality it was phrases or groups of letters rather than words which were divided. In the later minuscule word-division is much commoner but never became systematic, accents and breathings serving of themselves to indicate the proper division.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;

{{See also|Linguistic history of the Indian subcontinent}}
The view that the art of writing in [[India]] developed gradually, as in other areas of the world, by going through the stages of pictographic, ideographic and transitional phases of the phonetic script, which in turn developed into syllabic and alphabetic scripts was challenged by Falk and others in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schrift im alten Indien: ein Forschungsbericht mit Anmerkungen|first=Harry|last=Falk|date=1993|publisher=G. Narr|isbn=3823342711|location=Tübingen|oclc=29443654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the new paradigm, Indian alphabetic writing, called [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī]], was discontinuous with earlier, undeciphered, glyphs, and was invented specifically by King [[Ashoka]] for application in his royal [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts]]. In the subcontinent, three scripts like Indus, [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]] and [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī]] became prevalent. In addition, [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Arabic script]]s were also added to the Indian context after their penetration in the early centuries of the [[common era]] (CE). The decipherment and subsequent development of Indus glyphs is also a matter for continuing research and discussion. After a lapse of a few centuries the Kharoṣṭhī script became obsolete; the Greek script in India went through a similar fate and disappeared. But the Brāhmī and Arabic scripts endured for a much longer period. Moreover, there was a change and development in the Brāhmī script which may be traced in time and space through the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]], [[Kushan Empire|Kuṣāṇa]], [[Gupta script|Gupta]] and early medieval periods. The present day [[Nāgarī script]] is derived from Brāhmī. The Brāhmī is also the ancestral script of many other Indian scripts, in northern and southern South Asia. Legends and inscriptions in Brāhmī are engraved upon leather, wood, terracotta, ivory, stone, copper, bronze, silver and gold. Arabic got an important place, particularly in the royalty, during the medieval period and it provides rich material for history writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salomon|first=Richard|date=1995|title=Review: On the Origin of the Early Indian Scripts|jstor=604670|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=115|issue=2|pages=271–279|doi=10.2307/604670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the available inscriptions and manuscripts written in the above scripts—in languages like [[Prakrit|Prākrita]], [[Pali|Pāḷi]], [[Sanskrit|Saṃskṛta]], [[Apabhraṃśa]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]—have been read and exploited for history writing, but numerous inscriptions preserved in different museums still remain undeciphered for lack of competent palaeographic Indologists, as there is a gradual decline in the subcontinent of such disciplines as palaeography, [[epigraphy]] and [[numismatics]]. The discipline of ancient Indian scripts and the languages they are written needs new scholars who, by adopting traditional palaeographic methods and modern technology, may decipher, study and transcribe the various types of epigraphs and legends still extant today.&lt;ref&gt;There are few available texts relating to "Indian palaeography", among which Ahmad Hasan Dani, ''Indian Palaeography'', Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 1997; A. C. Burnell, ''Elements of South-Indian Palaeography, from the Fourth to the Seventeenth Century AD'', repr. 2012; Rajbali Pandey, ''Indian Palaeography'', Motilal Banarasi Das, 1957; Naresh Prasad Rastogi, ''Origin of Brāhmī Script: The Beginning of Alphabet in India'', Chowkhamba Saraswatibhawan, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian epigraphy: a guide to the study of inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan languages|last=Salomon|first=Richard|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195099842|location=New York|oclc=252595337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language of the earliest written records, that is, the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], is [[Prakrit]]. Besides Prakrit, the Ashokan edicts are also written in Greek and Aramaic. Moreover, all the edicts of [[Ashoka]] engraved in the Kharoshthi and Brahmi scripts are in the Prakrit language: thus, originally the language employed in the inscriptions was Prakrit, with Sanskrit adopted at a later stage. Past the period of the [[Maurya Empire]], the use of Prakrit continued in inscriptions for a few more centuries. In north India, Prakrit was replaced by Sanskrit by the end of the 3rd century, while this change took place about a century later in south India. Some of the inscriptions though written in Prakrit, were influenced by Sanskrit and vice versa. The epigraphs of the Kushana kings are found in a mixture of Prakrit and Sanskrit, while the Mathura inscriptions of the time of Sodasa, belonging to the first quarter of the 1st century, contain verses in classical Sanskrit. From the 4th century onwards, the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]] came to power and made Sanskrit flourish by supporting it in language and literature.

In western India and also in some regions of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]], Prakrit was used till the 4th century, mostly in the [[Buddhist]] writings though in a few contemporary records of the [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvakus]] of [[Nagarjunakonda]], Sanskrit was applied. The inscription of [[Yajna Sri Satakarni]] (2nd century) from [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] is considered to be the earliest so far. The earlier writings (4th century) of Salankayanas of the [[Telugu people|Telugu region]] are in Prakrit, while their later records (belonging to the 5th century) are written in Sanskrit. In the [[Kannada language|Kannada speaking area]], inscriptions belonging to later Satavahanas and Chutus were written in Prakrit. From the 4th century onwards, with the rise of the Guptas, Sanskrit became the predominant language of India and continued to be employed in texts and inscriptions of all parts of India along with the regional languages in the subsequent centuries. The copper-plate charters of the [[Pallavas]], the [[Cholas]] and the [[Pandyas]] documents are written in both Sanskrit and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Kannada is used in texts dating from about the 5th century and the [[Halmidi inscription]] is considered to be the earliest [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] written in the [[Kannada language]]. Inscriptions in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] began to appear from the 6th or 7th century. [[Malayalam]] made its beginning in writings from the 15th century onwards.&lt;ref name="Indi"&gt;For this section cf.

=== North India ===
[[File:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|[[Rigveda]] manuscript in [[Devanāgarī]] (early 19th century)]]
{{See also|Kharosthi|Devanagari}}
In north India, the [[Brahmi]] script was used over a vast area; however, [[Ashoka]]n inscriptions are also found using [[Kharoshthi]], [[Aramaic]] and [[Greek script]]s. With the advent of the [[Saka]]-[[Western Kshatrapas|Kshatrapas]] and the [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]] as political powers in north India, the writing system underwent a definite change due to the use of new writing tools and techniques. Further development of the Brahmi script and perceivable changes in its evolutionary trend can be discerned during the Gupta period: in fact, the [[Gupta script]] is considered to be the successor of the Kushana script in north India.

From the 6th to about the 10th century of the [[common era]], the inscriptions in north India were written in a script variously named, e.g., Siddhamatrika and Kutila ("Rañjanā script"). From the 8th century, Siddhamatrika developed into the [[Śāradā script]] in [[Kashmir]] and [[Punjab region|Punjab]], into [[Bengali language|Proto-Bengali]] or Gaudi in [[Bengal]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], and into [[Devanagari|Nagari]] in other parts of north India. [[Nāgarī script]] was used widely in northern India from the 10th century onwards. The use of [[Nandinagari]], a variant of [[Nagari script]], is mostly confined to the [[Karnataka]] region.

In central India, mostly in [[Madhya Pradesh]], the inscriptions of the [[Vakatakas]], and the kings of [[Sharabhapuriya dynasty|Sarabhapura]] and [[Dakshina Kosala|Kosala]] were written in what are known as "box-headed" and "nail-headed" characters. It may be noted that the early [[Kadambas]] of [[Karnataka]] also employed "nail-headed" characters in some of their inscriptions. During the 3rd–4th century, the script used in the inscriptions of [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Ikshvakus]] of [[Nagarjunakonda]] developed a unique style of letter-forms with elongated verticals and artistic flourishes, which did not continue after their rule.&lt;ref name="Indi" /&gt;

=== South India ===
The earliest attested form of writing in [[South India]] is represented by inscriptions found in caves, associated with the [[Chalukya]] and [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]] dynasties. These are written in variants of what is known as the [[Cave character]], and their script differs from the Northern version in being more angular. Most of the modern scripts of South India have evolved from this script, with the exception of [[Vatteluttu]], the exact origins of which are unknown, and [[Nandinagari]], which is a variant of [[Devanagari]] that developed due to later Northern influence. In south India from the 7th century of the common era onwards, a number of inscriptions belonging to the dynasties of Pallava, Chola and Pandya are found. These records are written in three different scripts known as [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Vattezhuttu]] and [[Grantha script]]s, the last variety being used to write Sanskrit inscriptions. In the [[Kerala]] region, the Vattezhuttu script developed into a still more cursive script called [[Kolezhuthu]] during the 14th and 15th centuries. At the same time, the modern [[Malayalam]] script developed out of the Grantha script. The early form of the [[Telugu-Kannada script]] is found in the inscriptions of the early [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadambas]] of [[Banavasi]] and the early [[Chalukyas of Badami]] in the west, and [[Salankayana]] and the early Eastern Chalukyas in the east who ruled the Kannada and Telugu speaking areas respectively, during the 4th to 7th centuries.

== Latin ==
{{See also|History of the Latin alphabet}}
Attention should be drawn at the outset to certain fundamental definitions and principles of the science. The original characters of an alphabet are modified by the material and the implements used. When stone and chisel are discarded for papyrus and reed-pen, the hand encounters less resistance and moves more rapidly. This leads to changes in the size and position of the letters, and then to the joining of letters, and, consequently, to altered shapes. We are thus confronted at an early date with quite distinct types. The majuscule style of writing, based on two parallel lines, '''ADPL''', is opposed to the minuscule, based on a system of four lines, with letters of unequal height, '''adpl'''. Another classification, according to the care taken in forming the letters, distinguishes between the set book-hand and the cursive script. The difference in this case is determined by the subject matter of the text; the writing used for books (''scriptura libraria'') is in all periods quite distinct from that used for letters and documents (''epistolaris, diplomatica''). While the set book-hand, in majuscule or minuscule, shows a tendency to stabilise the forms of the letters, the cursive, often carelessly written, is continually changing in the course of years and according to the preferences of the writers.

This being granted, a summary survey of the morphological history of the [[Latin alphabet]] shows the zenith of its modifications at once, for its history is divided into two very unequal periods, the first dominated by majuscule and the second by minuscule writing.&lt;ref name="Bouar"&gt;The contents of the following sections on {{small caps|Latin palaeography}}—especially the parts relating to "Minuscule writing"—are mainly based on the specialist writings consulted and cited throughout the text, from the following sources: primarily the article on ''Latin handwriting'' by French palaeographist A. de Bouard, present {{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Palaeography#Latin Writing I |display=Palaeography § Latin Writing |volume=20 |pages=567–573}}&lt;!--|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri20chis#page/567/mode/1up--&gt; – now in the [[public domain]]; the requisite [http://guindo.pntic.mec.es/jmag0042/ingles.php?d=LATIN_PALEOGRAPHY.pdf ''Fonts for Latin Palaeography – User's manual''], by Juan-Jose Marcos, 2011; Schiapparelli, ''La scrittura latina nell'età romana'', 1921; Giorgio Cencetti, ''Paleografia latina'', Jouvence, 2002; [[Bernhard Bischoff]], ''Paleografia latina.

=== Overview ===
[[Jean Mabillon]], a French Benedictine monk, scholar and [[Antiquarian|antiquary]], whose work ''De re diplomatica'' was published in 1681, is widely regarded as the founder of the twin disciplines of palaeography and [[diplomatics]]. However, the actual term "palaeography" was coined (in Latin) by [[Bernard de Montfaucon]], a [[Benedictine monk]], in the title of his ''Palaeographia Graeca'' (1708), which remained a standard work in the specific field of Greek palaeography for more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard de Montfaucon et al., ''Palaeographia Graeca, sive, De ortu et progressu literarum graecarum'', Paris, Ludovicum Guerin (1708).&lt;/ref&gt; With their establishment of palaeography, Mabillon and his fellow Benedictines were responding to the Jesuit [[Daniel Papebroch]], who doubted the authenticity of some of the documents which the Benedictines offered as credentials for the authorisation of their monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament'' Fourth Edition (Oxford University, 2005), p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century such scholars as [[Wilhelm Wattenbach]], [[Leopold Delisle]] and [[Ludwig Traube (palaeographer)|Ludwig Traube]] contributed greatly to making palaeography independent from diplomatic. In the 20th century, the 'New French School' of palaeographers, especially [[Jean Mallon]], gave a new direction to the study of scripts by stressing the importance of ductus (the shape and order of the strokes used to compose letters) in studying the historical development of scripts.&lt;ref name=fn_2&gt;R. Marichal, "Paleography" in New Encyclopaedia New York: Gale-Thomson, 2003 Vol. X, p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Majuscule writing ===
==== Capital writing ====
[[File:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|200px|Folio14 [[recto]] of the [[Vergilius Romanus]] written in [[rustic capitals]], also contains an author portrait of [[Virgil]].]]

The [[Latin alphabet]] first appears in the epigraphic type of [[majuscule]] writing, known as capitals. These characters form the main stem from which developed all the branches of Latin writing. On the oldest monuments (the ''inscriptiones bello Hannibalico antiquiores'' of the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum = CIL]]''), it is far from showing the orderly regularity of the later period. Side by side with upright and square characters are angular and sloping forms, sometimes very distorted, which seem to indicate the existence of an early cursive writing from which they would have been borrowed. Certain literary texts clearly allude to such a hand.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Henry B. Van Hoesen, [https://archive.org/details/romancursivewri00hoesgoog ''Roman Cursive Writing''], Princeton University Press, 1915, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the characters of the cursive type were progressively eliminated from formal inscriptions, and capital writing reached its perfection in the [[History of Rome|Augustan Age]].

Epigraphists divide the numerous inscriptions of this period into two quite distinct classes: ''tituli'', or formal inscriptions engraved on stone in elegant and regular capitals, and ''acta'', or legal texts, documents, etc., generally engraved on bronze in cramped and careless capitals. Palaeography inherits both these types. Reproduced by scribes on papyrus or parchment, the elegant characters of the inscriptions become the square capitals of the manuscripts, and the ''actuaria'', as the writing of the ''acta'' is called, becomes the [[rustic capital]].

Of the many books written in square capitals, the ''éditions de luxe'' of ancient times, only a few fragments have survived, the most famous being pages from manuscripts of [[Virgil]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Émile Chatelain]], [http://images.library.uiuc.edu/projects/classics/index.asp ''Paléographie des classiques latins''], pl. LXI-II, LXXV; ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]'', viii, 1,098.&lt;/ref&gt; The finest examples of rustic capitals, the use of which is attested by papyri of the 1st century,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Karl Zangemeister &amp; Wilhelm Wattenbach, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wuTEXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Exempla codicum Latinorum''], Koester, 1876, pl. I-II.&lt;/ref&gt; are to be found in manuscripts of Virgil&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pal. Soc., cit.'', pl. 113-117; ''Archivio paleografico italiano'', i, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Terence]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pal. Soc.'', pl. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these forms of capital writing offers any difficulty in reading, except that no space is left between the words. Their dates are still uncertain, in spite of attempts to determine them by minute observation.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Karl Franz Otto Dziatzko]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=nHM2QwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Untersuchungen über ausgewählte Kapitel des antiken Buchwesens''], BiblioBazaar, repr. 2010; E.A. Lowe, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3572504 "More Facts about our Oldest Latin Manuscripts"], in the ''Classical Quarterly'', vol. xix, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rustic capitals, more practical than the square forms, soon came into general use. This was the standard form of writing, so far as books are concerned, until the 5th century, when it was replaced by a new type, the uncial, which is discussed below.

==== Early cursive writing ====
While the set book-hand, in square or rustic capitals, was used for the copying of books, the writing of everyday life, letters and documents of all kinds, was in a cursive form, the oldest examples of which are provided by the [[graffiti]] on walls at [[Pompeii]] (''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'', iv), a series of waxen tablets, also discovered at Pompeii (''CIL'', iv, supplement), a similar series found at [[Verespatak]] in [[Transylvania]] (''CIL'', iii) and a number of papyri.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Carl Wessely]], [http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=ha001159476 ''Schrifttafeln zur älteren lateinischen Palaeographie''], Leipzig, E. Avenarius; ''Oxyrhynchus Papyri, passim''; Vincenzo Federici, ''Esempi di corsivo antico''; ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt; From a study of a number of documents which exhibit transitional forms, it appears that this cursive was originally simplified capital writing.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Franz Steffens, [http://www.paleography.unifr.ch/schrifttafeln.htm ''Lateinische Paläographie'' – digital version''], 2nd ed., pl. 3 {{de icon}}; Wessely, ''Studien'', xiv, pl. viii; ''et al.''&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution was so rapid, however, that at quite an early date the ''scriptura epistolaris'' of the Roman world can no longer be described as capitals. By the 1st century, this kind of writing began to develop the principal characteristics of two new types: the [[Uncial script|uncial]] and the [[minuscule cursive]]. With the coming into use of writing surfaces which were smooth, or offered little resistance, the unhampered haste of the writer altered the shape, size and position of the letters. In the earliest specimens of writing on wax, plaster or papyrus, there appears a tendency to represent several straight strokes by a single curve. The cursive writing thus foreshadows the specifically uncial forms. The same specimens show great inequality in the height of the letters; the main strokes are prolonged upwards ([[File:Hand 1 sample b 1.png|20px]]= '''b'''; [[File:Hand 10 sample d 2.png|20px]]= '''d''') or downwards ([[File:Hand 2 sample q.png|20px]]= '''q'''; [[File:Hand 4 sample s 2.png|15px]] = '''s'''). In this direction, the cursive tends to become a minuscule hand.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

==== Uncial writing ====
Although the characteristic forms of the uncial type appear to have their origin in the early cursive,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Edward Maunde Thompson]], [https://archive.org/details/greeklatin00thomuoft ''Handbook of Greek and Latin Palaeography''], ''s.v.''; Van Hoesen, ''The Parentage and Birthdate of the Latin Uncial'', in ''Transactions and Proceedings'' of the [[American Philological Association]], xlii.&lt;/ref&gt; the two hands are nevertheless quite distinct. The uncial is a ''libraria'', closely related to the capital writing, from which it differs only in the rounding off of the angles of certain letters, principally [[File:Hand 1 sample A mag 2.png|28px]] [[File:Uncial d.png|15px]] [[File:Uncial e.png|15px]] [[File:Hand 2 sample m 1.png|30px]]. It represents a compromise between the beauty and legibility of the capitals and the rapidity of the cursive, and is clearly an artificial product. It was certainly in existence by the latter part of the 4th century, for a number of manuscripts of that date are written in perfect uncial hands (''Exempla'', pl. XX). It presently supplanted the capitals and appears in numerous manuscripts which have survived from the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, when it was at its height.&lt;ref&gt;A list is given in Traube, ''Vorlesungen'', i, pp. 171–261, and numerous reproductions in Zangemeister &amp; Wattenbach's ''Exempla'', and in Chatelain, ''Uncialis scriptura''.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time it had become an imitative hand, in which there was generally no room for spontaneous development. It remained noticeably uniform over a long period. It is difficult therefore to date the manuscripts by palaeographical criteria alone. The most that can be done is to classify them by centuries, on the strength of tenuous data.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Chatelain, ''Unc. script., explanatio tabularum''.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest uncial writing is easily distinguished by its simple and monumental character from the later hands, which become progressively stiff and affected.

=== Minuscule cursive writing ===
[[File:Chronica archiepiscoporum Magdeburgensium 1r 25-C-4 (16764) Hs Kynžvart 91.jpg|thumb|200px|Page from the [[Magdeburg]]'s ''Chronica archiepiscoporum'']]

==== Early minuscule cursive ====
In the ancient cursive writing, from the 1st century onward, there are symptoms of transformation in the form of certain letters, the shape and proportions of which correspond more closely to the definition of minuscule writing than to that of majuscule. Rare and irregular at first, they gradually become more numerous and more constant and by degrees supplant the majuscule forms, so that in the history of the Roman cursive there is no precise boundary between the majuscule and minuscule periods.

The oldest example of minuscule cursive writing that has been discovered is a letter on papyrus, found in Egypt, dating from the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Archiv für Urkundenforschung'', iii, pl. i.&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a highly important date in the history of Latin writing, for with only one known exception, not yet adequately explained—two fragments of imperial rescripts of the 5th century&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Theodor Mommsen]], ''Fragmente zweier Kaiserrescripte'' in ''Jahrbuch des gemeinen deutschen Rechts'', vi, 398; Preisigke in ''Schriften der wissensch. Gesellsch. in Strassburg'', xxx; ''Pal. Soc., cit.'', pl. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;—the minuscule cursive was consequently the only ''scriptura epistolaris'' of the Roman world. The ensuing succession of documents&lt;ref&gt;For example, a certificate of AD 400 in Wessely, ''Studien, cit.'', xiv, pl. xiii; a letter of AD 444 in Wessely, ''Schrifttafeln, cit.'', pl. xii, No. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; show a continuous improvement in this form of writing, characterised by the boldness of the strokes and by the elimination of the last lingering majuscule forms. The [[Ravenna]] deeds of the 5th and 6th centuries&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gaetano Marini, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UBF4CR_Ax1kC&amp;redir_esc=y ''I Papiri diplomatici''], Lightning Source UK Ltd, repr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; exhibit this hand at its perfection.

At this period, the minuscule cursive made its appearance as a ''[[book hand]]'', first as marginal notes, and later for the complete books themselves. The only difference between the book-hand and that used for documents is that the principal strokes are shorter and the characters thicker. This form of the hand is usually called ''[[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]]''.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

==== National hands ====
The fall of the Empire and the establishment of the barbarians within its former boundaries did not interrupt the use of the Roman minuscule cursive hand, which was adopted by the newcomers. But for gaps of over a century in the chronological series of documents which have been preserved, it would be possible to follow the evolution of the Roman cursive into the so-called "national hands", forms of minuscule writing which flourished after the barbarian invasions in [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[England]] and [[Ireland]], and which are still known as [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]], [[Merovingian script|Merovingian]], [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]], [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Insular script|Irish]]. These names came into use at a time when the various national hands were believed to have been invented by the peoples who used them, but their connotation is merely geographical. Nevertheless, in spite of a close resemblance which betrays their common origin, these hands are specifically different, perhaps because the Roman cursive was developed by each nation in accordance with its artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Luigi Schiapparelli, ''Note paleografiche'' in ''Archivio storico italiano'', lxxiv, p. 55; also his [https://archive.org/details/lascritturalatin00schi ''La scrittura latina nell' età romana (note paleografiche)''] (with 32 facsimiles), Como, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Lombardic writing''
[[File:Origo gentis Langobardorum.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A 10th-century [[codex]] of ''Origo gentis Langobardorum'' from [[Reims]]]]
In Italy, after the close of the Roman and Byzantine periods, the writing is known as [[Lombardic capitals|Lombardic]], a generic term which comprises several local varieties. These may be classified under four principal types: two for the ''scriptura epistolaris'', the old Italian cursive and the [[pope|papal]] [[chancery hand]], or ''littera romana'', and two for the ''libraria'', the old Italian book-hand and Lombardic in the narrow sense, sometimes known as ''Beneventana'' on account of the fact that it flourished in the principality of [[Benevento]].

The oldest preserved documents written in the old Italian cursive show all the essential characteristics of the Roman cursive of the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Giuseppe Bonelli,[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEiYQAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Codice paleografico lombardo''], Hoepli, 1908; [https://archive.org/details/bullettino0102archuoft ''Archivio paleografico italiano, cit.''], i, iii, vii.&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Italy, this hand began in the 9th century to be influenced by a minuscule book-hand which developed, as will be seen later, in the time of [[Charlemagne]]; under this influence it gradually disappeared, and ceased to exist in the course of the 12th century. In southern Italy, it persisted far on into the [[later Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Michele Russi, [https://archive.org/details/paleografiaedip00russgoog ''Paleografia e diplomatica de' documenti delle Province napolitane''], Naples, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; The papal chancery hand, a variety of Lombardic peculiar to the vicinity of [[Rome]] and principally used in papal documents, is distinguished by the formation of the letters ''a, e, q, t''. It is formal in appearance at first, but is gradually simplified, under the influence of the [[Carolingian minuscule]], which finally prevailed in the [[papal bull|bulls]] of [[Honorius II]] (1124–1130). The [[notaries public]] in Rome continued to use the papal chancery hand until the beginning of the 13th century. The old Italian book-hand is simply a semi-cursive of the type already described as in use in the 6th century. The principal examples are derived from ''[[scriptoria]]'' in northern Italy, where it was displaced by the Carolingian minuscule during the 9th century.  In southern Italy, this hand persisted, developing into a [[calligraphy|calligraphic form]] of writing, and in the 10th century took on a very artistic angular appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Elias Avery Lowe, [https://archive.org/details/beneventanscript00loweuoft ''Beneventan Script''], Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1914; [[facsimile]]s in O. Piscicelli Taeggi, ''Paleografia artistica di Monte Cassino'', [[Montecassino]], 1876–83.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Exultet]]'' rolls provide the finest examples.{{According to whom|date=April 2013}} In the 9th century, it was introduced in [[Dalmatia]] by the [[Benedictine monks]] and developed there, as in [[Apulia]], on the basis of the [[archetype]], culminating in a rounded ''[[Beneventan script|Beneventana]]'' known as the ''Bari type''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Viktor Novak, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RWhzXwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Scriptura Beneventana''], [[Zagreb]], 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Merovingian''
[[File:Merov.jpg|160px|left|thumb|8th-century [[Merovingian script]].]]
The offshoot of the Roman cursive which developed in [[Gaul]] under the first dynasty of kings is called [[Merovingian script|Merovingian writing]]. It is represented by thirty-eight royal diplomas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lauer |first1=P. |last2=Samaran |first2=C. |oclc=461176420 |title=Les diplômes originaux des Mérovingiens: fac-similés phototypiques avec notices et transcriptions |location=Paris |publisher=E. Leroux |year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of private charters&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Jules Tardif, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/fac-simile-de-chartes-et-diplomes-merovingiens-et-carlovingiens-sur-papyrus-et-sur-parchemin-compris-dans-linventaire-des-monuments-historiques/oclc/12953061 ''Fac-similé de chartes et diplômes mérovingiens et carlovingiens: sur papyrus et sur parchemin compris dans l'inventaire des Monuments historiques''], Paris: J. Claye, 1866.&lt;/ref&gt; and the authenticating documents of relics.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Maurice Prou, ''Manuel de paléographie: Recueil de fac-similés d'écritures du Ve au XVIIe siècle'', Paris: A. Picard et fils, 1904, pl. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though less than a century intervenes between the Ravenna cursive and the oldest extant Merovingian document (AD 625), there is a great difference in appearance between the two writings. The facile flow of the former is replaced by a cramped style, in which the natural slope to the right gives way to an upright hand, and the letters, instead of being fully outlined, are compressed to such an extent that they modify the shape of other letters. Copyists of books used a cursive similar to that found in documents, except that the strokes are thicker, the forms more regular, and the heads and tails shorter.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bec_0373-6237_1887_num_48_1_462552 ''Album paléographique de la Société de l'École des chartes''], pl. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Merovingian cursive as used in books underwent simplification in some localities, undoubtedly through the influence of the minuscule book-hand of the period. The two principal centres of this reform were [[Luxeuil Abbey|Luxeuil]] and [[Corbie Abbey|Corbie]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Traube, ''Perrona Scottorum'' in ''Sitzungsberichte'' of the [[Munich Academy]], 1900; Liebart, ''Corbie Scriptorum'' in W.M. Lindsay's ''Palaeogr. Lat.'', i.&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Visigothic''
[[File:AlfabetoVisigodo.png|thumb|160px|left|Alphabet in [[Visigothic script]].]]
In Spain, after the Visigothic conquest, the Roman cursive gradually developed special characteristics. Some documents attributed to the 7th century display a transitional hand with straggling and rather uncouth forms.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ewald and Loewe, ''Exempla scripturae visigothicae'', pl. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctive features of Visigothic writing, the most noticeable of which is certainly the q-shaped '''g''', did not appear until later, in the book-hand. The book-hand became set at an early date. In the 8th century it appears as a sort of semi-cursive; the earliest example of certain date is [[manuscript|ms]] lxxxix in the [[Capitulary|Capitular]] [[Library]] in [[Verona]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Clark, ''Collectanea hispanica'', 63, pp. 129–130; Schiapparelli in ''Arch. stor. ital, cit.'', lxxxii, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th century the calligraphic forms become broader and more rounded until the 11th century, when they become slender and angular.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous reproductions exists in the literature, cf. ''int. al.'', Ewald and Loewe, ''Exempla, cit.''; Burnam, ''Paleogr. iberica''; Clark, ''Collectanea, cit.''; Garcia Villada, ''Paleogr. española''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Visigothic minuscule appears in a cursive form in documents about the middle of the 9th century, and in the course of time grows more intricate and consequently less legible.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Munoz, ''Paleogr. visigoda''; Garcia Villada, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; It soon came into competition with the Carolingian minuscule, which supplanted it as a result of the presence in Spain of French elements such as [[Cluniac monks]] and warriors engaged in the campaign against the [[Moors]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hessel, ''Ausbreitung der karolingischen Minuskel'' in ''Archiv für Urkundenforschung'', vii, viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish and Anglo-Saxon hands, which were not directly derived from the Roman minuscule cursive, will be discussed in a [[#Irish and Anglo-Saxon Writing|separate sub-section below]].

=== Set minuscule writing ===
One by one, the national minuscule cursive hands were replaced by a set minuscule hand which has already been mentioned and its origins may now be traced from the beginning.

==== Half-uncial writing ====
The early cursive was the medium in which the minuscule forms were gradually evolved from the corresponding majuscule forms. Minuscule writing was therefore cursive in its inception. As the minuscule letters made their appearance in the cursive writing of documents, they were adopted and given calligraphic form by the copyists of literary texts, so that the set minuscule alphabet was constituted gradually, letter by letter, following the development of the minuscule cursive. Just as some documents written in the early cursive show a mixture of majuscule and minuscule forms, so certain literary papyri of the 3rd century,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxyrhynchus Papyri, cit.'', iv, pl. vi, No. 668; xi, pl. vi, No. 1,379.&lt;/ref&gt; and inscriptions on stone of the 4th century&lt;ref&gt;''Pal. Soc., cit.'', pl. 127-8; ''Arch. pal. ital., cit.'', v, pl. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; yield examples of a mixed set hand, with minuscule forms side by side with capital and uncial letters. The number of minuscule forms increases steadily in texts written in the mixed hand, and especially in marginal notes, until by the end of the 5th century the majuscule forms have almost entirely disappeared in some [[manuscript]]s. This quasi-minuscule writing, known as the "half-uncial"&lt;ref&gt;Cf. many examples in [[Émile Chatelain]], ''Semiuncial Script, passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; thus derives from a long line of mixed hands which, in a synoptic chart of [[Latin script]]s, would appear close to the oldest ''librariae'', and between them and the ''epistolaris'' (cursive), from which its characteristic forms were successively derived. It had a considerable influence on the continental ''scriptura libraria'' of the 7th and 8th centuries.

==== Irish and Anglo-Saxon writing ====
The half-uncial hand was introduced in Ireland along with Latin culture in the 5th century by priests and laymen from [[Gaul]], fleeing before the barbarian invasions. It was adopted there to the exclusion of the cursive, and soon took on a distinct character. There are two well established classes of Irish writing as early as the 7th century: a large round half-uncial hand, in which certain majuscule forms frequently appear, and a pointed hand, which becomes more cursive and more genuinely minuscule. The latter developed out of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Wolfgang Keller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IKA3QwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Angelsächsische Palaeographie''], Mayer &amp; Müller, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the distinguishing marks of manuscripts of Irish origin is to be found in the initial letters, which are ornamented by interlacing, animal forms, or a frame of red dots. The most certain evidence, however, is provided by the system of abbreviations and by the combined square and cuneiform appearance of the minuscule at the height of its development.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Schiapparelli in ''Arch. stor. ital., cit.'', lxxiv, ii, pp. 1–126.&lt;/ref&gt; The two types of Irish writing were introduced in the north of Great Britain by the monks, and were soon adopted by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], being so exactly copied that it is sometimes difficult to determine the origin of an example. Gradually, however, the Anglo-Saxon writing developed a distinct style, and even local types,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Keller, ''op. cit.''; W.M. Lindsay, [https://archive.org/details/earlywelshscript00lind ''Early Welsh Script''], Oxford: J. Parker &amp; Co., 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; which were superseded after the Norman conquest by the Carolingian minuscule. Through [[St Columba]] and his followers, Irish writing spread to the continent, and manuscripts were written in the Irish hand in the monasteries of [[Bobbio Abbey]] and [[St Gall]] during the 7th and 8th centuries.

==== Pre-Caroline ====
James J. John points out that the disappearance of imperial authority around the end of the 5th century in most of the Latin-speaking half of the Roman Empire does not entail the disappearance of the Latin scripts, but rather introduced conditions that would allow the various provinces of the West gradually to drift apart in their writing habits, a process that began around the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;James J. John, "Latin Paleography", in J. Powell, ''Medieval Studies'', 2nd. ed. (Syracuse: [[Syracuse University Press]], 1992), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory I]] (Gregory the Great, d. 604) was influential in the spread of Christianity to Britain and also sent Queens Theodelinde and Brunhilda, as well as Spanish bishops, copies of manuscripts. Furthermore, he sent the Roman monk [[Augustine of Canterbury]] to Britain on a missionary journey, on which Augustine may have brought manuscripts. Although Italy's dominance as a centre of manuscript production began to decline, especially after the [[Gothic War (535–554)]] and the invasions by the [[Lombards]], its manuscripts—and more important, the scripts in which they were written—were distributed across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bernhard Bischoff]], ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages'', trans. Daibi O Croinin and David Ganz (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1990), pp. 83–112; 190–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 6th through the 8th centuries, a number of so-called 'national hands' were developed throughout the Latin-speaking areas of the former Roman Empire. By the late 6th century Irish scribes had begun transforming Roman scripts into Insular minuscule and majuscule scripts. A series of transformations, for book purposes, of the cursive documentary script that had grown out of the later Roman cursive would get under way in France by the mid-7th century. In Spain half-uncial and cursive would both be transformed into a new script, the Visigothic minuscule, no later than the early 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;John, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Carolingian minuscule ====
[[File:Charlemagne miniscule.jpg|thumb|200px|A page in [[Carolingian minuscule]] (''[[Book of Exodus]]'')]]
Beginning in the 8th century, as [[Charlemagne]] began to consolidate power over a large area of western Europe, scribes developed a minuscule script ([[Caroline minuscule]]) that effectively became the standard script for manuscripts from the 9th to the 11th centuries. The origin of this hand is much disputed. This is due to the confusion which prevailed before the Carolingian period in the ''libraria'' in France, Italy and Germany as a result of the competition between the cursive and the set hands. In addition to the calligraphic uncial and half-uncial writings, which were imitative forms, little used and consequently without much vitality, and the minuscule cursive, which was the most natural hand, there were innumerable varieties of mixed writing derived from the influence of these hands on each other. In some, the uncial or half-uncial forms were preserved with little or no modification, but the influence of the cursive is shown by the freedom of the strokes; these are known as rustic, semi-cursive or cursive uncial or half-uncial hands. Conversely, the cursive was sometimes affected, in varying degrees, by the set ''librariae''; the cursive of the ''epistolaris'' became a semi-cursive when adopted as a ''libraria''. Nor is this all. Apart from these reciprocal influences affecting the movement of the hand across the page, there were [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] influences at work, letters being borrowed from one alphabet for another. This led to compromises of all softs and of infinite variety between the uncial and half-uncial and the cursive. It will readily be understood that the origin of the Carolingian minuscule, which must be sought in this tangle of pre-Carolingian hands, involves disagreement. The new writing is admittedly much more closely related to the ''epistolaris'' than the primitive minuscule; this is shown by certain forms, such as the open '''''a''''' ([[File:Hand 1.1 sample a 2.png|20px]]), which recall the cursive, by the joining of certain letters, and by the clubbing of the tall letters '''''b d h l''''', which resulted from a cursive ''[[Ductus (linguistics)|ductus]]''. Most palaeographers agree in assigning the new hand the place shown in the following table:&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

| Pre-Carolingian&lt;br /&gt;Carolingian
| Semi-cursive
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
Controversy turns on the question whether the Carolingian minuscule is the primitive minuscule as modified by the influence of the cursive or a cursive based on the primitive minuscule. Its place of origin is also uncertain: Rome, the [[Palatine]] school, [[Tours]], [[Reims]], [[Metz]], [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] and [[Corbie]] have been suggested, but no agreement has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''int. al.'', Harald Steinacker in ''Miscellanea Francesco Ehrle'', Rome, 1924, iv, pp. 126ff; G. Cencetti, "Postilla nuova a un problema paleografico vecchio: l'origine della minuscola carolina", in ''Nova Historia'', 1955, pp. 1–24; B. Bischoff, ''Latin Palaeography: Antiquity and the Middle Ages, cit.'', pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the appearance of the new hand is a turning point in the history of culture. So far as Latin writing is concerned, it marks the dawn of [[Early modern period|modern times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |last=Thompson |first=Edward Maunde |wstitle=Palaeography |volume=20 |pages=556–579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gothic minuscule ====
In the 12th century, Carolingian minuscule underwent a change in its appearance and adopted bold and broken [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]] letter-forms. This style remained predominant, with some regional variants, until the 15th century, when the [[Renaissance]] [[humanism|humanistic]] scripts revived a version of Carolingian minuscule. It then spread from the Italian [[Renaissance]] all over Europe.

These humanistic scripts are the base for the [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]] and the handwriting forms in western and southern Europe. In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], the ''[[Kurrentschrift]]'' was rooted in the [[cursive]] handwriting of the later [[Middle Ages]].  With the name of the [[calligrapher]] Ludwig [[Sütterlin]], this handwriting counterpart to the [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s was abolished by [[Hitler]] in 1941. After [[World War II]], it was taught as an alternative script in some areas until the 1970s; it is no longer taught. [[Secretary hand]] is an informal business hand of the Renaissance.

There are undeniable points of contact between [[History of architecture|architecture]] and palaeography, and in both it is possible to distinguish a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. The creative effort which began in the post-Carolingian period culminated at the beginning of the 12th century in a [[calligraphy]] and an architecture which, though still somewhat awkward, showed unmistakable signs of power and experience, and at the end of that century and in the first half of the 13th both arts reached their climax and made their boldest flights. The topography of later medieval writing is still being studied; national varieties can, of course, be' identified but the problem of distinguishing features becomes complicated as a result of the development of international relations, and the migration of clerks from one end of Europe to the other. During the later centuries of the [[Middle Ages]] the Gothic minuscule continued to improve within the restricted circle of ''de luxe'' editions and ceremonial documents. In common use, it degenerated into a cursive which became more and more intricate, full of superfluous strokes and complicated by abbreviations. In the first quarter of the 15th century an innovation took place which exercised a decisive influence on the evolution of writing in Europe. The Italian [[humanism|humanists]] were struck by the eminent legibility of the manuscripts, written in the improved Carolingian minuscule of the 10th and 11th centuries, in which they discovered the works of ancient authors, and carefully imitated the old writing. In [[Petrarch]]'s compact book hand, the wider leading and reduced compression and round curves are early manifestations of the reaction against the crabbed Gothic secretarial minuscule we know today as "[[Blackletter#Gothic minuscule|blackletter]]"; Petrarch was one of the few medieval authors to have written at any length on the handwriting of his time; in his essay on the subject, ''La scrittura''&lt;ref&gt;Petrarch, ''La scrittura'', discussed by Armando Petrucci, ''La scrittura di Francesco Petrarca'' (Vatican City) 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; he criticized the current scholastic hand, with its laboured strokes (''artificiosis litterarum tractibus'') and exuberant (''luxurians'') letter-forms amusing the eye from a distance, but fatiguing on closer exposure, as if written for other purpose than to be read. For Petrarch the gothic hand violated three principles: writing, he said, should be simple (''castigata''), clear (''clara'') and orthographically correct.&lt;ref&gt;Petrarch, ''La scrittura'', noted in Albert Derolez, "The script reform of Petrarch: an illusion?" in John Haines, Randall Rosenfeld, eds. ''Music and Medieval Manuscripts: paleography and performance'' 2006:5f; Derolez discusses the ''degree'' of Petrarch's often alluded-to reform.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boccaccio]] was a great admirer of Petrarch; from Boccaccio's immediate circle this post-Petrarchan "semi-gothic" revised hand spread to ''literati'' in [[Florence]], [[Lombardy]]&lt;ref&gt;Mirella Ferrari "La 'littera antiqua' a Milan, 1417–1439" in Johanne Autenrieth, ed. ''Renaissance- und Humanistenhandschriften'', (Munich:  Oldenbourg,) 1988:21–29.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Veneto]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhiannon Daniels, ''Boccaccio and the book: production and reading in Italy 1340–1520'', 2009:28.&lt;/ref&gt; A more thorough reform of handwriting than the Petrarchan compromise was in the offing. The generator of the new style (''illustration'') was [[Poggio Bracciolini]], a tireless pursuer of ancient manuscripts, who developed the new [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] script in the first decade of the 15th century. The Florentine bookseller [[Vespasiano da Bisticci]] recalled later in the century that Poggio had been a very fine [[calligraphy|calligrapher]] of ''lettera antica'' and had transcribed texts to support himself—presumably, as Martin Davies points out—&lt;ref&gt;Davies, in Kraye (ed.) 1996:51.&lt;/ref&gt; before he went to Rome in 1403 to begin his career in the [[papal curia]]. [[Berthold Ullman]] identifies the watershed moment in the development of the new humanistic hand as the youthful Poggio's transcription of [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Epistulae ad Atticum|Epistles to Atticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, ''The Origin and Development of Humanistic Script'' (Rome) 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the [[Medici]] library was catalogued in 1418, almost half the manuscripts were noted as in the ''lettera antica''. The new script was embraced and developed by the Florentine humanists and educators [[Niccolò de' Niccoli]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Morison]], "Early humanistic script and the first roman type", reprinted in his ''Selected Essays on the History of Letter-Forms in Manuscript and Print'', ed. by David McKitterick, 2 vols. 1981:206-29.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coluccio Salutati]]. The [[papal chancery]] adopted the new fashion for some purposes, and thus contributed to its diffusion throughout [[Christendom]]. The printers played a still more significant part in establishing this form of writing by using it, from the year 1465, as the basis for their types. The humanistic minuscule soon gave rise to a sloping cursive hand, known as the Italian, which was also taken up by printers in search of novelty and thus became the [[italic type]]. In consequence, the [[Italic script|Italian hand]] became widely used, and in the 16th century began to compete with the Gothic cursive. In the 17th century, writing masters were divided between the two schools, and there was in addition a whole series of compromises. The Gothic characters gradually disappeared, except a few that survived in Germany. The Italian became universally used, brought to perfection in more recent times by English calligraphers.&lt;ref name="Bouar" /&gt;

[[File:The Fine Brothers at the 2010 Streamy Awards.jpg|thumb|The Fine Brothers, creators of the ''React'' franchise]]
'''''React''''' (sometimes stylized in all caps as '''''REACT''''')  is a [[media franchise]] used by the [[Fine Brothers]] consisting of several online series centering on a group of individuals reacting to [[viral video]]s, trends, [[video games]], film trailers, or [[music videos]]. React was also the first react channel on YouTube. The franchise was launched with the YouTube debut of ''Kids React'' in October 2010, and then grew to encompass four more series uploaded on the Fine Brothers' primary [[YouTube]] channel, a separate YouTube channel with various reaction-related content, as well as a television series titled ''[[React to That]]''.

In 2016, the duo announced ''React World'', a program and channel in which they would license the format of their ''React'' shows to creators, which led to widespread negative reception from viewers and fellow content creators, as well as confusion about what their format is. This eventually lead to the Fine Brothers to removing all videos related to ''React World'', essentially pulling the plug on the ''React World'' program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/43sjmj/the_fine_brothers_announce_cancellation_of_react/&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Kids React''===
Benny and Rafi Fine launched a series titled ''Kids React'' on October 16, 2010, the first video being "Kids React to Viral Videos (''[[Double Rainbow (viral video)|Double Rainbow]]'', Obama Fail, Twin Rabbits, [[Snickers]] [[Halloween]])".{{sfn|Jaworski|2013}} The ''Kids React'' series features The Fine Brothers, off-camera, showing kids ages 4–14 (7-13 as of September 2016, 7-11 as of October 2016) several viral videos or popular YouTubers and having the kids react to the videos.{{sfn|Hallam|2010}}{{sfn|O'Neill|2010}}{{sfn|"Kids React to Epic Meal Time"|2011}}{{sfn|Whitney|2012}}

The most popular ''Kids React'' episode to date is “Kids React to Gay Marriage", with over 40.2 million views as of September 2, 2018. The popularity of ''Kids React'' made it possible for the online series to win a special [[Emmy Award]] at the [[39th Daytime Emmy Awards]] in 2012.{{sfn|Hernandez|2012}} The Emmy Award, that was given in cooperation with [[AOL]], was awarded to the Fine Brothers for "Best Viral Video Series".{{sfn|Paredes|2012}} After their Emmy win, the brothers stated, "Not a lot has changed [after winning the Emmy] other than realizing that there are shows on YouTube like ''React'' that can get similar if not better viewership than mainstream entertainment can."{{sfn|Jaworski|2013}}

Videos and YouTube stars that have been reacted to by the kids include [[Smosh]] (who later reacted to the kids' reactions{{sfn|"Smosh Reacts"|2011}}), [[planking (fad)|planking]]{{sfn|Chansanchai|2011}} and [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] [[Death of Osama bin Laden#U.S. presidential address|addressing the death of]] [[Osama bin Laden]],{{sfn|Choi|2011}}{{sfn|Hustvedt|2011}} among several other topics.{{sfn|Johnson|2011}}{{sfn|Idolator Staff|2011}} ''Kids React'' has been compared to ''[[Kids Say the Darndest Things]]''.{{sfn|Brustein|2014}}{{sfn|Sullivan|2011}} In October 2012, the kids of the show were shown videos of the [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|2012 U.S. Presidential debates]].{{sfn|Von Baldegg|2012}} ''Kids React'' won the Streamy Award for Best Non-Fiction or Reality Series in 2013.{{sfn|"Pre-Live Streamy Winners Announced"|2013}}

===''Teens React''===
Due to the popularity of ''Kids React'', The Fine Brothers spawned a spin-off dubbed ''Teens React'' on November 17, 2011 with "TEENS REACT TO [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|TWILIGHT]]".{{sfn|O'Neill|2011}} The show has a similar premise to ''Kids React'', however the younger stars are replaced with teens, some of whom have aged out of the ''Kids React'' series. Due to this, the Fine Brothers are able to show more mature and less "kid-friendly" videos such as videos on topics like ''[[Toddlers &amp; Tiaras]]'',{{sfn|Chansanchai|2012}} [[Rick Perry]]'s ''[[Rick Perry presidential campaign, 2012#Appeals to Christian voters|Strong]]'' commercial,{{sfn|Frauenfelder|2011}} [[Suicide of Amanda Todd|Amanda Todd's death]],{{sfn|Lum|2012}} and the [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|2012 U.S. Presidential debates]]. Other viral videos and YouTube stars that have been reacted to include ''[[Salad Fingers]]'', the ''[[Overly Attached Girlfriend]]'', "[[Gangnam Style]]", ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'' trailer,{{sfn|Johnson|2012}} [[Shane Dawson]],{{sfn|"Shane Dawson: Watch Teens Reacting"|2012}} and [[One Direction]],{{sfn|Orenstein|2012}} among other topics.  Later on The Fine Brothers launched a series named ''Teens React: Gaming'' consisting videos of teens reacting to popular games such as ''[[Mario Kart 64]], [[Flappy Bird]]'', and ''[[Rocket League]]''.{{sfn|Hilliard|2015}} Teens React launched the career of [[Lia Marie Johnson]] and also featured some "famous" 'reactors' as guest stars, including [[Lisa Cimorelli]], [[Amy Cimorelli]], [[Lucas Cruikshank]] (who later appears in Youtubers React), [[Alex Steele]], [[Jake Short]], and [[Maisie Williams]].{{sfn|Moran|2015}}

===''Elders React''===
The popularity of ''Kids React'' and ''Teens React'' spawned ''Elders React'' on May 24, 2012 with "ELDERS REACT TO NYAN CAT". The Elders React series replaces young children and teenagers with the elderly, including Benny and Rafi's father, Yehuda.{{sfn|"Elders React To Skrillex"|2012}} Initially starting with topics that have been discussed on the other ''React'' series, they currently discuss about topics that appeals to today's 21st century society such as violent video games and music videos.

===''YouTubers React''===
The first episode of ''YouTubers React'' premiered December 6, 2012. The first episode was "YouTubers React to Viral Videos Ep. #1". Several notable YouTubers have appeared on the series.{{sfn|Gutelle|2012}} [[Tay Zonday]], [[Rebecca Black]] and [[Liam Kyle Sullivan]] have each reacted to one of their own videos, "[[Chocolate Rain]]," "[[Friday (Rebecca Black song)|Friday]]" and "[[Shoes (Kelly song)|Shoes]]" respectively.{{sfn|Dreier|2013}}

===''Adults React''===
On May 30, 2015, the Fine Brothers announced ''Adults React'', which premiered on July 16 later that year. It consists of people ages 20 to 55, including former stars of ''Teens React'' that have aged out of the series. Depending on the video or topic, ''Adults React'' will be specific of which type of adults are going to be reacting, such as parents or young adults.{{sfn|Fine Brothers|2015}}

===''College Kids React''===
The first episode of ''College Kids React'' premiered on June 23, 2016 with "College Kids React to [[The 1975]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufwfMo4BRak|title=College Kids React to The 1975|publisher=Fine Brothers Entertainment|website=[[YouTube]]|date=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series includes stars who have aged out of ''Teens React'' alongside new stars, as well as stars that have not yet aged out of ''Teens React'' but have begun college. The content of ''College Kids React'' is similar to the content found in ''Teens React''.

===One-off episodes===
In April 2014, as an [[April Fool's]] joke, the Fine Brothers teamed up with [[Friskies]] and released ''Cats React'', which went viral.{{sfn|Cohen|2014}} In July 2016 they released another part of ''Cats React''.

In August 2014, they released ''Celebrities React to Viral Videos''.

In April 2018, an another April Fools’s joke, they released ‘’Teens React to Nothing’’ where they showed teens a blank screen.

==React YouTube channel==
After creating four individual successful ''React'' series on their primary YouTube channel, the Fine Brothers launched a separate YouTube channel in 2014, for reaction-related content, simply dubbed "React".{{sfn|Spangler|2014}} With the intent of running programming five days a week,{{sfn|Spangler|2014}} the channel launched with five series: ''Games'' (a [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] style series with cast members from their primary ''React'' series), ''Advice'' (a series featuring cast members respond to questions from viewers), ''React Remix'' (musical remixes of past ''React'' footage), ''People Vs. Foods'' (a series featuring Reactors taste test "Weird" or international foods), and ''Lyric Breakdown'' (a series in which Reactors break down the meaning of various songs).{{sfn|Gutelle|2014}} The channel launched with a teen-centered playthrough of ''[[Goat Simulator]]''.{{sfn|Van Winkle|2014}} Similar to the teens, the elders also have played and reacted to video games such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]''. Kids and Adults also played and reacted to video games too.{{sfn|Farokhmanesh|2015}}

==''React to That''==
In early 2014, it was announced that the Fine Brothers made a deal with Ncredible Entertainment, a production studio founded by [[Nick Cannon]] to develop a television series for [[Nickelodeon]].{{sfn|Patel|2014}} The series, dubbed ''[[React to That]]'', was "entirely re-envisioned for television," as the reactors "not only watch and respond to viral videos, but pop out of the reaction room and into showdowns where the clips come to life as each reactor is confronted with a challenge based on the video they just watched."{{sfn|Block|2014}} Following the announcement of the series, Benny Fine stated, "All these viewers now watching are also pioneering what it is to be a viewer of content. They follow us through all of our different endeavors, all our different series, and now will have the opportunity to follow us to another medium."{{sfn|Block|2014}} Nickelodeon ordered 13 episodes to be produced,{{sfn|Block|2014}} but only 12 were made and aired.{{sfn|Spangler|2016}}

==React World==

===Background===
In July 2015, the Fine Brothers filed for trademark protection on "React" with the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO).{{sfn|Spangler|2016}} The trademark was filed for "Entertainment services, namely, providing an ongoing series of programs and webisodes via the internet in the field of observing and interviewing various groups of people."{{sfn|Hern|2016}} The USPTO approved for a 30-day opposition period which was set to begin on February 2, 2016; if no parties filed an opposition to the Fines' trademark request, it would have proceeded through the process.{{sfn|Machkovech|2016}} The brothers had previously filed for and been granted trademark registrations for "Elders React" and "Teens React" in 2013 as well as "Kids React" in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Fine mess: how not to assert your copyright in the YouTube age|url = https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/6/10926230/fine-bros-react-world-controversy|website = The Verge|access-date = February 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Announcement details===
On January 26, 2016, the Fines announced that they would be launching React World, a way to grant content creators the license to create their own versions of the ''React'' shows.{{sfn|Spangler|2016}}{{sfn|Fine Brothers|2016a}} Specifically, the Fine Brothers stated they are licensing the format of their ''React'' shows.{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}} A ''Variety'' report detailed that React World would "aggregate videos in a channel to launch later this year to promote, support and feature fan-produced programming based on their shows."{{sfn|Spangler|2016}}  The brothers' company, Fine Brothers Entertainment (FBE) stated they would be working with YouTube and ChannelMeter on the launch of React World.{{sfn|Shah|2016}} FBE also expressed they would be able to monetize ''React''-style videos uploaded under their license.{{sfn|Spangler|2016}}{{sfn|Fine Brothers|2016a}} On monetization, ''Digital Trends'' detailed "Although licenses are free, React World creators must agree to share 20 percent of AdSense revenue and 30 percent of premium brand deals with FBE."{{sfn|Shah|2016}} Additionally, the Fines stated they will provide ongoing production guidance, creative guidelines, format bibles, and other resources, as well as promotional and technical support to those creators who participated with the brothers on React World.{{sfn|Shah|2016}}

===Reception===
Although YouTube's VP on content partnerships, Kelly Merryman, originally proclaimed "This is brand-building in the YouTube age — rising media companies building their brands through collaborations with creators around the world,"{{sfn|Spangler|2016}} the Fine Brothers were met with overwhelmingly negative reception to their React World announcement.{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}}{{sfn|Shah|2016}}{{sfn|Baker-Whitelaw|2016}} ''[[BBC News]]'' reported that "critics of the Fine Brothers have expressed concern they may use the trademarks to stifle competition," and quoted one YouTuber who detailed "People don't trust them because a few years ago when [[Ellen DeGeneres]] did a similar video—not that similar, it didn't have the same format or branding—they claimed it was their format."{{sfn|Foxx|2016}} Viewers and fellow content creators alike condemned the Fines for their announcement, with ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' reporting, "Backlash poured in on [[Reddit]] and social media, and other YouTubers posted their own reactions and parodies of the enthusiastically corporate React World announcement video."{{sfn|Baker-Whitelaw|2016}} The backlash led to a dramatic drop in subscribers,{{sfn|Mooney|2016}} with upwards of 675,000{{#tag:ref|As of February 22, 2016. Not including positive subs counts.|group = "n"}} accounts collectively unsubscribing from the React and Fine Bros Entertainment channels as well as recent videos getting many dislikes in [[protest]] as of February 22, 2016.&lt;ref name="fbe30days"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fine Brothers Entertainment 30 days|url=http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/thefinebros/monthly|website=Social Blade|publisher=Maker Studio|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rc30days"&gt;{{cite web|title=React Channel 30 Days|url=http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/react/monthly|website=Social Blade|publisher=Makers Studio|accessdate=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|"Fine Brothers Entertainment"|n.d.}} ''[[Mashable]]'' described that one Reddit post "ignited a thread of haters, defenders and overall discussion about whether what Fine Brothers Entertainment is doing is fair."{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}} [[Ryan Morrison]], a gamer, lawyer and Reddit user, declared that he would file a legal challenge to the Fine Brothers' trademark request on "React", writing "These guys didn’t come up with the idea of filming funny reactions from kids. And they certainly don’t own an entire genre of YouTube videos. It wasn’t their idea, and it’s not theirs to own or police."{{sfn|Hathaway|2016}}

Though there was an overwhelmingly negative response to the React World announcement, other personalities expressed milder opinions; Internet personality [[Hank Green]] wrote "this could actually be a very cool project if it could be divorced from the idea of two very powerful creators attempting to control a very popular YouTube video format. Franchising one of YouTube's biggest shows? Yeah, I’d love to see how that goes."{{sfn|Hathaway|2016}} ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' reporter Jay Hathaway wrote "The trademark and React World are dead. And that's a shame, because it was an interesting idea that suffered from tone-deaf execution."{{sfn|Hathaway|2016}}

===Responses and discontinuation by the Fine Brothers===
After seeing the initial backlash from their announcement, The Fine Brothers posted comments on various social media websites including [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], Reddit, and the comment section of their YouTube announcement video.{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}} On Facebook the Fines wrote, "We do not own the idea or copyright for reaction videos overall, nor did we ever say we did. You don’t need anyone’s permission to make these kinds of videos, and we’re not coming after anyone," adding "We are in no way claiming reaction content in general is our intellectual property. This is purely a voluntary program for people wanting direct support from us, and we continue to be so excited to work with all of you who may want to participate."{{sfn|Baker-Whitelaw|2016}}{{sfn|Fine Brothers|2016a}} They additionally tweeted "We're not saying we hold a copyright on reaction videos overall, no one can. We're licensing our specific shows, like TV has done for years."{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}} The brothers also stated they would "not be trying to take revenue from other types of reaction videos, and will not be copyright-striking."{{sfn|Hamedy|2016}} However, other YouTubers have reported multiple copyright related video takedowns.{{sfn|8-Bit Eric|2016}}{{sfn|LeKevPlays|2016}} ''[[The Guardian]]'' also reported that unrelated channels featuring other groups of people reacting to videos were also removed after takedown requests from the Fine Brothers; the "Seniors React" video was noted to be released prior to the Fines launching their ''Elders React'' series.{{sfn|Hern|2016}} The Fines also posted an update video in response to what they described as "confusion and negative response" to React World, in which they try to clear up confusion on what their format encompasses, as well as inviting viewers to e-mail them about any further questions.{{sfn|Baker-Whitelaw|2016}}

Ultimately, the Fine Brothers removed all React World videos,{{sfn|Yin-Poole|2016}} and posted a statement on ''[[Medium (website)|Medium]]'', declaring they have filed the paperwork to [[Rescission (contract law)|rescind]] all their "React" trademarks and applications, will discontinue the React World program, and will release all past Content ID claims.{{sfn|Fine Brothers|2016b}} In their post, the brothers expressed "It makes perfect sense for people to distrust our motives here, but we are confident that our actions will speak louder than these words moving forward."{{sfn|Rundle|2016}} Reaction to this ''Medium'' post was negative on Reddit, where users were reported commenting they would not forgive the Fine Brothers.{{sfn|Rundle|2016}}

'''Redshift''' is a techno-economic theory suggesting hypersegmentation{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} of [[information technology]] markets based on whether individual computing needs are over or under-served by [[Moore's law]], which predicts the doubling of computing transistors (and therefore roughly computing power) every two years.  The theory,
proposed and named by [[New Enterprise Associates]] partner and former [[Sun Microsystems]] CTO [[Greg Papadopoulos]], categorized a series of high growth markets (redshifting) while predicting slower GDP-driven growth in traditional computing markets (blueshifting). Papadopoulos predicted the result will be a fundamental redesign of components comprising computing systems.

==Hypergrowth market segments (redshifting)==
According to the Redshift theory, applications "redshift" when they grow dramatically faster than Moore's Law allows, growing quickly in their absolute number of systems.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"&gt;Greg Papadopoulos: Sun Analyst Summit 2007, http://sun.feedroom.com/linking/?skin=oneclip&amp;fr_story=FEEDROOM178646&amp;hl=false&lt;/ref&gt;  In these markets, customers are running out of datacenter real-estate, power and cooling infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, June 14, 2006: https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/technology/14search.html?ex=1307937600&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dell]] Senior Vice President Brad Anderson, “Businesses requiring [[hyperscale]] computing environments – where infrastructure deployments are measured by up to millions of servers, storage and networking equipment – are changing the way they approach IT.”&lt;ref&gt;Dell Press Release: http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_03_27_rr_000?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp&lt;/ref&gt;

While various Redshift proponents offer minor alterations on the original presentation, “Redshifting” generally includes:&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

=== ΣBW (Sum-of-[[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]]) ===
These are companies that drive heavy [[Internet]] traffic.  This includes popular web-portals like [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], [[AOL]] and [[MSN]].  It also includes [[Telecommunications service provider|telecoms]], multimedia, television over IP, online games like [[World of Warcraft]] and others.{{which|date=November 2010}}  This segment has been enabled by widespread availability of high-bandwidth Internet connections to consumers through a [[DSL]] or [[cable modem]]. A simple way to understand this market is that for every [[byte]] of content served to a PC, mobile phone or other device over a network, there must exist computing systems to send it over the network.

=== [[High performance computing]] (HPC) ===
These are companies that do complex simulations that involve (for example) weather, stock markets or drug-design simulations.  This is a generally elastic market because businesses frequently spend every "available" dollar budgeted for IT. A common anecdote claims that cutting the cost of computing by half causes customers in this segment to buy at least twice as much, because each marginal IT dollar spent contributes to business advantage.

=== *prise (or "Star-prise") ===
These are companies that aggregate traditional computing applications and offer them as services, typically in the form of [[Software as a service|Software as a Service (SaaS)]].  For example, companies that deploy [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] are over-served by Moore's Law, but companies that aggregate CRM functions and offer them as a service, such as [[Salesforce.com]], grow faster than Moore's Law.

=== The eBay crisis ===
A prime example of redshift was a crisis at [[eBay]].  In 1999 eBay suffered a database crisis when a single [[Oracle Database]] running on the fastest [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] machine available (these tracking Moore's law in this period) was not enough to cope with eBay's growth.  The solution was to massively parallelise their system architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smoothspan.wordpress.com/2007/08/30/youve-already-had-a-multicore-crisis-and-just-didnt-realize-it/ You’ve Already Had a Multicore Crisis and Just Didn’t Realize It!] (Bob Warfield, ''SmoothSpan Blog'', 2007-08-30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randy Shoup and Dan Pritchett. [http://www.addsimplicity.com/downloads/eBaySDForum2006-11-29.pdf "The eBay Architecture: Striking a balance between site stability, feature velocity, performance, and cost."] SD Forum 2006 proceedings, November 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional computing markets (blueshifting)==
Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets, such as those serving [[enterprise resource planning]] or [[customer relationship management]] applications, have reached relative saturation in industrialized nations.  Thereafter, proponents argued further market growth will closely follow [[gross domestic product]] growth, which typically remains under 10% for most countries annually. Given that Moore's Law continues to predict accurately the rate of computing transistor growth, which roughly translates into computing power doubling every two years, the Redshift theory suggests that traditional computing markets will ultimately contract as a percentage of computing expenditures over time.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

Functionally, this means “Blueshifting” customers can satisfy computing requirement growth by swapping in faster processors without increasing the absolute number of computing systems.

==Consequences and industry commentary==
Papadopoulos argued that while traditional computing markets remain the dominant source of revenue through the late 2000s, a shift to hypergrowth markets will inevitably occur.  When that shift occurs, he argued computing (but not computers) will become a utility, and differentiation in
the IT market will be based upon a company's ability to deliver computing at massive scale, efficiently and with predictable service levels, much like electricity at that time.&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt;

If computing is to be delivered as a utility, [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] suggested Papadopoulos' vision compares with [[Microsoft]] researcher Jim Hamilton, who both agree that computing is most efficiently generated in [[shipping containers]]&lt;!-- Makes no sense --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Rough Type (Nicholas Carr's blog): http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/02/the_future_of_c.php and http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/03/showdown_in_the_1.php&lt;/ref&gt; Industry analysts are also beginning to quantify Redshifting and Blueshifting markets.  According to [[International Data Corporation]] vice president Matthew Eastwood, "IDC believes that the IT market is in a period of hyper segmentation... This a class of customers that is Moore's law driven and as price performance gains continue, IDC believes that these organizations will accelerate their consumption of IT infrastructure.”&lt;ref&gt;IDC Link: http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=lcUS20623507&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and nomenclature==
Key portions of Papadopoulos' theory were first presented by Sun Microsystems CEO [[Jonathan I. Schwartz|Jonathan Schwartz]] in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Blackbox Press Conference: http://sun.feedroom.com/?skin=oneclip&amp;fr_story=73d774789da2b024c111f8cfc7948af6d1577827&amp;rf=bm&lt;/ref&gt; Papadopoulos later gave a full presentation on Redshift to Sun's annual Analyst Summit&lt;ref name="gregspeech"/&gt; in February 2007. The term [[Redshift]] refers to what happens when electromagnetic radiation, usually visible light, moves away from an observer.  Papadopoulos chose this term to reflect growth markets because redshift helped cosmologists explain the expansion of the universe.

Papadopoulos originally depicted traditional IT markets as green to represent their revenue base, but later changed them to “blueshift,” which occurs when a light source moves toward an observer, similar to what would happen during a contraction of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, April 12, 2007: http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9013563&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7811">{{About|the literary concept||Resistance (disambiguation){{!}}Resistance}}
'''Resistance''' is a mythical concept created by [[United States|American]] novelist [[Steven Pressfield]] that illustrates the universal force that he claims acts against human [[creativity]].{{sfn|Holiday|2012}} It was first described in his non-fiction book ''[[The War of Art (book)|The War of Art]]''{{sfn|Pressfield|2002}} and elaborated in the follow-up books ''[[Do The Work]]''{{sfn|Pressfield|2011a}} and ''Turning Pro'',{{sfn|Pressfield|2012}} and in other essays.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Pressfield|2011b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a recurring theme in some of his fiction novels such as ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]''{{sfn|Pressfield|1995}} and ''[[The Virtues of War]]''.{{sfn|Pressfield|2004}}

Resistance is described in a [[mythical]] fashion as a universal force that has one sole mission: to keep things as they are. Pressfield claims that Resistance does not have a personal vendetta against anyone, rather it is simply trying to accomplish its only mission.{{sfn|Pressfield|2002|p=11}} It is the force that will stop an individual's creative activity through any means necessary, whether it be [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalizing]], inspiring [[fear]] and [[anxiety]], emphasizing other [[distraction]]s that require attention, raising the voice of an [[inner critic]], and much more. It will use any tool to stop creation flowing from an individual, no matter what field the creation is in.{{sfn|Pressfield|2002|pp=4–56}}

Pressfield goes on to claim that Resistance is the most dangerous element to one's life and dreams since its sole mission is to [[sabotage]] aspirations. He explains steps that human beings can take to overcome this force and keep it subdued so that they can create to their fullest potential, although Resistance is never fully gone.{{sfn|Pressfield|2012|p=74}}

Pressfield's concept of Resistance has been cited by authors such as [[Seth Godin]],{{sfn|Godin|2010}} [[David Kadavy]], [[David M. Kelley]] and Tom Kelley,{{sfn|Kelley|Kelley|2013}} [[Eric Liu]] and the [[Lincoln Center Institute]],{{sfn|Liu|Noppe-Brandon|2009}} [[Robert Kiyosaki]] and [[Sharon Lechter]],{{sfn|Kiyosaki|Lechter|2005}} and [[Gina Trapani]].{{sfn|Trapani|2008}}

==Criticism==
Psychologist Frederick Heide has cited Pressfield's book ''[[The War of Art (book)|The War of Art]]'' and questioned whether "fighting" Resistance is always a helpful metaphor; Heide suggested that such [[Agonistic behaviour|agonistic]] metaphors could end up "ironically perpetuating the resistance it predicts."{{sfn|Heide|2010|p=68}} Nevertheless, Heide noted, such an agonistic approach to resistance remains widespread in [[psychotherapeutic]] thinking.{{sfn|Heide|2010|p=79}} Heide cites a scholarly article that points to some alternative nonagonistic strategies for working with resistance in [[Relational psychoanalysis|relational psychoanalytic]] psychotherapy, [[Personal construct theory|personal construct]] therapy, [[narrative therapy]], [[motivational interviewing]], [[process-experiential therapy]], and [[coherence therapy]].{{sfn|Frankel|Levitt|2006|pp=220–221}}

==Controversy==
Censorship advocacy group One Million Moms (part of the [[American Family Association]]) complained about ''Save Me'''s content in June 2013, accusing it of being anti-[[Christianity|Christian]], while focusing its complaints on the character of Beth. The group urged others to protest to NBC to cancel the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Save Me' Disrespects Christianity |url=http://onemillionmoms.com/issues/new-nbc-show-save-me-disrespects-christianity/ |website=One Million Moms |publisher=American Family Association |accessdate=25 May 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610124716/http://onemillionmoms.com/issues/new-nbc-show-save-me-disrespects-christianity/ |archivedate=June 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]], which was one of the treaties that successfully ended the [[Second Northern War]], all areas in the historical region of [[Skåneland]] were ceded by [[Denmark-Norway]] to the [[Swedish Empire]] in early 1658. One of the most important questions for the Swedish Empire was on how to make the Scanians feel like they were Swedish, rather than a part of Denmark. On [[16 April]] 1658, representatives of [[Scania]], [[Blekinge]] and [[Halland]]'s nobility, citizens, clergy and peasants gathered for a day of fury in Malmö Town Hall. On a given sign, the ombuds fell to the knees and promised their new king's faithfulness. The oath was appointed by a secretary. [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X Gustav]] was not present himself but was represented by an empty chair surrounded by Swedish soldiers.

In 1662 a so-called farm day in Malmö was held, where the Scanians accepted new taxes and regulations that differed completely from Danish law. "Lilla tullen" ("the small customs") was such an idea. All goods brought into the cities would be charged with customs, just as in all Swedish cities. In each city council there should also be at least two Swedish-born people among the councilors. In the same way as in the rest of Sweden, the cities were divided into [[Staple right|stacks]] and settlements. Many nationals also forced into mayor seats. At the same time, the inhabitants of Scania received representation in the [[Riksdag]], unlike other areas that had been conquered by the Swedish Empire.

As early as when Charles X Gustav landed in Helsingborg in 1658, he met Bishop [[Peder Winstrup]] from Lund on the pier. The bishop became a driving force for the establishment of [[University of Lund]] as a Swedish counterweight to [[University of Copenhagen]]. In 1666 the university was established under the name "Regia Academia Carolina". The official opening ceremony took place in January 1668.

The Swedification of Scania did not begin until about two decades after the Roskilde peace treaty.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Larsdotter | first1=Anna | title = Skåningarna bytte aldrig språk | date = 2010 | journal = Språktidningen |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johan Gyllenstierna]] suggested that it should have been done by forced immigration to the Baltics, something that was never carried out.{{clarification needed|date=July 2018}}

'''''Sym-Bionic Titan''''' is an American [[Animated cartoon|animated]] action [[science fiction]] television series created by [[Genndy Tartakovsky]], [[Bryan Andrews (storyboard artist)|Bryan Andrews]], and [[Paul Rudish]] for [[Cartoon Network]]. The series focuses on a trio made up of the alien princess Ilana, the rebellious soldier Lance, and the robot Octus; the three are able to combine to create the titular Sym-Bionic Titan.

A preview of the series was first shown at the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic-Con International]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartoon Network and Adult Swim Series Panels and Events Lineup for 2009 Comic-Con International|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]|date=July 8, 2009|url=http://news.turner.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=4510|accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further details were revealed at Cartoon Network's 2010 [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thill|first=Scott|title=Tartakovsky's Sym-Bionic Titan Boosts Cartoon Network's Sci-Fi Quotient|work=Wired News|publisher=Condé Nast Publications|date=March 25, 2009|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2009/03/chung-tartakovk/|accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartoon Network Continues its Evolution with Largest, Most Diverse Development Slate in Network History|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|date=March 25, 2009|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/print/0,20858,1891214,00.html|accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on September 17, 2010, and ended on April 9, 2011.

While ''Sym-Bionic Titan'' has never been released to DVD in The United States, all 20 episodes were available for purchase on [[iTunes]] and the [[Windows Store]].

As of 2015, Cartoon Network has [[Write-off|written off]] ''Sym-Bionic Titan'' for financial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bryan |url=http://www.nickandmore.com/2014/09/22/cartoon-network-writes-off-beware-the-batman-sym-bionic-titan/ |title=Cartoon Network Writes Off 'Beware The Batman', 'Sym-Bionic Titan |publisher=Nickandmore.com |date= |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Billed as "an exciting hybrid of high school drama and giant robot battles", ''Sym-Bionic Titan'' features "the adventures of three beings from the planet Galaluna who crash-land on Earth while attempting to escape their war-torn world". The series follows the lives of Lance (voiced by [[Kevin Thoms]]), Ilana ([[Tara Strong]]) and Octus ([[Brian Posehn]]), two alien teens and a robot in the form of humanoids who arrive on Earth, an "identical" planet to Galaluna, while fleeing an evil general who has taken over their home planet with the help of monstrous creatures called Mutraddi.

The three main characters include Ilana, princess of the royal family; Lance, a dark-hearted but capable soldier; and Octus, a bio-cybernetic robot, all of whom must now blend into everyday life in [[Sherman, Illinois]]. Posing as high school students, Lance and Octus work to conceal Princess Ilana from General Modula (Don Leslie) and his hideous space mutants sent to kill the sole heir of Galaluna.

When called into battle, the Galalunans are outfitted with individual armor that provides more than ample protection. It is when the gravest of danger appears that Octus activates the sym-bionic defense program and he, Ilana, and Lance unite "Heart, Body and Mind" and come together to form the spectacular cyber-giant Sym-Bionic Titan.

==Production==
Series co-creator Genndy Tartakovsky, known for creating ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' and ''[[Samurai Jack]]'', drew inspiration from many sources. He grew up with [[mecha anime]] series from the 1970s and 1980s like ''[[Speed Racer]]'', ''[[Macross]]'' and ''[[Voltron]]'' and states: "For whatever reason, I have always loved the idea of kids driving giant robots." His biggest influence were [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] movies like ''[[Sixteen Candles]]'' and ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' as well as 1980s pop culture, but the relationship between the two teenage leads was also inspired by Pazu &amp; Sheeta, the two leads in [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Castle in the Sky]]''.

An episode of ''Samurai Jack'' with a similar plot, "Jack and the Flying Prince and Princess" (having two aliens and a robot fleeing to seek help for their planet), may have also provided inspiration. Tara Strong voiced the princess in said episode as well.

He came up with Octus and the high-school setting first and then later together with co-creators Paul Rudish and Bryan Andrews added Ilana and Lance as protagonists. The creators of the show took a long time to develop the female lead, Princess Ilana. "A positive strong female character is something I've always wanted to create", Tartakovsky said.

Tartakovsky called ''Sym-Bionic Titan'' "the most challenging project I have ever done."&lt;ref name="wiredinterview"/&gt;
Despite airing on  ''Cartoon Network'' Tartakovsky said "he does not consider ''Sym-Bionic Titan'' a kids show.""&lt;ref&gt;"Wiredinterveiw"&lt;/ref&gt;

While Octus, Kimmy, and some of her friends start doing "The Robot," a shape shifting Mutraddi beast lands near the party. The shape shifter disguises itself as Jason and tries to kill Ilana, only to be stopped by Lance. When it shows its true form to the rest of the kids at the party, they all run, giving Lance, Ilana, and Octus time to form Sym-Bionic Titan and kill it.

| ShortSummary = Lance, Ilana, and Octus go deep into the swamp to find a Mutraddi that has landed in the water. They investigate the crashed ship and are attack by an amphibian-like Mutraddi that, after a seemingly easy kill, is able to bite Ilana and escape. Very slowly she transforms into the creature and attacks an alligator that was also mutated. Lance and Octus kill the original Mutraddi beast, turning Ilana back to herself.

| ShortSummary = As the world seems to come to an absolute standstill, Octus remains immune and tries to find the cause for the problem. He is also forced to figure out what exactly he is. Once Octus finds the source, a giant bat Mutraddi that uses radio waves to stop all organic beings from moving, he attacks it, freeing Lance and Ilana. Now free, they form Sym-Bionic Titan with Octus and easily destroy the beast.

Ilana attends the opening of a school in a tribal region of Galaluna with her guardian, Hobbes. Meanwhile, Lance goes on a mission to rescue hostages from an observatory. His commander tells him to return to his post, but sneaks into the observatory as the Mudtradi Leader was talking to Modula (unbeknownst to Lance) and Lance was imprisoned for getting the hostages killed (even though they were beforehand). Meanwhile, the King is seen finishing building Octus. The invasion occurs and Hobbes is injured and returns Ilana to the palace with both of them alive, and Lance's commander is revealed to be a traitor for Modula. Lance kills his former commander after a long sword fight and events lead up to how the trio arrived on [[Earth|planet Earth]] in the first episode.

| ShortSummary = Ilana is homesick, so she joins the Homecoming Dance Committee and creates a Galalunian-themed dance. Meanwhile, General Modula's continued failure to destroy the princess is spreading across the galaxy. Modula is approached by an alien who guarantees on his own life that he has a creature that will destroy Ilana and crush the Galalunian People's spirit. As our three heroes try to prepare for the dance, Lance and Kristin go a little further in their romantic relationship with a karate bout, but she declines his request to join him at the dance. Issues arise when the creature arrives just as they are about to depart for the dance. Titan at first fails poorly, as Octus and Ilana are distracted by missing the dance and making Kimmy feeling guilty and upset. However, Lance's lack of concern for their feelings pushes Ilana and Octus over the top, and the creature is soundly defeated as a result of their frustration. Later, Kimmy, fed up with Octus' "bathroom" disappearances, breaks up with him, while Ilana and Lance share a dance under the spotlight, their dates having run off together. Modula, after destroying the alien, continues plotting a way to destroy Ilana once and for all.

| ShortSummary = Solomon and his team land at a heavily damaged space station when they are attacked by a burst of energy. Meanwhile, Octus is thrown a surprise birthday party by Lance and Ilana. During the party, Octus receives a distressing call from Solomon that requires Titan's immediate assistance. Titan arrives at the space station and are able to survive one encounter with the creature thanks to Solomon. He explains it is a creature made of pure [[lightning]]-like electrical energy and when it drains the energy of something, it cannot be recharged again. As they flee from the creature, Octus is hit by the creature in his leg, and cannot fix it. The gang then decide to contain the creature instead of destroying it. Lance and Solomon head towards the creature while Octus and Ilana hide. They manage to trap the creature temporarily, until Solomon's ship arrives. All of them escape, except for Lance due to the cable breaking. Octus saves him but is drained by the creature. When they try to recharge his mainframe it fails, and a strongly infuriated and heartbroken Lance uses Solomon's ship to destroy the station and the extraterrestrial creature within.

General Steel reveals a giant robot named The "Homeland Mobile Emergency Robot" HMER (nicknamed the Hammer); constructed from the metal scraps of the gigantic rocket that Tashy was sent to Earth in; which he uses to defeat the creature. Lance believes that if they can sneak into the army base with the recharge unit for The Hammer, they will have enough energy and power to reboot Octus, but they are discovered and find themselves fighting the army and the Hammer. Without the intense energy and abilities of Titan, they are both easily overwhelmed.

'''''The Marrow Thieves''''' is a [[young adult literature|young adult novel]] by [[Canada|Canadian]] writer [[Cherie Dimaline]], published in 2017 by [[Cormorant Books]] through its Dancing Cat Books imprint.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/cherie-dimaline-my-community-is-where-my-stories-come-fromand-its-also-where-my-responsibilities-lie/article35509226/ "Cherie Dimaline: ‘My community is where my stories come from and it’s also where my responsibilities lie’"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', June 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Told in the voice of teenage boy and archetypal reluctant hero Frenchie, the story is set in a dystopian future in which people have lost the ability to dream, with catastrophic psychological results. Indigenous people, who can still dream, are hunted for their marrow to create a serum to treat others.

==Awards==
The novel won the [[Governor General's Award for English-language children's literature]] at the [[2017 Governor General's Awards]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/governor-general-literary-awards-winners-2017-1.4381577 "Governor General Literary Awards announced: Joel Thomas Hynes wins top English fiction prize"].

[[CBC Books]], November 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the books competing in CBC's 2018 [[Canada Reads]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/books/canadareads/meet-the-canada-reads-2018-contenders-1.4505780 |title=Meet the Canada Reads 2018 contenders |work=CBC Books |date=January 30, 2018 |accessdate=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
For ''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]'', Jessica Rose wrote that Dimaline's book "thrusts readers into the complex lives of rich and nuanced characters forced to navigate a world that too closely resembles our own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quillandquire.com/review/the-marrow-thieves/|title=The Marrow Thieves|last=Rose|first=Jessica|date=August 14, 2017|publisher=''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' praised the book for its "tremendous emotional depth and tenderness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/cherie-dimaline/the-marrow-thieves/|title=THE MARROW THIEVES by Cherie Dimaline|publisher=''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''|date=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Shannon Ozirny wrote that "Dimaline takes one of the most well-known tropes in YA – the dystopia – and uses it to draw explicit parallels between the imagined horrors of a fictional future and the true historical horrors of colonialism and residential schools" and called the book "beautifully written as it is shocking and painful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/book-reviews/review-heather-smiths-the-agony-of-bun-okeefe-cherie-dimalines-the-marrow-thieves-and-sk-alis-saints-and-misfits/article36363655/|title=Review: Heather Smith's The Agony of Bun O'Keefe, Cherie Dimaline's The Marrow Thieves and S.K.

'''Tritik''' stitching is a small running line of [[Stitch (textile arts)|stitching]] that is gathered tightly. It is often used in [[African textiles]] and the designs are much bolder than in most other forms of stitching. This type of stitching is mostly found in Africa. It also played an important role in [[tie-dye]]ing.

'''''Ultime grida dalla savana''''' ({{literal translation|'''''Final Cry of the Savanna'''''}}), also known as by its English title '''''Savage Man Savage Beast''''', is a 1975 [[Mondo film|mondo]] [[documentary film]] co-produced, co-written, co-edited and co-directed by [[Antonio Climati]] and [[Mario Morra]]. Filmed all around the world, its central theme focuses on hunting and the interaction between man and animal. Like many mondo films, the filmmakers claim to document real, bizarre and violent behavior and customs, although some scenes were actually staged.&lt;ref&gt;Kerekes pp. 127–130&lt;/ref&gt; It is narrated by the Italian actor and popular dubber [[Giuseppe Rinaldi]] and the text was written by Italian novelist [[Alberto Moravia]].

This was the first film of Climati's and Morra's [[Mondo film#The Savage Trilogy|Savage Trilogy]], which also includes ''[[Savana violenta]]'' (''This Violent World'') and ''[[Dolce e selvaggio]]'' (''Sweet and Savage''). Arguably the most infamous film of the trilogy, ''Ultime grida dalla savana'' became influential in [[exploitation film|exploitation cinema]] by use of cinematographic techniques that were repeated in numerous subsequent Mondo films.&lt;ref&gt;Goodall pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt; Two scenes in particular, a lion attack on a tourist in [[Namibia]] and the murder of an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous man]] by a group of mercenaries in South America, have gained notoriety as genuine footage of human death. The film also sparked a rivalry between the team of Climati and Morra and the brothers Alfredo and Angelo Castiglioni. These two teams became the forerunners of the second generation of mondo cinema.&lt;ref&gt;Kerekes p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The film is a depiction of various scenes, usually violent or bizarre, that somehow relate to hunting. Each scenario is presented one after the other with little regard for [[continuity editing|narrative continuity]].&lt;ref name="Goodall1"&gt;Goodall p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The opening scene introduces a [[Patagonia]]n hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads. Afterwards, one of the numerous scenes of anti-hunting gatherings is shown, this one in [[Cape Cod]]. The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then a [[common squirrel monkey|squirrel monkey]] by an [[anaconda]]. The theme changes again to the [[pack hunter|social hunt]] of wild game in Australia and Africa. [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] hunt kangaroos and other large [[marsupials]] with spears and giant bats with [[boomerangs]]. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including [[antelope]], [[African buffalo|buffalo]], and [[African bush elephant|elephants]], in the [[savanna]]. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem [[cannibalism]] of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead.

Other hunting traditions then follow, again rooted in religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act in which they [[copulation|copulate]] with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient [[pagan]] beliefs of the [[Gauls]], is blessed by a [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and ultimately kill a fleeing stag. In a [[fox hunt]], the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an [[Afghan hound]] in [[estrous cycle|heat]]. Their efforts are then connected to [[conservation movement|species conservation]], and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, [[Argentina|Argentine]] hunters capture an [[Andean condor]] to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of [[white rhinoceros]]es, [[grizzly bears]] and elephants, which are shot with [[morphine]] darts. [[Hippocamelus|Argentinian deer]] and [[elephant seals]] are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on [[Safari|Africans safaris]] then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named [[Pit Dernitz]] by lions.

Another anti-hunting demonstration becomes the film's focus, this time on the [[Isle of Wight]]. Nudity and intercourse are practiced freely amongst the demonstrators, and this is contrasted with ancient hunter-gathering groups, who had strict rules concerning nudity. The narrator argues that once hunting had left this group of people, so did their rules toward nudity. Also highlighted is the contradiction that though this people are against hunting, thousands of farm-raised animals had to die to support them. The focus changes to [[Humboldt penguin]]s, which cannot hunt because of polluted waters, and thus seem detached and without focus. This effect is compared to modern day [[Eskimo]]s, who no longer hunt since the discovery of oil in their homeland and have fallen into depression and melancholy. To reverse the process, several groups of men go out and revive their hunting ways. Reflected in this is a montage of gun ownership, which the film relates to feelings of masculinity, followed by shots of illegal elephant poaching from Africa. To offset the dwindling number of game due to poaching, warriors from the Lobi tribe celebrate the "Ceremony of Life", in which they [[masturbation|masturbate]] with ceremonial rods and pour the product into the river, hoping the animals will drink the semen and multiply. Attention shifts to large electronic probes in the Peruvian savanna used to measure the winds of [[El Niño]] for optimal fishing conditions. Fishing birds are also electronically tagged so the prime fishing areas can be located based on the birds' fishing habits. This fish frenzy in South America is reflected in the [[salmon run]] in Alaska, where [[kodiak bear]]s hunt and fight for prey.

An examination of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and [[pheasant]]s. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, this time with cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged, in which the birds are hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd. In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active, but the prey has changed. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indios]] also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, castrate and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which [[orangutan]]s are hunted to be sold to zoos. The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik Zimen, an ecologist, and wolves, the group of animals he wishes to save.

== Production ==
=== Direction ===
As their former cinematographer, Climati drew influence from the Mondo films of [[Gualtiero Jacopetti]] and Franco Prosperi. The ''[[cinéma vérité]]'' styled camera work used in ''Ultime grida dalla savana'' was previously used in ''Africa addio'' in a scene in which the film crew is nearly killed during an uprising in newly independent [[Ethiopia]]. The inclusion of lingering Technicolor shots and violence towards animals is also a feature of Jacopetti's ''[[Mondo cane]]'' series. Some scenes were also directly lifted from ''Africa addio'' and reused in ''Ultime grida dalla savana.''&lt;ref name="Goodall1" /&gt; David Kerekes and David Slater, authors of ''Killing for Culture: An Illustrated History of Death Film from Mondo to Snuff'', also note that, "''Savage Man Savage Beast'' is a slight return to the more encyclopaedic world view of mondo cinema which was prevalent in the 60s," demonstrating Climati's early roots in Mondo cinema.&lt;ref name="Kerekes" /&gt;

=== Music ===
The songs and musical score used in the film were composed and written by Carlo Savina and Gilbert Kaplan. The songs were sung by Kaplan and Ann Collin. The music resembles Riz Ortolani's score from ''Africa addio'', as most tracks are of a light and upbeat nature, particularly during the opening and closing credits. The arrangement of music to enhance atmosphere and create comic effect also mimics the compositions in ''Africa addio''.&lt;ref name="Goodall1" /&gt;

== Reaction ==
The film was released in Italy on 24 October 1975, and internationally in 1976. The film fared well in Asia; in 1976, ''Ultime grida dalla savana'' was outgrossed in [[Hong Kong]] only by ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.&lt;ref name="Goodall2"&gt;Goodall p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, reception to the film from mainstream movie critics is almost completely negative, although it is well accepted by critics in [[exploitation film]] circles: Mark Goodall calls the film a "remarkable, pseudo-philosophical mondo examination of hunting fixated on the cyclical,  the (inter)relationship of the hunter and the hunted",&lt;ref name="Goodall2" /&gt; and Kerekes &amp; Slater also comment that it was, "The success of ''Savage Man... Savage Beast'' [that] inaugurated the 'savage' trilogy."&lt;ref&gt;Kerekes p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The content of the film, particularly the graphic violence and human death, has been criticized as too explicit and exploitative. Robert Firsching of [[Allmovie]] states: {{Quote|The reason for the film's notoriety, however, is a collection of grainy 16 mm images depicting the horrific round-up, mutilation, castration, and slaughter of a group of tribesmen by white mercenaries. As appalling and revolting a sequence as ever depicted in a documentary film, the massacre footage marked something of a turning point in the development of the mondo subgenre, which moved increasingly toward snuff-like collections of death and mutilation.&lt;ref name="AllMovie" /&gt;}}
''Time Out Film Guide'' made similar criticisms of the film's content, calling it "[a] bloody, blatantly exploitative mess of a movie", and says it is "just another opportunity to gawp at raw scenes of sex and (more especially) violence".&lt;ref name="TimeOut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/74046/Savage_Man_Savage_Beast.html |title=Savage Man... Savage Beast movie review |author=J. Py |publisher=Time Out New York |accessdate=2007-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430030915/http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/74046/Savage_Man_Savage_Beast.html |archivedate=2008-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its graphic content, the film was also used by [[James Ferman]] at the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] as an example of the need for film censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Kerekes p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of several staged or scripted scenes has made the film a target for critical condemnation. Numerous scenes have been proven fake, including the anti-fox hunting campaign involving the fictional "Wild Fox Association" and the murder of the indigenous men by mercenaries. During another wildlife rally, the fabrication of the scene is apparent with the presence of Italian porn star [[Ilona Staller]]. The lion attack on Pit Dernitz is also suspected of being a fabrication by film historians.&lt;ref&gt;Goodall pp. 108, 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerekes p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Although staged footage has been included since the early history of Mondo cinema, these scenes are nonetheless targets for critical abashment. Kerekes and Slater call the anti-fox hunt sequence "self-parody",&lt;ref name="Kerekes"&gt;Kerekes p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; and Goodall labels the same scene as "ludicrous".&lt;ref name="Goodall1" /&gt; The staged scenes of human death have also been criticized for being more exploitative than educational. Aside from his criticism of the film's staged footage, Goodall also points out the reuse of sequences of African tribal hunting and poaching from ''Africa addio'' as a flaw of the film.&lt;ref name="Goodall1" /&gt;

== Controversy ==
[[Image:Lion attack ultimegrida.png|thumb|The death of Pitt Dernitz is one of the most frequently censored scenes from the film.]]
Due to its graphic content, ''Ultime grida dalla savana'' has encountered censorship issues with certain countries' film boards. In Australia, the [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] (OFLC) banned both an uncut and cut version of the film in 1976. An appeal filed later that year was denied. Ten years later, the [[home video]] distributor Palace Video brought the same cut print before the film board and it received an R18+ rating. The cuts include segments from the lion attack, the torture and murder of the indigenous man by mercenaries, the death of a fox by a pack of hounds, and the death of a stag by a hunter in the opening scene.&lt;ref name="Refused"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.refused-classification.com/Films_S.htm#Savage%20Man,%20Savage%20Beast | title=Film S | publisher=Refused-Classification.com | accessdate=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film faced similar censorship problems for its theatrical release in the [[United Kingdom]], where it was released as ''Zumbalah''. In 1976, nearly 10 minutes were cut before it was passed with an X-rating by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC). Various scenes of animal cruelty, a race between cheetahs and ostriches, the lion attack, and the mercenaries' hunt of Amazonian natives were all cut from the British release.&lt;ref name="BBFC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/F60C3C105797AE96802566C800557149?OpenDocument |title=Savage Man&amp;nbsp;- Savage Beast rated X by the BBFC |publisher=British Board of Film Classification |accessdate=2007-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325110102/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/F60C3C105797AE96802566C800557149?OpenDocument |archivedate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes of animal cruelty were targeted by the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (RSPCA) to be cut from the film, specifically the hunt and disembowelment of a puma. Also in 1976, the [[Valtion elokuvatarkastamo]], the Finnish film classification board, banned the film in [[Finland]] in its entirety for the inclusion of scenes of genuine human death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://195.197.150.133/elokuvahaku/EH1210.aspx?ID=1181&amp;lcid=1035 |title=VET&amp;nbsp;- Elokuvahaku |publisher=[[Valtion elokuvatarkastamo]] |accessdate=2007-11-09 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
The release of ''Ultime grida dalla savana'' initiated a rivalry between Climati and Morra and two other Italian Mondo film makers, [[Mondo film#Castiglioni Brothers|Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni]]. These two filmmaking teams became the frontrunners of the Mondo genre in the late seventies and early eighties.&lt;ref&gt;Kerekes p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The Castiglionis had made two previous Mondo films, ''Africa segreta'' and ''Africa ama'', before the release of ''Ultime grida dalla savana''. They later released three additional films: ''Magia nuda'' in 1975, ''Addio ultimo uomo'' in 1978, ''Africa dolce e selvaggio'' in 1982. Climati and Morra made two follow-up films to ''Ultime grida dalla savana''. The first followup, ''[[Savana violenta]]'', also known as ''Savage Man Savage Beast no. 2'', was released in 1976. ''Savana violenta'' was slightly less graphic in its depiction of violence.&lt;ref name="AllMovie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodall pp. 115, 119&lt;/ref&gt; The last film, ''[[Dolce e selvaggio]]'', was released in 1983 and consisted partly of outtakes and recycled footage from Climati and Morra's two previous films. Each subsequent release by the two parties would attempt to outperform the previous films with more explicit and shocking content.

The scenes of human death, which were shot in a manner that resembled an observational documentary, became influential in exploitation cinema, as several subsequent films would use similar filming techniques to lend certain scenes a sense of increased realism. The Mondo film ''Addio ultimo uomo'', directed by the brothers Angelo and Alfredo Castiglioni, includes a scene of "amateur footage" that mimics the scene in which mercenaries hunt natives in ''Ultime grida dalla savana''. This scene, in which an African bushman is captured, tortured, and castrated by a rival tribe, has also been proven staged.&lt;ref&gt;Kerekes p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Again in 1978, the death film ''[[Faces of Death]]'' included fabricated "amateur footage" that is a reenactment of the death of Pit Dernitz, replacing lions with a bear.&lt;ref&gt;Brottman p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Firsching and Goodall also note that ''Ultime grida dalla savana'' was a transitional film within the genre,&lt;ref name="AllMovie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wc04.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:245084~T1 |title=Ultime Grida dalla Savana &gt; Review |author=Robert Firsching |publisher=All Media Guide |accessdate=2007-10-04 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; as it, "provided a vital link between the 'classic' shockumentaries of the early-mid 1960s and the much crueller mondos of the mid 1970s and beyond."&lt;ref name="Goodall2" /&gt; 

Director [[Ruggero Deodato]] also used this camera style prolifically in his film ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', in which a group of filmmakers goes missing after they head into the South American rain forest to make a documentary on local cannibal tribes. In the film, only the team's footage is recovered, which is all shot in the ''cinéma vérité'' style that resembles the "amateur footage" in ''Ultime grida dalla savana''.&lt;ref&gt;Goodall p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The footage from ''Cannibal Holocaust'' proved so realistic that Deodato was arrested for making a [[snuff film]]. Charges were ultimately dropped when he produced the supposedly slain actors for the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Ruggero Deodato (interviewee) |date=2003 |title=In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust |medium=Documentary |location=Italy |publisher=Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]]; [[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |location=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Extras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ziyuan''''' ({{zh|c=字苑|p=''Zìyuàn''| w=''Tzu-yüan''|l=Character Garden}}; or "Essays on Chinese Characters") was a [[Chinese dictionary]] attributed to the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] scholar [[Ge Hong]]. The original text was lost, and the small modern ''Ziyuan'' [[recension]] has 34 headwords, mostly [[Chinese Buddhist]] [[loanword]] terminology. 

The ''Ziyuan'' is notable for having the first occurrence of the Chinese borrowing ''ta'' ([[Wikt:塔|塔]]; ''tǎ''; ''t'a''; "tower; [[pagoda]]"). Feng (2004:205) classifies ''ta'' as a "monosyllabic phonemic loanword," and notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;塔/''ta''/=浮屠/''futu''/=浮图/''futu''/=佛图/''futu''/=数斗波/''shudoupo''/=兜婆/''doupo''/：Buddhist tower: "塔,佛堂也 [The ''ta'' is Buddhist tower]" (字苑), "作九层浮图 To build the Buddhist tower with nine levels" (水经注), "塔亦胡言, 犹宗庙也. [''ta'' comes from languages of Hu nationalities, it means tower.]" (魏书). It was borrowed from ''buddhastupa'' of Sanskrit. The process of pronunciation change is as follows: ''Buddhastupa'' ''stupa'' ''tupa'' ''t’ap''. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
