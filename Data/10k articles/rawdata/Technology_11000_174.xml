'''Aeration''' (also called '''aerification''' or '''aeriation''') is the [[Systems engineering process|process]] by which [[air]] is circulated through, mixed with or [[solvation|dissolved]] in a [[liquid]] or substance.

==Aeration of liquids==
===Methods===
Aeration of liquids (usually water) is achieved by:
* passing the liquid through air by means of [[fountain]]s, [[Waterfall|cascades]], paddle-wheels or cones.
* passing air through the liquid by means of the [[Venturi tube]], [[Aeration Turbine|aeration turbines]] or [[compressed air]] which can be combined with diffuser(s) air stone(s), as well as [[fine bubble diffusers]], [[coarse bubble diffusers]] or linear aeration tubing. Ceramics are suitable for this purpose, often involving dispersion of fine air or gas bubbles through the porous ceramic into a liquid. The smaller the bubbles, the more gas is exposed to the liquid increasing the gas transfer efficiency. Diffusers or [[sparger]]s can also be designed into the system to cause turbulence or mixing if desired. 

Porous ceramic diffusers are made by fusing aluminum oxide grains using porcelain bonds to form a strong, uniformly porous and homogeneous structure. The naturally hydrophilic material is easily wetted resulting in the production of fine, uniform bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refractron.com/diffusion_sparging_aeration.asp Porous Ceramic Diffusers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930054204/http://www.refractron.com/diffusion_sparging_aeration.asp |date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a given volume of air or liquid, the [[surface area]] changes proportionally with drop or bubble size, the very surface area where exchange can occur. Utilizing extremely small bubbles or drops increases the rate of [[gas transfer]] (aeration) due to the higher contact surface area. The pores which these bubbles pass through are generally micrometre-size.

===Uses of aeration of liquids===
[[File:Aerated tap water.jpg|thumb|right|Aerated tap water]]
* To smooth ([[Laminar flow|laminate]]) the flow of tap water at the faucet.
* Production of [[aerated water]] or [[cola]] for drinking purposes.
* Secondary treatment of [[sewage]] or industrial [[wastewater]] through use of aerating mixers/[[Diffuser (sewage)|diffusers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AERATION|url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/AERATION/aeration.htm|accessdate=18 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225024355/http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/AERATION/aeration.htm|archive-date=2014-02-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aeration Device|url=http://fortransaeration.com/new-aeration-device-works-better/|publisher=Fortrans|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To increase the [[oxygen]] content of water used to house animals, such as [[fishkeeping|aquarium fish]] or [[fish farm]]
* To increase oxygen content of [[wort]] (unfermented beer) or [[must]] (unfermented wine) to allow yeast to propagate and begin [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]].
* To dispel other dissolved gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] or [[chlorine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swistock|first1=Bryan|title=Methane Gas and Its Removal from Wells in Pennsylvania|url=http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/water/drinking-water/water-testing/pollutants/methane-gas-and-its-removal-from-wells-in-pennsylvania|publisher=PSU|accessdate=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In chemistry, to oxidise a compound dissolved or suspended in water.
* To induce mixing of a body of otherwise still water.

==Aeration of soil ==
[[File:Plug Aerator.jpg|thumb|[[Lawn aerator|Plug/core lawn aerator]]]]
In soil, aeration refers to the extent of [[Porosity#Porosity of soil|air gaps]].

Soil aeration is the process of using mechanized or manual equipment to either puncture the soil with spikes (spike aeration) or remove approximately 1" x 2" cores of soil from the ground (core aeration). Aeration may be overlooked when trying to restore a [[lawn]] but is vital to bring it back to health. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} It improves drainage and reduces puddles formation. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Spike aeration involves the use of an [[Lawn aerator|aeration machine]] with spikes up to a foot or more in length. It is sometimes used to address drainage issues in areas with [[turf]]. Core aeration is done on turf areas as a means of reducing [[turf compaction]], reducing thatch buildup, improving the infiltration of water/nutrients, encouraging deeper roots, and creating an environment where grass seed can have direct contact with the soil. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

There are many types of [[lawn aerator]]s including walk behind models, ride on versions and tractor pulled versions, as well as spiked shoes.

==Aeration in food==
Refers to the process in which air is absorbed into the food item. It refers to the lightness of cakes and bread, as measured by the type of [[Pores (bread)|pores]] they contain, and the color and texture of some sauces which have incorporated air bubbles.

In [[wine tasting]], a variety of methods are used to aerate wine and bring out the aromas including [[wine swirling|swirl]] wine in the glass, use of a [[decanter]] to increase exposure to air, or a specialized [[wine aerator]].

Cider from [[Asturias]] is poured into the glass from a height of about 1 metre (''el escanciado'') to increase aeration.

'''AirNav RadarBox''' is a Windows PC software and hardware package which allows appropriately equipped aircraft to be seen on a simulated [[radar]] screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://monitoringtimes.com/mtrevuoct07.pdf |issue=October 2007 |title=RadarBox by AirNav Systems Review: Decoding the New ADS-B Aircraft Communications System |first=John |last=Catalano |journal=Monitoring Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avsim.com/pages/0910/AirNav/RadarBox.html |date=26 September 2010 |title= AirNav RadarBox Pro |first=Marlon |last=Carter |work=AVSIM Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightsim.com/vbfs/content.php?9926-Released-AirNav-RadarBox-3D |date=25 February 2010 |title=Released - AirNav RadarBox 3D |work=FlightSim.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A small receiver connects to the PC via [[USB]] and aircraft are detected using the small supplied antenna.  By decoding [[ADS-B]] (Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast) transmissions from aircraft, those aircraft are displayed on a computer in a similar display to that used by [[Air Traffic Control]]. Flight number, aircraft type, altitude, heading, speed are visible and updated every second. The RadarBox system can be used at any location, either as a stand-alone system, or connected to the [[Internet]] which allows additional functions. An internal map database provides 3D multi-window maps with worldwide coverage and geographic points which include airports, runways, [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]], [[Non-directional beacon|NDB]], Fixes, cities, roads, airways and elevation data.

When the PC running the RadarBox software is connected to the [[Internet]], the RadarBox [[telecommunications network|Network]] function is available.  This allows viewing of data received by other RadarBox users all over the world.  Network data is delayed by 5 minutes by default, but real-time Network data is also available.

== RadarBox24.com ==

RadarBox24.com is a website showing AirNav RadarBox and other receivers data in real-time from all over the world.
AirNav Systems has released iOS and Android mobile apps.

== Screen Display - User Interface==

The screen consists of two major sections, the "radar" map and the tabbed information area.  The map can be scrolled and zoomed using the mouse to view any area on the Earth's surface. Aircraft symbols and associated data blocks show flight information which includes aircraft type, registration and altitude. The information area allows viewing of aircraft lists for both live and network aircraft and gives access to other functions which include Alerting and Fleetwatch displays.

== Radarbox 3D==
RadarBox is also optionally available with a 3D and 2D map display based on Google Earth mapping.

}}  "An antipattern is just like a pattern, except that instead of a solution it gives something that looks superficially like a solution, but isn't one."&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by a book, ''[[Design Patterns (book)|Design Patterns]]'', which highlights a number of [[design pattern]]s in [[software development]] that its authors considered to be highly reliable and effective.

The term was popularized three years later by the book ''[[AntiPatterns]]'', which extended its use beyond the field of software design to refer informally to any commonly reinvented but bad solution to a problem. Examples include [[analysis paralysis]], [[cargo cult programming]], [[death march (software development)|death march]], [[groupthink]] and [[vendor lock-in]].

== Definition ==
According to the authors of ''Design Patterns'', there must be at least two key elements present to formally distinguish an actual anti-pattern from a simple bad habit, bad practice, or bad idea:

# A commonly used process, structure, or pattern of action that despite initially appearing to be an appropriate and effective response to a problem, has more bad consequences than good ones.
# Another solution exists that is documented, repeatable, and proven to be effective.

I wonder if these patterns are not sometimes evidence of case (c), the human compiler, at work. When I see patterns in my programs, I consider it a sign of trouble. The shape of a program should reflect only the problem it needs to solve. Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at least, that I'm using abstractions that aren't powerful enough— often that I'm generating by hand the expansions of some macro that I need to write.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Error hiding]]: Catching an error message before it can be shown to the user and either showing nothing or showing a meaningless message. This anti-pattern is also named ''Diaper Pattern''. Also can refer to erasing the [[Stack trace]] during exception handling, which can hamper debugging.

Over the last two centuries many environmental '''chemical observations''' have been made from a variety of ground-based, [[aircraft|airborne]], and [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]] platforms and deposited in [[databases]].  Many of these [[databases]] are publicly available. All of the instruments mentioned in this article give online public access to their data. These observations are critical in developing our understanding of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and issues such as [[climate change]], [[ozone depletion]] and [[air quality]]. Some of the external links provide repositories of many of these datasets in one place. For example, the Cambridge Atmospheric Chemical Database, is a large [[database]] in a uniform [[ASCII]] format. Each observation is augmented with the meteorological conditions such as the [[temperature]], [[potential temperature]], [[geopotential height]], and equivalent [[Potential vorticity|PV]] latitude.

==Ground-based and balloon observations==
* '''NDSC observations'''. The [http://www.ndsc.ncep.noaa.gov/ Network for the Detection for Stratospheric Change] (NDSC) is a set of high-quality remote-sounding research stations for observing and understanding the physical and chemical state of the stratosphere. Ozone and key ozone-related chemical compounds and parameters are targeted for measurement. The NDSC is a major component of the international upper atmosphere research effort and has been endorsed by national and international scientific agencies, including the International Ozone Commission, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The primary instruments and measurements are: Ozone lidar (vertical profiles of ozone from the tropopause to at least 40&amp;nbsp;km altitude; in some cases tropospheric ozone will also be measured). Temperature lidar (vertical profiles of temperature from about 30 to 80&amp;nbsp;km). Aerosol lidar (vertical profiles of aerosol optical depth in the lower stratosphere). Water vapor  lidar (vertical profiles of water vapor in the lower stratosphere). Ozone microwave (vertical profiles of stratospheric ozone from 20 to 70&amp;nbsp;km). H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O microwave (vertical profiles water vapor from about 20 to 80&amp;nbsp;km). ClO microwave (vertical profiles of ClO from about 25 to 45&amp;nbsp;km, depending on latitude). Ultraviolet/Visible spectrograph (column abundance of ozone, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and, at some latitudes, OClO and BrO). Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (column abundances of a broad range of species including ozone, HCl, NO, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ClONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).
* '''MkIV observations'''. The [http://mark4sun.jpl.nasa.gov/ MkIV] Interferometer is a Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectrometer, designed and built at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in 1984, to remotely sense the composition of the Earth's atmosphere by the technique of solar absorption spectrometry. This was born out of concern that man-made pollutants (e.g. chlorofluorocarbons, aircraft exhaust) might perturb the ozone layer. Since 1984, the MkIV Interferometer has participated in 3 NASA DC-8 polar aircraft campaigns, and has successfully completed 15 balloon flights. In addition, the MkIV Interferometer made over 900 days of ground-based observations from many different locations, including [[McMurdo Station|McMurdo]], [[Antarctica]] in 1986.
* '''Sonde observations'''. The [http://www.woudc.org/index_e.html World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre] (WOUDC) is one of five World Data Centres which are part of the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO). The WOUDC is operated by the Experimental Studies Division of the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) — formerly Atmospheric Environment Service (AES), Environment Canada and is located in Toronto. The WOUDC began as the World Ozone Data Centre (WODC) in 1960 and produced its first data publication of Ozone Data for the World in 1964. In June 1992, the AES agreed to a request from the WMO to add ultraviolet radiation data to the WODC. The Data Centre has since been renamed to the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) with the two component parts: the WODC and the World Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WUDC).

==Airborne observations==
* '''Aircraft observations'''. Many aircraft campaigns have been conducted as part of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070214031222/http://suborbital.nasa.gov/ Suborbital Science Program] and by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060930215700/http://www.espo.nasa.gov/project/mission2.html Earth Science Project Office] an overview of these campaigns is available. The data can be accessed from the Earth Science Project Office [http://espoarchive.nasa.gov/archive/arcs/ archives].
* '''MOZAIC observations'''. The [http://mozaic.aero.obs-mip.fr/web/ MOZAIC] program (Measurement of OZone and water vapour by AIrbus in-service airCraft) was initiated in 1993 by European scientists, aircraft manufacturers and airlines to collect experimental data. Its goal is to help understand the atmosphere and how it is changing under the influence of human activity, with particular interest in the effects of aircraft. MOZAIC consists of automatic and regular measurements of ozone and water vapour by five long range passenger airliners flying all over the world. The aim is to build a large database of measurements to allow studies of chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere, and hence to validate global chemistry transport models. MOZAIC data provide, in particular, detailed ozone and water vapour climatologies at 9–12&amp;nbsp;km where subsonic aircraft emit most of their exhaust and which is a very critical domain (e.g. radiatively and S/T exchanges) still imperfectly described in existing models. This will be valuable to improve knowledge about the processes occurring in the upper troposphere/ lower stratosphere (UT/LS), and the model treatment of near tropopause chemistry and transport. The MOZAIC data is restricted access, to obtain access the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070108203102/http://mozaic.aero.obs-mip.fr/web/features/database/access.html forms] need to be filled out.
* '''CARIBIC observations'''. The [http://www.caribic-atmospheric.com CARIBIC] (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) project is an innovative scientific project to study and monitor important chemical and physical processes in the Earth's atmosphere. Detailed and extensive measurements are made during long distance flights on board the [[Airbus]] [[A340-600]] "Leverkusen" (http://www.flightradar24.com/data/airplanes/D-AIHE/). We deploy an airfreight container with automated scientific apparatuses, which are connected to an air and particle (aerosol) inlet underneath the aircraft. In contrast to MOZAIC, CARIBIC is only installed on one aircraft, but it measures a much wider spectrum of atmospheric constituents ([http://www.caribic-atmospheric.com/ CARIBIC -&gt; instrumentation]). Both, CARIBIC and MOZAIC are integrated in [http://www.iagos.org IAGOS]. Data exist from 1998-2002 and from 2004-today. It can be requested via [http://www.caribic-atmospheric.com/ CARIBIC -&gt; data access].

==Space shuttle observations==
* '''ATMOS observations'''. The [http://remus.jpl.nasa.gov/atmos/atmos.html Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy] experiment (ATMOS) is an infrared spectrometer (a Fourier transform interferometer) that is designed to study the chemical composition of the atmosphere. In this section you will be able to read both general and detailed information as to why and how the instrument works. The ATMOS instrument has flown four times on the Space Shuttle since 1985. The predecessor to ATMOS, flown on aircraft and high-altitude balloon platforms, was born in the early 1970s out of concern for the effects of Super Sonic Transport exhaust products on the ozone layer. The experiment was redesigned for the Space Shuttle when the potential for ozone destruction by man-made chlorofluorocarbons was discovered and the need for global measurements became crucial.
* '''CRISTA observations'''. [https://archive.is/20011201094454/http://www.crista.uni-wuppertal.de/introduction.shtml CRISTA] is short for CRyogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere. It is a limb-scanning satellite experiment, designed and developed by the University of Wuppertal to measure infrared emissions of the Earth's atmosphere. Equipped with three telescopes and four spectrometers and cooled with liquid helium, CRISTA acquires global maps of temperature and atmospheric trace gases with very high horizontal and vertical resolution. The design enables the observation of small scale dynamical structures in the 15–150&amp;nbsp;km altitude region.

==Satellite observations==
* '''ACE observations'''. The [http://www.ace.uwaterloo.ca/ Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment] (ACE) satellite, also known as [[SCISAT-1]], is a Canadian satellite that makes measurements of the Earth's atmosphere and follows in heritage of ATMOS.
* '''[[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] observations'''. [http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/ Aura] flies in formation with the [[NASA]] [[Earth Observing System|EOS]] "A Train," a collection of several other satellites (Aqua, CALIPSO, CloudSat and the French PARASOL). Aura carries four instruments for studies of atmospheric chemistry: [[Microwave Limb Sounder|MLS]], HIRDLS, TES and OMI.
* '''ILAS observations'''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205195349/http://www-ilas.nies.go.jp/index.html ILAS] (Improved Limb Atmospheric Spectrometer) developed by MOE (the Ministry of the Environment) (formerly EA - Environment Agency of Japan) is boarded on ADEOS (Advanced Earth Observing Satellite). On August 17, 1996, ADEOS was launched by the H-II rocket from the Tanegashima Space Center of Japan (ADEOS was renamed as "MIDORI") and stopped its operation on June 30, 1997. Data obtained by ILAS are processed, archived, and distributed by NIES (National Institute for Environmental Studies).
* '''POAM observations'''. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070301180400/http://wvms.nrl.navy.mil/POAM/poam.html Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement] II (POAM II) instrument was developed by the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) to measure the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone, water vapor, nitrogen dioxide, aerosol extinction, and temperature. POAM II measures solar extinction in nine narrow band channels, covering the spectral range from approximately 350 to 1060&amp;nbsp;nm.
* '''Sulfate aerosol observations from SAGE and HALOE'''. The SAGE II (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II) sensor was launched into a 57 degree inclination orbit aboard the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) in October 1984. During each sunrise and sunset encountered by the orbiting spacecraft, the instrument uses the solar occultation technique to measure attenuated solar radiation through the Earth's limb in seven channels centered at wavelengths ranging from 0.385 to 1.02 micrometers. The retrieval of stratospheric aerosol size distributions based on HALOE multi-wavelength particle extinction measurements was described by Hervig et al. [1998].  That approach yields unimodal lognormal size distributions,  which describe the aerosol concentration versus radius using three parameters:  total aerosol concentration,  median radius,  and distribution width. This [https://web.archive.org/web/20061208105210/http://haloedata.larc.nasa.gov/home/index.php?p=noframe_home.html site] offers results based on the Hervig et al. [1998] technique,  with one exception.  The retrieval results reported here are based on sulfate refractive indices for 215 K,  where Hervig et al.  [1998] used room temperature indices adjusted to stratospheric temperatures using the Lorentz-Lorenz rule.  Size distributions were only retrieved at altitudes above tropospheric cloud tops. Clouds were identified using techniques described by Hervig and McHugh [1999].  The HALOE size distributions are offered in NetCDF files containing data for a single year.  The results are reported on a uniform altitude grid ranging from 6 to 33&amp;nbsp;km at 0.3&amp;nbsp;km spacing.  The native HALOE altitude spacing is 0.3&amp;nbsp;km,  so this interpolation has little or no effect on the data.  The files report profile data including: altitude, pressure, temperature, aerosol concentration, median radius, distribution width, aerosol composition. Aerosol surface area and volume densities can be easily calculated from the size distribution parameters using the relationships given [http://gwest.gats-inc.com/haloe_aerosols/HALOE_size_distribution_data.html here].
* '''[[Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite]]''' (UARS) observations. Data from the UARS is available from the [http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/ GES Distributed Active Archive Center] (DAAC). The UARS satellite was launched in 1991 by the Space Shuttle Discovery. It is {{convert|35|ft|m}} long, {{convert|15|ft|m}} in diameter, weighs 13,000 pounds, and carries 10 instruments. UARS orbits at an altitude of {{convert|375|mi|km}} with an orbital inclination of 57 degrees. UARS measured ozone and chemical compounds found in the ozone layer which affect ozone chemistry and processes. UARS also measured winds and temperatures in the stratosphere as well as the energy input from the Sun. Together, these helped define the role of the upper atmosphere in climate and climate variability.

* '''Surface [[albedo]]'''. The surface reflectivity is of importance for atmospheric [[photolysis]]. Instruments such as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070213005923/http://toms.gsfc.nasa.gov/reflect/reflect.html Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer] (TOMS) and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070128230043/http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/instruments/omi/index.html Ozone Monitoring Instrument] (OMI) provide daily global fields.

[[Image:Congrats bqt.jpg|thumb|Balloons are given for special occasions, such as birthdays or holidays, and are often used as party décor.]]
A '''balloon''' is a flexible bag that can be inflated with a gas, such as [[helium]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrous oxide]], [[oxygen]], [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] or [[water]]. Modern day balloons are made from materials such as [[Natural rubber|rubber]], [[latex]], [[Neoprene|polychloroprene]], or a [[nylon]] fabric, and can come in many different colors. Some early balloons were made of dried animal [[urinary bladder|bladder]]s, such as the [[pig bladder]]. Some balloons are used for decorative purposes or entertaining purposes, while others are used for practical purposes such as [[Weather balloon|meteorology]], [[Angioplasty|medical treatment]], [[Barrage balloon|military defense]], or [[Balloon (aeronautics)|transportation]]. A balloon's properties, including its low [[density]] and low cost, have led to a wide range of applications.

The rubber balloon was invented by Datboi in 1824, during experiments with various gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Swain, Heather|title=Make These Toys: 101 Clever Creations Using Everyday Items|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKPb1wtWg74C&amp;pg=PT15|date=2010|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-18873-6|pages=15–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127015616/https://books.google.com/books?id=IKPb1wtWg74C&amp;pg=PT15|archivedate=November 27, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
{{See also|List of balloon uses}}

===Decoration or entertainment===
{{Main|Toy balloon}}'''Balloon decorating'''
[[File:Giant Balloon Nutcracker Figures for Rays Game.jpg|thumb|Decorations made of balloons with a combination of stacking and twisting techniques showcasing the deco-twisting style.]]
Balloons are used for decorating birthday parties, weddings, corporate functions, school events, and for other festive gatherings. The artists who use the round balloons to build are called "stackers" and the artists who use pencil balloons to build are called "twisters." Most commonly associated with helium balloon decor, more recently balloon decorators have been moving towards the creation of air-filled balloon decorations due to the non-renewable natural resource of helium limited in supply. The most common types of balloon decor include arches, columns, centerpieces, balloon drops, sculptures, and balloon bouquets. With the increased aptitude for balloon twisting as well as balloon stacking, the rise of the deco-twister manifests itself as the combination of stacking techniques as well as twisting techniques to create unique and interesting balloon decor option.   [[Image:Parada Gay em Sampa.jpg|thumb|Decorative rainbow colored arches made of party balloons used at the [[Pride parade|gay pride parade]] in São Paulo, Brazil.]]
'''Party balloons''' are mostly made of a natural latex tapped from [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber trees]], and can be filled with air, helium, water, or any other suitable liquid or gas. The rubber's elasticity makes the volume adjustable.

 [[File:Dopey Balloon Twisting Table Centerpiece for Rays Draft Room.jpg|thumb|Twisting balloons can be used to create decor centerpieces for events and to create a more unique look than can be provided by foil balloons.]]Often the term "Party Balloon" will refer to a twisting balloon or pencil balloon. These balloons are manipulated to create shapes and figures for parties and events, typically along with entertainment.

Filling the balloon with air can be done with the mouth, a manual or electric inflater (such as a hand [[pump]]), or with a source of compressed gas.

When rubber or plastic balloons are filled with helium so that they float, they typically retain their [[buoyancy]] for only a day or so, sometimes longer. The enclosed [[helium atom]]s escape through small pores in the latex which are larger than the helium atoms. Balloons filled with air usually hold their size and shape much longer, sometimes for up to a week.

Even a perfect rubber balloon eventually loses gas to the outside. The process by which a substance or [[solution|solute]] migrates from a region of high concentration, through a barrier or membrane, to a region of lower concentration is called [[Molecular diffusion|diffusion]]. The inside of balloons can be treated with a special gel (for instance, the [[polymer]] solution sold under the "Hi Float" brand) which coats the inside of the balloon to reduce the helium leakage, thus increasing float time to a week or longer.

[[Image:Balloonsanimals.jpg|thumb|Animal-shaped balloons]]
Beginning in the late 1970s, some more expensive (and longer-lasting) foil balloons made of thin, unstretchable, less permeable [[metallised film]]s such as Mylar ([[BoPET]]) started being produced. These balloons have attractive shiny reflective surfaces and are often printed with color pictures and patterns for gifts and parties. The most important attribute of metallised nylon for balloons is its lightweight, increasing buoyancy and its ability to keep the helium gas from escaping for several weeks. Foil balloons have been criticized for interfering with [[Electric power transmission|power lines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/04/mylar-balloons.html "Metallic balloons spark controversy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721050712/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/04/mylar-balloons.html |date=July 21, 2012 }}.

====Modelling and use in art====
Balloon artists are entertainers who twist and tie inflated tubular balloons into sculptures (see [[balloon modelling]]). The balloons used for sculpture are made of extra-stretchy rubber so that they can be twisted and tied without bursting. Since the pressure required to inflate a balloon is [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the diameter of the balloon{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}, these tiny tubular balloons are extremely hard to inflate initially. A pump is usually used to inflate these balloons.

Decorators may use helium balloons to create balloon sculptures. Usually the round shape of the balloon restricts these to simple arches or walls, but on occasion more ambitious "sculptures" have been attempted. It is also common to use balloons as table decorations for celebratory events. Balloons can sometimes be modeled to form shapes of animals. Table decorations normally appear with three or five balloons on each bouquet. Ribbon is curled and added with a weight to keep the balloons from floating away.

====Drops and releases====
[[File:Units of Italy in Prato 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Party balloons in [[Italy]]]]
A decorative use for balloons is in balloon drops. In a balloon drop, a plastic bag or net filled with air-inflated balloons is suspended from a fixed height. Once released, the balloons fall onto their target area below. Balloon drops are commonly performed at [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations and at [[Demonstration (people)|political rallies]] and [[convention (meeting)|conventions]], but may also be performed at celebrations, including graduations and weddings.

For decades, people have also celebrated with [[balloon release]]s. This practice has been discouraged by the balloon industry, as it has posed problematic for the environment and cities. In recent years, legislation, such as the [[California Balloon Law]], has been enacted to enforce consumers and retailers to tether helium-filled foil ([[BoPET]]) balloons with a balloon weight. This ensures that the helium-filled balloons do not float into the atmosphere, which is both potentially injurious to animals, the environment, and power lines.  Many states now have banned balloon releases.

It is becoming more common for balloons to be filled with air instead of helium, as air-filled balloons will not release into the atmosphere or deplete the earthly helium supply.  There are numerous party games and school-related activities that can use air-filled balloons as opposed to helium balloons.  When age-appropriate, these activities often include the added fun of blowing the balloons up.  In many events, the balloons will contain prizes, and party-goers can pop the balloons to retrieve the items inside.

====Publicity use====
Balloons are used for publicity at major events. [[Screen printing]] processes can be used to print designs and company logos onto the balloons. Custom built printers inflate the balloon and apply ink with elastic qualities through a silk screen template. In January 2008, the [[Jewish Community Relations Council]] of New York organized a display of 4,200 red balloons outside the [[United Nations Headquarters]].&lt;ref name="Ynet"&gt;Sela, Neta (January 24, 2008) [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/1,7340,L-3498487,00.html 4,200 balloons released in NY to protest Qassam fire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628190524/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/1,7340,L-3498487,00.html |date=June 28, 2011 }}, Ynet News.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1950s at the start of the Cold War, activists in Western Europe uses balloons for propaganda purposes that would float east over Eastern Europe, which would release newspapers and pamphlets. Today, South Korean activists are using the same balloon method to get information to those in North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA110 "Target Satellite Europe."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127015616/https://books.google.com/books?id=SeEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA110 |date=November 27, 2017 }} ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1956, pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paolo Scannavino set the record of 11 for the most giant balloons entered in 2 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=2013 Guinness Book of World Records Limited|last=|first=|publisher=Craig Glenday|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=114|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water balloons====
{{Main|Water balloon}}
Water balloons are thin, small rubber balloons filled with a liquid, usually water, instead of a gas, and intended to be easily broken. They are usually used by children, who throw them at each other, trying to get each other wet, as a game, competition, or [[practical joke]]. By forcing water out the open end of a water balloon, it is possible to use it as a makeshift [[water gun]].

====Solar balloons====
{{Main|Solar balloon}}
Solar balloons are thin, large balloons filled with air that is heated by the sun in order to decrease its density to obtain lift.

====Balloon rockets====
{{Main|Balloon rocket}}
Balloons are often deliberately released, creating a so-called [[balloon rocket]]. Balloon rockets work because the elastic balloons contract on the air within them, and so when the mouth of the balloon is opened, the gas within the balloon is expelled out, and due to [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law of motion]], the balloon is propelled forward. This is the same way that a rocket works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://physics.about.com/od/classroomphysics/ss/balloonrocket_5.htm|title= Scientific Explanation: Why the Rocket Balloon Works|accessdate= April 29, 2007|last= Zimmerman Jones|first= Andrew|work= How to Create a Rocket Balloon|publisher= [[About.com|About:Physics]]|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070707061247/http://physics.about.com/od/classroomphysics/ss/balloonrocket_5.htm|archivedate= July 7, 2007|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flying machines===
[[Image:Luftballong.jpg|thumb|Hot air balloons, [[San Diego, California]]]]
{{Main|Balloon (aeronautics)}}
Balloons filled with hot air or a buoyant gas have been used as flying machines since the 18th century. The earliest flights were made with [[hot air balloon]]s using air heated with a flame, or hydrogen as the lifting gas. Later, coal gas and later still helium were used. An unpowered balloon travels with the wind. A balloon which has an engine to propel it is called a dirigible balloon or [[airship]].

===Medicine===
[[Angioplasty]] is a surgical procedure in which very small balloons are inserted into blocked or partially blocked [[blood vessel]]s near the heart. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to clear or compress [[Atheroma|arterial plaque]], and to stretch the walls of the vessel, thus preventing [[myocardial infarction]]. A small [[stent]] can be inserted at the angioplasty site to keep the vessel open after the balloon's removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002953.htm|title= Angioplasty|accessdate=April 28, 2007 |last= Berger|first= Alan|date= May 30, 2006|work= Medical Encyclopedia|publisher= MedlinePlus| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070509000218/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002953.htm| archivedate= May 9, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Balloon catheter]]s are [[catheter]]s that have balloons at their tip to keep them from slipping out. For example, the balloon of a [[Foley catheter]] is inflated when the catheter is inserted into the urinary bladder and secures its position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blcatheter.htm|title= History of the Catheter – Balloon Catheter – Thomas Fogarty|accessdate=April 28, 2007 |last= Bellis|first= Mary|work= About: Inventors|publisher= [[About.com|About]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insertion of balloons subsequently filled with air or liquid can be used to [[Balloon tamponade|stop bleeding]] in hollow internal organs such as [[stomach]] or [[uterus]].

==Safety and environmental concerns==
{{main|Marine debris}}
[[File:Slide3Chem.jpg|thumb|An illustration of the degradation of the latex polymer in aquatic environments]]
There has been some environmental concern over metallised nylon balloons, as they do not [[Biodegradation|biodegrade]] or shred as rubber balloons do. Release of these types of balloons into the atmosphere is considered harmful to the environment. This type of balloon can also conduct electricity on its surface and released foil balloons can become entangled in power lines and cause power outages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Haroutunian, Atineh |date=June 3, 2008 |url=http://www.glendalewaterandpower.com/news.aspx?item=40 |title=Mylar Balloons Spark Power Outages |publisher=Glendalewaterandpower.com |accessdate=September 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919051910/http://www.glendalewaterandpower.com/news.aspx?item=40 |archivedate=September 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released balloons can land anywhere, including on [[nature reserve]]s or other areas where they can pose a hazard to animals through ingestion or entanglement. Because of the potential harm to wildlife and the effect of litter on the environment, some jurisdictions even legislate to control mass balloon releases. Legislation proposed in [[Maryland]], US, was named after Inky, a pygmy [[sperm whale]] who needed six operations after swallowing debris, the largest piece of which was a Mylar balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MARP Sponsors Inky Legislation |url=http://www.aqua.org/oceanhealth_inkylegislation.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807124645/http://www.aqua.org/oceanhealth_inkylegislation.html |archivedate=August 7, 2008|publisher=[[National Aquarium in Baltimore]] | accessdate=December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.longwood.edu/cleanva/balloonlaws.htm | title=Legislation regulating the release of balloons |publisher=Clean Virginia Waterways |accessdate=December 1, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061125030027/http://www.longwood.edu/cleanva/balloonlaws.htm| archivedate= November 25, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, there is no documentary evidence to suggest that the death of any sea mammal has been attributed to foil balloons as a sole cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.balloonhq.com/BalloonCouncil/faq.html#sea | title=FAQ: Are sea mammals at risk? | publisher=The Balloon Council | accessdate=February 9, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310220832/http://www.balloonhq.com/BalloonCouncil/faq.html#sea | archivedate=March 10, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, foil balloons sold at major theme parks and zoos have balloon weights attached to help prevent accidental release into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.balloonsupply.co.uk/index.php?_a=viewDoc&amp;docId=22 | title=Environmental Policy Statement | publisher=Balloon Supply &amp; Distribution Ltd. | accessdate=February 9, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904230016/http://www.balloonsupply.co.uk/index.php?_a=viewDoc&amp;docId=22 | archivedate=September 4, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Andrady says that releases of latex balloons that descend into the sea pose a serious ingestion and/or entanglement hazard to [[marine biology|marine animals]] because balloons exposed floating in seawater deteriorate much more slowly than those exposed in air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://hawaiihumpbackwhale.noaa.gov/documents/pdfs_conferences/proceedings.pdf | first=A.L. | last=Andrady | date=August 6, 2000 | title=Plastics and Their Impacts in the Marine Environment | booktitle=Proceedings of the International Marine Debris Conference on Derelict Fishing Gear and the Ocean Environment | publisher=Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary | location=Hawaii | page=140 | accessdate=September 7, 2013 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102121328/http://hawaiihumpbackwhale.noaa.gov/documents/pdfs_conferences/proceedings.pdf | archivedate=November 2, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Balloon manufacturers will often state that a latex balloon is perfectly safe to release into the environment as it is made from a natural substance and will biodegrade over time. However, a latex balloon can take up to a year to degrade if it lands in the sea and during this time it is possible for a marine animal to ingest the balloon and die from slow starvation if its digestive system is blocked.

When balloons eventually return to the ground, they begin the degradation process. Latex balloons are the most used because of their ability to [[biodegrade]]. The problem with this is that it can take at least 4 weeks to show substantial degradation of the [[polymer]] in the environment, and around 6 months in aquatic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lambert|first1=S|last2=Sinclair|first2=CJ|last3=Bradley|first3=EL|last4=Boxall|first4=AB|title=Effects of environmental conditions on latex degradation in aquatic systems.|journal=The Science of the Total Environment|date=1 March 2013|volume=447|pages=225–34|pmid=23384646|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.12.067}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrady|first1=Anthony|title=Plastics and Environmental Sustainability|date=Feb 11, 2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=303|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue can have an effect on the wildlife on both land and in aquatic systems because animals will confuse deflated balloons as food, nesting material, or simply something to play with. When that happens, it can lead to negative effects for the animals. For example, a bird will use a deflated balloon as a component for its nest. When the eggs hatch, they will get tangled in the balloon and that can lead to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Rachael|title=Old balloons causing woes for wildlife, despite law - Latex, ribbons fall to earth after whimsical flights in sky|agency=New Haven Register|date=July 5, 2008|ref=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another environmental problem with latex balloons is not the effects the balloons have on the environment once they are decomposed, but when they are being made. When latex is being produced, it produces greenhouse gases, such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This is becoming an increasing problem, especially in Thailand which is responsible for 35% of the worlds natural rubber production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jawjit|first1=Warit|last2=Kroeze|first2=Carolien|last3=Rattanapan|first3=Suwat|title=Greenhouse gas emissions from rubber industry in Thailand|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=March 2010|volume=18|issue=5|pages=403–411|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air pressure===
{{Main|Atmospheric pressure}}
[[File:Jacques Charles Luftschiff.jpg|thumb|200px|Contemporary illustration of the first flight by Professor [[Jacques Charles]], December 1, 1783]]
Once inflated with regular, atmospheric air, the air inside the balloon will have a greater air pressure than the original atmospheric air pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Serway, Raymond, Chris Vuille, and Jerry Faughn (2008). ''College Physics'', Volume 10. Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Air pressure, technically, is a measurement of the amount of collisions against a surface at any time. In the case of balloon, it's supposed to measure how many particles at any in any given time space collide with the wall of the balloon and bounce off. However, since this is near impossible to measure, air pressure seems to be easier described as density. The similarity comes from the idea that when there are more molecules in the same space, more of them will be heading towards a collision course with the wall.

The first concept of air pressure within a balloon that is necessary to know is that air pressures "try" to even out. With all the bouncing against the balloon wall (both interior and exterior) there will be a certain amount of expansion/contraction. As air pressure itself is a description of the total forces against an object, each of these forces, on the outside of the balloon, causes the balloon to contract a tiny bit, while the inside forces cause the balloon to expand. With this knowledge, one would immediately assume that a balloon with high air pressure inside would expand based on the high amount of internal forces, and vice versa. This would make the inside and outside air pressures equal.

However, balloons have a certain elasticity to them that needs to be taken into account. The act of stretching a balloon fills it with [[potential energy]]. When it is released, the potential energy is converted to [[kinetic energy]] and the balloon snaps back into its original position, though perhaps a little stretched out. When a balloon is filled with air, the balloon is being stretched. While the elasticity of the balloon causes tension that would have the balloon collapse, it is also being pushed back out by the constant bouncing of the internal air molecules. The internal air has to exert force not only to counteract the external air to keep the air pressures "even", but it also has to counteract the natural contraction of the balloon. Therefore, it requires more air pressure (or force) than the air outside the balloon wall. Because of this, when helium balloons are left and they float higher, as atmospheric pressure decreases, the air inside it exerts more pressure than outside it so the balloon pops from tension. In some cases, the helium leaks out from pores and the balloon deflates, falling down.&lt;ref&gt;"Balloons." Reach Out Michigan. N.p., n.d. Web. November 30, 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">'''Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) flooding''' is a process whereby [[carbon dioxide]] is injected into an oil reservoir in order to increase output when extracting [[crude oil|oil]].
[[Image:Carbon dioxide pressure-temperature phase diagram.jpg|frame|'''Figure 1.''' Carbon dioxide pressure-temperature phase diagram]]
When a [[oil reserves|reservoir’s]] pressure is depleted through primary and secondary production, carbon dioxide flooding can be an ideal [[Extraction of petroleum#Tertiary recovery|tertiary recovery]] method. It is particularly effective in reservoirs deeper than 2,500&amp;nbsp;ft., where {{CO2}} will be in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] state, with [[API gravity|API oil gravity]] greater than 22–25° and remaining oil saturation greater than 20%. Carbon dioxide flooding is not affected by the [[lithology]] of the reservoir area, but simply by the reservoir porosity and permeability, so that it is viable in both sandstone and carbonate reservoirs.
By injecting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the reservoir, the [[viscosity]] of any [[hydrocarbon]] will be reduced and hence will be easier to sweep to the production well.

As an oil field matures and production rates decline, there is growing incentive to intervene and attempt to increase oil output utilizing tertiary recovery techniques (also termed improved or [[enhanced oil recovery]]). Petroleum engineers assess available options for increasing well productivity, options that include chemical injection, thermal/steam injection, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection. Based on data-gathering and computer simulations, the most optimal enhanced oil-recovery technique to maximize well-productivity is determined. To increase the rate of oil production, the pressure within the reservoir must be increased.

In CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flooding, the first step is injection of water into the reservoir, which will cause the reservoir pressure to increase. Once the reservoir has sufficient pressure, the next step is to pump the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; down through the same injection wells. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas is forced into the reservoir to come into contact with the oil. This creates a [[miscible]] zone that can be moved more easily to the production well. Normally the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection is alternated with water injection and the water acts to sweep the oil towards the production zone.

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flooding is the second most common tertiary recovery technique and is used in facilities around the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In connection with greenhouse gas emissions and [[global warming]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flooding [[Carbon sequestration|sequester]]s {{CO2}} underground and therefore offsets CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions elsewhere.

'''Carousell''' is a [[smartphone]] and web-based [[consumer to consumer]] marketplace for buying and selling new and secondhand goods. It is headquartered in [[Singapore]]. Carousell operates within [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=Carousell2015 /&gt; Carousell is currently available as a mobile app for both [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.&lt;ref name=apple2015 /&gt;

==History==

Carousell was founded in [[Singapore]] on May 14, 2012, by co-founders Quek Siu Rui, Lucas Ngoo, and Marcus Tan, all graduates of [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]]&lt;ref name=JackyYap2014 /&gt; The first item sold on Carousell was an [[Amazon Kindle]] e-reader for S$75.&lt;ref name=JackyYap2012 /&gt; Carousell was subsequently registered as Carousell Pte. Ltd. on Jan 2, 2013.&lt;ref name="sgpbusiness"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAROUSELL PTE. LTD. (201300296D) - Singapore Business Directory|accessdate=4 October 2017|publisher=SGPBusiness.com|url=https://www.sgpbusiness.com/company/Carousell-Pte-Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carousell received its first investment from [[Quest Ventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vulcanpost.com/601761/singapore-startup-investors/|title=S'pore Startup Founders Talk About Their First Investors, And The Meetings That Started It All|last=Chan|first=Melissa|date=2017-03-06|work=Vulcan Post|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, [[Rakuten]], with follow-on investments by Golden Gate Ventures, 500 Startups, and a few other investors invested $1 million in Carousell.&lt;ref name=TechinAsia2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TechinAsia2013 /&gt; Subsequently, in November 2014, Carousell announced that it received US$6 million in investment from Sequoia India.&lt;ref name=Todayonline2014 /&gt; In August 2016, Carousell raised $35 million in their Series B funding round by Rakuten Ventures, Sequoia India, Golden Gate Ventures, and [[500 Startups]].&lt;ref name=Vulcanpost2016 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techinasia.com/carousell-series-b-funding|title=Tech in Asia - Connecting Asia's startup ecosystem|website=www.techinasia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, over 23 million items had been sold on Carousell and users had created over 57 million listings of new and used items for sale.&lt;ref name=Techinasia2016 /&gt;

Carousell has expanded regionally to seven countries, including [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name=Vulcanpost2016 /&gt; However, Carousell's expansion into [[Taiwan]] faces competition against headstart companies like [[Yahoo!]] and Ruten, which are already settled in the e-commerce market.&lt;ref name=JoshHorwitz2014 /&gt;

The company raised $85 million Series C funding in May 2018. The round was co-led by existing investor Rakuten Ventures  and EDBI. Other participants included [[500 Startups]], Golden Gate Ventures and [[Sequoia Capital|Sequoia]] India as well as new investor [[DBS Bank|DBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/13/carousell-raises-85m/|title=Southeast Asia-based mobile listings startup Carousell raises $85M – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships and collaborations==

In January 2013, Singapore Press Holdings' ST Classifieds announced its collaboration with Carousell.&lt;ref name=STClassifieds /&gt;

According to a Yahoo Finance article in August 2013, Carousell announced its partnership with Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Magazines, a subsidiary of SPH, to create a mobile app called SheShops Marketplace, selling fashion and beauty items.&lt;ref name=asiaonenews2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=YahooFinance2013 /&gt;

==Operation==
Carousell is an online mobile platform for consumers to buy or sell items. It lists and sells a variety of products. Items are prohibited for sale on Carousell if they are illegal or they violate the marketplace's community guidelines.&lt;ref name=ProhibiteditemsonCarousell /&gt;

==Criticism==
In a Yahoo [[Tumblr]] page, images of users posting photos or screenshots of their bad experiences they encounter on Carousell relating to scam, fraud and harassment have circulated on social media platforms like [[Facebook]] and [[Tumblr]].&lt;ref name=YahooTumblr /&gt; Users of Carousell have also complained about cases of scams by fake sellers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2000">'''Cluster Impact Fusion''' is a suggested method of producing practical [[fusion power]] using small clusters of [[heavy water]] molecules directly accelerated into a [[titanium]]-[[deuterium|deuteride]] target. Calculations suggested that such a system enhanced the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] by many orders of magnitude.

The idea was first reported by researchers at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|Brookhaven]] in 1989. Intrigued by recent reports of [[cold fusion]], they attempted to study potential causes for the effect by accelerating tiny droplets of heavy water, about 25 to 1300 D2O molecules each, into a target at about 220 eV. To their surprise they immediately saw fusion effects, at a rate that was many times what any of them could explain via conventional theory.{{ref|1}}

The experiment was fairly simple in concept but required an appropriate accelerator, so it was some time before other labs were able to repeat the experiments. One of the first was the [[University of Washington]], who reported a null result in 1991. Further experiments and a review from [[MIT]]{{ref|2}} in 1992 solved the mystery: the fusion products were the results of contamination, which could be eliminated by filtering with a magnet. The Brookhaven experimenters tried this and the effect disappeared. Cluster fusion references end abruptly at that point{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1714">'''Cycle of quantification/qualification''' (C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;) is a parameter used in [[real-time polymerase chain reaction]] techniques, indicating the cycle number where a PCR amplification curve meets a predefined mathematical criterion. A C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; may be used for quantification of the target sequence or to determine whether the target sequence is present or not.

Two criteria to determine the  C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; are used by different thermocyclers:
Cycle of Threshold (CT) is the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross a given value threshold. Usually, the threshold is set above the baseline, about 10 times the [[standard deviation]] of the noise of the baseline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gene-quantification.com/real-time-pcr-handbook-life-technologies-update-flr.pdf |format=PDF |title=Life Technologies : Real-time PCR handbook |publisher=Gene-quantification.com |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid random effects on the CT. However, the threshold shouln't be set much higher than that to avoid reduced reproducibility due to uncontrolled factors. 
Crossing point (Cp)  and Take off point (TOP) are the cycle value of the maximum second derivative of the amplification curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/20/e122.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=Standardized determination of real-time PCR effciency from a single reaction set-up |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=2003 |volume=31 |publisher=Gene-quantification.com |accessdate=2015-09-27 |doi=10.1093/nar/gng122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''density cup''' is an instrument that is used to ensure [[quality control]] in a [[paint]] or [[lacquer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D1475.htm|title=ASTM D1475 - 13 Standard Test Method For Density of Liquid Coatings, Inks, and Related Products|website=www.astm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It does this by measuring the [[density]] of the paint or lacquer, and comparing this density with the density of a standard for that paint or lacquer.&lt;ref name="byk.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.byk.com/en/instruments/products/liquid-paint/density-cups.html|title=Density is the weight per unit volume at a specified temperature.|website=www.byk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the density reading is different from the standard, then there is an error in paint composition because if there were no error in paint composition, then the measurement would match up to the standard density for that paint or lacquer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D2805.htm|title=ASTM D2805 - 11 Standard Test Method for Hiding Power of Paints by Reflectometry|website=www.astm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing the density of a paint is essential because a consistent density assures overall consistency between products of the same color.

Density cups are precisely measured cylinders that are made of [[stainless steel]], and usually have a hole in the top through which excess liquid and air bubbles can escape.&lt;ref name="byk.com"/&gt;

A '''dry blender''' is a type of [[industrial mixer]] which is typically used to blend multiple dry components until they are homogenous. Often minor liquid additions are made to the dry blend to modify the product formulation. Blending times using dry ingredients are often short (15–30 minutes) but are somewhat dependent upon the varying percentages of each component, and the difference in the bulk densities of each.

==Types==
Ribbon, Paddle, Tumble and Vertical Blenders are available. Many products including [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceuticals]], [[food]]s, [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], [[fertilizer]]s, [[plastic]]s, [[pigments]], and [[cosmetics]] are manufactured in these designs.

==Sizes==
Dry blenders range in capacity from half-cubic-foot [[laboratory]] models to 500-cubic-foot production units. A wide variety of [[horsepower]]-and-speed combinations and optional features such as sanitary finishes, vacuum construction, special valves and cover openings are offered by most manufacturers.

==Terminology==
[[File:Apollo15LunarRover.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]]'s [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s were battery-driven]]

Electric cars are a variety of [[electric vehicle]] (EV). The term "electric vehicle" refers to any vehicle that uses electric motors for propulsion, while "electric car" generally refers to highway-capable [[automobiles]] powered by electricity. [[Low-speed vehicle|Low-speed]] electric vehicles, classified as [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s (NEVs) in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/lsv/lsv.html|title=US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards |accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as electric [[motorised quadricycle]]s in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/automotive/files/cit-sum-com-542_en.pdfCitizens' summary EU proposal for a Regulation on L-category vehicles (two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles)]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are plug-in electric-powered [[microcar]]s or [[city car]]s with limitations in terms of weight, power and maximum speed that are allowed to travel on public roads and city streets up to a certain posted speed limit, which varies by country.

While an electric car's power source is not explicitly an on-board battery, electric cars with motors powered by other energy sources are typically referred to by a different name. An electric car carrying [[solar panel]]s to power it is a [[solar car]], and an electric car powered by a gasoline generator is a form of [[hybrid car]]. Thus, an electric car that derives its power from an on-board battery pack is a form of [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV). Most often, the term "electric car" is used to refer to [[battery electric vehicles]], but may also refer to [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV).

In 1897, electric cars found their first commercial use in the US.

Bailey &amp; Co.|Bailey Electric]] and others. Unlike gasoline-powered vehicles, the electric ones were less noisy, and did not require gear changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobilesreview.com/auto-news/some-facts-about-electric-vehicles/42240/ |title=Some Facts About Electric Vehicles |date=2012-02-25 |access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

Advances in [[internal combustion engine]]s (ICE) in the first decade of the 20th century lessened the relative advantages of the electric car. Their much quicker refueling times, and cheaper production costs, made them more popular. However, a decisive moment was the introduction in 1912 of the electric [[Starter (engine)|starter motor]] which replaced other, often laborious, methods of starting the ICE, such as [[Crank (mechanism)#20th Century|hand-cranking]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the early 1990s, the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal being a move to [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s such as electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=Daniel |first2=Deborah |last2=Gordon |title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year=2009| pages=22–26 |publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boschert06&gt;{{cite book |first=Sherry |last=Boschert |title=Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America |year=2006 |pages=15–28 |publisher=New Society Publishers| isbn=978-0-86571-571-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, automakers developed electric models, including the [[Chrysler TEVan]], [[Ford Ranger EV]] pickup truck, [[GM EV1]], and [[Chevrolet S10 EV|S10 EV]] pickup, [[Honda EV Plus]] hatchback, Nissan [[Nissan Altra|Altra EV]] miniwagon, and [[Toyota RAV4 EV]]. Both US Electricar and [[Solectria Force|Solectria]] produced 3-phase AC Geo-bodied electric cars with the support of GM, Hughes, and Delco. These early cars were eventually withdrawn from the U.S. market.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]] electric automaker [[Tesla Motors]] began development in 2004 on what would become the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]], which was first delivered to customers in 2008.

==Environmental aspects==
{{Main|Environmental aspects of the electric car}}

Electric cars have several benefits over conventional internal combustion engine automobiles, including a significant reduction of local [[air pollution]], as they do not directly emit [[motor vehicle emissions|pollutants]] such as [[particulate]]s ([[soot]]), [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], [[ozone]], [[lead]], and various [[NOx|oxides of nitrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth2tech.com/2010/03/17/should-pollution-factor-into-electric-car-rollout-plans/ |title=Should Pollution Factor Into Electric Car Rollout Plans?|publisher=Earth2tech.com |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electroauto.com/info/pollmyth.shtml |title=Electro Automotive: FAQ on Electric Car Efficiency &amp; Pollution|publisher=Electroauto.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cleanairnet.org/baq2003/1496/articles-58076_resource_1.doc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914201752/http://www.cleanairnet.org/baq2003/1496/articles-58076_resource_1.doc|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-09-14|first=Anil K. |last=Raut |title=Role of electric vehicles in reducing air pollution: a case of Katmandu, Nepal |publisher=The Clean Air Initiative |date= |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the production process and the source of the electricity to charge the vehicle, emissions may be partly shifted from cities to the material transportation, production plants and [[electricity generation|generation plants]].&lt;ref name="TwoBillion" /&gt; The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the [[emission intensity|emissions]] of the electricity source, and the efficiency of the vehicle.

The same is true of ICE vehicles. The sourcing of fossil fuels (oil well to tank) causes further damage and use of resources during the extraction and refinement processes,including high amounts of electricity. 
 
In December 2014, Nissan announced that Leaf owners have accumulated together 1&amp;nbsp;billion kilometers (620 million miles) driven.

Electric motors can provide high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s, batteries can be designed to supply the currents needed to support these motors. Electric motors have flat torque curve down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, many electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch.

Many electric cars have motors that have high acceleration, relative to comparable cars, however, [[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle]]s may have a low acceleration due to their relatively weak motors. This is largely due to the relatively constant torque of an electric motor, which often increase the acceleration relative to a similar [[horsepower|motor power]] internal combustion engine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Electric vehicles can also use a direct motor-to-wheel configuration which increases the available [[power (physics)|power]]. Having motors connected directly to each wheel allows the wheels to be used both for propulsion and as braking systems, thereby increasing [[traction (engineering)|traction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Wes Siler: Comment Email Facebook Twitter |url=http://jalopnik.com/5515071/raceabout-finlands-first-electric-sports-car |title=Helsinki Metropolia University's RaceAbout |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Mike Spinelli: Comment |url=http://jalopnik.com/307457/nissan-pivo-2-360-degrees-no-reverse |title=Nissan Pivo 2 |publisher=Jalopnik.com |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/plug-in-hybrid-retrofit-kit-ice-vehicle/11631/ |title=Charles Perry's Plug-In Hybrid Retrofit Kit |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; When not fitted with an [[axle]], [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], or [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], electric vehicles have less drive-train inertia.

==Energy efficiency==
{{main|Electric car energy efficiency}}

[[Internal combustion engine]]s have [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic limits]] on efficiency, expressed as fraction of energy used to propel the vehicle compared to energy produced by burning fuel. [[Gasoline engine]]s effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and [[diesel engine]]s can reach on-board efficiency of 20%, while electric vehicles have on-board efficiency of over 90%, when counted against stored chemical energy, or around 80%, when counted against required energy to recharge.&lt;ref name=PEVs2&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|first=Saurin D. |last=Shah|year=2009 |publisher=The Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1 |edition=1st |chapter=2|pages=29, 37 and 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electric motor]]s are more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric cars can not idle. [[Regenerative braking]], which is most common in electric vehicles, can recover as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt;

Production and [[Electric vehicle conversion|conversion]] electric cars typically use 10 to 23&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.17 to 0.37&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref name=ev1datasheet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/avta/pdfs/fsev/eva_results/ev1_eva.pdf |format=PDF|year=1999|publisher=United States Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |title=Performance Statistics – 1999 General Motors EV1 w/NiMH}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |publisher=Idaho National Laboratory |date=2006-05-30 |title=Full Size Electric Vehicles |chapter=Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity |url=http://avt.inel.gov/fsev.html |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webharvest.gov/peth04/20041015210239/http://avt.inel.gov/fsev.html |archivedate=2004-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 20% of this power consumption is due to [[Energy conversion efficiency|inefficiencies]] in charging the batteries. Tesla Motors indicates that the vehicle efficiency (including charging inefficiencies) of their [[lithium-ion battery]] powered vehicle is 12.7&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.21&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi) and the well-to-wheels efficiency (if the electricity is generated from natural gas) is 24.4&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.39&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/efficiency |publisher=Tesla Motors |title=Energy Efficiency of Tesla Electric Vehicles |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabin heating and cooling===
While heating can be provided with an electric resistance heater, higher efficiency and integral cooling can be obtained with a reversible [[heat pump]]. [[Temperature coefficient#Positive temperature coefficient of resistance|PTC junction cooling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |country-code=US |series-number=5889260 |title=Electrical PTC heating device |publication-date=30 March 1999 |editor1-last=Golan|editor1-first=Gad |editor2-last=Galperin|editor2-first=Yuly }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also attractive for its simplicity&amp;nbsp;— this kind of system is used, for example, in the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]].

To avoid using part of the battery's energy for heating and thus reducing the range, some models allow the cabin to be heated while the car is plugged in. For example, the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV and the Tesla Model S can be pre-heated while the vehicle is plugged in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NativeEnergy |url=https://www.recyclebank.com/live-green/3-electric-car-myths-that-will-leave-you-out-in-the-cold |title=3 Electric Car Myths That Will Leave You Out in the Cold |publisher=Recyclebank |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed |last=Piotrowski |url=http://cgdailydrive.com/how-i-survived-the-cold-weather/ |title=How i Survived the Cold Weather |publisher=The Daily Drive – Consumer Guide Automotive |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslarati.com/effects-winter-tesla-battery-range/|title= Effects of Winter on Tesla Battery Range and Regen|work=teslarati.com|date=2014-11-24|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electric cars, for example the [[Citroën Berlingo Electrique]], use an auxiliary heating system (for example [[gasoline]]-fueled units manufactured by Webasto or Eberspächer) but sacrifice "green" and "Zero emissions" credentials. Cabin cooling can be augmented with [[solar power]], or by automatically allowing outside air to flow through the car when parked. Two models of the 2010 Toyota Prius include this feature as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/options.html |title=2010 Options and Packages |work=Toyota Prius |publisher=Toyota |accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
[[File:V10084P006.jpg|thumb|Side impact test of a [[Tesla Model X]]]]

The safety issues of BEVs are largely dealt with by the international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 6469. This document is divided in three parts dealing with specific issues:

* On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery
* Functional safety means and protection against failures
* Protection of persons against electrical hazards.

At low speeds, electric cars produced less [[roadway noise]] than vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines. Blind or [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] people consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence electric cars and [[hybrid vehicle|hybrids]] could pose an unexpected hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-10-03-2698183585_x.htm|title=Blind people: Hybrid cars pose hazard|publisher=[[USA Today]]|first=Ben|last=Nuckols |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist0509"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13606446|title=Electric cars and noise: The sound of silence|publisher=Economist|date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have shown that this is a valid concern, as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below {{convert|20|mph|-1|abbr=on}}, which affects all road users, not just the visually impaired. At higher speeds, the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;

The [[Government of Japan]], the [[U.S. Congress]], and the [[European Parliament]] passed legislation to regulate the minimum level of sound for hybrids and [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s when operating in electric mode, so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20110104/AUTO01/101040430/Obama-signs-law-to-require-%E2%80%98quiet%E2%80%99-cars-to-get-noisier|title=Obama signs law to require 'quiet' cars to get noisier|work=[[The Detroit News]]|author=David Shepardson|date=2011-01-04|accessdate=2011-01-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TMC0810&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/08/0824.html|title=TMC to Sell Approaching Vehicle Audible System for 'Prius'|publisher=[[Toyota Motor Company]] News Release|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-363_en.htm|title=Commission welcomes Parliament vote on decreasing vehicle noise |author=European Commission Press Release|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2014-04-02|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first electric car to use Nissan's [[Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians]] system, which includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse.&lt;ref name=NYT0610B&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/blind-advocates-disappointed-in-nissan-e-v-sounds-for-pedestrians/?ref=automobiles|title=Blind Advocates ‘Disappointed’ in Nissan E.V.

Several anti-noise and electric car advocates have opposed the introduction of artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as such an introduction is based on vehicle type and not actual noise level, a concern regarding ICE vehicles which themselves are becoming quieter.

==Controls==
{{As of|2018}}, most Electric cars have similar driving controls to that of a car with a conventional [[automatic transmission]]. Even though the motor may be permanently connected to the wheels through a fixed-ratio gear and no [[parking pawl]] may be present the modes "P" and "N" are often still provided on the selector. In this case the motor is disabled in "N" and an electrically actuated [[hand brake]] provides the "P" mode.

In some cars the motor will spin slowly to provide a small amount of creep in "D", similar to a traditional automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Ford-Focus-BeV/245743/ |title=Ford Focus BEV – Road test |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the foot is lifted from the accelerator of an [[internal combustion engine|ICE]], [[engine braking]] causes the car to slow. An EV would coast under these conditions, if it wasn't for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] which instead provides a more familiar response and recharges the battery to an extent. These features also reduce the use of the conventional brakes, significantly reducing wear and tear and maintenance costs as well as improving vehicle range.

==Batteries==
[[File:NASA Lithium Ion Polymer Battery.jpg|thumb|Prototypes of 50 watt-hour/kilogram [[lithium-ion polymer battery]]. Newer lithium-ion cells can provide up to 130&amp;nbsp;W·h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles]]
{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}
Lithium-based batteries are often chosen for their high power and energy density, although may wear out over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/how-to/a7432/why-your-gadgets-batteries-degrade-over-time-6705747/|title=Why Your Gadgets' Batteries Degrade|date=2012-04-25|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many [[Electric battery#Solid state batteries|emergring technologies]] trying to combat this issue.

There are also other battery types, such as [[Nickel metal hydride battery|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)]] batteries which have a poorer power to weight ratio than lithium ion, but are cheaper. Several other battery chemistries are in development such as [[zinc-air battery]] which could be much lighter.

The range of production electric vehicles in 2017 ranged from {{convert|100|km|mi}} ([[Renault Twizy]]) to {{convert|540|km|mi}} ([[Tesla Model S|Tesla Model S 100D]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/01/22/tesla-long-range-electric-car/|title=Tesla Quietly Introduces Longest-Range Electric Car on the Market|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of electric cars are fitted with a display of expected range. This may take into account many factors of how the vehicle is being used, and what the battery is powering. However, since factors can vary over the route, the estimate can vary from the actual achieved range. The display allows the driver to make informed choices about driving speed and whether to stop at a charging point en route. Some [[roadside assistance]] organizations offer charge trucks to recharge electric cars in case of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electrek.co/2016/09/06/aaa-ev-emergency-charging-truck/|title=AAA says that its emergency electric vehicle charging trucks served "thousands" of EVs without power|work=Electrek|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charging===
{{main|Charging station}}
Electric cars are typically charged overnight from a charging station installed in the owner's house, or from faster charging stations found in businesses and public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/01/25/electric-vehicle-car-charging/1059349001/|title=Thinking of buying an electric vehicle? Here's what you need to know about charging|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overnight charge of 8 hours will only give about a 40 mile charge with a standard 120 volt outlet whereas a 240 volt outlet would give around 180 miles in the same amount of time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/car-charging-time-type-cost#.XACNxGhKiUl|title=Electric Vehicle Charging: Types, Time, Cost and Savings|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2018|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within each major region of the world, electric car charging stations are essentially universal across car and charger brands, and simply plugging in a charger into an electric car will charge the car at the fastest rate that car and charger can support.  A notable exception are the [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]] line of cars and charging stations, which use their own proprietary chargers. However, this can be solved by using a converter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/19/diginow-super-charger-v2-tesla-ev/|title=Diginow Super Charger V2 opens up Tesla destination chargers to other EVs|work=Autoblog|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies have been experimenting with [[battery swapping]] to eliminate delay while charging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.machinedesign.com/automotive/could-battery-swapping-ease-range-anxiety-ev-owners|title=Could Battery Swapping Ease Range Anxiety for EV Owners?|date=2016-07-19|work=Machine Design|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tesla charging station with solar collector trimmed.jpeg|thumb|Panoramic view of [[Tesla supercharger]] rapid charging station in [[Tejon, California|Tejon Ranch, California]] ]]

====Hybrid vehicles====
{{Further|Hybrid vehicle}}[[File:2018 BMW i3 facelift (1).jpg|thumb|The [[BMW i3]] has an optional gasoline-powered [[Range-extended vehicle|range extender]] engine]]

Some electric vehicles have built in generators, these are considered a type of [[hybrid vehicle]].

===Lifespan===
{{Main|rechargeable battery#Lifespan and cycle stability}}

As with all lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicle batteries may degrade over long periods of time, especially if they are frequently overcharged, however, this may take at least several years before being noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2013-04-life-lithium-ion-batteries-electric.html|title=Understanding the life of lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Nissan stated in 2015 that thus far only 0.01 percent of batteries had to be replaced because of failures or problems, and then only because of externally inflicted damage. The vehicles that had already covered more than {{convert|200,000|km|0|abbr=on}}, have no problems with the battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2015-04/elektroauto-batterie-akku-tesla-s/seite-2 „zeit.de: Batterie-Upgrade?

;Autonomous park-and-charge

Volkswagen, in collaboration with six partners, is developing an EU research project that is focused on automating the parking and charging of electric vehicles. The objective of this project is to develop a smart car system that allows for autonomous driving in designated areas (e.g. valet parking, park and ride) and can offer advanced driver support in urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ori.ox.ac.uk/older-projects/vcharge/|title=VCharge|work=Oxford Robotics Institute|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla has shown interest in making an arm that automatically charges their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/06/teslas-prehensile-car-charger-plugs-itself-in-automatically/|title=Tesla's prehensile car charger plugs itself in automatically|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering===
{{Main|vehicle-to-grid}}

During [[peak load]] periods, when the cost of generation can be very high, electric vehicles could contribute energy to the grid.  These vehicles can then be recharged during [[off-peak]] hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess night time generation. Here the batteries in the vehicles serve as a distributed storage system to buffer power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Feed Mixer.jpg|thumb|250px|Horizontal Ribbon Mixer]]
'''Feed mixers''' are used in [[Fodder|feed mills]] for the mixing of [[Animal feed|feed]] ingredients and [[premixes]]. The mixer plays a vital role in the feed production process, with efficient mixing being the key to good feed production. If feed is not mixed properly, ingredients and nutrients will not be properly distributed when it comes time to [[Food extrusion|extrude]] and pelletize the feed, or if the feed is to be used as mash. This means that not only would the feed not have nutritional benefit, it would be bad for the animals that are eating it.

==Mixer types==
There are a number of different type of mixers used in the feed industry with the most widely used being:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.feedmachinery.com/glossary/equipment/mixer/&lt;/ref&gt;

* Vertical Mixer – Used in small farms, they consist of a vertical screw which takes material to the top where it falls back down again, and repeats that process to mix materials
* Horizontal Mixer – Consisting of paddles (paddle mixer &lt;ref&gt;https://www.powderprocess.net/Equipments%20html/Paddle_mixer.html&lt;/ref&gt;) or blades (ribbon blender) attached to a horizontal rotor, these mixers usually have a higher consistent homogeneity and short mixing times.

These machines come in a variety of configurations:
*Round bowl- The sides are shaped in rounding configuration
*Decagon bowl- The sides are shaped with angled flats creating a circular configuration
*Square bowl- The sides are similar to a square box with the top being open to load feed.
*Paddle reel- A large rotating reel with paddles to move feed forward and back.
*Auger system- Multiple [[Screw conveyor|augers]] processing feed and moving forward and backwards in the tub.
*Vertical screw- A vertical standing auger moving feed upward and down the sides to process feed.

[https://www.britannica.com/science/flame-front]

One approach of modern combustion theory describes a [[premixed flame]] as a thin interface separating reactants and products. The surface of the interface that faces reactants is often termed as the flame front. Similarly, the surface that faces the products can be termed as the flame back.

Analysis of flow field and thermo-chemical structure at the flame front can provide information about the burning efficiency of a premixed flame...

A '''flux switching alternator''' is a form of high-speed [[alternator]], an [[alternating current|AC]] electrical generator, intended for direct drive by a [[turbine]]. They are simple in design, making them rugged and capable of high rotation speeds. This makes them suitable for their only widespread use, in [[guided missile]]s.{{efn-lr|"[[Missile]]" here is taken in its broad sense and could refer to any guided [[projectile]], potentially including [[torpedo]]es as well as airborne missiles.}}

== Guided missiles ==

Guided missiles require a source of electrical power during flight. This is needed to power the [[missile guidance|guidance]] and [[fuze|fuzing]] systems, possibly also the high-power loads of an [[active radar seeker]] (i.e. a transmitter) and rarely the missile's [[Flight control surfaces|control surfaces]]. Control surface [[actuator]]s for a high-speed missile require a high force and so these are usually powered by some non-electric means, such as tapping propellant [[exhaust gas]] from the missile's motor.&lt;ref name="Forbat, Vigilant" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rare exceptions where electrically powered control surfaces are used are mostly medium-range subsonic naval missiles, e.g. [[Exocet]], [[Harpoon (missile)|Harpoon]] and [[Martel (missile)|Martel]].&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Requirements" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total load varies for different missiles between around 100W to several kW.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Requirements" /&gt;

The electrical supply for a missile must be reliable, particularly after long storage. Depending on the missile type, it may also be required to start delivering power almost immediately after start-up, or even before launch to allow gyroscopes to be accelerated to speed,&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Requirements" /&gt; and to provide power for varying lengths of time.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Requirements" /&gt; Small [[anti-tank guided missile|anti-tank]] or [[air-to-air missile]]s may only require power for a few seconds of flight. Others, such as [[tactical missile]]s or [[ICBM]]s, may require power for several minutes. Turbojet-powered [[cruise missile]]s have the longest flight times (being long-ranged, yet also slowest in flight) however these also have engines that are capable of driving a more conventional generator.

Two technologies are used in practice to power missiles: batteries and generators. The batteries used are usually esoteric types rarely found outside missiles, such as [[silver-zinc battery|silver-zinc]] or [[Molten salt battery|thermal batteries]]. The generators used are simple high-speed generators, driven directly by a turbine rotor that is powered by either the rocket motor's exhaust, or else a dedicated [[gas generator]].&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Alternator drives" &gt;{{harvp|Brassey's, Guided Weapons|1988|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternator principles ==

The generator is required to be rugged and capable of very high speeds, as it is driven at the turbine's speed, without reduction gearing. The rotor must thus be simple in design and there can also be no sliding contacts to [[slipring]]s or other [[brush (electric)|brushgear]].&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Alternator drives" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rauch, 1955" &gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the power requirement for the missile may be a largely DC supply, the AC alternator and its need for a [[rectifier]] is still favoured for its mechanical robustness.{{sfnp|Mann|1957|pp=82–83}}

Unusually, both the [[field coil]]s and the armature winding are carried on the fixed stator. The rotor is a simple toothed wheel, with no windings or electrical components.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Inductor Alternator" &gt;{{harvp|Brassey's, Guided Weapons|1988|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest case, the stator has four poles and the field coils and armature windings are arranged alternately around the stator between the poles. The field magnets are arranged with their poles opposing each other, i.e. one armature is between the two North poles, one between the two South. The rotor is a simple toothed disc of magnetic, but unmagnetized, iron. As it rotates between poles, it links the flux between a single pair of opposing poles. The [[magnetic circuit]] of the stator is thus a pair of triangles, each containing a field, an armature and a shared path through the rotor. Flux passes in each circuit from one field and through one armature. As the rotor turns, the other triangular path is formed, switching the flux from one pair of field and armature to the other and also reversing the direction of the flux in the armature coil. It is this reversal of flux that produces the alternating [[electromotive force|emf]].&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Inductor Alternator" /&gt;

The rotor must bridge the path between opposing pole pieces, but must never bridge all four simultaneously. It must thus have an [[even number]] of poles, but this must not be divisible by four.&lt;ref name="Rauch, 1955" /&gt; Practical rotors use six poles.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Inductor Alternator" /&gt; As the rotation of one tooth pitch is sufficient to generate one AC cycle, the output frequency is thus the product of the rotation speed (in revs. per second) and the number of rotor teeth.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Inductor Alternator" /&gt; Early AC systems used the standard frequency of 400&amp;nbsp;Hz, which limited alternators to two pole rotors and a maximum rotation speed of 24,000&amp;nbsp;rpm.{{sfnp|Mann|1957|p=84}} The use of higher frequencies, from multi-pole rotors, was already recognised as a future means to achieve greater power for the same weight.{{sfnp|Mann|1957|pp=155–165}} The [[Seaslug (missile)|Seaslug]] missile alternator used a speed of 24,000&amp;nbsp;rpm to produce 1.5&amp;nbsp;kVA of electricity at 2,400&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Inductor Alternator" /&gt;

The field may be supplied by either permanent magnets or by field coils. Regulation of the output voltage is achieved by controlling the current through a winding, either the field coil, or a control winding around a permanent magnet.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Inductor Alternator" /&gt;

== Alternator drive ==

=== Propulsion motor ===

The simplest solution taps off some hot exhaust gas from the propulsion motor and routes it instead through the generator turbine.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Alternator drives" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT, 1957" &gt;{{Cite journal
  |title=Missile Internal Power

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gas may also be used to power the control surface actuators, as was used for Vigilant.&lt;ref name="Forbat, Vigilant" /&gt; This is one of the simplest and lightest electrical power supplies available for a missile.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Alternator drives" /&gt;

Bleeding exhaust gas from the motor increases the amount of fuel required, but this effect is trivial, around 1%. The exhaust is hot, possibly as hot as 2,400&amp;nbsp;°C, and at pressures varying from 2,600&amp;nbsp;psi at the [[boost phase]] to 465&amp;nbsp;psi during [[sustain phase|sustain]].&lt;ref name="Forbat, Vigilant" /&gt; A more serious drawback is the amount of sooty particulates in the exhaust,{{sfnp|Mann|1957|p=35}} which requires a filter to keep them from the turbine.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Alternator drives" /&gt; As such filters may themselves clog, this method is best suited for short flight durations.

=== Gas generator ===

A [[gas generator]] is a chemical device that burns to provide a supply of gas under pressure. Although still hot, comparable to rocket motor exhaust, this gas can be cooler and cleaner of particulates than rocket efflux.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Alternator drives" /&gt; Both solid and liquid-fuelled gas generators may be used.&lt;ref name="Brasseys, Alternator drives" /&gt;

Advantages of a gas generator drive, rather than motor exhaust are:
* Cleaner, cooler exhaust, which is less likely to cause turbine problems.
* Ability to start the gas generator before launching, allowing time for [[gyroscope]]s to be spun up to speed, power for control surfaces etc.
* Ability to continue power generation after the motor has burned out, during a ballistic [[coast phase]].

=== Development history ===
The first alternators of this type began with the first missiles requiring considerable electric power, those using radar seekers (initially [[semi-active radar homing]]). Development of these began in the late 1940s, with air-to-air missiles such as [[AIM-7 Sparrow|Sparrow]].&lt;ref name="Rauch, 1955" /&gt; Sparrow was a relatively large missile with an airframe 8 inches in diameter. By the late 1950s, turbine-driven alternators were also being used in lightweight anti-tank missiles such as [[Vickers Vigilant|Vigilant]].&lt;ref name="Forbat, Vigilant" /&gt; Vigilant has a body diameter of 4{{frac|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inches, including a {{frac|3|4}}&amp;nbsp;inch central jetpipe. The alternator and turbine was fitted into a remaining annular space of only 1{{frac|7|8}}&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name="Forbat, Vigilant" /&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite journal

==== Permanent magnet magnetos ====
An alternative high-speed generator is the permanent magnet [[magneto (generator)|magneto]]. Achieving the output needed depends on the use of modern [[rare earth magnet]]s, such as [[samarium cobalt]] or [[neodymium magnet|neodymium]]. The output coil is formed as a stator, with axial magnetic flux from a rotating multi-pole ring magnet.{{sfnp|Brassey's, Guided Weapons|1988|page=58}}

[[File:Presse-ail ikéa koncis 09.jpg|thumb|Many garlic presses also have a device with a matching grid of blunt pins to clean out the holes.]]
A '''garlic press''' (also known as a garlic crusher in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom), is a [[kitchen utensil]] to crush [[garlic]] cloves efficiently by forcing them through a grid of small holes, usually with some type of [[piston]]. Many garlic presses also have a device with a matching grid of blunt pins to clean out the holes.

Garlic presses present a convenient alternative to mincing garlic with a knife, especially because a clove of garlic can be passed through a sturdy press without even removing its peel. The peel remains in the press while the garlic is extruded out. Some sources&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [http://www.epicurious.com/cooking/how_to/food_dictionary/entry?id=2683 Epicurious Food Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; also claim that pressing with the peel on makes cleaning the press easier. 

Garlic crushed by a press is generally believed to have a different flavor from minced garlic, more of garlic's strong flavor compounds are liberated. A few sources prefer the flavor of pressed garlic. [[Raw food diet|Raw-foods]] chef Renée Underkoffler says "a good garlic press makes dealing with garlic a clean pleasure. Pressed garlic has a lighter, more delicate flavor than minced garlic because it excludes the bitter center stem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Underkoffler, Renée|title=Living Cuisine: The Art and Spirit of Raw Foods|publisher=Avery|year=2004|isbn=1-58333-171-9}} p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine ''[[Cook's Illustrated]]'' says "a good garlic press can break down cloves more finely and evenly than an average cook using a knife, which means better distribution of garlic flavor throughout any given dish."&lt;ref name="cooks"&gt;Wu, Sandra. "Notes from Readers", ''Cook's Illustrated'', Sept. &amp; Oct. 2006 p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some chefs say garlic crushed in a press has an inferior flavor compared to other forms of garlic. For instance, chef [[Anthony Bourdain]] called garlic presses "abominations" and advised "''don't'' put it through a press. I don't know what that junk is that squeezes out of the end of those things, but it ain't garlic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Bourdain, Anthony | title=Kitchen Confidential | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2001 | isbn=0-06-093491-3}} p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The cookery writer [[Elizabeth David]] wrote an essay titled "Garlic Presses are Utterly Useless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=David, Elizabeth | title=Is There a Nutmeg in the House? | publisher=Viking | year=2000 | isbn=0-670-03033-3}} p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alton Brown]] (known for his dislike of single-purpose kitchen tools) has referred to garlic presses as "useless" and without a reason to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170916083851/http://gizmodo.com:80/5347140/alton-brown-kitchen-gadget-judgment-calls---yea-or-nay | title = Alton Brown: Kitchen Gadget Judgment Calls - Yea or Nay? | last = Rothman | first = Wilson | date = 27 August 2009 | website = Gizmodo.com | access-date = 11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cook's Illustrated'' lists some additional uses for a garlic press, such as mashing other small items  (including [[olive]]s, [[caper]]s, [[anchovies]], and canned [[chipotle]]s) or pressing out small quantities of onion or [[shallot]] juice.&lt;ref name="cooks"/&gt;

The '''Great Online Shopping Festival''' (GOSF) was an online shopping event created by Google India on 12 December 2012 in collaboration with a number of Indian online shopping portals. The concept of the GOSF was that the online shopping sites would give heavy discounts for one day, in order to promote their sales. In November 2015, Google announced that the event would not be repeated. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/google-logs-out-of-its-flagship-online-shopping-festival-gosf/articleshow/49643856.cms |title=Google logs out of its flagship Online Shopping Festival GOSF |date= 4 November 2015 |publisher=''[[The Economic Times]]'' | accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of a one-day online sale originated in the United States, where many online shopping sites offer discounts on "[[Cyber Monday]]", the first Monday after the so-called [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], the day that follows the U.S. [[Thanksgiving]]. Cyber Monday started in 2005 and the concept has spread to several countries including Canada, Japan, Australia, Colombia, and the U.K.. In China a similar day of online shopping is observed on November 11, which is known as "[[Singles Day]]".

The first Great Online Shopping Festival in 2012 was advertised on [[YouTube]] and via posts on [[Google Plus]]. For the event, Google partnered with a number of ecommerce sites such as [[Flipkart]], [[HomeShop18]], [[Snapdeal]], [[Indiatimes shopping]], [[Infibeam]] and [[Makemytrip]], which would participate in the GOSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google partners e-commerce sites for 'Cyber Monday' on December 12|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-12-04/news/35594711_1_operations-rajan-anandan-google-india-md-online-travel-sites|accessdate=9 December 2012|newspaper=Economic Times|date=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecommerce sites created dedicated landing pages for GOSF. GOSF site engaged users through games and showing offers and eventually it redirected users to the dedicated landing pages of ecommerce sites to do the transactions.

According to critics, the first GOSF left some consumers a little disappointed as the discounts were marginal or nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digit.in/internet/great-online-shopping-festival-success-or-sham-11733.html |title=Great Online Shopping Festival: success or sham? |date=12 December 2012 |publisher=''[[Digit (magazine)|Digit]]'' |accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Great Online Shopping Festival was held on 11–14 December. Participating companies included [[Myntra]], [[Jabong.com]], and Indiatimes Shopping. Google claimed that the shopping festival was a success for the companies, and extended the event, which was planned to end on 13 December, by one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=E-commerce sites ride high on Google online shopping fest |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-12-17/internet/45294009_1_the-gosf-google-india-great-online-shopping-festival|accessdate=10 Jan 2014|newspaper=Times of India|date=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the GOSF took place on 10-12 December, and involved over 450 online retailers.{{cn|date=January 2015}} 2014 GOSF included several categories such as lifestyle, electronics, books and media, home and kitchen, groceries, mobile apps, automobiles, and real estate. Discounts were also given on career services, health care and insurance policies, travel packages and matrimonial plans. Several brands also launched new products at the GOSF.&lt;ref name="GOSF"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gosf.in/|title=Google Online Shopping Festival |date=2 Dec 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202110158/https://www.gosf.in/new |archivedate=2 December 2014 |publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hoe-farming'''  is a term introuduced (as {{lang-de|Hackbau}}) by [[Eduard Hahn]] in 1910
to collectively refer to primitive forms of [[agriculture]], defined by the absence of the [[plough]]. [[Tillage]] in hoe-farming cultures is done by simple manual tools such as 
[[digging stick]]s or [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]].
Hoe-farming is the earliest form of agriculture practiced in the [[Neolithic Revolution]].
Early forms of the plough (''[[Ard (plough)|ard]]'') were introduced throughout the Near East  ([[Naqada II]]) and Europe  ([[Linear Pottery culture]]) by the 5th to 4th millennium BC. 
The invention spread throughout [[Greater Persia]] and parts of [[Central Asia]], reaching [[East Asia]] in the 2nd millennium BC ([[Chinese Bronze Age]]).&lt;ref&gt;

c.f. Robert Greenberger, The Technology of Ancient China (New York: Rosen Publishing Group, Inc., 2006), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The parts of the world where  [[center of origin|agriculture was introduced]] but not the plough  (in the case of the [[New World]] up to the introduction of plough-farming with [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonisation]]) were named the '''hoe-cultivation belt''' ({{lang|de|Hackbaugürtel}}) by Hahn (1914), followed by Werth (1954). 
The Hoe-cultivation belt is mostly located in [[tropics|tropical latitudes]], including  [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (but not the Horn of Africa, where the plough appears to have been introduced 
via Egypt), the [[Indian subcontinent]],&lt;ref&gt;India is included in the hoe-cultivation belt by Werth (1954), and ploughing was unknown in India at the time of British colonisation in the 19th century (Julius Jeffreys, ''The British Army in India'', 1858, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fGcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA258 p. 258]),  but indirect evidence for the use of the plough in South India around  800 BC has been described since, see:

Krishna, ''Agroecosystems of South India: Nutrient Dynamics, Ecology and Productivity'', 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=axuIMv_Nh8EC&amp;pg=PA27 p. 27].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], and the [[Pre-Columbian agriculture|pre-Columbian Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fernand Braudel]], S.

Hoe-farming often coincides with long fallow systems and [[shifting cultivation]], The split hoe, (also known as prong hoes, tined hoes or bent forks) are hoes that have two or more tines at right angles to the shaft. Their use is typically to loosen the soil, prior to planting or sowing. It points out that the ability to cultivate effectively at small row distances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12194">{{short description|Reservoir to store and stabilise fluid pressure}}
A '''hydraulic accumulator''' is a [[pressure]] storage reservoir in which a [[incompressible|non-compressible]] [[hydraulic fluid]] is held under pressure that is applied by an external source. The external source can be a [[spring (device)|spring]], a raised [[weight]], or a compressed [[gas]].&lt;ref group="note" &gt;Although liquids are generally considered to be practically incompressible, gases may be compressed and this compressed gas is a convenient energy store.&lt;/ref&gt; An accumulator enables a hydraulic system to cope with extremes of demand using a less powerful pump, to respond more quickly to a temporary demand, and to smooth out pulsations.  It is a type of [[energy storage]] device.

Compressed gas accumulators, also called hydro-pneumatic accumulators, are by far the most common type.

== Types of accumulators ==
=== Towers ===
[[File:Grimsby Dock Tower (aerial view).jpg|thumb|[[Grimsby Dock Tower]]]]
The first accumulators for [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Armstrong]]'s hydraulic dock machinery were simple raised [[water tower]]s. Water was pumped to a tank at the top of these towers by steam pumps. When dock machinery required hydraulic power, the [[hydrostatic head]] of the water's height above ground provided the necessary pressure.

These simple towers were extremely tall. One of the best known, [[Grimsby Dock Tower]] opened in 1852, is {{convert|300|ft}} tall. The size of these towers made them expensive to construct. These simple tower accumulators were constructed for less than a decade. Around the same time, [[Sir John Fowler, 1st Baronet|John Fowler]] was working on the construction of the ferry quay at nearby [[New Holland, Lincolnshire|New Holland]] but could not use similar hydraulic power as the poor ground conditions did not permit a tall accumulator tower to be built. By the time Grimsby was opened, it was already obsolete as Armstrong had developed the more complex, but much smaller, weighted accumulator for use at New Holland.&lt;ref name="Pugh, 1980, 3–4" /&gt; In 1892 the original Grimsby tower's function was replaced, on Fowler's advice, by a smaller weighted accumulator on an adjacent dock, although the tower remains to this day as a well-known landmark.

Another surviving tower is adjacent to [[Great Float#Central Hydraulic Tower and Engine House|East Float]] in [[Birkenhead]], England.

===Raised weight===
[[File:Underfallyardexternalaccumulator.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Hydraulic engine house, Bristol Harbour]]]]
A raised weight accumulator consists of a vertical cylinder containing fluid connected to the hydraulic line. The cylinder is closed by a piston on which a series of weights are placed that exert a downward force on the piston and thereby pressurizes the fluid in the cylinder. In contrast to compressed gas and spring accumulators, this type delivers a nearly  constant pressure, regardless of the volume of fluid in the cylinder, until it is empty. (The pressure will decline somewhat as the cylinder is emptied due to the decline in weight of the remaining fluid.)

A working example of this type of accumulator may be found at the [[hydraulic engine house, Bristol Harbour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original 1887 accumulator is in place in its tower, an external accumulator was added in 1954 and this system was used until 2010 to power the [[Cumberland Basin (Bristol)]] lock gates. The water is pumped from the harbour into a header tank and then fed by gravity to the pumps. The working pressure is 750 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] (5.2 [[megapascal|MPa]], or 52 [[bar (unit)|bar]]) which was used to power the cranes, bridges and locks of [[Bristol Harbour]].

The original operating mechanism of [[Tower Bridge]], [[London]], also used this type of accumulator.  Although no longer in use, two of the six accumulators may still be seen ''in situ'' in the bridge's museum.

[[Regent's Canal Dock]], now named [[Limehouse Basin]] has the remains of a hydraulic accumulator, dating from 1869, a fragment of the oldest remaining such facility in the world, the second at the dock, which was installed later than that at [[Poplar Dock]], originally listed incorrectly as a signalling cabin for the [[London and Blackwall Railway]], when correctly identified, it was restored as a tourist attraction by the now defunct [[London Docklands Development Corporation]].{{huh|date=January 2016}}&lt;!-- the preceding sentence is run-on beyond comprehension --&gt; Now owned by the [[British Waterways Board]], it is open for large groups on application to the Dockmaster's  Office at the basin and on both the afternoons of [[London Open House Weekend]], held on the third weekend of September each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marchant|first1=Hugo|title=Limehouse Basin|url=http://www.imvisitinglondon.com/limehousebasin.html|website=London Visitor's Guide|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London had an extensive public hydraulic power system from the mid-nineteenth century finally closing in the 1970s with 5 hydraulic power stations,  operated by the [[London Hydraulic Power Company]].  Railway [[goods yard]]s and docks often had their own separate system.

=== Air-filled accumulator ===
[[File:Hradec Králové Hasiči Historical 10.JPG|thumb|Steam fire engine, with vertical copper accumulator]]
A simple form of accumulator is an enclosed volume, filled with air. A vertical section of pipe, often enlarged diameter, may be enough and fills itself with air, trapped as the pipework fills.

Such accumulators do not have enough capacity to store power for long periods, but they can act as a buffer to absorb fluctuations in pressure. They are used to smooth out the delivery from piston pumps. Another use is as a shock absorber to damp out [[water hammer]].

{{-}}
===Compressed gas (or gas-charged) closed accumulator===
[[File:Kocsis Tech 80gal 6.5ksi piston accumulator.JPG|thumb|Piston accumulator]]
[[File:1990CitroenXM-engine.jpg|thumb|[[Citroën XM]] engine bay, showing two of Citroën's distinctive green spherical accumulators, used for the [[hydropneumatic suspension system]]]]

A compressed gas accumulator consists of a cylinder with two chambers that are separated by an elastic diaphragm, a totally enclosed bladder, or a floating piston. One chamber contains hydraulic fluid and is connected to the hydraulic line. The other chamber contains an inert gas under pressure (typically [[nitrogen]]) that provides the compressive force on the hydraulic fluid. Inert gas is used because oxygen and oil can form an [[explosive]] mixture when combined under high pressure. As the volume of the compressed gas changes, the pressure of the gas (and the pressure on the fluid) changes inversely.

It is possible to increase the gas volume of the accumulator by coupling a gas bottle to the gas side of the accumulator. This is mainly done since a gas bottle normally is cheaper to produce than an accumulator.

A compressed gas accumulator was invented by [[Jean Mercier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mercier|first1=Jean|title=Pressure device|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2786488|publisher=US Patent &amp; Trademark Office|date=26 March 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use in [[variable-pitch propeller]]s.

===Spring type===
A spring type accumulator is similar in operation to the gas-charged accumulator above, except that a heavy spring (or springs) is used to provide the compressive force. According to [[Hooke's law]] the magnitude of the force exerted by a spring is linearly proportional to its change of length. Therefore, as the spring compresses, the force it exerts on the fluid is increased linearly.

===Metal bellows type===
The metal bellows accumulators function similarly to the compressed gas type, except the elastic diaphragm or floating piston is replaced by a hermetically sealed welded [[metal bellows]]. Fluid may be internal or external to the bellows. The advantages to the metal bellows type include exceptionally low spring rate, allowing the gas charge to do all the work with little change in pressure from full to empty, and a long stroke relative to solid (empty) height, which gives maximum storage volume for a given container size. The welded metal bellows accumulator provides an exceptionally high level of accumulator performance, and can be produced with a broad spectrum of alloys resulting in a broad range of fluid compatibility. Another advantage to this type is that it does not face issues with high pressure operation, thus allowing more energy storage capacity.

== Functioning of an accumulator ==
In modern, often mobile, hydraulic systems the preferred item is a gas charged accumulator, but simple systems may be spring-loaded. There may be more than one accumulator in a system. The exact type and placement of each may be a compromise due to its effects and the costs of manufacture. 

An accumulator is placed close to the pump with a non-return valve preventing flow back to the pump. In the case of piston-type pumps this accumulator is placed in the ideal location to absorb pulsations of energy from the multi-piston [[axial piston pump|pump]]. It also helps protect the system from [[water hammer|fluid hammer]]. This protects system components, particularly pipework, from both potentially destructive forces. 

An additional benefit is the additional energy that can be stored while the pump is subject to low demand. The designer can use a smaller-capacity pump. The large excursions of system components, such as landing gear on a large aircraft,  that require a considerable volume of fluid can also benefit from one or more accumulators. These are often placed close to the demand to help overcome restrictions and drag from long pipework runs. The outflow of energy from a discharging accumulator is much greater, for a short time, than even large pumps could generate. 

An accumulator can maintain the pressure in a system for periods when there are slight leaks without the pump being cycled on and off constantly. When temperature changes cause pressure excursions the accumulator helps absorb them. Its size helps absorb fluid that might otherwise be locked in a small fixed system with no room for expansion due to valve arrangement. 

The gas precharge in an accumulator is set so that the separating bladder, diaphragm or piston does not reach or strike either end of the operating cylinder. The design precharge normally ensures that the moving parts do not foul the ends or block fluid passages. Poor maintenance of precharge can destroy an operating accumulator. A properly designed and maintained accumulator should operate trouble-free for years.

'''Instruction creep''' occurs when instructions increase in number and size over time until they are unmanageable. It can be insidious and damaging to the success of large groups such as corporations, originating from ignorance of the [[KISS principle]] and resulting in over-complex (as opposed to "simplified") procedures that are often misunderstood, followed with great irritation, or ignored.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Instruction creep is common in complex organizations, where rules and guidelines are created by changing groups of people over extended periods of time.  The constant state of flux in such groups often leads them to add or modify instructions, rather than simplifying or consolidating existing ones.  This can result in considerable overlap in the message of directives, at the expense of clarity, efficiency, and communication, or even of consistency.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The fundamental fallacy of instruction creep is believing that people read instructions with the same level of attention and comprehension, regardless of the volume or complexity of those instructions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}  A byproduct is the advent of many new rules having the deliberate intent to control others via [[wikt:fiat#Noun|fiat]], without considering consensus or collaboration. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This tends to antagonize others, even when it appears to the instigators that they are acting with proper intent.

'''Integrated circuit layout''', also known '''IC layout''', '''IC mask layout''', or '''mask design''', is the representation of an [[integrated circuit]] in terms of planar [[geometric shape]]s which correspond to the patterns of [[metal]], [[silicon oxide|oxide]], or [[semiconductor]] layers that make up the components of the integrated circuit. 

When using a standard process—where the interaction of the many chemical, thermal, and photographic variables is known and carefully controlled—the behaviour of the final integrated circuit depends largely on the positions and interconnections of the geometric shapes. Using a computer-aided layout tool, the layout engineer—or layout technician—places and connects all of the components that make up the chip such that they meet certain criteria—typically: performance, size, density, and manufacturability. This practice is often subdivided between two primary layout disciplines: Analog and digital.

The generated layout must pass a series of checks in a process known as physical verification. The most common checks in this verification process are&lt;ref&gt;A. Kahng, J. Lienig, I. Markov, J. Hu: ''VLSI Physical Design: From Graph Partitioning to Timing Closure'', {{ISBN|978-90-481-9590-9}}, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Design rule checking|design rule checking (DRC)]], 
* [[Layout versus schematic|layout versus schematic (LVS)]], 
* [[parasitic extraction]], 
* [[Physical verification#Antenna check|antenna rule checking]], and 
* [[Physical verification#Electrical rule check (ERC)|electrical rule checking (ERC)]].  

When all verification is complete, the data is translated into an industry-standard format, typically [[GDSII]], and sent to a semiconductor foundry. The process of sending this data to the foundry is called [[tapeout]] because the data used to be shipped out on a magnetic tape. The foundry converts the data into another format and uses it to generate the [[photomask]]s used in a [[photolithography|photolithographic]] process of [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor device fabrication]].

In the earlier, simpler, days of IC design, layout was done by hand using opaque tapes and films, much like the early days of [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) design. Modern IC layout is done with the aid of [[IC layout editor]] software, mostly automatically using [[electronic design automation|EDA tool]]s, including [[place and route]] tools or [[schematic-driven layout]] tools. The manual operation of choosing and positioning the geometric shapes is informally known as "[[polygon]] pushing".{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''Iterative design''' is a [[design]] methodology based on a cyclic process of [[prototyping]], [[Product testing|testing]], analyzing, and refining a product or process.  Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made.  This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design.  In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented.

==Iterative design process==
The iterative design process may be applied throughout the [[new product development]] process.  However, changes are easiest and less expensive to implement in the earliest stages of development.  The first step in the iterative design process is to develop a [[prototype]].  The prototype should be evaluated by a [[focus group]] or a group not associated with the product in order to deliver non-biased opinions.  Information from the focus group should be synthesized and incorporated into the next iteration of the design.  The process should be repeated until user issues have been reduced to an acceptable level.

===Application: Human computer interfaces===
Iterative design is commonly used in the development of human computer interfaces.  This allows designers to identify any usability issues that may arise in the user interface before it is put into wide use.  Even the best usability experts cannot design perfect user interfaces in a single attempt, so a usability engineering lifecycle should be built around the concept of iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Iterative User Interface Design | year = 1993 | author = Nielsen, J. | journal = IEEE Computer  vol.26 no.11 pp 32-41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical steps of iterative design in user interfaces are as follows:

# Complete an initial interface design
# Present the design to several test users
# Note any problems had by the test user
# Refine interface to account for/fix the problems
# Repeat steps 2-4 until user interface problems are resolved

Iterative design in user interfaces can be implemented in many ways.  One common method of using iterative design in computer software is [[software testing]].  While this includes testing the product for functionality outside of the user interface, important feedback on the interface can be gained from subject testing early versions of a program.  This allows software companies to release a better quality product to the public, and prevents the need of product modification following its release.

Iterative design in online (website) interfaces is a more continual process, as website modification, after it has been released to the user, is far more viable than in software design.  Often websites use their users as test subjects for interface design, making modifications based on recommendations from visitors to their sites.

==Iterative design use==
Iterative design is a way of confronting the reality of unpredictable user needs and behaviors that can lead to sweeping and fundamental changes in a design. User testing will often show that even carefully evaluated ideas will be inadequate when confronted with a user test. Thus, it is important that the flexibility of the iterative design’s implementation approach extends as far into the system as possible. Designers must further recognize that user testing results may suggest radical change that requires the designers to be prepared to completely abandon old ideas in favor of new ideas that are more equipped to suit user needs. Iterative design applies in many fields, from making knives to rockets. As an example consider the design of an [[electronic circuit]] that must perform a certain task, and must ultimately fit in a small space on a [[circuit board]]. It is useful to split these independent tasks into two smaller and simpler tasks, the functionality task, and the space and weight task. A [[breadboard]] is a useful way of implementing the electronic circuit on an interim basis, without having to worry about space and weight.

Once the circuit works, improvements or incremental changes may be applied to the breadboard to increase or improve functionality over the original design.  When the design is finalized, one can set about designing a proper circuit board meeting the space and weight criteria.  Compacting the circuit on the circuit board requires that the wires and components be juggled around without changing their electrical characteristics.  This juggling follows simpler rules than the design of the circuit itself, and is often [[Place and route|automated]]. As far as possible [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off the shelf]] components are used, but where necessary for space or performance reasons, custom made components may be developed.

Several instances of iterative design are as follows:

*'''Wiki''': A [[wiki]] is a natural repository for iterative design.  The 'Page History' facility allows tracking back to prior versions.  Modifications are mostly incremental, and leave substantial parts of the text unchanged.
*'''Common law''': The principle of [[legal precedent]] builds on past experience.  This makes law a form of iterative design where there should be a clear [[audit trail]] of the development of legal thought.
*'''Evolution''': There is a parallel between iterative and the theory of [[natural Selection]].  Both involve a trial and error process in which the most suitable design advances to the next generation, while less suitable designs perish by the wayside.  Subsequent versions of a product should also get progressively better as its producers learn what works and what doesn't in a process of refinement and [[Continual improvement process|continual improvement]].

==Fast prototyping tools==
One approach to iterative design is to use the highest level of abstraction for developing an early generation product. The principle here is that rapid development may not produce efficient code, but obtaining feedback is more important that technology optimization. Examples of this approach include use of non-functional code, object databases, or low code platforms - these allow quick testing of designs before issues of optimization are addressed.

==Benefits==
When properly applied, iterative design will ensure a product or process is the best solution possible.  When applied early in the development stage, significant cost savings are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Cost/Benefit Analysis for incorporating human factors in the software lifecycle | date = April 1988 | author = Marilyn Mantei; Toby Teorey  | journal = Publications of the ACM  vol.31 no.4 pp 428-439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other benefits to iterative design include:
# Serious misunderstandings are made evident early in the lifecycle, when it's possible to react to them.
# It enables and encourages user feedback, so as to elicit the system's real requirements.
# Where the work is contracted, Iterative Design provides an incremental method for more effectively involving the client in the complexities that often surround the design process.
# The development team is forced to focus on those issues that are most critical to the project, and team members are shielded from those issues that distract and divert them from the project's real risks.
# Continual testing enables an objective assessment of the project's status.
# Inconsistencies among requirements, designs, and implementations are detected early.
# The workload of the team, especially the testing team, is spread out more evenly throughout the lifecycle.
# This approach enables the team to leverage lessons learned, and therefore to continually improve the process.
# Stakeholders in the project can be given concrete evidence of the project's status throughout the lifecycle.

==Marshmallow Challenge==
[[File:Marshmallow_Challenge.jpg|thumb|Marshmallow challenge winning work.]]
The Marshmallow Challenge is an instructive design challenge. It involves the task of constructing the highest possible free-standing structure with a marshmallow on top. The structure must be completed within 18 minutes using only 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, and one yard of string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshmallowchallenge.com/Welcome.html |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=The Marshmallow Challenge |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bpwrap1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpwrap.com/2010/04/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |location=CA |publisher=BPWrap |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observation and studies of participants show that kindergartners are regularly able to build higher structures, in comparison to groups of business school graduates. This is explained by the tendency for children to at once stick the marshmallow on top of a simple structure, test the prototype, and continue to improve upon it. Whereas, business school students tend to spend time vying for power, planning, and finally producing a structure to which the marshmallow is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jerz |first=Dennis G. |url=http://jerz.setonhill.edu/weblog/2010/05/the_marshmallow_challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge - Jerz's Literacy Weblog |publisher=Jerz.setonhill.edu |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge was invented by Peter Skillman of [[Palm, Inc.]] and popularized by Tom Wujec of [[Autodesk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cameron |first=Chris |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/04/marshmallows-and-spaghetti-how-kindergartners-think-like-lean-startups.php |title=Marshmallows and Spaghetti: How Kindergartners Think Like Lean Startups |publisher=Readwriteweb.com |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineeringrevision.com/302/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=Engineeringrevision.com |date=2010-05-02 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selfishprogramming.com/2010/04/28/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=Selfish Programming |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideasforideas.com/content/marshmallow-challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713002340/http://www.ideasforideas.com/content/marshmallow-challenge|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/science/node/1578 |title=Marshmallow challenge &amp;#124; Faculty of Science &amp;#124; University of Calgary |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Original Design Challenge|title=Peter Skillman Marshmallow Design Challenge|date=2014-01-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p5sBzMtB3Q|accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''kadenze.com''', operated by  Kadenze, Inc. ("Kadenze"), is a for-profit [[massive open online course]] (MOOC) provider that offers courses geared toward art, music, and creative technology, fields which are falling behind other fields such as computer science in terms of number of courses offered in the MOOC space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Can MOOC Providers Create an Interactive Learning Experience in the Arts?|url = http://amt-lab.org/blog/2016/1/how-can-mooc-providers-create-an-interactive-learning-experience-in-the-arts|website = AMT Lab @ CMU|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fine Arts Programs Slowly Move Online|url = https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/articles/2015/07/20/fine-arts-programs-slowly-move-online|website = US News &amp; World Report|date = 2015-07-20|access-date = 2016-02-20|first = Jordan|last = Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched on June 16, 2015 with 18 academic partners including:  [[Stanford University]], [[Princeton University]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[California Institute of the Arts]], [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago|School of Art Institute of Chicago]], [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College]], [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design|MassArt]], [[Seoul Institute of the Arts]], [[Paris College of Art]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[Cornish College of Art]], [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[Rhode Island School of Design]], [[Pacific Northwest College of Art]], [[Arizona State University]], [[Columbus College of Art and Design]], and [[School of Visual Arts]].

== Platform and technology ==
The primary method of learning on kadenze.com is through video-based lectures. Courses typically range from five to eight sessions long, with each session broken up into a group of short lessons.

A course can run in either Scheduled or Adaptive mode. A Scheduled course follows a set calendar, with a course start/end date, prescribed due dates for assignments, and new lecture content that is released on specific dates (e.g. once a week). Adaptive courses are more flexible in terms of scheduling, allowing learners to initiate sessions and progress through course material at their own pace. While all video are immediately accessible when running in Adaptive mode, assignments are “unlocked” upon completing the previous assignment. A suggested due date of 1-week is set to help learners stay on track, however, learners can go at their own pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scheduled vs. Adaptive Courses|url = http://www.kadenze.help/customer/en/portal/articles/2276774-scheduled-vs-adaptive-courses?b_id=4808|website = Kadenze|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Core to the used [[Kannu (learning management system)|Kannu]] platform is the ability to embed media (image, video, audio) nearly anywhere on the platform, such as a course’s forums and gallery. This enables learners and customers/purchasers of the Premium membership to engage with one another’s works without the need to leave the learning environment. This also expands the possibilities of peer assessment based learning methods (which is a common form of assessment on MOOC platforms).

== Membership ==
kadenze.com offers a tier-based membership model. The free tier enables learners to watch all lecture material, and to participate in the course forums. A fee-based Premium membership allows students to have full participation in courses, submit assignments, receive grades and feedback, collaborate with peers, build their online portfolio, and gain eligibility to receive a verified Certificate of Accomplishment if a course is completed satisfactorily. Additionally, many courses offer Premium Members access to exclusive student discounts from the kadenze.com industrial partners. Some courses on kadenze.com are also offered as credit-eligible, meaning that learners can take the course for actual college credit from the partnering institution. Many of the individual courses in area of sub specialization are available as part of a Program. 

== History ==
After being awarded a National Science Foundation grant in 2012 to study methods of teaching computer science to non-programmers, specifically art students, Kapur and Cook taught a music programming language course on another MOOC platform. The course saw around 45,000 students enroll. However, it was clear that there were limited options for these art-tech courses online, and challenges emerged in trying to effectively measure students’ work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kadenze Brings High-Quality Creative Arts Education Platform Online|url = http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/kadenze-brings-high-quality-creative-arts-education-platform-online/ar-BBldivA|website = www.msn.com|access-date = 2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kadenze was founded as a Delaware corporation in September 2013 by the 6 cofounders with Ashok Ahuja as the lead investor and Executive Chairman and Jordan Hochenbaum as the individual providing strategic and product direction. kadenze.com was launched in June 2015, with 18 international educational partners offering courses ranging from art history to computer programming for musicians and artists. At launch, kadenze.com also offered credit-eligible courses from some of its partners including [[California Institute of the Arts]] and [[Otis College of Art and Design]].

As of February 2017 kadenze.com has expanded its partner list to 31 educational partners including two non-profit organizations. Today, kadenze.com offers approximately 100 courses in a number of creativity related fields including business, music, music technology, visual arts, creative computing, computational graphics, design, history and culture, fashion, entertainment technology, math, game design, film, curation, and web development. Many of these courses are similar to courses already taught at partner non-profit public and private institutions, and feature the staff and faculty from these partner institutions. The kadenze.com website does not disclose the terms of agreement or the level of financial remuneration it offers the staff and faculty already holding positions at non-profit partner institutions. Additionally, Kadenze has established partnerships with industrial for-profit partners including [[Ableton]], [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], [[Cognella]], [[Focusrite]], [[Manning Publications]], [[Native Instruments]], [[Novation]], and RME. These courses are offered under the Kadenze Academy banner.  Some of the industrial partners offer kadenze.com premium members additional benefits. Similarly, the kadenze.com website does not disclose the terms of agreement it has with industrial partners and whether the industrial partners also have pre-existing agreements with partner institution, which is likely due to commercial sensitivities.

On November 19, 2015, Kadenze launched [[Kannu (learning management system)|Kannu]], a learning management system geared toward creative education, music, arts, and design. Early adopters of the customized platform on campus were [[California Institute of the Arts]], [[Otis College of Art and Design]] [[Rhode Island School of Design]], [[Goldsmiths College]], [[Stanford University]] and non academic institutions such as Unity and  Maker Media Inc.

In November 2016, [[EdSurge]] did a review of the progress on Kadenze, one year after launching &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siu|first1=Antoinette|title=Kadenze’s March Toward Online Art Education, 1 Year Later|url=https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-10-20-kadenze-s-march-toward-online-art-education-1-year-later|accessdate=October 20, 2016|publisher=EdSurge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lateral thinking''' is a manner of solving problems using an indirect and [[creativity|creative]] approach via [[reasoning]] that is not immediately obvious. It involves ideas that may not be obtainable using only traditional step-by-step [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford English Dictionary: Lateral thinking|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/lateral_thinking|accessdate=19 December 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was promulgated in 1967 by [[Edward de Bono]]. He cites as an example the [[Judgment of Solomon]], where King Solomon resolves a dispute over the parentage of a child by calling for the child to be cut in half, and making his judgment according to the reactions that this order receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cdYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22example+of+lateral+thinking%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlxsjOsOzQAhXMJ8AKHRKgBCgQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22example%20of%20lateral%20thinking%22&amp;f=false|title=Snoopy or the Tiger?|date=18 November 1968|work=New York Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=61|language=en|last1=Diebold|first1=John|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edward de Bono also links lateral thinking with humour, arguing there's a switch-over from a familiar pattern to a new, unexpected one.  It is in this moment of surprise generating laughter and new insight which facilitates the ability of seeing a different thought pattern which initially was not obvious.&lt;ref&gt; http://informalcoalitions.typepad.com/informal_coalitions/2009/11/the-significance-of-humour-pattern-switching-and-lateral-thinking.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to de Bono, lateral thinking deliberately distances itself from the standard perception of creativity as "vertical" logic (the classic method for problem solving).

== Methods ==
To understand lateral thinking, it is necessary to compare lateral thinking and critical thinking. [[Critical thinking]] is primarily concerned with judging the true value of statements and seeking errors. Lateral thinking is more concerned with the "movement value" of statements and ideas. A person uses lateral thinking to move from one known idea to creating new ideas. Edward de Bono defines four types of thinking tools:
#idea-generating tools intended to break current thinking patterns—routine patterns, the [[status quo]]
#focus tools intended to broaden where to search for new ideas
#harvest tools intended to ensure more value is received from idea generating output
#treatment tools that promote consideration of real-world constraints, resources, and support&lt;ref&gt;''Lateral Thinking: The Power of Provocation'' manual: Published in 2006 by de Bono Thinking Systems&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=January 2015}}

;Random Entry Idea Generating Tool: The thinker chooses an object at random, or a noun from a dictionary, and associates it with the area they are thinking about. De Bono gives the example the randomly-chosen word "nose" being applied to an office photocopier, leading to the idea that the copier could produce a lavender smell when it was low on paper, to alert staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Serious Creativity: How to Be Creative Under Pressure and Turn Ideas into Action
|last = de Bono|first = Edward|publisher = Random House UK|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0091939700|location = |pages = 263}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Provocation Idea Generating Tool: A provocation is a statement that we know is wrong or impossible but is used to create new ideas. De Bono gives an example of considering river pollution and setting up the provocation "the factory is downstream of itself"; this leads to the idea of forcing a factory to take its water input from a point downstream of its output, an idea which later became law in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |last=De Bono |first=Edward |author-link=Edward De Bono |year=1992 |title=Serious creativity: using the power of lateral thinking to create new ideas |publisher=HarperBusiness |pages=145 |isbn=9780887305665 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbB9AAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provocations can be set up by the use of any of the [[Po (lateral thinking)|provocation techniques]]—wishful thinking, [[exaggeration]], reversal, escape, distortion, or arising. The thinker creates a list of provocations and then uses the most outlandish ones to move their thinking forward to new ideas.
;Movement Techniques: One can move from a provocation to a new idea by the following methods: extract a principle, focus on the difference, moment to moment, positive aspects, special circumstances.
;Challenge Idea Generating Tool: A tool which is designed to ask the question "Why?" in a non-threatening way: why something exists, why it is done the way it is. The result is a very clear understanding of "Why?" which naturally leads to fresh new ideas. The goal is to be able to challenge anything at all, not just items which are problems. For example, one could challenge the handles on [[coffee cup]]s: The reason for the handle seems to be that the cup is often too hot to hold directly; perhaps [[coffee]] cups could be made with insulated finger grips, or there could be separate coffee-cup holders similar to [[beer]] holders, or coffee shouldn't be so hot in the first place.
;Concept Fan Idea Generating Tool: Ideas carry out concepts. This tool systematically expands the range and number of concepts in order to end up with a very broad range of ideas to consider.
;Disproving: Based on the idea that the majority is always wrong (as suggested by [[Henrik Ibsen]]&lt;ref&gt;
In ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'', 1882.
&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of the Kennedys: The People and Events That Shaped America|last = Siracus|first = Joseph|publisher = ABC-CLIO|year = 2012|isbn = 1598845381|location = |pages = 269}}&lt;/ref&gt;), take anything that is obvious and generally accepted as "goes without saying", question it, take an opposite view, and try to convincingly disprove it. This technique is similar to de Bono's "Black Hat" of ''[[Six Thinking Hats]]'', which looks at identifying reasons to be cautious and conservative.

==Problem solving==
;Problem Solving: When something creates a problem, the performance or the status quo of the situation drops. Problem-solving deals with finding out what caused the problem and then figuring out ways to fix the problem. The objective is to get the situation to where it should be. For example, a production line has an established run rate of 1000 items per hour. Suddenly, the run rate drops to 800 items per hour. Ideas as to why this happened and solutions to repair the production line must be thought of, such as giving the worker a pay raise.

;Creative Problem Solving: Using [[creativity]], one must solve a problem in an indirect and unconventional manner. For example, if a production line produced 1000 books per hour, creative problem solving could find ways to produce more books per hour, use the production line, or reduce the cost to run the production line.

;Lateral Problem "Solving": Lateral thinking will often produce solutions whereby the problem appears as "obvious" in hindsight. That lateral thinking will often lead to problems that you never knew you had, or it will solve simple problems that have a huge potential. For example, if a production line produced 1000 books per hour, lateral thinking may suggest that a drop in output to 800 would lead to higher quality, and more motivated workers.

;Lateral thinking "puzzles": These are puzzles that are supposed to demonstrate what lateral thinking is about. However, any puzzle that has only one solution is "not" lateral. While lateral thinking may help you construct such puzzles, the lateral thinking tools will seldom help you solve puzzles.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

A '''legacy port''' is a [[computer port (hardware)|computer port]] or connector that is considered by some to be fully or partially superseded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/legacy ''definition of legacy from Oxford Dictionaries Online'']&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement ports usually provide most of the functionality of the legacy ports with higher speeds, more compact design, or [[plug and play]] and [[hot swap]] capabilities for greater ease of use. Modern PC [[motherboard]]s use separate [[Super I/O]] controllers to provide legacy ports since current [[chipset]]s do not offer direct support for them. A category of computers called [[legacy-free PC]]s omits these ports, typically retaining only USB for external expansion.

USB [[adapter (computing)|adapters]] are often used to provide legacy ports if they are required on systems not equipped with them.

'''Low-pressure discharges''' are discharges made under gas pressures from a few [[millitorr]] to a little less than atmospheric. They have the benefit of less power requirement of sustenance of the discharge as volume-recombination rates are lower.

It is easier to achieve uniform discharges at low pressure. Normally, the system is pumped down and only necessary plasma gases are then flown into the plasma chamber. [[Argon]] is a typical background gas because it has low ionization potential and therefore is easier to break down and sustain.

Most discharges used in the [[semiconductor industry]] employ low-pressure [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]].

'''Microsoft Corporation''' ('''MS''') is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[technology company]] with headquarters in [[Redmond, Washington]]. It develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells [[computer software]], [[consumer electronics]], [[personal computers]], and related services. Its best known software products are the [[Microsoft Windows]] line of [[operating system]]s, the [[Microsoft Office]] [[office suite|suite]], and the [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Microsoft Edge|Edge]] [[web browser]]s. Its flagship hardware products are the [[Xbox]] [[video game console]]s and the [[Microsoft Surface]] lineup of [[touchscreen]] personal computers.

Microsoft was founded by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell [[BASIC]] [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreters]] for the [[Altair 8800]]. It rose to dominate the [[personal computer]] operating system market with [[MS-DOS]] in the mid-1980s, followed by [[Microsoft Windows]]. The company's 1986 [[initial public offering]] (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the [[operating system]] market and has made a number of [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft|corporate acquisitions]], their largest being the acquisition of [[LinkedIn]] for $26.2 billion in December 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1271024/000110465916161289/a16-22816_18k.htm |title=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – Linkedin |date=December 8, 2016 |work=US SEC |access-date=April 29, 2018 |quote=As a result of the Merger, a change in control of [Linkedin] occurred and [Linkedin] became a wholly-owned subsidiary of [Microsoft].

Childhood friends [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] sought to make a [[business]] utilizing their shared skills in [[computer programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/bill-gates-9307520#early-life |title=Bill Gates |publisher=Biography.com |date= |accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 they founded their first company, named [[Traf-O-Data]], which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. While Gates enrolled at Harvard, Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State University, though he later dropped out of school to work at [[Honeywell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft Company History |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/microsoft-corporation-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' featured [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]]'s (MITS) [[Altair 8800]] [[microcomputer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/12/by_martin_finuc_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101055041/http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/12/by_martin_finuc_2.html |archivedate=January 1, 2009 |title=Harvard Square newsstand sold the magazine that started a revolution |work=[[Boston.com]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=December 30, 2008 |last=Finucane |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a [[BASIC]] [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for the device. After a call from Gates claiming to have a working interpreter, MITS requested a demonstration. Since they didn't yet have one, Allen worked on a [[simulation|simulator]] for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter. Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device, it worked flawlessly when they (in March 1975) demonstrated the interpreter to MITS in [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico. MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as [[Altair BASIC]].&lt;ref name="Allan 2001"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FLabRYnGrOcC |title=A History of the Personal Computer |last=Allan |first=Roy A. |publisher=Allan Publishing |isbn=0-9689108-0-7 |year=2001 |accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108, 112–114|date=November 2012}} Gates and Allen officially established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]].&lt;ref name="BBCTL"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5085630.stm |title=Bill Gates: A Timeline |work=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=BBC |date=July 15, 2006 |accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original name of "Micro-Soft" was suggested by Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/10/02/206528/index.htm |date=October 2, 1995 |title=Bill Gates &amp; Paul Allen Talk Check Out The Ultimate Buddy Act in Business History |work=[[Fortune Magazine]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |last=Schlender |first=Brent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Paul |date=2011 |title=Paul Allen: Idea Man |publisher=Penguin Group |page=91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0141969385 |isbn=0-14-196938-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1977 the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office, "[[ASCII Microsoft]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n8/192_Kay_Nishi_bridges_the_cul.php |title=Kay Nishi bridges the cultural gap |last=Staples |first=Betsy |journal=Creative Computing |volume=10 |issue=8 |page=192 |date=August 1984 |accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft moved to a new home in [[Bellevue, Washington]] in January 1979.&lt;ref name="BBCTL" /&gt;

Since IBM had [[copyright]]ed the IBM PC [[BIOS]], other companies had to [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as [[IBM PC compatible]]s, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems.

On July 27, 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division filed a Competitive Impact Statement that said, in part: "Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive "per processor" licenses. Under a per processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system.

As the smartphone industry boomed in 2007, Microsoft had struggled to keep up with its rivals [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]] in providing a modern smartphone operating system. As a result, in 2010 Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, [[Windows Mobile]], replacing it with the new [[Windows Phone]] OS. Microsoft implemented a new strategy for the software industry that had them working more closely with smartphone manufacturers, such as [[Nokia]], and providing a consistent user experience across all smartphones using the Windows Phone OS. It used a new user interface design language, codenamed "Metro", which prominently used simple shapes, typography and iconography, utilizing the concept of minimalism. Microsoft is a founding member of the [[Open Networking Foundation]] started on March 23, 2011. Fellow founders were [[Google]], [[HP Networking]], [[Yahoo]], [[Verizon]], [[Deutsche Telekom]] and 17 other companies.

In November, 2018, the company won a $480 million military contract with the U.S. government to bring [[Augmented reality|AR]] headset tech into the weapon repertoires of American soldiers. The two-year contract may result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets according to documentation describing the bidding process. One of the contract’s tag lines for the [[Augmented reality|AR]] tech seems to be its ability to enable “25 bloodless battles before the 1st battle,” suggesting that actual combat training is going to be an essential aspect of the [[Augmented reality|AR]] headset capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/28/microsoft-wins-480m-military-contract-to-outfit-soldiers-with-hololens-ar-tech/|title=Microsoft wins $480M military contract to outfit soldiers with HoloLens AR tech|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the [[total cost of ownership]] (TCO) of [[Windows Server 2003]] to [[Linux]]; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower TCO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/158237_msftresearch27.html |title=Studies on Linux help their patron: Microsoft |last=Bishop |first=Todd |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |publisher=Hearst Seattle Media, LLC |date=January 27, 2004 |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the [[Yankee Group]] concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the [[switching barriers|switching costs]] from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/operating_systems/yankee_independently_pits_windows_tco_vs_linux_tco.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104134612/http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/operating_systems/yankee_independently_pits_windows_tco_vs_linux_tco.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 4, 2013 |title=Yankee Independently Pits Windows TCO vs. Linux TCO |last=Foley |first=Mary Jo |work=eWeek |date=March 24, 2004 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, released by the [[Open Source Development Labs]], claimed that the Microsoft studies were "simply outdated and one-sided" and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2150210/linux-fans-hit-back-microsoft |title=Linux fans hit back at Microsoft TCO claims |last=Jaques |first=Robert |work=vnunet.com |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=August 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724013740/http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2150210/linux-fans-hit-back-microsoft |archivedate=July 24, 2008 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the "Get the Facts" campaign, Microsoft highlighted the [[.NET framework|.NET]] trading platform that it had developed in partnership with [[Accenture]] for the [[London Stock Exchange]], claiming that it provided "[[High availability|five nines]]" reliability. After suffering extended downtime and unreliability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/4676369/Seven-hour-LSE-blackout-caused-by-double-glitch.html |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |title=Seven-hour LSE blackout caused by double glitch |first=Rowena |last=Mason |date=September 10, 2008 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8380607.stm |title=London Stock Exchange trading hit by technical glitch |date=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the LSE announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux-based one in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=ITWire |url=http://www.itwire.com/opinion-and-analysis/the-linux-distillery/28359-london-stock-exchange-gets-the-facts-and-dumps-windows-for-linux |title=London Stock Exchange gets the facts and dumps Windows for Linux |first=David M. |last=Williams |date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Slashdot]] |url=http://linux.slashdot.org/story/09/10/06/1742203/London-Stock-Exchange-Rejects-NET-For-Open-Source |title=London Stock Exchange Rejects .NET For Open Source |date=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom the ''New York Times'' called "famous for bulldozing" his political opponents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/15/technology/microsoft-battles-google-by-hiring-political-brawler-mark-penn.html?_r=0 |work=The New York Times |first1=Nick |last1=Wingfield |title=Microsoft Battles Google by Hiring Political Brawler Mark Penn |date=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Executive Vice-President, Advertising and Strategy. Penn created a series of negative ads targeting one of Microsoft's chief competitors, [[Google]]. The ads, called "[[Scroogled]]", attempt to make the case that Google is "screwing" consumers with search results rigged to favor Google's paid advertisers, that [[Gmail]] violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results which favor Google products. Tech publications like TechCrunch have been highly critical of the ad campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/10/scroogled-why-so-negative-microsoft/ |title=Scroogled: Why So Negative, Microsoft? |publisher=TechCrunch |date=February 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Google employees have embraced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/11/21/googlers-love-microsofts-scroogled-gear-mug-and-shirts-sell-out/ |title=Googlers Love Microsoft's 'Scroogled' Gear.

=== Layoffs ===
{{Main|Criticism of Microsoft}}
In July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft lay off ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft has laid off 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with [[Great Recession|US financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/07/17/microsoft-cut-18000-jobs-over-next-year.html |title=Microsoft to cut up to 18,000 jobs over next year |date=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="layoff"&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft Layoffs Greater Than Expected: Up to 18,000 Jobs Being Cut |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-layoffs-greater-than-expected-up-to-18-0/1100-6421171/ |publisher=Gamespot |accessdate=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle-Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brings the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts.&lt;ref&gt;By Alex Wilhelm, TechCrunch.

As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of approximately $950 million, of which approximately $200 million will relate to severance payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-announces-streamlining-of-smartphone-hardware-business-300274560.html |title=Microsoft announces streamlining of smartphone hardware business |first=Microsoft |last=Corp. |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States government ===
{{Main|Criticism of Microsoft}}
Microsoft provides information about reported bugs in their software to intelligence agencies of the United States government, prior to the public release of the fix. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that the corporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms.html |title=U.S. Agencies Said to Swap Data With Thousands of Firms |work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following media reports about [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], NSA's massive electronic [[Mass surveillance|surveillance program]], in May 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan W. |last=Neal |title=Snowden Reveals Microsoft PRISM Cooperation: Helped NSA Decrypt Emails, Chats, Skype Conversations |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/snowden-reveals-microsoft-prism-cooperation-helped-nsa-decrypt-emails-chats-skype-conversations |work=[[International Business Times]] |date=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to leaks of said program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Greenwald |first1=Glenn |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |title=NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others |date=June 7, 2013 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data |accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2013, an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied their participation in the program:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don't participate in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Kevin |last2=Martin |first2=Scott |last3=O'Donnell |first3=Jayne |last4=Winter |first4=Michael |title=Reports: NSA Siphons Data from 9 Major Net Firms |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/06/06/nsa-surveillance-internet-companies/2398345/ |accessdate=June 6, 2013 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the first six months in 2013, Microsoft had received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999 accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Yahoo release US surveillance requests |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/03/microsoft-facebook-google-yahoo-fisa-surveillance-requests |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, the company made statement to further emphasize the fact that they take their customers' privacy and [[Information privacy|data protection]] very seriously, even saying that "government snooping potentially now constitutes an "[[advanced persistent threat]]," alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Brad |title=Protecting customer data from government snooping |url=http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2013/12/04/protecting-customer-data-from-government-snooping/ |website=The Official Microsoft Blog |accessdate=January 1, 2015 |date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft's encryption and transparency efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program they opened the first (of many) Microsoft Transparency Center, that provides "participating governments with the ability to review [[source code]] for our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no "[[Backdoor (computing)|back doors]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thomlinson |first1=Matt |title=Advancing our encryption and transparency efforts |url=http://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2014/07/01/advancing-our-encryption-and-transparency-efforts/ |website=Microsoft on the Issues |accessdate=January 1, 2015 |date=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has also argued that the [[United States Congress]] should enact strong privacy regulations to protect consumer data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heiner |first1=David |title=Request for Comment: Big Data and Consumer Privacy in the Internet Economy |url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/microsoft.pdf |website=National Telecommunications and Information Administration |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, the company [[Microsoft v. United States (2016 lawsuit)|sued the U.S. government]], arguing that secrecy orders were preventing the company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company's and customers' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents, and that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DoJ). The DoJ had "changed data request rules on alerting internet users about agencies accessing their information."  The new policy mandated defined periods of time for secrecy orders from the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://venturebeat.com/2017/10/24/microsoft-drops-lawsuit-after-doj-revises-data-request-transparency-rules/ "Microsoft drops lawsuit after U.S. government revises data request transparency rules"], VentureBeat, Reuters, October 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Headquarters ===
The corporate headquarters, informally known as the [[Microsoft Redmond campus]], is located at [[One Microsoft Way]] in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment. It is estimated to encompass over 8 million ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (750,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of office space and 30,000–40,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/inside_ms.mspx Fast Facts About Microsoft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809015659/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/inside_ms.mspx |date=August 9, 2007 }}.

On October 26, 2015, the company opened its flagship retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The location features a five-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Your First Look at Microsoft's Massive New Flagship Store |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/microsofts-hands-on-flagship-store-opens-on-fifth-avenue/ |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per company executives, Microsoft had been on the lookout for a flagship location since 2009.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |last=Morris |first=Keiko |title=Microsoft Opens Flagship Store on Fifth Avenue |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-opens-flagship-store-on-fifth-avenue-1445823629 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal|access-date=October 27, 2015 |issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's retail locations are part of a greater

=== Logo ===
Microsoft adopted the so-called "''[[Pac-Man]]'' Logo", designed by Scott Baker, in 1987. Baker stated "The new logo, in [[Helvetica]] italic typeface, has a slash between the ''o'' and ''s'' to emphasize the "soft" part of the name and convey motion and speed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jha |first=Lakshman |date=2008 |title=Customer Relationship Management: A Strategic Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbnZwhUjlF0C |publisher=Global India Publications |page=218 |isbn=978-81-907211-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter ''O'', nicknamed the ''blibbet'', but it was discarded.&lt;ref name="Osterman2005-07-14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/07/14/438777.aspx |title=Remember the blibbet |work=Larry Osterman's WebLog |publisher=Microsoft |last=Osterman |first=Larry |date=July 14, 2005 |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's logo with the tagline "''Your potential. Our passion.''"{{snd}} below the main corporate name{{snd}} is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of ''"[[Where do you want to go today?]]"''&lt;ref name="wherego1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="potentialpassion1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reimer"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060123-6031.html |title=Microsoft set to launch new marketing campaign |work=Ars Technica |publisher=Condé Nast Digital |last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |date=January 23, 2006 |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company's next tagline, ''"Be What's Next."''&lt;ref name="2010logo"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/07/22/new-microsoft-brand-logos-company-tagline-revealed-at-mgx-event/ |title=New Microsoft brand logos, company tagline revealed at MGX event?

On August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store in Boston, indicating the company's shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern interface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the upcoming Office Suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Meisner |first=Jeffrey |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2012/08/23/microsoft-unveils-a-new-look.aspx |title=Microsoft Unveils a New Look |publisher=The Official Microsoft Blog |date=August 23, 2012 |accessdate=August 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825012157/http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2012/08/23/microsoft-unveils-a-new-look.aspx |archivedate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current Windows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft's four major products: Windows (blue), Office (red), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eric |first=Steven H. |url=http://flapship.com/new-microsoft-logo-revealed/ |title=NEW MICROSOFT LOGO REVEALED |publisher=Flapship.com |date=August 23, 2012 |accessdate=August 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825174050/http://flapship.com/new-microsoft-logo-revealed/ |archivedate=August 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo resembles the opening of one of the commercials for [[Windows 95]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpcentral.com/microsofts-new-logo-has-ties-past |title=Microsoft's new logo has ties to the past}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft039s-logo-is-not-new-it039s-from-1995 |title=Microsoft's logo is not new, it's from 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobile Telecommunication Company of Esfahan''' (شرکت مخابرات سیار اصفهان, '''MTCE''') also known as '''Espadan''' was a [[mobile network operator]] in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=8511728|title=Mobile Telecommunications Company of Esfahan: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ihs.com/country-industry-forecasting.html?ID=106599432|title=Iran to License Third Nationwide Cellular Operator|website=www.ihs.com|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the agreements reached during the Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani's visit to Malaysia in 1994, and according to the laws of attracting and supporting foreign investment, in 29 May 2001 the license for launching the first [[Prepay mobile phone|prepaid mobile telephone]] network in Iran with an initial capacity of 20 thousand subscribers was granted to [[Celcom]] for 15 years, and the Malaysian Technology Resources Industry Company received permission to use [[GSM]] 24.18 Mbit/s bandwidth within the [[Isfahan]] province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mtce.ir/contactus/about-us.dot|title=درباره ما - MTCE|date=2016-04-02|access-date=2017-11-25|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402164244/http://mtce.ir/contactus/about-us.dot|archivedate=2016-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== History ===
Pedago was founded by Tom Adams, Alexie Harper, and Ori Ratner in May 2013 in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2015/5/18/11562702/are-d-c-startups-seeding-the-next-american-revolution|title=Are D.C.

=== Business model ===
The Smartly MBA and EMBA programs currently offer a free online platform for studying and to connect students with worldwide employers. The business model is based on receiving financing from employers searching for MBA graduates sourced from its selective program, allowing it to cut down on [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] in the case of traditional recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/how-washingtons-entrepreneurs-are-revolutionising-way-we-learn|title=How Washington’s entrepreneurs are revolutionising the way we learn|last=McGivan|first=Tom|date=2016-05-09|website=Virgin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliated hiring organizations already include [[Square, Inc.|Square]], [[Capital One]], and smaller startups like [[DoorDash|Door Dash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivalegatt/2018/04/03/why-simone-biles-chose-online-over-ucla/#a25402731936|title=Why Simone Biles Chose An Online College Over UCLA|last=Legatt|first=Aviva|date=2018-04-03|website=Forbes|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedago is largely funded by Tom Adams and a few unnamed external investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americaninno.com/dc/first-look-dc/ex-rosetta-stone-ceo-tom-adams-launches-app-for-mba-smartly/|title=First Look: Rosetta Stone’s Former CEO Is Launching an Edtech App|last=Bing|first=Chris|date=2015-08-19|website=American Inno|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnerships ===
It has also partnered with [[Uber]] to train its drivers in Africa and to help incoming MBA students in [[Georgetown University]] prepare them in introductory courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2016/09/23/pedago-a-quick-and-free-mba-program-video.html|title=Pedago: A quick — and free — MBA program|last=Medici|first=Andy|date=2016-09-23|website=Washington Business Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

=== Smartly ===
Pedago's first product is the Smartly platform, which offers both an MBA and EMBA program through its [[Web application|web]] and [[mobile app]]lication, combining interactive problem solving with instant feedback while using the [[active learning]] method. Instead of using video as its primary medium of delivering its content often seen in many MOOCs, it focuses on delivering its lessons through piecemeal concepts. All Smartly MBA applicants are required to possess a bachelor's degree or possess previous business experience in lieu of a bachelor's degree, as well as an essay component and completion of its business foundation courses in order to be accepted as a candidate. Applicants are required to submit [[Transcript (education)|academic transcripts]] upon acceptance, similar to traditional university [[matriculation]] procedures.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The MBA core curriculum consists of sections divided according to various functional departments in an organization, including accounting, finance, [[marketing]], [[supply chain management]], and [[Strategic management|strategy]]. Communication is also done through [[Slack (software)|Slack]] with weekly discussion for candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themillennialplan.com/2018/03/07/smartly-mba-the-final-say/|title=Smartly MBA: The Final Say|last=|first=|date=2018-03-07|website=The Millennial Plan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optional elective courses are also offered in topics including [[game theory]], [[intellectual property|IP]] laws, [[Mergers and acquisitions|M&amp;A]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and [[vertical integration]] as well as up and coming topics in [[entrepreneurship]], [[e-commerce]], and [[data science]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6860">'''Peptide amphiphiles''' are [[peptide]]-based molecules that [[Self-assembly of nanoparticles|self-assemble]] into structures including high aspect ratio [[nanofiber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hamley IW. "Self-Assembly of Amphiphilic Peptides." {{doi|10.1039/C0SM01218A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dehsorkhi A, Castelletto V, Hamley IW. "Self-Assembling Amphiphilic Peptides." {{doi|10.1002/psc.2633}}&lt;/ref&gt; A peptide amphiphile typically comprises a hydrophilic peptide sequence with an attached lipid chains, in this case being a [[lipopeptide]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamley, I.W. Lipopeptides: From Self-Assembly to Bioactivity. Chem. Comm. 2015, 51, 8574-8583. {{doi| 10.1039/c5cc01535a}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were first described by the group of [[Matthew Tirrell]] in 1995. These molecules are often composed of multiple domains which allow self-assembly into various supramolecular structures. The individual domains associate with each other and result in growth of larger assemblies. Work by Hartgerink et al. in the early 2000s demonstrated a peptide amphiphile which has three regions: a hydrophobic tail, a region of beta-sheet forming amino acids, and a peptide epitope designed to allow solubility of the molecule in water, perform a biological function by interacting with living systems, or both.  Self-assembly occurs by the combination of hydrogen-bonding between beta-sheet forming amino acids and hydrophobic collapse of the tails to yield the formation of cylindrical [[micelles]] that present the peptide epitope at extremely high density at the nanofiber surface. In a newer system developed by Hartgerink in the mid 2000s, multidomain peptides consisting nominally of alternating [[hydrophobic]] and [[hydrophilic]] amino acids, with terminal lysines self-assemble into parallel or anti-parallel beta sheets. This self-assembly of molecules into fibers occurs spontaneously in all solutions of peptide amphiphiles, which have a vanishingly small critical micelle concentration. By changing pH or adding counterions to screen the charged surfaces of fibers, gels can be formed.  It has been shown that injection of peptide amphiphile solutions in vivo leads to in situ gel formation due to the presence of counterions in physiological solutions. This, along with the complete biodegradability of the materials, suggests numerous applications in in vitro and in vivo therapies.

The modular nature of the chemistry allows the tuning of both the mechanical properties and bioactivities of the resulting self-assembled fibers and gels. Bioactive sequences can be used to bind growth factors to localize and present them at high densities to cells, or to directly mimic the function of endogenous biomolecules. Epitopes mimicking the adhesive [[RGD motif|RGD loop]] in [[fibronectin]], the IKVAV sequence in [[laminin]] and a consensus sequence to bind [[heparin sulfate]] are just a few of the large library of sequences that have been synthesized. These molecules and the materials made from them have been shown to be effective in promoting cell adhesion, wound healing, mineralization of bone, differentiation of cells and even recovery of function after spinal cord injury in mice.

In addition to this, peptide amphiphiles can be used to form more sophisticated architectures which can be tuned on demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samad|first=Mehdi Bin|last2=Chhonker|first2=Yashpal Singh|last3=Contreras|first3=Jacob I.|last4=McCarthy|first4=Alec|last5=McClanahan|first5=Megan M.|last6=Murry|first6=Daryl J.|last7=Conda-Sheridan|first7=Martin|date=2017-05-16|title=Developing Polyamine-Based Peptide Amphiphiles with Tunable Morphology and Physicochemical Properties|journal=Macromolecular Bioscience|doi=10.1002/mabi.201700096|issn=1616-5195|pmid=28509362}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, two discoveries have yielded bioactive materials with more advanced structures and potential applications.  In one study, a thermal treatment of peptide amphiphile solutions led to the formation of large birefringent domains in the material that could be aligned by a weak shear force into one continuous monodomain gel of aligned nanofibers. The low shear forces used in aligning the material permit the encapsulation of living cells inside these aligned gels and suggest several applications in regenerating tissues that rely on cell polarity and alignment for function. In another study, the combination of positively charged peptide amphiphiles and negatively charged long [[biopolymer]]s led to the formation of hierarchically ordered membranes. When the two solutions are brought into contact, electrostatic complexation between the components of each solution creates a diffusion barrier that prevents the mixing of the solutions. Over time, an osmotic pressure difference drives the reptation of polymer chains through the diffusion barrier into the peptide amphiphile compartment, leading to the formation of fibers perpendicular to the interface that grow over time. These materials can be made in the form of flat membranes or as spherical sacs by dropping one solution into the other. These materials are robust enough to handle mechanically and a range of mechanical properties can be accessed by altering growth conditions and time.  They can incorporate bioactive peptide amphiphiles, encapsulate cells and biomolecules, and are biocompatible and biodegradable.

'''RingGo''' is a [[pay by phone parking]] service, based in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.burtonmail.co.uk/news/local-news/parking-burton-railway-station-can-1422111|title=New passenger parking scheme at Burton Railway Station|last=Pridding|first=Beth|date=2018-04-13|work=burtonmail|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It processes over 2 million phone parking transactions a month and over 6 million individual UK motorists have used the service.  Offered in public car parks and on-street locations across the [[United Kingdom]] it is now deployed in support of over 100 local authorities.  The first major implementation (from June 2006) was for the [[First Great Western]] Railway in 60 stations. The project by the [[FirstGroup]], was an early step in the trend away from the established system of paying for parking using electro-mechanical machines which dispense paper tickets – the [[pay and display]] model.

Railways were a major area of early stage growth.  Franchises that adopted the service included [[Network Rail]], [[Chiltern Railways]], [[South West Trains]], [[First Capital Connect]], [[National Express East Anglia]], [[c2c]], [[First TransPennine Express]], [[Arriva Trains Wales]] and [[East Coast Railway]].  The service has also been offered in [[National Car Parks|NCP]] operated and managed car parks since March 2010.

Parking was an early area in which [[electronic money]] as opposed to cash-money made considerable advances although it has been overtaken since in sectors such as mass transportation.

On 1 October 2009, Richmond Council introduced variable parking charges which were linked to the [[carbon dioxide emissions]] of vehicles parking there (carbon metered parking).  Payment of the service was either via RingGo or by a Richmond [[smart card]], which could be used in the machine.

Milton Keynes Council, Richmond Council, Lewisham Council and, from November 2014, Westminster council provide online parking permits that are an extension of the RingGo phone parking service

The RingGo brand is owned by Cobalt Telephone Technologies Ltd, a UK private company headquartered in Basingstoke, Hampshire. Cobalt was acquired by the [[Parkmobile Group]] in August 2012.  The Parkmobile group is a global specialist in phone parking and has similar operations in support of cities, railways and municipalities in North America, The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3220">The '''Sony eVilla''' is a discontinued [[Internet appliance]] from [[Sony]]. After 18 months of development, it was released to the public on June 14, 2001 for $499 [[United States dollar|USD]]. With the additional $21.95 USD monthly fee, users could access the [[Internet]], send and receive [[e-mail]], play audio and video, and save files to Sony's [[Memory Stick]].

After less than three months in the market, Sony discontinued the product on September 13, 2001. Customers received full refunds for the product and the monthly subscription fee.  Spokesman John Dolak remarked that "[the] product did not meet our expectations, it did not operate as planned."

Sony entered the Internet appliance market as other manufacturers were getting out, canceling their plans, and discontinuing their offerings. By the time the Sony eVilla shipped, only 150,000 internet appliance devices had shipped within the past year. In addition, many customers could not justify the purchase of an inherently limited internet appliance when other manufacturers were offering more capable [[personal computers]] for the same price.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Hardware and software==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sony eVilla screenshot.png|thumb|Screenshot of the Sony eVilla interface.]] --&gt;
The Sony eVilla was powered by a 266&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Geode (processor)|Geode]] GX 1 [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]], with 64 [[mebibyte|MiB]] [[Dynamic Random Access Memory|DRAM]], and 24 MiB [[flash memory]]. It weighed 31.5 pounds (14.3&amp;nbsp;kg) and measured 11.81 × 16.18 × 15.82&amp;nbsp;inches (30 × 41.1 x 40.2&amp;nbsp;cm).

There was no [[hard disk]], but the system could read and write to Sony's [[Memory Stick]] cards. The included [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] were connected by two [[DIN connector|PS/2 ports]], and additional devices could be connected with two [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports. A 56K [[V.90 (recommendation)|V.90]] [[modem]] was built into the case, which also housed an unused [[Ethernet]] port.

The display was a portrait-style 15&amp;nbsp;inch (38&amp;nbsp;cm) Sony [[Trinitron]], with 800×1024 pixel resolution.

The system used the [[BeIA]] 1.0 [[operating system]] from [[Be Inc.]], and supported [[Java platform|Java]] applications, [[Macromedia Flash]] animations, and some [[Microsoft Office]] file formats. Also included was [[RealNetworks]]'s [[RealPlayer]].

One of the major drawbacks of the eVilla was the inability to save pictures and media from internet sites.

==Early life and education==
Born Susan Elizabeth Burrows on 3 February 1955 in Cumbria,&lt;ref name="Pitman, Jenny (April 2013)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pitman|first1=Jenny|title=Woman's Hour: Jenny Pitman; Sue Ion goes back to school|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rlsv0|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2015-08-31|date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is the daughter of Lawrence James Burrows, a planning officer for British Rail, and Doris Burrows (née Cherry), a secretary.&lt;ref name="Taylor, Jeremy (January 2014)"/&gt;

Ion was educated at [[Penwortham Girls' High School|Penwortham Girls Grammar School]] near [[Preston, Lancashire]] in the same year as [[Nancy Rothwell]].&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili, Jim (February 2013)"/&gt; As a young student, she enjoyed science, which her parents encouraged by letting her do chemistry experiments in the family's kitchen.&lt;ref name="Taylor, Jeremy (January 2014)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pozniak, Helena (October 2014)"/&gt;

At school, she took a leadership role as Head Girl from 1972 to 1973 and deputy leader of the orchestra. At 16, Ion won a book on atomic energy as a prize for her O-levels in science, which helped inspire her enthusiasm for the topic.&lt;ref name="Pozniak, Helena (October 2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pozniak|first1=Helena|title=Great minds don't all think alike: Current heroes of STEM prove that ideas can come in any shape or form, finds Helena Pozniak|work=The Sunday Telegraph|date=26 October 2014|location=London, UK|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recalled, "When I was in school ... it was quite different. You were given every encouragement possible to do science subjects if you were interested in them".&lt;ref name="Zolfagharifard, Ellie (May 2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitman, Jenny (April 2013)"/&gt;

Ion went on to study [[Materials Science]] at [[Imperial College London]],&lt;ref name="whoswho"/&gt; gaining a first class [[Bachelor of Science]] degree{{when|date=November 2017}} and a PhD in [[Metallurgy]] in 1979 supervised by F.J. Humphreys and S.H. White.&lt;ref name="Taylor, Jeremy (January 2014)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ionphd"&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|first=Susan Elizabeth|last=Burrows|title=Dynamic recrystallisation in a magnesium alloy|publisher=Imperial College London|year=1979|url=https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/7335|website=imperial.ac.uk|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.450313}}|hdl=10044/1/7335|oclc=930652385}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pagano, Margareta (October 2014)"/&gt;

She taught in an inner-city school in London while completing her doctorate, and used supplies from the college laboratories in her lessons to help students become enthusiastic about the industry. "Where there is no vision ... the people perish", she says.&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili, Jim (February 2013)"/&gt;

==Career and research==
[[Image:Dame Sue Ion at QED Question Explore Discover conference 2015 01.jpg|thumb|right|At the 2015 [[Merseyside Skeptics Society#QED: Question, Explore, Discover|QED conference]] in Manchester]]
In 1979, Ion was first hired as a technical officer at [[BNFL|British Nuclear Fuels]] (BNFL). At the time, she and one other woman were the only females working in the chemical engineering department.&lt;ref name="Taylor, Jeremy (January 2014)"/&gt;

In 1992, she was promoted to Executive Director of Technology,&lt;ref name="Lipsett, Anthea M. (March 2004)"/&gt; a position Ion held within the organisation until 2006.&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili, Jim (February 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zolfagharifard, Ellie (May 2010)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zolfagharifard|first1=Ellie|title=Dame Sue Ion, veteran nuclear fuels expert|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/in-depth/interviews/dame-sue-ion-veteran-nuclear-fuels-expert/1002072.article|accessdate=2015-08-23|work=The Engineer|date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pagano, Margareta (October 2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pagano|first1=Margareta|title=If Engineering is hot, will it expand to meet demand for new recruits?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/if-engineering-is-hot-will-it-expand-to-meet-demand-for-new-recruits-9774251.html|accessdate=2015-08-22|work=The Independent|date=4 October 2014|location=London, UK|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipsett, Anthea M. (March 2004)"/&gt;

During this time, nuclear or atomic energy was viewed as a valuable source of energy, along with the existing coal industry, and a necessary part of rebuilding post-war Britain. It was, according to Ion, an exciting industry with a vibrant research and development program and great prospects. As she told [[Jim Al-Khalili]] in a 2013 interview for [[BBC Radio Four]], "Nothing over time has changed my view of that".&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili, Jim (February 2013)"/&gt;

As technical director of BNFL, Ion held a seat on [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Council for Science and Technology]] and has been credited with persuading Blair to change Labour's official government's policy on nuclear power.&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili, Jim (February 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pagano, Margareta (October 2014)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sunday Times (March 2014)"&gt;{{cite news|title=100 Makers of the 21st Century: Welcome to the second of a three-part special, featuring 25 more of the 100 most influential Britons of the modern age: the people who, for better or worse, are shaping our lives|work=Sunday Times|date=15 March 2014|location=London, UK|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ion's work, along with [[David King (chemist)|David King]], took about 10 years of educating government officials to consider the scientific evidence surrounding the issues of nuclear power and renewable energy to inform policy.&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili, Jim (February 2013)"/&gt; She helped advise [[Gordon Brown]] on long-term energy policies.&lt;ref name="Zolfagharifard, Ellie (May 2010)"/&gt;

In 2004, Ion was among 180 women invited to a "Women's Theme Day" luncheon at [[Buckingham Palace]] in recognition of her contributions to the field of science and technology.&lt;ref name="The Times (March 2004)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Buckingham Palace women's lunch|work=The Times|issue=Final 2 Edition|date=12 March 2004|location=London (UK)|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian (March 2004)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lunch with the high achievers|work=The Guardian|date=12 March 2004|location=London (UK)|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mouland, Bill (March 2004)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mouland|first1=Bill|title=All the Queen's Women; Punk priestess, prima donnas and TV stars – the 'Women of Excellence' invited to the Palace yesterday|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-114185276.html|accessdate=2015-08-22|work=Daily Mail|date=12 March 2004|location=London (UK)|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jobson, Robert (March 2004)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jobson|first1=Robert|title=All the Queen's women; 180 attend special lunch at the Palace|url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-114140329/all-the-queen-s-women-180-attend-special-lunch-at|accessdate=2015-08-22|work=London Evening Standard|date=11 March 2004|location=London (UK)|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ion was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering]] (FREng) in 1996 and was a vice-president from 2002 to 2008.&lt;ref name="WES"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sue Ion|url=http://www.wes.org.uk/content/sue-ion|publisher=WES|accessdate=2015-09-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925010639/http://www.wes.org.uk/content/sue-ion|archivedate=25 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Ion was appointed visiting professor of Imperial College&lt;ref name="Zolfagharifard, Ellie (May 2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pitman, Jenny (April 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pagano, Margareta (October 2014)"/&gt; and admitted to the Fellowship of the college in 2005.&lt;ref name="Imperial College (October 2005)"&gt;{{cite web|title=Imperial College London bestows its highest honours in Commemoration Day ceremony|url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/college.asp?P=6989|website=Imperial.ak.uk|publisher=Imperial College London|accessdate=2015-09-18|date=26 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear power and renewable energy===
[[File:QEDCon Day One-94 (17333369312).jpg|thumb|Sue Ion at QEDCon]]
Ion has studied energy supplies for more than 30 years. She spent a lot of time early in her career advising government officials about nuclear reactors and countering the negativity caused by the incidents at [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] and [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]].&lt;ref name="Al-Khalili, Jim (February 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor, Jeremy (January 2014)"/&gt;

{{Quotation|"People worry about nuclear waste, but modern power stations create much less than in the past. I'd certainly have no hesitation living next door to one."|Sue Ion&lt;ref name="Taylor, Jeremy (January 2014)"/&gt;}}
Ion supports the development of smaller, modular versions of nuclear reactors for their economy of size, portability and cost.&lt;ref name="Taylor, Jeremy (January 2014)"/&gt; These smaller reactors would, most likely, be housed on existing nuclear sites licensed for that purpose.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer, Sylvia (February 2013)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pfeifer|first1=Sylvia|title=Flexible Fission: Nuclear|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/71d62476-706e-11e2-ab31-00144feab49a.html|accessdate=2015-09-17|work=Financial Times|date=15 February 2013|location=London, UK|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ion views her biggest challenge is "persuading decades-worth of politicians that nuclear energy is really needed."&lt;ref name="Pozniak, Helena (October 2014)"/&gt; Her position is that renewable energy sources (particularly wind power), coal and nuclear power will be necessary components of Britain's energy policy moving forward.&lt;ref name="The Times (October 2010)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anonymous|title=Sue Ion: Age 55. No. 96 – Gone Nuclear|work=The Times|date=7 October 2010|location=London, UK|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finnigan, Salter and Brett (Nov 2010)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Finnigan|first1=Kate|last2=Salter|first2=Kate|last3=Brett|first3=Gillian|title=100 most powerful women in Britain: From the towering figures of law, medicine and politics to the familiar faces of television, film and fashion, we reveal the women who wield the most influence – visibly or invisibly – over our lives today|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/8133796/100-most-powerful-women-in-Britain-Entertainment-Media-and-Sport.html|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=The Sunday Telegraph|date=14 November 2010|location=London, UK|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science education and gender stereotypes===
In Ion's outreach as a spokesperson for the nuclear power industry, she has expressed a belief that more needs to be done to attract women into the field of engineering.&lt;ref name="Hodges, Lucy (February 2002)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hodges|first1=Lucy|title=Survival of the fittest, or an old boys' club?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/survival-of-the-fittest-or-an-old-boys-club-9169696.html|accessdate=2015-08-31|work=The Independent|issue=Foreign edition|date=14 February 2002|location=London, UK|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has expressed concerns that some areas of the educational system still view engineering as a subject only for males.&lt;ref name="Pitman, Jenny (April 2013)"/&gt;

While major institutions may support the idea of females entering the field of science and engineering, Ion notes that grade schools under the current system may not provide the prerequisite coursework early enough in students' academic careers for them to be successful at university.&lt;ref name="Pitman, Jenny (April 2013)"/&gt;{{Quotation|"I get into terrible trouble when I visit schools to talk to students – especially girls – as I tell them not to dump the sciences because they are difficult. So many choose the softer, creative subjects but I tell them they can still do those subjects later on – what you can't do is go back and study the sciences. They all look glum after I give those talks but they've got to be told."|Sue Ion&lt;ref name="Pagano, Margareta (October 2014)"/&gt;}}

Ion supports educational programs that support all students, regardless of gender, to explore science and develop the skills necessary to replace what the Royal Academy of Engineering views as a retiring workforce. In response to a report commissioned by the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) discussing the UK's plans for future energy production, she cautions: "There will be an unprecedented demand for new infrastructure to support the changes in the energy industry. There are not enough people going into university to study engineering and provide all the turbine specialists, heavy electrical engineers and construction engineers that will be required".&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph (May 2007)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hotten|first1=Russell|title=Reaction intentions are good, but can it deliver in time, asks the critics|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 May 2007|location=London, UK|page=005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leake, Jonathan (November 2006)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leake|first1=Jonathan|title=Switching on to the nuclear option|work=Sunday Times|issue=Final 1 Edition|date=26 November 2006|location=London, UK|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|"Grab every chance you've got to watch and learn from others. Take control of your career and ask for the development moves and the experiences that you feel will get you ahead."|Sue Ion&lt;ref name="Pozniak, Helena (October 2014)"/&gt;}}

[[Image:Supernode in circuit analysis.svg|thumb|right|182px|In this circuit, both ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; are supernodes. ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; has two unreferenced nodes, whereas ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; has one referenced node (ground) and one unreferenced node.]]
In [[circuit theory]], a '''supernode''' is a theoretical construct that can be used to solve a circuit.  This is done by viewing a [[voltage]] source on a wire as a point source voltage in relation to other point voltages located at various nodes in the circuit, relative to a [[ground (electricity)|ground]] node assigned a zero or negative charge.

Each supernode contains two nodes, one non-reference node and another node that may be a second non-reference node or the reference node. Supernodes containing the reference node have one node voltage variable. For [[nodal analysis]], the supernode construct is only required between two non-reference nodes.

==Nodal Analysis==

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is related to Kirchhoff's Current Law which states that the total or algebraic sum of currents meeting at a junction or node is zero. Every junction where two or more branches meet is a node. One of the nodes in the network is taken as reference node. If there are n nodes in any network, the number of simultaneous equation to be solved will be (n-1).&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Electronics-stub}}

'''Sustainability declarations''' are [[checklist]]s of sustainability features that were a requirement to be completed by home-owners and vendors in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] before a home can be sold.&lt;ref&gt;http://andrewhenderson.blog.professionalsmermaidbeach.com.au/?p=126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainabilitydeclarationform.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;
The checklist identifies the property's environmental and social sustainability features in the four areas of energy, water, safety, and access.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dip.qld.gov.au/sustainable-housing/sustainability-declaration.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Home owners must complete these sustainability checklists or risk being fined up to $4000. Advertising for homes must also include details about where the Sustainability Declaration for the property can be viewed.&lt;ref&gt;http://andrewhenderson.blog.professionalsmermaidbeach.com.au/?p=126&lt;/ref&gt; Properties that have a larger number of sustainability features generate fewer greenhouse gas emissions, use less energy for heating and cooling, use less water and are more comfortable to live in. They also can have fewer operating costs and be more energy and water efficient.

Sustainability Declaration now no longer needed for Queensland home owners August 2012

'''Sustainable transport''' refers to the broad subject of [[transport]] that is [[sustainability|sustainable]] in the senses of social, [[Environmental issue|environmental]] and [[climate change|climate]] impacts and the ability to, in the global scope, supply the source energy indefinitely. Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular [[vehicle|vehicles]] used for road, water or air transport; the source of [[energy]]; and the [[infrastructure]] used to accommodate the transport ([[road|roads]], [[rail transport|railways]], [[airway (aviation)|airways]], [[waterway|waterways]], [[canal|canals]] and terminals). Transport operations and [[logistics]] as well as [[transit-oriented development]] are also involved in evaluation. Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency as well as the [[environmental impact|environmental]] and [[climate change|climate]] impacts of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Short-term activity often promotes incremental improvement in [[fuel efficiency]] and [[vehicle emissions control]]s while long-term goals include migrating transportation from fossil-based energy to other alternatives such as [[renewable energy]] and use of other [[renewable resource]]s. The entire life cycle of transport systems is subject to [[sustainability measurement]] and optimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Sustainable transport systems make a positive contribution to the environmental, social and economic [[sustainability]] of the communities they serve. Transport systems exist to provide social and economic connections, and people quickly take up the opportunities offered by increased [[mobilities|mobility]],&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, A. (1998) "The global demand for motorized mobility." ''Transportation Research A'' '''32'''(6), 455-477.&lt;/ref&gt; with poor households benefiting  greatly from [[low carbon]] transport options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-fight-poverty/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS  in Practice: Fight poverty|work=[[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of increased mobility need to be weighed against the environmental, social and economic costs that transport systems pose.

Transport systems have significant impacts on the environment, accounting for between 20% and 25% of [[world energy consumption]] and [[carbon dioxide emissions]].&lt;ref name="world energy council"&gt;"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldenergy.org/publications/809.asp |title=Transport Technologies and Policy Scenarios |publisher=[[World Energy Council]] |accessdate=2009-05-26 |author=World Energy Council |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204051628/http://www.worldenergy.org/publications/809.asp |archivedate=2008-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the emissions, almost 97%, came from direct burning of fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Transportation &amp; Climate Change: Transportation's Role in Climate Change: Overview - DOT Transportation and Climate Change Clearinghouse|url = http://climate.dot.gov/about/transportations-role/overview.html|website = climate.dot.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenhouse gas emissions from transport are increasing at a faster rate than any other energy using sector.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter5.pdf|format=PDF|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Mitigation of Climate Change, chapter 5, Transport and its Infrastructure |publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]|accessdate=2009-05-26 |author=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Road transport is also a major contributor to local air pollution and [[smog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Traditional [[transport planning]] aims to improve mobility, especially for vehicles, and may fail to adequately consider wider impacts. But the real purpose of transport is access – to work, education, goods and services, friends and family – and there are proven techniques to improve access while simultaneously reducing environmental and social impacts, and managing traffic congestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Definition==
The term '''sustainable transport''' came into use as a logical follow-on from [[sustainable development]], and is used to describe modes of transport, and systems of transport planning, which are consistent with wider concerns of [[sustainability]]. There are many definitions of the sustainable transport, and of the related terms '''sustainable transportation''' and '''sustainable mobility'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher = Victoria Transport Policy Institute
| accessdate = 2009-04-07
| work = Online TDM Encyclopedia
}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such definition, from the [[European Union]] Council of Ministers of Transport, defines a sustainable transportation system as one that:
* Allows the basic access and development needs of individuals, companies and society to be met safely and in a manner consistent with human and [[ecosystem health]], and promotes equity within and between successive generations.
* Is affordable, operates fairly and efficiently, offers a choice of [[mode of transport|transport mode]], and supports a [[competition (economics)|competitive economy]], as well as balanced regional development.
* Limits emissions and waste within the planet’s ability to absorb them, uses [[renewable resource|renewable resources]] at or below their rates of generation, and uses non-renewable resources at or below the rates of development of renewable substitutes, while minimizing the impact on the [[land use|use of land]] and the generation of [[noise pollution|noise]].

Sustainability extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions. A [[life-cycle assessment]] involves production, use and post-use considerations. A [[cradle-to-cradle design]] is more important than a focus on a single factor such as [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

These were the only personal transport choices available to most people in Western countries prior to [[World War II]], and remain the only options for most people in the developing world. Freight was moved by human power, animal power or rail.

The post-war years brought increased wealth and a demand for much greater mobility for people and goods. The number of road vehicles in Britain increased fivefold between 1950 and 1979,&lt;ref name="dft.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/tsgb/2008edition/sectionninevehicles.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090103071447/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/tsgb/2008edition/sectionninevehicles.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-01-03 |title=Transport Statistics Great Britain 2008: Section 9, Vehicles |accessdate=2009-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with similar trends in other Western nations. Most affluent countries and cities invested heavily in bigger and better-designed roads and motorways, which were considered essential to underpin growth and prosperity. Transport planning became a branch of [[Urban Planning]] and identified [[induced demand]] as a pivotal change from "predict and provide" toward a sustainable approach incorporating [[land use planning]] and [[public transit]]. Public investment in transit, walking and [[cycling]] declined dramatically in the United States, Great Britain and Australia, although this did not occur to the same extent in Canada or mainland Europe.&lt;ref name="TRB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/sr/sr257.pdf|format=PDF|title=Making Transit Work: insight from Western Europe, Canada and the United States|accessdate=2008-07-22 |website= |publisher=Transportation Research Board |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vtpi.org/AJPHpucher.pdf |format=PDF|title=Promoting Safe Walking and Cycling to Improve Public Health:Lessons from The Netherlands and Germany|accessdate=2008-08-30 |publisher=American Journal of Public Health, Vol. 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about the sustainability of this approach became widespread during the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the [[1979 energy crisis]]. The high cost and limited availability of fuel led to a resurgence of interest in alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel.

Transport innovations dating from this period include [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s, citywide [[carpool]] systems and [[transportation demand management]]. [[Singapore]] implemented [[congestion pricing]] in the late 1970s, and [[Curitiba]] began implementing its [[Rede Integrada de Transporte|Bus Rapid Transit]] system in the early 1980s.

Relatively low and stable oil prices during the 1980s and 1990s led to significant increases in vehicle travel from 1980–2000, both directly because people chose to travel by car more often and for greater distances, and indirectly because cities developed tracts of suburban housing, distant from shops and from workplaces, now referred to as [[urban sprawl]]. Trends in freight logistics, including a movement from rail and coastal shipping to road freight and a requirement for [[Just-in-time (business)|just in time]] deliveries, meant that freight traffic grew faster than general vehicle traffic.

At the same time, the academic foundations of the "predict and provide" approach to transport were being questioned, notably by [[Peter Newman (environmental scientist)|Peter Newman]] in a set of comparative studies of cities and their transport systems dating from the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook, Newman P and Kenworthy J, Gower, Aldershot, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

}}  &lt;/ref&gt; marked a change in direction for transport planning in the UK. In the introduction to the White Paper, Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] stated that&lt;blockquote&gt;
We recognise that we cannot simply build our way out of the problems we face. It would be environmentally irresponsible – and would not work.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A companion document to the White Paper called "Smarter Choices" researched the potential to scale up the small and scattered sustainable transport initiatives then occurring across Britain, and concluded that the comprehensive application of these techniques could reduce peak period car travel in urban areas by over 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/smarterchoices/ctwwt/chapter1introduction |title=Smarter Choices, Changing the Way we Travel page v |accessdate=2008-07-27 |author=Cairns, S |date=July 2004 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614001006/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/smarterchoices/ctwwt/chapter1introduction |archivedate=June 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transport systems are major emitters of greenhouse gases, responsible for 23% of world energy-related GHG emissions in 2004, with about three quarters coming from road vehicles. Currently 95% of transport energy comes from petroleum.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; Energy is consumed in the manufacture as well as the use of vehicles, and is [[Embodied energy|embodied]] in transport infrastructure including roads, bridges and railways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/16338568/3Dmapping-optimization-of-embodied-energy-of-transportation- |title=3D-Mapping Optimization of Embodied Energy of Transportation |accessdate=1 March 2018 |author=Joshua M.

The first historical attempts of evaluating the Life Cycle environmental impact of vehicle is due to [[Theodore Von Karman]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabrielli G, and von Karman Th, “What price speed?,” Mechanical Engineering, Vol 72, pp. 775-781, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; After decades in which all the analysis has been focused on emending the Von Karman model, Dewulf and Van Langenhove have introduced an model based on the second law of thermodynamics and exergy analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Dewulf J, and Van Langenhove H., “Exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) for the assessment of resource productivity of transport commodities”.

In practice there is a sliding scale of '''green transport''' depending on the sustainability of the option. Green vehicles are more [[fuel-efficient]], but only in comparison with standard vehicles, and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes. Well-patronised [[public transport]] networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles, and are generally safer and use less road space than private vehicles.&lt;ref name="TRB" /&gt; Green public transport vehicles including electric trains, trams and [[electric bus]]es combine the advantages of green vehicles with those of sustainable transport choices. Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are [[cycling]] and other [[human-powered transport|human-powered vehicles]], and [[animal powered transport]]. The most common green transport choice, with the least environmental impact is [[walking]].

Transport on rails boasts an excellent efficiency (see [[fuel efficiency in transportation]]).

Cities with overbuilt roadways have experienced unintended consequences, linked to radical drops in [[public transport]], [[walking]], and [[cycling]]. In many cases, streets became void of “life.” Stores, schools, government centers and libraries moved away from central cities, and residents who did not flee to the suburbs experienced a much reduced quality of public space and of public services. As schools were closed their mega-school replacements in outlying areas generated additional traffic; the number of cars on US roads between 7:15 and 8:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. increases 30% during the school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/kidswalk/then_and_now.htm |title=Active Transportation to School Then and Now — Barriers and Solutions |work=KidsWalk-to-School: Resource Materials - DNPAO - CDC |accessdate=2008-07-22 |author=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309081256/http://www.cdc.gov/NCCDPHP/DNPA/KIDSWALK/then_and_now.htm |archivedate=2010-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Transit-oriented development}}

Cities are shaped by their transport systems. In [[The City in History]], [[Lewis Mumford]] documented how the location and layout of cities was shaped around a walkable center, often located near a port or waterway, and with suburbs accessible by animal transport or, later, by rail or tram lines.

In 1939, the [[Futurama (New York World's Fair)|New York World's Fair]] included a model of an imagined city, built around a car-based transport system. In this "greater and better world of tomorrow", residential, commercial and industrial areas were separated, and skyscrapers loomed over a network of urban motorways. These ideas captured the popular imagination, and are credited with influencing city planning from the 1940s to the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these notes of caution, trends in car ownership,&lt;ref name="dft.gov.uk"/&gt; car use and fuel consumption continued steeply upward throughout the post-war period.

Mainstream transport planning in Europe has, by contrast, never been based on assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility. For example, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Transport Structure Scheme has since the 1970s required that demand for additional vehicle capacity only be met "if the contribution to societal welfare is positive", and since 1990 has included an explicit target to halve the rate of growth in vehicle traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rws-avv.nl/pls/portal30/docs/9860.PDF |title=National and Regional Transport Policy in the Netherlands |accessdate=2008-07-27 |author1=van den Hoorn, T |author2=B van Luipen |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724164646/http://www.rws-avv.nl/pls/portal30/docs/9860.PDF |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities outside Europe have also consistently linked transport to sustainability and to [[land-use planning]], notably [[Curitiba Master Plan|Curitiba, Brazil]], [[Portland, Oregon#Transportation|Portland, Oregon]] and [[Transportation in Vancouver|Vancouver, Canada]].

There are major differences in transport energy consumption between cities; an average U.S. urban dweller uses 24 times more energy annually for [[private transport]] than a Chinese urban resident, and almost four times as much as a European urban dweller. These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of [[walking]], [[cycling]], and [[public transport]] use and to enduring features of the city including [[urban density]] and urban design.&lt;ref name="Kenworthy"&gt;Kenworthy, J R [http://cst.uwinnipeg.ca/documents/Transport_Greenhouse.pdf Transport Energy Use and Greenhouse Emissions in Urban Passenger Transport Systems : A Study of 84 Global Cities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909205842/http://cst.uwinnipeg.ca/documents/Transport_Greenhouse.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }} Murdoch University&lt;/ref&gt;

The cities and nations that have invested most heavily in car-based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable, as measured by per capita [[fossil fuel]] use.&lt;ref name="Kenworthy" /&gt; The social and economic sustainability of car-based [[transportation engineering]] has also been questioned.

The [[European Commission]] adopted the [[Action Plan on urban mobility]] on 2009-09-30 for sustainable urban mobility. The European Commission will conduct a review of the implementation of the Action Plan in the year 2012, and will assess the need for further action. In 2007, 72% of the European population lived in urban areas, which are key to growth and employment. Cities need efficient transport systems to support their economy and the welfare of their inhabitants. Around 85% of the EU’s [[GDP]] is generated in cities. Urban areas face today the challenge of making transport sustainable in environmental ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[air pollution]], [[noise]]) and competitiveness ([[Traffic congestion|congestion]]) terms while at the same time addressing social concerns. These range from the need to respond to [[health]] problems and [[demography|demographic]] trends, fostering economic and social cohesion to taking into account the needs of [[persons with reduced mobility]], families and children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/transport/urban/urban_mobility/action_plan_en.htm Transport: Action Plan on urban mobility - European commission&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529062651/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/urban/urban_mobility/action_plan_en.htm |date=2010-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies and governance==
{{See also|urban sprawl}}

Sustainable transport policies have their greatest impact at the city level. Outside Western Europe, cities which have consistently included sustainability as a key consideration in transport and land use planning include [[Curitiba Master Plan|Curitiba, Brazil]]; [[Bogota, Colombia]]; [[Portland, Oregon#Transportation|Portland, Oregon]]; and [[Transportation in Vancouver|Vancouver, Canada]]. The [[Victoria (Australia)|state of Victoria]], [[Australia]] passed legislation in 2010 – the [[Transport Integration Act]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/LTObjSt5.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/BC2280585B69A291CA2577910008AF32/$FILE/10-6a010.pdf Transport Integration Act 2010&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; – to compel its transport agencies to actively consider sustainability issues including climate change impacts in transport policy, planning and operations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport Integration Act 2010]], Part 2 - see http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other cities throughout the world have recognised the need to link sustainability and transport policies, for example by joining Cities for Climate Protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Community and grassroots action===
Sustainable transport is fundamentally a grassroots movement, albeit one which is now recognised as of citywide, national and international significance.

Whereas it started as a movement driven by environmental concerns, over these last years there has been increased emphasis on social equity and fairness issues, and in particular the need to ensure proper access and services for lower income groups and people with mobility limitations, including the fast-growing population of older citizens. Many of the people exposed to the most vehicle noise, pollution and safety risk have been those who do not own, or cannot drive cars, and those for whom the cost of car ownership causes a severe financial burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/social_exclusion_task_force/~/media/assets/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/social_exclusion_task_force/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003%20pdf.ashx |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080521223432/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/social_exclusion_task_force/%7E/media/assets/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/social_exclusion_task_force/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003%20pdf.ashx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-21 |title=Making the Connections: Final report on transport and social exclusion |accessdate=2008-07-22 |website= |publisher=UK Social Exclusion Unit |date=February 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization called [[Greenxc]] started in 2011 created a national awareness campaign in the United States encouraging people to [[carpool]] by ride-sharing cross country stopping over at various destinations along the way and documenting their travel through video footage, posts and photography.&lt;ref name="GreenXC Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=GreenXC|url=http://www.greenxc.com|work=GreenXC Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ride-sharing reduces individual's carbon footprint by allowing several people to use one car instead of everyone using individual cars.

==Recent trends==
Car travel increased steadily throughout the twentieth century, but trends since 2000 have been more complex. [[2000s energy crisis|Oil price rises from 2003]] have been linked to a decline in per capita fuel use for private vehicle travel in the USA,&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Britain and Australia. In 2008, global oil consumption fell by 0.8% overall, with significant declines in consumption in North America, Western Europe, and parts of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| year = 2009
| publisher = [[BP]]
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Other factors affecting a decline in driving, at least in America, include the retirement of [[Baby Boomer]]s who now drive less, preference for other travel modes (such as transit) by younger age cohorts, the [[Great Recession]], and the rising use of technology (internet, mobile devices) which have made travel less necessary and possibly less attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Direction|url=http://www.uspirg.org/resources/usp/new-direction-driving-trends|work=2013|publisher=U.S. PIRG|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greenwashing==
The term ''green transport'' is often used as a [[greenwash]] marketing technique for products which are not proven to make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability. Such claims can be legally challenged. For instance Norway's [[Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman|consumer ombudsman]] has targeted [[automaker]]s who claim that their cars are "green", "clean" or "[[environmentally friendly]]". Manufacturers risk fines if they fail to drop the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL0671323420070906 |title=Norways Says Cars Neither Green Nor Clean |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) describes ''green'' claims on products as ''very vague'', ''inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim, which risks misleading them''.&lt;ref name="ACCC TPA"&gt;[http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=815763&amp;nodeId=69646a6d15e7958a41b40ab5848c6968&amp;fn=Green%20marketing%20and%20the%20Trade%20Prac ACCC: Green marketing and the Trade Practices Act, 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212080930/http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=815763&amp;nodeId=69646a6d15e7958a41b40ab5848c6968&amp;fn=Green%20marketing%20and%20the%20Trade%20Prac |date=2010-12-12 }}. Retrieved 2009-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the ACCC forced a car retailer to stop its ''green'' marketing of Saab cars, which was found by the Australian Federal Court as ''misleading''.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/MiniSite/MiniSiteArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=57188&amp;vf=28&amp;MiniSiteID=197 Drive.com.au: Coming clean on green] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222040722/http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/MiniSite/MiniSiteArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=57188&amp;vf=28&amp;MiniSiteID=197 |date=2012-02-22 }}.

The [[France|French]] '''''airborne nuclear warheads (TN81)''''' is a [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear warhead]] carried by the [[Air-Sol Moyenne Portée (ASMP)]] medium-range [[air-to-surface missile]], a component of the [[Force de frappe]] French nuclear deterrent. The warhead was introduced in 1988. By 1991, 80 warheads had been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Norris|first1=Robert S.|last2=Arkin|first2=William M.|last3=Kristensen

Deployment: 60 warheads carried by the ASMP equipping the 60 [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D|Mirage 2000 N]] with the French Air Force and 20 [[Super Etendard]] of Naval Aviation. Each TN81 has a declared destructive power of 300 kilotonnes. This amounts to over 20 times the power of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 and caused some 250 000 deaths then or in the aftermath.

It has been replaced by 54 [[TNA (Airborne nuclear warhead)]] [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear warhead]] carried by the ASMPA equipping the [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D|Mirage 2000 N]] and [[Dassault Rafale]].&lt;ref name="champagne"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|url=http://www.acdn.net/spip/IMG/article_PDF/Latest-Vintage-from-Champagne-New_a636.pdf|title=Latest Vintage from Champagne: New Rafale jets now carrying new ASMP-A missiles and new TNA nuclear warheads!|work= |date=1 July 2001|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8625">'''TigerSwan''' is an [[international security]] and global stability firm founded in 2008 by retired [[U.S. Army]] [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and [[Delta Force]] operator James Reese.

==Background==
TigerSwan is a [[Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business]] based in [[Apex, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TigerSwan Awarded US Dept of Defense Iraq Security Contract|url=http://www.tigerswan.com/tigerswan-awarded-us-dept-of-defense-iraq-security-contract/|website=TigerSwan|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company operates globally.&lt;ref name=star/&gt; Founder James Reese served in the elite [[Delta Force]] unit. He started his career as an [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] cadet and served in the [[United States Army]] for 25 years. Reese was an adviser, commander and operations officer during the invasions of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|title=Delta Force veteran to speak at MU commencement|url=http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/local/2015/04/15/mansfield-commencement-speaker-reese-delta/25834423/|accessdate=15 May 2017|agency=Star Gazette|publisher=USA Today|date=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has over 300 employees and conducts operations in over 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tigerswan.com/blog/jim-reese-fox-friends-approach-to-syria/|title=Jim Reese Joins Fox and Friends to Discuss Syria {{!}} TigerSwan|website=www.tigerswan.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TigerSwan firearms training center was located near Cedar Creek in [[Cumberland County, North Carolina]]. Since it opened in 2010, the range has offered firearms and tactical training to military, law enforcement and the public. In 2014, Reese sold the training company, and the shooting range changed its name to the Range Complex.&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Gregory|title=TigerSwan firearms training center has new owners and name|url=http://www.fayobserver.com/article/20140514/News/305149623|accessdate=15 May 2017|agency=The Fayetteville Observer|date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Kill Bin Laden'' [[Battle of Tora Bora#Fury.27s account|Dalton Fury]] wrote: "Delta Force legends like Paul Howe of Combat Shooting and Tactics Inc., Larry Vickers of Vickers Tactical Inc., and Brian Searcy of Tiger Swan Inc., and Kyle Lamb of Viking Tactics Inc., can't only teach you how to shoot a gnat off a bull's ass at fifty yards while on the move but they will actually show you how it's done first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fury|first1=Dalton|title=Kill Bin Laden|date=2008|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCQvFOqA04sC|isbn=9781429960762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
===Iraq War===
The firm provided security for the Iraqi Mine-Unexploded Ordnance Clearing Organization, a [[U.S. State Department]] funded NGO tasked with clearing munitions and mines in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TigerSwan Escorts Medical Provider to Baghdad on Journey of Compassion|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130318006525/en/TigerSwan-Escorts-Medical-Provider-Baghdad-Journey-Compassion|website=Business Wire|publisher=Berkshire Hathaway|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 Sochi Olympics===
During the [[2014 Sochi Olympics]], TigerSwan provided security for members of [[Olympic committee]]s, corporate sponsors and sports fans traveling to Sochi. They said they could pinpoint a client's location within a 3 foot radius using a [[GPS]] device provided to their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whiteside|first1=Kelly|title=Tight security at Sochi Olympics gives sense of comfort|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/sochi/2014/02/03/sochi-winter-olympics-2014-security-threats-military-police-black-widow/5193141/|accessdate=15 May 2017|agency=USA Today|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standing Rock Protests===
TigerSwan was hired by [[Dakota Access, LLC]] to provide security consulting during the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests]].&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=May|first1=Charlie|title=A reporter's notebook:The journey to Oceti Sakowin, the protest camp of the Standing Rock Sioux|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/12/25/a-reporters-notebook-the-journey-to-oceti-sakowin-the-protest-camp-of-the-standing-rock-sioux/|accessdate=15 May 2017|agency=salon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal company documents, which were leaked to ''[[The Intercept]]'', reportedly compared the movement opposed to the pipeline with [[jihadis]], calling them "an ideologically driven insurgency with a strong religious component."&lt;ref name=intercept&gt;{{Cite news| last = Brown| first = Alleen| title = Leaked Documents Reveal Counterterrorism Tactics Used at Standing Rock to "Defeat Pipeline Insurgencies"| work = The Intercept| accessdate = 2017-05-30| url = https://theintercept.com/2017/05/27/leaked-documents-reveal-security-firms-counterterrorism-tactics-at-standing-rock-to-defeat-pipeline-insurgencies/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Intercept'' called the DAPL operation a "multi-faceted private security operation characterized by sweeping and invasive surveillance of protesters," and reported that the leaked situation and disinformation reports prepared by the company during the protest provide evidence of [[aerial surveillance]], as well as radio eavesdropping.&lt;ref name=intercept/&gt;

The owner of the Dakota Access Pipeline hired over a half dozen security companies to work with law enforcement officials to protect the pipeline against [[vandalism]], [[arson]], and other acts of [[eco-terrorism]]. "As TigerSwan security employees began to arrive in at the Standing Rock protest site, protesters began showing up in the camps calling for violence and engaging in increasingly menacing rhetoric. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]], and [[Bureau of Land Management]] all participated in the security operation."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://americansecuritynews.com/stories/511412336-eco-terrorism-prompted-dakota-access-pipeline-to-hire-security-firms-to-assist-law-enforcement-at-standing-rock-protest-site|title=Eco-terrorism prompted Dakota Access Pipeline to hire security firms to assist law enforcement at Standing Rock protest site|last=|first=|date=2017-03-24|work=American Security News|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pipeline needed extra security due to arson and other acts of destruction. For example, on July 24, 2017, activists Jessica Reznicek and Ruby Montoya admitted that they were responsible for setting fires to the pipeline and destroying valves. The two referred to their actions as "peaceful." The two women cut through the pipeline with a torch, but at one point torched a hole through a part of the pipeline that had oil in it, which caused oil to spill.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legal==
In 2013 TigerSwan filed a lawsuit against the United States in Federal Court alleging breach of contract due to improper termination. The dispute was over two contracts that were awarded by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for Iraq-based security services. The DoD initially awarded the contracts to TigerSwan, but then terminated the contracts and awarded them instead to the British [[private military company]] [[Aegis Defence Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TigerSwan's Suit Over Iraq Security Contract Kept Alive|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/429769/tigerswan-s-suit-over-iraq-security-contract-kept-alive|website=Law360|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court denied the government's request to dismiss the case, finding that a contractor does not always need to show [[specific intent]] in order to prevail on a claim that alleges [[Bad faith#In law|bad-faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contract Termination Suits Not A Lost Cause, But Still Tough|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/432852/contract-termination-suits-not-a-lost-cause-but-still-tough|website=Law360|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roin|first1=Julie A.|title=Public-Private Partnerships and Termination for Convenience Clauses: Time for a Mandate|journal=Emory Law Journal|date=2013|volume=63|issue=2|url=http://law.emory.edu/elj/content/volume-63/issue-2/articles/public-private-partnerships.html|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="944">'''Transaction payments as a service''' ('''TPaaS''') is a phrase used to describe a [[Software as a service|SaaS]]-based methodology which allows platforms to become their own merchant platforms and provide merchant services directly. This is distinct from [[payments as a service]] which aggregates multiple payment technologies into one platform.&lt;ref name=twnow&gt;[http://twnow.com/transaction-payments-as-a-service/ Transaction Payments As A Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

==TPaaS layer==
The TPaaS layer allows organisations to become their own merchant provider, this facilitates functionality that is normally only available to merchant aggregators such as commission splits, merchant of record and instant onboarding.&lt;ref name=twnow/&gt;

[[File:Tutte l'opere d'architettura MET DP109531.jpg|thumb|A page from the seventh book]]

'''''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva''''' (''All the Works of Architecture and Perspective'') is an [[architecture|architectural]] [[treatise]] by [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] architect [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475-1554). Serlio is sometimes regarded as one of the most important. The treatise is composed of eight [[book]]s, the sixth of which was lost for some centuries and the eighth of which was not published until relatively recently. The eighth book is not always considered to be part of the treatise. The first five books cover Serlio's works on [[geometry]], [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] antiquity, the [[Classical order|Orders]] and [[Church (building)|church]] design. The sixth illustrates domestic designs ranging from [[peasant]] huts to royal palaces, providing a unique record of Renaissance house types, including up-to-date [[fortress]]es for [[tyrant]]s and mercenaries as well as Serlio's unbuilt design for the [[Louvre]]. The seventh book illustrates a range of common design problems ignored by past theorists, including how to remodel, or 'restore', [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[façade]]s following antique principles of [[symmetry]] and [[Proportion (architecture)|proportion]]. The eighth book, called "'''Castrametation of the Romans'''", reconstructs a Roman encampment after the description by [[Polybius]], followed by a military [[city]] and monumental [[bridge]] supposedly built by the Emperor [[Trajan]]. With its [[Forum (Roman)|forum]], [[consul]]'s palace and [[Roman baths|baths]], the book is part-fantasy and part-[[archaeology]], quite unlike Serlio's other more practical works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1850">The '''West Melbourne Gasworks''' was a [[coal gasification]] plant in [[West Melbourne, Victoria|West Melbourne]], Victoria, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;''Circle of Influence – A History of the Gas Industry in Victoria'' Ray Proudley 1987, Hargreen Publishing Company in Association with the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Melbourne was settled in 1835, and by the early 1850s the gold-rushes had led to rapid population growth. The City of Melbourne Gas and Coke Company leased five acres (2 hectares) of Crown Land in 1854, to construct a plant for the gasification of black coal. The works operated until 1962, importing coal via a dedicated wharf and a system of narrow gauge tracks drawn by steam locomotives.&lt;ref&gt;''Light Railways'' No.136 April 1997, Light Railways Research Society of Australia&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these locomotives have been preserved and are now used on the [[Puffing Billy Railway]]. 

In 1962, the works was upgraded to incorporate a catalytic oil gas facility, but this was shiort-lived, and in 1970 the works was closed down, and the remaining structures demolished by 1974.&lt;ref name=Dames&amp;Moore&gt;[https://apps.epa.vic.gov.au/EnvAuditFiles/53X/36567-1/36567-1_a.pdf Dames &amp; Moore, 'Report, Environmental Audit Area A West Melbourne Gasworks Site,' 2002, Docklands Authority]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site extent==

The works was gradually expanded between 1900 and 1910, eventually covering 8 hectares in an area now extending from Waterview Walk to the Yarra River, with the new Collins Street extension and Harbour Esplanade running through the site.
