      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4561">An '''accelerograph''' can be referred to as a strong-motion instrument or [[seismograph]], or simply an [[earthquake]] [[accelerometer]].  They are usually constructed as a self-contained box, which previously included a paper or film recorder&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reading and Interpreting Strong Motion Accelerograms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88hRAAAAMAAJ|last=Hudson|first=D.E.|publisher=Earthquake Engineering Research Institute|year=1979|isbn=0685143880}}&lt;/ref&gt; (an analogue instrument) but now they often record directly on digital media and then the data is transmitted via the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/stnsdata/cnsn/sm/IA_Details_e.php Technical Details on the GSC's Internet Accelerograph]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accelerographs are useful for when the earthquake ground motion is so strong that it causes the more sensitive [[seismometers]] to go off-scale.  There is an entire science of [[strong ground motion]], that is dedicated to studying the shaking in the vicinity of earthquakes (roughly within about 100&amp;nbsp;km of the fault rupture).

Accelerographs record the acceleration of the ground with respect to time. This recording is often called an accelerograms, strong-motion record or acceleration time-history. From this record strong-motion intensity measures (IMs, also called parameters) can be computed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Douglas|first=John|last2=Seyedi|first2=Darius M.|last3=Ulrich|first3=Thomas|last4=Modaressi|first4=Hormoz|last5=Foerster|first5=Evelyne|last6=Pitilakis|first6=Kyriazis|last7=Pitilakis|first7=Dimitris|last8=Karatzetzou|first8=Anna|last9=Gazetas|first9=George|date=2015-01-01|title=Evaluation of seismic hazard for the assessment of historical elements at risk: description of input and selection of intensity measures|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10518-014-9606-0|journal=[[Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering]]|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=49–65|doi=10.1007/s10518-014-9606-0|issn=1570-761X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest of which is [[peak ground acceleration]] (PGA). Other IMs include [[Arias Intensity|Arias intensity]], peak ground velocity (PGV), for which the accelerogram needs to be integrated once, peak ground  displacement (PGD), for which double integration is required. Often a [[response spectrum]] is computed to show how the earthquake would affect structures of different [[natural frequencies]] or periods. These observations are useful to assess the [[seismic hazard]] of an area.

As well as their engineering applications, accelerograms are also useful for the study earthquakes from a scientific viewpoint. For example, accelerograms can be used to reconstruct the detailed history of rupture along a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] during an earthquake, which would not be possible with seismograms from standard instruments because they would be too far away to resolve the details. An example of an accelerograph array that was established to improve knowledge of near-source earthquake shaking as well as earthquake rupture propagation is the Parkfield Experiment, which involved a massive set of strong motion instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/research/parkfield/ USGS: The Parkfield, California, Earthquake Experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the accelerograph, there is an arrangement of three [[accelerometer]] sensing heads.  In recent low-cost instruments these are usually micro-machined ([[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]) chips that are sensitive to one direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sensorland.com/HowPage023.html MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems) Technology Sensorland.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus constructed, the accelerometer can measure full motion of the device in three dimensions.

Unlike the continually recording seismometer, accelerometers nearly always work in a triggered mode.  That means a level of acceleration must be set which starts the recording process. For analogue and older digital instruments this makes maintenance much more difficult without a direct Internet connection (or some other means of communication). Many trips have been made to accelerometers after a large earthquake, only to find that the memory was filled with extraneous noise, or the instrument was malfunctioning.

Accelerometers are used to monitor the response of structures to earthquakes. Analysis of these records along with the shaking recorded at base of the structure can improve building design, through [[earthquake engineering]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12035">'''Applied Food Technologies''', Inc. ('''AFT''') is a privately held corporation in [[Alachua, Florida]] that develops diagnostics needed in the seafood industry and runs fee-for-service species identification and verification programs.  The DNA-based species identification diagnostics developed by AFT are used in-house and are also packaged in a kit format and sold to federal, state and private laboratories in the US, Europe and Asia.  AFT has established an extensive library of taxonomically verified fish species and has developed DNA standards for these fish.

Applied Food Technologies is primarily a research and development company focusing on fish species identification using DNA and environmental contaminant detection using gene expression in sentinel organisms.  AFT also offers a fee-for-service business for seafood species identification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appliedfoodtechnologies.com www.appliedfoodtechnologies.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied Food Technologies was showcased on a national broadcast of ''[[The Early Show]]'' on CBS on June 8, 2011 to discuss seafood mislabeling&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/08/earlyshow/living/money/main20070050.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; after release of a national publication on the issue by consumer advocate group [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]] and a subsequent ''New York Times'' publication&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/science/earth/27fish.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject.  Although in business for several years, Applied Food Technologies came to the national attention after becoming the first company with DNA-based fish species identification methods recognized by the FDA to test all catfish imported from China in the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Broiled, blackened, fried - DNA-tested?, STEPHEN NOHLGREN, ''St. Petersburg Times'', February 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Applied Food Technologies was subsequently interviewed in May, 2010, by ABC affiliate WCJB-TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcjb.com/news/6883/technology-spotlight-5-18-10-applied-food-technologies WCJB News Spotlight]&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Food Technologies was showcased in University of Florida’s ''Explore'' magazine Fall 2011, issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ufl.edu/explore/current/story_2/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703072522/http://www.research.ufl.edu/explore/current/story_2/index.html |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

AFT has been criticized as being "in industry's pocket" because AFT has been a loud voice in support of industry against media reports of mislabeling.  AFT claims their internal testing has shown a much lower mislabeling rate than media reports.  Although Applied Food Technologies has been included in numerous media reports concerning seafood species mislabeling and has been contacted to conduct testing for the media many times, AFT does not perform species identification testing for the media, which may be the cause of some criticism.  AFT's mission statement includes offering a testing service to the seafood industry utilizing the "best available science" for the purpose of improving the industry to better serve the consumer.  Typically the media outlets are unable to meet the chain of custody requirements within the "best available science" component, which is one of the principal reasons AFT does not offer testing to the media.

Applied Food Technologies offers fee-for-service business in several areas including fish species identification (also known as Fish ID), seafood net weight, and antibiotic residue testing, which are described in detail below.

==Seafood mislabelling==
{{main|Seafood mislabelling}}

==Purpose ==

Even with the plethora of laws and regulations protecting consumers from mislabeling of seafood, enforcing compliance has been challenging because of the unique nature of seafood itself.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/science/earth/27fish.html?_r=2&amp;src=tptw&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike cattle, poultry, pork, crops, or other land-based food sources, the "farms" on which wild seafood is grown cannot easily be inspected.  LeeAnn Applewhite realized in 2000 that modern technology could be used to solve this problem, was awarded several USDA SBIR research awards to develop the tools, and founded AFT to create a solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appliedfoodtechnologies.com www.appliedfoodtechnologies.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied Food Technologies maintains an internal DNA database generated from a collection of economically important seafood specimens, which were taxonomically identified by third-party institutions, such as the [[Smithsonian]] and the Florida Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appliedfoodtechnologies.com www.appliedfoodtechnologies.com] (Last visited October 1, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  These taxonomically validated specimens were sequenced in multiple regions to create a database of unique sequences capable of correctly identifying and distinguishing different seafood species."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appliedfoodtechnologies.com www.appliedfoodtechnologies.com] (Last visited October 1, 2011.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Because only species identification testing that compares the sequence to a validated reference meets the current FDA guidelines for species identification, any lab not using a validated reference does not meet the FDA requirement.&lt;ref&gt;The GAO reports that the FDA, NOAA, and others require a taxonomically validated reference sample, which is not possible in a public database where additions to the database are not moderated.  http://www.gao.gov/htext/d09258.html&lt;/ref&gt;  AFT's Applewhite says, "Using a public database to determine a fish species is not very useful because the data is only as accurate as the least careful person submitting sequences, thus, the DNA sequences for common substitutes can also appear in the database under the wrong name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ufl.edu/explore/current/story_2/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703072522/http://www.research.ufl.edu/explore/current/story_2/index.html |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  FDA’s Stephanie Yao agrees, "Most other labs are pulling publicly available sequences off of the Internet to make their identifications, a practice FDA does not recommend for regulatory decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ufl.edu/explore/current/story_2/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703072522/http://www.research.ufl.edu/explore/current/story_2/index.html |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  FDA's Yao continued, AFT "often runs samples for importers whose shipments are being held by the FDA and the FDA has released some of those shipments based on AFT’s results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ufl.edu/explore/current/story_2/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703072522/http://www.research.ufl.edu/explore/current/story_2/index.html |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Applied Food Technologies CEO, LeeAnn Applewhite, incorporated APL Sciences in 1997 after inventing a seafood test kit and licensing the technology to Neogen Corporation.  APL Sciences received five USDA [[Small Business Innovation Research]] (SBIR) Awards totaling approximately $1,000,000.00.  AFT was formed in 2003 in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]], by LeeAnn Applewhite and Maureen Dolan to be the fee-for-service testing laboratory and manufacturing and marketing arms for APL Science, Inc.  AFT has also been awarded several SBIR grants and industry research contracts including most recently a grant to develop a method for species identification for the U.S. shrimp industry.

=== Milestones ===

*2000 – Started development of DNA-based diagnostics for seafood species identification through USDA SBIR research grant targeted toward the growing national issue of seafood mislabeling.
:: Collaborated with the Seafood Industry to collect fish and shellfish species for taxonomical verification at museums across the country to establish a validated database of reference specimens.
*2002 – Developed and launched the PCR multiplex Authenti-kit(SM) for Crab diagnostic kit for crab species identification.
*2004 – Developed and launched the PCR multiplex Authenti-kit(SM) for Catfish diagnostic kit for catfish species identification.
*2005 – Began partnering with US Foods after US Foods approached AFT to start a grouper authentication program, following recommendation by NOAA NMFS.
::– Worked with US Foods, FDA, and other Seafood Industry stakeholders to develop an acceptable sampling plan for species identification testing.
::- AFT began using protein fingerprinting techniques to perform species identification on a larger number of species.
*2006 – Collaborated extensively with FDA to create regulatory standards and protocols currently recommended for molecular regulatory compliance testing for species identification.
::– Authenti-kit(SM) for Catfish becomes the first DNA method accepted for regulatory compliance testing by FDA after FDA approves Authenti-kit(SM) for Catfish for use in regulatory compliance testing under Import Alert 16-128.
*2007 – AFT’s regulatory testing program expanded to collaborations with multiple state agencies to create state standards and testing programs for species identification testing using Authenti-kit(SM) for Catfish.
::– Collaborated with FDA to develop the extraction protocol for DNA-barcoding for fish species identification which later became FDA [http://www.fda.gov/food/scienceresearch/laboratorymethods/ucm169034.htm LIB-4420].
::– Greatly expanded industry and regulatory testing programs using DNA-barcoding for most fish species outside the Authenti-kit(SM) product line.
::- AFT began to use DNA techniques exclusively to identify seafood species.
*2008 – Teamed with FDA to develop the requirements for private laboratory data reports (ORA Laboratory Manual, Section 7) for DNA-barcoding for Import Alert 16-128.
::– Began analyzing DNA sequence discrepancies in commonly used databases, such as Genbank and Fish Barcode of Life, to develop definitive secondary tests to differentiate between
::closely related species of commercially important seafood that cannot be distinguished using data from the public databases alone.
*2009 – Initiated substantial research and development program to create DNA mini-barcoding and real-time PCR methods to discriminate closely related species, allowing AFT to distinguish between 
::closely related species that are indistinguishable using current DNA-barcoding or public database-related protocols.
*2010 - AFT moved operations from Virginia to Alachua, Florida and reincorporated in Florida. 
*2011 - AFT purchased the assets of [http://www.ecoarray.com EcoArray], Inc., bringing AFT into the environmental arena.  AFT currently resides in the [[Sid Martin Biotechnology Incubator]].

Today, AFT focuses on research and development work, which constitutes a majority of AFT revenues.  AFT offers contract research services in its product portfolio.  After the acquisition of EcoArray assets, AFT entered into the environmental water testing market.  EcoArray’s core proprietary technology offers a comparison of fish gene expression with and without a certain environmental toxin to determine if the toxin is present in the water.  AFT is also branching out into species identification testing in a number of new areas.&lt;ref&gt;Information gathered from [http://www.appliedfoodtechnologies.com Applied Food Technologies] website.

'''Betamax''' (also called '''Beta''', as in its logo) is a consumer-level analog-recording and [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|cassette]] format of [[magnetic tape]] for [[video]].  It was developed by [[Sony]] and was released in [[Japan]] on May 10, 1975.&lt;ref name="McDonald2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=McDonald|first=Paul|title=Video and DVD Industries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G68TAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 June 2012|date=2007-08-06|publisher=British Film Institute|isbn=9781844571673|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Betamax device introduced in the United States was the LV-1901 console, which included a {{convert|19|in|cm|adj=on}} color monitor, and appeared in stores in early November 1975.

Production of Betamax recorders ceased in 2002; new Betamax cassettes were available until March 2016, when Sony stopped making and selling them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beta Video Cassette and Micro MV Cassette Tape End of Shipment Announcement|url=http://www.sony.co.jp/SonyInfo/News/Press/201511/15-1110/index.html|website=Sony Japan|publisher=Sony|accessdate=10 November 2015|date=10 November 2015|quote="In March 2016, Sony will end shipment of the Beta video cassette and micro cassette MV."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the rival videotape format VHS (introduced in Japan by JVC in October 1976&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totalrewind.org/vhs/H_3300.htm] JVC HR-3300 release.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States by RCA in August 1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagic.com/history/vbt200.html |title=CED in the History of Media Technology |publisher=Cedmagic.com |date=1977-08-23 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betamax has no [[Guard band#Recording|guard band]] and uses [[azimuth recording]] to reduce [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]]. According to Sony's history webpages, the name had a double meaning: ''beta'' is the Japanese word used to describe the way in which signals are recorded on the tape; and the shape of the lowercase Greek letter [[Beta (letter)|beta]] (β) resembles the course of the tape through the transport. The suffix ''-max'', from the word "maximum", was added to suggest greatness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021017222845/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-13/h5.html "This is a revolution!"] Archive of Sony.net history&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1977, Sony issued the first long-play Betamax VCR, the SL-8200. This VCR had two recording speeds: normal, and the newer half speed. This provided two hours' recording on
the L-500 Beta videocassette. The SL-8200 was to compete against the VHS VCRs, which allowed up to 4, and later 6 and 8, hours of recording on one cassette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewindmuseum.com/betamax.htm |title=1975 – The Sony SL-8200 long play VCR |publisher=Rewindmuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanyo]] marketed a version as ''Betacord'', which also was casually called "Beta". In addition to Sony and Sanyo, Beta-format video recorders were manufactured and sold by [[Toshiba]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[Murphy Radio|Murphy]], [[Aiwa]], and [[NEC Corporation|NEC]].  The [[Zenith Electronics Corporation]] and [[WEGA]] Corporations contracted with [[Sony]] to produce VCRs for their product lines.  The department stores [[Sears]] (in the United States and Canada) and [[Quelle (company)|Quelle]] (in Germany) sold Beta-format VCRs under their house brands, as did the [[RadioShack]] chain of electronic stores. Betamax and VHS competed in a fierce [[Videotape format war|format war]], which saw VHS win in most markets.&lt;ref name="owen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html |title=The Betamax vs VHS Format War| author= Dave Owen| date= 2005 |publisher=Mediacollege.com |format= video|accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home and professional recording==
One other major consequence of the Betamax technology's introduction to the U.S. was the lawsuit ''[[Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios]]'' (1984, the "Betamax case"), with the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] determining home videotaping to be legal in the United States, wherein home videotape cassette recorders were a legal technology since they had substantial noninfringing uses. This precedent was later invoked in ''[[MGM v. Grokster]]'' (2005), where the high court agreed that the same "substantial noninfringing uses" standard applies to authors and vendors of [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing software (notably excepting those who "actively induce" copyright infringement through "purposeful, culpable expression and conduct").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=betamaxcase |title= BETAMAX CASE |publisher=Museum.tv |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Paul.

For the professional and broadcast video industry, Sony derived [[Betacam]] from Betamax. Released in 1982, Betacam became the most widely used videotape format in [[Electronic News Gathering|ENG]] (electronic news gathering), replacing the {{convert|.75|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide [[U-matic]] tape format. Betacam and Betamax are similar in some ways: they use the same videocassette shape, use the same oxide tape formulation with the same [[coercivity]], and record linear audio tracks in the same location of the tape. But in the key area of video recording, Betacam and Betamax are completely different. (For details, see the [[Betacam]] article.)

Sony also offered a range of industrial Betamax products, a Beta I-only format for industrial and institutional users. These were aimed at the same market as [[U-Matic]] equipment, but were cheaper and smaller. The arrival of Betacam reduced the demand for both industrial Beta and U-Matic equipment.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3NFAbjYD8MkC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=Betamax+Betamax+is+a+color-under+system&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o2DvhcNqaN&amp;sig=ExW4ZhmE6e-3u_Ueq7pTd3_Gke8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vywrT-2ILYvKrAex9djIDA&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Betamax%20Betamax%20is%20a%20color-under%20system&amp;f=false |title=The filmmaker's handbook: a comprehensive guide for the digital age |author = Steven Ascher, Edward Pincus|page= 38 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Betamax also had a significant part to play in the music recording industry, when Sony introduced its [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] (Pulse Code Modulation) digital recording system as an encoding box/[[PCM adaptor]] that connected to a Betamax recorder. The Sony PCM-F1 adaptor was sold with a companion Betamax VCR SL-2000 as a portable [[digital audio]] recording system. Many recording engineers used this system in the 1980s and 1990s to make their first [[digital master]] recordings.

Initially, Sony was able to tout several Betamax-only features, such as BetaScan—a high speed picture search in either direction—and BetaSkipScan, a technique that allowed the operator to see where he was on the tape by pressing the FF key (or REW, if in that mode): the transport would switch into the BetaScan mode until the key was released. This feature is discussed in more detail on [[Peep Search]]. Sony believed that the M-Load transports used by VHS machines made copying these trick modes impossible. BetaSkipScan (Peep Search) is now available on miniature M-load formats, but even Sony was unable to fully replicate this on VHS. BetaScan was originally called "Videola" until the company that made the [[Moviola]] threatened legal action.

Sony would also sell a BetaPak, a small deck designed to be used with a camera. Concerned with the need for several pieces and cables to connect them, an integrated camera/recorder was designed, which Sony dubbed a "Camcorder"; the result was Betamovie. Betamovie used the standard-size cassette, but with a modified transport. The tape was wrapped 300[[Degree (angle)|°]] around a smaller, {{convert|44.671|mm|in|4|abbr=on}}-diameter head drum, with a single dual-azimuth head to write the video tracks. For playback, the tape would be inserted into a Beta-format deck. Due to the different geometry and writing techniques employed, playback within the camcorder was not feasible. SuperBeta and industrial Betamovie camcorders would also be sold by Sony.

===HiFi audio upgrade===
In June 1983, Sony introduced high fidelity audio to videotape as Beta Hi-Fi. For [[NTSC]], Beta HiFi worked by placing a pair of FM [[Carrier wave|carriers]] between the chroma (C) and luminance (Y) carriers, a process known as frequency multiplexing. Each head had a specific pair of carriers; in total, four individual channels were employed. Head A recorded its hi-fi carriers at 1.38(L) and 1.68(R) MHz, and the B head employed 1.53 and 1.83&amp;nbsp;MHz. The result was audio with an 80&amp;nbsp;dB dynamic range, with less than 0.005% [[wow (recording)|wow]] and [[flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betainfoguide.net/BetaBetter.html |title=Why Beta is Better |publisher=Betainfoguide.net |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of Beta Hi-Fi, Sony shifted the Y carrier up by 400&amp;nbsp;kHz to make room for the four FM carriers that would be needed for Beta Hi-Fi. All Beta machines incorporated this change, plus the ability to hunt for a lower frequency pre-AFM Y carrier. Sony incorporated an "antihunt" circuit, to stop the machine hunting for a Y carrier that wasn't there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palsite.com/format.html |title=Betamax the Better Format |publisher=Palsite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Sony NTSC models were marketed as "Hi-Fi Ready" (with an SL-HFR prefix to the model's number instead of the usual SL or SL-HF). These Betamax decks looked like a regular Betamax model, except for a special 28-pin connector on the rear. If the user desired a Beta Hi-Fi model but lacked the funds at the time, he could purchase an "SL-HFRxx" and at a later date purchase the separate Hi-Fi Processor. Sony offered two outboard Beta Hi-Fi processors, the HFP-100 and HFP-200. They were identical except that the HFP-200 was capable of multi-channel TV sound, with the word "stereocast" printed after the Beta Hi-Fi logo. This was possible because unlike a VHS Hi-Fi deck, an NTSC Betamax didn't need an extra pair of heads. The HFP-x00 would generate the needed carriers which would be recorded by the attached deck, and during playback the AFM carriers would be passed to the HFP-x00. They also had a small "fine tracking" control on the rear panel for difficult tapes.

For [[PAL]], however, the bandwidth between the chroma and luminance carriers was not sufficient to allow additional FM carriers, so depth multiplexing was employed, wherein the audio track would be recorded in the same way that the video track was. The lower-frequency audio track was written first by a dedicated head, and the video track recorded on top by the video head. The head disk had an extra pair of audio-only heads with a different azimuth, positioned slightly ahead of the regular video heads, for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palsite.com/slospec.html |title=Sony SLO-1700 specs |publisher=Palsite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony was confident that VHS could not achieve the same audio performance feat as Beta Hi-Fi. However, to the chagrin of Sony, JVC did develop a VHS hi-fi system on the principle of depth multiplexing approximately a year after the first Beta Hi-Fi VCR, the SL-5200, was introduced by Sony. Despite initial praise as providing "CD sound quality", both Beta Hi-Fi and VHS HiFi suffered from "carrier buzz", where high frequency information bled into the audio carriers, creating momentary "buzzing" and other audio flaws. Both systems also used [[compander|companding]] noise-reduction systems, which could create "pumping" artifacts under some conditions. Both formats also suffered from interchange problems, where tapes made on one machine did not always play back well on other machines. When this happened and if the artifacts became too distracting, users were forced to revert to the old linear soundtrack.

===New standards: SuperBetamax and Extended Definition Betamax===
In early 1985, Sony would introduce a new feature, High Band or SuperBeta, by again shifting the Y carrier—this time by 800&amp;nbsp;kHz. This improved the bandwidth available to the Y sideband and increased the horizontal resolution from 240 to 290&amp;nbsp;lines on a regular-grade Betamax cassette. Since over-the-antenna and cable signals were only 300–330 lines resolution, SuperBeta could make a nearly identical copy of live television. However, the chroma resolution still remained relatively poor, limited to just under 0.4&amp;nbsp;MHz or approximately 30&amp;nbsp;lines resolution, whereas live broadcast [[chrominance]] resolution was over 100&amp;nbsp;lines. The heads were also narrowed to 29&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|μm]] to reduce crosstalk, with a narrower head gap to play back the higher carrier frequency at 5.6&amp;nbsp;MHz. Later, some models would feature further improvement, in the form of Beta-Is, a high band version of the Beta-I recording mode. There were some incompatibilities between the older Beta decks and SuperBeta, but most could play back a high band tape without major problems. SuperBeta decks had a switch to disable the SuperBeta mode for compatibility purposes. (SuperBeta was only marginally supported outside of Sony, as many licensees had already discontinued their Betamax line.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT6UlAvKz88 |title=Sony SuperBetamax demo tape on youtube |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-09-03 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betamaxcollectors.com/sonysuperbetamaxmodelsl-hf600.html |title=Sony Super Betamax Model SL-HF600 |publisher=Betamaxcollectors.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Sony would again push the envelope with ED Beta, or "Extended Definition" Betamax, capable of up to 500 lines of resolution, that equaled DVD quality (480 typical). In order to store the ~6.5&amp;nbsp;MHz-wide luma signal, with the peak frequency at 9.3&amp;nbsp;MHz, Sony used a metal formulation tape borrowed from the Betacam SP format (branded "ED-Metal") and incorporated some improvements to the transport to reduce mechanically induced aberrations in the picture. Beta ED also featured a luminance carrier deviation of 2.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, as opposed to the 1.2&amp;nbsp;MHz used in SuperBeta, improving contrast with reduced luminance noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palsite.com/tapes.html |title=tapes Extended Definition" Betamax |publisher=Palsite.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony introduced two ED decks and a camcorder in the late 1980s. The top end EDV-9500 (EDV-9300 in Canada) deck was a very capable editing deck, rivaling much more expensive U-Matic set-ups for its accuracy and features, but did not have commercial success due to lack of timecode and other pro features. Sony did market Beta ED to "semiprofessional" users, or "[[prosumers]]". One complaint about the EDC-55 ED CAM was that it needed a lot of light (at least 25&amp;nbsp;lux), due to the use of two CCDs instead of the typical single-CCD imaging device. The Beta ED lineup only recorded in BII/BIII modes, with the ability to play back BI/BIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joeclark.org/beta/BetterBetaList.html |title=Beta by Sony list |publisher=Joeclark.org |date=2004-12-26 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the sharp decline in sales of Betamax recorders in the late 1980s and subsequent halt in production of new recorders by Sony in 2002, Betamax, SuperBetamax and EDBeta are still being used by a small number of people. Even though Sony stopped making new cassettes in 2016, new cassettes are still available for purchase at [[online shop]]s and used recorders are often found at [[flea market]]s, thrift stores or on [[Internet]] [[auction]] sites. Early format [[BetaCam]] cassettes—which are physically based on the Betamax cassette—continue to be available for use in the professional media.

The somewhat unintuitive analog resolution loss for 16:9 DVD compared to 4:3 DVD arises from the fact that analog resolution unit is "lines per picture height". When picture height is kept the same, the same 720 pixels are spread to a wider area in 16:9, hence lower horizontal resolution per picture height.

=== Tape lengths ===
Both [[Multi-standard television|NTSC and PAL/SECAM]] Betamax cassettes are physically identical (although the signals recorded on the tape are incompatible). However, as tape speeds differ between NTSC and PAL/SECAM, the playing time for any given cassette will vary accordingly between the systems. Other unusual lengths were produced from time to time, such as L-410.

* For NTSC only, BI is standard speed, BII is 1/2 speed, BIII is 1/3 speed

==Home movies==
{{Main article|Betamovie}}
Two-piece camera/VCR systems rapidly displaced [[Super 8 mm film]] as the medium of choice for shooting home movies and amateur films. These units included a portable VCR, which the videographer would carry by a shoulder strap, and a separate camera, which was connected to the VCR by a special cable. At this point, Beta had several advantages over VHS systems. The smaller Beta cassette made for smaller and lighter VCRs.

However, consumers wanted a one-piece solution. The first one-piece consumer camcorder, the Betamovie, came from Sony. A major requirement for a one-piece camcorder was miniaturizing the recording head drum, and Sony's solution to this involved a nonstandard video signal which would become standard only when played back on full-sized VCRs. A side effect of this was that Beta camcorders were record-only: consumers saw this as a major limitation.

VHS manufacturers found a better solution to drum miniaturization (it involved four heads doing the work of two). Because it used standard video signals, VHS camcorders could review footage in the camcorder and copy to another VCR for editing. This shifted the home movie advantage dramatically away from Beta, and was a primary reason for the loss of Beta market share: owners of Beta VCRs found that a VHS camcorder would allow them to copy and edit footage to their Beta deck – something that Betamovie could not do. If rental movies were not available in Beta, they could rent them in VHS and use their camcorder to play them. Owners of VHS VCRs could also choose a variant camcorder format called [[VHS-C]]. This used a miniaturized cassette to make a camcorder smaller and lighter than any Betamovie.

Sony could not duplicate the functionality of VHS-C camcorders, and seeing the rapid loss of market share, eventually introduced the [[Video8]] format. Their hope was that Video8 could replace both Beta and VHS for all uses. For more information, see the article on [[camcorders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507051842/http://www.floridahomemovies.com/wp/?page_id=185|archivedate=2017-05-07|url=http://www.floridahomemovies.com/wp/?page_id=185 |title=BetaMax history |publisher=Floridahomemovies.com|accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of production==
On November 10, 2015, Sony announced that it would no longer be producing Betamax video cassettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34776424 |title=Sony says goodbye to Betamax tapes|publisher=BBC News|date=2015-11-10|accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production and sales ended March 2016 after nearly 41 years of continuous production. Third party manufacturers continue to make new cassettes. While these cassettes are designed for use with the Betacam format, the cassettes are interchangeable with traditional Betamax systems.

{{For|reasons Betamax lost to VHS|Videotape format war}}

The VHS format's defeat of the Betamax format became a classic [[marketing]] case study. Sony's attempt to dictate an industry standard backfired when [[JVC]] made the tactical decision to forgo Sony's offer of Betamax in favor of developing its own technology. JVC felt that accepting Sony's offer would yield results similar to the [[U-Matic]] deal, with Sony dominating.&lt;ref name="howells"&gt;John Howells. "The Management of Innovation and Technology: The Shaping of Technology and Institutions of the Market Economy" [hardcopy], pg 76–81&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, JVC's VHS format controlled 60% of the North American market.&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;{{cite web

|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large [[economy of scale]] allowed VHS units to be introduced to the European market at a far lower cost than the rarer Betamax units. In the United Kingdom, Betamax held a 25% market share in 1981, but by 1986, it was down to 7.5% and continued to decline further. By 1984, 40 companies made VHS format equipment in comparison with Beta's 12. Sony finally conceded defeat in 1988 when it, too, began producing VHS recorders (early models were made by [[Hitachi]]), though it still continued to produce Betamax recorders until 2002.&lt;ref name="owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scrapheap"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sony Finally Throws the Betamax on Scrapheap|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/28/business/fi-beta28|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 28, 2002|accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, Betamax had more success and eventually evolved into Extended Definition Betamax, with 500+ lines of resolution.

The techniques of bioremediation of environmental areas as [[soil]], [[water]] and [[sediments]] contaminated by radionuclides are diverse and currently being set up as an ecological and economic alternative to traditional procedures. Physico-chemical conventional strategies are based on the extraction of waste by excavating and drilling, with a subsequent long-range transport for their final confinement. These works and transport have often unacceptable estimated [[cost of operation|costs of operation]] that could exceed a [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] [[United States dollar|dollars]] in the [[US]] and 50 [[million]] [[Pound sterling|pounds]] in the [[UK]].&lt;ref name="prakash"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3917470/pdf/mbt20006-0349.pdf|title=Bioremediation: a genuine technology to remediate radionuclides from the environment|last1=Prakash|first1=D|last2=Gabani|first2=P|last3=Chandel|first3=A.K|last4=Ronen|first4=Z|last5=Singh|first5=O.V|journal=Microbial Biotechnology|year= 2013|volume=6|issue=4|doi=10.1111/1751-7915.12059|pages=349–360|pmc=3917470|format=PDF|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|place=New York|pmid=23617701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The species involved in these processes have the ability to influence the properties of radionuclides such as [[solubility]], [[bioavailability]] and [[Motion (physics)|mobility]] to accelerate its stabilization. Its action is largely influenced by [[electron donors]] and [[electron acceptors|acceptors]], [[nutrient medium]], complexation of radioactive particles with the material and [[environmental factors]]. These are measures that can be performed on the source of contamination (''[[in situ]]'') or in controlled and limited facilities in order to follow the [[biological process]] more accurately and combine it with other systems (''[[ex situ]]'').&lt;ref name="newsome"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0009254113004907/1-s2.0-S0009254113004907-main.pdf?_tid=1e19ef28-1ed2-11e6-a426-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1463780027_d2587d314497c03d719dde123928563f|title=The biogeochemistry and bioremediation of uranium and other priority radionuclides|first1=L|last1=Newsome|last2=Morris|first2=K|last3=Lloyd|first3=J.R|year=2014|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.10.034|journal=Chemical Geology|publisher=Elsevier|volume=363|pages=164–184|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="in situ"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275329686_In_situ_and_ex_situ_bioremediation_of_radionuclide-contaminated_soils_at_nuclear_and_NORM_sites|chapter=9.

===Typology of radionuclides and polluting waste===
{{main|Radioactive waste}}
The presence of radioactive waste in the environment may cause long-term effects due to the [[Specific activity|activity]] and [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of the radionuclides, leading their impact to grow with time.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; These particles exist in various [[oxidation states]] and are found as [[oxides]], [[coprecipitation|coprecipitates]], or as [[organic chemical|organic]] or [[inorganic chemical|inorganic]] complexes, according to their origin and ways of liberation. Most commonly they are found in oxidized form, which makes them more soluble in water and thus more mobile.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt; Unlike organic contaminants, however, they cannot be destroyed and must be converted into a stable form or extracted from the environment.&lt;ref name="brookhaven"&gt;{{cite conference|url=https://www.bnl.gov/isd/documents/32628.pdf|title=Microbial Transformations of Radionuclides and Environmental Restoration Through Bioremediation|date=2006|conference=Symposium on "Emerging Trends in Separation Science and Technology"|publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]|first=A.J|last=Francis|format=PDF|place=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources of radioactivity are not exclusive of human activity. The [[natural radioactivity]] does not come from human sources: it covers up to ¾ of the total radioactivity in the world and has its origins in the interaction of terrestrial elements with high energy [[cosmic rays]] ([[cosmogenic nuclide|cosmogenic radionuclides]]) or in the existing materials on [[Earth]] since its formation ([[primordial nuclide|primordial radionuclides]]). In this regard, there are differences in the levels of radioactivity throughout the [[Earth's crust]]. [[India]] and mountains like the [[Alps]] are among the areas with the highest level of natural radioactivity due to their composition of [[rocks]] and [[sand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csn.es/radiacion-natural-y-artificial2|title=Radiación natural y artificial|format=Web|author=Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear|editor=[[Ministry of Industry (Spain)|Ministerio de Industria, Turismo y Comercio de España]]|access-date=24 February 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most frequent radionuclides in soils are naturally [[radium-226]] (&lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra), [[radon-222]] (&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn), [[thorium-232]] (&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th), [[uranium-238]] (&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U) and [[potassium-40]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K). Potassium-40 (up to 88% of total activity), [[carbon-14]] (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C), [[radium-226]], [[uranium-238]] and [[rubidium-87]] (&lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Rb) are found in [[ocean]] waters. Moreover, in [[groundwater]] abound radius radioisotopes such as radium-226 and [[radium-228]] (&lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Naturally occurring radionuclides in the marine environment: an overview of current knowledge with emphasis on the North Sea area|publisher=Norse Decom AS|year=2003|isbn=82-92538-01-1|first1=P|last1=Varskog|first2=E|last2=Stralberg|first3=A.T.S|last3=Varskog|first4=A|last4=Raaum|format=PDF|page=7|place=Kjeller|url=http://dom.cat/rzw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idaho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/natural.htm|title=Radioactivity in Nature|editor=[[Idaho State University]]|format=Web|access-date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also habitual in [[building materials]] radionuclides of uranium, thorium and potassium (the latter common to [[wood]]).&lt;ref name="idaho"/&gt;

The classification of radioactive waste established by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) distinguishes six levels according to [[equivalent dose]], [[specific activity]], [[heat]] released and [[half-life]] of the radionuclides:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1419_web.pdf|title=Classification of radioactive waste: general safety guide|issue=nº GSG-1|author=Vienna International Centre|journal=IAEA safety standards series|issn=1020-525X|isbn=9789201092090|publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]]|place=Viena|year=2009|format=PDF|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Exempt waste (EW)''': Waste that meets the criteria for exclusion from regulatory control for radiation protection purposes.
*'''Very short lived waste (VSLW)''': Waste with very short half-lives (often used for research and medical purposes) that can be stored over a limited period of up to a few years and subsequently cleared from regulatory control.
*'''Very low level waste (VLLW)''': Waste like soil and [[rubble]] (with low levels of activity concentration) that may also contain other hazardous waste.
*'''Low level waste (LLW)''': Waste that is above clearance levels and requires robust isolation and containment for periods of up to a few hundred years and is suitable for disposal in engineered near surface facilities. LLW include short lived radionuclides at higher levels of activity concentration and also long lived radionuclides, but only at relatively low levels of activity concentration.
*'''Intermediate level waste (ILW)''': Waste with long lived radionuclides that requires a greater degree of containment and isolation at greater depths.
*'''High level waste (HLW)''': Waste with large amounts of long lived radionuclides that need to be stored in deep, stable [[geological formations]] usually several hundred metres or more below the surface.

=== Ecological and human health consequences ===
[[File:Deformity of Hand due to X-ray burns.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Deformity of hand due to an [[X-ray]] burn.]]
Radioactive contamination is a potential danger for living organisms and results in external hazards, concerning radiation sources outside the body, and internal dangers, as a result of the incorporation of radionuclides inside the body (often by [[inhalation]] of particles or [[ingestion]] of [[contaminated food]]).&lt;ref name="chemistry"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WE7DeP21BhcC&amp;pg=PP16&amp;dq=biological+effects+of+radioactive+pollution&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikwtWx4JjLAhVC0hoKHWz8DZEQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=biological%20effects%20of%20radioactive%20pollution&amp;f=false|title=Environmental Chemistry|chapter=Effects of radioactive pollution|isbn=9788182830127|editor1-first=B.K|editor1-last=Sharma|publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|place=Meerut|year=2007|first1=B.K|last1=Sharma|first2=A|last2=Sharma|first3=M|last3=Sharma|format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, single doses from 0.25 [[Sievert|Sv]] produce first anomalies in the amount of [[leukocytes]].

The strip ranging between 2 and 5 Sv is considered the most serious and include [[bleeding]], [[ulcers]] and risk of [[death]]; values exceeding 5 Sv involve immediate death.&lt;ref name="chemistry"/&gt; If radiation, likewise, is received in small doses over long periods of time, the consequences can be equally severe. It is difficult to quantify the health effects for doses below 10 [[mSv]], but it has been shown that there is a direct relationship between prolonged exposure and [[cancer]] risk (although there is not a very clear dose-response relationship to establish clear limits of exposure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cancer risks attributable to low doses of ionizing radiation: Assessing what we really know|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/24/13761.full.pdf|last1=Brenner|first1=D.J|last2=Doll|first2=R|first3=D.T|last3=Goodhead|first4=E.J|last4=Hall|first5=C.E|last5=Land|journal=PNAS|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|volume=100|issue=24|pages=13761–13766|format=PDF|doi=10.1073/pnas.2235592100|issn=1091-6490|year=2003|pmid=14610281|pmc=283495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bacterial bioremediation ==
The biochemical transformation of radionuclides into stable isotopes by [[bacteria|bacterial species]] significantly differs from the metabolism of [[organic compounds]] coming from carbon sources. They are highly energetic radioactive forms which can be converted indirectly by the process of microbial [[energy transfer]].&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;

Radioisotopes can be transformed directly through changes in [[valence (chemistry)|valence state]] by acting as [[electron acceptor|acceptors]] or by acting as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] to [[enzymes]]. They can also be transformed indirectly by [[reducing agent|reducing]] and [[oxidizing agents]] produced by microorganisms that cause changes in [[pH]] or [[redox potential]]. Other processes include [[precipitation]] and complexation of [[surfactants,]] or [[chelating agents]] that bind to radioactive elements. Human intervention, on the other hand, can improve these processes through [[genetic engineering]] and [[omics]], or by injection of microorganisms or [[nutrients]] into the treatment area.&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brookhaven"/&gt;

===Bioreduction===
{{main|Biotransformation}}
According to the radioactive element and the specific site conditions, bacteria can enzymatically immobilize radionuclides directly or indirectly. Their [[redox potential]] is exploited by some microbial species to carry out reductions that alter the [[solubility]] and hence, mobility, [[bioavailability]] and [[radiotoxicity]]. This waste treatment technique called bioreduction or enzymatic biotransformation is very attractive because it can be done in mild conditions for the environment, does not produce hazardous secondary waste and has potential as a solution for waste of various kinds.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

[[File:Enzymatic reduction of radionuclides (en).png|thumb|460px|right|Depiction of direct enzymatic reduction. Microorganisms use organic compounds as [[Lactic acid|lactate]], [[acetate]] or [[formate]] as [[electron donors]] to reduce and leave radionuclides in insoluble form.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="intech"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/applied-bioremediation-active-and-passive-approaches/bioremediation-of-radiotoxic-elements-under-natural-environmental-conditions|chapter=Chapter 8: Bioremediation of Radiotoxic Elements under Natural Environmental Conditions|last1=Mtimunye|first1=P.J|last2=Chirwa|first2=E.M.N|doi=10.5772/56909|isbn=978-953-51-1200-6|format=Web|title=Applied Bioremediation - Active and Passive Approaches|year=2013|publisher=Intech|editor1-first=B.P|editor1-last=Yogesh|editor2-first=P|editor2-last=Rao}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Direct enzymatic reduction is the change of radionuclides of a higher oxidation state to a lower one made by [[facultative anaerobe|facultative]] and [[obligate anaerobe]]s. The radioisotope interact with binding sites of metabolically active cells and is used as [[terminal electron acceptor]] in the [[electron transport chain]] where compounds such as [[ethyl lactate]] act as [[electron donors]] under [[anaerobic respiration]].&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

The [[periplasm]] plays a very important role in these bioreductions. In the reduction of [[uranium]] (VI) to insoluble uranium (IV), made by ''[[Shewanella putrefaciens]]'', ''[[Desulfovibrio vulgaris]]'', ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'' and ''[[Geobacter sulfurreducens]]'', the activity of periplasmic [[cytochromes]] is required. The reduction of [[technetium]] (VII) to technetium (IV) made by ''S. putrefaciens'', ''G. sulfurreducens'', ''D. desulfuricans'', ''[[Geobacter metallireducens]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', on the other hand, requires the presence of the complex [[formate hydrogenlyase]], also placed in this cell compartment.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

Other radioactive [[actinides]] such as [[thorium]], [[plutonium]], [[neptunium]] and [[americium]] are enzymatically reduced by ''[[Rhodoferax ferrireducens]]'', ''S. putrefaciens'' and several species of ''[[Geobacter]]'', and directly form an insoluble [[mineral]] phase.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

The phenomenon of indirect enzymatic reduction is carried out by [[sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate-reducing]] and [[dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria]] on [[excretion]] reactions of [[metabolites]] and breakdown products. There is a coupling of the [[oxidation]] of [[organic acids]] —produced by the excretion of these [[Heterotroph|heterotrophic bacteria]]— with the reduction of [[iron]] or other [[metals]] and radionuclides, which forms insoluble compounds that can precipitate as [[oxide minerals|oxide]] and [[oxide minerals|hydroxide minerals]]. In the case of sulfate-reducing bacteria hydrogen sulfide is produced, promoting increased solubility of polluting radionuclides and their [[bioleaching]] (as liquid waste that can then be recovered).&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

There are several species of reducing microorganisms that produce indirect [[sequestering agents]] and specific [[chelation|chelators]], such as [[siderophores]]. These sequestering agents are crucial in the complexation of radionuclides and increasing their solubility and bioavailability. ''[[Microbacterium flavescens]]'', for example, grows in the presence of radioisotopes such as plutonium, thorium, uranium or americium and produces organic acids and siderophores that allow the dissolution and mobilization of radionuclides through the soil. It seems that siderophores on bacterial surface could also facilitate the entry of these elements within the cell as well. ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' also secretes chelating agents out that meet uranium and thorium when grown in a medium with these elements. In general, it has also been found that [[enterobactin]] siderophores are extremely effective in solubilizing actinide oxides of plutonium.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

==== Citrate complexes ====
[[Citrate]] is a chelator which binds to certain [[transition metals]] and radioactive actinides. Stable complexes such as [[denticity|bidentate]], [[denticity|tridentate]] (ligands with more than one atom bound) and polynuclear complexes (with several radioactive atoms) can be formed with citrate and radionuclides, which receive a microbial action. Anaerobically, ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'' and species of the genera ''[[Shewanella]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' are able to reduce bidentate complexes of [[uranyl-citrate]] (VI) to uranyl-citrate (IV) and make them precipitate, despite not being able to degrade metabolically complexed citrate at the end of the process.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; In denitrifying and aerobic conditions, however, it has been determined that it is not possible to reduce or degrade these uranium complexes. Bioreduction do not get a head when they are citrate complex mixed metal complexes or when they are tridentate, monomeric or polynuclear complexes, since they become [[recalcitrant]] and persistent in the environment.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=6.

=== Biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization ===
[[File:Biosorption, biomineralization and bioaccumulation of radionuclides (en).png|500px|right|thumb| Biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization strategies with a specific role for each cell compartment.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;]]
{{main|Biosorption|Bioaccumulation|Biomineralization}}
The set of strategies that comprise biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization are closely related to each other, because one way or another have a direct contact between the cell and radionuclide. These mechanisms are evaluated accurately using advanced analysis technologies such as [[electron microscopy]], [[X-ray diffraction]] and [[XANES]], [[EXAFS]] and [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectroscopies]].&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phosphate"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ae/2014/786929/|title=Phosphate-Mediated Remediation of Metals and Radionuclides|format=Web|year=2014|journal=Advances in Ecology|publisher=Hindawi Publishing|doi=10.1155/2014/786929|first1=R.J|last1=Martinez|first2=M.J|last2=Beazley|first3=P.A|last3=Sobecky|volume=2014|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biosorption and bioaccumulation are two metabolic actions that are based on the ability to concentrate radionuclides over a thousand times the concentration of the environment. They consist of complexation of radioactive waste with [[phosphates]], organic compounds and [[sulfites]] so that they become insoluble and less exposed to radiotoxicity. They are particularly useful in [[biosolids]] for [[agricultural]] purposes and [[soil amendments]], although most properties of these biosolids are unknown.&lt;ref name="developments"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11157-005-2170-y|title=Developments in bioremediation of soils and sediments polluted with metals and radionuclides: 2. Field research on bioremediation of metals and radionuclides|last1=Hazen|first1=T.C|last2=Tabak H.H|year=2005|journal=Reviews in Environmental Science and Bio/Technology|publisher=Springer|format=PDF|volume=4|issue=3|pages=157–183|doi=10.1007/s11157-005-2170-y|issn=1572-9826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biosorption method is based on passive sequestration of positively charged radioisotopes by [[lipopolysaccharides]] (LPS) on the [[cell membrane]] (negatively charged), either live or dead bacteria. Its efficiency is directly related to the increase in temperature and can last for hours, being a much faster method than direct bioreduction. It occurs through the formation of [[biofilm|slimes]] and capsules, and with a preference for binding to the [[phosphate]] and [[phosphoryl]] groups (although it also occurs with [[carboxyl]], [[amine]] or [[sulfhydryl]] groups). ''[[Firmicutes]]'' and other bacteria like ''[[Citrobacter freudii]]'' have significant biosorption capabilities; ''[[Citrobacter]]'' does it through [[electrostatic interaction]] of uranium with phosphates of their LPS.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Quantitative analyzes determine that, in the case of uranium, biosorption may vary within a range between 45 and 615 [[milligrams]] per gram of cell [[dry weight]]. However, it is a technique that requires a high amount of biomass to affect bioremediation; it presents problems of [[binding site|saturation]] and other cations that compete for binding to the bacterial surface.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Bioaccumulation refers to uptake of radionuclides into the cell, where they are retained by complexations with negatively charged intracellular components, precipitation or [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] formations. Unlike biosorption, this is an [[Active transport|active process]]: it depends on an energy-dependent transport system.&lt;ref name="intech"/&gt; Some metals or radionuclides can be absorbed by bacteria accidentally because of its resemblance to [[dietary elements]] for [[metabolic pathways]]. Several radioisotopes of [[strontium]], for example, are recognized as analogs of [[calcium]] and incorporated within ''[[Micrococcus luteus]]''.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt; [[Uranium]], however, has no known function and is believed that its entry into the cell interior may be due to its toxicity (it is able to increase [[membrane permeability]]).&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;
[[File:Chernikovite 1.jpg|thumb|210px|left|[[Chernikovite]] and [[meta-autunite]], radioactive minerals result of possible biomineralization.]]
Furthermore, biomineralization —also known as bioprecipitation— is the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of radionuclides through the generation of microbial ligands, resulting in the formation of stable [[Biogenic substance|biogenic minerals]]. These minerals have a very important role in the retention of radioactive contaminants. A very localized and produced enzymatically ligand concentration is involved and provides a [[nucleation site]] for the onset of biomineral precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=2.3 Biomineralization/Bioprecipitation|page=178|title=Radionuclides in the Environment: Influence of chemical speciation and plant uptake on radionuclide migration|first1=C|last1=Walther|first2=D.K|last2=Guptha|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783319221717|place=Switzerland|format=Web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7_YCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=2.3+Biomineralization/Bioprecipitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=62v7XQuYZe&amp;sig=b5_UzK7BlkglRJ9woyMHnGCTiEs&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcupqP2-_MAhWJDBoKHcbfAkkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=2.3%20Biomineralization%2FBioprecipitation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly relevant in precipitations of [[phosphatase]] activity-derivate biominerals, which cleavage molecules such as [[glycerol phosphate]] on [[periplasm]]. In ''[[Citrobacter]]'' and ''[[Serratia]]'' genera, this cleavage liberates inorganic phosphates (HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) that precipitates with uranyl ion (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and cause deposition of [[Crystallite|polycrystalline minerals]] around the cell wall.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=24.

Investigations of terrestrial and marine bacterial isolates belonging to the genera ''[[Aeromonas]]'', ''[[Bacillus]]'', ''[[Myxococcus]]'', ''[[Pantoea]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Rahnella]]'' and ''[[Vibrio]]'' have also demonstrated the removal of uranium radioisotopes as phosphate biominerals in both [[oxygen|oxic]] and [[oxygen|anoxic]] growth conditions.&lt;ref name="phosphate"/&gt;

=== Biostimulation and bioaugmentation ===
{{main|Biostimulation|Bioaugmentation}}
[[File:Evolution of the Old Rifle Processing Site.jpeg|thumb|280px|right|Evolution of the Old Rifle [[Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action|UMTRA]] Site ([[Colorado]], [[US]]) from 1957 (above) until 2008 (below), in which biostimulation tasks were carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/1895/|format=Web|title=In Situ Biostimulation of Uranium Reducing Microorganisms at the Old Rifle UMTRA Site|first1=Y|last1=Chang|year=2005|publisher=University of Tennessee|place=Knoxville}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Aside from bioreduction, biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization, which are bacterial strategies for natural attenuation of radioactive contamination, there are also human methods that increase the efficiency or speed of microbial processes. This accelerated natural attenuation involves an intervention in the contaminated area to improve conversion rates of radioactive waste, which tend to be slow. There are two variants: biostimulation and bioaugmentation.&lt;ref name="nabir goals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lbl.gov/NABIRarchive/researchprogram/strategicplan/goals.html|title=II. Program Goals and Management Strategy|format=Web|author=Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research|editor=[[United States Department of Energy]]|access-date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biostimulation is the addition of nutrients with [[trace elements]], [[electron donors]] or [[electron acceptors]] to stimulate activity and growth of natural [[indigenous microbial]] communities.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nabir goals"/&gt; It can range from simple [[fertilization]] or infiltration (called passive biostimulation) to more aggressive injections to the ground, and is widely used at [[United States Department of Energy|US DOE]] sites.&lt;ref name="developments"/&gt; [[Nitrate]] is used as nutrient to biostimulate the reduction of [[uranium]], because it serves as very energetically favorable [[electron acceptor]] for [[Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria|metal-reducing bacteria]]. However, many of these microorganisms (''[[Geobacter]]'', ''[[Shewanella]]'' or ''[[Desulfovibrio]]'') exhibit [[R gene|resistance genes]] to [[heavy metals]] that limit their ability to bioremediate radionuclides. In these particular cases, a carbon source such as [[ethanol]] is added to the medium to promote the reduction of nitrate at first, and then of [[uranium]]. Ethanol is also used in soil injection systems with [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|recirculations]]: it raises the [[pH]] and promotes the growth of [[denitrifying bacteria|denitrifying]] and radionuclide-reducing bacteria, that produce [[biofilms]] and achieve almost 90% decrease in the concentration of radioactive uranium.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

A number of [[geophysics|geophysical]] techniques have been used to monitor the effects of in situ biostimulation trials including measurement of: [[spectral ionization potential]], [[self potential]]s, [[current density]], [[complex resistivity]] and also [[reactive transport modelling]] (RTM), which measures [[hydrogeology|hydrogeological]] and [[geochemistry|geochemical]] parameters to estimate chemical reactions of the microbial community.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Bioaugmentaton, on the other hand, is the deliberated addition to the environment of microorganisms with desired traits to accelerate bacterial metabolic conversion of radioactive waste. They are often added when necessary species for bioremediation do not exist in the treatment place.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nabir goals"/&gt; This technique has shown in field trials over the years that it does not offer better results than biostimulation; neither it is clear that introduced species can be distributed effectively through the complex geological structures of most [[subsurface]] environments or that can compete long term with the indigenous microbiota.&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="developments"/&gt;

=== Genetic engineering and omics ===
[[File:Deinococcus radiodurans.jpg|thumb|130px|right|''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' has much interest in [[genetic engineering]] for bioremediation of radioactive waste.]]
{{main|Genetic engineering|Omics}}
Omics, especially genomics and proteomics, allow identifying and evaluating [[genes]], [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]] involved in radionuclide bioremediation, apart from the structural and functional interactions that exist between them and other metabolites. [[Genome sequencing]] of various microorganisms has uncovered, for example, that ''[[Geobacter sulfurreducens]]'' possess more than 100  [[coding region]]s for [[Cytochrome c|c-type cytochromes]] involved in bioremediation radionuclide, or that ''NiCoT'' gene is significantly overexpressed in ''[[Rhodopseudomonas palustris]]'' and ''[[Novosphingobium aromaticivorans]]'' when grown in medium with radioactive [[cobalt]].&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

From this information, different genetic engineering and [[recombinant DNA]] techniques are being developed to generate specific bacteria for bioremediation. Some [[DNA construct|constructs]] expressed in microbial species are [[phytochelatins]], [[histidine|polyhistidines]] and other [[polypeptides]] by [[Fusion protein|fusion-binding domains]] to outer-membrane-anchored proteins.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; Some of these genetically modified strains are derived from ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'', one of the most radiation-resistant organisms. ''D. radiodurans'' is capable to resist [[oxidative stress]] and [[DNA damage]] from radiation, and reduces [[technetium]], [[uranium]] and [[chromium]] naturally as well. Besides, through insertion of genes from other species it has been achieved that it can also precipitates [[uranyl phosphates]] and degrades [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] by using [[toluene]] as an energy source to grow and stabilize other priority radionuclides.&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

[[Directed evolution]] of bacterial proteins related to bioremediation of radionuclides is also a field research. [[YieF]] enzyme, for example, naturally catalyzes the reduction of [[chromium]] with a very wide range of [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]]. Following [[protein engineering]], however, it has also been able to participate in [[uranyl ion]] reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=A.C|last1=Matin|title=Development of combinatorial bacteria for metal and radionuclide bioremediation|editor=Stanford University|publisher= DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information|year=2006|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/883649|format=PDF|place=Stanford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Phytoremediation}}
[[File:Phytoremediation Process - svg.svg|thumb|right|380px|Phytoremediation processes. Radionuclides can not be phytodegraded but converted to more stable or less toxic forms.]]
The use of plants to remove contaminants from the environment or to render them less harmful is called phytoremediation. In the case of radionuclides, it is a viable technology when decontamination times are long and waste are scattered at low concentrations.&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Phytoremediation of soils contaminated with radionuclides|pages=43–69|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569486006100030|title=Radioactivity in the Terrestrial Environment|editor1-first=G|editor1-last=Shaw|first1=N|last1=Willey|first2=C|last2=Collins|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080474892|volume=10|doi=10.1016/S1569-4860(06)10003-0|format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trends"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1022527207359|title=Trends in phytoremediation of radionuclides|year=2003|doi=10.1023/A:1022527207359|issn=1573-5036|first1=S|last1=Dushenkov|journal=Plant and Soil|volume=249|issue=1|pages=167–175|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|format=Web|place=Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plant species are able to transform the state of radioisotopes (without suffering toxicity) concentrating them in different parts of their structure, making them rush through the roots, making them volatile or stabilizing them on the ground. As in bacteria, plant [[genetic engineering]] procedures and biostimulation —called [[phytostimulation]]— have improved and accelerate these processes, particularly with regard to [[fast-growing plants]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt; The use of ''[[Agrobacterium rhizogenes]]'', for example, is quite widespread and significantly increases radionuclide uptake by the [[Root|roots]].&lt;ref name="celso"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/genetic-transformation/transgenic-plants-for-enhanced-phytoremediation-physiological-studies|chapter=Chapter 16.

===Phytoextraction===
{{main|Phytoextraction}}
In phytoextraction (also phytoaccumulation, phytosequesteration or phytoabsorption)&lt;ref name="kumar"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=4. Phytoremediation techniques|pages=9–14|editor1-first=D|editor1-last=Kumar|editor2-first=C|editor2-last=Walther|place=Hannover|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iz4qBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=Kumar,+D;+Walther,+C.+«4.+Phytoremediation+techniques».+A:+Radionuclide+Contamination+and+Remediation+Through+Plants&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TqPstHR3aj&amp;sig=8gS3LIvI1gWC0l4fCOKEEoIW_qM&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHgMK9svLMAhVCahoKHRCYBywQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Kumar%2C%20D%3B%20Walther%2C%20C.%20«4.%20Phytoremediation%20techniques».%20A%3A%20Radionuclide%20Contamination%20and%20Remediation%20Through%20Plants&amp;f=false|title=Radionuclide Contamination and Remediation Through Plants|isbn=9783319076652|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; plants carry radioactive waste from the [[root system]] to the [[vascular tissue]] and become concentrated in the [[biomass]] of shoots. It is a technique that removes radionuclides without destroying the soil structure, with minimal impact on [[soil fertility]] and valid for large areas with a low level of radioactivity. Its efficiency is evaluated through [[bioaccumulation coefficient]] (BC) or total removal of radionuclides per [[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], and is proven to attract [[cesium-137]], [[strontium-90]], [[technetium-99]], [[cerium-144]], [[plutonium-240]], [[americium-241]], [[neptunium-237]] and various radioisotopes of [[thorium]] and [[radium]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt; By contrast, it requires large biomass production in short periods of time.&lt;ref name="celso"/&gt;

Species like [[common heather]] or [[amaranths]] are able to concentrate cesium-137, the most abundant radionuclide in the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]]. In this region of [[Ukraine]], [[mustard greens]] could remove up to 22% of average levels of cesium activity in a single growing season. In the same way, [[bok choy]] and mustard greens can concentrate 100 times more [[uranium]] than other species.&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

===Rhizofiltration===
[[File:Reedbeds - geograph.org.uk - 380204.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Connected pond system at [[River Dearne]] ([[England]]).]]
{{main|Rhizofiltration}}
Rhizofiltration is the adsorption and precipitation of radionuclides in plant roots or absorption thereof if soluble in effluents. It has great efficiency in the treatment of [[cesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]], particularly by [[algae]] and [[aquatic plants]], such as ''[[Cladophora]]'' and ''[[Elodea]]'' genera, respectively. It is the most efficient strategy for bioremediation technologies in [[wetlands]],&lt;ref name="kumar"/&gt; but must have a continuous and rigorous control of [[pH]] to make it an optimal process.&lt;ref name="celso"/&gt;

From this process, some strategies have been designed based on sequences of [[ponds]] with a slow [[Fluid dynamics|flow]] of water to clean polluted water with radionuclides. The results of these facilities, for flows of 1000 liters of effluent are about 95% retention of radiation in the first pond (by plants and [[sludge]]), and over 99% in three-base systems.&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

The most promising plants for rhizofiltration are [[sunflowers]]. They are able to remove up to 95% of [[uranium]] of contaminated water in 24 hours, and experiments in [[Chernobyl]] have demonstrated that they can concentrate on 55&amp;nbsp;kg of plant [[dry weight]] all the cesium and strontium radioactivity from an area of 75 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (stabilized material suitable for transfer to a nuclear waste repository).&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

===Phytovolatilization===
{{main|Phytovolatilization}}
Phytovolatilization involves the capture and subsequent [[transpiration]] of radionuclides into the [[atmosphere]]. It does not remove contaminants but releases them in volatile form (less harmful). Despite not having too many applications for radioactive waste, it is very useful for the treatment of [[tritium]], because it exploits plants' ability to transpire enormous amounts of water.&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kumar"/&gt;

The treatment applied to tritium (shielded by air produces almost no external radiation exposure, but its incorporation in water presents a health hazard when absorbed into the body) uses polluted effluents to [[irrigation|irrigate]] [[phreatophyte]]s. It becomes a system with a low operation cost and low maintenance, with savings of about 30% in comparison to conventional methods of [[pumping (oil well)|pumping]] and covering with [[asphalt]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

===Phytostabilization===
{{main|Phytostabilization}}
Phytostabilization is an specially valid strategy for radioactive contamination based on the immobilization of radionuclides in the soil by the action of the roots. This can occur by adsorption, absorption and precipitation within root zone, and ensures that radioactive waste can not be dispersed because [[soil erosion]] or [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]]. It is useful in controlling tailings from strip and open pit uranium mines, and guarantees to retrieve the [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kumar"/&gt; However, it has significant drawbacks such as large doses of [[fertilizer]] needed to reforest the area, apart from radioactive source (which implies long-term maintenance) remaining at the same place.&lt;ref name="celso"/&gt;

== Fungal bioremediation ==
[[File:Chernobyl nuclear plant2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Radiotrophic fungi]] growth has been described in reactor 4 at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station]].]]
{{main|Mycoremediation}}
Several fungi species have radioactive resistance values equal to or greater than more radioresistant bacteria; they perform mycoremediation processes. It was reported that some fungi had the ability of growing into, feeding, generating [[spores]] and decomposing pieces of [[graphite]] from destroyed [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus|reactor No. 4]] at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station]], which is contaminated with high concentrations of [[cesium]], [[plutonium]] and [[cobalt]] radionuclides. They were called [[radiotrophic fungi]].&lt;ref name="casadevall"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677413/pdf/nihms82938.pdf|first1=E|last1=Dadachova|first2=A|last2=Casadevall|title=Ionizing Radiation: how fungi cope, adapt, and exploit with the help of melanin|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|year=2008|volume=11|issue=6|pages=525–531|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2008.09.013|publisher=Elsevier|format=PDF|pmc=2677413|pmid=18848901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, it has been shown that some species of ''[[Penicillium]]'', ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'' and ''[[Xerocomus]]'' are able to use [[ionizing radiation]] as energy through the electronic properties of [[melanins]].&lt;ref name="casadevall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814601001716|title=A review of edible mushroom radioactivity|first1=P|last1=Kalac|journal=Food Chemistry|year=2001|volume=75|issue=1|pages=29–35|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(01)00171-6|format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their feeding they bioaccumulate radioisotopes, creating problems on [[concrete]] walls of [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=236–266|chapter=Fungal dissolution and transformation of minerals: significance for nutrient and metal mobility|first1=M|last1=Fomina|first2=E.P|last2=Burford|first3=G|last3=M.

== Ways of research ==
Current research on bioremediation techniques is fairly advanced and molecular mechanisms that govern them are well known. There are, however, many doubts about the effectiveness and possible adversities of these processes in combination with the addition of [[agrochemicals]]. In soils, the role of [[mycorrhizae]] on radioactive waste is poorly described and sequestration patterns of radionuclides are not known with certainty.&lt;ref name="pergamon"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Soil contamination with radionuclides and potential remediation|first1=Y.G|last1=Zhu|first2=G|last2=Shaw|journal=Chemosphere|publisher=Elsevier|volume=41|year=2000|issue=1-2|doi=10.1016/S0045-6535(99)00398-7|pmid=10819188|pages=121–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longevity effects of some bacterial processes, such as maintenance of uranium in insoluble form because of bioreductions or biomineralizations, are unknown. There are not clear details about the [[electronic transfer]] from some radionuclides with these bacterial species either.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Another important aspect is the change of ''[[ex situ]]'' or laboratory scale processes to their real application ''[[in situ]]'', in which soil heterogeneity and environmental conditions generate reproduction deficiencies of optimal biochemical status of the used species, a fact that decreases the efficiency. This implies finding what are the best conditions in which to carry out an efficient bioremediation with anions, metals, organic compounds or other chelating radionuclides that can compete with the uptake of interest radioactive waste.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; Nevertheless, in many cases research is focused on the extraction of soil and water and its ''ex situ'' biological treatment to avoid these problems.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

Finally, the potential of [[GMOs]] is limited by [[Regulation of the release of genetically modified organisms|regulatory agencies]] in terms of [[Social responsibility|responsibility]] and [[bioethics|bioethical]] issues. Their release require support on the action zone and comparability with indigenous species. Multidisciplinary research is focused on defining more precisely necessary [[genes]] and [[proteins]] to establish new [[free-cell]] systems, which may avoid possible side effects on the environment by the intrusion of [[transgenic]] or [[invasive species]].&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

'''Clovis points''' are the characteristically-fluted [[projectile points]] associated with the New World [[Clovis culture]]. They are present in dense concentrations across much of North America; in South America, they are largely restricted to the north of that continent. Clovis points date to the Early [[Paleoindian]] period roughly 13,500 to 12,800 calendar years ago. Clovis fluted points are named after the city of [[Clovis, New Mexico]], where examples were first found in 1929 by Ridgely Whiteman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdsmt.edu/wwwsarc/collectn/stone/clovis.html |title=A Clovis Spear Point |publisher=South Dakota State Historical Society |work=Archaeological Research Center |date=2004-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518092509/http://www.sdsmt.edu/wwwsarc/collectn/stone/clovis.html |archivedate=2009-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical Clovis point is a medium to large [[lanceolate]] point. Sides are parallel to convex, and exhibit careful pressure flaking along the blade edge. The broadest area is near the midsection or toward the base. The base is distinctly concave with a characteristic flute or channel flake removed from one or, more commonly, both surfaces of the blade. The lower edges of the blade and base are ground to dull edges for [[haft (sword)|haft]]ing. Clovis points also tend to be thicker than the typically thin later-stage [[Folsom point]]s. with length ranging from {{convert|4|–|20|cm}} and width from {{convert|2.5|–|5|cm}}. Whether the points were knife blades or spear points is an open question.

== Description ==
[[File:Clovis Rummells Maske.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Clovis points from the Rummells-Maske Cache Site, [[Iowa archaeology|Iowa]]]]
Clovis points are thin, fluted projectile points created using [[bifacial]] percussion flaking (that is, each face is flaked on both edges alternatively with a [[percussor]]).&lt;ref name=Justice1995 &gt;{{citation | last=Justice | first=Noel D. | year=1995 | title=Stone age spear and arrow points of the midcontinental and eastern United States: a modern survey and reference | edition=reprint | publisher=Indiana University Press | isbn=978-0-253-20985-6  | page=17 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1TgpCrn3gKUC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; To finish shaping and sharpening the points they are sometimes [[lithic reduction|pressure flaked]] along the outer edges.

Clovis points are characterized by concave longitudinal shallow grooves called "flutes" on both faces one third or more up from the base to the pointed tip;  The grooves may have permitted the points to be fastened ([[hafting|hafted]]) to wooden [[spear]]s, [[Dart (missile)|dart]] shafts or [[foreshaft]]s (of wood, bone, etc.) that would have been socketed onto the tip end of a spear or dart. Clovis points could also have been hafted as knives whose handles also served as removable foreshafts of a spear or dart. (This hypothesis is partly based on analogy with aboriginal harpoons that had tethered foreshafts Cotter 1937).  There are numerous examples of post-Clovis era points that were hafted to foreshafts, but there is no direct evidence that Clovis people used this type of technological system.

Specimens are known to have been made of  [[flint]], [[chert]], [[jasper]], [[chalcedony]] and other stone of [[conchoidal fracture]].  Ivory and bone atlatl hooks of Clovis age have been archaeologically recovered. Known bone and ivory tools associated with Clovis archaeological deposits are not considered effective foreshafts for projectile weapons.  The idea of Clovis foreshafts is commonly repeated in the technical literature despite the paucity of archaeological evidence. The assembled multiple piece spear or dart could have been thrown by hand or with the aid of an [[atlatl]] (spear thrower).

== Age and cultural affiliations ==
Whether Clovis toolmaking technology was native to the Americas or originated through influences from elsewhere is a contentious issue among archaeologists. [[Stone tool|Lithic]] antecedents of Clovis points have not been found in northeast [[Asia]], from where the first human inhabitants of the Americas are believed by the majority of archaeologists to have originated. Strong similarities with points produced by the [[Solutrean]] culture in the [[Iberian peninsula]] of Europe have been noted, leading to the controversial [[Solutrean hypothesis]], that the technology was introduced by hunters traversing the Atlantic ice-shelf, meaning some of the first American humans were European.

Around 10,000 radio carbon years [[before present]], a new type of fluted projectile point called [[Folsom point|Folsom]] appeared in archaeological deposits, and Clovis-style points disappeared from the continental United States. Most Folsom points are shorter in length than Clovis points and exhibit different fluting and pressure flaking patterns. This is particularly easy to see when comparing the unfinished preforms of Clovis and Folsom points.

Besides its function as a tool, Clovis technology may well have been the lithic symbol of a highly mobile culture that exploited a wide range of faunal resources during the Late [[Pleistocene]] and early [[Holocene]]. As Clovis technology expanded, its very use may have affected resource availability, being a possible contributor to the [[Quaternary extinction event|extinction]] of the [[megafauna]].

There are different opinions about the emergence of Clovis points. One is that pre-Clovis people in the [[New World]] developed the Clovis tradition independently. Another opinion is that [[Upper Paleolithic]] peoples who, after migrating into North America from northeast Asia, reverted to inherited Clovis-style flaked-[[stone technology]] that had been in use prior to their entry into the Americas.

== Distribution ==
Clovis points were first discovered near the city of [[Clovis, New Mexico]], and have since been found over most of North America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpluhna.nau.edu/People/paleoindians.htm |first=Scott A |last=Elias |title=Paleoindian and Archaic Peoples |work=People of the Colorado Plateau |publisher=[[Northern Arizona University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221092940/http://cpluhna.nau.edu/People/paleoindians.htm |archivedate=2012-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as far south as [[Venezuela]]. Significant Clovis finds include the [[Anzick site]] in [[Montana]]; the [[Blackwater Draw]] type site in New Mexico; the [[Colby site]] in Wyoming; the [[Gault site]] in [[Texas]]; the [[Simon site]] in [[Idaho]]; the [[East Wenatchee Clovis Site]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]; and the [[Fenn cache]], which came to light in private hands in 1989 and whose place of discovery is unknown. Clovis points have been found northwest of  [[Dallas]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/278370]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, a major Clovis cache, now called the [[Mahaffey Cache]], was found in [[Boulder, Colorado]], with 83 Clovis stone tools. The tools were found to have traces of horse and cameloid protein. They were dated to 13,000 to 13,500 [[Before Present|YBP]], a date confirmed by sediment layers in which the tools were found and the types of protein residues found on the artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/1124c0243883c267a7759da4bc4a2902.html |title=13,000-Year-Old Stone Tool Cache in Colorado Shows Evidence of Camel, Horse Butchering |author= |date=February 25, 2009 |work= |publisher=[[University of Colorado at Boulder]] |accessdate=22 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016151722/http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/1124c0243883c267a7759da4bc4a2902.html |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fluted obsidian point from a site near Rancho San Joaquin, Baja California Sur was found in a private collection in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0138r88b |title=An Obsidian Fluted Point from Central Baja California |author=Hyland, )Justin R, University of California, Berkeley; Gutierrez, Maria De La Luz, Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, La Paz, BCS Mexico |year=1995 |work= |publisher=[[Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology, UC Merced Library, UC Merced]] |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The point was surface collected several years earlier from an alluvial terrace approximately 14&amp;nbsp;km. to the south of San Ignacio.

[[File:Crocodile Clip.jpg|thumb|A crocodile clip manufactured by Mueller Electric. This device is a variation of Mueller's original crocodile clip design, which was invented by Ralph Mueller in the early 1900s.]]

[[image:Alligator clips 444.jpg|thumb|Pair of standard clips]]

A '''crocodile clip''' (also '''alligator clip'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://info.muellerelectric.com/the-complete-guide-to-clips/ |title= Guide to Clips|last= |first= |date=February 19, 2018 |website=Mueller Electric |publisher=Mueller Electric |access-date=February 19, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a sprung metal clip with long, serrated jaws which is used for creating a temporary [[electrical connection]]. This simple mechanical device gets its name from the resemblance of its jaws to that of an [[alligator]]'s or [[crocodile]]'s. It is used to connect an electrical cable to a battery or some other component. Functioning much like a spring-loaded [[clothespin]], the clip's tapered, serrated jaws are forced together by a [[spring (device)|spring]] to grip an object. When manufactured for electronics testing and evaluation, one jaw of the clip is typically permanently crimped or soldered to a wire, or is bent to form the inner tubular contact of a ~4&amp;nbsp;mm female [[banana connector|banana jack]], enabling quick non-permanent connection between a circuit under test and laboratory equipment or to another [[electrical circuit]]. The clip is typically covered by a plastic shroud or "boot" to prevent accidental short-circuits.

Small versions, ranging in size from 15–40&amp;nbsp;mm in length, are used in electrical [[laboratory]] work. 

Large versions of these clips, called '''automotive clips''' or '''battery clamps''', are made of solid [[copper]] for low [[electrical resistance]], and are used with thick insulated copper cables to make connections between automobile batteries. These '''[[Jump_start_(vehicle)#Jumper_cables|jumper cables]]''' are capable of delivering hundreds of Amperes of current needed to directly power an automobile starter motor, or to transfer energy from a charged [[lead-acid battery]] to a discharged one.

== Specifications ==

The United States Defense Logistics Agency specifies several types of electrical clips in Commercial Item Description (CID) A-A-59466. In this CID document, crocodile clips are designated type CC, alligator clips are designated types TCx, and other types of electrical clips have various other, unique designations.&lt;ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
* Dentistry: crocodile clips are often used on the ends of a cord in [[dentistry|dental]] offices to attach a protective bib over the patient's clothing.
* Laboratory: crocodile  clips are frequently used to quickly and cheaply assemble or modify experimental circuits. They are useful for connecting components to wires.
* Education: like their laboratory use, crocodile clips are sometimes used with batteries, small lightbulbs and other small electrical devices in schools to teach students about electricity.
* Fencing: crocodile  clips are used in [[fencing]] to connect to participants' [[lamé (fencing)|lamé]] vests to touch-detection systems.
* Hobby: crocodile clips can be used as miniature clamps to hold parts together for [[adhesive|gluing]] or [[soldering]].
** '''[[Helping hand (tool)|Helping Hands]]''' typically have two crocodile clips.
* Camping: crocodile clips may be designed to attach a rope to a tarp or other sheet of material. (While this serves the same purpose as a grommet, it may lead to premature wear at the point of attachment.)
* Drug use: as a '''[[roach clip]]''' for holding burning [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to avoid burning fingers.
* Erotic use: as a clamp upon one's nipples for sexual gratification.  See [[nipple clamp]] for more information on this usage.
* Film/animation: useful for airborne scenes in possible stop-motion or holding models of any sort in mid air.
* Electronics: useful as a [[heat sink]] while soldering heat-sensitive devices.

== Kelvin clip ==
A Kelvin clip is a special form of crocodile clip. The jaws of a Kelvin clip are insulated from each other, allowing 2 isolated wires to connect to a single test point. This enables [[four-terminal sensing|4-wire measurement]] of circuits with very low resistances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10618">'''Deal-of-the-day''' (also called '''daily deal''' or '''flash sales''' or '''one deal a day''') is an [[ecommerce]] business model in which a website offers a single product for sale for a period of 24 to 36 hours. Potential customers register as members of the deal-a-day websites and receive online offers and invitations by email or [[social network]]s.

{{As of|2011}}, deal-of-the-day sites have continued to grow in popularity, although new concerns have arisen over the longevity of the concept and the financial viability of one-day deals for small businesses.&lt;ref name=Dholakia&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1863466 |last1=Dholakia |first1=Utpal M. |title=How Businesses Fare with Daily Deals: A Multi-Site Analysis of Groupon, Livingsocial, Opentable, Travelzoo, and BuyWithMe Promotions |date=June 13, 2011 |work=Social Science Research Network, Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The deal-of-the-day concept gained popularity with the launching of [[Woot|Woot.com]] in July 2004, although Woot itself was a modified version of earlier [[dot-com bubble]] sites such as [[uBid]]. By late 2006, the deal-of-the-day industry had greatly expanded to over 100 deal-a-day sites. In November 2008, [[Groupon]] entered the market and became the second fastest online company to reach a billion-dollar valuation.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Christopher. [https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0830/entrepreneurs-groupon-facebook-twitter-next-web-phenom.html “Meet The Fastest Growing Company Ever”], Forbes Magazine, August 30, 2010, retrieved October 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Other online businesses, including Facebook,&lt;ref&gt;Barr, Alistair. [https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/26/us-facebook-deals-idUSTRE77P6Q820110826 “Facebook ending Deals product after four-month test], Reuters, August 26, 2011, retrieved October 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Google Offers|Google]] tested their own daily deal sites, withdrawing them after they proved unsuccessful. However, the rise of social networks, such as Facebook and Myspace, has accelerated the growth of daily deals sites, allowing popular deals to [[Viral marketing|spread virally]].

==Business model overview==
The deal-of-the-day business model works by allowing retailers to market discounted services or products directly to the customers of the deal company, who receives a portion of the retailer's profit. This allows retailers to build brand loyalty and quickly sell surplus inventory.

The majority of deal-of-the-day sites work directly with local businesses and online retailers to develop deals significantly discounted compared to [[recommended retail price]]s. Using a [[group buying]] formula, a minimum and maximum number of deals are made available. Typically, deal of the day sites segment merchandise by specific designer sales.&lt;ref&gt;Sheft- Ason, Jessica. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicasheft-ason/2011/08/09/gilt-groupe-launches-editorial-site-for-men-competes-with-amazon/ "Gilt Groupe Launches Editorial Site For Men, Competes With Amazon"], Forbes,  August 9, 2011, retrieved October 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2013}} Deals are typically only offered for 24 hours, although daily deal websites are increasingly offering alternative, longer deal buying periods to increase sales and allow multiple deals to run in a single location concurrently.

Descriptions of the deals are often emailed to customers when the deal goes live, sometimes with creative or humorous descriptions. The practice of sending these emails has been criticized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/7291-groupon-your-email-marketing-is-failing-your-audience |title=Groupon: your email marketing is failing your fans |first=Phillip |last=Storey |work=econsultancy.com |date=April 11, 2011 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by e-mail marketing professionals and users. However, evidence suggests this aggressive strategy is effective at generating sales.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Some sites allow members to receive an e-mail either daily or weekly or to be notified of all current offers. Customers purchase the deal on the deal-of-the-day website, rather than directly from the retailer. The websites then retain the customer data, rather than the retailer.

Once the minimum number of deals have been sold, customers' credit cards are charged, and the deal is delivered as an electronic voucher redeemable at the retailer or service provider's location. The promotional value of the vouchers purchased from deal-of-the-day websites typically expire after a certain period but maintain the original value paid.

Common products and services sold through deal-of-the-day websites include apparel, restaurants and bars, salons and spas, special events, health and fitness products, and travel packages.

==Marketing==
Most businesses which run contracts with daily deal websites consider doing so as a marketing activity rather than a direct means of generating profit. Between the deep discount offered as part of the deal and the payout to the deal-of-the-day site, the businesses may net little or no profit (effectively making the deals [[loss leader]]s). There is evidence that these businesses gain significant increases in overall sales due to the amount of exposure gained from running a one-day deal. Many customers who purchase daily deals are "price-sensitive deal-seekers" who are unlikely to return to the business in the future without similar discounts.&lt;ref&gt;Dholakia, Utpal. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2011/09/23/what-daily-deal-shoppers-want/ “What Daily-Deal Shoppers Want”], Forbes, September 23, 2011, retrieved October 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have shown that for small businesses and start-ups, daily deals can result in a substantial 30% increase in profits. A survey of businesses who ran daily deals in the past year revealed that more than half (55.5%) profited on their daily deal promotion, whereas just over a quarter (26.6%) lost money. The remainder (17.9%) broke even.&lt;ref name=Dholakia/&gt; Beyond mere exposure, these businesses hope to capitalize on the long-term value of new repeat customers. Thus deal-of-the-day sites also function as marketing platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Cain Miller, Claire.

A study of small businesses revealed that on average, daily deal spending is the single largest expenditure in a company's marketing budget, at 23.5%, which translates to average annual spending on daily deal programs of $46,530. Lesser expenditures include e-mail promotions (16.1% or $31,878) and online search advertising through programs such as Google [[AdWords]] (14.7% or $29,106).&lt;ref name=Dholakia/&gt;

==Affiliates==
Most daily deal websites have an [[affiliate marketing]] program, allowing third-party websites to be paid for referring visitors, increasing the presence of the deal-of-the-day sites. These websites display syndicated offers from a number of deals sites, based on location and which categories of deal a user is interested in receiving.&lt;ref&gt;Saint, Nick. [http://articles.businessinsider.com/2010-06-30/tech/29973484_1_groupon-aggregators-daily-deal#ixzz1ZGlN4oPC “Groupon Aggregator Yipit Raises $1.3 Million In Venture Funding”], Business Insider, June 30, 2011, retrieved October 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These aggregators earn a percentage of any sales made by the deal sites through their affiliate program.

==Industry outlook==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=March 2013}}
Whereas 2010 was a year of rapid growth for the industry, daily deal sites began to slide in 2011 and 2012. Regardless, revenue forecasts for the industry continue to foresee strong growth. There has been a surge in the private shopping club sector with niche products and offerings such as luxury home ware and high-end food gaining in popularity. Analysts predicted that industry revenues would reach several billion dollars, at an increasing at annual rates in excess of 100% by the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Dholakia, Utpal M. and Tsabar, Gur.[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1828003 “A Startup’s Experience with Running a Groupon Promotion”], SSRN, May 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study released by BIA/Kelsey,{{clarify|date=March 2013}} gross revenues are projected to grow from a current $873 million to $3.9 billion by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Krug, Frances Mary. "Groupon And Other Deal-Of-The-Day Sites Booming". Search Marketing Standard, March 3, 2011, retrieved October 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The increase in [[venture capital]] injections and [[Startup company|startup]] launches demonstrates the continued growth of the industry. Examples of such activity include the recent launches of Facebook, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Google]], and [[AT&amp;T]]'s daily deal sites. Groupon filed for its [[Initial public offering|IPO]] in June 2011 and went public in November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Rusli, Evelyn M., [https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/a-good-day-for-groupon-and-internet-start-ups/ “A Good Day for Groupon and Internet Start-Ups”], SSRN, June 13, 2011, retrieved October 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Despite positive growth figures, some studies suggest there is a structural weakness to the industry that will have to be addressed. Such shortcomings exist on both the consumer and merchant sides of the industry. For example, deal users very rarely return for a full price purchase, and a large percentage of businesses indicate their disinterest in further deals in the future. Thus the industry may need to settle for lower shares of revenues from businesses compared to their current levels (20-50%), which are not sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;Frommer, Dan.[http://www.businessinsider.com/group-buying-2011-9 “Ignore The Groupon Hate: Group Buying Isn't Dying It's Just Getting Started”], Business Insider, September 1, 2011, retrieved October 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether industry diversification, increasing competition, and larger revenue shares for merchants will disrupt the industry leaders or cannibalize the industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Farrel, Maureen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8270">A '''deductive classifier''' is a type of [[artificial intelligence]] [[inference engine]]. It takes as input a set of declarations in a [[frame language]] about a domain such as medical research or molecular biology. For example, the names of [[Class hierarchy|classes, sub-classes]], properties, and restrictions on allowable values.  The classifier determines if the various declarations are logically consistent and if not will highlight the specific inconsistent declarations and the inconsistencies among them. If the declarations are consistent the classifier can then assert additional information based on the input. For example, it can add information about existing classes, create additional classes, etc. This differs from traditional inference engines that trigger off of IF-THEN conditions in rules. Classifiers are also similar to [[Automated theorem proving|theorem provers]] in that they take as input and produce output via [[First Order Logic]]. Classifiers originated with [[KL-ONE]] [[Frame language]]s. They are increasingly significant now that they form a part in the enabling technology of the [[Semantic Web]]. Modern classifiers leverage the [[Web Ontology Language]]. The models they analyze and generate are called [[Ontologies (computer science)|ontologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|first2=James|last2=Hendler|first3=Ora|last3=Lassila|title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities|journal=Scientific American|date=May 17, 2001|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34|volume=284|pages=34–43|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|archivedate=April 24, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A classic problem in [[knowledge representation]] for artificial intelligence is the trade off between the expressive power and the computational efficiency of the knowledge representation system. The most powerful form of knowledge representation is First Order Logic (FOL). However, it is not possible to implement knowledge representation that provides the complete expressive power of first order logic. Such a representation will include the capability to represent concepts such as the set of all integers which are impossible to iterate through. Implementing an assertion quantified for an infinite set by definition results in an undecidable non-terminating program. However, the problem is deeper than not being able to implement infinite sets. As Levesque demonstrated, the closer a knowledge representation mechanism comes to FOL, the more likely it is to result in expressions that require infinite or unacceptably large resources to compute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levesque|first=Hector|title=Reading in Knowledge Representation|year=1985|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=0-934613-01-X|page=49|author2=Ronald Brachman |editor=Ronald Brachman and Hector J. Levesque|chapter=A Fundamental Tradeoff in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning|quote=The good news in reducing KR service to theorem proving is that we now have a very clear, very specific notion of what the KR system should do; the bad new is that it is also clear that the services can not be provided... deciding whether or not a sentence in FOL is a theorem... is unsolvable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this trade-off, a great deal of early work on knowledge representation for artificial intelligence involved experimenting with various compromises that provide a subset of FOL with acceptable computation speeds. One of the first and most successful compromises was to develop languages based predominately on [[modus ponens]], i.e. IF-THEN rules. [[Rule-based systems]] were the predominate knowledge representation mechanism for virtually all early [[expert systems]]. Rule-based systems provided acceptable computational efficiency while still providing powerful knowledge representation. Also, rules were highly intuitive to knowledge workers. Indeed, one of the data points that encouraged researchers to develop rule-based knowledge representation was psychological research that humans often represented complex logic via rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|pages=6–7|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas|last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after the early success of rule-based systems there arose more pervasive use of frame languages instead of or more often combined with rules. Frames provided a more natural way to represent certain types of concepts, especially concepts in subpart or subclass hierarchies. This led to development of a new kind of inference engine known as a classifier. A classifier could analyze a class hierarchy (also known as an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]) and determine if it was valid. If the hierarchy was invalid the classifier would highlight the inconsistent declarations. For a language to utilize a classifier it required a formal foundation. The first language to successfully demonstrate a classifier was the KL-ONE family of languages. The [[Loom (ontology)|LOOM language]] from ISI was heavily influenced by KL-ONE.  LOOM also was influenced by the rising popularity of object-oriented tools and environments. Loom provided a true object-oriented capability (e.g. message passing) in addition to Frame language capabilities. Classifiers play a significant role in the vision for the next generation Internet known as the Semantic Web. The Web Ontology Language provides a formalism that can be validated and reasoned on via classifiers such as Hermit and Fact++.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacGregor|first1=Robert|title=A Descriptive Classifier for the Predicate Calculus|journal=AAAI - 94 Proceedings|date=1994|url=http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1994/AAAI94-033.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''desaxe engine''', is one in which each [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] is positioned with its exact center (the bore axis) slightly offset from the center line of the [[crankshaft]].  "Désaxé", in French, means "unbalanced".  Desaxe engines are usually [[automotive]], but the term can also apply to [[steam engine]]s. 


[[Image:Scuderi Split Cycle Engine - Cycle.gif|right|thumb|An animation of a [[Scuderi engine|Scuderi Split Cycle Engine]].]]

If the offset is in the direction of rotation, it has the effect of increasing the [[lever]]age applied to the crankshaft during the "power" stroke, and reducing thrust wasted against the cylinder wall.

In a conventional [[four-stroke engine]], each of the strokes (intake, compression, power, exhaust) involves a nominal rotation of 180°, totaling 720° for the complete [[Four-stroke engine|4-stroke combustion cycle]]. A desaxe engine adds to the duration of the two downward strokes (intake and power), and subtracts the same amount from the two upward strokes (compression and exhaust), with the total remaining 720°. A typical desaxe engine will have strokes of 185° - 175° - 185° - 175°, etc., with the differential roughly (but not directly) proportional to the percentage of offset distance to stroke length.

The relative proportion of offset distance versus stroke length ranges from very small to almost 20%; viz. an engine with an 80&amp;nbsp;mm stroke may have a cylinder offset of 20&amp;nbsp;mm.

Early adopters of the Desaxe Principle included [[Henry Ford]] who would fully implement the Desaxe offset into the [[Ford Flathead V8 engine]] throughout the 1930s while adopting greater offsets into the 1940s.

Use of desaxe engines is now becoming more common.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}.  The Volkswagen [[VR6 engine|VR6 &amp; VR5 engines]] have desaxe cylinders, with an offset of 12.5&amp;nbsp;mm. The front bank cylinders are offset forward of the crank while the rear are offset rearward.  The [[Toyota Prius]] has desaxe cylinder bores offset by 13&amp;nbsp;mm.  The new [[Yamaha MT-09|MT-09]] motorcycle is the first Yamaha with desaxe pistons. Ford has a new series of engines called dragon series that have an offset crank shaft.

All single crank [[split-single]] engines such as those used by [[DKW]] and [[Puch]] had, by necessity, highly desaxe cylinders.

The [[Scuderi engine]], as shown in the animated illustration, has highly desaxe cylinders. The compressor (blue) is offset a greater amount than the power cylinder (yellow).  Its benefit is to give a better [[line of thrust]] from piston to crank though con-rod during downward power stroke but it has disadvantages in vibration and bore wall thrust.

Essentially a form of giant printmaking, with the explosive acting as the stamping press, it was created by [[Evelyn Rosenberg]] in 1986 with the help of the engineers of [[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology]] in [[Socorro, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/art/incendiary-art-evelyn-rosenberg-s-detonography/article_248bd70c-6976-5b6e-892d-97d9e3b1e88c.html |title=Incendiary art: Evelyn Rosenberg’s detonography |last=Abatemarco |first=Michael |date=October 11, 2013 |website=santafenewmexican.com |access-date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process can create complex surfaces with delicate etched designs, even welding dissimilar metals. The results are lightweight, durable indoor and out, and relatively vandalproof.  This process essentially [[Repoussé and chasing|embosses]] the metal, but with a raised image instead of a depressed one.

Rosenberg has produced more than 40 detonographic works for public buildings around the United States and abroad.

'''Drive testing''' is a method of measuring and assessing the coverage, capacity and [[Quality of service|Quality of Service]] (QoS) of a mobile radio network.

The technique consists of using a motor vehicle containing [[Mobile radio|mobile radio network]] [[air interface]] measurement equipment that can detect and record a wide variety of the physical and virtual parameters of mobile cellular service in a given geographical area.

By measuring what a wireless network subscriber would experience in any specific area, wireless carriers can make directed changes to their networks that provide better coverage and service to their customers.

Drive testing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drive-testing.com/index.php/vitrogis|title=Official website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Drive testing|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires a mobile vehicle outfitted with drive testing measurement equipment. The equipment are usually highly specialized electronic devices that interface to OEM mobile handsets. This ensures measurements are realistic and comparable to actual user experiences.

==Data collected during drive testing==
Drive test equipment typically collects data relating to the network itself, services running on the network such as voice or data services, radio frequency scanner information and GPS information to provide location logging.

The data set collected during drive testing field measurements can include information such as:&lt;ref&gt;Drive testing for LTE&lt;/ref&gt;

*Signal intensity
*Signal quality
*Interference
*Dropped calls
*Blocked calls
*Anomalous events
*Call statistics
*Service level statistics
*Quality of Service information
*Handover information
*Neighboring cell information
*GPS location co-ordinates

==Types of drive testing==
Drive testing can broadly be categorized into three distinct topics:

*Network benchmarking.
*Optimization and troubleshooting
*Service quality monitoring.

The result produced by drive testing for each of these purposes is different.

===Network benchmarking===
For benchmarking, sophisticated multi-channel tools such as Focus Infocom's DMTS and XGMA, DingLi Communications' Pilot Fleet, [[Ascom (company)|Ascom]]'s Symphony, [[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]]-[[SwissQual]]'s Diversity Benchmarker or [[Keysight]] Nemo Invex II are used to measure several network technologies and service types simultaneously to very high accuracy, to provide directly comparable information regarding competitive strengths and weaknesses. Results from benchmarking activities,such a comparative coverage analysis or comparative data network speed analysis, are frequently used in marketing campaigns. Drive testing to gather network bench-marking data is the only way mobile network operators can collect accurate competitive data on the true level of their own and their competitors technical performance and quality levels.

===Optimization and troubleshooting===
Optimization and troubleshooting information is more typically used to aid in finding specific problems during the rollout phases of new networks or to observe specific problems reported by consumers during the operational phase of the network lifecycle. In this mode drive testing data is used to diagnose the root cause of specific, typically localized, network issues such as dropped calls or missing neighbour cell assignments.

===Service quality monitoring===
Service quality monitoring typically involves making test calls across the network to a fixed test unit to assess the relative quality of various services using [[Mean Opinion Scores|Mean opinion score]] (MOS). Quality monitoring focuses on the end user experience of the service, and allows mobile network operators to react to what effectively subjective quality degradations by investigating the technical cause of the problem in time-correlated data collected during the drive test. Service quality monitoring is typically carried out in an automated fashion, using devices that run largely without human intervention carried in vehicles that regularly ply typical drive testing routes such as garbage collection vehicles, taxis or buses.

Drive testing can be conducted at any time on a live network and very rarely will there be any network intrusion.

[[File:ElCoP logo.svg|thumb|ElCoP Logo]]

'''e-Learning Developers' Community of Practice''' or '''ElCoP''' is practice developed following a decision of European [[Air Navigation Service Provider|air navigation service]] (ANS) training providers together with [[Eurocontrol]], to create an [[e-learning]] developers [[community of practice]] in January 2009.

The aims of this community of practice are: to share knowledge and information on [[e-learning]] development matters between its members; to develop common deliverables; and to improve Eurocontrol deliverables, such as the best practice documentation for [[e-learning]] development and the digital learning asset sharing platform.

==History==
Historically, ElCoP is the successor to the e-Learning Developers’ Task Force (EDTF), which was created in 2006 to develop a network of European e-learning developers involved in ANS training.

This group had the tasks of developing best practices in e-learning development and a platform which would enable users to share digital learning assets.

Even though EDTF finished these tasks in 2008, its members believed that there was added value in keeping a community of practice alive which would enable participants to learn from each other, to share best practices and to develop common deliverables. They suggested ElCoP.

ElCoP started work in the first quarter of 2009.

[[Environmental design]] is an emerging topic in [[railroad]] technology.  Over the past twenty-five years, fuel efficiency in diesel locomotives has increased 85%,&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web |title=AAR: Environment |publisher=Association of American Railroads. |url=http://www.aar.org/Environment/Environment.aspx |accessdate=June 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127034357/http://www.aar.org/Environment/Environment.aspx |archivedate=January 27, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing these trains to go farther and move more freight while using less fuel.  New low-impact [[Electric locomotive|electric]] and [[hybrid train]]s reduce overall carbon emissions.  Also, train manufacturers have started utilizing [[Alternative_propulsion#Hydrogen|hydrogen technology]] for propulsion, with carbon emissions only coming from the manufacturing of the hydrogen itself.

==Increasing efficiency while lowering emissions==

===Diesel trains===
[[Image:Db-220002-01-c.jpg|thumb|right|Diesel Train|200 px]]

[[Diesel locomotive|Diesel trains]] replaced the steam engine in the late 1920s as a cleaner more efficient way of moving people and goods.  Since 1980, the amount of freight being hauled by Diesel Trains has nearly doubled, yet the fuel consumption of trains has virtually stayed the same.&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt;  Estimates have shown that about {{convert|45|e9USgal|m3}} of fuel have been saved by increasing the efficiency in diesel trains.  US Department of Energy reported that commercial airline energy intensity per passenger mile was 3,587 BTU's, automobiles were 3,549 BTUs, while commuter rail energy intensity was just 2,751 BTUs, which indicates that rail transportation is the most energy efficient of the three.  [[Union Pacific Railroad|The Union Pacific Rail Road]] has implemented a particle filter on the their diesel engines.  Silicon carbide blocks trap particles from the exhaust as they leave the engine, greatly reducing emissions.&lt;ref name = "UPRR" &gt;{{cite web| title = UP: Environmental Management | publisher = Union Pacific Rail Road. | url = http://www.uprr.com/she/emg/index.shtml | accessdate = June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric trains===
[[Electric locomotive|Electric trains]] have always had no direct carbon emissions because they are run entirely by internal electric motors.  However, the means of generating the electricity used to power these motors was predominately by burning fossil fuels or coal, both of which produce a large amount of carbon emissions.  With the emergence of 'clean energy' generation, electrical trains actually run with very low environmental impact.  For example, the proposal for the high-speed rail line between [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]] in [[California]] has the potential for zero greenhouse gas emissions, with the 3,350 GWh each year being generated by California's extensive infrastructure of renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name = "site1" &gt;{{cite web| title = Californias-220-MPH-high-speed-train | publisher = CleanTechnica.com. | url = http://cleantechnica.com/2008/09/15/californias-220-mph-high-speed-train-will-be-emissions-free/ | accessdate = June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid trains===
[[Image:UNION PACIFIC Y2513 20070228.jpg|thumb|right|[[Railpower Technologies|RailPower]] [[GG20B]] ''Green Goat'' diesel-hybrid locomotive.|250 px]]

Since 1986, engineers have been developing electric-diesel [[Hybrid train|"hybrid" trains]].  One type of hybrid train implements battery power when the train is idling and at low speed movement, and a diesel engine at higher speeds.  To recharge the batteries, power from the diesel motor, charge utilizing [[regenerative braking]], or a combination of both is used.  According to the [[IEEE|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], hybrid trains reduce the carbon emissions of Diesel Trains by 19%.&lt;ref name = "site2" &gt;{{cite web| title = Thermo-Economic Analysis of Dual Mode Hybrid Trains: Abstract | publisher = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4272362&amp;isnumber=4272347 | accessdate = June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another type of hybrid train, such as the [[RailPower Technologies]] [[Railpower GG20B|Green Goat]], uses a large battery, and a small set of generators ("genset") for power.  The genset is run at a constant speed and is attached to a generator to replenish the battery.

===Hydrail===
Hydrogen propulsion is an emerging technology, and is currently being implemented in locomotives.  Hydrogen-powered trains dubbed "[[Hydrail]]" emit only water as a by product of combustion, and have a  zero direct greenhouse gas emission.  However, the process used to generate hydrogen in a form useful to power trains does produce a small amount of greenhouse gases.  By using wind energy and electrolysis, 6.85&amp;nbsp;grams of greenhouse gases per [[Joule#SI_multiples|MJ]] of [[Lower heating value|LHV]] are produced, which is an insignificant amount compared to the 22 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions from one gallon of gasoline.&lt;ref name = "site3" &gt;{{cite web| title = Recent Canadian Advances in Hydrail and Nuclear Based Hydrogen Production | publisher = Hydrail | url = http://www.hydrail.org/docs/5_stasko.pdf | accessdate = June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trains are prime targets for hydrogen propulsion due to their ability to store massive tanks of hydrogen.&lt;ref name = "site8" &gt;{{cite web| title = Hydrail: Hydrogen trains picking up steam? | publisher = Hydrail | url = http://www.wbtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=9014097 | accessdate = June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emissions comparison==
Rail transportation emits about 0.2 pounds of greenhouse gases per passenger mile (55&amp;nbsp;g/km) when each car is filled with 50 passengers. This figure increases to about 0.5 pounds per passenger mile (140&amp;nbsp;g/km) when only filled with half that amount.  These numbers are still much lower than those of Jet transportation, about 1 pound per passenger mile (280&amp;nbsp;g/km), and that of a solo car driver, about 1.15 pounds per passenger mile (325&amp;nbsp;g/km).  Even the fuel efficient [[Toyota Prius|Prius]] emits more greenhouse gases per passenger mile.&lt;ref name = "Sightline1" &gt;{{cite web| title = How Low-Carbon Can You Go: The Green Travel Ranking | publisher = Sightline Institute. | url = http://www.sightline.org/maps/charts/climate-CO2byMode/? | accessdate = December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates have shown that if just 10% of long-distance freight that is currently moving by truck were to be moved instead by diesel trains, the resulting carbon emission reduction would be the equivalent of taking 2 million cars off the road.&lt;ref name = "cite1" &gt;{{cite web| title = Green from the Start | publisher = Association of American Railroads. | url = https://www.aar.org/BackgroundPapers/Railroads%20and%20Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions.pdf | accessdate = December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The results are more dramatic when the diesel train figures are replaced by hybrid and electric train figures.

The '''F connector''' (also '''F-type''') is a [[coaxial]] [[RF connector]] commonly used for "over the air" [[terrestrial television]], [[cable television]] and universally for [[satellite television]] and [[cable modems]], usually with [[RG-6|RG-6/U cable]] or, in older installations, with [[RG-59|RG-59/U cable]].

The F connector was invented by Eric E. Winston in the early 1950s while working for [[Jerrold Electronics]] on their development of cable television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US3537065 Electrical Connector]. US Patent 3,537,065 by Eric Winston&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, it became commonplace on VHF, and later UHF, television antenna connections in the United States, as coaxial cables replaced [[twin-lead]].

It is now specified in [[IEC 60169]] Radio-frequency connectors, part 24{{efn|Radio frequency coaxial connectors with screw coupling, typically for use in 75 ohm cable networks (type F)}}.

== Description ==
The F connector is an inexpensive, gendered, threaded, compression connector for radio frequency signals. It has good 75&amp;nbsp;Ω [[impedance match]] for frequencies well over 1&amp;nbsp;GHz&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60169-24: "Radio-frequency connectors - Part 24: Sectional specification - Radio frequency coaxial connectors with screw coupling, typically for use in 75 Ω cable networks (type F)." (2009) [https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/4731]&lt;/ref&gt; and has usable [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] up to several GHz.

Connectors mate using a {{frac|3|8}}{{nbsp}}in-32 [[Unified Thread Standard|unified extra fine]] (UNEF) thread. The female connector has a socket for the center conductor and external threads. The male connector has a center pin, and a captive nut with internal threads.

The design allows for low-cost construction, where cables are terminated almost exclusively with male connectors. The [[coaxial cable]] center conductor forms the pin, and cable dielectric extends up to the mating face of the connector. Thus, the male connector consists of only a body, which is generally [[crimp (joining)|crimped]] onto or screwed over the cable shielding braid, and a captive nut, neither of which require tight tolerances. Push-on versions are also available.

Female connectors are typically used on bulkheads or as couplers, often being secured with the same threads as for the connectors. Thus can be manufactured as a single piece, with center sockets and dielectric, entirely at the factory where tolerances can easily be controlled.

This design is subject to the surface properties of the inner conductor (which must be solid wire, not stranded) and is not corrosion resistant. Hence waterproof versions are needed for outside use (for example, on antennas). Corrosion resistance can be improved by coating all bare copper wires with [[silicone grease]].

=== Weatherproof ===
The F connector is not weatherproof. Neither the threads nor the joint between male connector body and captive nut seal. However, male connectors are commonly enhanced with an [[o-ring]] (of about 7{{nbsp}}mm) inside the captive nut. This seals between the mating faces of both connectors, providing good waterproofing for the center conductor.

== Usage ==
The cable and satellite television entities (as a near standard practice) use compression fittings with F connectors on customer premises. In Europe, block down-converted satellite signals (950–2150&amp;nbsp;MHz) from LNBs and DC power and block signalling from satellite receivers are near exclusively passed through F connectors.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

F connectors are probably the most suitable for domestic terrestrial, cable, and satellite TV installations where the delivery of very high frequency information is required. [[Belling-Lee connector]]s (IEC 169-2; used on European terrestrial receivers) are not well suited for long-haul building delivery of frequencies above 500{{nbsp}}MHz, because the standard was designed around tube receivers and mediumwave (or shortwave) antennas (but workarounds{{clarify|date=November 2017}} exist).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithia.com/elect/bellinglee/ |title=How to wire a Belling-Lee connector |website=www.megalithia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; F connectors require slightly more care to properly install the male connectors to the cable than the Belling-Lee type, with the exception of compression or flex type connections.

==Flex F connectors ==
Push-on (aka Flex) F connectors provide poorer shielding against microwave signals of high [[field strength]]. This leakage problem is more an artifact of bent or partly broken push on connectors, but is mostly not observed with compression connectors. Nearby television, FM radio, mobile &amp; cordless phones, government [[radiolocation]] (54–1,002&amp;nbsp;MHz)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityfreq.com/ Cityfreq United States Scanner Frequencies, Phone Numbers, and IP Addresses.]&lt;/ref&gt; transmitters can potentially interfere with a CATV or DTH Satellite reception or operation if the Flex connector poorly installed.

'''Floor scrubber''' is a floor cleaning device. It can be simple tools such as [[floor mop]]s and [[Scrubber (brush)|floor brushes]], or in a form of walk-behind or ride-on machines to clean larger floor areas by injecting water with cleaning solution, scrubbing, and lifting the residuals off the floor.&lt;ref name=wisegeek&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tatum|first1=Malcolm|title=What Is a Floor Scrubber?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-floor-scrubber.htm|publisher=wiseGEEK|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thurston|first1=Sara A.|title=How to select floor-cleaning equipment for the highest efficiency and lowest total cost to clean|journal=Commercial Floor Cleaning Bulletin|issue=101|url=http://www.advance-us.com/~/media/4C2F92516ED54D86B45C0CDB23052280.ashx|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advancement in [[robotics]], [[Autonomous robot|autonomous]] floor-scrubbing robots are available as well.&lt;ref name=scooba&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alspach|first1=Kyle|title=IRobot 'reinvents' its floor-scrubbing robot, Scooba; selling for $600|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/techflash/2014/01/irobot-scooba-floor-scrubbing-robot.html|accessdate=12 September 2014|publisher=Boston Business Journal|date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automatic floor scrubbers==
[[Automation|Automatic]] floor scrubbers, also known as auto scrubbers, are a type of [[floor]] cleaning [[machine]] that are used to scrub a floor clean of light [[debris]], [[dust]], [[oil]], [[Fat|grease]] or floor marks. These machines have either [[rotary motion|rotary]](disk) or [[cylindrical]] scrubbing head and an automated system for dispensing cleaning [[solution]] and then vacuuming it up. So, in one pass over the floor, a user can dispense [[cleaning agent|cleaning]], scrub it into the floor, then [[vacuum]] it all up with an autoscrubber [[squeegee]] attachment at the back of the machine. Auto scrubbers have a separate dispensing (solution) [[tank]] and collection (recovery) tank to keep the clean [[water]] separate from the dirty water and can be categorized into one of three main types: walk behind, stand-on, and rider.

Floor scrubbers are a more hygienic alternative to traditional cleaning methods such as a mop and bucket.  Environmentally safe soaps can be used in conjunction with a reduced water system to save on both the amount of chemicals released into the environment as well as the amount of gray water produced.  Some floor scrubbers are even capable of cleaning without a water and chemical system at all.

Most autoscrubbers can't reach edges, corners, clean under obstructions such as drinking fountains, and can't fit into alcoves.  Therefore, mopping is needed to clean areas the autoscrubber can't reach.
Some manufacturers now produce Floor Scrubbers with Orbital / Oscillating brush decks allowing edges, corners and overhangs to be fully cleaned.

Modern floor scrubbers have a pre-sweep option that removes the need to sweep the floor before scrubbing. The pre-sweep brush head is placed in front of the vacuum system to collect dust and debris before it can block the vacuum system. In the past it was important to sweep the floor before scrubbing to remove any debris and dust that could clog the vacuum hose or build up in the vacuum motor, which can decrease performance.  If this happens, the vac hose may need to be removed to clear the obstruction and/or the vac motor may need to be blown out with compressed air.

Stripping Solution should never be used as it can cause damage to the solution dispensing system, but can still be vacuumed up by the machine without harm.  Occasionally, the solution system should be flushed with water mixed with vinegar to remove any soap and calcium deposits that could build in the solution system.

After each use, the dispensing (solution) and especially the collection (recovery) tanks should be emptied and rinsed out to prevent dirt build up. Also, the pads/brushes, vac hose, and squeegee should also be rinsed to prevent dirt build up.  The vac motor should be run for several minutes afterwards to remove any moisture that could be present in the vac motor to reduce chances of corrosion that could damage the vac motor.  Failure do to this maintenance could cause in a loss of vacuum airflow and increase in costly repairs.

===Types Of Automatic Floor Scrubber Heads===
There are 3 common types of automatic floor scrubber heads: Disk, Cylindrical, and Square Oscillating.&lt;ref&gt;http://floorscrubberhub.com/automatic-floor-scrubber-head-options/&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Disk Style Floor Scrubber Heads====
The most common, disk style floor scrubbers use a circular motion with a round pad or brush to agitate a cleaning solution against the floor to release soils. Disk floor scrubber heads work best on smooth floors.

====Cylindrical Style Floor Scrubber Heads====
Using counter rotating tube style brushes that rotates perpendicular to the floor, cylindrical floor scrubbers clean rough or uneven surfaces. Cylindrical brushes usually have a collection tray behind the brushes that can pick up larger debris such as rocks, screws and small bolts. This reduces the need to sweep or dust mop prior to scrubbing, although it is still a good idea if possible. 

====Square Oscillating Floor Scrubber Heads====
Similar to the disk style, square oscillating floor scrubbers use a flat pad to scrub the floor. The difference is that instead of spinning, it moves in a vibrating motion at a much faster speed. The square design allows for cleaning closer to walls and in corners. 
The high speed motion and down pressure also allow this style of floor scrubber head to be useful for removing floor finish from vinyl composite tile and well as prepare wood floors for refinishing. A specialized, abrasive pad is used for these procedures.

When floor scrubbing machines became more available to many types of facilities, there was a need to cover a different type of [[flooring]]. '''Floor buffers''' or '''rotary floor machines''' were invented to scrub and polish the floor with [[linoleum]] surface. The machines use rotary brushes with soft material to clean and make the floor shine. For marble and wood floors, floor polishers may be used to apply protective coating to floor.&lt;ref name=wisegeek/&gt;

It is also known as a  '''floor burnisher''' if it is a high speed floor buffer with a pad that rotates at over 1000 RPM. 

Closely resembling a large upright, wide-based [[vacuum cleaner]] with handlebar controls and requiring, until familiar with the machine, two-handed steering, a floor buffer uses one or more variable-speed circular rotary brushes to dislodge [[dirt]] and [[dust]] from and apply a polished finish to flat surfaces. They have a large, round scrubbing pad which is spun in one direction by a small [[Electric motor|motor]], usually mounted directly over the center of the pad.

Larger powered floor buffers are used in [[school]]s, [[hospital]]s, [[office]]s and [[public buildings]]. These have wheels and are powered to allow the user to easily move and clean items stuck on floors. Scaled-down versions are available for home use and often sold as hard floor cleaners.

=== Commercial ===

With the advancement in technologies used in [[autonomous robot]]s, floor-scrubbing robots were created by combining the features of automatic floor scrubbers with self-control operations without an operator. Non-residential models such as HydroBot by Intellibot Robotics are suitable for education, retail, healthcare and manufacturing facilities. The Intellibot commercial floor cleaning machines can clean {{Convert|10000|sqft|adj=on}} area in one hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=HydroBot Specs|publisher=Intellibot Robotics LLC|url=http://www.intellibotrobotics.com/downloads/HydroBot_Specs.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other applications of [[mobile robotics]], the capability of robotic floor scrubbers will increase over time, coinciding with the availability of improved sensors and computing components.  The latest generation of mobile robotics sensors includes [[LIDAR]] and [[Stereo camera|3D camera]]s, which are used in the newest robotic floor scrubbers, such as the Avidbots Neo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Avidbot-brochure-0907sm|publisher=Avidbots Corp.|url=http://www.avidbots.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Avidbot-brochure-0917sm.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LIDAR sensors allow a floor scrubber robot to detect surrounding walls and objects at a longer range, allowing the machine to determine its precise location in larger environments, such as malls and airports.

Unlike earlier residential cleaning robots that followed a random pattern when cleaning, commercial floor scrubber robots tend to have a precise plan for cleaning, allowing these robots to cover the entire floor in a predictable pattern each time they clean.  They miss very few spots on the floor, since they know exactly where they've just cleaned and where they still need to clean.  Robotic floor scrubbers are also designed to navigate around people and obstacles that they encounter during autonomous operation.

=== Residential ===

Floor-scrubbing robots are also available in a small form factor for residential applications.  The [[Scooba (brand)|Scooba]] by [[iRobot]] is one example.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8365">[[The Open Group]] '''Future Airborne Capability Environment''' (FACE Consortium) was formed in 2010 to define an open [[avionics]] environment for all military airborne platform types. Today, it is a real-time software-focused professional group made up of industry suppliers, customers, academia, and users. The FACE approach is a government-industry software standard and business strategy for acquisition of affordable software systems that promotes innovation and rapid integration of portable capabilities across programs. The FACE Consortium provides a vendor-neutral forum for industry and government to work together to develop and consolidate the open standards, best practices, guidance documents, and business strategy necessary to result in:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/face/consortium FACE Consortium Information, uploaded with permission]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Standardized approaches for using open standards within avionics systems
*Lower implementation costs of FACE systems
*Standards that support a robust architecture and enable quality software development
*The use of standard interfaces that will lead to reuse of capabilities
*[[Software portability|Portability]] of applications across multiple FACE systems and vendors
*Procurement of FACE conformant products
*More capabilities reaching the customer faster
*Innovation and competition within the avionics industry
 
The FACE Technical Standard is an open real-time standard for making safety-critical computing operations more robust, interoperable, portable and secure. Although the consortium started with a focus on avionics, the applicability of the technical standard and its associated data model have become much broader. The standard enables software developers to create and deploy a wide catalog of applications for use across the entire spectrum of real-time systems through a common operating environment. The latest edition of the standard further promotes application interoperability and portability with enhanced requirements for exchanging data among FACE components, including a formally specified data model, and emphasis on defining common language requirements for the standard.

== Background ==
The FACE effort sprang from US Navy [[open architecture]] programs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/gardner/face-initiative-takes-aim-at-improved-interoperability-and-standards-among-future-military-avionics-platforms/3776 FACE initiative takes aim at improved interoperability and standards among future military avionics platforms]&lt;/ref&gt; promoted by the US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), to enhance interoperability and software portability for avionics software applications across DoD aviation platforms. Both the US Army and US Air Force have been participating in the consortium. NAVAIR led the pack with early acquisitions, followed later by Army and Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensedaily.com/open-group-av-8b-c-130t-will-be-first-to-meet-navys-face-avionics-software-standards/ AV-8B, C-130T Will Be First To Meet Navy’s FACE Avionics Software Standards] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.army.mil/article/158626/Joint_Multi_Role_Program_is_preparing_for_Future_Vertical_Lift_Mission_Systems_Architectures/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.opengroup.us/face/documents/18467/Infinite_Dimensions_Prototype_Paper_Air_Force_FACE_TIM_v6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The FACE Consortium was formed by The Open Group as a "Voluntary Consensus Standards Body", as defined by the National Technology Transfer Act and [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a119 OMB Circular A-119]. This facilitates government participation in the consortium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.opengroup.org/face/faqs FACE™ Consortium : Frequently Asked Questions] &lt;/ref&gt; One goal of the effort is to reduce the typical development and deployment cycle of new capabilities in military airborne platforms from as long as six years under the current methodology to as little as six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviationweek.com/awin/us-navy-army-push-open-airborne-computing U.S. Navy, Army Seek Open-Airborne Computing]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FACE reference architecture ecosystem includes software product conformance verification and certification processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengroup.org/face/conformance|title=FACE Conformance {{!}} The Open Group|website=www.opengroup.org|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2016, a suite of flight management software earned the first FACE certificate of conformance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://airsoc.com/articles/view/id/580e0e24313944b47c8b4567/rockwell-collins-receives-the-first-face-conformance-certificate-for-rnp-rnav-capable-fms|title=ROCKWELL COLLINS RECEIVES THE FIRST FACE™ CONFORMANCE CERTIFICATE FOR RNP RNAV CAPABLE FMS - airsoc.com|last=TeamAirsoc|newspaper=Airsoc.com|language=en|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One may view information on all certified FACE conformant products at the [https://www.facesoftware.org/ FACE Registry]

==Technical approach==
The FACE technical approach tackles barriers to software modularity, portability, and [[interoperability]] by defining a Reference Architecture and employing design principles to enhance software portability. To meet the objectives of the technical approach, the FACE Technical Standard uses a standardized architecture describing a conceptual breakdown of functionality, called the FACE Reference Architecture, to promote the reuse of software components able to share common functionality across disparate systems. This architecture defines standardized interfaces to allow software components to be moved between systems, including those developed by different vendors. The standardized interfaces follow a data architecture to ensure the data communicated between the software components is fully described to facilitate their integration on new systems.
[[File:FACE Reference Architecture.png|thumb|left|FACE Reference Architecture]]
The FACE Reference Architecture is composed of logical segments where variance occurs. The structure created by connecting these segments together is the foundation of the FACE Reference Architecture. The five (5) segments of the FACE Reference Architecture are the Operating System Segment (OSS), Input/Output Services Segment (IOSS), Platform-Specific Services Segment (PSSS), Transport Services Segment (TSS), and Portable Components Segment (PCS).

The FACE Reference Architecture defines a set of standardized interfaces providing connections between the FACE architectural segments. The standardized interfaces within the FACE Reference Architecture are the Operating System Segment Interface (OSS Interface), the Input/Output Services Interface (IOS Interface), the Transport Services Interfaces, and Component-Oriented Support Interfaces.

The FACE Reference Architecture defines three FACE OSS Profiles tailoring the Operating System (OS) Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), programming languages, programming language features, run-times, frameworks, and graphics capabilities to meet the requirements of software components for differing levels of criticality. The three Profiles are Security, Safety, and General Purpose. The Security Profile constrains the OS APIs to a minimal useful set allowing assessment for high-assurance security functions executing as a single process. The Safety Profile is less restrictive than the Security Profile and constrains the OS APIs to those that have a safety certification pedigree. The General Purpose Profile is the least constrained profile and supports OS APIs meeting real-time deterministic or non-real-time, non-deterministic requirements depending on the system or subsystem implementation.

The FACE Data Architecture defines the FACE Data Model Language (including the language binding specification), Query and Template language, FACE Shared Data Model (SDM) and the rules of construction of the Unit of Portability (UoP) Supplied Model (USM). Each PCS Unit of Conformance (UoC), PSSS UoC, or TSS UoC providing using TS Interfaces is accompanied by a USM consistent with the FACE SDM and defines its interfaces in terms of the FACE Data Model Language. A Domain-Specific Data Model (DSDM) captures content relevant to a domain of interest and can be used as a basis for USMs.

'''Georges Peignot''' (Paris, June 24, 1872 &amp;ndash; Givenchy, September 28, 1915) was a French [[type designer]], [[Type foundry|type founder]] and manager of the [[G. Peignot et Fils|G. Peignot &amp; Fils foundry]] until his death in the [[World War I]]. Father of four children (including poet [[Colette Peignot]] called Laure), he hoisted the [[G. Peignot et Fils|G. Peignot &amp; Fils foundry]] among most striking French typography companies of the twentieth century (an ''« elite house »'',&lt;ref name="barthou2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barthou|first=Louis|date=July 1916|title=Lettres à un jeune français. XXV. La contagion sublime|journal=Les Annales|language=french|volume=|issue=1727|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to a former French Prime Minister): in 17 years of practice, he created or launched prestigious fonts, including [[Grasset typeface|Grasset]], [[Cochin typeface|Cochin]] and [[Garamond|Garamont]].

== Early years ==
Born in 1872, Georges Peignot was the fourth child of eight. His father, Gustave Peignot (1839–1899), engineer graduated of [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech|Arts et Métiers school]],&lt;ref name="jane3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Souvenirs de famille|last=Peignot-Tuleu|first=Jane|publisher=Deberny|year=1915|isbn=|location=Paris|page=23|language=french|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the head of a [[Letter-spacing|fixed spaces]] foundry (specialized in the fabrication of hand-set metal type to achieve letter-spacing) in Paris, created in 1842 by Pierre Leclerc&lt;ref name="jane3"/&gt; and bought and directed by his mother, Clémentine Dupont de Vieux Pont (1815–1897), widow of Laurent Peignot.
[[File:1883-g-peignot-fonderie-publicite.png|thumb|300px|Advertisement for Gustave Peignot's foundry, Georges' father, published in ''L'imprimerie'' magazine, in 1883.]]

Georges Peignot frequented unsuccessfully the [[Lycée Chaptal|Chaptal College]] in Paris, before attending an apprenticeship&lt;ref name="jane3"/&gt; with his godfather, Émile Faconnet, master [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printer.&lt;ref&gt;Faconnet, engraver, is a close friend of Marie Laporte-Peignot's parents (future wife of Gustave Peignot, father of Georges) and future Georges' godfather. A portrait of Marie Laporte-Peignot, girl, has been painted by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Auguste Renoir]]; it can be seen at Limoges museum, region of Renoir's family.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he was admitted to [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|"Arts Déco" school]]. In 1891, he moved to Germany, first in [[Leipzig]] in the Schwinger foundry where he discovered the world of printing and learned [[punchcutting]]. In 1892, he was in [[Hamburg]] in the [[Genzsch &amp; Heyse, A.G.|Gentzsch foundry]]&lt;ref&gt;« Avant le front » ("Before the font"). Postcard from Hermann Genzsch to Georges Peignot, 1915 (?) &amp; letter from Charles Peignot to M. Genzsch, 1926 (see Bibliothèque Forney, Fonds Peignot, B2/D8)&lt;/ref&gt; where, with the son of the family, same age, he toured the services and workshops, continued to be passionate about types, and passed all his spare time admiring international typographic catalogs.

Back in France in 1893, Georges Peignot spent two and a half years in military service, where he graduated sergeant, the highest rank for those who do not have the [[Baccalaureate (France)|baccalaureate]]. In 1896, he married Suzanne Chardon, daughter of a master [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printer in charge of [[chalcography]] for the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Chardon's workshops may be still seen at 10, rue de l'Abbaye, in Paris (courtyard).&lt;/ref&gt; They had four children (Charles, 1897; Madeleine, 1899; Geneviève, 1900; Colette, 1903).[[File:Logo-g-peignot-et-fils.png|thumb|Logo for the new G. Peignot et Fils foundry, which Georges Peignot will manage for 17 years, until his death]]
In 1896, hired in his father's owned "G. Peignot" foundry, Georges Peignot was responsible for the management of recently acquired types (G. Peignot et Fils has had absorbed Cochard &amp; David foundry and Longien foundry) and possibly for creating new fonts.&lt;ref name="froissart2"&gt;{{Citation|title=L’or, l’âme et les cendres du plomb.

Peignot et Fils" and distributed the shares to his 8 children. He had time to appoint Georges co-manager before dying the following year. In 1899, Georges Peignot became officially sole manager of the company. Board members were Robert Peignot, eldest son, engineer in charge of manufacturing, Georges Peignot, and Charles Tuleu, husband of Jane Peignot, the eldest daughter, and owner of the rival foundry Deberny. In 1906, Paul Payet, husband of Julia Peignot, the second daughter and close ally from Gustave Peignot's widow, top executive in a railways company, joined the board on the instruction of the widow.&lt;ref&gt;See notarial records of November 6, 1898 (Bibliothèque Forney, Peignot Fund, B6 / D). See also "Plate XXXI. - Contract between Gustave and his two eldest, Robert and George" in {{Citation|title=L’or, l’âme et les cendres du plomb.

At the behest of Georges Peignot's mother, a second contract will include the step-brother and competitor, Charles Tuleu, and will replace the original (Bibliothèque Forney, Peignot Fund, B1 / D1, B1 / D2)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grasset (1898) ==
[[File:Grasset_Italic.png|thumb|alt=Grasset typeface|Grasset italic (1898), created by [[Eugène Grasset]]]]

In 1897, Georges Peignot, young industrialist aged 25, met [[Eugène Grasset]] already famous in the [[Art Nouveau]] world (for his furniture, posters, stamps, titles and patterns of books, textiles and printed wallpapers, etc.). Grasset has had freely adapted to the alphabet of [[Nicolas Jenson]] (1471) with the intention of using it to print a book on his own method for ornamental composition, inspired by the courses he gave to the Guérin school. With his father's agreement, Georges Peignot acquired Grasset's alphabet, get an official patent October 7, 1897 for the typeface under the name "Grasset" and gave Henri Parmentier, the workshop's punchcutter, the mission to engrave it. For harmonious compositions, he decided to offer 13 sizes of the same type, and ''« for the first time in a French workshop, the scale of sizes of a character is created by photographic reductions of a genuine drawing »'' ([[Francis Thibaudeau|Thibaudeau]]). In the fall of 1898 comes out, printed in Grasset, ''Les aventures merveilleuses de Huon de Bordeaux, chanson de geste'' (a medieval novel, since the Middle Age is the favorite epoch of Art Nouveau). The world of typography was alerted and revealed very supportive. In 1900, only 7 sizes were punched, but orders showed up. Georges Peignot and Francis Thibaudeau, high-quality master typographer he has hired, created a small catalog, discreet but very tasteful. After the sending to all important printers, the orders flocked to the company, and in the same time compliments praised from specialized press and art connoisseurs. In the courtyard of the Boulevard de Montrouge (later renamed "boulevard Edgar-Quinet") where they settled for 34 years, the Peignot workshops were suddenly engorged.&lt;ref&gt;On the Boulevard Edgar-Quinet (numbers 66, 68, 70 and 72) in Paris, workshops and apartments are now destroyed. But the entrance door still carries a « PL » monogram (Peignot-Laporte)!&lt;/ref&gt; The company has had to move at the corner of Cabanis and Ferrus streets (XIV&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; arrondissement) in Paris, and the new plant opens in 1904.

The success meant for Georges Peignot, 29, the recognition of his peers: he became treasurer of the Chambre syndicale (typographic trade association). His work was also copied: in June 1902 the justice seized forged types of Renault foundry and the two foundries went on court. Surprisingly, the infringement case has been lost in 1905 and the company G. Peignot &amp; Fils has had to pay the costs for… having accused Renault foundry of being inspired by Gryphe work, a Lyon publisher of the sixteenth century, amateur of Jenson, whose work belongs to all and can be copied. The judges have had no regard for the particular draw of reed and other specific qualities of Grasset.

Two of Georges Peignot's brothers, Robert (engineer of [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech|Arts et Métiers]]) and Lucien (engineer of the [[École Centrale Paris|École centrale]]), sailed to the United States where they know they could find the most modern automatic typographic machines.&lt;ref&gt;''« 6.9.1902. Le paquebot Lorraine emporte pour New York, Chicago, mes deux fils Robert et Lucien… (The Lorraine cruiser carries to New York, Chicago, my two sons Robert and Lucien…) »'', {{cite book|title=Souvenirs|last=Laporte-Peignot|first=Marie|publisher=unpublished|year=1923|isbn=|location=Paris|page=|language=french|id=}} (Bibliothèque Forney, Fonds Peignot)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Auriol and other fonts (1902) ==
[[File:Auriol Italic.png|alt=Police d'écriture Auriol italique, gravée par George Auriol à la demande de Georges Peignot|thumb|Auriol italic (1904), created by [[George Auriol]]]]

In 1898, Georges Peignot ordered an Art Nouveau typeface to [[George Auriol]] (aka Georges Huyot), a gifted singer-poet-painter. A year later, Auriol proposed already "la Française-légère". Georges Peignot filed it October 11, 1899, and launched the punchcutting despite family's opposition.&lt;ref name="froissart3"&gt;{{Citation|title=L’or, l’âme et les cendres du plomb. L'épopée des Peignot, 1815-1983|date=2004|last1=Froissart|first1=Jean-Luc|pages=|place=Paris|publisher=librairie Tekhnê|language=french|isbn=2-9522836-0-5}} (''Gold, Soul and Ashes of Lead: the Epic of Peignot'')&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 the complete alphabet was available in five sizes. Success was around the corner again, but the career of the new typeface was not as productive as the Grasset: Française-légère is a fantasy typeface, unlike Didot or Garamond devoted to serious works, and it's intended for short texts, advertising, subtitles, etc. Therefore, the use is not so frequent, nor the replacement of lead fonts: for a foundry, it's not a good deal.

During the following years the fantasy production was still privileged: Georges Peignot's foundry launched "l’Auriol Labeur " (Auriol book, 1904), the "Française-allongée" (1905), "Auriol Champlevé" (1906), the series of eight "Robur" typefaces (black, pale, striped, ''clair-de-lune'', etc., 1907). Promoting these "fancy" characters, Georges Peignot played with the classic structure of the letter (unchanged since the fifteenth century), and took easily the risk that its customers would sacrifice readability to the beauty of characters, very "Art Nouveau". He advocated a "Typography", which meant – for him – that a typeface comes with many sizes, italics, vignettes and ornaments. Sort of typographic philosophy!

In the continuity, the foundry launched a series of ornaments and vignettes for the Grasset typeface. The creations of George Auriol were also enshrined in two series of ''« creepers, flowers, flames »'' that Francis Thibaudeau laid out in two booklets (''Vignettes Art Français'' et ''Ornements français'', 31 pages to be published again in the ''Spécimen général'' few months after). G. Peignot et Fils released also a booklet entitled ''Album d’application des nouvelles créations françaises'' (''Catalog for applications of new French creations,'' 1901), real pamphlet written by Francis Thibaudeau in favor of Art Nouveau.

== Publication of the ''Spécimen'' (1903) ==
Only after having launched "Grasset" (thirteen sizes) and "Française-légère" (five sizes), Georges Peignot decided to publish a ''Spécimen'' and thus to benefit from the enormous success of its new characters. All the fonts created or acquired by the G. Peignot &amp; Fils foundry were there available.

The ''Spécimen'' consists of two volumes of 450 and 200 pages (the first appears at the end of July 1903, the second in 1906). The layout is generous: 7 chapter headings in 4 colors, airy presentation of each typeface or ornament, often in two colors, with variation of different sizes, funny or informative sentences. Beneath their aesthetic success, the two volumes were also useful: all the technical details that can be used in a printshop were clearly set out in tables, lists, diagrams: return rates and prizes of old fonts, sizes of various folded formats, instructions on cutting lines, etc. The text is serious and didactic: the last chapter is written by Francis Thibaudeau, who paints a retrospective of typography and its scenery, from the Renaissance to present day.

== Cochin (1912) ==
[[File:Cochin.png|alt=Police d'écriture Cochin|thumb|Cochin (1912), created by Georges Peignot]]

Because the Grasset was slowing, Georges Peignot sought a new text dedicated typeface. In 1910, he launched the "Bellery-Desfontaines", an upscale fantasy character in rupture with Art nouveau style: any vegetal form was excluded.

Georges Peignot found inspiration in the engravings of the eighteenth century: supported by Lucien Peignot, his younger brother became co-manager and close friend, and by Francis Thibaudeau, his typography master, he noticed that the writers of this time rejected the solemn style of founders like Louis-René Luce, [[Pierre Simon Fournier|Fournier]], [[Didot family|Didot]]... and preferred to engrave themselves the text accompanying their illustrations. Georges Peignot was impassioned by the work of the writer and illustrator of [[Menus-Plaisirs du Roi|Menus-Plaisirs du roi]] : Cochin. He proposed then a new typeface, inspired by a design found in the archives (still anonymous today), gave it the name "Cochin" and submitted in October 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bases-modeles.inpi.fr/Typo3_INPI_Modeles/dessins_fiche_resultats.html?index=135|title=Police de caractères "Cochin italique", juin 1913|website=inpi.fr|accessdate=}}, {{Cite web|url=http://bases-modeles.inpi.fr/Typo3_INPI_Modeles/dessins_fiche_resultats.html?index=134|title=Police de caractères " Nicolas-Cochin", juin 1913|website=inpi.fr|accessdate=}}, {{Cite web|url=http://bases-modeles.inpi.fr/Typo3_INPI_Modeles/dessins_fiche_resultats.html?index=129|title=Caractère d'imprimerie dit "Moreau-le-Jeune", 1925|website=inpi.fr|accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was not all. He proposed a complete typeface suite, 2000 punches (in January 1914), composed of a "Nicolas-Cochin" stretched to the poles, a "Moreau-le-jeune" champlevé, and a 200 years old fantasy typeface, "Fournier-le-jeune". Last but not least, adequate decorations and decorated letters were entrusted to Pierre Roy and [[André Édouard Marty|André-Édouard Marty]], illustrators to ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]''.

In 1912, the Cochin suite was launched on the market in two different ways: the first coup recalled the publication of the medieval book for Grasset and consisted, before marketing the lead fonts, to compose in Cochin a new fashion magazine: ''[[La Gazette du Bon Ton]]'' (launched by Lucien Vogel of [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'']], the ''[[Le Jardin des Modes|Jardin des modes]]'', etc.). The success was great, not only because of Cochin only but also because the magazine wss beyond anything seen in terms of taste, quality of illustrations (mostly watercolors), discovery of new trends, etc. The second and most important promotional vehicle of Cochin was a high typographic quality booklet, published January 18, 1914, and sent to all Paris, including typographers, printers, artists, journalists… The trio composed by Georges Peignot, Lucien Peignot, and Francis Thibaudeau has had time to polish up their weapons of seduction: it took two years for cutting 62 alphabets, plus ornaments and vignettes. The result, as it was possible to admire it, was in the booklet, and the booklet itself: pink and gold cover, white and mid-tone laid paper, black, gold and color printing, examples or bilboquets on full pages, precious illustrations by the use of Roy and Marty vignettes… The text too, written by Lucien Peignot, is of excellent literary outfit.

== Garamont (1912) ==
[[File:EB Garamond.png|thumb|Garamont (1912), created by Georges Peignot]]

Thanks to Cochin suite and to some very profitable and recent acquisitions (thus the "[[Didot (typeface)|Didot]]" from the Beaudoire foundry), the profits of the company G. Peignot &amp; Fils rose to unforeseen heights. Unfortunately, Georges Peignot did not benefit because he was put in minority within the company's board after a maneuver of his own mother (who thereby expressed his hostility to the unloved son and his preference for his two eldest, Jane and Robert, that her husband had had previously excluded from company's decisions).&lt;ref name="froissart"&gt;{{Citation|title=L’or, l’âme et les cendres du plomb. L'épopée des Peignot, 1815-1983|date=2004|last1=Froissart|first1=Jean-Luc|pages=|place=Paris|publisher=librairie Tekhnê|language=french|isbn=2-9522836-0-5}} (''Gold, Soul and Ashes of Lead: the Epic of Peignot'')&lt;/ref&gt; Added to the personal attacks within his family, Georges Peignot has had also serious concern caused by constant improvements of automatic typographic machines he intended danger since 1905.&lt;ref&gt;To know the advantages and shortcomings of these new machines, Georges Peignot made the purchase of a copy for his company and offered it to consumers. The war did not allow to draw conclusions. When merging with Deberny, the danger becomes underestimate and will result to a slow death of the new company.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejected, depressed, Georges Peignot stepped back from the daily management of the company and confided it to his younger Lucien Peignot.

He was dedicated to the launch of a new character. He had noticed that the Garamond typeface of the sixteenth century has been created at a time when we printed on thick coton-based paper, in which the characters sank, leaving a greasy track. The same typeface used on a wood-based paper seemed thin. His idea was to re-draw the character with the original bold effect found on rag paper. He started manufacturing a new Garamont (''sic'') character with the help of engraver Henri Parmentier. The result will be presented and marketed in 1926 only,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Caractère d'imprimerie, 1928 |url = http://bases-modeles.inpi.fr/Typo3_INPI_Modeles/dessins_fiche_resultats.html?index=121|website = inpi.fr|accessdate = }}, {{Cite web|title = Caractère d'imprimerie, 1928 |url = http://bases-modeles.inpi.fr/Typo3_INPI_Modeles/dessins_fiche_resultats.html?index=122|website = inpi.fr|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 years after his death. It will be a great success, sustainable, prestigious.

Meanwhile, in 1910, Georges Peignot commissioned&lt;ref&gt;cf. letters of Bernard Naudin to Georges Peignot, about his typeface. (Bibliothèque Forney, Peignot Fund B13 / D)&lt;/ref&gt; the engraver Bernard Naudin for a new typeface in roman, italics and champlevé; the typeface is recorded in 1912 and 1913;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Caractères typographiques, dénommés "caractères français, dits de tradition", dessiné par Naudin |url = http://bases-modeles.inpi.fr/Typo3_INPI_Modeles/dessins_fiche_resultats.html?index=137|website = inpi.fr|accessdate =}}, {{Cite web|title = Italique du caractère français, dessiné par Naudin |url = http://bases-modeles.inpi.fr/Typo3_INPI_Modeles/dessins_fiche_resultats.html?index=136|website = inpi.fr|accessdate =}}, {{Cite web|title = Caractère d'imprimerie "Naudin blanc", 1921 |url = http://bases-modeles.inpi.fr/Typo3_INPI_Modeles/dessins_fiche_resultats.html?index=133|website = inpi.fr|accessdate = }}, {{Cite web|title = Alphabet de grandes initiales dessinées par Bernard Naudin, 1924 |url = http://bases-modeles.inpi.fr/Typo3_INPI_Modeles/dessins_fiche_resultats.html?index=132|website = inpi.fr|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it will be placed on the market in 1924, without much success.

== War, sacrifice, death (1915) ==
When [[World War I|World War]] is declared, Georges was mobilized as [[Adjutant|adjutant of artillery]] of the Territorial army (composed of men aged 34–49 years, considered too old and not enough trained to integrate an active frontline regiment nor reserve). He was assigned to the 23rd Battery of the [[1st Artillery Regiment (France)|1st Artillery Regiment]] and stationed at Fort Cormeilles. On September 25, 1914, his closest younger brother, André Peignot, was killed. The shock was immense for Georges Peignot. He immediately requested&lt;ref&gt;[http://43eric.canalblog.com/archives/2013/11/26/28518848.html « Les Hommes du 43e RIC &gt; 1915 &gt; Septembre 1915 »]&lt;/ref&gt; to be placed on the front in the same regiment as his late brother, the 23rd Colonial Infantry Regiment. In March, he succeeded and was posted on the front line. Everything went fast: May 15, 1915, the youngest of his brothers, Rémy, was killed in the same [[Somme (department)|Somme sector]] of the front. On July 25, Georges Peignot transmitted to his maternal cousin, Henri Menut, his power as manager of the company. September 28, 1915, north of [[Arras]], between [[Souchez]] and [[Givenchy-en-Gohelle|Givenchy]], Georges Peignot was struck by a bullet in the forehead ''« immediately after shouting to his troops: "En avant ! (Forward !)" »,'' as Lucien Peignot reported (the fourth and last brother who will also lose his life June 29, 1916), and who had had time to conduct a long investigation to find his lost brother in the no man's land where he laid for a month.&lt;ref name = "froissart" /&gt; Georges Peignot, buried next to Rémy, is quoted in the order of the Division and awarded the [[1914–1918 War Cross (France)|Military Cross]] and [[Military Medal (France)|Military Medal]].

== Posterity ==
[[Louis Barthou]], former French Prime Minister, wrote in 1916 about Georges Peignot that he was recognized ''« for his active and open mind, impatient of initiatives, for the righteousness of his strong and loyal character, for his simmering and thoughtful passion for the noble art to which he had devoted his life. »''&lt;ref name="barthou2"/&gt;

Georges Lecomte, Director of the [[École Estienne]], said in 1918 about Georges and Lucien: ''« The Peignot brothers had conquered affectionate esteem of all book industry, of printers and publishers, of craftsmen and workers of the profession, of enthusiasts of fine editions, of writers who pay attention to how you print them. »'' They came in 1914 present him the Cochins and he still remembers ''« their tone of serious simplicity and modest satisfaction, (…) their refined but unpretentious friendliness. »''
[[File:Plaque de la rue des Quatre-Frères-Peignot à Paris, février 2008.jpg|thumb|Street sign for "rue des Quatre-Frères-Peignot", in Paris (XVth arrondissement)]]

In 1922, the National "Committee for Education and Fine Arts" proposes to honor the history of Peignot: all the genuine punches of the Foundry and the bronze Gustave Peignot's statue are carried in the building of the [[Imprimerie nationale]], across the Gutenberg street. The Committee proposes that the extension of this street would be called "rue des Quatre-Frères-Peignot" (Four-Brothers-Peignot street) in memory of the four dead brothers.

The typographer [[Maximilien Vox]] acknowledges his debt to Georges Peignot, for whom he was ''« the first French typographer who did not think of his job as confined to supplying the printer with little pieces of metal ».''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Stephen | last= Heller | title = The Man Behind the Face | journal = Print  | volume = March–April | issue = 40 | pages = 61 | date = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundry's posterity is tainted by family maneuvers: after the war, Georges Peignot and four of his other brothers are dead (whose eldest died of illness in 1913); the potential successors are the two girls or the mother. The latter manages in 1919 to impose his surviving children or their widows an 1 million capital increase, given to a competitor, the Deberny foundry, in financial difficulty… which is the property of Jane's husband.&lt;ref name="froissart" /&gt; In 1923, under the pen of Mr. Pascaut, notary, emerges a [[Deberny &amp; Peignot]] company, result of the merger of Deberny (2.6 millions francs capital, 1 million Peignot's family included) and G. Peignot et Fils briefly renamed "Peignot &amp; Cie" (4.1 millions francs). During half a century, Deberny &amp; Peignot will struggle along, riding on its past glory, and goes out in 1974, bloodless, exposed to automatic typographic machines and phototypesetting machines, and a haphazard management.

'''Librestream Technologies Inc.''' is a privately owned, venture capital–backed company based in Winnipeg, Canada. Librestream provides technologies that enable mobile enterprise collaboration.

Librestream is notable in that its technology, consisting of unique hand-held mobile devices and accompanying software, extends traditional video conferencing and collaborative services to places previously unreachable such as an off-shore oil rig or a manufacturing plant floor a continent away.

== Mobile collaboration ==
[[Mobile collaboration]] is a technology-based process of communicating utilizing electronic assets and accompanying software designed for use in remote locations. Newest generation [[Mobile device|hand-held electronic devices]] include video, audio, and telestration (on-screen drawing) capabilities broadcast over secure networks, enabling multi-party conferencing in real time.

Differing from traditional [[videoconferencing|video conferencing]], mobile collaboration utilizes [[wireless]], [[Cellular network|cellular]] and [[broadband]] technologies enabling effective [[collaboration]] independent of location. Where traditional video conferencing has been limited to boardrooms, offices, and lecture theatres, [[recent technological advancements]] have extended the capabilities of video conferencing for use with discreet, hand-held mobile devices, permitting true mobile collaborative possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Company history ==
The origins of Librestream date back to the late 1980s in Winnipeg, Canada, when Kerry Thacher co-founded Ubitrex Corporation, a small high-tech start-up that designed and developed a [[Hospital information system|clinical information system]] for use in hospitals to capture patient data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system included a hand-held device designed for use by clinicians. Subsequent to successful clinical use of this system, Ubitrex was sold in 1994 to U.S-based Continental Healthcare Systems.

Two years later, Thacher bought back the device side of the business from Continental and formed AirWire Mobile Technologies Inc. which continued to support the substantial base of hospitals using the technology. Only a few weeks into AirWire’s operation, [[Symbol Technologies|Symbol Technologies Inc.]], a large U.S-based manufacturer of mobile devices, took notice of AirWire’s unique expertise and contracted with Airwire to create a product to help Symbol pursue the healthcare market.

In 1999, Symbol bought AirWire. Over the next few years, the team, continuing to operate out of Winnipeg, successfully designed and developed a number of mobile devices, one of which delivered [[Voice over IP]] (VoIP), a significant advancement in mobile device technology at that time. This activity led to the development of high-volume hand-held mobile expertise in Winnipeg for the first time, a capability that would later form the foundation for the creation of Librestream.

In August 2003 Thacher left Symbol, and weeks later Symbol closed its Winnipeg office. Although many of the engineers received offers from Symbol to re-locate to New York, all declined.  Later in 2003, a group of eight professionals from the former Winnipeg arm of Symbol gathered to plan their next venture.  In addition to Thacher, this group included Bill Gillanders, Rob McConnell, Don Freiling, Tim Braun, Kent Wotherspoon, Conway Wieler, and Chris Kavanagh.

Two things were clear: the emergence and continued growth of the [[Internet]] was certain, and there existed a tangible opportunity to develop enhanced [[Video|video-handling capabilities]] for a next generation of hand-held devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was convinced that together they could design and develop the necessary technology to allow individuals, regardless of location, the ability to collaborate in new ways. The technology would extend the boundaries of traditional video-conferencing beyond the boardroom to workplaces previously unreachable such as a manufacturing plant floor a continent away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by the founding team’s vision, Librestream (a combination of ‘free’ and stream’) was formed. Backed by venture capital and individual investors, Librestream developed their first alpha product, the MCD-1000, coupled with desktop collaboration software, MCA, in 2006. Eventually the mobile collaborative device evolved into the Onsight 1000, one of multiple rugged hand-held devices in the Onsight product line. The desktop collaboration software evolved into the Onsight Expert application.

In 2006, Librestream formed a marketing partnership with [[Tandberg]], one of the leading video conferencing industry players at that time. The arrangement offered Librestream industry exposure and allowed the breadth and depth of the product to grow in response to evolving requirements. After the arrangement expired in July 2010, Librestream continued to develop the technology and support their growing customer base.

By 2010, Librestream’s customer base grew to include global enterprises, many of them [[Fortune 500]] firms, in industries such as manufacturing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The '''Micro Four Thirds system''' ('''MFT''' or '''M4/3''') is a standard released by [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] and [[Panasonic]] in 2008,&lt;ref name = 'DPReview.com 2008-08-05'&gt;{{cite news | title =Olympus and Panasonic announce Micro Four Thirds | date = 2008-08-05 | work = Digital Photography Review | url = http://www.dpreview.com/news/0808/08080501microfourthirds.asp | accessdate = 2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the design and development of [[mirrorless interchangeable lens digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s and [[Camera lens|lenses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|type=press release |url=http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/prModelDetail?storeId=11301&amp;catalogId=13251&amp;itemId=407080&amp;modelNo=Content04082010101919040&amp;surfModel |title=Panasonic introduces AG-AF100 |publisher=Panasonic |accessdate=2012-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427044852/http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/prModelDetail?storeId=11301&amp;catalogId=13251&amp;itemId=407080&amp;modelNo=Content04082010101919040&amp;surfModel |archivedate=2012-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Camera bodies are available from [[Blackmagic Design|Blackmagic]], [[DJI (company)|DJI]], [[JVC]], [[Kodak]], Olympus, Panasonic, and [[Xiaomi]]. MFT lenses are produced by [[Cosina Voigtländer]], DJI, Kowa, [[Kodak]], Mitakon, Olympus, Panasonic, [[Samyang Optics|Samyang]], [[Sigma Corporation|Sigma]], SLR Magic, [[Tamron]], [[Tokina]], Veydra, and [[Xiaomi]], amongst others.

MFT shares the original [[image sensor]] size and specification with the [[Four Thirds system]], designed for [[digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLR]]s. Unlike Four Thirds, the MFT system design specification does not provide space for a mirror box and a [[pentaprism]], which facilitates smaller body designs and a shorter [[flange focal distance]], and hence smaller lenses. With adapters, most lenses can be used on MFT camera bodies, including those produced by Canon and Nikon, and lenses produced for cinema, ''e.g.'', [[Arri PL|PL mount]] or [[C mount]].

== Comparison with other systems ==
[[File:Olympus-MicroFT-Model.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Concept model of MFT camera by Olympus]]
''For comparison of the original Four Thirds with competing DSLR system see [[Four Thirds system#Advantages, disadvantages and other considerations]]''

Compared to most digital [[compact camera]]s and many [[bridge camera]]s, MFT cameras have better, [[image sensor format|larger sensors]], and interchangeable lenses. They provide far greater control over depth-of-field than compact cameras. There are many lenses available. On top of this, a large number of other lenses (even from the analogue film era) can be fitted using an adapter. Different lenses yield greater creative possibilities. However, Micro Four Thirds cameras also tend to be slightly larger, heavier and more expensive than compact cameras.

Compared to most digital [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|SLRs]], the Micro Four Thirds system (body and lenses) is smaller and lighter. However, their sensors are smaller than [[Image sensor format|full-frame or even APS-C systems]]. As such, they may produce noisier/grainier images in low light conditions when compared with contemporary cameras with larger sensors. Unlike DSLRs, which use an optical viewfinder, Micro Four Thirds cameras use an electronic viewfinder. Resolutions and refresh speeds on these EVF displays were originally compared negatively to optical viewfinders, but today's EVF systems are faster, brighter and much higher resolution than the original displays. Micro Four Thirds cameras always afford a greater depth-of-field than SLRs when shooting at the same focal length and aperture, but it is more difficult to design a wide-aperture lens for Micro Four Thirds. Original Micro Four Thirds cameras used a contrast-detection autofocus system, slower than the phase-detect autofocus that is standard on DSLRs. To this day most Micro Four Thirds cameras continue to use a contrast-based focussing system. Although some current models, such as the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II, feature a hybrid phase-detect/contrast detect system, Panasonic Lumix cameras have continued to use a contrast-based system called DFD (Depth from Defocus). Both systems today provide focussing speeds to rival or even surpass many current DSLRs.

== Sensor size and aspect ratio ==
[[File:Sensor sizes overlaid inside - updated.svg|thumb|right|300px|Drawing showing the relative sizes of sensors used in most current digital cameras, relative to a [[135 film|35mm film]] frame]]
The image sensor of Four Thirds and MFT measures 18&amp;nbsp;mm × 13.5&amp;nbsp;mm (22.5&amp;nbsp;mm diagonal), with an imaging area of 17.3&amp;nbsp;mm × 13.0&amp;nbsp;mm (21.6&amp;nbsp;mm diagonal), comparable to the frame size of [[110 film]].&lt;ref name='Olympus-Europe 4/3'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympus-europa.com/consumer/dslr_7045.htm |title=No more compromises: The Four Thirds Standard |accessdate=2007-11-09 |publisher=Olympus Europe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714235957/http://www.olympus-europa.com/consumer/dslr_7045.htm |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its area, ca. 220&amp;nbsp;mm², is approximately 30% less than the quasi-[[APS-C]] sensors used in other manufacturers' [[DSLR]]s; it is around 9 times larger than the 1/2.3" sensors typically used in [[compact digital camera]]s.

The Four Thirds system uses a 4:3 [[Aspect ratio (image)|image aspect ratio]], like compact digital cameras. In comparison, DSLRs usually adhere to the 3:2 aspect ratio of the traditional [[135 film|35 mm]] format. Thus, "Four Thirds" refers to both the size and the aspect ratio of the sensor.&lt;ref name="Knaur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a-digital-eye.com/Olympus43Q&amp;A.html |last=Knaur |title=Interview |date=October 1, 2002 |work=A Digital Eye |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021205033057/http://www.a-digital-eye.com/Olympus43Q%26A.html |archivedate=December 5, 2002 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the chip diagonal is shorter than 4/3 of an inch; the 4/3&amp;nbsp;inch designation for this size of sensor dates back to the 1950s and [[Video camera tube|vidicon]] tubes, when the external diameter of the camera tube was measured, not the active area.

The MFT design standard also specifies multiple aspect ratios: 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 (the native [[HD video]] format specification), and 1:1 (a square format). With the exception of two MFT cameras,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmcgh1/|title=Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH1 Review|work=Digital Photography Review|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmcgh2/|title=Panasonic DMC-GH2 Review|work=Digital Photography Review|accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; all MFT cameras record in a native 4:3 format image aspect ratio, and through cropping of the 4:3 image, can record in 16:9, 3:2 and 1:1 formats.

In addition, all current Micro Four Thirds cameras have sensor dust removal technologies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Lens mount ==
[[File:Panasonic 14mm mount.jpg|thumb|The lens mount of the Panasonic Lumix G 14mm F2.5 ASPH]]
The MFT system design specifies a bayonet type [[lens mount]] with a [[flange focal distance]] of 19.25&amp;nbsp;mm. By avoiding internal mirrors, the MFT standard allows a much thinner camera body.

=== Viewfinders for a mirrorless camera ===
Viewing is achieved on all models by [[live view]] electronic displays with [[LCD]] screens. In addition, some models feature a built-in [[electronic viewfinder]] (EVF), while others may offer optional detachable electronic viewfinders.
An independent optical [[viewfinder]] typically matched to a particular non-zoom [[prime lens]] is sometimes an option.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Backward compatibility ===
The flange diameter is about 38&amp;nbsp;mm, 6&amp;nbsp;mm less than that of the Four Thirds system. Electrically, MFT uses an 11-contact connector between lens and camera, adding to the nine contacts in the Four Thirds system design specification. Olympus claims full [[backward compatibility]] for many of its existing Four Thirds lenses on MFT bodies, using a purpose built adapter with both mechanical and electrical interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=MFT products|contribution=M adapter|contribution-url=http://www.four-thirds.org/en/microft/mft_product.html#m-adapter|publisher=Four Thirds consortium}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adapters to other lens mounts ===
The shallow but wide MFT lens mount also allows the use of existing lenses including [[Leica M]], [[Leica R bayonet|Leica R]], and [[Olympus OM system]] lenses, via Panasonic and Olympus adapters.  Aftermarket adapters include [[M39 lens mount|Leica Screw Mount]], [[Contax G]], [[C mount]], [[Arri PL]] mount, [[M42 lens mount|Praktica]], Canon, Nikon, and Pentax, amongst others.&lt;ref name="Novoflex"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.novoflex.com/en/products/adapters/adapters-for-microfourthirds-cameras/ |title= Adapters for Micro Four Thirds Cameras |publisher = Novoflex | accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, almost any still camera, movie or video camera interchangeable lens that has a flange focal distance greater than or marginally less than 20&amp;nbsp;mm can often be used on MFT bodies via an adapter.  While MFT cameras can use many of these "legacy" lenses only with manual focus and manual aperture control mode, hundreds of lenses are available, even those designed for cameras no longer in production.

While lens manufacturers seldom publish lens mount specifications, the µ4/3rds mount has been reverse-engineered by enthusiasts, with CAD files available.&lt;ref name="Salvaged Circuitry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salvagedcircuitry.com/u43-mount|title=Micro Four Thirds Mount Technical Drawing and CAD|accessdate=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Autofocus design ==
MFT cameras usually use [[Autofocus#Contrast detection|contrast-detection autofocus]] (CDAF), a common autofocus system for mirrorless [[compact camera|compact or "point-and-shoot"]]. By comparison, DSLRs use [[Autofocus#Phase detection|phase-detection autofocus]] (PDAF). The use of separate PDAF sensors has been favored in DSLR systems because of mirror box and pentaprism design, along with better performance for fast-moving subjects.

The (non-Micro) Four Thirds system design standard specifies a 40&amp;nbsp;mm flange focal length distance, which allowed for using a single lens reflex design, with mirror box and pentaprism. Four Thirds DSLR cameras designed by Olympus and Panasonic initially used exclusively PDAF focusing systems. Olympus then introduced the first live view DSLR camera, which incorporated both traditional DSLR phase focus and also optional contrast detection focus. As a result, newer Four Thirds system lenses were designed both for PDAF and contrast focus. Several of the Four Thirds lenses focus on Micro Four Thirds proficiently when an electrically compatible adapter is used on the Micro Four Thirds cameras, and they focus on Micro Four Thirds cameras much quicker than earlier generation Four Thirds lenses can.

Some MFT cameras, such as the OM-D E-M1 and E-M1 Mark II incorporate phase-detection hardware on the sensor to support legacy lenses. These camera bodies perform better with legacy lenses (eg, focus performance of the 150mm f/2 and 300mm f/2.8 lenses are as quick and accurate as a native Four Thirds body).

== Flange focal distance and crop factor ==
The much shorter [[flange focal distance]] enabled by the removal of the mirror allows normal and wide angle lenses to be significantly smaller because they do not have to use strongly [[retrofocus|retrofocal]] designs.

The Four Thirds sensor format used in MFT cameras is equivalent to a 2.0 [[crop factor]] when compared to a 35&amp;nbsp;mm film (full frame) camera. This means that the field of view of an MFT lens is the same as a full frame lens with twice the focal length. For example, a 50&amp;nbsp;mm lens on a MFT body would have a field of view equivalent to a 100&amp;nbsp;mm lens on a full frame camera. For this reason, MFT lenses can be smaller and lighter because to achieve the equivalent 35&amp;nbsp;mm film camera field of view, the MFT focal length is much shorter. See the table of lenses below to understand the differences better. For comparison, typical DSLR sensors, such as Canon's APS-C sensors, have a crop factor of 1.6.

=== Equivalents ===
{{weaselwords|date=April 2017}}
This section gives a brief introduction to the subject of "equivalence" in photography. Equivalent images are made by photographing the same [[angle of view]], with the same [[depth of field]] and the same [[Angular resolution]] due to [[diffraction]] limitation (which requires different f-stops on different focal length lenses), the same [[motion blur]] (requires the same shutter speed), therefore the ISO setting must differ to compensate for the f-stop difference. The use of this is only to let us compare the effectiveness of the sensors given the same amount of light hitting them. In normal photography with any one camera, equivalence is not necessarily an issue: there are several lenses faster than f/2.4 for Micro Four Thirds (see the tables under Fixed Focal Length Lenses, below), and there are certainly many lenses faster than f/4.8 for full frame and no one hesitates to use them even though they can have shallower depth of field than a Nikon 1 at f/1.7, in fact that can be seen as advantageous, but it has to be taken into consideration that a further aspect of image resolution is limitation by [[optical aberration]], which can be compensated the better the smaller the focal lengths of a lens is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikon.com/about/technology/life/imaging/aberration/index.htm Interchangeable Lenses – Chromatic Aberration Compensation - Essential technologies of lens designs that enhace resolving power], nikon.com, August 2014, retrieved 13. September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Lenses designed for mirrorless camera systems such as Nikon 1 or Micro Four Thirds often use image-space [[telecentric]] lens designs,&lt;ref&gt;Ashton Acton: ''Refractive Errors—Advances in Research and Treatment'', page 40, Scholarly Editions, 2013, {{ISBN|9781481692076}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduce shading and therefore light loss and blurring at the [[microlens]]es of the image sensor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.four-thirds.org/en/microftmerit/merit2.html Why is the Micro Four Thirds sensor so sharp in spite of its small size], four-thirds.org, retrieved 13. September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in low light conditions by using low f-numbers a too-shallow depth of field can lead to less satisfying image results, especially in videography, when the object being filmed by the camera or the camera itself is moving. For those interested in producing equivalent images, read on.

Equivalent [[focal length]]s are given, if the angle of view is identical.&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digitale_bildgebende_Verfahren:_Bildaufnahme#.C3.84quivalente_Brennweite Äquivalente Brennweite], Wikibook ''Digitale bildgebende Verfahren'', Kapitel ''Bildaufnahme'', retrieved 17. Januar 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The depth of field is identical, if angle of view and absolute aperture width are identical. Also the relative diameters of the [[Airy disk]]s representing the limitation by diffraction are identical. Therefore, the equivalent [[f-number]]s are varying.&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digitale_bildgebende_Verfahren:_Bildaufnahme#.C3.84quivalente_Blendenzahl Äquivalente Blendenzahl], Wikibook ''Digitale bildgebende Verfahren'', Kapitel ''Bildaufnahme'', retrieved 17. Januar 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, i.e., with the same [[luminous flux]] within the lens, the [[illuminance]] quadracially decreases and the [[luminous intensity]] quadratically increases with the image size. Therefore, all systems detect the same [[luminance]]s and the same [[exposure value]]s in the [[image plane]], and as a consequence of this the equivalent [[exposure index]]es (respectively equivalent ISO speeds) are different in order to get the identical [[shutter speed]]s (i.e., exposure times) with the same levels of [[motion blur]] and [[image stabilisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Digitale_bildgebende_Verfahren:_Bildaufnahme#.C3.84quivalente_Lichtempfindlichkeit Äquivalente Lichtempfindlichkeit], Wikibook ''Digitale bildgebende Verfahren'', Kapitel ''Bildaufnahme'', retrieved 17. Januar 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, for a given [[guide number]] of a [[Flash (photography)|photoflash device]] all systems have the same exposure at the same flash-to-subject distance.

The following table exemplarily shows a few identical image parameters for some popular image sensor classes compared to Micro Four Thirds:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpreview.com/articles/2666934640/what-is-equivalence-and-why-should-i-care What is equivalence and why should I care?], dpreview.com, 7 July 2014, retrieved 17. January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller the focal length, the smaller is also the displacement in the image space between the last [[principal plane]] of the lens and the image sensor in order to focus a certain object. Therefore, the energy needed for focussing as well as the appropriate delay for shifting the focussing lens system are shorter, the smaller the focal length is.

=== Advantages of Micro Four Thirds over DSLR cameras ===
[[File:Panasonic Lumix GM1.jpg|thumbnail|Smallest mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, [[Panasonic GM1]] side by side with [[AA battery]].]]
Micro Four Thirds has several advantages over larger format cameras and lenses:
* Smaller and lighter
* The shorter [[flange focal distance]] means that most manual lenses can be adapted for use, though [[C-mount]] lenses have a slightly shorter flange focal distance and are trickier to adapt.
* The shorter flange focal distance may also allow for smaller, lighter and lower cost lenses. This is especially true for wide angle lenses.
* Forward or back focus does not occur with contrast focus like it can when using DSLR [[Autofocus#Phase detection|phase focus]], and likewise each lens does not have to be individually calibrated to each camera, which can be required for DSLRs to have accurate focus.
* The absence of a mirror eliminates the need for an additional precision assembly, along with its "mirror slap" noise and resultant camera vibration/movement.
* Viewfinders can be used when filming videos.
* In continuous mode (video takes or sequential shots) the smaller sensor can be cooled better to avoid the increase of image noise.
* The autofocus performance is the same for stills and videos, so the speed is much faster than conventional DSLRs in video mode.
* Because of the reduced sensor-flange distance, the sensor is easier to clean than with a DSLR, which also have delicate mirror mechanisms attached.
* The smaller sensor size may allow for smaller and lighter telephoto-lens equivalents.
* Smaller and lighter cameras and lenses allow discretion and portability.
* The smaller sensor size gives deeper depth-of-field for the same equivalent field of view and aperture. This can be desirable in some situations, such as landscape and macro shooting.

===Advantages of the electronic viewfinder===
[[File:EVF Panasonic Lumix DMC-G80.jpg|thumb|2.36M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder of [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-G80]]]]
Though many DSLRs also have "live view" functionality, these function relatively poorly compared to a Micro Four Thirds [[electronic viewfinder]] (EVF), which has the following advantages:
* Real-time preview of exposure, white balance, and tone.
* Can show a low-light scene brighter than it is.
* The viewfinder can zoom into one's preview, which a mirror-based viewfinder cannot do. This is why using manual focus through a zoomed EVF is more precise than manual focus through a mirror.
* The viewfinder displays how the sensor sees the potential picture, rather than an optical view, which may differ.
* The view can appear larger than some optical viewfinders, which often have a tunnel-like view.
* Not reliant on a moving mirror and shutter, which otherwise adds noise, weight, design complexity, and cost.
* No weight or size penalty for better quality of materials and design. Optical viewfinder quality varies greatly across all DSLRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Optical Viewfinders (OVFs) vs. Electronic Viewfinders (EVFs)|url= http://www.discoverdigitalphotography.com/2012/optical-viewfinders-ovfs-vs-electronic-viewfinders-evfs/ |website=Discover Digital Photography | accessdate =19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olympus and Panasonic approached the implementation of electronic viewfinders in two ways: the built-in EVF, and the optional [[hotshoe]] add-on EVF.

Until the introduction of the OM-D E-M5 in February, 2012, none of the Olympus designs included a built-in EVF. Olympus has four available add-on hotshoe viewfinders.  The Olympus VF-1 is an optical viewfinder with an angle of view of 65 degrees, equivalent to the 17mm pancake lens field of view, and was designed primarily for the EP-1.  Olympus has since introduced the high resolution VF-2 EVF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.olympusamerica.com/presspass/press_pass_cut/opp_press_details.asp?pressNo=757 |title=Olympus Press Pass: Press Release |publisher=Olympus America | accessdate= 2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a newer, less expensive, slightly lower resolution VF-3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Olympus America CCS Department |url=http://www.olympusamerica.com/oai_HeadlinesDetails.asp?pressNo=860 |title = Swing Into Action! Olympus Unleashes The Highly Anticipated PEN E-PL3 Camera Featuring Tilting LCD And The New VF-3 Electronic Viewfinder | date =2011-07-27 |accessdate= 2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use in all its MFT cameras after the [[Olympus EP-1]].  These EVF's not only slip into the accessory hotshoe, but also plug into a dedicated proprietary port for power and communication with Olympus cameras only.  Both the VF-2 and VF-3 may also be used on high-end Olympus compact point and shoot cameras such as the [[Olympus XZ-1]].  Olympus announced the VF-4 in May 2013, along with the fourth generation PEN flagship, the E-P5.

As of mid-2011, Panasonic G and GH series cameras have built in EVF's, while two of the three GF models are able to use the add-on LVF1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/prModelDetail?storeId=11301&amp;catalogId=13251&amp;itemId=371044&amp;modelNo=Content09012009063419862&amp;surfModel=Content09012009063419862 | publisher = Panasonic USA | title = Pressroom | accessdate = 2012-05-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120318021110/http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/prModelDetail?storeId=11301&amp;catalogId=13251&amp;itemId=371044&amp;modelNo=Content09012009063419862&amp;surfModel=Content09012009063419862 | archivedate = 2012-03-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; hotshoe EVF.  The LVF1 must also plug into a proprietary port built into the camera for power and communication.  This proprietary port and the accessory is omitted in the [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3]] design.  Similar to Olympus, the LVF1 is usable on high-end Panasonic compact point and shoot cameras, such as the [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5]].

=== Disadvantages of Micro Four Thirds compared to DSLRs ===

[[File:Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX85.jpg|thumb|Rangefinder-styled Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX80/DMC-GX85/GX7 Mark II (2016)]]
* The sensor is 40% or 50% smaller in area (2.0× crop factor) than the smaller-than-APS-C (1.5× crop factor, or 1.6x for Canon APS-C) sized sensors common in other systems, and 75% smaller (i.e. a quarter of the area) than a full frame sensor (1.0× crop factor)  (35&amp;nbsp;mm equivalent), which can mean lower image quality when all other variables are the same. This might include poorer color transitions and more noise at identical ISO settings, especially in low light, when compared with the larger sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Northrup | first = Tony| title= Photography Buying Guide: How to Choose a Camera, Lens, Tripod, Flash &amp; More|date=2013|publisher = Mason Press|location=Waterford, CT|isbn=0-98826342-4|page=52|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qoCaBQAAQBAJ |accessdate= 27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contrast detect autofocus systems such as those used in Micro Four Thirds cameras were initially slower than the phase detect systems used in advanced DSLRs.  This gap was eliminated with the [[Olympus OM-D E-M5]] when shooting static subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Olympus E-M5 | newspaper = Digital photography review | url = http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympusem5/11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tracking of subjects moving towards or away from the camera was also difficult with contrast detection, however this issue was eliminated in 2013 with the introduction of the [[Olympus OM-D E-M1]]'s hybrid phase detection auto-focus system.
* Due to the absence of a mirror and prism mechanism, there is no ability to use a through-the-lens optical viewfinder. A through-the-lens electronic viewfinder, an attachable not-through-the-lens optical viewfinder (similar to a [[Rangefinder camera|rangefinder]] or [[Twin-lens reflex camera|TLR]]), or the universally supplied LCD screen must be used instead.
* Theoretically, changing lenses can expose the sensor to more dust in a "mirrorless" camera design, compared to DSLRs that have both a mirror and a closed shutter protecting the sensor.  Mirrorless cameras have dust-removal systems that try to minimize this problem, and in practice they experience fewer dust problems than a DSLR.&lt;ref name=mansurov&gt;{{cite web|last =Mansurov|first = Nasim | title = Mirrorless vs DSLR|url= https://photographylife.com/mirrorless-vs-dslr |website=Photography Life|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many micro-four third users report never having found dust on the sensor at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Hicks|first =Laura | title =Migrating to Mirrorless: Death of the DSLR|url= http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/default.asp?newsID=5479&amp;news=migration+to+mirrorless+ditching+the+DSLR+Olympus+Sony+Fuji |website=Digital Camera Review|accessdate= 19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A larger crop factor (2× multiplier versus quasi-APS-C's 1.5× ) means greater [[Depth of field|depth-of-field]] for the same equivalent field of view and f/stop when compared with quasi-APS-C and especially full frame cameras. This can be a disadvantage when a photographer wants to blur a background, such as when shooting portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.getolympus.com/us/en/m-zuiko-digital-ed-45mm-f1-8.html | publisher = Olympus | title = M-Zuiko Digital ED 45mm f/1.8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Micro Four Thirds cameras are smaller than DSLRs or quasi-APS-C cameras, and this can result in relatively poor ergonomics for bigger-handed users, while it benefits most others. This applies especially to handling, the depth of the right-hand grip, and the size and placement of buttons and dials.
* Micro Four Thirds lenses cannot be used on 35mm equivalent and APS-C cameras due to lens [[vignetting]].

=== Advantages of Micro Four Thirds over compact digital cameras ===
* Greatly increased sensor size (5–9 times larger area) gives much better image quality, e.g.  low light performance and greater dynamic range, with reduced [[Image noise|noise]].
* Interchangeable lenses allow more optical choices including niche, legacy, and future lenses.
* Shallower depth of field possible (e.g. for portraits, for [[bokeh]] ... ).

=== Disadvantages of Micro Four Thirds compared to compact digital cameras ===
* Increased physical size (camera and lenses are both larger due to increased sensor size);
* [[Superzoom|Extreme zoom]] lenses available on compacts (such as 10×-30× models) are more expensive or simply not available on large sensor cameras due to physical size, cost, and practicality considerations;
* Similarly, larger sensors and shallow depth-of-field make bundled [[Macro lens|macro]] capability and close focusing more difficult, often requiring separate, specialized lenses.
* Higher cost.

=== Popularity with adapted/legacy lenses ===
[[File:Olympus PEN E-PL2 with OM Zuiko 50mm 1.8.jpg|thumb|Olympus PEN E-PL2 with a legacy lens OM Zuiko 50mm f/1.8]][[File:TZ5 pics (2)edited.jpg|thumb|Panasonic Lumix GF1 with K mount adapter and Cambron 28mm manual lens]]
Due to the short native flange distance of the Micro Four Thirds System, the usage of adapted lenses from practically all formats has become widely popular.  Because lenses can be used from old and abandoned camera systems, adapted lenses typically represent good value for the money.  Adapters ranging from low- to high-quality are readily available for purchase online.  Canon FD, Nikon F (G lenses require special adapters), MD/MC, Leica M, M42 Screw Mount, and C-mount Cine lenses to name a few are all easily adaptable to the Micro Four Thirds system with glassless adapters resulting in no induced loss of light or sharpness.

Adapted lenses retain their native focal lengths but [[field of view]] is reduced by half —i.e., an adapted 50mm lens is still a 50mm lens in terms of focal length but has a narrower FOV equivalent to a 100mm lens due to the Micro Four Thirds System 2x crop factor. Therefore, most adapted glass from the 35mm film era and current DSLR lineups provide effective fields of view varying from normal to extreme telephoto. Wide angles are generally not practical for adapted use from both an image quality and value point of view.

Using older adapted lenses on micro four thirds sometimes leads to a slight losses in image quality.  This is the result of placing high resolution demands on the center crop of decade old 35mm lenses.  Therefore, 100% crops from the lenses do not usually represent the same level of pixel-level sharpness as they would on their native formats.  Another slight disadvantage of using adapted lenses can be size.  By using a 35mm film lens, one would be using a lens that casts an image circle that is far larger than what is required by Micro Four Thirds Sensors.

The main disadvantage of using adapted lenses however, is that focus is manual even with natively autofocus lenses.  Full metering functionality is maintained however, as are some automated shooting modes (aperture priority).  A further disadvantage with some LM and LTM lenses is that lenses with significant rear protrusions simply do not fit inside the camera body and risk damaging lens or body.  An example is the [[Zeiss Biogon|Biogon type]] of lens.

Overall, the ability to use adapted lenses gives Micro Four Thirds a great advantage in overall versatility and the practice has gained a somewhat cult following. Image samples can be found readily online, and in particular on the MU-43 adapted lenses forum.

The first Micro Four Thirds system camera was [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1]], which was launched in Japan in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicdmcg1/| title = Panasonic Lumix G1 reviewed | publisher = Digital Photography Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2009, [[Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH1]] with [[High-definition video|HD video]] recording added to it.&lt;ref name = "Panasonic premieres DMC-GH1 with HD video recording"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dpreview.com/news/0903/09030315panasoniclumixdmcgh1.asp | title= Panasonic premieres DMC-GH1 with HD video recording| date= 2009-03-03 | publisher = Digital Photography Review |accessdate = 2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] model, the [[Olympus PEN E-P1]], was shipped in July 2009.

In August 2013 SVS Vistek GmbH in Seefeld, Germany introduced the first high-speed industrial MFT lens mount camera using 4/3" sensors from Truesense Imaging, Inc (formally Kodak sensors), now part of [[ON Semiconductor]]. Their Evo "Tracer" cameras range from 1 megapixels at 147 frames per second (fps) to 8 megapixels at 22 fps.

In 2014, JK Imaging Ltd., which holds the Kodak brand, released its first Micro Four Thirds camera, the [[Kodak Pixpro S-1]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dpreview.com/previews/kodak-pixpro-s-1/ | title = Kodak Pixpro S-1 First Impressions Review | work = Digital Photography Review | first =Andy | last = Westlake | accessdate = September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; several lenses and niche camera makers have products made for the standard. In 2015, [[DJI (company)|DJI]] provided its drone with optional MFT cameras. Both cameras can capture 16MP stills and up to 4K/30fps video with an option of 4 interchangeable lenses ranging from 12mm to 17mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/09/10/dji-unveils-worlds-first-commercial-aerial-micro-four-thirds-ca/ |title=DJI unveils custom aerial Micro Four Thirds camera |author=Andrew Tarantola |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Xiaomi]] introduced the YI M1, a 20MP MFT camera with 4K video capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xiaoyi.com/weidan.html|title=小蚁微单相机M1|website=www.xiaoyi.com|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{weaselwords|date=April 2017}}
Because the [[flange focal distance]] of Micro Four Thirds cameras are shorter than DSLRs, most lenses are smaller and cheaper.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Of particular interest in illustrating this fact are the Panasonic 7–14&amp;nbsp;mm ultra-wide angle (equivalent to 14–28&amp;nbsp;mm in the 35&amp;nbsp;mm film format) and the Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 9–18&amp;nbsp;mm ultra wide-angle lens (equivalent to an 18–36&amp;nbsp;mm zoom lens in the 35&amp;nbsp;mm film format). This feature also permitted the lens designers to develop the world's fastest fisheye lens with autofocus, the [[Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 8 mm f/1.8 Fisheye Pro|Olympus ED 8 mm f/1.8]].

On the telephoto end, the Panasonic 100–300&amp;nbsp;mm or the [[Panasonic Leica DG Vario-Elmar 100-400 mm|Leica DG 100-400&amp;nbsp;mm]] as well as the Olympus 75–300&amp;nbsp;mm zooms show how small and light extreme telephotos can be made. The 400&amp;nbsp;mm focal length in Micro Four Thirds has the same angle of view as a 800&amp;nbsp;mm focal length in full frame cameras.

When compared to a full frame camera lens providing a similar angle of view, rather than weighing a few kilograms (several pounds) and generally having a length of over 60&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;ft) end to end, the optically stabilized Panasonic Lumix G Vario 100–300&amp;nbsp;mm lens weighs just 520 grams (18.3&amp;nbsp;oz), is only 126&amp;nbsp;mm (5.0&amp;nbsp;in) long, and uses a relatively petite 67&amp;nbsp;mm filter size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://panasonic.net/avc/lumix/systemcamera/gms/lens/g_vario_100_300.html | title =Digital Interchangeable Lenses | work = Lumix Digital Camera | publisher =Panasonic | accessdate= 2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a point of comparison, the Nikon 600&amp;nbsp;mm f5.6 telephoto weighs 3600 grams (7.9&amp;nbsp;lb), is 516.5&amp;nbsp;mm (20.3&amp;nbsp;in) in length and uses a custom 122&amp;nbsp;mm filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/companies/nikon/nikkoresources/6070nikkor/telephoto/600mm.htm | title = 600 mm f5.6 Nikkor-P Auto Telephoto Lens |publisher= Mir | place = [[Malaysia|MY]] | accessdate= 2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Image stabilization approaches===
Olympus and Panasonic have both produced cameras with sensor-based stabilization, and lenses with stabilization. However, the lens stabilization will only work together with body stabilization for cameras of the same brand. Before 2013, Olympus and Panasonic approached [[image stabilization]] (IS) differently. Olympus used [[Image stabilization#Sensor-shift|sensor-shift]] image stabilization only, which it calls IBIS ('''I'''n-'''B'''ody '''I'''mage '''S'''tabilization), a feature included all of its cameras. Until 2013, Panasonic used [[Image stabilization#Lens-based|lens-based]] stabilization only, called Mega OIS or Power OIS. These stabilize the image by shifting a small optical block within the lens.

[[File:Leica.DG.Vario-Elmar.100-400.jpg|thumb|[[Panasonic Leica DG Vario-Elmar 100-400 mm|Telephoto zoom lens Leica DG 100-400 mm]]]]

In 2013, Panasonic began including sensor-based stabilization in its cameras, beginning with the Lumix DMC-GX7. Panasonic called the combination of lens and body stabilization "Dual IS," and this function won an award of the European Imaging and Sound Association (EISA) in the category Photo Innovation 2016-2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eisa.eu/awards/photography.html#awards EISA Awards Photography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027224025/https://www.eisa.eu/awards/photography.html |date=2016-10-27 }}, eisa.eu, retrieved 12 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Olympus added lens-based stabilization to the M. Zuiko 300mm f/4.0 Pro telephoto prime lens and the M. Zuiko 12-100mm f/4.0 IS Pro lens.

Panasonic claims that OIS is more accurate because the stabilization system can be designed for the particular optical characteristics of each lens. A disadvantage of this approach is that the OIS motor and shift mechanism must be built into each lens, making lenses more expensive than comparable non-OIS lenses. Of all Panasonic lenses only few with short focal lengths, and therefore wide angles of view and low susceptibility to image shaking, are not image stabilized, including the 8&amp;nbsp;mm fisheye, 7–14&amp;nbsp;mm wide angle zoom, 14&amp;nbsp;mm prime, the 15&amp;nbsp;mm prime, and the 20&amp;nbsp;mm prime.

The advantage of in-body IS is that even unstabilized lenses can make use of the in-body stabilization.

;Lens compactness and mount adaptability
Since most Micro Four Thirds lenses have neither a mechanical focusing ring nor an aperture ring, adapting these lenses for other camera mounts is impossible or compromised. A variety of companies manufacture adapters to use lenses from nearly any legacy lens mount&lt;ref name="Novoflex"/&gt; (such lenses, of course, support no automatic functions.) For the Four Third lenses that can be mounted on MFT bodies, see [[Four Thirds system|Four Thirds system lenses]]. For the Four Third lenses that support AF, see the Olympus website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympusamerica.com/files/oima_cckb/FT-MFT_Lens_Adapter_Compatibility_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  For those that support fast AF ([[Imager AF]]), see the Olympus website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympusamerica.com/files/oima_cckb/Imager_AF_Compatibility_Statement_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1204">'''NFPA 70B''' (''Recommended Practice for Electrical Equipment Maintenance'') is a standard of the [[National Fire Protection Association]] that addresses recommended electrical equipment maintenance.
NFPA 70B is part of [[NFPA 70]].

==Purpose==

This recommended practice applies to preventive maintenance for electrical, electronic, and communication systems and equipment and is not intended to duplicate or supersede instructions that manufacturers normally provide. Systems and equipment covered are typical of those installed in industrial plants, institutional and commercial buildings, and large multifamily residential complexes.

'''Nitrocellulose''' (also known as '''cellulose nitrate''', '''flash paper''', '''flash cotton''', '''guncotton''', and '''flash string''') is a highly flammable compound formed by [[nitration|nitrating]] [[cellulose]] through exposure to [[nitric acid]] or another powerful nitrating agent. When used as a [[propellant]] or [[Explosive material#Low explosives|low-order explosive]], it was originally known as guncotton.

Partially nitrated cellulose has found uses as a plastic film and in inks and wood coatings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dow.com/dowwolff/en/industrial_solutions/polymers/nitrocellulose | publisher = Dow Chemical | title = Nitrocellulose}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, the [[plastic#History|first man-made plastic]], nitrocellulose (branded [[Parkesine]]), was created by [[Alexander Parkes]] from cellulose treated with nitric acid and a solvent. In 1868, American inventor [[John Wesley Hyatt]] developed a plastic material he named [[Celluloid]], improving on Parkes' invention by plasticizing the nitrocellulose with [[camphor]] so it could be processed into finished form and used as a [[photographic film]]. Celluloid was used by [[Kodak]], and other suppliers, from the late 1880s as a [[film base]] in photography, X-ray films, and motion-picture films, and was known as [[#Nitrate film|nitrate film]]. After numerous fires caused by unstable nitrate films, "safety film" ([[cellulose acetate film]]) started to be used from the 1930s in the case of X-ray stock and from 1948 for motion-picture film.

[[Henri Braconnot]] discovered in 1832 that nitric acid, when combined with starch or wood fibers, would produce a lightweight combustible [[explosive]] material, which he named ''xyloïdine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Henri | last = Braconnot | authorlink = Henri Braconnot | date = 1833 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X5c5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA290#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = De la transformation de plusieurs substances végétales en un principe nouveau | trans-title= On the transformation of several vegetable substances into a new substance | journal = Annales de Chimie et de Physique | volume = 52 | pages = 290–294 | quote = On page 293, Braconnot names nitrocellulose ''xyloïdine''}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later in 1838, another French chemist, [[Théophile-Jules Pelouze]] (teacher of [[Ascanio Sobrero]] and [[Alfred Nobel]]), treated paper and cardboard in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Théophile-Jules|last=Pelouze|authorlink=Théophile-Jules Pelouze|date=1838|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k29662/f713.image.langEN|title=Sur les produits de l'action de l'acide nitrique concentré sur l'amidon et le ligneux|trans-title=On the products of the action of concentrated nitric acid on starch and wood|journal=Comptes Rendus|volume=7|pages=713–715}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] obtained a similar material, which he called ''nitramidine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jean-Baptiste|last=Dumas|authorlink=Jean-Baptiste Dumas|title=Traité de Chimie Appliquée aux Arts|location=Paris|publisher=Bechet Jeune|date=1843|volume=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEo1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=90|quote=''Il y a quelques années, M. Braconnot reconnut que l'acide nitrique concentré, convertit l'amidon, le ligneux, la cellulose, et quelques autres substances en un matière qu'il nomma xyloïdine, et que j'appellerai nitramidine.'' [Some years ago, Mr. Braconnot recognized that concentrated nitric acid converted starch, wood, cellulose, and some other substances into a material that he called xyloïdine, and that I will call nitramidine.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These substances were highly unstable and were not practical explosives.

However, around 1846 [[Christian Friedrich Schönbein]], a German-Swiss chemist, discovered a more practical solution.&lt;ref&gt;Schönbein first communicated his discovery to the [[:de:Naturforschende Gesellschaft in Basel|Naturforschende Gesellschaft]] of [[Basel]], Switzerland on March 11, 1846:
* {{cite journal|last=Schönbein|first=Christian Friedrich|authorlink=Christian Friedrich Schönbein|date=1846-03-11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TSVJAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Notiz über eine Veränderung der Pflanzenfaser und einiger andern organischen Substanzen|trans-title=Notice on a change of plant fibers and some other organic substances|journal=Bericht über die Verhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Basel|volume=7|pages=26–27}}

In a letter, he subsequently communicated his discovery to the [[French Academy of Sciences]]:
* {{cite journal|last=Schönbein|first=Christian Friedrich|authorlink=Christian Friedrich Schönbein|date=1846|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2980r/f682.image.langEN|title=Lettre de M. Schoenbein à M. Dumas|journal=Comptes Rendus|volume=23|pages=678–679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he was working in the kitchen of his home in [[Basel]], he spilled a mixture of [[nitric acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) on the kitchen table. He reached for the nearest cloth, a cotton apron, and wiped it up. He hung the apron on the stove door to dry, and as soon as it was dry, a flash occurred as the apron ignited. His preparation method was the first to be widely imitated—one part of fine [[cotton]] wool to be immersed in 15 parts of an equal blend of [[Sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]]s. After two minutes, the cotton was removed and washed in cold water to set the [[esterification]] level and remove all acid residue. It was then slowly dried at a temperature below 40°C (about 100°F). Schönbein collaborated with the Frankfurt professor [[Rudolf Christian Böttger]], who had discovered the process independently in the same year. By coincidence, a third chemist, the [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] professor F. J. Otto had also produced guncotton in 1846 and was the first to publish the process, much to the disappointment of Schönbein and Böttger.&lt;ref&gt;''Itzehoer Wochenblatt'', 29 October 1846, col. 1626ff.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The process uses nitric acid to convert cellulose into cellulose nitrate and water:
:3&amp;nbsp;HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+ C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; {{Overset|[[proton|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[sulfate|SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]|→}} C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + 3&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The sulfuric acid is present as a [[catalyst]] to produce the [[nitronium ion]], {{chem|NO|2|+}}. The [[Rate equation#First order reactions|reaction is first order]] and proceeds by [[electrophilic substitution]] at the C−OH centers of the cellulose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urbanski|first=Tadeusz|title=Chemistry and Technology of Explosives|publisher=Pergamon Press|location=Oxford|date=1965|volume=1|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nitrocellulose hexanitrate.jpg|thumb|Pure nitrocellulose.]]

Guncotton is made by treating cotton (used as the source of cellulose) with concentrated sulfuric acid and 70% nitric acid{{clarify|reason=what proportions of each are required?|date=April 2015}} cooled to 0°C to produce cellulose trinitrate. While guncotton is dangerous to store, the hazards it presents can be reduced by storing it dampened with various liquids, such as alcohol. For this reason, accounts of guncotton usage dating from the early 20th century refer to "wet guncotton".

The power of guncotton made it suitable for blasting. As a projectile driver, it had around six times the gas generation of an equal volume of [[black powder]] and produced less smoke and less heating.

The patent rights for the manufacture of guncotton were obtained by John Hall &amp; Son in 1846, and industrial manufacture of the explosive began at a purpose-built factory at [[Faversham explosives industry|Marsh Works]] in [[Faversham, Kent]], a year later. However, the manufacturing process was not properly understood and  few safety measures were put in place. A serious explosion in July of that year killed almost two dozen workers, resulting in the immediate closure of the plant. Guncotton manufacture ceased for over 15 years until a safer procedure could be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGEGzWqfAtgC|title=Gunpowder: An Explosive History&amp;nbsp;– from the Alchemists of China to the Battlefields of Europe|first=Clive|last=Ponting|year=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781448128112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research indicated the importance of very careful washing of the acidified cotton. Unwashed nitrocellulose (sometimes called pyrocellulose) may spontaneously ignite and explode at [[room temperature]], as the evaporation of water results in the concentration of unreacted acid.&lt;ref name="naval"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fairfield|first1=A.&amp;nbsp;P.|author2=CDR&amp;nbsp;USN|title=Naval Ordnance|publisher=Lord Baltimore Press|date=1921|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British chemist [[Frederick Augustus Abel]] developed the first safe process for guncotton manufacture, which he patented in 1865. The washing and drying times of the nitrocellulose were both extended to 48 hours and repeated eight times over. The acid mixture was changed to two parts [[sulfuric acid]] to one part nitric. [[Nitration]] can be controlled by adjusting acid concentrations and reaction temperature. Nitrocellulose is soluble in a mixture of [[alcohol]] and ether until nitrogen concentration exceeds 12%. Soluble nitrocellulose, or a solution thereof, is sometimes called [[collodion]].&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=G.&amp;nbsp;I.|date=1998|title=The Big Bang: A History of Explosives|publisher=Sutton Publishing|page=132|isbn=978-0-7509-1878-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Powder Samples.jpg|thumb|left|Various types of [[smokeless powder]], consisting primarily of nitrocellulose]]
Guncotton containing more than 13% nitrogen (sometimes called insoluble nitrocellulose) was prepared by prolonged exposure to hot, concentrated acids&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; for limited use as a blasting explosive or for [[warhead]]s of underwater weapons such as [[naval mine]]s and [[torpedo]]es.&lt;ref name="naval"/&gt; Safe and sustained production of guncotton began at the [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills]] in the 1860s, and the material rapidly became the dominant explosive, becoming the standard for military warheads, although it remained too potent to be used as a propellant. More-stable and slower-burning collodion mixtures were eventually prepared using less-concentrated acids at lower temperatures for [[smokeless powder]] in [[firearm]]s. The first practical smokeless powder made from nitrocellulose, for firearms and artillery ammunition, was invented by French chemist [[Paul Vieille]] in 1884.

[[Jules Verne]] viewed the development of guncotton with optimism. He referred to the substance several times in his novels. His adventurers carried firearms employing this substance. The most noteworthy reference is in his ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'', in which guncotton was used to launch a projectile into space.

On May 2, 1887, [[Hannibal Goodwin]]  filed a patent for "a photographic pellicle and process of producing same&amp;nbsp;... especially in connection with roller cameras", but the patent was not granted until September 13, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|610861}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, George Eastman had already started production of roll-film using his own process.

Nitrocellulose was used as the first flexible [[film base]], beginning with [[Eastman Kodak]] products in August, 1889. [[Camphor]] is used as a [[plasticizer]] for nitrocellulose film, often called nitrate film. Goodwin's patent was sold to [[Ansco]], which successfully sued Eastman Kodak for infringement of the patent and was awarded $5,000,000 in 1914 to Goodwin Film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Kodak Concern to Make Big Payment to Goodwin Company |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1914/03/27/archives/eastman-co-settles-case-kodak-concern-to-make-big-payment-to.html |quote=A settlement has been reached between the Goodwin Film and Camera Company and the Eastman Kodak Company concerning the suit brought in the Federal District Court by the former for an accounting of the profits derived from the sale of photographic films prepared according to the patent taken out by the late Rev.

The details of it have not been announced, but it is understood to provide for tile payment of a large sum of money by ... |work=[[New York Times]] |date= March 27, 1914 |accessdate=2010-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrate film was used for [[X-ray]] photography for some time, where its flammability hazard was most acute, thus in 1933, became disused for such purposes, along with its uses for motion-picture films in 1951, where it was replaced by [[safety film]] with an acetate base.  Nitrocellulose X-ray film ignition was the cause behind the [[Cleveland Clinic fire of 1929]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], which claimed the lives of 123 people during the fire, and a number who were rescued, but died several days later due to inhalation of the toxic smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brad|last=Clifton|title=The Cleveland Clinic X-Ray Fire of 1929|website=Cleveland Historical|accessdate=2015-04-01|url=http://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EYE Film Institute Netherlands - Nitrate film decay - 3.JPG|thumb|Decayed nitrate film. EYE Film Institute Netherlands]]
The use of nitrocellulose film for motion pictures led to the requirement for fireproof projection rooms with wall coverings made of [[asbestos]]. A training film for projectionists included footage of a controlled ignition of a reel of nitrate film, which continued to burn when fully submerged in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Mark Kermode |last=Kermode |first=Mark |date=May 1, 2012 |title=The Good, the Bad and the Multiplex |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Ar1F5LVhLwcC&amp;pg=PA3 |publisher=Random House |page=3 |isbn=9780099543497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other flammable materials, nitrocellulose does not need air to keep burning, as the material contains sufficient oxygen within its molecular structure. Once burning, it is extremely difficult to extinguish. Immersing burning film in water may not extinguish it, and could actually increase the amount of smoke produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns Health and Safety Executive leaflet/cellulose.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}[http://www.britmovie.co.uk/forums/ask-film-question/24900-flammable-film.html Interesting discussion on NC films.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217045028/http://www.britmovie.co.uk/forums/ask-film-question/24900-flammable-film.html |date=2014-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to public safety precautions, the [[London Underground]] forbade transport of movies on its system until well past the introduction of safety film.

Cinema fires caused by ignition of nitrocellulose [[film stock]] were the cause of the 1926 [[Dromcolliher#Dromcollogher Burning|Dromcolliher cinema tragedy]] in [[County Limerick]] in which 48 people died and the 1929 [[Glen Cinema Disaster|Glen Cinema disaster]] in [[Paisley, Scotland]], which killed 69 children. Today, nitrate film projection is normally highly regulated and requires extensive precautionary measures including extra projectionist health and safety training. Projectors certified to run nitrate films have many precautions, among them the chambering of the feed and takeup reels in thick metal covers with small slits to allow the film to run through. The projector is modified to accommodate several fire extinguishers with nozzles aimed at the film gate. The extinguishers automatically trigger if a piece of flammable fabric placed near the gate starts to burn. While this triggering would likely damage or destroy a significant portion of the projection components, it would prevent a fire which could cause far greater damage. Projection rooms may be required to have automatic metal covers for the projection windows, preventing the spread of fire to the [[auditorium]]. The [[Dryden Theatre]] at the [[George Eastman Museum]] is one of a few theaters in the world that is capable of safely projecting nitrate films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nitrate Film: If It Hasn't Gone Away, It's Still Here!|url=https://protekvaults.com/nitrate-film-if-it-hasnt-gone-away-its-still-here/|website=Pro-Tek Vaults|accessdate=11 March 2016|date=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regularly screens films to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Dryden Theatre|url=https://www.eastman.org/about-dryden-theatre|website=George Eastman Museum|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nitrocellulose was found to gradually decompose, releasing nitric acid and further catalyzing the decomposition (eventually into a flammable powder). Decades later, storage at low temperatures was discovered as a means of delaying these reactions indefinitely. The great majority of films produced during the early 20th century are thought to have been lost either through this accelerating, self-catalyzed disintegration or through studio warehouse fires. Salvaging old films is a major problem for film archivists (see [[film preservation]]).

Nitrocellulose film base manufactured by Kodak can be identified by the presence of the word 'nitrate' in dark letters along one edge; the word only in clear letters on a dark background indicates derivation from a nitrate base original negative or projection print, but the film in hand itself may be a later print or copy negative, made on safety film. [[Cellulose acetate film|Acetate film]] manufactured during the era when nitrate films were still in use was marked 'Safety' or 'Safety Film' along one edge in dark letters. [[8 mm film|8]], [[9.5 mm film|9.5]], and [[16 mm film|16&amp;nbsp;mm film]] stocks, intended for amateur and other nontheatrical use, were never manufactured with a nitrate base in the west, but rumors exist of 16&amp;nbsp;mm nitrate film having been produced in the former Soviet Union and/or China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Cleveland|contribution=Don't Try This at Home: Some Thoughts on Nitrate Film, With Particular Reference to Home Movie Systems|editor1-first=Roger|editor1-last=Smither|editor2-first=Catherine|editor2-last=Surowiec|title=This Film is Dangerous: A Celebration of Nitrate Film|location=Brussels|publisher=FIAF|date=2002|isbn=978-2-9600296-0-4|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellulose is treated with sulfuric acid and [[potassium nitrate]] to give cellulose mononitrate. This was used commercially as 'celluloid', a highly flammable plastic used in the first half of the 20th century for lacquers and photographic film. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Nitrate dominated the market for professional-use 35&amp;nbsp;mm motion picture film from the industry's origins to the early 1950s.  While cellulose acetate-based so-called "safety film", notably cellulose diacetate and cellulose acetate propionate, was produced in the gauge for small-scale use in niche applications (such as printing advertisements and other short films to enable them to be sent through the mails without the need for fire safety precautions), the early generations of safety film base had two major disadvantages relative to nitrate: it was much more expensive to manufacture, and considerably less durable in repeated projection.  The cost of the safety precautions associated with the use of nitrate was significantly lower than the cost of using any of the safety bases available before 1948.  These drawbacks were eventually overcome with the launch of [[cellulose triacetate]] base film by Eastman Kodak in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Charles|last=Fordyce|displayauthors=etal|title=Improved Safety Motion Picture Film Support|journal=Journal of the SMPE|volume=51|issue=4|date=Oct 1948|pages=331–350|doi=10.5594/j11731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulose triacetate superseded nitrate as the film industry's mainstay base very quickly. While Kodak had discontinued some nitrate film stocks earlier, they stopped producing various nitrate roll films in 1950 and ceased production of nitrate 35&amp;nbsp;mm motion picture film in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shanebrook|first1=Robert L.|title=Making Kodak Film|date=2016|publisher=Robert L. Shanebrook|location=Rochester, NY|isbn=978-0-615-41825-4|page=82|edition=Expanded 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crucial advantage cellulose triacetate had over nitrate was that it was no more of a fire risk than paper (the stock is often referred to as "non-flam": this is true—but it is combustible, just not in as volatile or as dangerous a way as nitrate), while it almost matched the cost and durability of nitrate.  It remained in almost exclusive use in all film gauges until the 1980s, when [[polyester]]/[[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] film began to supersede it for intermediate and release printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=George J.|last=Van Schil|title=The Use of Polyester Film Base in the Motion Picture Industry|journal=SMPTE Journal|volume=89|issue=2|date=Feb 1980|pages=106–110|doi=10.5594/j00526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyester is much more resistant to [[polymer degradation]] than either nitrate or triacetate.  Although triacetate does not decompose in as dangerous a way as nitrate does, it is still subject to a process known as deacetylation, often nicknamed "vinegar syndrome" (due to the [[acetic acid]] smell of decomposing film) by archivists, which causes the film to shrink, deform, become brittle and eventually unusable. PET, like cellulose mononitrate, is less prone to stretching than other available plastics.  By the late 1990s, polyester had almost entirely superseded triacetate for the production of intermediate elements and release prints.{{citation needed|date = September 2012}}

Triacetate remains in use for most camera negative stocks because it can be "invisibly" spliced using solvents during negative assembly, while polyester film can only be spliced using adhesive tape patches or ultrasonically, both of which leave visible marks in the frame area.  Also, polyester film is so strong, it will not break under tension and may cause serious damage to expensive camera or projector mechanisms in the event of a film jam, whereas triacetate film breaks easily, reducing the risk of damage. Many were opposed to the use of polyester for release prints for precisely this reason, and because ultrasonic splicers are very expensive items, beyond the budgets of many smaller theaters.  In practice, though, this has not proved to be as much of a problem as was feared. Rather, with the increased use of automated long-play systems in cinemas, the greater strength of polyester has been a significant advantage in lessening the risk of a film performance being interrupted by a film break.{{Citation needed|date = September 2012}}

Despite its self-oxidizing hazards, nitrate is still regarded highly as the stock is more transparent than replacement stocks, and older films used denser silver in the emulsion. The combination results in a notably more luminous image with a high contrast ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Case|first1=Jared|title=Art Talk: The Nitrate Picture Show|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cH84Owofkk&amp;t=17m40s|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its explosive nature, not all applications of nitrocellulose were successful. In 1869, with elephants having been poached to near extinction, the [[Cue sports|billiards]] industry offered a [[US$]]10,000 prize to whomever came up with the best replacement for ivory [[billiard ball]]s. [[John Wesley Hyatt]] created the winning replacement, which he created with a new material he invented called camphored nitrocellulose—the first [[thermoplastic]], better known as [[celluloid]]. The invention enjoyed a brief popularity, but the Hyatt balls were extremely flammable, and sometimes portions of the outer shell would explode upon impact. An owner of a billiard saloon in Colorado wrote to Hyatt about the explosive tendencies, saying that he did not mind very much personally but for the fact that every man in his saloon immediately pulled a gun at the sound.&lt;ref&gt;[[Connections (TV series)|Connections]], [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]], Volume 9, "Countdown", 29:00–31:45, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Research: A National Resource |author=United States.

Pressure was applied to the liquid in the cylinder, which resulted in a uniform compression on the nitrocellulose mass, compressing it into a uniform sphere as the heat vaporized the solvents. The ball was then cooled and turned to make a uniform sphere. In light of the explosive results, this process was called the "Hyatt gun method".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nitrocellulose Industry |volume=2 |first=Edward Chauncey |last=Worden |pages=726–727 |year=1911 |publisher=D.

A '''non-directional (radio) beacon''' ('''NDB''') is a [[radio transmitter]] at a known location, used as an aviation or marine [[navigation]]al aid. As the name implies, the signal transmitted does not include {{em|inherent}} directional information, in contrast to other navigational aids such as [[low frequency radio range]], [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) and [[TACAN]]. NDB signals [[Ground wave propagation|follow the curvature of the Earth]], so they can be received at much greater distances at lower altitudes, a major advantage over VOR. However, NDB signals are also affected more by atmospheric conditions, mountainous terrain, coastal refraction and electrical storms, particularly at long range.

==Types of NDBs==
NDBs used for aviation are standardised by [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] Annex 10 which specifies that NDBs be operated on a frequency between 190&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]] and 1750&amp;nbsp;kHz,&lt;ref name="FAAAIM"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/Chap1/aim0101.html#1-1-2| title=U.S. FAA ''Aeronautical Information Manual'' Chapter 1.

In Canada, privately owned NDB identifiers consist of one letter and one number. North American NDBs are categorized by power output, with low power rated at less than 50 [[watt]]s, medium from 50 W to 2,000 W and high being over 2,000 W.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=ADF (Automatic Direction Finder) | url=http://www.allstar.fiu.edu/aero/ADF.htm | work=Navigation Systems – Level 3 | publisher=ALLSTAR Network | date=May 4, 2008 | accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four types of non-directional beacons in the aeronautical navigation service:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Robert Connolly | title=Types of NDB | journal=Radio User |date=February 2016 | volume=11 | issue=2 | issn=1748-8117 | pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* En route NDBs, used to mark airways
* Approach NDBs
* Localizer beacons
* Locator beacons

The last two types are used in conjunction with an [[Instrument Landing System]] (ILS).

==Automatic direction finder equipment==
[[File:Adf mdi.svg|thumb|[[Automatic direction finder]] (ADF) equipment points to the direction of an NDB]]
NDB navigation consists of two parts&amp;nbsp;— the ''[[automatic direction finder]]'' (ADF) equipment on the aircraft that detects an NDB's signal, and the NDB transmitter. The ADF can also locate transmitters in the standard [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[medium wave]] broadcast band (530&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1700&amp;nbsp;kHz at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz increments in the Americas, 531&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1602&amp;nbsp;kHz at 9&amp;nbsp;kHz increments in the rest of the world).

ADF equipment determines the direction or bearing to the NDB station relative to the aircraft by using a combination of directional and non-directional antennae to sense the direction in which the combined signal is strongest. This bearing may be displayed on a [[relative bearing indicator]] (RBI). This display looks like a compass card with a needle superimposed, except that the card is fixed with the 0 degree position corresponding to the centreline of the aircraft. In order to track toward an NDB (with no wind), the aircraft is flown so that the needle points to the 0 degree position. The aircraft will then fly directly to the NDB. Similarly, the aircraft will track directly away from the NDB if the needle is maintained on the 180 degree mark. With a crosswind, the needle must be maintained to the left or right of the 0 or 180 position by an amount corresponding to the drift due to the crosswind. (Aircraft Heading +/- ADF needle degrees off nose or tail = Bearing to or from NDB station).

The formula to determine the compass heading to an NDB station (in a no wind situation) is to take the relative bearing between the aircraft and the station, and add the magnetic heading of the aircraft; if the total is greater than 360 degrees, then 360 must be subtracted.  This gives the magnetic bearing that must be flown:  (RB + MH) [[modulo operation|mod]] 360 = MB.

When tracking to or from an NDB, it is also usual that the aircraft track on a specific bearing. To do this it is necessary to correlate the RBI reading with the compass heading. Having determined the drift, the aircraft must be flown so that the compass heading is the required bearing adjusted for drift at the same time as the RBI reading is 0 or 180 adjusted for drift. An NDB may also be used to locate a position along the aircraft's current track (such as a radial path from a second NDB or a VOR). When the needle reaches an RBI reading corresponding to the required bearing, then the aircraft is at the position. However, using a separate RBI and compass, this requires considerable mental calculation to determine the appropriate relative bearing.

To simplify this task, a compass card driven by the aircraft's magnetic compass is added to the RBI to form a "[[Radio Magnetic Indicator]]" (RMI). The ADF needle is then referenced immediately to the aircraft's magnetic heading, which reduces the necessity for mental calculation. Many RMIs used for aviation also allow the device to display information from a second radio tuned to a [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]] station; the aircraft can then fly directly between VOR stations (so-called "Victor" routes) while using the NDBs to triangulate their position along the radial, without the need for the VOR station to have a collocated [[Distance measuring equipment|DME]]. This display, along with the "[[Omni Bearing Indicator]]" for VOR/ILS information, was one of the primary radionavigation instruments prior to the introduction of the [[Horizontal Situation Indicator]] (HSI) and subsequent digital displays used in [[glass cockpits]].

The principles of ADFs are not limited to NDB usage; such systems are also used to detect the locations of broadcast signals for many other purposes, such as finding emergency beacons.

==Use of non-directional beacons==

===Airways===
[[File:JW NDB transmitter 329.0kHz.jpg|thumb|right|NDB transmitter at 49° 12.35' N, 2° 13.20' W. Callsign JW – 'Jersey West'. 329.0 kHz.]]
A [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] is a line passing through the station that points in a specific direction, such as 270 degrees (due West). NDB bearings provide a charted, consistent method for defining paths aircraft can fly. In this fashion, NDBs can, like VORs, define "[[Airway (aviation)|airways]]" in the sky. Aircraft follow these pre-defined routes to complete a [[flight plan]]. Airways are numbered and standardized on charts. Colored airways are used for low to medium frequency stations like the NDB and are charted in brown on sectional charts. Green and red airways are plotted east and west, while amber and blue airways are plotted north and south. There is only one colored airway left in the continental [[United States]], located off the coast of North Carolina and is called G13 or Green 13. Alaska is the only other state in the United States to make use of the colored airway systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faraim.org/aim/aim-4-03-14-313.html |title=FAA Aeronautical Information Manual, 5-3-4. ''Airways and Route Systems''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilots follow these routes by tracking radials across various navigation stations, and turning at some. While most airways in the United States are based on VORs, NDB airways are common elsewhere, especially in the developing world and in lightly populated areas of developed countries, like the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Arctic]], since they can have a long range and are much less expensive to operate than VORs.

All standard airways are plotted on [[aeronautical chart]]s, such as U.S. sectional charts, issued by the [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).

===Fixes===
NDBs have long been used by aircraft [[navigator]]s, and previously [[Sailor|mariners]], to help obtain a [[Fix (position)|fix]] of their geographic location on the surface of the Earth. Fixes are computed by extending lines through known navigational reference points until they intersect. For visual reference points, the angles of these lines can be determined by [[compass]]; the bearings of NDB radio signals are found using [[radio direction finder]] (RDF) equipment. [[File:NDB Article Airspace Fix Diagram.png|center|Airspace Fix Diagram]]

Plotting fixes in this manner allow crews to determine their position. This usage is important in situations where other navigational equipment, such as [[VHF omnidirectional range|VORs]] with [[distance measuring equipment]] (DME), have failed. In marine navigation, NDBs may still be useful should [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] reception fail.

===Determining distance from an NDB station===
To determine the distance in relation to an NDB station in nautical miles, the pilot uses this simple method:
#Turns the aircraft so that the station is directly off one of the wingtips.
#Flies that heading, timing how long it takes to cross a specific number of NDB bearings.
#Uses the formula: Time to station = 60 x number of minutes flown / degrees of bearing change
#Uses the flight computer to calculate the distance the aircraft is from the station; time * speed = distance

===NDB approaches===
A runway equipped with NDB or VOR (or both) as the only navigation aid is called a non-precision approach runway; if it is equipped with ILS it is called a precision approach runway.

===Instrument landing systems===
NDBs are most commonly used as markers or "locators" for an [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) approach or standard approach. NDBs may designate the starting area for an ILS approach or a path to follow for a [[standard terminal arrival]] procedure, or STAR. In the United States, an NDB is often combined with the outer marker beacon in the ILS approach (called a [[locator outer marker]], or LOM); in Canada, low-powered NDBs have replaced marker beacons entirely. Marker beacons on ILS approaches are now being phased out worldwide with [[Distance measuring equipment|DME]] ranges used instead to delineate the different segments of the approach. 

German Navy U-boats during World War II were equipped with a Telefunken Spez 2113S homing beacon. This transmitter could operate on 100&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1500&amp;nbsp;kHz with a power of 150&amp;nbsp;W. It was used to send the submarine's location to other submarines or aircraft, which were equipped with DF receivers and loop antennas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Robert Connolly | title=Beacon Updates and Frequencies to Try | journal=Radio User |date=December 2010 | volume=5 | issue=12 | issn=1748-8117 | page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NDBs typically operate in the [[frequency]] range from 190 [[Hertz|kHz]] to 535&amp;nbsp;kHz (although they are allocated frequencies from 190 to 1750&amp;nbsp;kHz) and transmit a carrier [[Modulation|modulated]] by either 400 or 1020&amp;nbsp;Hz.  NDBs can also be collocated with a DME in a similar installation for the ILS as the outer marker, only in this case, they function as the inner marker. NDB owners are mostly governmental agencies and airport authorities.

NDB radiators are vertically polarised. NDB [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] are usually too short for [[resonance]] at the frequency they operate – typically perhaps 20m length compared to a wavelength around 1000m. Therefore, they require a suitable matching network that may consist of an inductor and a capacitor to "tune" the antenna. Vertical NDB antennas may also have a '[[T-Antenna|top hat']], which is an umbrella-like structure designed to add loading at the end and improve its radiating efficiency.  Usually a [[ground plane]] or [[Counterpoise (ground system)|counterpoise]] is connected underneath the antenna.

===Other information transmitted by an NDB===
[[File:NonDirectional Beacon WG.ogg|thumb|right| The sound of non directional beacon WG, on 248 kHz, located at 49.8992 North, 97.349197 West, near [[Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport|Winnipeg's main airport ]]]]
Apart from '''Morse Code Identity''' of either 400&amp;nbsp;Hz or 1020&amp;nbsp;Hz, the NDB may broadcast:
*Automatic Terminal Information Service or '''[[Automatic Terminal Information Service|ATIS]]'''
*Automatic Weather Information Service, or '''[[Automatic Weather Information Service|AWIS]]''', or, in an emergency i.e. Air-Ground-Air Communication failure, an Air Traffic Controller using a Press-To-Talk (PTT) function, may modulate the carrier with voice. The pilot uses their ADF receiver to hear instructions from the Tower.
*Automated Weather Observation System or '''[[AWOS]]'''
*Automated Surface Observation System or '''[[Automated airport weather station#Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)|ASOS]]'''
*Meteorological Information Broadcast or '''[[VOLMET]]'''
*Transcribed Weather Broadcast or '''[[TWEB]]'''
*'''[[Pip (Morse code)|PIP]]''' monitoring. If an NDB has a problem, e.g. lower than normal power output, failure of mains power or standby transmitter is in operation, the NDB may be programmed to transmit an extra 'PIP' (a Morse dot), to alert pilots and others that the beacon may be unreliable for navigation.

== Common adverse effects ==
Navigation using an ADF to track NDBs is subject to several common effects:

;Night effect
:Radio waves reflected back by the ionosphere can cause [[Multipath interference|signal strength fluctuations]] 30 to 60 nautical miles (54 to 108&amp;nbsp;km) from the transmitter, especially just before sunrise and just after sunset. This is more common on frequencies above 350&amp;nbsp;kHz. Because the returning sky waves travel over a different path, they have a different phase from the ground wave. This has the effect of suppressing the aerial signal in a fairly random manner. The needle on the indicator will start wandering. The indication will be most erratic during twilight at dusk and dawn.
;Terrain effect
:High terrain like mountains and cliffs can reflect radio waves, giving erroneous readings. Magnetic deposits can also cause erroneous readings
;Thunderstorm effect
: Water droplets and ice crystals circulating within a storm cloud, generate wideband noise. This high power noise may affect the accuracy of the ADF bearing. Lightning, due to the high power output will cause the needle of the RMI/RBI to point for a moment to the bearing of the lightning.
;Shoreline effect
:Radio waves speed up over water, causing the wave front to bend away from its normal path and pull it towards the coast.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Refraction is negligible  perpendicular (90°) to the coast, but increases as the angle of incidence decreases. The effect can be minimised by flying higher or by using NDBs situated nearer the coast.
;Station interference
:Due to congestion of stations in the LF and MF bands, there is the possibility of interference from stations on or near the same frequency. This will cause bearing errors. By day, the use of an NDB within the DOC will normally afford protection from interference. However, at night one can expect interference even within the DOC because of skywave contamination from stations out of range by day. Therefore, positive identification of the NDB at night should always be carried out.
;Dip (bank) angle
:During banking turns in an aircraft, the horizontal part of the loop aerial will no longer be horizontal and detect a signal. This causes displacement of the null in a way similar to the night effect giving an erroneous reading on the indicator which means that the pilot should not obtain a bearing unless the aircraft is wings-level.

While pilots study these effects during initial training, trying to compensate for them in flight is very difficult; instead, pilots generally simply choose a heading that seems to average out any fluctuations.

Radio-navigation aids must keep a certain degree of accuracy, given by international standards, FAA, ICAO, etc.; to assure this is the case, [[Flight inspection]] organizations periodically check critical parameters with properly equipped aircraft to calibrate and certify NDB precision. The ICAO minimum accuracy for NDBs is ±5°

==Monitoring NDBs==
[[File:LVO-397-qsl card.png|thumb|right|200px|A PFC [[QSL card]] from an NDB]]
Besides their use in aircraft navigation, NDBs are also popular with long-distance radio enthusiasts ("DXers"). Because NDBs are generally low-power (usually 25 watts, some can be up to 5&amp;nbsp;kW), they normally cannot be heard over long distances, but favorable conditions in the [[ionosphere]] can allow NDB signals to travel much farther than normal. Because of this, radio DXers interested in picking up distant signals enjoy listening to faraway NDBs. Also, since the band allocated to NDBs is free of broadcast stations and their associated interference, and because most NDBs do little more than transmit their Morse Code callsign, they are very easy to identify, making NDB monitoring an active niche within the [[DXing]] hobby.

In North America, the NDB band is from 190 to 435&amp;nbsp;kHz and from 510 to 530&amp;nbsp;kHz. In Europe, there is a [[Longwave|longwave broadcasting band]] from 150 to 280&amp;nbsp;kHz, so the European NDB band is from 280&amp;nbsp;kHz to 530&amp;nbsp;kHz with a gap between 495 and 505&amp;nbsp;kHz because [[500 kHz]] was the [[International distress frequency|international maritime distress (emergency) frequency]].

The beacons that are between 510&amp;nbsp;kHz and 530&amp;nbsp;kHz can sometimes be heard on AM radios that can tune below the beginning of the [[Medium Wave]](MW) broadcast band. Frequencies close to the MW band, like 515&amp;nbsp;kHz, may be within the receive bandwidth of some AM radios. However, reception of NDBs generally requires a radio receiver that can receive frequencies below 530&amp;nbsp;kHz (the longwave band). A NDB in [[Miramichi, New Brunswick]] once operated at 530&amp;nbsp;kHz as "F9" but had later moved to 520&amp;nbsp;kHz. Most so-called "shortwave" radios also include mediumwave and longwave, and they can usually receive all frequencies from 150&amp;nbsp;kHz to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz, which makes them ideal for listening to NDBs. Whilst this type of receiver is adequate for reception of local beacons, specialized techniques (receiver preselectors, noise limiters and filters) are required for the reception of very weak signals from remote beacons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lwca.org/library/articles/kh6sr/ | title=On the Art of NDB DXing |publisher=The Longwave Club of America |date=1987–1989 | author=Remington, S., KH6SR | accessdate=2008-01-06}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best time to hear NDBs that are very far away (i.e. that are "DX") is the last three hours before sunrise. Reception of NDBs is also usually best during the fall and winter because during the spring and summer, there is more atmospheric noise on the [[Low frequency|LF]] and [[Medium frequency|MF]] bands.

[[Image:Chickens seeking shade.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A [[free range]] pastured chicken system]]
'''Pastured poultry''' is a [[sustainable agriculture]] technique that calls for the raising of laying chickens, meat chickens (broilers), and/or turkeys on [[pasture]], as opposed to indoor confinement. Humane treatment and the perceived health benefits of pastured poultry are causing an increase in demand for such products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://certifiedhumane.org/free-range-and-pasture-raised-officially-defined-by-hfac-for-certified-humane-label/|title="Free Range" and "Pasture Raised" officially defined by HFAC for Certified Humane® label - Certified Humane|date=2014-01-16|newspaper=Certified Humane|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/166143/2010/07/20/research-shows-eggs-pastured-chickens-may-be-more-nutritious|title=Research shows eggs from pastured chickens may be more nutritious {{!}} Penn State University|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joel Salatin]] of [[Swoope, Virginia]], helped to reintroduce the technique at [[Polyface Farm]], and wrote his book ''Pastured Poultry Profits'' to spread the idea to other [[farmers]]. Andy Lee and Herman Beck-Chenoweth expanded on Salatin's techniques, and created some of their own.

The American Pastured Poultry Producers' Association (APPPA) was formed to promote pastured poultry. Its membership consists
largely of pastured poultry farmers.

Though pasture feeding improves the nutritive quality of ruminant meats, the effect of pasture feeding on poultry meat composition is not well established. One trial showed low impact of pasture feeding on vitamin E and fatty acid composition.&lt;ref&gt;Ponte, P.I.P et al..http://ps.fass.org/cgi/content/abstract/87/1/80 Influence of Pasture Intake on the Fatty Acid Composition, and Cholesterol, Tocopherols, and Tocotrienols Content in Meat from Free-Range Broilers. Poult Sci 2008. 87:80-88 2008. 2009-11-20&lt;/ref&gt;

The pens that house the fowl can be made from wood and scrap metal or out of PVC pipe and white tarps.

Pastured poultry is also gaining popularity because it helps the farmer, through reducing [[Capital (economics)|capital costs]], and increasing pasture fertility. It is very well suited for incorporation within a system of [[managed intensive grazing]].
[[Image:Kirbachhof_Gaense.jpg|thumb|Pastured [[Domestic goose|geese]]]]
Pastured poultry is not limited to chickens and turkeys. It includes a variety of other birds, including ducks, geese, and exotics in the poultry family.

==Free-range poultry==
[[File:Chicken tractor on the move-closeup.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[chicken tractor]] in use as part of a pastured poultry system]]
Herman Beck-Chenoweth reintroduced the free-range system that was the most popular way to raise poultry in the U.S. from the 1930s through the 1960s.  The system allows birds to range freely during the day and be safely sequestered on secure skid houses over night.  The addition of a guard animal, such as an [[Komondor]] or [[Anatolian Shepherd]] dog, controls predators.  In the modern American free-range poultry production system, birds are much less crowded and freer to practice normal bird behaviour than in any other pasture-based system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Although frequently listed as a "pasture" method, free-"range" refers to the length of the forage.  Cattle graze "pasture" which is forage over six inches long.  "Range" refers to short forage of 2-4&amp;nbsp;inches.  Free-range is a very sustainable production system that improves the farmer's soil and produces poultry with strong bones and meat with good "mouthfeel".  Combined with proper aging after slaughter, the meat is tender and flavorful.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

'''Photo-Me International plc''' ({{LSE|PHTM}}) based in [[Great Bookham|Bookham]], [[Surrey]] operates [[photobooth]]s. It became a [[public limited company]] in 1963 and has built operations in several countries including [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Philippines]], [[Germany]] and [[France]] in addition to the UK. Although most well known for its photobooths, Photo-Me operates, sells and services a range of instant service equipment.

The Company's shares have been listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] since 1962. In 2007 a shareholder revolt over plans to sell off the vending division forced [[Vernon Sankey]] and [[Serge Crasnianski]] to resign.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/photome-shares-fall-after-profit-warning-761102.html Photo-Me shares fall after profit warning - Business News, Business - The Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318190619/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/photome-shares-fall-after-profit-warning-761102.html |date=March 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009 there was a [[profit warning]]&lt;ref&gt;http://sellyourphotograph.com/how-to-make-money-with-photography&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2009 chief executive Thierry Barel resigned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-l.co.uk/shares/security_news/articles/2653207?rq=article&amp;sedol=0848125{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serge Crasnianski]] was reappointed to the board as a non-executive director in May 2009. He was subsequently appointed Deputy Chairman and Joint Chief Executive and in May 2010 assumed the role of Chief Executive.

Following his reappointment, a major restructuring was carried out at KIS and the Group after losses of £6.3 million in 2008 and recorded a pre-tax profit of £1.6 million in the year ending April 30, 2009. In the year to April 30, 2010, the Group’s loss-making wholesale photo-processing labs business was sold and pre-tax profits were reported at £14.0 million.  Of note was the £31.6 million improvement in the overall cash position such that the net cash on the Balance Sheet was £8.1 million compared to net debt of £23.5 million the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.photo-me.com/financial_reports Photo-Me International PLC, UK - Financial Reports&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This division is trading beyond expectations with 2000 units planned for the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directorstalk.com/serge-crasnianski-chief-executive-photo-lonphtm/|title=Serge Crasnianski, the chief executive of Photo-Me (LON:PHTM)|author=News Team|work=DirectorsTalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2626247/Talk-airing-dirty-laundry-Say-hello-24-hour-OUTDOOR-washing-machine.html|title=Say hello to the 24-hour OUTDOOR washing machine|date=12 May 2014|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016 it was announced that the company had bought the photo division of [[Asda]] stores. Photo-Me will take over the supermarket's 191 photo centres and 172 self-service kiosks. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/2016/11/07/shares/news-and-analysis/news-tips-keywords-studios-photo-me-hsbc-more-Hl56yRRhYSYuneQZo8qQmJ/article.html|title=Investors Chronicle - News &amp; Tips: Keywords Studios, Photo-Me, HSBC &amp; more|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5144">'''Post [[Irradiation]] Examination''' (PIE) is the study of used [[nuclear materials]] such as [[nuclear fuel]]. It has several purposes. It is known that by examination of used fuel that the failure modes which occur during normal use (and the manner in which the fuel will behave during an accident) can be studied. In addition information is gained which enables the users of fuel to assure themselves of its quality and it also assists in the development of new fuels. After major accidents the core (or what is left of it) is normally subject to PIE in order to find out what happened. One site where PIE is done is the [[Institute for Transuranium Elements|ITU]] which is the [[European Union|EU]] centre for the study of highly [[radioactive]] materials.

Materials in a high radiation environment (such as a reactor) can undergo unique behaviors such as swelling&lt;ref&gt;Armin F. Lietzke, [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700006935_1970006935.pdf Simplified analysis of nuclear fuel pin swelling], NASA TN D-5609, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and non-thermal creep.  If there are nuclear reactions within the material (such as what happens in the fuel), the stoichiometry will also change slowly over time.  These behaviors can lead to new material properties, cracking, and fission gas release:

As the fuel is degraded or heated the more volatile fission products which are trapped within the [[uranium dioxide]] may become free.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y. Colle, J.P. Hiernaut, D. Papaioannou, C. Ronchi, A. Sasahara, ''Journal of Nuclear Materials'', 2006, '''348''', 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuel cracking ==
As the fuel expands on heating, the core of the pellet expands more than the rim which may lead to cracking. Because of the thermal stress thus formed the fuel cracks, the cracks tend to go from the centre to the edge in a star shaped pattern.

In order to better understand and control these changes in materials, these behaviors are studied.[https://web.archive.org/web/20040605180056/http://www.scn.ro/lepi.htm][http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cppr/y2001/pres/114819.pdf] [http://www.rertr.anl.gov/Web2002/2003%20Web/Rugirello.html] [http://www.nea.fr/html/trw/docs/mol98/session3/SIIIpaper2.pdf]. Due to the intensely radioactive nature of the used fuel this is done in a [[hot cell]]. A combination of nondestructive and destructive methods of PIE are common.

In addition to the effects of radiation and the fission products on materials, scientists also need to consider the temperature of materials in a reactor, and in particular, the fuel.  Too high fuel temperatures can compromise the fuel, and therefore it is important to control the temperature in order to control the fission chain reaction. 

The temperature of the fuel varies as a function of the distance from the centre to the rim. At distance x from the centre the temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) is described by the [[equation]] where ρ is the power density (W m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) and K&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[thermal conductivity]].

:T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;Rim&lt;/sub&gt; + ρ (r&lt;sub&gt;pellet&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) (4 K&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

To explain this for a series of fuel pellets being used with a rim temperature of 200 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C (typical for a [[BWR]]) with different [[diameters]] and power densities of 250 Wm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; have been modeled using the above equation. Note that these fuel pellets are rather large; it is normal to use oxide pellets which are about 10 mm in diameter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13639">A '''problem solving environment''' (PSE) is a completed, integrated and specialised computer software for solving one class of problems, combining automated problem-solving methods with human-oriented tools for guiding the problem resolution. A PSE may also assist users in formulating problem resolution. A PSE may also assist users in formulating problems, selecting algorithm, simulating numerical value and viewing and analysing results.

== Purpose of  PSE ==
Many PSEs were introduced in the 1990s. They use the language of the respective field and often employ modern [[graphical user interface]]s. The goal is to make the software easy to use for specialists in fields other than [[computer science]]. PSEs are available for generic problems like [[data visualization]] or large systems of equations and for narrow fields of science or engineering like [[gas turbine]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/pse.pdf|title = Problem solving environment and symbolic computing|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = University of California, Berkeley|last = Richard J. Fateman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
The Problem Solving Environment (PSE) released a few years after the release of Fortran and Algol 60, people thought that this system with high-level language would cause elimination of professional programmers. However, surprisingly, PSE has been accepted and even though scientists used it to write programs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/pdf/pse-crpc-596.pdf|title = Problem Solving Environments for Parallel Scientific Computation|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = University of Tenn./Oak Ridge National Lab|last = Jack Dongarra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Problem Solving Environment for Parallel Scientific Computation was introduced in 1960, where this was the first Organised Collection was introduced in 1960, where this was the first Organised Collections with minor standardisation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1970, PSE was initially researched for providing high-class programming language rather than Fortran,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.noveltyjournals.com/journal/IJNRES/Issue-1-March-2015-August-2015/0|title = Minimizing Error in Scientific Numerical Computation|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = International Journal of Novel Research in Engineering and Science|last = Ibrahim Umar Haruna}}&lt;/ref&gt; also Libraries Plotting Packages advent. Development of Libraries were continued, and there were introduction of Emergence of Computational Packages and Graphical systems which is data visualisation. By 1990s, Hypertext, Point and Click had moved towards inter-operability. Moving on, a "Software Parts" Industry finally existed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Throughout a few decades, recently, many PSEs have been developed and to solve problem and also support users from different categories, including education, general programming, CSE software learning, job executing and Grid/Cloud computing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aicit.org/dl/citation.html?id=JCIT-168|title = Review of PSE (Problem Solving Environment) Study|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = Department of Advanced Interdisciplinary Sciences, Utsunomiya University|last = Shigeo Kawata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of PSE ==

=== Grid-Based Numerical Optimisation ===
The shell software GOSPEL is an example of how a PSE can be designed for EHL modelling using a Grid resource. With the PSe, one can visualise the optimisation progress, as well as interact with other simulations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/pkj/Papers/Conf-O/GBJS03.pdf|title = Grid-Based Numerical Optimisation in a Problem Solving Environment|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = The University of Leeds|author1=C.E. Goodyer |author2=M. Berzins |author3=P.K. Jimack |author4=L.E. Scales }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PSE parallelise and embed many individual numerical calculations in an individual numerical calculations in an industrial serial optimisation code. It is built in NAG's IRIS Explorer package to solve EHL and Parallelism problems and can use the gViz libraries, to run all the communication between the PSE and the simulation. Also use MPI, which is part of the NAG libraries, gives significant quick and better solution by combining the max. levels of continuation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Moreover, the system is designed to allow users to steer simulations using visualised output. An example is utilising local minima, or layering additional details when around a local in and out of the simulation and it can imagine the information which is produced in any sharp and also still allow to steer the simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/vis/kwb/e-science/paper098.pdf|title = A Distributed Co-operative Problem Solving Environment|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = The University of Leeds|author1=Mark Walkley |author2=Jason Wood |author3=Ken Brodlie  |last-author-amp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grid-based PSEs for mobile devices ===
PSEs are require a large amount of resources that strain even the most powerful computers of today. Translating PSEs into software that can be used for mobile devices in an important challenge that faces programmers today.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.86.6377&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title = Modeling a Grid-Based Problem-Solving Environment for Mobile Devices|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = Columbus State University|last = Stan Kurkovsky, Bhagyavati, Arris Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grid computing is seen as a solution to the rescue issues of PSEs for mobile devices. This is made possible through a "Brokering Service". This service is started by an initiating device that sends the necessary information for PSE to resolve task. The brokering service then breaks this down into subtasks that distributes the information to various subordinate devices that perform these subtasks.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The brokering necessitates an Active Agent Repository (AAR) and a Task Allocation Table (TAT) that both work to manage the subtasks. A keep-Alive Server is tapped to handle communication between the brokering service and the subordinate devices. The Keep-Alive server relies on a lightweight client application installed in the participating mobile devices.

Security, transparency and dependability are issues that may arise when using the grid for mobile device-based PSEs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Education Support ===
There are a revolution for network-based learning and e-learning for education but it is very difficult to collect education data and data of the student activities. TSUNA-TASTE, is developed by T. Teramoto, a PSE to support education and learning processes. This system may create a new idea of the e-learning by supporting teachers and students in computer-related education. It consists of four parts, including agents of students, an education support server, a database system and a Web server. This system makes e-learning more convenient as information is earlier to store and collect for students and teachers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== P-NCAS ===
A computer-assisted parallel program generation support(P-NCAS), is a PSE, creates a new way to reduce the programming hard task for the computer programming. This program can avoid or reduce the chance that huge computer software breaking down so this restrict uncertainty and major accidents in the society. Moreover, partial differential equations(PDEs) problems can be solved by parallel programs which are generated by P-NCAS supports. P-NCAS employs the Single Program Multi Data (SPMD) and uses a decomposition method for the parallelisation. These enable users of P-NCAS to input problems described by PDES, algorithm and discretisation scheme etc., and to view and edit all details through the visualisation and windows for edition. At last, parallel program will be outputted in C language by P-NCAS and also include documents which show everything has inputted in the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|arxiv = 1503.04501|title = Modeling a Grid-Based Problem-Solving Environment for Mobile Devices|date = |last = Stan Kurkovsky, Bhagyavati, Arris Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Improvement ==
Firstly, it was difficult doing 2-D EHL problems because of the expense and computer power available. The development of parallel 2-D EHL codes and faster computers have now paved the way for 2-D EHL problem solving to be possible. Friction and lubricant data need a higher level of security given their sensitivity. Accounting for simulations may be difficult because these are done in rapidly and in the thousands. This can be solved by a registration system or a 'directory'. Collaborative PSEs with multiple users will encounter difficulties tracking changes, especially which specific changes were made and when those changes were made. This may also be solved with a directory of changes made.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Secondly, future improvement of the Grid-based PSEs for mobile devices, the group aims to generate new scenarios through manipulation of the control variables available. By changing those control variables, the simulation software is able to create scenarios from each other, allowing for more scrutiny of the conditions in each scenario. It is expected that manipulation of three variables will generate twelve different scenarios.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The variables that we are interested in studying are network stability and device mobility. We feel that these variables will hater the greatest impact on grid performance. Our study will measure performance using task completion time as the primary outcome.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== PSE PARK ==
As PSEs grow more complex, the need for computing resources has risen dramatically. Conversely, with PSE applications venturing into fields and environments of growing complexity, the creation of PSEs have become tedious and difficult.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aicit.org/jcit/ppl/Binder6_Part23.pdf|title = PSE Park: framework for problem solving environments|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = J Convergence Info Tech|last = Kobashi H|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirumichi Kobashi and his colleagues have designed a PSE meant to create other PSEs. This has been dubbed as a 'meta PSE' or a PSEs. This was how PSE PSRk was born.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== The Framework ===
The architecture of PSE Park emphasises flexibility and extensibility. These characteristics make it an attractive platform for varied levels of expertise, from entry-level users to developers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

PSE Park provides these through its repository of functions. the repository contains modules required to build PSEs. Some of the most basic modules, called Cores, are used as the foundation of PSEs. More complex modules are available for use by programmers. Users access PSE Park through a console linked to the programmers. Once the user is register, he/she has assess to the repository. A PIPE server is used as the mediator between the user and PSE Park. It grants access to modules and constructs the selected functions into a PSE.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Developers can develop functions, or even whole PSEs, for inclusion into the repository. Entry-level and expert users can access these pre-made PSEs for their own purposes. Given this architecture, PSE Park requires a cloud computing environment to support the enormous data sharing that occurs during PSe use and development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== The PIPE Server ===
The PIPE Server differs from other servers in terms of how it handles intermediate results. Since the PIPE Server acts as a mediator in a meta-PSE, any results or variables generated by a core module are retrieved as global variables to be used by the next core. The sequence or hierarchy is defined by the user. The way, same name variables are revised to the new set of variables.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Another important characteristics of the PIPE Server is that it executes each module or core independently. This means that the language of each module does not have to be the same as the others in the PSE. Modules are implemented depending on the defined hierarchy. This feature brings enormous flexibility for developers and users who have varied backgrounds in programming. The modular format also enables that existing PSEs can be extended and modified easily.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Cores ===
In order be registered, a core must be fully defined. The input and output definitions allow the PIPE server to determine compatibility with other cores and modules. Any lack of definition is flagged by the PIPE server for incompatibility.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Registration Engine and Console ===
The registration engine keeps track of all cores that may be used in PSE Park. A history of use is also created. A core map may be developed in order to help users understand a core to help users understand a core or module better. The console is the users' main interface with PSE Park. It is highly visual and diagrammatic, allowing users to better understand the linkages between modules and cores for the PSEs that they are working on.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6821">'''Recursive economics''' is a branch of modern [[economics]] based on a paradigm of individuals making a series of two-period optimization decisions over time.

==Differences between recursive and neoclassical paradigms==
The neoclassical model assumes a one-period utility maximization for a consumer and one-period [[profit maximization]] by a producer. The adjustment that occurs within that single time period is a subject of considerable debate within the field, and is often left unspecified. A time-series path in the neoclassical model is a series of these one-period utility maximizations.

In contrast, a recursive model involves two or more periods, in which the consumer or producer trades off benefits and costs across the two time periods. This trade-off is sometimes represented in what is called an Euler equation. A time-series path in the recursive model is the result of a series of these two-period decisions.

In the neoclassical model, the consumer or producer maximizes utility (or profits). In the recursive model, the subject maximizes value or welfare, which is the sum of current rewards or benefits and discounted future expected value.

==The recursive model==
The field is sometimes called '''recursive''' because the decisions can be represented by equations that can be transformed into a single functional equation sometimes called a [[Bellman equation]]. This equation relates the benefits or rewards that can be obtained in the current time period to the discounted value that is expected in the next period. The dynamics of recursive models can sometimes also be studied as [[differential equation]]s.

==Pioneers in the field==

The recursive paradigm originated in control theory with the invention of  [[dynamic programming]] by the American mathematician [[Richard E. Bellman]] in the 1950s. Bellman described possible applications of the method in a variety of fields, including Economics, in the introduction to his 1957 book.&lt;ref&gt;''Dynamic Programming'' Princeton, 1957; reissued by Dover&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart Dreyfus]], [[David Blackwell]], and [[Ronald A. Howard]] all made major contributions to the approach in the 1960s.

In addition, some scholars also cite the [[Kalman filter]] invented by [[Rudolf E. Kalman]] and the theory of the maximum formulated by [[Lev Semenovich Pontryagin]] as forerunners of the recursive approach in economics.

==Applications in economics==
Some scholars point to Martin Beckmann and Richard Muth&lt;ref&gt;Martin Beckmann and Richard Muth, 1954, "On the solution to the fundamental equation of inventory theory," ''Cowles Commission Discussion Paper'' 2116.&lt;/ref&gt; as the first application of an explicit recursive equation in economics. However, probably the earliest celebrated economic application of recursive economics was Robert Merton's seminal 1973 article on the [[ICAPM|intertemporal capital asset pricing model]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Merton]], 1973, "An Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model," ''Econometrica 41'': 867–887.&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Merton's portfolio problem]]). Merton's theoretical model, one in which investors chose between income today and future income or capital gains, has a recursive formulation.

Nancy Stokey, Robert Lucas and Edward Prescott describe stochastic and non-stochastic dynamic programming in considerable detail, giving many examples of how to employ dynamic programming to solve problems in economic theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy Stokey]], and [[Robert E. Lucas]], with [[Edward Prescott]], 1989. ''Recursive Methods in Economic Dynamics''. Harvard Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This book led to dynamic programming being employed to solve a wide range of theoretical problems in economics, including optimal [[economic growth]], [[resource extraction]], [[principal–agent problem]]s, [[public finance]], business [[investment]], [[asset pricing]], [[factor of production|factor]] supply, and [[industrial organization]].

The approach gained further notice in macroeconomics from the extensive exposition by Ljungqvist &amp; Sargent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lars Ljungqvist]] &amp; [[Thomas Sargent]], 2000, 2004, 2012. ''Recursive Macroeconomic Theory''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This book describes recursive models applied to theoretical questions in [[monetary policy]], [[fiscal policy]], [[taxation]], [[economic growth]], [[search theory]], and [[labor economics]].

In investment and finance, Avinash Dixit and Robert Pindyck showed the value of the method for thinking about [[capital budgeting]], in particular showing how it was theoretically superior to the standard neoclassical investment rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avinash Dixit]] &amp; Robert Pindyck, 1994. ''Investment Under Uncertainty''. Princeton Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Anderson adapted the method to the valuation of operating and start-up businesses &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Patrick L., ''Business Economics &amp; Finance'', CRC Press, 2004, {{ISBN|1-58488-348-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Patrick L., ''Economics of Business Valuation'', Stanford University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and to the estimation of the aggregate value of privately held businesses in the US.&lt;ref&gt;The Value of Private Businesses in the United States, ''Business Economics'' (2009) 44, 87–108. {{doi|10.1057/be.2009.4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are serious computational issues that have hampered the adoption of recursive techniques in practice, many of which originate in the [[curse of dimensionality]] first identified by Richard Bellman.

Applied recursive methods, and discussion of the underlying theory and the difficulties, are presented in Mario Miranda &amp; Paul Fackler (2002),&lt;ref&gt;Miranda, M., &amp; Fackler, P., 2002.

'''Scala''' is a producer of multimedia software. It was founded in 1987 as a [[Norway|Norwegian]] company called Digital Visjon. It is headquartered near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, and has subsidiaries in Europe and Asia.

== History ==
In 1987 a young Norwegian entrepreneur, Jon Bøhmer founded the company "Digital Visjon" in [[Brumunddal]], Norway to create multimedia software on the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] computer platform. In 1988 they released their first product which was named InfoChannel 0.97L, which had hotels and cable-TV companies as their first customers.

In 1990, they redesigned the program with a new [[graphical user interface]]. They renamed the company and the software "Scala" and released a number of multimedia applications.  The company attracted investors, mainly from Norway and incorporated in the [[United States|US]] in 1994 and is now based in the United States with their [[Europe]]an headquarters located in the [[Netherlands]].

The name "Scala" was given by Bøhmer and designer Bjørn Rybakken and represents the scales in colors, tones and the opera in Milano. The name inspired a live actor animation made by Bøhmer and Rybakken using an Amiga, a [[video camera]] and a frame-by-frame video [[digitizer]]. The animation, named "Lo scalatore" ([[Italian language|Italian]] for 'The Climber'), featured a magic trick of [[India]]n [[fakirs]] of a man climbing a ladder and disappearing in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randelshofer.ch/animations/anims/scala/LoScalatore2.animVE.html|title=Amiga Animations - LoScalatore|publisher=[www.randelshofer.ch]|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This animation was then included into one of the Demo Disks of Scala Multimedia in order to show the capabilities of that presentation software in loading and playing animations whilst also manipulating it with other features of the software.

In 1994 Scala released Multimedia MM400 and InfoChannel 500.

In 1996, due to the bankruptcy of Commodore, Scala left the Amiga platform and started delivering the same applications under MS-DOS. Scala Multimedia MM100, Scala Multimedia Publisher and Scala InfoChannel 100 were released for the x86 platform. Scala MM100 won Byte Magazine's "Best of Comdex" in 1996.

==Corporate governance==
As of December 2013, the [[CEO]] of Scala is [[Tom Nix]], who was formerly a regional vice president.&lt;ref name=pbj&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nix succeeds [[Gerard Bucas]], who retired after nine years.&lt;ref name=pbj/&gt;

== Scala Multimedia ==
The first versions for the Amiga computer were a video titler and slide show authoring system. Scala was bundled with [[typefaces]], background images, and a selection of [[Film transition|transition]] effects to be applied to them. The artwork was designed by Bjørn Rybakken. Scala was also capable of working with [[Genlock]] equipment to superimpose titles over footage played through the devices video input.

Succeeding versions of the program on the same platform added features such as animation playback, more effects ("Wipes") and the ability to interact with multimedia devices through a programming language called "Lingua" (Latin for "language").

With its move to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], Scala became more complex and gained the ability to support languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Visual Basic]].

== Scala5 ==
In late 2008, Scala stopped calling their product line InfoChannel and went through a period of referring only to their "solutions". At the start of 2009, the product line was being called 'Scala5' and being referred to as such in all their press releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scala.com/news/2008-press-releases/scala-announces-an-on-time-release-of-the-much-anticipated-release-4-of-scala5|title=Scala Announces an on Time Release of the Much Anticipated Release 4 of Scala5|publisher=Scala Inc.|date=2008-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scala5 has three main components: Scala Designer, an authoring program which is used to create dynamic content, Scala Content Manager, which is used to manage and distribute content, and Scala Player, which plays back the distributed content.

== Scala Enterprise ==
Scala's latest suite of [[Digital signage]] software is referred to as Scala Enterprise. The solution, a software suite consisting of Scala Designer, Scala Player, and Scala Content Manager officially launched in mid- 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.displayinsight.com/the-new-scala-enterprise-communication-solution-is-live|title=The new Scala Enterprise communication solution|publisher=Display Insight|date=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At launch, release version 10.0 featured [[HTML5]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] player support, the usage of interactive features on mobile devices to engage with retail and corporate communications audiences, and social media integrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalsignagenews.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=507:scala-redesigns-gui-and-html5-content-playback-&amp;catid=41:industry-news&amp;Itemid=71|title=Scala Redesigns GUI and HTML5 Content Playback|publisher=Digital Signage News EMEA|date=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chenjeh1.jpg|thumb|Chenjeh kebab in [[Iran]]]]
[[File:Seafood skewers.jpg|thumb|Seafood skewers sold in South Korea: ''mun-kkochi'' ([[Enteroctopus dofleini|giant octopus]]), ''sora-kkochi'' ([[Turbo cornutus|horned turban]]), and ''jju-kkochi'' ([[Amphioctopus fangsiao|webfoot octopus]]).]]

A '''skewer''' is a thin metal or wood stick used to hold pieces of food together.&lt;ref name="OED2 definition"&gt;{{Cite OED2|skewer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word may sometimes be used as a [[metonym]], to refer to the entire food item served on a skewer, as in "chicken skewers". Skewers are used while [[grilling]] or [[roasting]] meats and fish, and in other culinary applications.

In English, ''brochette'' is a borrowing of the French word for skewer. In [[cookery]], ''en brochette'' means 'on a skewer', and describes the form of a [[Dish (food)|dish]] or the method of cooking and serving pieces of food, especially grilled meat or seafood, on skewers; for example "lamb cubes en brochette".&lt;ref name="Collins en brochette"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/en-brochette |title=En brochette definition and meaning |website=[[Collins English Dictionary]] |access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skewers are often used in a variety of [[kebab]] dishes.

== Utensil ==
Metal skewers are typically stainless steel rods with a pointed tip on one end and a grip of some kind on the other end for ease of removing the food. Non-metallic skewers are often made from [[bamboo]]; however, any suitable wood may be used. Prior to grilling, wooden skewers may be soaked in water to avoid burning. A related device is the [[rotisserie]] or spit, a large rod that rotates meat while it cooks.

== History ==
[[File:Akrotiri terracotta firedogs with zoomorphic finials.jpg|thumb|Pair of firedogs, 17th century BC.]]
Evidence of the [[prehistoric]] use of skewers, as far back as the [[Lower Paleolithic]], has been found at a 300,000-year-old site in [[Schöningen]], Germany. A stick with a burnt tip was found to have been used to cook meat over a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898158291 |title=Archaeology of food : an encyclopedia |last=Gaudzinski-Windheuser |first=Sabine |isbn=9780759123663 |editor-last=Metheny |editor-first=Karen Bescherer |location=Lanham |at=section ''Paleolithic Diet'' |oclc=898158291 |editor-last2=Beaudry |editor-first2=Mary C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations in [[Santorini]], [[Greece]], unearthed [[Fire dog|sets of stone cooking supports]] used before the 17th century BC. In the supports there are pairs of indentations that may have been used for holding skewers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tovima.gr/default.asp?pid=2&amp;ct=1&amp;artId=382454&amp;dt=04/02/2011#ixzz1D5R96Hvx To Vima (in Greek)], 6-2-2011 (picture 2 of 7)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] in ''[[Iliad]]'' (1.465) mentions pieces of meat roasted on spits (ὀβελός). In [[Classical Greece]], a small spit or skewer was known as ὀβελίσκος (''obeliskos''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2371909 ὀβελίσκος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus, dim. of ὀβελός (''obelos''), [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2371912 ὀβελός].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aristophanes]] mentions such skewers being used to roast thrushes.&lt;ref&gt;''Acharnians'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristoph.+Ach.+1007&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0240 1007]&lt;/ref&gt; The story is often told of medieval Middle Eastern soldiers - usually Turkish or Persian, depending on the storyteller - who cooked meat skewered on their swords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=1961 |title=FIRE DANCE—The Fascinating Story of Lamb Shish Kebab |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZweAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=persian+soldiers+swords+kebab |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |volume=37 part 3 |page=346 |access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17199754 |title=Food around the world |last=Ridgwell |first=Jenny |date=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198327288 |location=Oxford |pages=45 |oclc=17199754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most well-known skewered foods around the world is the [[shish kebab]]. The earliest literary evidence for the Turkish word {{lang|tk|şiş}} (shish) as a food utensil comes from the 11th-century ''Diwan Lughat al-Turk'', attributed to [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Mahmud of Kashgar]]. He defines shish as both a skewer and 'tool for arranging noodles' (''minzam tutmaj''), though he is unique in this regard as all subsequent known historical references to ''shish'' define it as a skewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Food on the Move| publisher=[[Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery]] |date=1996 |chapter=The Horseback Kitchen of Central Asia |accessdate = 2018-07-16| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Food_on_the_Move.html?id=uYqTiD7SbcQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nişanyan"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2018-07-16|title=Nişanyan Sözlük - şiş |trans-title=Nişanyan Dictionary - shish |language=Turkish |url=http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=şiş|website=Nişanyan Sözlük}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of skewered foods ==

===Kebab===
{{main|Kebab|List of kebabs}}

A large variety of dishes cooked on skewers are [[kebab]]s (meat dishes prevalent in [[Middle Eastern cuisine]] and the [[Muslim world]]), or derived from them. Examples include Turkish ''[[shish kebab]]'', Iranian ''[[jujeh kabab]]'', Chinese ''[[chuan (food)|chuan]]'', and Southeast Asian [[satay]]. However, "kebab" is not synonymous with "skewered food", and many kebab dishes such as [[chapli kebab]] are not cooked on skewers. On the other hand, English speakers may sometimes use the word ''kebab'' to refer to any food on a skewer.

===Other===
Dishes, other than kebabs, prepared with skewers include American [[city chicken]] and [[corn dog]], Brazilian ''[[churrasco]]'', [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] Peruvian ''[[anticucho]]'', Italian ''[[arrosticini]]'', Japanese ''[[kushiyaki]]'' and ''[[kushikatsu]]'', Korean ''[[jeok]]'' and ''[[kkochi]]'', Nepali ''[[sekuwa]]'', Portuguese ''[[espetada]]'', Vietnamese ''[[nem nướng]]'' and ''[[chạo tôm]]''.

Appetizers and [[hors d'oeuvre]]s may often be skewered together with small sticks or toothpicks; the Spanish [[pincho]] is named after such a skewer.&lt;ref name="Barrenechea 1998"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/797821047 |title=The Basque table : passionate home cooking from Spain's most celebrated cuisine |last=Barrenechea |first=Teresa |date=1998 |publisher=Harvard Common Press |isbn=9781558325234 |location=Boston, Mass. |oclc=797821047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small, often decorative, skewers of glass, metal, wood or bamboo known as "olive picks" or "[[cocktail stick]]s" are used for [[Cocktail garnish|garnishes]] on [[cocktail]]s and other [[alcohol]]ic beverages. Many types of snack food, such as [[candy apple]]s, [[banana cue]], ''[[ginanggang]]'', ''[[elote]]'', and ''[[tanghulu]]'', are sold and served "on a stick" or skewer, especially at outdoor markets, fairs, and sidewalk or roadside stands around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="650">The '''steam to oil ratio''' is a measure of the [[water]] and [[energy]] consumption related to [[Petroleum|oil]] production in [[Steam injection (oil industry)|cyclic steam stimulation]] and [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] [[oil production]]. SOR is the ratio of unit of steam required to produce unit of Oil. The typical values are three to eight and two to five respectively. This means two to eight barrels of water converted into [[steam]] is used to produce one [[barrel of oil]].

'''TOSLINK''' (from ''Toshiba Link''&lt;ref name='TOTX1701_spec'&gt;[http://www.semicon.toshiba.co.jp/openb2b/websearch/productDetails.jsp?partKey=TOTX1701%28F%29 Toshiba TOTX1701] TOSLINK Transmitter Module specifications.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a standardized [[optical fiber connector]] system.&lt;ref name='toshiba_what_is_toslink'&gt;[http://www.semicon.toshiba.co.jp/eng/product/opto/faq/toslink/answer_toslink01.html "What Is TOSLINK?"]  Toshiba Toslink FAQs.&lt;/ref&gt; Also known generically as an "'''optical audio cable'''" or just "'''optical cable'''", its most common use is in consumer [[Sound recording|audio]] equipment (via a "digital optical" socket), where it carries a [[digital audio]] stream from components such as [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[DVD]] players, [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] recorders, computers, and modern [[video game console]]s, to an [[AV receiver]] that can decode two channels of uncompressed lossless [[PCM audio]] or {{nowrap|[[Audio compression (data)|compressed]] 5.1/7.1}} [[surround sound]] such as [[Dolby Digital]] or [[DTS (sound system)|DTS Surround System]]. Unlike [[HDMI]], TOSLINK does not have the bandwidth to carry the lossless versions of [[Dolby TrueHD]], [[DTS-HD Master Audio]], or more than two channels of [[PCM audio]].

Although TOSLINK supports several different media formats and physical standards, digital audio connections using the rectangular [[Electronic Industries Association of Japan|EIAJ]]/[[Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association|JEITA]] RC-5720 (also CP-1201 and JIS C5974-1993 F05) connector are by far the most common.&lt;ref name="digikey_toshiba"&gt;{{cite web|title=Product guide, Fiber-Optic Devices TOSLINK(tm)|url=http://www.digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/Toshiba_264/PDF/Toshiba_BCE0037_catalog.pdf}} 100621 digikey.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The optical signal is a red light with a peak wavelength of {{nowrap|650 nm.}}&lt;ref name='TOTX1701_spec'/&gt;  Depending on the [[modulation|type of modulated signal]] being carried, other optical wavelengths may be present.&lt;!-- Digi-Key hints at 650 nm, but Engdahl hints at 660 nm --&gt;&lt;ref name="digikey_toshiba" /&gt;

== History ==
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:TOSLINK.jpg|thumb|left|TOSLINK connector (JIS F05)]]

[[Toshiba]] originally created TOSLINK to connect their CD players to the [[audio receiver|receiver]]s they manufactured, for [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio streams. The software layer is based on the "Sony Philips Digital Interconnect Format" ([[S/PDIF]]), while the hardware layer utilizes a fiber optic transmission system, rather than the electrical (copper) hardware layer of S/PDIF. TOSLINK was soon adopted by manufacturers of most CD players. It can often be found on video source (DVD and Blu-ray players, cable boxes and game consoles) to connect the digital audio stream to [[Dolby Digital]]/[[Digital Theatre System|DTS]] decoders.

The name is a registered trademark of Toshiba, created from ''TOShiba-LINK''. Variations of the name, such as ''TOSlink'', ''TosLink'', and ''Tos-link'', are also seen, while the official generic name for the standard is ''EIAJ optical''.

[[ADAT Lightpipe]] or simply ADAT Optical uses an optical transmission system similar to TOSLINK, and is used in the professional music/audio industry. While the ADAT Lightpipe format uses the same JIS F05 connectors as TOSLINK, the ADAT Lightpipe data format is not compatible with S/PDIF. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Properties and issues ==
Due to their high attenuation of light, the effective range of plastic optical cables is limited to {{nowrap|5–10 m}}.&lt;ref name="length"/&gt; They can temporarily fail or be permanently damaged if tightly bent. Although less commonly available and more expensive than plastic optical fiber (POF) cables, glass or silica optical fibers have lower losses and can extend the range of the TOSLINK system.

Optical cables are not susceptible to electrical problems such as [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]] and [[RF interference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audioholics.com/education/cables/understanding-digital-interconnects |title=Understanding Digital Interconnects |publisher=Audioholics.com |accessdate=2007-07-12 |author=Joseph D. Cornwall |date=December 31, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[Image:Fiber optic illuminated.jpg|thumb|left|A TOSLINK fiber optic audio cable being illuminated on one end]]

Several types of fiber can be used for TOSLINK: inexpensive {{nowrap|1 mm}} plastic optical fiber, higher-quality multistrand plastic optical fibers, or quartz glass optical fibers, depending on the desired bandwidth and application. TOSLINK cables are usually limited to {{nowrap|5 meters}} in length, with a technical maximum&lt;ref name="length" /&gt; of {{nowrap|10 meters,}} for reliable transmission without the use of a signal booster or a repeater. However, it is very common for interfaces on newer consumer electronics (satellite receivers and PCs with optical outputs) to easily run over {{nowrap|30 meters}} on even low-cost {{nowrap|(0.82 USD/m 2009&lt;!--2009-06-19--&gt;)}} TOSLINK cables.  TOSLINK transmitters operate at a nominal optical wavelength of {{nowrap|650 nm}} {{nowrap|(~461.2 THz).}}

=== Mini-TOSLINK ===
[[File:Minitoslink.png|thumb|right|A mini-TOSLINK adapter]]
'''Mini-TOSLINK''' is a standardized [[optical fiber connector]] smaller than the standard square TOSLINK connector commonly used in larger consumer [[Sound recording|audio]] equipment.

A '''tablet press''' is a mechanical device that compresses [[Powder (substance)|powder]] into [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] of uniform size and weight. A press can be used to manufacture tablets of a wide variety of materials, including [[pharmaceuticals]], illicit drugs such as [[MDMA]], cleaning products, and [[cosmetics]]. To form a tablet, the granulated material must be metered into a cavity formed by two [[Punch (engineering)|punches]] and a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]], and then the punches must be pressed together with great force to fuse the material together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schwartz, Joseph |author2=Lieberman, Herbert A. |author3=Lachman, Leon |title=Pharmaceutical dosage forms--tablets |publisher=Dekker |location=New York |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-8247-8044-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tablet is formed by the combined pressing action of two punches and a die. In the first step of a typical operation, the bottom punch is lowered in the die creating a cavity into which the granulated feedstock is fed. The exact depth of the lower punch can be precisely controlled to meter the amount of powder that fills the cavity. The excess is scraped from the top of the die, and the lower punch is drawn down and temporarily covered to prevent spillage. Then, the upper punch is brought down into contact with the powder as the cover is removed. The force of compression is delivered by high pressure compression rolls which fuse the granulated material together into a hard tablet. After compression, the lower punch is raised to eject the tablet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Isadore Kanfer |author2=Shargel, Leon |author3=Kanfer, Izadore |title=Generic drug product development: solid oral dosage forms |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-8247-5460-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Old tablet press.jpg|thumb|An old rotary tablet press]]

Tablet tooling design is critical to ensuring a robust tablet compression process. Considerations when designing pharmaceutical tablet compression tool design include tooling set, head flat, top head angle, top head radius, head back angle, and punch shank. As well as ensuring a single dose of drug, the tablet tooling is also critical in ensuring the size, shape, embossing and other physical characteristics of the tablet that are required for identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Punches and Dies for Tabletting|url=http://www.pharmacmc.com/|website=PharmaCMC|publisher=UXM|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 2 types of tablet presses: single-punch and rotary tablet presses. Most high speed tablet presses take the form of a rotating turret that holds any number of punches. As they rotate around the turret, the punches come into contact with cams which control the punch's vertical position. Punches and dies are usually custom made for each application, and can be made in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and can be customized with manufacturer codes and scoring lines to make tablets easier to break. Depending on tablet size, shape, material, and press configuration, a typical modern press can produce from 250,000 to over 1,000,000 tablets an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nash, Robert J. |author2=Wachter, Alfred H |author3=Berry, Ira R. |title=Pharmaceutical process validation |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-8247-0838-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3297">'''Target Motion Analysis''' ('''TMA''') is a process to determine the position of a target using passive sensor information. Sensors like passive ''[[Radar|RADAR]]'' and ''[[Sonar|SONAR]]'' provide directional and occasionally frequency information. TMA is done by marking from which direction the sound comes at different times, and comparing the motion with that of the operator's own ship. Changes in relative motion are analyzed using standard geometrical techniques along with some assumptions about limiting cases. There are two different ways to execute TMA: manual and automated.

== Manual TMA ==
Manual TMA methods involve computation executed by humans instead of computers. There exist several manual TMA methods such as: Ekelund Ranging, 1934 Rule, Spears Wheel etc.

=== Ekelund ranging ===

One of the best known TMA techniques is Ekelund ranging.&lt;ref&gt;D.H. Wagner, W.C. Mylander and T.J. Sanders (1999). ''Naval Operations Analysis'', United States of America: Naval Institute Press,. {{ISBN|9781591149507}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a method that is specifically designed for a 2leg-1zig scenario. This method works by first estimating the bearing rates during the first &lt;math&gt;BR^1&lt;/math&gt; and second leg &lt;math&gt;BR^2&lt;/math&gt;. Secondly, one calculates the speed of advance along the line of sight with the target on the first &lt;math&gt;SOA^1&lt;/math&gt;and second leg &lt;math&gt;SOA^2&lt;/math&gt;. The rule then states that the range of the target at the moment of maneuver&lt;ref&gt;spelling correction source dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;r_2 = \textstyle\frac{SOA^2 - SOA^1}{BR^1 - BR^2}&lt;/math&gt;

To check the solution of an Ekelund Ranging solution there is also an iPhone app available.&lt;ref&gt;SlimeSoft [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ekelund-range/id305672427?mt=8 "Ekelund Range"]. Retrieved on 15 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automated TMA ==
Automated TMA methods involve computations executed by computers. This allows for the simultaneous tracking of multiple targets.  There exist several automated TMA methods such as: Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE), etc.

=== Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) ===
The MLE method tries to fit the directional measurements (bearings) to a theoretical linear motion model of the target. The bearing function to be fitted is:

:&lt;math&gt; \beta (t) = arctan2(\textstyle\frac{V_y*t + y_0 - y^OBS}{V_x*t + x_0 - x^O}) &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; measerements of &lt;math&gt;beta_i&lt;/math&gt; have been collected, the problem reduces to an overdetermined system of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; non-linear equations. The state vector associated is
:&lt;math&gt; X = [x_0  y_0  V_x  V_y] &lt;/math&gt;
and can be solved by numerical estimation procedures like ''[[Gauss–Newton algorithm|Gauss-Newton]]''.

A '''telegraph sounder''' is an antique [[electromechanical]] device used as a receiver on [[electrical telegraph]] lines during the 19th century.  It was invented by [[Alfred Vail]] after 1850 to replace the previous receiving device, the cumbersome Morse register&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

When a telegraph message comes in it produces an audible "clicking" sound representing the short and long keypresses – "dots" and "dashes" – which are used to represent text characters in [[Morse code]].  A [[telegraph operator]] would translate the sounds into characters representing the telegraph message.

[[Telegraph]] networks, used from the 1850s to the 1920s to transmit text messages long distances, transmitted information by pulses of current of two different lengths, called "dots" and "dashes" which spelled out text messages in [[Morse code]].  A telegraph operator at the sending end of the line would create the message by tapping on a switch called a [[telegraph key]], which rapidly connects and breaks the circuit to a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], sending pulses of current down the line.

The telegraph sounder was used at the receiving end of the line to make the Morse code message audible.  Its simple mechanism was similar to a [[relay]]. It consisted of an [[electromagnet]] attached to the telegraph line, with an iron [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] near the magnet's pole balanced on a pivot, held up by a counterweight.  When [[Current (electricity)|current]] flowed through the [[electromagnet]]'s winding, it created a [[magnetic field]] which attracted the armature, pulling it down to the electromagnet, resulting in a "click" sound.  When the current ended, the counterweight pulled the armature back up to its resting position, resulting in a "clack" sound.   Thus, as the telegraph key at the sending end makes and breaks the contact, the sounder echoes the up and down state of the key.

It was important that a sounder make a sound both when the circuit was broken and when it was restored.  This was necessary for the operator to clearly distinguish the long and short keypresses – the "dashes" and "dots" – that make up the characters in [[morse code]].

'''The COED Project''', or '''the COmmunications and EDiting Project''', was an innovative [[software]] project created by the Computer Division of [[NOAA]], [[US Department of Commerce]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]] in the 1970s. This project was designed, purchased and implemented by the in-house computing staff rather than any official organization.

== Intent ==
The computer division previously had a history of frequently replacing its [[mainframe computers]]. Starting with a [[CDC 1604]], then a [[CDC 3600]], a couple of [[CDC 3800]]s, and finally a [[CDC 6600]]. The department also had an [[XDS 940]] timesharing system which would support up to 32 users on dial-up modems. Due to rapidly changing requirements for computer resources, it was expected that new systems would be installed on a regular basis, and the resultant strain on the users to adapt to each new system was perceived to be excessive. The COED project was the result of a study group convened to solve this problem.

The project was implemented by the computer specialists who were also responsible for the purchase, installation, and maintenance of all the computers in the division. COED was designed and implemented in long hours of [[overtime]]. The data communications aspect of the system was fully implemented and resulted in greatly improved access to the XDS 940 and CDC 6600 systems. It was also used as the front end of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070115012951/http://www.sara.nl/index_eng.html - Free University of Amsterdam's SARA system] for many years.

== Design ==
A complete networked system was a pair of [[MODCOMP|Modcomps]]: one II handled up to 256 communication ports, and one IV handled the disks and file editing. The system was designed to be fully redundant. If one pair failed the other automatically took over. All computer systems in the network were kept [[time synchronization|time-synchronized]] so that all file dates/times would be accurate - synchronized to the [[National Bureau of Standards]] [[atomic clock]], housed in the same building. Another innovation was [[asynchronous serial communication|asynchronous]] dynamic speed recognition. After a terminal connected to a port, the user would type a Carriage Return character, and the software would detect the speed of the terminal (in the range of 110 to 9600 bit/s) and present a log in message to the user at the appropriate speed. Due to limitations of the operating systems which came with the Modcomps, new Operating systems had to be created, CORTEX for the Modcomp II's and IV BRAIN for the Modcomp IV's.

== History ==
(Dates are approximate - from memory)
*1970: First discussions of new communications system for XDS 940
*1971: The COED Project was created
*1972: The system was designed, funding was approved, a Request for Quote for the hardware was issued and executed
*1973: The hardware components—2 [[MODCOMP|Modcomp]] IV's and 2 Modcomp II's were delivered and installed and implementation began
*1976: (April 8) First communication through COED to XDS 940 worked!
*1979: project terminated

== Staff ==
Those involved in the original design meetings were:
Ralph Slutz, George Sugar, Jim Winkelman and most of the COED implementors. Support was also provided by Tom Gray.

The COED implementors were:
W. Schyler (Sky) Stevenson, Project Manager and operating system implementer
Howard Bussey, Mark Emmer, David Lillie, and Vern Schryver. The 6600 interface to COED was implemented by Anthony Brittain, Dan Dechatelets and Kathy Browne.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3087">In physics, the '''thermal conductance quantum''' &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; describes the rate at which [[heat]] is transported through a single [[Ballistic conduction|ballistic]] [[phonon]] channel of temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. It is given by:

&lt;math&gt;g_{0} = \frac{\pi^2 {k_B}^2 T}{3h} \approx (9.464\times10^{-13} W/K^{2})T&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Thermal conductivity|thermal conductance]] of any electrically insulating structure that exhibits ballistic phonon transport is a positive integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt;. The thermal conductance quantum was first measured in 2000.&lt;ref name=Schwab&gt;{{cite journal|title=Measurement of the quantum of thermal conductance|journal=Nature|year=2000|first=K.|last=Schwab|author2=E.

For ballistic electrical conductors, the [[electron]] contribution to the thermal conductance is also quantized as a result of the electrical [[conductance quantum]] and the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]], which has been quantitatively measured at both cryogenic (~20 mK) &lt;ref name=Jezouin&gt;{{cite journal|title=Quantum Limit of Heat Flow Across a Single Electronic Channel|journal=Science|year=2013|first=S.et al.|last=Jezouin |volume=342|pages=601|doi=10.1126/science.1241912|pmid=24091707||arxiv=1502.07856|bibcode=2013Sci...342..601J}}&lt;/ref&gt; and room temperature (~300K)&lt;ref name=Cui&gt;{{cite journal|title=Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions

The thermal conductance quantum, also called as quantized thermal conductance, maybe understood from the Wiedemann-Franz law, which show that 

&lt;math&gt;
{\kappa \over \sigma} = LT,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a universal constant, 

&lt;math&gt;
L = {\pi^2 k_B^2 \over 3e^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the regime with quantized electric conductance, one may have

&lt;math&gt;
\sigma = {n e^2 \over h},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an integer, called as TKNN number. Then 

&lt;math&gt;
\kappa = L T \sigma = {\pi^2 k_B^2 \over 3e^2} \cdot {n e^2 \over h} T = {\pi^2 k_B^2 \over 3h} n T = g_0 n,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g_0&lt;/math&gt; was defined in the beginning of this file.

'''''VBS1''''' (Virtual Battlefield Systems 1) is a military simulator which relies heavily on modern [[game engine|game technology]] and is therefore generally referred to as a [[serious game]]. The platform is derived from the [[First-person narrative|first-person]] entertainment game [[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis|Operation Flashpoint]] and is developed by [[Bohemia Interactive Australia]]. The system enables the practice of small unit [[military tactics]] in an [[interactive]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment. The platform provides real-time scenario management facilities, customized vehicles and equipment, user-definable mission scenarios, and variable environmental conditions. This combination of military simulator functionality and modern gaming technology proved to be a success and resulted in a broad military customer base. [[VBS2]] is the successor of this platform.

==History==

The Virtual Battlespace Systems 1 concept was initially conceived in 2001 as the result of a business decision made between Bohemia Interactive Studio (BIS) and creator David Lagettie. The BIS [[computer game]] [[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis|Operation Flashpoint]] (''OFP'') aimed for a highly realistic military [[gameplay]]. In order to achieve this the game featured large scale terrain areas combined with a high level of detail, an integrated [[topographic map]], a fully functional command and control system for small teams, and considerable flexibility in the [[game engine]]. These functionalities gave the game obvious [[military]] potential, and as a result [[Bohemia Interactive Australia|Bohemia Interactive Australia (BIA)]] was formed and given the task of converting the product explicitly for military purposes.

The first military [[customer]] for ''VBS1'' was the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), who were provided ''VBS1'', a USMC addon pack and [[MOUT]] training facilities modelled to a high level of detail in late 2001. The majority of [[software development|development]] work was carried out by BIA, with [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] and limited development conducted by [[Coalescent Technologies]].

In 2002, the product was further developed, which resulted in the first versions of the ''VBS1'' [[After Action Review]] (AAR) and Observer being developed. The [[Real Virtuality (engine)|Real Virtuality]] engine was upgraded to version 1.94 in order to output data as required by the AAR system.

The [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) began conducting trials with ''VBS1'' in 2003, and a large amount of work was conducted by the [[Virtual Environments and Simulation Lab]] (VESL), part of the [[University of New South Wales]] at the Australian Defence Force Academy. VESL conducted (for the ADF) the [[Virtual Infantry Section Experiment]] (VISE), which was the first [[Analytic induction|analytical]] use of the product by a [[military organisation]].

The AAR 2 and Observer 2 were developed in 2003 in order to record the large quantities of data generated during VISE (previous versions were unable to handle more than a few [[squad]]s in the one [[scenario]]), and the engine was updated to version 1.99. This gave VBS1 an inherent and powerful data recording and mission playback capability.

''VBS1'' was refined and improved and underwent limited public release on May 21, 2004 (previously the product was only released to military (or similar) organisations). The release occurred primarily to increase awareness of the product and foster a user community.  Exclusive distribution rights for ''VBS1'' to North America was given to Coalescent Technologies, with BIA and BIS distributing to the rest of the world via the online shop.

The ADF conducted trials of ''VBS1'' in November 2004 as part of the VICE. The trials resulted in ''VBS1'' being recommended as a suitable [[training]] [[tool]] for a range of military purposes: from [[Infantry Minor Tactics]] through to [[combined arms]] operations. The results of the trial are summarized in the VESL paper "Proficient Soldier to Skilled Gamer: Training for COTS Success".

The ADF provided a large amount of feedback regarding the product and this resulted in engine updates and improvements to the AAR and Observer. The ''VBS1'' 2.07 patch was released in mid-2005 and also AAR 3 and Observer 3. In accordance with ADF requests, the ''VBS1'' Instructor [[User interface|Interface]] and also numerous [[convoy]] training enhancements were implemented. The ADF used these new features as part of pre-deployment training for the [[Al Muthanna Task Group 2]] ([[AMTG2]]), who were to deploy to [[Iraq]] in late 2005. BIA developed the town of [[As Samawah]] (as part of Terrain Pack 3) in ''VBS1'' to a high level of detail from [[photos]] and maps, and also a 50&amp;nbsp;km² [[Al Muthanna]] terrain area.

In 2005 computer game Operation Flashpoint was used by the US based company [[BBN Technologies]] to create [[DARWARS Ambush! Convoy Simulator]] a commercial military training product developed as part of the [[DARPA]] DARWARS program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualbattlespace.com/ambush.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, a ''VBS1'' enterprise license has been negotiated with the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF), which includes provision of ''VBS1'' and an update to ''[[VBS2]]'' for both the ADF and the NZDF.

In April 2006 was BIA chosen by Australian Defence Force (ADF) to develop a number of [[Loadmaster]] Virtual Reality Simulators (LVRS) utilizing ''VBS1'' simulator engine.

In August 2006 the USMC has purchased an enterprise license of Virtual Battlespace (VBS) covering an unlimited number of VBS1 and [[VBS2]] licenses. Two version of VBS1 delivered: 'VBS1 Developer' provides a fully functional product for use in simulation centers and 'VBS1 Lite' for wider distribution.

In November 2006 the [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School|United States Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School]] ([[USAJFKSWCS]]) has purchased a site license of Virtual Battlespace (VBS). The license provides a large number of VBS1 and VBS2 licenses to USAJFKSWCS.

'''Technical specifications and detailed information on the valve audio amplifier''', including its development history.

== Circuitry and performance ==
=== Characteristics of valves ===
[[Vacuum tube|Valve]]s (also known as vacuum tubes) are very high input [[electrical impedance|impedance]] (near infinite in most circuits) and high-output impedance devices. They are also high-voltage / low-current devices.

The characteristics of valves as gain devices have direct implications for their use as [[audio amplifier]]s, notably that [[power amplifiers]] need output [[transformer]]s (OPTs) to translate a high-output-impedance high-voltage low-current signal into a lower-voltage high-current signal needed to drive modern low-impedance loudspeakers (cf. [[transistor]]s and [[FET]]s which are relatively low voltage devices but able to carry large currents directly).

Another consequence is that since the output of one stage is often at ~100 V offset from the input of the next stage, [[direct coupling]] is normally not possible and stages need to be coupled using a capacitor or transformer. Capacitors have little effect on the performance of amplifiers. Interstage transformer coupling is a source of distortion and phase shift, and was avoided from the 1940s for high-quality applications; transformers also add cost, bulk, and weight.

=== Basic circuits ===
The following circuits are simplified conceptual circuits only, real world circuits also require a smoothed or regulated power supply, heater for the filaments (the details depending on if the selected valve types are directly or indirectly heated), and the cathode resistors are often bypassed, etc.

====The common cathode gain stage====
[[Image:Goc1.GIF|frame|right|Triode common cathode gain stage]]
The basic gain stage for a valve amplifier is the auto-biased common cathode stage, in which an anode resistor, the valve, and a cathode resistor form a potential divider across the supply rails. The resistance of the valve varies as a function of the voltage on the grid, relative to the voltage on the cathode.

In the auto-bias configuration, the "operating point" is obtained by setting DC potential of the input grid at zero volts relative to ground via a high-value "grid leak" resistor. The anode current is set by the value of the grid voltage relative to the cathode and this voltage is now dependent upon the value of the resistance selected for the cathode branch of the circuit.

The anode resistor acts as the load for the circuit and is typically order of 3-4 times the anode resistance of the valve type in use. The output from the circuit is the voltage at the junction between the anode and anode resistor. This output varies relative to changes in the input voltage and is a function of the voltage amplification of the valve "mu" and the values chosen for the various circuit elements.

Almost all audio preamplifier circuits are built using cascaded common cathode stages.

The signal is usually coupled from stage to stage via a coupling capacitor or a transformer, although direct coupling is done in unusual cases.

The cathode resistor may or may not be bypassed with a capacitor. Feedback may also be applied to the cathode resistor.

====The single-ended triode (SET) power amplifier====
[[File:Single-ended triode power amplifier (circuit diagram).gif|thumb|450px|right|Single-ended triode power amplifier]]

A simple [[Single-ended triode|SET]] power amplifier can be constructed by cascading two stages, using an output transformer as the load.

====Differential stages====
{{Main|Differential amplifier}}

Two triodes with the cathodes coupled together to form a [[differential pair]]. This stage has the ability to cancel common mode (equal on both inputs) signals, and if operated in class A also has the merit of having the ability to largely reject any supply variations (since they affect both sides of the differential stage equally), and conversely the total current drawn by the stage is almost constant (if one side draws more instantaneously the other draws less), resulting in minimal variation in the supply rail sag, and this possibly also interstage distortion.

Two power valves (may be triodes or tetrodes) being differentially driven to form a push–pull output stage, driving a push–pull transformer load. This output stage makes much better use of the transformer core than the single-ended output stage.

====The long-tail pair====
[[File:Long tail pair (circuit diagram).gif|thumb|500px|right|Long-tail pair]]
A ''long tail'' is a constant current (CC) load as the shared cathode feed to a differential pair. In theory the more constant current linearises the differential stage.

The CC may be approximated by a resistor dropping a large voltage, or may be generated by an active circuit (either valve, transistor or [[Field effect transistor|FET]] based)

The [[long-tail pair]] can also be used as a [[phase splitter]].  It is often used in [[guitar amplifiers]] (where it is referred to as the "phase inverter") to drive the power section.

====The concertina phase splitter====
As an alternate to the long-tail pair, the ''concertina'' uses a single triode as a variable resistance within a potential divider formed by Ra and Rk either side of the valve. The result is that the voltage at the anode swings exactly and opposite to the voltage at the cathode, giving a perfectly balanced phase split. the disadvantage of this stage (cf the differential long-tail pair) is that it does not give any gain. Using a double triode (typically octal or noval) to form a SET input buffer (giving gain) to then feed a concertina phase splitter is a classic push–pull front end, typically followed by a driver (triode) and (triode or pentode) output stage (in ultra linear in many cases) to form the classic push–pull amplifier circuit.

====The push–pull power amplifier====
[[File:Push-pull power amplifier (circuit diagram).gif|thumb|600px|right|Push–pull power amplifier]]

The [[push–pull output]] circuit shown is a simplified variation of the [[Williamson amplifier|Williamson topology]], which comprises four stages:

*a SET input stage to buffer the input and give some voltage gain.
*a phase splitter, usually of the cathodyne or "concertina" type. This generates exactly equal but opposite drive signals for the following push–pull circuitry, but gives no gain. Note that as shown, the Williamson topology concertina phase splitter is direct coupled (with a resistor) to the input stage. This requires careful design of the input stage since the nominal voltage of the input valve anode will define the operating point of the concertina as well. Other topologies include the paraphase, floating paraphase and differential (long-tailed pair).
*a driver stage. This gives further voltage gain for each of the push–pull signals, and depending on the output stage valve's requirements may be a type selected for higher voltage or lower Z drive capability.
*The output stage, where the load is the transformer rather than an anode resistor. The original Williamson used [[KT66]] pentodes "triode strapped" (operating as triodes). The majority of later push–pull amplifiers used the ultralinear connection instead.

====Cascode====
[[Image:Cascode-triode-full.png|thumb|right|Triode stack]]
The [[cascode]] (a contraction of the phrase ''cascade to cathode'') is a two-stage [[amplifier]] composed of a [[transconductance]] amplifier followed by a [[buffer amplifier|current buffer]]. In valve circuits, the cascode is often constructed from two [[triode]]s connected in series, with one operating as a [[common grid]] and thus acting as a [[voltage regulator]], providing a nearly constant anode voltage to the other, which operates as a [[valve audio amplifier technical specification#The common cathode gain stage|common cathode]]. This improves input-output isolation (or reverse transmission) by eliminating the [[Miller effect]] and thus contributes to a much higher [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], higher [[input impedance]], high [[output impedance]], and higher [[gain (electronics)|gain]] than a single-triode stage.

====Tetrode/pentode stages====
The tetrode has a [[screen grid]] (g2) which is between the anode and the first grid and normally serves, like the [[valve audio amplifier technical specification#Cascode|cascode]], to eliminate the Miller effect and therefore also allows a higher bandwidth and/or higher gain than a triode, but at the expense of linearity and noise performance.

A [[pentode]] has an additional suppressor grid (g3) to eliminate the [[vacuum tubes#Tetrodes and pentodes|tetrode kink]]. This is used for improved performance rather than extra gain and is usually not accessible externally. Some of these valves use aligned grids to minimise grid current and beam plates instead of a third grid, these are known as "[[beam tetrode]]s".

It was realised (and many pentodes were specifically designed to permit) that by strapping the screens to the grid/anode a tetrode/pentode just became a triode again, as such making these late design valves very flexible. "Triode strapped" tetrodes are often used in modern amplifier designs that are optimised for quality rather than power output.

====Ultra-linear====
{{Main|Ultra-linear}}
In 1937, [[Alan Blumlein]] originated a configuration between a "triode strapped" tetrode and normal tetrode, that connects the extra grid (screen) of a tetrode to a tap from the OPT ''part way between'' the anode voltage and the supply voltage. This electrical compromise gives a gain and linearity equal to the best traits of both extremes. In a 1951 engineering paper published by [[David Hafler]] and [[Herbert Keroes]], they determined that when the screen tap was set to approximately 43% of anode voltage, an optimized condition within the output stage occurred, which they referred to as ''ultra-linear''. By the late 1950s, this design became the dominant configuration for high-fidelity PP amplifiers.

====Output transformerless====
[[Julius Futterman]] pioneered a type of amplifier known as "[[output transformerless]]" (OTL). These use paralleled valves to match with speaker impedances (typically 8 ohms). This design require numerous valves, run hot, and because they attempt to match impedances in a way fundamentally different from a transformer{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}, they often have a unique sound quality.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} 6080 triodes, designed for regulated power supplies, were low-impedance types sometimes pressed into transformerless use.

===Single-ended triode (SET) power amplifiers===
Some [[valve amplifier]]s use the [[single-ended triode]] (SET) topology that uses the gain device in class A. SETs are extremely simple and have low parts count. Such amplifiers are expensive because of the output transformers required.

This type of design results in an extremely simple distortion spectrum comprising a monotonically decaying series of harmonics. Some consider this distortion characteristic is a factor in the attractiveness of the sound such designs produce. Compared with modern designs SETs adopt a minimalist approach, and often have just two stages, a single stage triode voltage amplifier followed by a triode power stage.  However, variations using some form of active current source or load, not considered a gain stage, are used.

The typical valve using this topology in (rare) current commercial production is the [[300B]], which yields about 5 watts in SE mode. Rare amplifiers of this type use valves such as the 211 or [[845 (vacuum tube)|845]], capable of about 18 watts. These valves are bright emitter transmitting valves, and have thoriated tungsten filaments which glow like light bulbs when powered.

See paragraphs further down regarding high-power commercially available SET amplifers offering up to 40 watts with no difficulty, following the development of output transformers to overcome the above restrictions.

The pictures below are of a commercial SET amplifier, and also a prototype of a hobbyist amplifier.

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
Image:CommercialSE.JPG|A commercial SE amplifier
Image:PetesPrototype.jpg|A prototype hobbyist constructed SET amplifier
&lt;/gallery&gt;

One reason for SETs being (usually) limited to low power is the extreme difficulty (and consequent expense) of making an output transformer that can handle the plate current without saturating, while avoiding excessively large capacitive parasitics.

===Push–pull (PP) / differential power amplifiers===
The use of differential ("push–pull") output stages cancels standing bias current drawn through the output transformer by each of the output valves individually, greatly reducing the problem of [[Saturation (magnetic)|core saturation]] and thus facilitating the construction of more powerful amplifiers at the same time as using smaller, wider bandwidth and cheaper transformers.

The cancellation of the differential output valves also largely cancels the (dominant) even-order harmonic distortion products of the output stage, resulting in less THD, albeit dominated now by odd-order harmonics and no longer monotonic.

Ideally, cancellation of even-order distortion is perfect, but it the real world it is not, even with closely matched valves. PP OPTs usually have a gap to prevent saturation, though less than required by a single-ended circuit.

Since the 1950s the vast majority of high-quality valve amplifiers, and almost all higher-power valve amplifiers have been of the push–pull type.

[[Push–pull output]] stages can use triodes for lowest Z&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; and best linearity, but often use tetrodes or pentodes which give greater gain and power. Many output valves such as KT88, EL34, and EL84 were specifically designed to be operated in either triode or tetrode mode, and some amplifiers can be switched between these modes. Post-Williamson, most commercial amplifiers have used tetrodes in the "ultra-linear" configuration.

====Class A====
Class A pure triode PP stages are sufficiently linear that they can be operated without feedback, although modest NFB to reduce distortion, reduce Z&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;, and control gain may be desirable. Their power efficiency is, however, much less than class AB (and, of course, class B); significantly less output power is available for the same anode dissipation.

Class A PP designs have no [[crossover distortion]] and distortion becomes negligible as signal amplitude is reduced. The effect of this is that class A amplifiers perform extremely well with music that has a low average level (with negligible distortion) with momentary peaks.

A disadvantage of Class A operation for power valves is a shortened life, because the valves are always fully "on" and dissipate maximum power all of the time. Signal amplifier valves not operating at high power are not affected in this way.

Power supply regulation (variation of voltage available with current drawn) is not an issue, as average current is essentially constant; AB amplifiers, which draw current dependent upon signal level, require attention to supply regulation.

====Class AB and B====
Class B and AB amplifiers are more efficient than class A, and can deliver higher power output levels from a given power supply and set of valves.

However, the price for this is that they suffer from crossover distortion, of more or less constant amplitude regardless of signal amplitude.  This means that class AB and B amplifiers produce their lowest distortion percentage at near maximum amplitude, with poorer distortion performance at low levels. As the circuit changes from pure class A, through AB1 and AB2, to B, open-loop crossover distortion worsens.&lt;!--"pure class B amplifiers may be better suited to e.g. pop and rock music where constant high sound levels predominate" nonsense OR; means you can never play pop and rock at low volume--&gt;
  
Class AB and B amplifiers use NFB to reduce open-loop distortion. Measured distortion spectra from such amplifiers{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} show that distortion percentage is dramatically reduced by NFB, but the residual distortion is shifted towards higher harmonics.

In a class B push–pull amplifier, output valve current which must be provided by the power supply ranges from nearly zero for zero signal to a maximum at maximum signal. Consequently, for linear response to transient signal changes the power supply must have good regulation.

Only class A can be used in single-ended mode, as part of the signal would otherwise be cut off. The driver stage for class AB2 and B valve amplifiers must be capable of supplying some signal current to the power valve grids ("driving power").

===Biasing===
The biasing of a push–pull output stage can be adjusted (at the design stage, usually not in a finished amplifier) between class A (giving best open-loop linearity) through classes AB1 and AB2, to class B (giving greatest power and efficiency from a given power supply, output valves and output transformer).

Most commercial valve amplifiers operate in Class AB1 (typically pentodes in the ultra-linear configuration), trading open-loop linearity against higher power; some run in pure class A.

=== Circuit topology ===
The typical topology for a PP amplifier has an input stage, a [[phase (waves)|phase]] splitter, a driver and the output stage, although there are many variations of the input stage / phase splitter, and sometimes two of the listed functions are combined in one valve stage. The dominant phase splitter topologies today are the [[concertina]], floating [[paraphase]], and some variation of the [[long-tail pair]].

The gallery shows a modern home-constructed, fully differential, pure class A amplifier of about 15 watts output power without negative feedback, using 6SN7 low-power dual triodes and KT88 power tetrodes.

=== Output transformers ===
Because of their inability to drive low impedance loads directly, valve audio amplifiers must employ output [[transformer]]s to step down the impedance to match the loudspeakers.

Output transformers are not perfect devices and will always introduce some odd harmonic distortion and amplitude variation with frequency to the output signal. In addition, transformers introduce frequency-dependent phase shifts which limit the overall negative feedback which can be used, to keep within the Nyquist stability criteria at high frequencies and avoid oscillation. In recent years, however, the development of improved transformer designs and winding techniques greatly reduce these unwanted effects within the desired pass-band, moving them further out to the margins.

===Negative feedback (NFB)===
{{Main|Negative feedback amplifier}}
Following its invention by [[Harold Stephen Black]], negative feedback (NFB) has been almost universally adopted in amplifiers of all types, to substantially reduce distortion, flatten frequency response, and reduce the effect of component variations. This is especially needed with non-class-A amplifiers.

Feedback very much reduces distortion percentage, but the distortion spectrum becomes more complex, with a far higher contribution from higher harmonics;&lt;ref name=highharm&gt;[http://www.stereophile.com/news/10065/ Stereophile: Negative feedback doesn't always decrease amplifier distortion!]&lt;/ref&gt; the high harmonics, if at an audible level, are much more undesirable than lower ones,&lt;ref name=highharm/&gt; so that the improvement due to lower overall distortion is partly cancelled by its nature. It is reported that under some circumstances the absolute amplitude of higher harmonics may increase with feedback, although total distortion decreases.&lt;ref name=highharm/&gt;

NFB reduces output impedance (Z&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;) (which may vary as a function of frequency in some circuits). This has two important consequences:

*Loudspeakers that have impedance versus frequency functions that deviate substantially from flat will develop substantially non-flat frequency responses when used with High Z&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; amplifiers.

====Valve noise and noise figure====
Like any amplifying device, valves add noise to the signal to be amplified. Noise is due to device imperfections plus unavoidable temperature-dependent thermal fluctuations (systems are usually assumed to be at room temperature, ''T''&amp;nbsp;= 295 K). Thermal fluctuations cause an electrical noise power of &lt;math&gt;k_B T B&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is the Boltzmann constant and ''B'' the bandwidth. Correspondingly, the voltage noise of a resistance ''R'' into an open circuit is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{4 k_B\cdot T\cdot B\cdot R}&lt;/math&gt; and the current noise into a short circuit is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{4 k_B\cdot T\cdot B/R}&lt;/math&gt;.
 
The noise figure is defined as the ratio of the noise power at the output of the amplifier to the noise power that would be present at the output if the amplifier were noiseless (due to amplification of thermal noise of the signal source). An equivalent definition is: noise figure is the factor by which insertion of the amplifier degrades the signal to noise ratio. It is often expressed in decibels (dB). An amplifier with a 0&amp;nbsp;dB noise figure would be perfect.

The noise properties of valves at audio frequencies can be modelled well by a perfect noiseless valve having a source of voltage noise in series with the grid. For the EF86 low-noise audio pentode valve, for example, this voltage noise is specified (see e.g., the Valvo, Telefunken or Philips data sheets) as 2 microvolts integrated over a frequency range of approximately 25&amp;nbsp;Hz to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz. (This refers to the integrated noise, see below for the frequency dependence of the noise spectral density.) This equals the voltage noise of a 25 kΩ resistor. Thus, if the signal source has an impedance of 25 kΩ or more, the noise of the valve is actually smaller than the noise of the source. For a source of 25 kΩ, the noise generated by valve and source are the same, so the total noise power at the output of the amplifier is the square root of two times the noise power at the output of the perfect amplifier.  It is not simply double because the noise sources are random and there is some partial cancellation in the combined noise. The noise figure is then 1.414, or 1.5&amp;nbsp;dB. For higher impedances, such as 250 kΩ, the EF86's voltage noise is 1/10&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; lower than the sources's own noise, and the noise figure is ~1&amp;nbsp;dB. For a low-impedance source of 250 Ω, on the other hand, the noise contribution of the valve is 10 times larger than the signal source, and the noise figure is approximately ten, or 10&amp;nbsp;dB.

To obtain low noise figure, the impedance of the source can be increased by a transformer. This is eventually limited by the input capacitance of the valve, which sets a limit on how high the signal impedance can be made if a certain bandwidth is desired.

The noise voltage density of a given valve is a function of frequency. At frequencies above 10&amp;nbsp;kHz or so, it is basically constant ("white noise"). White noise is often expressed by an equivalent noise resistance, which is defined as the resistance which produces the same voltage noise as present at the valve input. For triodes, it is approximately (2-3)/''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the transconductivity. For pentodes, it is higher, about (5-7)/''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;. Valves with high ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; thus tend to have lower noise at high frequencies.

In the audio frequency range (below 1–100&amp;nbsp;kHz), "1/''f''" noise becomes dominant, which rises like 1/''f''. Thus, valves with low noise at high frequency do not necessarily have low noise in the audio frequency range. For special low-noise audio valves, the frequency at which 1/''f'' noise takes over is reduced as far as possible, maybe to something like a kilohertz. It can be reduced by choosing very pure materials for the cathode nickel, and running the valve at an optimized (generally low) anode current.

====Microphony====
{{Main|Microphony}}
Unlike solid-state devices, valves are assemblies of mechanical parts whose arrangement determines their functioning, and which cannot be totally rigid. If a valve is jarred, either by the equipment being moved or by acoustic vibrations from the loudspeakers, or any sound source, it will produce an output signal, as if it were some sort of [[microphone]] (the effect is consequently called [[microphony]]). All valves are subject to this to some extent; low-level voltage amplifier valves for audio are designed to be resistant to this effect, with extra internal supports. The [[EF86]] mentioned in the context of noise is also designed for low microphony, though its high gain makes it particularly susceptible.

==Modern audiophile hi-fi amplification==

For [[high-end audio]], where cost is not the primary consideration, valve amplifiers have remained popular and indeed during the 1990s made a commercial resurgence.

Circuits designed since then in most cases remain similar to circuits from the valve age, but benefit from advances in ancillary component quality (including capacitors) as well as general progress across the electronics industry which gives designers increasingly powerful insight into circuit operation. Solid-state power supplies are more compact, efficient, and can have very good regulation.

Semiconductor power amplifiers do not have the severe limitations on output power imposed by thermionic devices; accordingly loudspeaker design has evolved in the direction of smaller. more convenient, loudspeakers, [[Trade off|trading off]] power efficiency for small size, giving speakers of similar quality but smaller size which require much greater power for the same loudness than hitherto. In response, many modern valve push–pull amplifiers are more powerful than earlier designs, reflecting the need to drive inefficient speakers.

===Modern valve preamplifiers===
When valve amplifiers were the norm, user-adjustable "tone controls" (a simple two-band non-graphic [[Equalization (audio)|equaliser]]) and [[electronic filters]] were used to allow the listener to change frequency response according to taste and room acoustics; this has become uncommon. Some modern equipment uses graphic equalisers, but valve preamplifiers tend not to supply these facilities (except for [[RIAA equalization|RIAA]] and similar equalisation needed for vinyl and shellac discs).

Modern signal sources, unlike vinyl discs, supply [[line level]] signals without need for equalisation. It is common to drive valve power amps directly from such source, using passive volume and input source switching integrated into the amplifier, or with a minimalist "line level" control amplifier which is little more than passive volume and switching, plus a buffer amplifier stage to drive the interconnects.

However, there is some small demand for valve preamps and filter circuits for studio microphone amplifiers, equalising preamplifiers for vinyl discs, and exceptionally for active crossovers.

===Modern valve power amplifiers===

====Commercial single-ended triode amplifiers====
When valve amplifiers were the norm, SETs more-or-less disappeared from western products except for low-power designs (up to 5 watts), with push–pull indirectly heated triodes or triode-connected valves such as [[EL84]] becoming the norm.

However, the far east never abandoned valves, and especially the SET circuit; indeed the extreme interest in all things audiophile in Japan and other far eastern countries sustained great interest in this approach.

*One of the key connections between this far-eastern attitude towards the SET, and the west was Jean Hiraga, longtime editor of ''l'audiophile'' in France (and in French).&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Lynn (2005). [http://www.nutshellhifi.com/library/europe3.html Travels to Europe and the Triode Festival (Part 3)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A very extreme example of an almost "zen" or "poetic" approach to amplifier design in the far east—very different from the Western engineering-led approach—is the work of [[Susumu Sakuma]],&lt;ref&gt;Susumu Sakuma. [http://www10.big.or.jp/~dh/ Explore the Wonders of DIRECT HEATING]&lt;/ref&gt; although Sakuma's designs are far from mainstream

Since the 1990s a niche market has developed again in the west for low-power commercial SET amplifies (up to 7 watts), notably using the 300B valve in recent years, which has become fashionable and expensive. Lower-power amplifiers based on other vintage valve types such as 2A3 and 45 are also made.

Even more rarely, higher powered SETs are produced commercially, usually using the 211 or 845 transmitting valves, which are able to deliver 20 watts, operating at 1000 V. Notable amplifiers in this class are those from Audio Note corporation (designed in Japan), including the "Ongaku", voted amplifier of the year during the late 1990s. A very small number of hand-built products of this class sell at very high prices (from US$10,000). The Wavac 833 may be the world's most expensive hi-fi amplifier, delivering around 150 watts using an [[833A]] valve.

Aside from this Wavac and a very few other high-power SETs, SET amplifiers usually need to be carefully paired with very efficient speakers, notably horn and transmission-line enclosures and full-range drivers such as those made by [[Klipsch]] and [[Lowther Loudspeaker Systems|Lowther]], which invariably have their own quirks, offsetting their advantages of very high efficiency and minimalism.

Some companies such as the Chinese company "[[Ming Da]]" make low power SETs using valves other than the 300B, such as KT90 (a development of the KT88) and up to the more powerful sister of the 845, the 805ASE, with output power of 40 watts over the full audio range from 20&amp;nbsp;Hz. This is made possible by an output transformer design which does not saturate at high levels and has high efficiency.

====Commercial push–pull (PP) amplifiers====
Mainstream modern loudspeakers give good sound quality in a compact size, but are much less power-efficient than older designs and  require powerful amplifiers to drive them. This makes them unsuitable for use with valve amplifiers, particularly lower-power single-ended designs. Valve hi-fi power amplifier designs since the 1970s have had to move mainly to class AB1 push–pull (PP) circuits. Tetrodes and pentodes, sometimes in ultra-linear configuration, with significant negative feedback, are the usual configuration.

Some class A push–pull amplifiers are made commercially. Some amplifiers can be switched between classes A and AB; some can be switched into triode mode.

Major manufacturers in the PP valve market include:

*[[Audio Research]]
*[[Cary Audio Design]]
*[[Jadis]]
*[[Ming Da]]
*[[McIntosh Laboratory]]

== Hobbyist amplifier construction ==
The simplicity of valve amplifiers, especially single-ended designs, makes them viable for home construction. This has some advantages:

*Being able to use highly regarded valves produced many years ago and are only available in ones and twos;
*The home constructor can experiment with different component types, or different samples of a component.

=== Construction ===
Point-to-point hand-wiring tends to be used rather than circuit boards in low-volume high-end commercial constructions as well as by hobbyists. This construction style is satisfactory due to ease of construction, adapted to the number of physically large and chassis mounted components (valve sockets, large supply capacitors, transformers), the need to twist heater wiring to minimise hum, and as a side effect benefiting from the fact that "flying" wiring minimises capacitive effects.

One picture below shows circuit constructed using "standard" modern industrial parts (630 V MKP capacitors/metal film resistors). One advantage a hobbyist has over a commercial producer is the ability to use higher quality parts that are not reliably available in production volumes (or at a commercially viable cost price). For example, the "silver top getter" Sylvania brown base 6SN7s in use in the external picture date from the 1960s.

Another picture shows exactly the same circuit constructed using Russian military production Teflon capacitors and non-inductive planar film resistors, of the same values.

The wiring of a commercial amplifier is also shown for comparison

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Unusual designs===
====Very high power SETs====
Very occasionally, very-high-power valves (usually designed for use in radio transmitters) from decades ago are pressed into service to create one-off SET designs (usually at very high cost). Examples include valves 211 and 833.

The main problem with these designs is constructing output [[transformer]]s able to sustain the plate current and resultant flux density without core saturation over the full audio-frequency spectrum. This problem increases with power level.

Another problem is that the voltages for such amplifiers often pass well beyond 1&amp;nbsp;kV, which forms an effective disincentive to commercial products of this type.

====Parallel push–pull (PPP) amplifiers====
[[Image:Heffette.jpg|thumb|right|Hobbyist constructed Mono PPP amplifier using 813/QB2/250. ~ 65W in Class A. Weight is 48 kg, dissipation is 1 kW]]
Many modern commercial amplifiers (and some hobbyist constructions) place multiple pairs of output valves of  readily obtainable types in parallel to increase power, operating from the same voltage required by a single pair. A beneficial side effect is that the output impedance of the valves, and thus the transformer turns ratio needed, is reduced, making it easier to construct a wide bandwidth transformer.

Some high-power commercial amplifiers use arrays of standard valves (e.g. EL34, KT88) in the parallel push–pull (PPP) configuration (e.g. Jadis, Audio Research, McIntosh, Ampeg SVT).

Some home-constructed amplifiers use pairs of high-power transmitting valves (e.g. 813) to yield 100 watts or more of output power per pair in class AB1 (ultra-linear).

====Output transformerless amplifiers (OTL)====
The output transformer (OPT) is a major component in all mainstream valve power amplifiers, accounting for significant cost, size, and weight. It is a compromise, balancing the needs for low stray capacitance, low losses in iron and copper, operation without saturation at the required direct current, good linearity, etc.

One approach to avoid the problems of OPTs is to avoid the OPT entirely, and directly couple the amplifier to the loudspeaker, as is done with most solid-state amplifiers. Some designs without output transformers (OTLs) were produced by [[Julius Futterman]] in the 1960s and '70s, and more recently in different embodiments by others.

Valves normally match much higher impedances than that of a loudspeaker. Low-impedance valve types and purpose-designed circuits are required. Reasonable efficiency and moderate Z&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; (damping factor) can be achieved.

These effects mean that OTLs have selective speaker load requirements, just like any other amplifier. Generally a speaker of at least 8 ohms is required, although larger OTLs are often quite comfortable with 4 ohm loads. Electrostatic speakers (often considered difficult to drive) often work especially well with OTLs.

The more recent and more successful OTL circuits employ an output circuit generally known as a [[Circlotron]]. The Circlotron has about one-half the output impedance of the Futterman-style (totem-pole) circuits. The Circlotron is fully symmetrical and does not require large amounts of feedback to reduce output impedance and distortion. Successful embodiments use the 6AS7G and the Russian 6C33-CB power triodes.

A common myth is that a short-circuit in an output valve may result in the loudspeaker being connected directly across the power supply and destroyed. In practice, the older Futterman-style amplifiers have been known to damage speakers, due not to shorts but to oscillation. The Circlotron amplifiers often feature direct-coupled outputs, but proper engineering (with a few well-placed fuses) ensures that damage to a speaker is no more likely than with an output transformer.

Modern OTLs are often more reliable, sound better, and are less expensive than many transformer-coupled valve approaches.

====Direct coupled amplifiers for electrostatics and headphones====
In a sense this niche is a subset of OTLs however it merits treating separately because unlike an OTL for a loudspeaker, which has to push the extremes of a valve circuit's ability to deliver relatively high currents at low voltages into a low impedance load, some headphone types have impedances high enough for normal valve types to drive reasonably as OTLs, and in particular electrostatic loudspeakers and headphones which can be driven directly at hundreds of volts but minimal currents.

Once more there are some safety issues associated with direct drive for electrostatic loudspeakers, which in extremis may use transmitting valves operating at over 1 kV. Such systems are potentially lethal.
