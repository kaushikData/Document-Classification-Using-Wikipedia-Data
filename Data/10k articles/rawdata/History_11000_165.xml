      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3284">'''Archaeoseismology''' is the study of past [[earthquake]]s deriving from the analysis of [[archaeological site]]s. Such analyses reveal information about seismic events that have not been historically recorded. Such [[data]] can also help to document seismic risk in areas subject to extremely destructive earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapfre.com/fundacion/html/revistas/seguridad/n128/en/article2.html|title=Archaeoseismology as an emerging science|last=Giner-Robles|first=J.L.|date=2012|work=Sequridad Y Medio Ambiente|access-date= 15 March 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, an international conference held in [[Athens]] marked the beginning of modern research in the field of Archaeoseismology, described as a "study of ancient earthquakes, and their [[social]], [[cultural]], [[historical]] and [[natural]] effects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sintubin|first=Manuel|editor=Beer, Michael |editor2=Kougioumtzoglou, A. Ioannis |editor3=Patelli, Edoardo |editor4=Au, Siu-Kui  Ιvan|title=Encyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering|year=2012|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-36197-5|pages=1–17|chapter=Archaeoseismology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeological record==
The [[archaeological record]] can carry three different types of evidence of seismic activity:
* The [[archaeological remains]] are displaced due to the movement of an active [[fault (geology)|fault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Altunel|first=E.|year=2003|title=Earthquake faulting at ancient Cnidus, SW Turkey|journal=Turkish Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=12|issue=1|pages=137–151|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The remains and [[artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] contained in destruction deposits, associated with the decline of soil or seismic vibration, can be used the dating of earthquake damage. Other archaeological evidence, such as repairs, abandonment of an archaeological site or [[architecture|architectural]] changes, can help in identifying ancient earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marco|first=S.|year=2008|title=Recognition of earthquake-related damage in archaeological sites: examples from the Dead Sea fault zone|journal=Tectonophysics|volume=453|pages=148–156|doi=10.1016/j.tecto.2007.04.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Αncient [[building]]s and other man-made structures can be studied for signs of ancient seismic disaster, often associated with [[soil]] vibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silva|first=P.G.|year=2009|title=Surface and subsurface palaeoseismic records at the ancient Roman city of Baelo Claudia and the Bolonia Bay area, Cádiz (south Spain)|journal=Geological Society of London, Special Publications|pages=93–121|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reeve and Serfs.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[harvesting]] in the August calendar page of the [[Queen Mary Psalter]] (fol. 78v), ca. 1310]]
'''August''' is the eighth month of the year in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s, and the fifth of seven months to have a length of 31 days.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/42820/August August]." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2008. [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]. 23 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally named ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]] because it was the sixth month in the original ten-month [[Roman calendar]] under [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] in 753 BC, and [[March]] was the first month of the year. About 700&amp;nbsp;BC, it became the eighth month when [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the year before March by King [[Numa Pompilius]], who also gave it 29 days. [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in 46 BC (708 AUC), giving it its modern length of 31 days. In 8 BC, it was renamed in honor of [[Augustus]]. According to a [[Senatus consultum]] quoted by [[Macrobius]], he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:id=calendarium-cn|title=Year of Julius Caesar, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1890), William Smith, LLD, William Wayte, G. E. Marindin, Ed.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], August is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. In many European countries, August is the holiday month for most workers. Numerous religious holidays occurred during August in ancient Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Supplicia canum]] was held on August 3, [[Lychnapsia]] on August 12, [[Nemoralia]] was held from August 13–15 (or on the full moon of August), [[Tiberinalia]] and [[Portunus (mythology)|Portumnalia]] on August 17, [[Consualia|Consuales Ludi]] on August 18, [[Vinalia|Vinalia rustica]] on August 19, [[Vulcan (mythology)#Vulcanalia|Vulcanalia]] on August 23, [[Opiconsivia]] on August 25, and [[Volturnalia]] on August 27. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain [[meteor shower]]s take place in August. The [[Kappa Cygnids]] take place in August, with the dates varying each year. The [[Alpha Capricornids]] meteor shower takes place as early as July 10 and ends at around August 10, and the  [[Southern Delta Aquariids]] take place from mid-July to mid-August, with the peak usually around July 28–29. The [[Perseids]], a major meteor shower, typically takes place between July 17 and August 24, with the days of the peak varying yearly. The star cluster of [[Messier 30]] is best observed around August.

Among the aborigines of the [[Canary Islands]], especially among the [[Guanches]] of [[Tenerife]], the month of August received in the name of Beñesmer or [[Beñesmen]], which was also the harvest festival held this month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abréu Galindo |first=Juan de |authorlink=Juan de Abréu Galindo |title=Historia de la conquista de las siete islas de Gran Canaria |url=http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/ref/collection/MDC/id/70784 |year=1848 |orig-year=1632 |publisher=Imprenta, Litografía y Librería Isleña |location=Santa Cruz de Tenerife}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Torriani |first=Leonardo |authorlink=Leonardo Torriani |title=Descripción e historia del reino de las Islas Canarias: antes Afortunadas, con el parecer de sus fortificaciones |url=http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/ref/collection/MDC/id/44103 |year=1959 |orig-year=1590 |publisher=Goya Ediciones |location=Santa Cruz de Tenerife}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Basil Cottle''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|FSA}} (17 March 1917 – 13 May 1994) was a British [[Grammar|grammarian]], [[historian]] and [[archaeologist]]. He lived most of his life in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name="Cheshire2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheshire|first1=Paul|title=Basil Cottle, ''Joseph Cottle and the Romantics: The Life of a Bristol Publisher'' (Review)|journal=Romanticism|volume=15|issue=2|year=2009|pages=203–205|issn=1354-991X|doi=10.3366/E1354991X0900066X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Cottle was born in [[Cardiff]] on 17 March 1917. He was the younger son of Arthur Bertram Cottle (1881-1964), a clerk, and Cecile Mary Bennett, a schoolmistress. He attended [[Howard Gardens High School|Howard Gardens Secondary School]] in Cardiff, where his precocious talents came to the notice of  Evan Frederic Morgan (1893-1949), 2nd Viscount Tredegar, Welsh poet, author, occultist and convert to Roman Catholicism, who gave Cottle the use of the extensive library at Tredegar House. A prolonged and severe bout of rheumatic fever in his early teens permanently affected his eyesight and he subsequently completely lost the sight of his right eye. Notwithstanding this disadvantage, Cottle went on to the [[University of Wales]], where he obtained a double first in English and Latin, and a second in Greek, his favourite subject. Whilst there he became a protege of Dr Victor Erle Nash-Williams (1897-1955), Keeper of the Department of Archaeology at the National Museum of Wales, and lecturer in Archaeology from whom he developed a life long interest in Roman and early Celtic Christianity and epigraphy. Cottle was encouraged by Nash-Williams to become a museum curator but he eventually trained as a schoolmaster, gaining a first in education at Cardiff, and taught at [[Cowbridge Grammar School]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-a-b-cottle-1436998.html|title=Obituary: A. B. Cottle|date=18 May 1994|work=The Independent|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second World War ==
At the outbreak of the [[Second world war|Second World War]], Cottle was judged to be medically unfit for [[active service]] and instead became a private in the [[Royal Pioneer Corps]], stationed at [[Huyton]]. Whilst serving there, in May 1941, he witnessed the [[Custom House, Liverpool|Liverpool Custom House]] burn down in a German [[Airstrike|air raid]]. Later, he was transferred to the [[Royal Army Educational Corps]] and rose to the rank of Sergeant-Major.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;In 1942 he was billeted with the Iredale family in Workington while attached to a coastal regiment of the Royal Artillery during his attachment with the AEC. Here he forged a life-long friendship with the three Iredale sisters, one of whom Hilda Queenie, published a volume on Thomas Traherne in 1935 and deepened Cottle's knowledge and appreciation of the work of the Welsh metaphysical poet, Henry Vaughan, "the Silurist". Both Traherne and Vaughan became favourite poets of Cottle's. He later taught generations of Bristol students to appreciate their works.

Eventually Cottle received a commission and was transferred to [[Bletchley Park]] in 1943, where he read decoded [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages. In 1945 he was transferred to the Albanian section of the Foreign Office during the civil war between the Zoggists and the Communists. Whilst there, he compiled an [[Albanian language]] Grammar and Syntax for use by the [[Foreign Office]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Amongst those who were transferred to his staff was the Bristol-educated linguist, Stuart Edward Mann (1905-1986), who had traveled to Albania in the 1930s, subsequently wrote a historical grammar of Albanian. Mann had a rich fund of anecdotes about the country in general, and of King Zog and his sisters in particular, whose English tutor he had been, and which Cottle frequently and dramatically recounted.

== Academic career ==
In 1946, Cottle took a position as an assistant lecturer in the department of English in the [[University of Bristol]]. In 1962, he became a [[senior lecturer]], and in 1976 a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in [[mediaeval studies]]. He taught courses on the Greek lyric, for Professor Humphrey Davy Findley Kitto, F.B.A. (1897-1982), on pre-Norman Irish art and architecture, the Anglo-Saxons,  Middle English, Names, and on the Bristol Romantics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Cottle was an expert on the writings of the "Accrington poetess", Janie Whittaker (1877-1933), and the Welsh Nonconformist minister, the Revd Henry Maurice  (1634-1682), an Independent, who had formerly held the living of Church Stretton, and whose journal for the year of Indulgence,1672, belonged to him. 

He described himself as a Welshman, an amateur herald, and an Anglican, and he was immensely proud of his Welsh roots. This led him to bequeath his extensive library to St  Woolos Cathedral , Newport, where his remains are buried.

His  students at Bristol included the novelist, Deborah Moggach, and the Middle English scholar, Thomas Lingen Burton, Emeritus-Professor of English at the University of Adelaide.

Cottle's life-long interest in [[archaeology]], led to his active involvement in the excavation of Keynsham abbey by the Bristol Folk House. He became the president of the [[Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society]] and was elected a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A fourth generation Primitive Methodist, the grandson and great-grandson of local preachers, he was confirmed into the Church in Wales in 1942 and thereafter became an active and forceful  supporter of the liturgy of the Established Church, the Book of Common Prayer, the 39 Articles, and the Authorized Version of the Bible. Successively church warden of four Bristol churches, St. Mary Redcliffe; St. Paul's (the centre of the Anglican Chaplaincy to the University); St. George's, Brandon Hill; and latterly Christ Church with St Ewen, Broad Street, he was an active member of the Bristol Diocesan Advisory Committee for the Care of Churches. He befriended numerous clergy and ordinands in the diocese, and through his roles as Sub Warden, successively at Wills Hall (1947-1948), and from 1948-1972 at Burwalls, (once the home of the tobacco baron, Sir George Wills), he was an influential figure in the lives of many generations of undergraduates.

Following his retirement in 1982 he remained active as a lecturer and reviewer, and in 1987 a group of his former colleagues and students celebrated his contribution to the study of Middle English by presenting him with a festschrift, Medieval Literature and Antiquities: Studies in Honour of Basil Cottle, edited by Myra Stokes and T.L. Burton. 

His extensive private and academic papers are held in the Special Collections of the University of Bristol,  class mark GB 3 DM 1582

'''Carlos Calvo''' (February 26, 1824, [[Buenos Aires]] – May 2, 1906, [[Paris]]) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] publicist and historian, who devoted himself to the study of the law. 

In 1860 he was sent by the [[Paraguay]]an government on a special mission to [[London]] and [[Paris]]. Remaining in France, he published in 1863 his ''Derecho internacional teórico y práctico de Europa y America'', in two volumes, and at the same time brought out a French version. The book contained the essence of what has come to be known as the [[Calvo Doctrine]]. The book immediately took rank as one of the highest modern authorities on the subject, and by 1887 the first French edition had become enlarged to six volumes. 

Calvo's next publications were of a semi-historical character. Between 1862 and 1869 he published in Spanish and French his great collection in fifteen volumes of the [[treaties]] and other diplomatic acts of the [[South America]]n republics, and between 1864 and 1875 his ''Annales historiques de la révolution de l'Amérique latine'', in five volumes. In 1884 he was one of the founders at the [[Ghent]] congress of the [[Institut de Droit International]]. In the following year he was Argentine minister at [[Berlin]], and published his ''Dictionnaire du droit international publique et privat'' in that city.

{{History Of The Cold War}}
The '''Cold War (1947–1953)''' is the period within the [[Cold War]] from the [[Truman Doctrine]] in 1947 to the conclusion of the [[Korean War]] in 1953. The [[Origins of the Cold War|Cold War emerged in Europe]] a few years after the successful US–USSR–UK coalition won [[World War II]] in Europe, and extended to 1989–91. In 1947, [[Bernard Baruch]], the multimillionaire financier and adviser to presidents from Woodrow Wilson to Harry S. Truman, coined the term “Cold War” to describe the increasingly chilly relations between two World War II Allies: the United States and the Soviet Union.

Some conflicts between the West and the USSR appeared earlier. In 1945–46 the US and UK strongly protested Soviet political takeover efforts in Eastern Europe and [[Iran crisis of 1946|Iran]], while the hunt for Soviet spies made the tensions more visible.  However historians emphasize the decisive break between the US–UK and the USSR came in 1947–48 over such issues as the [[Truman Doctrine]], the [[Marshall Plan]] and the [[Berlin Blockade]], followed by the formation of [[NATO]] in 1949.{{dubious|date=January 2018}}The Cold War took place worldwide, but it had a partially different timing  outside Europe.&lt;ref name="Westad2017"/&gt;

==Creation of the Eastern Bloc==
{{Main|Eastern Bloc}}
[[File:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|left|thumb|267px]]
During [[World War II]], the Soviet Union annexed several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] within the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]. Most of those countries had been ceded to it by the secret agreement portion of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="britannicamr"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mrtext"&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1939pact.html ''Text of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact''], executed August 23, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;   These later annexed territories include Eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|two different SSRs]]),&lt;ref name="stalinswars43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia]] (became [[Latvian SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wettig20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="senn"&gt;Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940 : revolution from above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-420-2225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]] (became [[Estonian SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="senn"/&gt; [[Lithuania]] (became [[Lithuanian SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt; part of eastern [[Finland]] (became part of the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]])&lt;ref name="ckpipe"&gt;Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York: Manchester University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7190-4201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and northern [[Romania]] (became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).&lt;ref name="stalinswars55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shirer794"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the other countries it occupied that were not directly annexed into the [[Soviet Union]] became [[Satellite state|Soviet satellite states]]. In [[East Germany]] after local election losses, a forced merger of political parties in the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party ("SED")]], followed by elections in 1946 where political opponents were oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the non-[[Soviet Union|USSR]] annexed portion of [[Poland]], less than a third of Poland's population voted in favor of massive communist land reforms and industry nationalizations&lt;ref&gt;Curp, David, ''A Clean Sweep?: The Politics of Ethnic Cleansing in Western Poland, 1945–1960'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2006, {{ISBN|1-58046-238-3}}, pages 66–69&lt;/ref&gt; in a policies referendum known as "[[Polish people's referendum, 1946|3 times YES]]" (''3 razy TAK''; ''3xTAK''), whereupon a second [[electoral fraud|vote rigged]] election was held to get the desired result.&lt;ref name="Buchanan"&gt;Tom Buchanan, ''Europe's Troubled Peace, 1945–2000: 1945–2000'', Blackwell Publishing, 2005, {{ISBN|0-631-22163-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0631221638&amp;id=zeqdrL3Wzy8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA84&amp;lpg=RA1-PA84&amp;ots=sdtzUrdhbs&amp;dq=Polish+referendum+1946+falsified&amp;sig=5einoBUu1HWsfCzOoauJcrxCTvg Google Print, p.84]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poloniatodayhistory"&gt;[http://www.poloniatoday.com/history13.htm A brief history of Poland: Chapter 13: The Post-War Years, 1945–1990] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709171352/http://www.poloniatoday.com/history13.htm |date=2011-07-09}}.

The list of world leaders at the beginning of these years are as follows:
*1947–49: [[Clement Attlee]] (UK); [[Harry Truman]] (US); [[Vincent Auriol]] (France); [[Joseph Stalin]] (USSR); [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (Allied China)
*1950–51: [[Clement Attlee]] (UK); [[Harry Truman]] (US); [[Vincent Auriol]] (France); [[Joseph Stalin]] (USSR); [[Mao Zedong]] (China)
*1952–53: [[Winston Churchill]] (UK); [[Harry Truman]] (US); [[Vincent Auriol]] (France); [[Joseph Stalin]] (USSR); [[Mao Zedong]] (China)

In [[Hungary]], when the Soviets installed a communist government, [[Mátyás Rákosi]] was appointed [[General Secretary]] of the [[Hungarian Communist Party]],&lt;ref name="sugar375"&gt;Sugar, Peter F., Peter Hanak and [[Tibor Frank]], ''A History of Hungary'', Indiana University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-253-20867-X}}, pp. 375–77&lt;/ref&gt; which began one of the harshest dictatorships in Europe&lt;ref name="granville"&gt;Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58544-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gati, Charles, ''Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest, and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt'', Stanford University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-5606-6}}, pp. 9–12&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[People's Republic of Hungary]].  In [[Bulgaria]], toward the end of World War II, the Soviet Union crossed the border and created the conditions for a communist [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944|coup d'état]] on the following night.&lt;ref name="wettig50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet military commander in Sofia assumed supreme authority, and the communists whom he instructed, including [[Kimon Georgiev]] (who was not a communist himself, but a member of the elitarian political organization "[[Zveno]]", working together with the communists), took full control of domestic politics&lt;ref name="wettig50"/&gt; in the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]].

With Soviet backing, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] assumed undisputed control over the government of Czechoslovakia in the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]], ushering in a dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp=370–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grogin|2001|pp=134–35}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Saxonberg|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Romanian general election, 1946|Romanian general election elections of 1946]], the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) employed widespread intimidation tactics and electoral fraud to obtain 80 percent of the vote and, thereafter, eliminated the role of the centrist parties and forced mergers, the result of which was that, by 1948, most non-Communist politicians were either executed, in exile or in prison. In the [[Albanian parliamentary election, 1945|December 1945 Albanian election]], the only effective ballot choices were those of the communist [[Democratic Front (Albania)]], led by [[Enver Hoxha]].&lt;ref name="cook17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2001|p=17}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cook17" /&gt; In 1946, Albania was declared the [[People's Republic of Albania]].

Initially, Stalin directed systems in the Eastern Bloc countries that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], democratic governance (dubbed "[[bourgeois democracy]]" in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.&lt;ref name="hardt12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were economically communist and depended upon the Soviet Union for significant amounts of materials.&lt;ref name="hardt15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the first five years following World War II, massive emigration from these states to the West occurred, restrictions implemented thereafter stopped most East-West migration, except that under limited bilateral and other agreements.&lt;ref name="bocker209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Böcker|1998|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Containment==
The immediate post-1945 period may have been the historical high point for the popularity of [[communism|communist]] ideology. The burdens the [[Red Army]] and the [[Soviet Union]] endured had earned it massive respect which, had it been fully exploited by [[Joseph Stalin]], had a good chance of resulting in a communist Europe. Communist parties achieved a significant popularity in such nations as [[China]], [[Greece]], [[Iran]], and the [[Republic of Mahabad]]. Communist parties had already come to power in [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Albania]], and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] were concerned that electoral victories by communist parties in any of these countries could lead to sweeping economic and political change in [[Western Europe]].

===Morgenthau and Marshall Plans===
{{Further|Morgenthau Plan|Marshall Plan|Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948}}

Having lost 27 million people in the war, the Soviet Union was determined to destroy Germany's capacity for another war, and pushed for such in wartime conferences. The resulting [[Morgenthau plan]] policy foresaw returning Germany to a pastoral state without heavy industry. Because of the increasing costs of food imports to avoid mass-starvation in Germany, and with the danger of losing the entire nation to communism, the U.S. government abandoned the Morgenthau plan in September 1946 with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]]' speech [[Restatement of Policy on Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gimbel]] [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2147827 "''On the Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement: An Essay on U.S. Postwar German Policy"''] Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 87, No. 2. (Jun., 1972), pp. 242–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1947, Truman appointed General [[George Marshall]] as Secretary of State, and enacted JCS 1779, which decreed that an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany."&lt;ref name="beschloss277"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beschloss|2003|p=277}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive comported with the view of  General [[Lucius D. Clay]] and the [[Joint Chief of Staff]] over growing communist influence in [[Germany]], as well as of the failure of the rest of the European economy to recover without the German industrial base on which it previously had been dependent. Administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="miller16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six weeks of negotiations, Molotov refused the demands and the talks were adjourned.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt; Marshall was particularly discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin, who expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt; The United States concluded that a solution could not wait any longer.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt;  In a June 5, 1947 speech,&lt;ref name="marshallspeech"&gt;Marshall, George C, ''[[s:The Marshall Plan Speech|The Marshal Plan Speech]]'', June 5, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; comporting with the [[Truman Doctrine]], Marshall announced a comprehensive program of American assistance to all European countries wanting to participate, including the Soviet Union and those of Eastern Europe, called the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt;

Fearing American political, cultural and economic penetration, Stalin eventually forbade Soviet [[Eastern bloc]] countries of the newly formed [[Cominform]] from accepting [[Marshall Plan]] aid.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt; In [[Czechoslovakia]], that required a Soviet-backed [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]],&lt;ref name=trueye&gt;''Airbridge to Berlin'', "Eye of the Storm" chapter&lt;/ref&gt;   the brutality of which shocked Western powers more than any event so far and set in a motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.&lt;ref name="miller19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Greek Civil War and the Truman Doctrine===
{{Main|Truman Doctrine|Greek Civil War}}
[[File:Αντάρτες του ΕΑΜ-ΕΛΑΣ.jpg|thumb|200px|Guerillas of [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]]]]
Both East and West regarded [[Greece]] as a nation well within the [[sphere of influence]] of Britain. Stalin had respected the "[[percentages agreement]]" with Winston Churchill to not intervene, but Yugoslavia and Albania defied the USSR's policy and sent supplies during the [[Greek Civil War]] to the army of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], the [[Democratic Army of Greece|DSE]] (Democratic Army of Greece). The UK had given aid to the royalist Greek forces, leaving the Communists (without Soviet aid and having boycotted the elections)  at a disadvantaged position. However, by 1947, the near-bankrupt British government could no longer maintain its massive overseas commitments. In addition to granting [[Partition of India|independence to India]] and handing back the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestinian Mandate]] to the [[United Nations]], the British government decided to withdraw from both Greece and nearby Turkey. This would have left the two nations, in particular Greece, on the brink of a communist-led revolution.

Notified that British aid to Greece and Turkey would end in less than six weeks, and already hostile towards and suspicious of Soviet intentions, because of their [[Iran crisis of 1946|reluctance to withdraw from Iran]], the Truman administration decided that additional action was necessary.  With [[United States Congress|Congress]] solidly in [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] hands, and with [[isolationism|isolationist]] sentiment strong among the U.S. public, Truman adopted an ideological approach. In a meeting with congressional leaders, the argument of "apples in a barrel infected by one rotten one" was used to convince them of the significance in supporting Greece and Turkey. It was to become the "[[domino theory]]". On the morning of March 12, 1947, President [[Harry S. Truman]] appeared before Congress to ask for $400 million of aid to Greece and Turkey. Calling on congressional approval for the United States to "support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures," or in short a policy of "[[containment]]", Truman articulated a presentation of the ideological struggle that became known as the "Truman Doctrine." Although based on a simplistic analysis of internal strife in Greece and Turkey, it became the single dominating influence over U.S. policy until at least the [[Vietnam War]].

Truman's speech had a tremendous effect. The anti-communist feelings that had just begun to hatch in the U.S. were given a great boost, and a silenced Congress voted overwhelmingly in approval of aid. The United States would not withdraw back to the [[Western Hemisphere]] as it had after [[World War I]]. From then on, the U.S. actively fought communist advances anywhere in the globe under the ostensible causes of "freedom", "democracy" and "human rights." The U.S. brandished its role as the leader of the "free world." Meanwhile, the Soviet Union brandished its position as the leader of the "progressive" and "anti-imperialist" camp.

===''Nazi–Soviet relations'' and ''Falsifiers of History''===
{{Main|Falsifiers of History}}
Relations further deteriorated when, in January 1948, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] also published a collection of documents titled ''Nazi–Soviet Relations, 1939–1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'', which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name="henig67" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="roberts97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=97}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement]],&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=32–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[German–Soviet Axis talks|discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchill|1953|pp=512–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, one month later, the Soviet Union published ''[[Falsifiers of History]]'', a Stalin edited and partially re-written book attacking the West.&lt;ref name="henig67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Henig|2005|p=67}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=96}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book did not attempt to directly counter or deal with the documents published in ''Nazi-Soviet Relations''&lt;ref name="roberts100"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=100}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rather, focused upon Western culpability for the outbreak of war in 1939.&lt;ref name="roberts97" /&gt; It argues that "Western powers" aided Nazi rearmament and aggression, including that American bankers and industrialists provided capital for the growth of German war industries, while deliberately encouraging Hitler to expand eastward.&lt;ref name="henig67" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts97" /&gt; The book also included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's offer to share in a division of the world, without mentioning [[German–Soviet Axis talks|the Soviet offers to join the Axis]].&lt;ref name="nekrich202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union used that depiction of events [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|until the Soviet Union's dissolution]].&lt;ref name="nekrich202" /&gt;

===Berlin Blockade===
[[File:C-54landingattemplehof.jpg|thumb|Berliners watching a C-54 land at Tempelhof Airport (1948)]]
{{Main|Berlin Blockade}}
After the [[Marshall Plan]], the introduction of a new currency to Western Germany to replace the debased [[Reichsmark]] and massive electoral losses for communist parties in 1946, in June 1948, the Soviet Union cut off surface road access to [[Berlin]]. On the day of the Berlin Blockade, a Soviet representative told the other occupying powers  "We are warning both you and the population of Berlin that we shall apply economic and administrative sanctions that will lead to circulation in Berlin exclusively of the currency of the Soviet occupation zone."&lt;ref name="miller32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, street and water communications were severed, rail and barge traffic was stopped and the Soviets initially stopped supplying food to the civilian population in the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin.&lt;ref name="miller25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=25–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Berlin was located within the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the other occupying powers had previously relied on Soviet good will for access to Berlin, the only available methods of supplying the city were three limited air corridors.&lt;ref name="miller6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 1948, because of massive post-war military cuts, the entire United States army had been reduced to 552,000 men.&lt;ref name="miller28"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Military forces in non-Soviet Berlin sectors totaled only 8,973 Americans, 7,606 British and 6,100 French.&lt;ref name="miller33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soviet military forces in the Soviet sector that surrounded Berlin totaled one and a half million men.&lt;ref name="miller30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two United States regiments in Berlin would have provided little resistance against a Soviet attack.&lt;ref name="miller29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that Britain, France and the United States had little option other than to acquiesce, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany celebrated the beginning of the blockade.&lt;ref name="miller35"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, a massive aerial supply campaign of food, water and other goods was initiated by the United States, Britain, France and other countries.&lt;ref name=mac&gt;''MAC and the Legacy of the Berlin Airlift''&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets derided "the futile attempts of the Americans to save face and to maintain their untenable position in Berlin."&lt;ref name=indiana&gt;[http://www.indianamilitary.org/ATTERBURYAAF/History/BerlinAirlift.html ''Fifty years ago, a massive airlift into Berlin showed the Soviets that a post-WW II blockade would not work''], C.V. Glines&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the airlift eventually caused the Soviets to lift their blockade in May 1949.

===Tito–Stalin Split===
{{Further|Tito–Stalin Split}}
After disagreements between Yugoslavian leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] and the Soviet Union regarding Greece and the [[People's Republic of Albania]], a [[Tito–Stalin Split]] occurred, followed by Yugoslavia being expelled from the [[Cominform]] in June 1948 and a brief failed Soviet putsch in Belgrade.&lt;ref name="wettig156"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The split created two separate communist forces in Europe.&lt;ref name="wettig156"/&gt;  A vehement campaign against "Titoism" was immediately started in the Eastern Bloc, describing agents of both the West and Tito in all places engaging in subversive activity.&lt;ref name="wettig156"/&gt; This resulted in the persecution of many major party cadres, including those in East Germany.&lt;ref name="wettig157"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO===
[[File:Nato 1970.jpg|thumb|right|[[NATO]] v. the [[Warsaw Pact]]]]
The United States joined Britain, France, Canada, Denmark, Portugal, Norway, Belgium, Iceland, Luxembourg, Italy, and the Netherlands in 1949 to form the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the United States' first "entangling" European alliance in 170 years. West Germany, Spain, Greece, and Turkey would later join this alliance. The Eastern leaders retaliated against these steps by integrating the economies of their nations in [[Comecon]], their version of the [[Marshall Plan]]; exploding the first Soviet [[nuclear weapon|atomic device]] in 1949; signing an alliance with [[People's Republic of China]] in February 1950; and forming the [[Warsaw Pact]], Eastern Europe's counterpart to NATO, in 1955. The Soviet Union, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland founded this military alliance.

===NSC 68===
U.S. officials quickly moved to escalate and expand "containment." In a secret 1950 document, [[NSC 68]], they proposed to strengthen their alliance systems, quadruple defense spending, and embark on an elaborate propaganda campaign to convince the U.S. public to fight this costly cold war. Truman ordered the development of a [[hydrogen bomb]]. In early 1950, the U.S. took its first efforts to oppose communist forces in Vietnam; planned to form a West German army, and prepared proposals for a peace treaty with Japan that would guarantee long-term U.S. military bases there.

==Outside Europe==
The Cold War took place worldwide, but it had a partially different timing and trajectory outside Europe.&lt;ref name="Westad2017"&gt;Odd Arne Westad, ''The Cold War: A World History'' (Penguin UK, 2017)  pp. 2–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, decolonization took place first; it was largely accomplished in the 1950s. The main rivals then sought bases of support in the new national political alignments.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Meriwether, “Endangering the Security of the Free World: Africa, the United States, and the Cold War,” ''New England Journal of History'' 64 (2007), pp. 90–101.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Latin America, the first major confrontation took place in Guatemala in 1954.  When the new Castro government of Cuba turned to Soviets support in 1960, Cuba became the center of the anti-American Cold War forces, supported by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Immerman, "Guatemala as Cold War History," ''Political Science Quarterly'' 95#3 (1980-81): 629-653. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2150608 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester Langley, ed. ''The United States, Cuba, and the Cold War; American Failure Or Communist Conspiracy?'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese Civil War===
{{Main|Chinese Civil War}}
As Japan collapsed in 1945 the civil war resumed in China between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) led by Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]]. The USSR had signed a Treaty of Friendship with the Kuomintang in 1945 and disavowed support for the Chinese Communists. The outcome was closely fought, with the Communists finally prevailing with superior military tactics. Although the Nationalists had an advantage in numbers of men and weapons, initially controlled a much larger territory and population than their adversaries, and enjoyed considerable international support, they were exhausted by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|long war with Japan]] and the attendant internal responsibilities. In addition, the Chinese Communists were able to fill the political vacuum left in [[Manchuria]] after Soviet forces withdrew from the area and thus gained China's prime industrial base. The Chinese Communists were able to fight their way from the north and northeast, and virtually all of [[mainland China]] was taken by the end of 1949. On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Chiang Kai-shek and 600,000 Nationalist troops and 2 million refugees, predominantly from the government and business community, fled from the mainland to the island of [[Taiwan]]. In December 1949, Chiang proclaimed [[Taipei]] the temporary capital of the Republic of China (ROC) and continued to assert his government as the sole legitimate authority in China.

The continued hostility between the Communists on the mainland and the Nationalists on Taiwan continued throughout the Cold War. Though the United States refused to aide Chiang Kai-shek in his hope to "recover the mainland," it continued supporting the Republic of China with military supplies and expertise to prevent Taiwan from falling into PRC hands. Through the support of the Western bloc (most Western countries continued to recognize the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China), the Republic of China on Taiwan retained [[China and the United Nations|China's seat in the United Nations]] until 1971.

==Korean War==
[[File:Truman initiating Korean involvement.jpg|thumb|right|200px|President Truman signing a proclamation declaring a national emergency that initiates U.S. involvement in the Korean War.]]
{{Main|Korean War}}
In early 1950, the United States made its first commitment to form a peace treaty with Japan that would guarantee long-term U.S. military bases. Some observers (including [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]) believed that the Japanese treaty led Stalin to approve a plan to invade U.S.-supported [[South Korea]] on June 25, 1950. [[Korea]] had been divided at the end of World War II along the 38th parallel into Soviet and U.S. occupation zones, in which a communist government was installed in the [[North Korea|North]] by the Soviets, and an elected government in the South came to power after UN-supervised elections in 1948.

In June 1950, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s [[Korean People's Army|North Korean People's Army]] invaded South Korea.&lt;ref name="Stokesbury1990"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Short History of the Korean War|last=Stokesbury |first= James L|year= 1990|publisher=Harper Perennial |location= New York|isbn= 0-688-09513-5|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fearing that communist Korea under a Kim Il Sung dictatorship could threaten Japan  and foster other communist movements in Asia, Truman committed U.S. forces and obtained help from the [[United Nations]] to counter the North Korean invasion. The Soviets boycotted [[UN Security Council]] meetings while protesting the Council's failure to seat the [[People's Republic of China]] and, thus, did not veto the Council's approval of UN action to oppose the North Korean invasion. A joint UN force of personnel from South Korea, the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Turkey]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[France]], the [[Philippines]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[New Zealand]] and other countries joined to stop the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Fehrenbach, T.

Truman faced a hostile China, a Sino-Soviet partnership, and a defense budget that had quadrupled in eighteen months.

The [[Korean Armistice Agreement]] was signed in July 1953 after the death of Stalin, who had been insisting that the North Koreans continue fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Byrd, Peter|editor1=McLean, Iain |editor2=McMillan, Alistair |encyclopedia=The concise Oxford dictionary of politics|title=Cold War (entire chapter)|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xLbEHQAACAAJ|accessdate=2008-06-16|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280276-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In North Korea, Kim Il-sung created a highly centralized and brutal [[dictatorship]], according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable [[cult of personality]].&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorfer, Don, ''The two Koreas: a contemporary history'', Basic Books, 2001, {{ISBN|0-465-05162-6}}, page 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;No, Kum-Sok and  J.

==Hydrogen bomb==
A [[hydrogen bomb]]—which produced [[nuclear fusion]] instead of [[nuclear fission]]—was first tested by the United States in November 1952 and the Soviet Union in August 1953.  Such bombs were first deployed in the 1960s.

==Culture and media==
[[File:DuckandCover.jpg|thumb|right|The title screen from ''Duck and Cover''.]]

{{unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
Fear of a nuclear war spurred the production of public safety films by the [[Federal Government of the United States|United States federal government's]] [[Civil Defense]] branch that demonstrated ways on protecting oneself from a Soviet nuclear attack.  The 1951 children's film ''[[Duck and Cover (film)|Duck and Cover]]'' is a prime example.

George Orwell's classic dystopia [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] was published in 1949. The novel explores life in an imagined future world where a totalitarian government has achieved terrifying levels of power and control. With Nineteen Eighty-Four, Orwell taps into the anti-communist fears that would continue to haunt so many in the West for decades to come. In a Cold War setting his descriptions could hardly fail to evoke comparison to Soviet communism and the seeming willingness of Stalin and his successors to control those within the Soviet bloc by whatever means necessary. Orwell's famous allegory of totalitarian rule, [[Animal Farm]], published in 1945, provoked similar anti-communist sentiments.

==Significant documents==
The Cold War generated innumerable documents.  The texts of 171 documents appear in ''The Encyclopedia of the Cold War'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Mary Roberts, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of the Cold War:  A Political, Social, and Military History: Volume 5: Documents'' (2008).  isbn 978-1-85109-701-2&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Baruch Plan]]: 1946. A proposal by the U.S. to the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]] (UNAEC) to a) extend between all nations the exchange of basic scientific information for peaceful ends; b) implement control of atomic  energy to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes; c) eliminate from national armaments atomic weapons and all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction; and d) establish effective safeguards by way of inspection and other means to protect complying States against the hazards of violations and evasions. When the Soviet Union was the only member state which refused to sign, the U.S. embarked on a massive nuclear weapons testing, development, and deployment program.
*The Long Telegram and The "[[X Article]]", 1946–1947. Formally titled "''The Sources of Soviet Conduct''". The article describes the concepts that became the foundation of United States Cold War policy and was published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' in 1947. The article was an expansion of a well-circulated top secret [[United States Department of State|State Department]] cable called the X Article and became famous for setting forth the doctrine of containment. Though the article was signed [[pseudonym]]ously by "X," it was well known at the time that the true author was [[George F. Kennan]], the deputy chief of mission of the United States to the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1946, under [[ambassador]] [[W. Averell Harriman]].
*[[NSC 68]]: April 14, 1950. A [[classified information|classified]] report written and issued by the [[United States National Security Council]]. The report outlined the [[National Security Strategy of the United States]] for that time and provided a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of the Soviet Union and of the United States from military, economic, political, and psychological standpoints. NSC{{nbsp}}68's principal thesis was that the Soviet Union intended to become the single dominant world power. The report argued that the Soviet Union had a systematic strategy aimed at the spread of communism across the entire world, and it recommended that the United States government adopt a policy of containment to stop the further spread of Soviet power. NSC{{nbsp}}68 outlined a drastic [[foreign policy]] shift from defensive to active containment and advocated aggressive military preparedness. NSC{{nbsp}}68 shaped government actions in the Cold War for the next 20 years and has subsequently been labeled the "blueprint" for the Cold War.
*Speech by [[James F. Byrnes]],  [[United States Secretary of State]] "''[[Restatement of Policy on Germany]]''" [[Stuttgart]] September 6, 1946.  Also known as the "''Speech of hope,''" it set the tone of future U.S. policy as it repudiated the [[Morgenthau Plan]] economic policies and gave the Germans hope for the future. The Western powers worst fear was that the poverty and hunger would drive the Germans to communism. General [[Lucius D. Clay|Lucius Clay]] stated "There is no choice between being a communist on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on a thousand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=aEzVNpVqENYC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=%22There+is+no+choice+between+being+a+communist+on+1,500+calories+a+day+and+a+believer+in+democracy+on+a+thousand%22+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BLqGX6hvRq&amp;sig=rhtHtmUCWyjw_4mh_6nMPORh0DA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibqOKnqObaAhVMJpQKHYjYCTMQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22There+is+no+choice+between+being+a+communist+on+1,500+calories+a+day+and+a+believer+in+democracy+on+a+thousand%22+-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=The European Union|publisher=PediaPress|accessdate=2 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was also seen as a stand against the Soviet Union because it stated the firm intention of the United States to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely. But the heart of the message was as Byrnes stated a month later "The nub of our program was to win the German people ... it was a battle between us and Russia over minds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=1nAOuIXD5r0C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=%22The+nub+of+our+program+was+to+win+the+German+people%22+%22it+was+a+battle+between+us+and+Russia+over+minds%22+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XlrQfU817x&amp;sig=JzbElJDapY6HfMTJCijcyxxxIg8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiG28T3p-baAhVQ1mMKHZY0B1cQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The+nub+of+our+program+was+to+win+the+German+people%22+%22it+was+a+battle+between+us+and+Russia+over+minds%22&amp;f=false|title=United States History - Part B|publisher=PediaPress|accessdate=2 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand language|topic=|langcode=it|otherarticle=Corteo Storico Matildico|date=August 2013}}

'''Corteo Storico Matildico''' is a reminiscent event of historical nature, which takes place annually in [[Quattro Castella]], in the province of [[Reggio Emilia]], since 1955.

== The Coronation ==

The event takes place generally on the last Sunday in May and recalls the episode of the coronation of [[Matilda of Canossa]] at the hands of [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], occurred at the foot of the [[Castello di Bianello|Castle of Bianello]] between 6 and 10 of May of the year 1111.

The Emperor was the son of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] who, 30 years before, obtained from [[Pope Gregory VII]], through the mediation of Matilde, the “''forgiveness of Canossa''”. ''Donizone from Canossa'', Matilda’s biographer and chronicler of that time, says that the Emperor reached the [[Castello di Bianello|Castle of Bianello]] when back from [[Rome]] and he crowned the Grand Duchess with the title of "''Imperial Vicar Vice-Queen of Italy''". This episode was the decisive step towards the [[Concordat of Worms]]. Historical sources report that the ceremony took place in the churchyard of the ''St Antonino Church'', not far from where the event is currently taking place.

== The Show ==

The show is the theatrical re-enactment of the historical episode, with the figure of '''Matilda''' and of the Emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], commonly interpreted  by known figures from the entertainment, culture and sport. The event has traditionally different medieval shows:

* '''The performances of the flag-wavers and musicians’ districts of [[Quattro Castella]]''': (''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130615182603/http://www.contradamonticelli.com/Home/ Contrada di Monticelli], [http://contradafriends.weebly.com/ Contrada della Corte], [http://www.maestadellabattaglia.it/ Contrada della Maestà della Battaglia])
* '''The parades and performances of the main historical groups of [[Quattro Castella]]''': (''Contrada di Borgoleto, Gruppo Storico dei Villici, [http://www.arcieri4castella.it/ Gruppo Storico Arcieri delle Quattro Castella]'')
* '''The Quintana Ring''': it is a game of skill for knights. Participants must be able to fit with the spear while riding rings, which become gradually smaller.
* The “'''Gran Passo d’Armi'''”, otherwise known as "''the Bridge Game''" or "the ''Fight of the Bridge''": Two teams of 7 fighters face in a duel over a wooden bridge. The team that manages to bring down all the members of the opposing team from the bridge, leaving at least one of its members still on, is the winner

== Curiosity ==

'''Corteo Storico Matildico''' takes its name from the final ''parade'' (the translation of "parade" in Italian is "corteo") of more than 1.000 figures in the period costume, along the streets of [[Quattro Castella]].

The event is currently organized by the '''Municipality of Quattro Castella''', by a committee of volunteers known as the "''Matildic Committee''". In the editions prior to 1984 it was organized by the ''Pro Loco of Quattro Castella''.

The historical parade was interrupted only once in its history from 1972 to 1984, the year in which it has been restarted.

She placed ninth in 2017 and fifth in 2018.&lt;ref name="Stuff-duel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/96433308/full-contact-medieval-combat-has-axes-swinging-in-hamilton|title=Full contact medieval combat has axes swinging in Hamilton|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Victorious"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuff-hospital"/&gt; 

She also participated in the Battle of Nations tournament near [[Rome]], as a solo fighter and as part of a five-person melee team.&lt;ref name="Stuff-duel" /&gt; While fighting in the Battle of Nations, she was briefly hospitalised with a migraine and temporary partial loss of sight.&lt;ref name="Stuff-hospital"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gattey |first1=Megan |title=Kiwi hospitalised after fighting in Battle of the Nations medieval battle near Rome |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/103741270/kiwi-hospitalised-after-fighting-in-battle-of-the-nations-medieval-battle-near-rome?rm=m |accessdate=25 September 2018 |work=Stuff |date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In New Zealand, Berghan-Whyman frequently fights male opponents, as there are few women in medieval combat. She qualified to represent New Zealand by fighting two male opponents at the New Zealand Full Contact Medieval Combat Pacific Cup.&lt;ref name="Wireless"/&gt; 

As a melee fighter she takes the '[[Tank (gaming)|tank]]' position, soaking up damage and distracting opponents while more lightly-armoured teammates attempt to score hits.&lt;ref name="Stuff-duel" /&gt;

==Career and personal life==
Berghan-Whyman was Women's Rights Officer of the [[Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association]] in 2000&lt;ref name="Salient"&gt;{{cite news |title=Reclaim the Night |url=http://salient.org.nz/2006/10/reclaim-the-night/ |accessdate=25 September 2018 |work=Salient}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and National Women's Rights Officer of the [[New Zealand Union of Students' Associations]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="NZUSA"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Women and NZUSA 1970-2003 |url=http://www.students.org.nz/history_of_women_and_nzusa |website=NZ Union of Students' Associations |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=August 2018}}
A '''double plural''' is a [[plural form]] to which an extra [[suffix]] has been added, mainly because the original plural suffix (or other variation) had become [[productivity (linguistics)|unproductive]] and therefore irregular. So the form as a whole was no longer seen as a plural, an instance of [[morphological leveling]].

Examples of this can be seen in the history of [[English language|English]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Historically, the general English plural markers were not only ''-s'' or ''-en'' but also (in certain specific declensions) ''-ra''/''-ru'' (which is still rather general today in [[German language|German]] under the form ''-er''). The ancient plural of ''child'' was "cildra/cildru", to which an ''-en'' suffix was later added when the ''-ra''/''-ru'' became unproductive; the Dutch plural form ''kind-er-en'' and the corresponding [[Zeelandic]] form ''kind-er-s'' are also double plurals which were formed in the same way as the English double plurals, while for example German and [[Limburgian]] have (historically conservative) single plurals such as ''Kind-er''.

''Breeches'' is an example involving an old plural that did not use a suffix. It was formerly ''breech'' which came from Old English ''brec'' which was the plural of ''broc''.

'''Geospeedometry''' is the science of measuring the timescales and/or temperatures of thermal events in the history of a [[metamorphic]] or [[Igneous rock|igneous]] rock using diffusion profiles of elements within individual minerals. "''Geospeedometry"'' refers to the ''speed'', or timescale, of thermal events in geologic materials.  The term first appeared in the literature in 1983;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-5587-1_3|title=Kinetics and Equilibrium in Mineral Reactions|last=Lasaga|first=Antonio C.|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781461255895|editor-last=Saxena|editor-first=Surendra K.|series=Advances in Physical Geochemistry|pages=81–114|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-5587-1_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior [[Thermochronology|thermochronometric]] studies focused on diffusion of [[iron]] and [[magnesium]] in [[olivine]] provided the foundation for the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buening|first=D.

== Diffusion Theory ==
{{See also|Fick's laws of diffusion}}
Geospeedometry makes use of the temperature dependence of the chemical [[diffusion]] of elements between zones of a mineral grain.  According to [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's second law]], the concentration of an element in one dimension across a diffusive interface is given by the [[partial differential equation]]

&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{\partial}\!C\over\operatorname{\partial}\!t} = D {\operatorname{\partial^2}\!C\over\operatorname{\partial}\!x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* '''''D''''' is the diffusion coefficient, or ''[[Mass diffusivity|diffusivity]]'' (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the element in the medium&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
*'''''x''''' is the position (length)
*'''''t''''' is time 
*'''''C''''' is the concentration of the element; ''C(x,t)'' is a function dependent on both length and time.

For a one-dimensional interface at ''x ='' 0 with a fixed concentration '''''C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''',''

&lt;math&gt;C \left(x,t \right)=C_0 \mathrm{erfc} \left( \frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''erfc'' is the [[complementary error function]].

The diffusivity of an element in a medium is given by the temperature-dependent [[Arrhenius equation]]

&lt;math&gt;D = D_0 e^{-E_A/RT}&lt;/math&gt;

where
*'''''D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is the maximum diffusivity at infinite temperature; also known as the pre-exponential factor (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
*'''''E&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is the [[activation energy]] for diffusivity (J mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; )
*'''''R''''' is the [[gas constant]] (J mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
*'''''T''''' is absolute temperature (K)

Given an experimentally determined '''''D&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' for a given element in a given substance, an empirical diffusion profile can be used to calculate the peak temperature or duration of a thermal pulse experienced by the substance.

== Methodology ==
[[File:Geospeedometry diffusion illustration.pdf|thumb|Schematic illustration of an initially sharp concentration gradient between mineral growth zones (blue dashed line) and subsequent measured diffusive  gradient (red lines).]]Geologists apply diffusion theory to natural minerals in order to understand the thermal histories of igneous and metamorphic systems.  Diffusion profiles of a given element are measured between growth zones of a single mineral, or at the interface between two different minerals.  In order to measure a diffusion profile in a single crystal, geologists measure one-dimesional transects using high spatial resolution instruments such as the [[scanning electron microscope]], [[electron microprobe]], [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] or [[nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry]].

== Limitations ==
Because the solution to the diffusion equation requires a knowledge of both temperature and time duration of a thermal event, one must be independently constrained in order to measure the other.  In geologic systems, neither the temperature nor time duration of thermal events is known [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]].  An independent [[Geothermobarometry|geothermometer]] must be used to constrain peak temperature in order to use geospeedometry to calculate the duration of a thermal pulse.  Conversely, the duration of heating must be constrained independently using [[geochronology]] to estimate maximum temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barboni|first=Mélanie|last2=Boehnke|first2=Patrick|last3=Schmitt|first3=Axel K.|last4=Harrison|first4=T.

'''Giulio Carlo Argan''' (17 May 1909 – 12 November 1992) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[art historian]] and [[politician]].

==Biography==
Argan was born in [[Turin]] and studied in the [[University of Turin]], graduating in 1931. In 1928 he entered the [[Partito Nazional Fascista|National Fascist Party]]. In the 1930 he worked for the National Antiquity and Arts Directorate, first in Turin and then in [[Modena]] and [[Rome]], where he collaborated to the creation of the [[Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro]] and directed the magazine ''Le Arti''. His career was boosted by the friendship of the Fascist leader [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]], then national Minister of Education.

In 1938 he published a manual of art for  high schools, while in the 1940s he collaborated to the magazine ''Primato'', founded and directed by [[Giuseppe Bottai]], another Fascist ''[[gerarca]]''. After [[World War II]], he taught in universities [[Palermo]] and, from 1959, in Rome. Argan  co-founded the publishing house [[Il Saggiatore]] and he was a member of the Superior Council of Antiquities and Fine Arts (predecessor of the Ministry of Culture), in which he remained until 1974. In 1968 he published his most famous work, ''Storia dell'Arte Italiana'' (History of Italian Art). In 1973 he founded the Rome [[Istituto superiore per le industrie artistiche (ISIA)|ISIA]], Italy's oldest institution in the field of [[industrial design]].

He was the first [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] [[mayor of Rome]], between 1976 and 1979. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Rome]].

[[File:Norges kongesagaer-Tittelblad 1914-utgave-G. Munthe.jpg|thumb| ''Norges kongesagaer'' translated by Gustav Storm and [[Alexander Bugge]], illustrated by [[Gerhard Munthe]]]]

'''Gustav Storm''' (18 June 1845 &amp;ndash; 23 February 1903) was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[historian]], a professor at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] in [[Oslo|Christiania]] from 1877. He was a driving force in the research of [[Scandinavian history]] and literature of the [[Middle Ages]].

==Personal life==
Storm was born in [[Rendalen]], [[Hedmark]], as the son of Ole Johan Storm and Hanna Jørgine Mathilde Breda. The family moved to [[Lardal]], [[Vestfold]], where his father was a [[vicar]]. When Gustav was five years old, his father died, and the family subsequently moved to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo). He was a brother of linguist [[Johan Storm]] and a cousin of zoologist [[Vilhelm Storm]]. He died at [[Bygdøy]] in 1903.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Gustav Storm |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Ottar |last=Dahl |authorlink=Ottar Dahl|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Gustav_Storm/utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Storm [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in 1862. He studied [[philology]] at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] in Christiania, graduating as [[cand.philol.]] in 1868.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He then worked as teacher for some years, and also carried out research in the fields philology and history. Among his works were ''Snorre Sturlassøns Historieskrivning, en kritisk Undersøgelse'' from 1873, and his thesis ''Sagnkredsene om Karl den Store og Didrik af Bern hos de nordiske Folk'' from 1874.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He was appointed professor of history in 1877.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Gustav Storm |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://www.snl.no/Gustav_Storm |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Storm became a central person in history research and education at the university.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; He is regarded one of the most important investigators of [[primary sources]] in the science of [[history]] in Norway.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; He chaired the society for primary sources, ''Kildeskriftforeningen'', from 1886 to 1903, and the [[Norwegian Historical Association]] from 1899 to 1903. He was secretary general of the learned society, the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] from 1884 to 1903. His translation of ''[[Heimskringla]]'' into [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] in the late 1890s was the basis for a popular edition of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s work.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; Among his publications are treatments of the [[Battle of Hafrsfjord]], studies of [[Norsemen]]'s travels to [[Vinland]], and [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]' discovery of the American continent.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Storm was decorated Knight, First Class of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] in 1891, and Commander, First Class in 1901. He was a Commander, Second Class of the Spanish [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]], and Knight of the Swedish [[Order of the Polar Star]].&lt;ref name=stolav&gt;{{cite book |title=Den kongelige norske Sankt Olavs Orden |first=O.

The '''High Arctic relocation''' ([[French language|French]]: ''La délocalisation du Haut-Arctique'', [[Inuktitut syllabics]]: ᖁᑦᑎᒃᑐᒥᐅᑦᑕ ᓅᑕᐅᓂᖏᑦ [[Inuktitut]]: ''Quttiktumut nuutauningit''&lt;ref name="refRomani"&gt;ᕉᒪᓂ ᒪᒃᑭᒃ  Romani Makkik (2009), [http://www.tunngavik.com/documents/publications/Naniiliqpita%20Fall%202009.pdf ᖁᑦᑎᒃᑐᒥᐅᑦᑕ ᓅᑕᐅᓂᖏᑦ The High Arctic Relocations], ᓇᓃᓕᖅᐱᑕ Naniiliqpita, fall 2009&lt;/ref&gt;) took place during the [[Cold War]] in the 1950s, when 87 [[Inuit]] were moved by the [[Government of Canada]] to the High [[Arctic]].&lt;ref name=report&gt;''The High Arctic Relocation: A Report on the 1953–55 Relocation'' by René Dussault and George Erasmus, produced by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, published by Canadian Government Publishing, 1994 (190 pages){{cite web|url=http://www.fedpubs.com/subject/aborig/arctic_reloc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001232453/http://www.fedpubs.com/subject/aborig/arctic_reloc.htm |archivedate=1 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="porteous"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Porteous|first=John Douglas|author2=Smith, Sandra Eileen|title=Domicide: The Global Destruction of Home|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=2001|pages=102–03 |isbn=978-0-7735-2258-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6t_KSirfEnsC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=High+Arctic+relocation&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U1uYljO3npFHZB_oRhBrDOCNWN17Q#PPA102,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relocation has been a source of controversy: on one hand being described as a humanitarian gesture to save the lives of starving [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous people]] and enable them to continue a [[Hunter-gatherer|subsistence]] lifestyle; and on the other hand, said to be a [[Forced displacement|forced migration]] instigated by the federal government to assert its sovereignty in the Far North by the use of "human flagpoles",&lt;ref name=Pope/&gt; in light of both the Cold War and the [[Territorial claims in the Arctic|disputed territorial]] claims to the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]]. Both sides acknowledge that the relocated Inuit were not given sufficient support to prevent extreme [[privation]] during their first years after the move. The story was the subject of a book called ''The Long Exile'', published by [[Melanie McGrath]] in 2006.

==History==
[[File:Can high arctic relocation.svg|thumb|Relocation from [[Inukjuak]] to [[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]] (left arrow) and [[Grise Fiord]] (right arrow)]]
In August 1953, seven or eight families from [[Inukjuak]], [[Nunavik|northern Quebec]] (then known as Port Harrison) were transported to [[Grise Fiord]] on the southern tip of [[Ellesmere Island]] and to [[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]] on [[Cornwallis Island (Nunavut)|Cornwallis Island]].&lt;ref name="porteous"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tester102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html Grise Fiord history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228115824/http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html |date=28 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group included the family of writer [[Markoosie Patsauq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iqqaumavara.com/en/familles/entrevues/markoosie-patsauq-son-histoire/ "Markoosie Patsauq – His Story"]. ''Iqqaumavara'' (dir. [[Marquise Lepage]]), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The families, who had been receiving welfare payments, were promised better living and hunting opportunities in new communities in the High Arctic.&lt;ref name="gibney"&gt;{{Cite book|last=James |first=Matt| editor=Mark Gibney, Rhoda E.

The government stated that volunteer families had agreed to participate in  a program to reduce areas of perceived [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and poor hunting in Northern Quebec, to reduce their dependency on welfare, and to resume a [[Subsistence economy|subsistence]] lifestyle.&lt;ref name="porteous"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gibney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="damas"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Damas|first=David|title=Arctic Migrants/Arctic Villagers: The Transformation of Inuit Settlement in the Central Arctic|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|year=2004|pages=52–57|isbn=978-0-7735-2405-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TZHXQaFk2IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA52&amp;dq=High+Arctic+relocation&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3cos0KzJW12sNWI22wOdW1LHtFWg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Inuit reported that the [[population transfer|relocations were forced]] and were motivated by a desire to reinforce Canadian sovereignty in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]] by creating settlements in the area.&lt;ref name="tester102"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tester|first=Frank J.|author2=Kulchyski |others= Peter|title=Tammarniit (Mistakes): Inuit relocation in the eastern arctic 1939–63|publisher=UBC Press|location= Vancouver, BC|year=1994|pages=102–104|isbn=978-0-7748-0452-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVf9N3jdsp4C&amp;pg=PA401&amp;dq=high+arctic+relocation&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3nPPvRMCsN3_S7Nsd49GJv2x5XeQ#PPA102,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="loub"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Loukacheva |first=Natalia|title=The Arctic Promise: Legal and Political Autonomy of Greenland and Nunavut|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2007|pages=159|isbn= 978-0-8020-9486-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzPzwrUYdgkC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=High+Arctic+relocation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U06SshswZb6yJcu8rvedRIQwo1Iyw}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inuit were taken on the Eastern Arctic patrol ship {{ship|CGS|C.D. Howe}} to areas on Cornwallis and Ellesmere Islands ([[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]] and Grise Fiord), both large barren islands in the hostile polar north.&lt;ref name="damas"/&gt; While on the boat the families learned that they would not be living together but would be left at three separate locations.&lt;ref name="macq16"/&gt;

In ''Relocation to the High Arctic'', Alan R. Marcus proposes that the relocation of the Inuit not only served as an experiment, but as an answer to the [[Eskimo]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=Alan Rudolph|title=Relocating Eden: The Image and Politics of Inuit Exile in the Canadian Arctic|year=1995|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal government stressed that the Eskimo problem was linked to the Inuit's reluctance to give up their nomadic ways in areas that were supposedly overpopulated and went so far as to provide detailed accounts of poor hunting seasons and starvation within the Inukjuak area as a direct result of over-population. However, the federal government knew the area in question was in the midst of a low trapping season due to the end of a four-year fox cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=Alan Rudolph|title=Relocating Eden: The Image and Politics of Inuit Exile in the Canadian Arctic|year=1995|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New communities==
[[File:Robert Flaherty Nyla 1920.jpg|upright|thumb|Nanook's wife &amp; child, Cape Dufferin, QC, 1920–21, Robert J. Flaherty, Ink on paper]]
The families were left without sufficient supplies of food and caribou skins and other materials for making appropriate clothing and tents.&lt;ref name="macq16"/&gt; As they had been moved about {{convert|2000|km|abbr=on}} to a very different ecosystem, they were unfamiliar with the wildlife and had to adjust to months of [[polar night|24-hour darkness]] during the winter, and [[Midnight sun|24-hour sunlight]] during the summer, something that does not occur in northern Quebec.  They were told that they would be returned home after two years if they wished, but these promises were not honoured by the government.&lt;ref name="makivik"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Makivik Corporation – High Arctic Relocatees And Government Of Canada Seek Reconciliation|date=28 March 1996|publisher=Canada NewsWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relocatees included Inuit who had been involved in the filming of [[Robert J. Flaherty]]'s film ''[[Nanook of the North]]'' (1922) and Flaherty's unacknowledged illegitimate son Josephie. However, Flaherty had died in 1951, prior to the relocation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;McGrath, Melanie. ''The Long Exile: A Tale of Inuit Betrayal and Survival in the High Arctic''. Alfred A. Knopf, 2006 (268 pages) Hardcover: {{ISBN|0-00-715796-7}} Paperback: {{ISBN|0-00-715797-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, the Inuit learned the local [[beluga whale]] migration routes and were able to survive in the area, hunting over a range of {{convert|18000|km2|abbr=on|0}} each year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) reports from the time stated that the two colonies were generally successful in terms of morale, housing, and subsistence living.&lt;ref name="damas"/&gt;

==Re-evaluation==
During the 1980s, the relocated Inuit and their descendants initiated a claim against the Canadian Government arguing that "there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the central, if not the sole, reasons, for the relocation of Inuit to the High Arctic was the desire by Canada to assert its sovereignty over the Arctic Islands and surrounding area", and in 1987 sought $10 million in compensation from the federal government.&lt;ref name="tester113"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tester|first=Frank J.|author2=Kulchyski |others= Peter|title=Tammarniit (Mistakes): Inuit relocation in the eastern arctic 1939–63|publisher=UBC Press|location= Vancouver, BC|year=1994|pages=113–118|isbn=978-0-7748-0452-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVf9N3jdsp4C&amp;pg=PA401&amp;dq=high+arctic+relocation&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3nPPvRMCsN3_S7Nsd49GJv2x5XeQ#PPA102,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following public and media pressure, the federal government created a program to assist the Inuit to return to the south, and in 1989, 40 Inuit returned to their former communities, leading to a break up of families on generational lines, as younger community members often chose to remain in the High Arctic. Those that remained are described as being fiercely committed to their home.&lt;ref name="porteous"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gibney"/&gt;
[[File:Resolute Bay 2 1997-08-02.jpg|left|upright|thumb|View over Resolute Bay of the modern Inuit community of Resolute (1997)]]
In 1990, the [[House of Commons of Canada]] standing committee on Aboriginal affairs asked the government to apologize to the Inuit who had been moved to the high Arctic in 1953, to provide compensation to them, and to formally recognize the residents of Resolute and Grise Fiord for their service to Canada's sovereignty.&lt;ref name="tester102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="makivik"/&gt;  In response, the government commissioned the "Hickling Report" which absolved them of wrongdoing, arguing that the Inuit had volunteered to be moved, and that they had been relocated due to the harsh social and economic conditions in Inukjuak. The report, written by a long-time government official, was strongly criticized by academics and the media.&lt;ref name="tester102"/&gt;

In contrast, a [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]] report submitted in December 1991 argued that there was clear evidence that there were government concerns about Arctic sovereignty at the time of the relocations, and an understanding that the settlements would contribute to Canadian sovereignty.  The report concluded that the Government of Canada had broken its promise to return the relocatees to Inukjuak after two years if they wished.&lt;ref name="makivik"/&gt;
A further report, written by [[Trent University]] professor Magnus Gunther, examined the various claims of academics disputing what had occurred during the relocations.  It concluded that the government had acted with humane intentions, and as a result [[Tom Siddon]], [[Minister of Crown–Indigenous Relations|Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development]], stated that it would be "inappropriate for the government to apologize" or provide compensation.&lt;ref name="tester102"/&gt;

In July 1994, the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] held hearings to investigate the relocation program.&lt;ref name="makivik"/&gt;  The Inuit evidence overwhelmingly highlighted that they had been [[population transfer|forcibly relocated]], while government officials argued that they had moved voluntarily. The official who had been in charge of the relocation tried to suggest that witnesses had changed their stories in order to claim compensation, and that the move had been a success.&lt;ref name="porteous"/&gt;  The Commission found that the government of Canada had determined to "rehabilitate" the Inuit of Port Harrison, weaning them from dependency and "moral decline" by moving them to better lands with abundant game for hunting, and that inadequate preparations were made for them.&lt;ref name="macq16"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Spare aboriginal people the tyranny of good intentions|last=MacQueen|first=Ken|date=16 July 1994|publisher=The Hamilton Spectator|pages=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The commission recommended an apology and compensation for the survivors, as well as acknowledgment of the role the relocatees played in establishing a Canadian presence in the High Arctic.&lt;ref name="porteous"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macq16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="makivik"/&gt;  The federal government refused to apologize, but established a "Reconciliation Agreement" in March 1996, creating a $10 million CAD [[Trust law|trust fund]] for relocated individuals and their families.  The government admitted that the Inuit suffered "hardship, suffering and loss in the initial years of these relocations" but required recipients to "acknowledge that they understand that in planning the relocation, the government officials of the time were acting with honourable intentions in what was perceived to be in the best interests of the Inuit at that time."&lt;ref name="gibney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="makivik"/&gt;

After nearly five decades, an official government apology was given on 18 August 2010 to the relocated families for the inhumane treatment and suffering caused by the relocation.  [[John Duncan (Canadian politician)|John Duncan]] (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) stated: "The Government of Canada deeply regrets the mistakes and broken promises of this dark chapter of our history and apologizes for the High Arctic relocation having taken place.  We would like to pay tribute to the relocatees for their perseverance and courage...The relocation of Inuit families to the High Arctic is a tragic chapter in Canada's history that we should not forget, but that we must acknowledge, learn from and teach our children.  Acknowledging our shared history allows us to move forward in partnership and in a spirit of reconciliation."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100016115/1100100016116&lt;/ref&gt;

Two generations on, the term ''The Relocated'' remains emotive.&lt;ref name=Pope&gt;{{cite news|last=Pope|first=Frank|title=Disappearing Arctic|newspaper=The Times Magazine|date=14 May 2011|location=London|quote=The Relocated–a term still spoken in hushed terms–were then planted as human flagpoles in this desolate place.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
Carvers [[Looty Pijamini]] (of [[Grise Fiord]]) and the late [[Simeonie Amagoalik]] (of [[Resolute, Nunavut|Resolute]]) were commissioned by [[Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated]] to build a monument to commemorate the Inuit who sacrificed so much as a result of the Government relocation of 1953 and 1955. Pijamini's monument, located in Grise Fiord, depicts a woman with a young boy and a husky, with the woman sombrely looking out towards [[Resolute Bay]]. Amagoalik's monument, located in Resolute, depicts a lone man looking towards Grise Fiord. This was meant to show separated families, and depicting them longing to see each other again.

Pijamini said that he intentionally made them look melancholy because the relocation was not a happy event. The monument was unveiled in September 2010, and received praise from the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Arctic exiles to be honoured|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2010/09/06/high-arctic-exiles-monuments.html|accessdate=13 May 2011|publisher=CBC News|date=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High Arctic relocation is the subject of [[Zacharias Kunuk]]'s film ''Exile''. The film was produced by [[Isuma]], who also released ''[[Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isuma.ca/prog?what=24 Exile at Isuma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401040013/http://www.isuma.ca/prog?what=24 |date=1 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[feature film]] ever to be written, directed and acted entirely in [[Inuktitut]].

The High Arctic relocation is the subject of [[Marquise Lepage]]'s documentary film (NFB, 2008), ''Martha of the North (Martha qui vient du froid)''. This film tells the story of Martha Flaherty, granddaughter of Robert J. Flaherty, who was relocated at 5, along with her family, from Inukjuak to Grise Fiord (Ellesmere Island).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Collection|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=56486|page=National Film Board of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lepage later released the 2013 web series ''Iqqaumavara'', telling the stories of several other affected people.

A '''historical society''' (sometimes also '''preservation society''') is an organization dedicated to preserving, collecting, researching, and interpreting historical information or items. Originally, these [[societies]] were created as a way to help future generations understand their [[Cultural heritage|heritage]].

Historical societies vary in specialization, with focuses ranging from specific geographical areas such as countries or towns, [[universities]], railways, ethnic and religious groups, to [[genealogy]], pioneer history, and the preservation of [[antiques]] or historic buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publichistory.org/features/HistoricalSocietyHistory.html#|title=History of Historical Societies in the U.S.|last=Lawrence|first=Debra DeRuyver, Jennifer Evans, Sara|website=www.publichistory.org|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, many of these organizations ensure that historic architecture is [[Historic preservation|preserved]]/restored and period houses are maintained for tours open to the public.

==History==
It is said that historical societies originated in Western Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries. These early organizations were usually formed as societies for “lovers of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Historical+Societies|title=Historical Societies|website=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest historical society in the United States is what we now call the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]], which was founded in 1791 by [[Jeremy Belknap]]. He was joined by nine other Bostonians who helped him create "The Historical Society," an organization truly devoted to collecting materials for the study of American history. This like-minded group gathered family papers, books, and artifacts from their personal collections which led to the creation of the nation's first historical repository. Due to the absence of any other American historical repositories during this time, the MHS took on a national role - Something that is still evident in its collections and publications. To this day, Belknap's original vision of preserving, collecting, making resources accessible, and communicating manuscripts that promote the study of Massachusetts as well as the nation is still thriving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.masshist.org/about/history|title=Massachusetts Historical Society: History of the MHS|website=www.masshist.org|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, societies were becoming more and more democratic in their membership policies, while large groups of people were still being excluded. However, when the Progressive Era came, these historical societies finally started being seen as "institutions with a capacity or obligation to serve the public." There started to become significant growth in the public’s interest in local history when the 20th century came around, and this was apparent with the overall concern for historic preservation of cities that were going through architectural and demographic changes.  In 1940, the increase in this appreciation was reflected once again by the founding of the American Association for State and Local History. Although the accomplishments of white men were the center of the mid-century historical societies, previously neglected groups, such as ethnic minorities and women, started to gain more attention within the academic circles as society progressed. The history of historical societies in the U.S. has often been responsive to the trends within the discipline of history, however they haven’t always responded to the evolution and changes in the same way and speed. The public inclusion movement is a great example of how the historical societies were sometimes challenged with juggling competing preservation priorities and liberal access policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publichistory.org/features/HistoricalSocietyHistory.html#|title=History of Historical Societies in the U.S.|last=Lawrence|first=Debra DeRuyver, Jennifer Evans, Sara|website=www.publichistory.org|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==
Publishing journals and maintaining museums is another way in which the historical societies showcase their collections, research, and field of study. For record keeping and educational purposes, many of the transactions and papers read at society meetings have been documented and published, as we see with such publications as:

*The Society’s (Quebec) “Transactions of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=018TAAAAYAAJ|title=Transactions of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec|last=Quebec|first=Literary and Historical Society of|date=1831-01-01|publisher=The Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1831
*The Society’s (Maine) “Collections and Proceedings of the Maine Historical Society”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Hk9AQAAMAAJ|title=Collections of the Maine Historical Society|date=1893-01-01|publisher=The Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1893
*The Society’s (Boston) “Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtQiAQAAIAAJ|title=Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society|last=Society|first=Massachusetts Historical|date=1919-01-01|publisher=The Society|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1919
*The Cambridge University Press’ “Transactions of the Royal Historical Society”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foj2AwAAQBAJ|title=Transactions of the Royal Historical Society|last=Archer|first=Ian W.|date=2014-01-16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107063860|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2013

At times throughout history, certain records were also criticized. Written words were not always given the praise that was sought after; This is displayed quite vividly within the following quotes from “The American Historical Review.”

:::“The early reports of the American Historical Association contain much criticism of the work and publications of local historians and local historical societies, no less justifiable than it was sometimes scathing. …it was a president of the Massachusetts Historical Society by the name of Adams who declared that half of the publications of American historical societies could be swept from library shelves with no appreciable loss to learning.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=Julian P.|date=1934-10-01|title=State and Local Historical Societies in the United States|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/1/10|journal=The American Historical Review|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=10–37|doi=10.1086/ahr/40.1.10|issn=0002-8762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
Support from outside sources and contributors has always played an important role in the life of historical societies. Various methods such as donations, memberships, annual funds, corporate giving, internships, volunteering, and renting specific historic spaces are continuing to help keep these [[nonprofit]] societies alive and growing.

==Chartering==
While historical societies originate in different ways, usually there is a small group of people who lay down the foundation for the formal organization of the society. Such things as statement of purpose, the organizational meeting, the constitution and bylaws, incorporation, corporate title, requirements, reviewing, recommendations, and petitioning are all elements of the highly involved creation of charting a historical society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nysm.nysed.gov/services/charter/society.html Chartering a Historical Society on the New York State Museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222155405/https://www.nysm.nysed.gov/services/charter/society.html |date=2015-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York, unlike all of the other US states who view cultural agencies as nonprofit businesses, has unique ways with the creation process and sees them as educational organizations. The cultural agencies in NY are a significant part of the educational system and incorporate under [[Education Law]] rather than [[Corporation Law]]. These education corporations are also created by and are subject to the [[Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York]].

An issuance of a [[charter]] (by petitioning the Board of Regents) is necessary for any museum or historical society who intends on organizing as a nonprofit education corporation. In order to satisfying Regents standards of quality, they must develop and go through the provisional to absolute chartering process.

The period of development starts with a provisional charter, which is a form of incorporation granted for a probationary three to five years to historical societies that have expectations of meeting Regents standards. This encourages the society to progress, and at the end of the provisional period, there is a choice to petition for extension or have the charter made absolute. An absolute charter is given to societies that meet the organizational and educational standards which leads to what is called, registration. When the organization has a record of financial stability, programmatic accomplishment, and a reputation for excellence, it is often successful in meeting the registration requirements. With this successful review and recommendation that the Regents allow an absolute charter, the historical society is then registered and gains this absolute charter. From this point on, the organization must submit annual reports in order to provide current information and accomplishments to the Regents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nysm.nysed.gov/charter/ Chartering on the New York State Museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220070736/http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/charter/ |date=2015-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If he had known the regime would fall a year later, he would have stayed, he told an interviewer: "When I left in 1988 I thought there was no future for any young person in Poland. It felt like you were looking at the world through a thick wall of glass. It was sort of an un-reality&amp;nbsp;... the rules were oblique, strange, inhuman even.

{{quote|The German policy was based on terror. Poles faced the death penalty for any help they gave to Jews. Also, the Germans created a so-called "hostage" system among the Poles. In every community they designated people who would be rotated every couple of weeks. They were responsible for informing the Polish police, or the Germans, about Jews hiding in their towns. If a Jew was discovered that had not been reported, the so-called hostages would be harshly punished. So everyone was highly motivated to get rid of the Jews.&lt;ref name=Snyder12Jan2015&gt;Snyder, Donald (12 January 2015).

"The great majority of Jews in hiding", according to Grabowski, "perished as a consequence of betrayal. They were denounced or simply seized, tied up and delivered by locals to the nearest station of the Polish police, or to the German gendarmerie."&lt;ref name="Haaretz interview 11-02-2017"/&gt; He argues that Poles were responsible for the deaths, directly or indirectly, of over 200,000 Jews during the Holocaust, and that this is a conservative estimate, because it excludes victims of the Polish Blue Police.&lt;ref name="Haaretz interview 11-02-2017"/&gt;

====Reception====
The book sparked a heated public debate, particularly when first published in Poland in 2011.&lt;ref name=Fleming2016&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fleming |first1=Michael |title=Jan Grabowski, ''Hunt for the Jews: Betrayal and Murder in German-Occupied Poland'' |journal=European History Quarterly |date=April 2016 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=357–359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grabowski received death threats.&lt;ref name=Tzur18Oct2013/&gt; When a German newspaper reviewed the book favourably in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Caus, Jessica (9 June 2015). [https://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article142180592/So-halfen-polnische-Bauern-beim-Judenmord.html "So halfen polnische Bauern beim Judenmord"]. ''Die Welt''.&lt;/ref&gt; a far-right Polish website, Fronda.pl, ran a piece with the headline, "Sieg Heil, Mr. Grabowski", accompanied by a photograph of [[Joseph Goebbels]]; Grabowski successfully sued the website's owner for libel.&lt;ref name="Haaretz interview 11-02-2017"/&gt;

According to [[Bogdan Musial]], a German-Polish historian writing in 2011, ''Hunt for the Jews'' failed to examine material that contradicted Grabowski's thesis, including Polish witness statements, German statements, and archives from the Polish resistance that. Musial argued that the book underestimates the number of Jewish survivors while inflating the number of complicit Poles, and that statements made by Poles are criticized while those from Jewish witnesses are not.&lt;ref name=Musial2011&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rcin.org.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=48323|title=Judenjagd—'umiejętne działanie' czy zbrodnicza perfidia?|journal=Dzieje Najnowsze|language=pl|volume=43| issue=2|date=2011|first=Bogdan|last=Musial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the book in April 2016, [[Michael Fleming (historian)|Michael Fleming]], a British historian specializing in Polish history, wrote in support of Grabowski, describing the criticism as attempts to "reinstitute the old, discredited heroic narrative of unimpeachable Polish conduct". Arguing that these tales of heroism are common in Europe, he wrote that Grabowski's book is part of a "growing body of corrective scholarship" that discusses the indifference or complicity of European populations. He continued that Grabowski highlights the courage of the rescuers in Dąbrowa County, while demonstrating that "those who were complicit in genocide were more successful than those who sought to shelter their Jewish co-citizens." But this observation also applies to populations beyond Poland's borders. Fleming warned readers and reviewers not to "reinforce orientalist narratives about 'Eastern' Europe" or the idea that only populations close to the genocide could stop it, which he calls "fetishiz[ing] spatial proximity".&lt;ref name=Fleming2016/&gt;

[[File:Grzegorz Berendt.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Grzegorz Berendt]] criticized Grabowski in ''[[Haaretz]]''.]]
Following the book's publication in Israel in 2016, [[Grzegorz Berendt]], professor of history at the [[University of Gdańsk]] and historian for the Polish government's [[Institute of National Remembrance]], wrote in ''[[Haaretz]]'', in February 2017, that, in contrast to several other European countries, Poland's elite groups, in the underground or in exile, opposed Germany's policies toward the Jews, and expressed and acted on this opposition repeatedly. Anyone holding an official position inside occupied Poland, including the police, was obliged to follow German orders or face harsh punishment, which might be a beating or public execution. Conversely, prizes, including property plundered from Jews, were awarded for compliance. German-induced poverty in Poland—rationing of 400–700 calories per person, leading to black-market food at exhorbitant prices—meant that "thousands of people discarded moral constraints and decided to assist the Germans in rounding up Jews for economic reasons".&lt;ref name=Berendt24Feb2017/&gt; Berendt referred to Grabowski's statement in ''Hunt for the Jews'' that "the number of victims [in Poland] of the ''Judenjagd'' could reach 200,000"{{sfn|Grabowski|2013|p=3}} as "hot air", in that it significantly exceeds, he wrote, the c.&amp;nbsp;50,000 Jews thought to have escaped from the ghettos in occupied Poland.&lt;ref name=Berendt24Feb2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-poles-weren-t-tacit-collaborators-with-nazi-extermination-of-jews-1.5441677|last=Berendt|first=Grzegorz|title=Opinion: The Polish People Weren't Tacit Collaborators with Nazi Extermination of Jews|work=Haaretz|date=24 February 2017|archiveurl=http://archive.is/6CbWY|archivedate=28 January 2018|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, Grabowski responded in ''Hararetz'' that, until recently, Poles who were made [[Righteous Among the Nations]] often asked [[Yad Vashem]] to allow them to remain anonymous, so fearful were they of their fellow Poles' reaction. He argued that, although the [[Polish government-in-exile]] (which was based in London from 1940 until 1990) had indeed spoken out on behalf of the Jews during the Holocaust, they were not supported in this by the Polish resistance or the general population in Poland. Key members of the Polish resistance had referred to the "Jewish problem" or "Jewish question": Grabowski quoted one prominent member of the underground: "The mass murder of Jews in Poland carried out by the Germans will diminish the Jewish problem but it will not remove it altogether." As for the estimate that up to 200,000 Jews were killed by Poles, Grabowski defended the figure, writing that it derives from careful research conducted by the Polish historian [[Szymon Datner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grabowski |first1=Jan |title=Opinion: No, Poland's Elites Didn't Try to Save the Jews During the Holocaust |url=https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-no-poland-s-elites-didn-t-try-to-save-the-jews-during-the-holocaust-1.5449663 |work=Haaretz |date=19 March 2017 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/uackW |archivedate=28 January 2018|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views ===
In 2016 Grabowski published a paper criticizing what he called "the history policy of the Polish state", and arguing that "the state-sponsored version of history seeks to undo the findings of the last few decades and to forcibly introduce a sanitized, feel-good narrative".&lt;ref&gt;Grabowski, Jan (6 January 2017). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23739770.2016.1262991 "The Holocaust and Poland's 'History Policy'"]. ''Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs''. 10(3), pp.&amp;nbsp;481–486.&lt;/ref&gt; He has deplored plans for a monument to rescuers of Jews, to be located at [[Grzybowski Square]], which was part of the wartime [[Warsaw Ghetto]]; he sees it as an attempt to inflate the role of [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|the rescuers]], whom he describes as a "desperate, hunted, tiny minority", the exception to the rule. The ghetto site should be dedicated, he argues, to Jewish suffering, not to Polish courage.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Don (17 April 2013).

[[File:The Ulma Family Museum of Poles Saving Jews in World War II.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Markowa Ulma-Family Museum of Poles Who Saved Jews in World War II]], [[Markowa]], Poland]]
In July 2017 Grabowski criticized the [[Markowa Ulma-Family Museum of Poles Who Saved Jews in World War II|Ulma-Family Museum of Poles Who Saved Jews in World War II]] in Markowa, which opened in 2016. The garden will have plaques identifying the 1,500 towns in which the nearly 6,700 Poles lived who helped Jews and were recognized by [[Yad Vashem]] as [[Righteous Among the Nations]].&lt;ref name="biznesistyl"&gt;Gieroń, Aneta (21 July 2017). [http://www.biznesistyl.pl/kultura/oblicza-kultury/5829_.html "Przy Muzeum Ulmów w Markowej powstaje Sad Pamięci"]. ''Biznesistyl''.&lt;/ref&gt; In Grabowski's view, the museum should provide more information about the Polish neighbours of the Ulma family and others who aided Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Aderet, Ofer (22 March 2016). [https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-museum-for-poles-who-saved-jews-stirs-controversy-1.5420775 "Polish Museum Honoring Poles Who Saved Jews Arouses Controversy"], ''Haaretz''.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that the number of Poles recognized by Yad Vashem is not representative of the Polish population, and that those who did help Jews feared their neighbours, Grabowski believes that Polish authorities are using the museum to suggest that the "rescue of Jews was widespread in occupied Poland".&lt;ref name="Haaretz interview 11-02-2017"/&gt;

Poland's embassy in Ottawa criticized Grabowski in 2016 for "groundless opinions and accusations" after he wrote an article for ''Macleans'' about Poland's controversial amendment to its [[Act on the Institute of National Remembrance]].&lt;ref&gt;Graowski, Jan (20 September 2016).

''Legion Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''Haaretz'' that the Holocaust in Poland was "not only a German-Jewish affair": "The assumption that the extermination occurred in outer space, that the Holocaust happened without Polish society becoming aware of this unfortunate event, is simply absolutely false.&amp;nbsp;...

===Statements in opposition and support===
On 7 June 2017 the [[Polish League Against Defamation]] released a statement signed by 134 Polish scientists protesting Grabowski's "false and wrongful image of Poland and Polish people".&lt;ref name=League7June2017/&gt; The statement was sent to the University of Ottawa and to the publishers of his books and articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PLAD publishes a statement concerning the activities of Jan Grabowski |url=http://www.anti-defamation.org/rdiplad/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-06-07-EN-press.pdf |publisher=Polish League Against Defamation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823020518/http://www.anti-defamation.org/rdiplad/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-06-07-EN-press.pdf |archivedate=23 August 2018 |date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that 6,706 Poles were made [[Righteous Among the Nations]] after the war by the State of Israel, it alleged that Grabowski used "vivid and exaggerated statements to create propagandistic constructions, rather than to provide an honest picture". It referred to German efforts to exterminate the Polish population, which made its occupation of Poland different from western Europe's occupation; to numerous examples of Poles' assistance to Jews; and to Poland's international protests at the plight of the Jewish population. It alleged that assistance by Poles was often hindered by Jews' low proficiency in Polish, by mistrust created by Jews' affiliation with Soviet authorities, and by [[Orthodox Jews]]' mistrust of non-Jews.&lt;ref name=League7June2017&gt;{{cite web |title=The standpoint of Polish scholars affiliated with the Polish League Against Defamation on the activities of Jan Grabowski |url=http://www.anti-defamation.org/rdiplad/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2017-06-07-EN-standpoint-of-Polish-scholars-on-the-activities-of-Jan-Grabowski.pdf |publisher=Polish League Against Defamation |date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deborah Lipstadt Remembering the Shoah presentation.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Deborah Lipstadt]], one of around 180 historians who defended Grabowski]]
In response, the [[Polish Center for Holocaust Research]] issued a statement of its own a few days later, entitled "In defence of Jan Grabowski's good name". Signed by seven of its members, including [[Barbara Engelking]], [[Jacek Leociak]] and [[Dariusz Libionka]], it called the criticism from the Polish League Against Defamation as "brutal as it is absurd", and stated that none of the 134 signatories was a Holocaust historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=In defence of Jan Grabowski's good name |url=http://www.holocaustresearch.pl/nowy/photo/file/statement_Polish_Center_for_Holocaust_Research_in_defense_of_Jan_Grabowski%27s_good_name.pdf |publisher=Polish Center for Holocaust Research |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822225442/http://www.holocaustresearch.pl/nowy/photo/file/statement_Polish_Center_for_Holocaust_Research_in_defense_of_Jan_Grabowski%27s_good_name.pdf |archivedate=22 August 2018 |date=10 June 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Rights Research and Education Centre at the University of Ottawa also expressed its full support for Grabowski, referring to his "highly respected scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://cdp-hrc.uottawa.ca/en/statement-attacks-against-professor-jan-grabowski |title=Statement on Attacks against Professor Jan Grabowski |publisher=University of Ottawa Human Rights Research and Education Centre|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823014212/https://cdp-hrc.uottawa.ca/en/statement-attacks-against-professor-jan-grabowski|archivedate=23 August 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2017, some 180 Holocaust historians and other historians of modern European history signed an open letter in Grabowski's defence, addressed to [[Calin Rovinescu]], Chancellor of the University of Ottawa. Describing the campaign against Grabowski as "an attack on academic freedom and integrity", the letter said that "[h]is scholarship holds to the highest standards of academic research and publication", and that the Polish League Against Defamation puts forth a "distorted and whitewashed version of the history of Poland during the Holocaust era".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7337">'''Jussi M. Hanhimäki''' (born February 3, 1965 in Espoo) is a Finnish historian, specializing in the history of the [[Cold War]], American foreign policy, transatlantic relations, international organizations and refugees.

== Background ==

Hanhimäki is currently professor of international history at the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]], in Geneva. He has previously taught at the London School of Economics and Political Science. His book ''The Flawed Architect: Henry Kissinger and American Foreign Policy'' has been acclaimed by his academic peers. In the US media, however, its reception was lukewarm and the book was criticized for representing "standard-issue European leftist" views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/26/books/review/26BOOT01.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=&amp;_r=0 |title='The Flawed Architect': Sizing Up Kissinger |work=[[New York Times]] |author=Max Boot |date=September 26, 2004 |accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/kissinger-myths/1047/ |title=The Kissinger Myths |work=New York Sun |author=Tom Donnelly |date=August 31, 2004 |accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, Hanhimäki was named Finland Distinguished Professor by the Academy of Finland.&lt;ref name="graduateinstitute"&gt;Jussi Hanhimäki's home page at the Graduate Institute http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/study/faculty/professors.html/_/people/hanhimaki&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Boston.

{{Calendar}}
'''March''' is the third month of the year in both the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s. It is the second of seven months to have a length of 31 days. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the [[Meteorology|meteorological]] beginning of [[Spring (season)|spring]] occurs on the first day of March. The [[March equinox]] on the 20th or 21st marks the [[Vernal equinox|astronomical beginning of spring]] in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of [[autumn]] in the Southern Hemisphere, where [[September]] is the seasonal equivalent of the Northern Hemisphere's March.

==Origin==
[[Image:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry mars.jpg|right|thumb|March, from the ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]],'' a book of prayers to be said at [[canonical hours]]]]

The name of March comes from ''[[Martius (month)|Martius]]'', the first month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]]. It was named after [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the [[List of Roman deities|Roman god]] of war, and an ancestor of the Roman people through his sons [[Romulus and Remus]]. His month ''Martius'' was the beginning of the season for warfare,&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], John North, and Simon Price, ''Religions of Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 47–48 and 53.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Roman festivals|festivals]] held in his honor during the month were mirrored by others in October, when the season for these activities came to a close.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), p. 37. The views of [[Georg Wissowa]] on the festivals of Mars framing the military campaigning season are summarized by C. Bennett Pascal, "October Horse," ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 85 (1981),  p. 264, with bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Martius'' remained the first month of the Roman calendar year perhaps as late as 153 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 84; Gary Forsythe, ''Time in Roman Religion: One Thousand Years of Religious History'' (Routledge, 2012), p. 14 (on the uncertainty of when the change occurred).&lt;/ref&gt; and several [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious observances]] in the first half of the month were originally [[new year]]'s celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'', p. 85ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in [[late antiquity]], [[Roman mosaic]]s picturing the months sometimes still placed March first.&lt;ref&gt;Aïcha Ben Abed, ''Tunisian Mosaics: Treasures from Roman Africa'' (Getty Publications, 2006), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[March 1]] began the numbered year in Russia until the end of the 15th century. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and its colonies continued to use March 25 until 1752, when they finally adopted the Gregorian calendar (the fiscal year in the UK continues to begin on the 6th April, initially identical to 25 March in the former Julian calendar). Many other cultures and religions still celebrate the beginning of the New Year in March.

March is the first month of spring in the Northern Hemisphere (North America, Europe, Asia and part of Africa) and the first month of fall or autumn in the Southern Hemisphere (South America, part of Africa, and Oceania).

Ancient Roman observances celebrated in March include [[Agonalia#Agonium Martiale|Agonium Martiale]], celebrated on March 1, March 14, and March 17,  [[Matronalia]], celebrated on March 1, [[Junonalia]],  celebrated on March 7, [[Equirria]], celebrated on March 14, [[Mamuralia]], celebrated on either March 14 or March 15, [[Hilaria]] on March 15 and then through March 22–28, [[Argei]], celebrated on March 16–17, [[Liberalia]] and [[Bacchanalia]], celebrated March 17, [[Quinquatria]], celebrated March 19–23, and [[Tubilustrium]], celebrated March 23. These dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].

==Other names==
In Finnish, the month is called ''maaliskuu'', which is believed to originate from ''maallinen kuu'', during March, earth finally becomes visible under the snow (other etymological theories have however been put forward). In [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], the month is called ''березень''/''berezenʹ'', meaning ''birch tree'', and březen in Czech.  Historical names for March include the [[Old English|Saxon]] ''Lentmonat'', named after the [[March equinox]] and gradual lengthening of days, and the eventual namesake of [[Lent]]. [[Saxons]] also called March ''Rhed-monat'' or ''Hreth-monath'' (deriving from their goddess ''Rhedam''/''Hreth''), and [[Angles]] called it ''Hyld-monath''.

In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the traditional name is ''sušec'', meaning the month when the earth becomes dry enough so that it is possible to cultivate it. The name was first written in 1466 in the Škofja Loka manuscript. Other names were used too, for example ''brezen'' and ''breznik'', "the month of birches".&lt;ref name="KoledarDPG2007"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije občine Dobrova–Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova–Polhov Gradec |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060918/http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''Mart'' is given after the name of ''[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]'' the god.

{{Marxism|Aspects}}
'''Marxist aesthetics''' is a theory of [[aesthetics]] based on, or derived from, the theories of [[Karl Marx]]. It involves a [[dialectical]] and [[materialist]], or [[dialectical materialist]], approach to the application of [[Marxism]] to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc.  Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks. From one classic Marxist point of view, the role of art is not only to represent such conditions truthfully, but also to seek to improve them (social/socialist realism); however, this is a contentious interpretation of the limited but significant writing by Marx and Engels on art and especially on aesthetics. For instance, [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], who greatly influenced the art of the early [[Soviet Union]], followed the secular humanism of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] more than he followed Marx.

Marxist aesthetics overlaps with the Marxist theory of art. It is particularly concerned with art practice, with the prescribing of artistic standards that are deemed socially beneficial. This materialist and socialist orientation may be seen to invoke (however problematically) the traditional aims of scientific inquiry and the scientific method.

Some notable Marxist aestheticians include [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]], [[Mikhail Lifshitz]], [[William Morris]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Georg Lukács]], [[Terry Eagleton]], [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Raymond Williams]]. [[Roland Barthes]] must also be mentioned here.

Not all of these figures are solely concerned with aesthetics: in many cases, Marxist aesthetics forms only an important branch of their work, depending on how one defines the term. For example, a Marxist aesthetic may be latent in Brecht's work, but he formulated his own distinct theory of art and its social purpose.

One of the chief concerns of Marxist aesthetics is to unite Marx and Engels’ social and economic theory, or theory of the social ''base'', to the domain of art and culture, the ''superstructure''. These two terms, base and superstructure, became an important dichotomy in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846), which however was not published during their lifetimes. Likewise Marx's early ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'', which, though widely regarded as important for treating the themes of sensuousness and alienation, first appeared only in 1932 (the slated 1846 publication was canceled) and in English only in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Tedman, Gary. (2004) "Marx's 1844 manuscripts as a work of art: A hypertextual reinterpretation." ''Rethinking Marxism'' 16.4: 427-441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fay, Margaret, "The Influence of Adam Smith on Marx's Theory of Alienation", ''Science &amp; Society'' Vol. 47, No. 2 (Summer, 1983), pp. 129-151, S&amp;S Quarterly, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts were therefore unknown to art theorists during, for instance, the often antagonistic debates on art in the early Soviet Union between the [[constructivism (art)|constructivist]] avant garde and the proponents of [[socialist realism]]. The controversy over the unusual design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gary.tedman.pagesperso-orange.fr/index.htm |author=Gary Tedman |title=Economic &amp; Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 (as hypertext) by Karl Marx |date=2007 |accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the original documents adds another twist.&lt;ref&gt;See notes, Margaret Fay, Gary Tedman.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many theorists touch upon important themes of Marxist aesthetics without strictly being Marxist aestheticians, [[Joel Kovel]], for instance, has extended the concepts of Marxian ecology which deeply implicates aesthetics. He is also a part of the struggle to bridge the space between Marx and [[Freud]], which has Marxist aesthetics as a central concern.&lt;ref&gt;See the journal ''Capitalism, Nature, Socialism''.&lt;/ref&gt; Current themes within the field include research on the effect of [[mass production|mass-produced]] industrial materials on the sensed environment, such as paints and colors.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Iona. (2007) "Color, Facture, Art and Design." ''Capitalism Nature Socialism'' 18.1: 64-80.&lt;/ref&gt; A strong current within the field involves linguistics and semiotics, and arguments over structuralism and post-structuralism, modernism and post-modernism, as well as feminist theory.

Visual artists, as diverse as [[Isaak Brodsky]] or [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Kasimir Malevich]] or [[Lyubov Popova]], for example, for whom written theory is secondary, nevertheless may be said to be connected to Marxist aesthetics through their production of art, without necessarily declaring themselves aestheticians or Marxists in writing. Likewise, in this spirit [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Dziga Vertov]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Richard Paul Lohse]], for example. Such a view could apply to many visual and other artists in many fields, even those who have no apparent and/or voiced connection to Marxist politics or even those ostensibly opposed; in this respect consider [[Anton Webern]].

Probably it would be fair to say that two of the most influential writings in Marxist aesthetics in recent times, and apart from Marx himself and Lukacs, have been Walter Benjamin's essay ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]'', and Herbert Marcuse's ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]''. Louis Althusser has also contributed some small but significant essays on art and his theory of ideology also impacts in this area ("[[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses]]").

The field remains polemical, with camps of modernists, post modernists, anti modernists, the avant garde, constructivists, social realists and socialist realists all referencing back to an ostensible Marxist aesthetic theory that would underpin their art practices by grounding an art theory.

'''Marxist sociology''' is the study of [[sociology]] from a [[Marxist]] perspective.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;Allan G. Johnson, ''The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: a user's guide to sociological language'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2000, {{ISBN|0-631-21681-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA183 p. 183-84 (Google Books)].&lt;/ref&gt; Marxism itself can be recognized as both a [[political philosophy]] and a [[sociology]], particularly so far as it attempts to remain [[Scientific method|scientific, systematic]], and objective rather than purely [[normative]] and [[:wikt:prescriptive|prescriptive]]. Marxist sociology is "a form of [[conflict theory]] associated with&amp;nbsp;... Marxism's objective of developing a [[Positivism (sociology)|positive]] ([[empirical]]) science of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[society]] as part of the mobilization of a revolutionary [[working class]]."&lt;ref name="encofsoc"&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/research/marxist-sociology-eos-03/ Marxist Sociology], ''Encyclopedia of Sociology'', Macmillan Reference, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Sociological Association]] has a section dedicated to the issues of Marxist sociology that is "interested in examining how insights from Marxist [[methodology]] and Marxist analysis can help explain the complex dynamics of modern society".&lt;ref name="section"&gt;[http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html About the Section on Marxist Sociology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109001255/http://www2.asanet.org/sectionmarxist/about.html |date=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist sociology would come to facilitate the developments of [[critical theory]] and [[cultural studies]] as loosely distinct disciplines.

== Concepts and issues ==

Key concepts of Marxist sociology include [[historical materialism]], [[Mode of production|modes of production]], and the relation between [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Labour (economics)|labour]].&lt;ref name="encofsoc"/&gt; Marxist sociology is primarily concerned with, but not limited to, the relations between society and economics.&lt;ref name="section"/&gt; Marxist Sociology is also concerned with the way in which police forces are used to control indigenous polulations, enslaved peoples, and the laboring poor in the name of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1028737741|title=Police : a field guide|last=1968-|first=Correia, David,|others=Wall, Tyler,|isbn=9781786630148|location=London|oclc=1028737741}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key questions asked by Marxist sociologists include:&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;
* How does capital control workers?
* How does a mode of production influence the [[social class]]?
* What is the relation between workers, capital, [[State (polity)|the state]] and [[culture]]?
* How do economic factors influence inequalities such as those relating to [[gender]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]?
*What role do police play within Marxist Socialism?

Within the field of [[sociological theory]], Marxist sociology is recognized as one of the major [[sociological paradigm]]s and is associated with conflict theory and critical theory. Unlike [[Marxism]] and [[Marxist philosophy]], Marxist sociology has put relatively little weight on creating [[class revolution]],&lt;ref name="black"/&gt; pursuing instead the development of an objective, [[Political economy|politico-economic]] study of society rather than a critical philosophy of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].&lt;ref name="encofsoc"/&gt; It may be seen as a field of [[economic sociology]].

== Historical development ==
{{hatnote|References for this section:&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;&lt;ref name="encofsoc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dictbot"&gt;Tom B. Bottomore, ''A Dictionary of Marxist thought'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1991 (2nd ed.), {{ISBN|0-631-18082-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q4QwNP_K1pYC&amp;pg=PA506 p. 505-08 (Google Books)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Influenced by the thought of [[Karl Marx]], Marxist sociology emerged during the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. As well as Marx, [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] are considered seminal influences in [[History of sociology|early sociology]]. The first Marxist school of sociology was known as [[Austro-Marxism]], of which [[Carl Grünberg]] and [[Antonio Labriola]] were among its most notable members. Much of the development in the field of Marxist sociology occurred on the outskirts of academia, pitting Marxist against "[[bourgeois]]" sociology.

For a while, this division was reinforced by the Marxism-inspired [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]], which led to the creation of the [[Soviet Union]]; soon, however, sociology found itself a victim of the [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union#Sociology|suppression of "bourgeois" science]] in the communist states. While, after several decades, sociology was reestablished in communist states, two separate currents of thought evolved within Marxist sociology: [[Soviet Marxism]], developed in the communist states (primarily the [[Soviet Union]]) of the 20th century, serving the state's interests and significantly crippled by forced adherence to the [[dogma]] of [[historical materialism]]; and the more independent school centered on the studies of Marxism in [[Western world|the West]]. During the 1940s, the [[Western Marxism|Western Marxist]] school became accepted within Western academia, subsequently fracturing into several different perspectives such as the [[Frankfurt School]] or [[critical theory]].

Due to its former state-supported position, there has been a backlash against Marxist thought in [[post-communist]] states (see, for example, [[Sociology in Poland]]) but it remains dominant in the sociological research sanctioned and supported by those communist states that remain (see, for example, [[Sociology in China]]).

{{Marxism}}

'''Maximilien Rubel''' (10 October 1905 in [[Chernivtsi]] – 28 February 1996 in [[Paris]]) was a famous [[Marxist_historiography|Marxist historian]] and [[Council communism|council communist]].

Rubel was born in western [[Ukraine]] and was educated in law and philosophy in [[Vienna]] and [[Chernivtsi University|Chernivtsi National University]], the town of his birth and was influenced by the [[Austro-Marxism|Austro-Marxist]] [[Max Adler (Marxist)|Max Adler]].&lt;ref name=SPGB&gt;{{cite web|title=Maximilien Rubel: Anti-Bolshevik Marxist|url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/1990s/1996/no-1102-june-1996/maximilien-rubel-anti-bolshevik-marxist|website=worldsocialism.org|publisher=Socialist Party of Great Britain|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[France]] in 1931 to study sociology at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], from which he received his [[Licentiate (degree)|Licence-ès-lettres]] in 1934. He became a French citizen in 1937, and shortly after began publishing the literary magazine ''Verbe-Cahiers humains'', before being drafted into the [[French Army]]. Due to his [[Jewish]] origins, Rubel lived semi-secretly in Paris under the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Military history of France during World War II|occupation of France]].

In his encounters with Marxist members of the [[French Resistance|resistance movement]] in this milieu Rubel was reputedly astonished by the incoherence and confusion that surrounded [[Karl Marx]] and so-called "scientific" [[socialism]]. In difficult circumstances Rubel then set to work to gain a thorough understanding of Marx's life and work. It was Rubel who originally coined the term "''[[Marxology|marxologie]]''" to refer to a systematic scholarly approach to the understanding of Marx and Marxism, which he saw as quite distinct.

After the war, Rubel continued with his research, first publishing on Marx in 1946, and receiving a [[Doctorate|Doctorat-ès-lettres]] from the Sorbonne in 1954. He joined the Centre d'études sociologiques in the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] in 1947, and retired as ''Maître de recherche honoraire'' in 1970. Rubel published widely on Marx—more than 80 titles—and had a very active academic career. He combined controversial readings of Marx with rigorous scholarship, and was frequently polemical in his criticisms of the ideologies of "Marxism", which he often contrasted with a view of [[working class]] liberation that emphasised the "self-movement" of the working class above all else.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6923">'''Michael Glykas''' or '''Glycas''' ({{lang-gr|Μιχαὴλ Γλυκᾶς}}) was a 12th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[historian]], [[theologian]], [[mathematician]], [[astronomer]] and [[poet]]. He was probably from [[Corfu]] and lived in [[Constantinople]]. He was a critic of [[Manuel I Komnenos]], and was imprisoned and [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]] due to his participation in a conspiracy against the emperor. He is also identified by modern scholarship with '''Michael Sikidites''' (Μιχαὴλ Σικιδίτης), who was condemned as a [[heresiarch]] in 1200.

==Life==
[[File:Manuel I Comnenus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Manuscript miniature of [[Manuel I Komnenos]], [[Vatican Library]]]]
Glykas was born sometime in the first third of the 12th century,&lt;ref name=ODB&gt;{{ODB|title=Glykas, Michael|last=Kazhdan|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Kazhdan|pages=855–856}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly {{circa|1130}}.&lt;ref name=LexMA&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Glykas Sikidites, Michael|last=Schreiner|first=Peter|at=col. 1519|encyclopedia=[[Lexikon des Mittelalters]]|volume=4|publisher=Artemis &amp; Winkler|location=Munich and Zürich|year=1989|isbn=3-7608-8904-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His probable birthplace was [[Corfu]].&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt;

He served as imperial secretary (''grammatikos'') under Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] ({{reign|1143|1180}}), before being involved in a conspiracy against the emperor and being [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinded]]. The blinding was probably partial or slight, since he continued his literary activity.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; The exact nature of this conspiracy is unknown, but Otto Kresten suggested a connection with the alleged conspiracy that led to the downfall of Manuel's chief minister [[Theodore Styppeiotes]] in 1158/9.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt; He remained imprisoned until at least 1164, and his subsequent fate is unknown. Modern scholars commonly support his identity with a certain Michael Sikidites, charged with heresy and magic in {{circa|1200}}.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt;

According to [[Niketas Choniates]], this Sikidites "was enrolled among the imperial secretaries" of Manuel I, was known of performing magic spells, conjuring serpents and demons. He preached a doctrine according to which the [[sacraments]] of the [[Eucharist]] were mortal and corruptible, as Christ's own body was. Furthermore, Sikidites and his followers considered a [[bodily resurrection]] impossible, and thought that the dead would be resurrected as ghostly spirits only. The doctrine appears to have enjoyed some support in leading circles, notably of the [[Patriarchs of Constantinople]] [[George II Xiphilinos]] and [[John X Kamateros]], but also aroused passionate opposition; in a [[synod]] in 1200, Sikidites was censured and his teachings declared heretical.&lt;ref name=Sikidites&gt;{{cite book |last=Simpson |first=Alicia |title=Niketas Choniates: A Historiographical Study |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-967071-0 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nePUAAAAQBAJ | pages = 28, 47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
His first known work were his ''Verses from Prison'', a poem of 581 lines in [[political verse]], written during his imprisonment. It contains many elements of the vernacular Greek language of his time (an early form of [[Modern Greek]]), in contrast to the highly stylized and archaic [[Attic Greek]] favoured by Byzantine intellectuals.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; In 1164/65, he composed an ''[[encomium]]'' celebrating Emperor Manuel's Hungarian campaign.&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; He also wrote a mathematical treatise on the distinction between [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]],&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; where he severely criticised Manuel I for his fondness for the latter; in the same vein, Glykas strongly rejected the concept of inevitable fate (''ananke'') as a force in history.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt; 

His chief work is his [[chronicle]] (βίβλος χρονική, ''biblos chronike'') of events from the [[Dating creation|creation of the world]] to the death of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in 1118.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; His main sources for the chronicle were [[George Monachos]], [[John Skylitzes]] and his continuators, [[John Zonaras]], and [[Constantine Manasses]].&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; Over half the work is dedicated to the narrative of the creation and early Jewish history.&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; As a historical source, it contains no new information,&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt; but Glykas displays his opposition to the [[Komnenian dynasty]], and emulates Zonaras in his criticism of Alexios I.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt; 

Another notable work, which led [[Hans-Georg Beck]] to describe Glykas as the "most original and vivid [[exegete]] of the 12th century", was the collection of 95 replies on theological questions (Εἰς τὰς ἀπορίας τῆς Θείας Γραφῆς κεφάλαια, ''Chapters on the questions on the Holy Scripture''), written in letter form. Among them is a letter where he criticises Manuel I for his incorrect use of passages from the [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref name=LexMA/&gt;

His surviving work, including his letters, is "overtly didactic", promoting Christian virtues, and making extensive use of [[proverbs]] to this end.&lt;ref name=ODB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20043">[[File:Pokrovsky-MN.jpg|thumb|right|M.N. Pokrovsky (1868-1932), Soviet historian.]]

'''Mikhail Nikolayevich Pokrovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Михаи́л Никола́евич Покро́вский}}, {{OldStyleDate|August 29|1868|August 17}} – April 10, 1932) was a [[Russia]]n [[Marxist]] [[historian]]. One of the earliest professionally trained historians to join the Russian revolutionary movement, Pokrovsky is regarded as the most influential Soviet historian of the 1920s.

Pokrovsky was neither a [[Bolshevik]] nor a [[Menshevik]] for nearly a decade prior to the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, instead living in European exile as an independent radical close to philosopher [[Alexander Bogdanov]]. Following the Bolshevik seizure of power, Pokrovsky rejoined the Bolshevik Party and moved to Moscow, where he became the deputy chief of the Soviet government's new department of education, the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment.

Pokrovsky played a leading role in the early Soviet educational establishment, editing several of the major historical journals of the period, and guiding the restructuring of the higher education system and its personnel as head of the [[Institute of Red Professors]]. He was also the author of influential and pioneering works of Russian history, presenting semi-official reinterpretations of the Russian past presented through the lens of [[class struggle]] and the [[historical materialism|progress of history through concrete stages of development]]. Pokrovsky was harshly critical of the nature of the multi-national Tsarist empire and deemphasized the personal role played by individuals such as the modernizing Tsar [[Peter the Great]].

After his death in 1932, Pokrovsky's writings came to be repudiated by the Soviet regime of [[Joseph Stalin]] for their supposed "vulgar sociologism" and insufficient appreciation of the role of great men in history, as well as for a lack of patriotic fervor. An official campaign of denunciation of Pokrovsky's alleged errors was initiated in January 1936.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Mikhail Pokrovsky was born August 29, 1868 in [[Moscow]] into the family of a state official who had gained [[hereditary nobility]] from the Tsar.&lt;ref name=Intro3&gt;Roman Szporluk, "Introduction" to Roman Szporluk and Mary Ann Szporluk (ed. and trans.), ''Russia in World History: Selected Essays.'' Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1970; pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He was well educated as a boy, completing work at a classical [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] before enrolling in the History Department of [[Moscow University]] at the age of 19, where he studied under [[Vasily Klyuchevsky]] and [[Paul Vinogradov]], two of the most renowned historians of the era.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;George Jackson with Robert Devlin, ''Dictionary of the Russian Revolution.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1989; pp. 451-453.&lt;/ref&gt; He would graduate from that institution in 1891, going on to pursue a [[Master's degree]] with Klyuchevsky; this work was not completed due to personal differences.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

Undeterred by his lack of an advanced academic degree, Pokrovsky began teaching in secondary schools and university extension programs, pursuing his ambition of becoming a professional historian.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt; He did not gain a university teaching position, however, instead being forced to settle for teaching history courses in secondary schools, evening extension courses, and non-university courses for women.&lt;ref name=Intro4&gt;Szporluk, "Introduction," pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A young man of progressive sympathies, Prokrovsky was finally prohibited from giving public lectures in 1902 owing to his radical views.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

Specifics of Pokrovsky's early political activity are sparse, with Pokrovsky himself acknowledging many years after the fact that he had participated in the [[Union of Liberation]], a middle class organization seeking the establishment of a constitution for Russia that was a forerunner of the [[Constitutional-Democratic Party]] (Cadets).&lt;ref name=Intro3 /&gt;

===From 1905 to 1917===
[[File:A A Bogdanov.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bolshevik philosopher and writer Alexander Bogdanov (1873-1928), with whom Pokrovsky was closely associated during his years of European exile.]]

Pokrovsky became a [[Marxism|Marxist]] during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], joining the [[Bolshevik Party]].&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt; Jackson was invited by party leader [[V. I. Lenin|V.I. Ulianov (Lenin)]] to contribute to the party's official newspaper published in exile, ''Proletarii'' (The Proletarian).&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

Inside the Bolshevik organization, Pokrovsky was close to the radical faction surrounding [[Alexander Bogdanov]], the ''[[Vpered]]'' (Forward) group.&lt;ref name=Fitz6&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment: Soviet Organization of Education and the Arts under Lunacharsky, October 1917-21.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1970; pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Other key members of this faction included future Bolshevik education chief [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] and prominent writer [[Maxim Gorky]].&lt;ref name=Fitz6 /&gt;

The failure of the 1905 revolution caused Pokrovsky to emigrate, first to [[Finland]] before making his way to [[France]] in 1908.&lt;ref name=Intro5&gt;Szporluk, "Introduction," pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Pokrovsky would remain in French exile until the coming of the [[October Revolution]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=Intro5 /&gt; It was in French exile that Pokrovsky wrote his first major historiographic work, ''The History of Russia from Earliest Times,'' published in five volumes from 1910 to 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Szporluk, "Introduction,'' pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdanov and the ''Vperedists'' established a Marxist party school on the Italian island of [[Capri]] early in 1909, with a view to educating and training ordinary working class Russians as future party leaders, intending the project to be open to adherents of the Bolshevik and [[Menshevik]] organizations alike.&lt;ref name=Fitz6 /&gt; Pokrovsky was called upon as a party academic to lecture at the Capri school on the topic of Russian history.&lt;ref name=Fitz6 /&gt; After Bogdanov's expulsion from the Bolshevik Party in 1909, Pokrovsky followed him out of that organization.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt; He would remain a non-Bolshevik radical until the revolutionary year of 1917, when he returned to Moscow and became a member of the [[Moscow Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies]].&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

The ''Vperedists'' in exile established a second Russian party school in [[Bologna]], Italy from 1910 to 1911, again seeking participation from both Bolshevik and Menshevik wings of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]].&lt;ref name=Fitz7&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Pokrovsky again participated in this project as a history lecturer, being joined by Lunacharsky, Bogdanov, and others.&lt;ref name=Fitz7 /&gt; Chief factional leaders Lenin and Georgy Plekhanov were hostile to the project, however, and the Bologna school — and with it the ''Vpered'' group itself — subsequently disintegrated.&lt;ref name=Fitz7 /&gt;

===Years after the October Revolution===

Pokrovsky returned to Russia in August 1917, following the [[February Revolution]] which overthrew [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas Romanov II]].&lt;ref name=Intro8&gt;Szporluk, "Introduction,'' pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He was formally readmitted to the Bolshevik Party the following month and was soon in a position of trust and authority, editing the daily newspaper of the Moscow Soviet, ''[[Izvestiya|Izvestiia]].''&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

Following the [[October Revolution]] which brought the Bolshevik Party to power, Pokrovsky was named as Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Moscow Soviet.&lt;ref name=Intro8 /&gt; He was also chosen for the commission which drafted the first [[Russian Constitution of 1918|Constitution of Soviet Russia]] in 1918 and in March 1918 was elected Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars for the Moscow region.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

When former ''Vperedist'' Anatoly Lunacharsky was tapped as the first head of the [[People's Commissariat of Enlightenment]] (successor to the Russian Ministry of Public Education), Lenin directly suggested to him that his own wife, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], and Pokrovsky should be included as prime organizers with Lunacharsky of the new government body.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Pokrovsky would become Deputy Commissar of the reformed educational ministry in May 1918, overseeing direction of that body during Lunacharsky's frequent absences from Moscow during the rest of 1918.&lt;ref&gt;According to historian [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]], People's Commissar of Education Lunacharsky spent just 10 weeks in Moscow between April and December 1918. See: Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pokrovsky again ran afoul of charges of oppositionism in 1919 when he lent his support to [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and the [[Left communism|Left Communists]] in opposition to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] — a matter of bitter and divisive debate within the Russian Communist Party.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

===Impact on Soviet institutions===

Several Soviet educational entities are credited in some measure to Pokrovsky's influence. These include the "workers' faculties" ''(rabfaki)'' established to provide college preparatory education for factory workers to allow their admission to higher education without having graduated from the formal secondary education process.&lt;ref name=Intro9&gt;Szporluk, "Introduction," pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Pokrovsky was also instrumental in the establishment of the [[Institute of Red Professors]] (IKP), a de facto graduate school for the advanced training of historians, economists, philosophers, jurists, and natural scientists.&lt;ref name=Intro9 /&gt; He was head of the IKP from 1921 to 1931.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

Pokrovsky also was a co-founder of the Russian Association of Social Science Research Institutes (RAION), a sort of think tank which allowed non-Marxist scholars to engage in sociological research projects.&lt;ref name=Intro9 /&gt; Pokrovsky was a consistent advocate of bringing moderate critics of the regime into the educational establishment, unsuccessfully attempting to gain teaching positions at Moscow University for prominent Menshevik intellectuals [[Iulii Martov]] and [[Nikolai Sukhanov]].&lt;ref name=Intro11&gt;Szporluk, "Introduction," pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 Pokrovsky was chosen as the first president of the Society of Marxist Historians and was for a time also the editor of its journal, ''Istorik-marksist.''&lt;ref name=Intro9 /&gt; He was also a founder of the Central State Archives of the RSFSR and the editor of its journal, ''[[Krasnyi arkhiv]]'' (Red Archive), one of the major scholarly history publications of the Soviet 1920s.&lt;ref name=Intro10&gt;Szporluk, "Introduction," pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Pokrovsky was elected to the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]]. He achieved his highest position in the Communist Party apparatus the following year, when he was named as a member of the presidium of the Central Control Commission, a disciplinary body elected and sitting in parallel to the governing Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party.&lt;ref name=Intro9 /&gt; Pokrovsky was also a member of the All-Union and All-Russian Central Executive Committees of Soviets,&lt;ref name=Intro9 /&gt; officially non-party bodies which atrophied in importance over time.

===Historical ideas===

In his own historigraphic writing, Pokrovsky emphasized [[Marxist]] theory and the brutality of the upper classes in his ''Russian History from the Most Ancient Times'' (1910–13), downplaying the role of personality in favor of [[economics]] and the [[class struggle]] as the driving force of history.

Pokrovsky also wrote a ''Brief History of Russia'', published in 1920 to much acclaim from [[Vladimir Lenin]], who said in the preface to the first edition that he "like[d] the book immensely".

===Death and legacy===

Mikhail Pokrovsky died of cancer on April 10, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;David Brandenberger, "Politics Projected into the Past: What Precipitated the Anti-Pokrovskii Campaign?" in Ian D. Thatcher (ed.), ''Reinterpreting Revolutionary Russia: Essays in Honour of James D. White.'' Houndmills, England: Palgrave, 2006; pg. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pokrovsky's death was followed by efforts to marginalize his rejection of a patriotic national history populated by individual heroes and villains, an approach made popular in Soviet history writing in Pokrovsky's four volume work ''Russian History in Its Most Condensed Form.''&lt;ref&gt;Brandenberger, "Politics Projected into the Past," pg. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1934 the [[Politburo]] of the Russian Communist Party took up the question of national history textbooks, with General Secretary [[Joseph Stalin]] forcefully opining that Pokrovsky's influence had been decisive in propagating an overly abstract and schematic presentation of national history.&lt;ref name=Brand204&gt;Brandenberger, "Politics Projected into the Past," pg. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of scholars were put to the task of writing a new standard history textbook in 1934 and 1935.&lt;ref name=Brand204 /&gt; Despite the intense effort, no single book satisfactory to the regime was produced during these years.&lt;ref name=Brand204 /&gt;

In January 1936 another history textbook commission was launched, this chaired by [[Andrei Zhdanov]] and including a number of top Communist Party functionaries, including [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Karl Radek]], [[Yakov Yakovlev]], and [[Karl Bauman]], among others.&lt;ref name=Brand204 /&gt; In conjunction with the work of this commission, Bukharin authored  a lengthy critique of Pokrovsky and his methodology, accusing the deceased historian of mechanistic adherence to abstract sociological formulas, failure to properly understand and apply the [[dialectic|dialectic method]], and a tendency to depict history as a crudely universal process.&lt;ref&gt;Brandenberger, "Politics Projected into the Past," pg. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The Zhdanov Commission, in consultation with Stalin, issued an influential communique which categorized historians of the Pokrovsky school as conduits of harmful ideas that were at root "anti-Marxist, anti-Leninist, essentially liquidatorist, and anti-scientific."&lt;ref&gt;"V Sovnarkome Soiuza SSSR is TsK VKP(b),'' RGASPI, fond 558, opis 1, delo 3156, listy 11-12; quoted in Brandenberger, "Politics Projected into the Past," pg. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pokrovsky's relentless attack on the [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] old regime as a "prison of peoples" and "international gendarme" was henceforth deemed to be anti-patriotic "national nihilism" and a new Russian nationalist historical orthodoxy was established.&lt;ref name=Brand208&gt;Brandenberger, "Politics Projected into the Past," pg. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; This new official orthodoxy remained in place for the duration of Stalin's life.&lt;ref name=Brand208 /&gt;

Only after the Soviet leader's death and the subsequent renouncement of his policies by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] did Pokrovsky's work regain some influence among academic historians in the USSR. Although regarded as a rigid Marxist [[polemic]]ist by his critics, Pokrovsky is also acknowledged as a "conscientious scholar who would not sacrifice intellectual honesty to the demands of propaganda" by others, leaving his an ambiguous legacy.&lt;ref&gt;Roman Szporluk, "Introduction," pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stará Lubovna 8.jpg|thumb|300px|An aerial photograph of the open-air museum at [[Stará Ľubovňa]], [[Slovakia]]]]

An '''open-air museum''' (or '''open air museum''') is a [[museum]] that exhibits collections of buildings and artifacts out-of-doors. They are also frequently known as '''museums of buildings''' or [[folk museum]]s.

The concept of an open-air museum originated in [[Scandinavia]] in the late 19th century and spread widely. A comprehensive history of the open-air museum as an idea and institution can be found in Swedish museologist [[Sten Rentzhog]]'s 2007 book ''Open Air Museums: The History and Future of a Visionary Idea''.

Living history museums, including '''living farm museums''' and ''[[living museum]]s'', open-air museums where costumed interpreters portray period life in an earlier era. The interpreters act as if they are living in a different time and place and perform everyday household tasks, crafts, and occupations. The goal is to demonstrate older lifestyles and pursuits to modern audiences. Household tasks might include cooking on an open [[hearth]], [[Churning (butter)|churning butter]], [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning wool]] and [[weaving]], and farming without modern equipment. Many living museums feature traditional craftsmen at work, such as a [[blacksmith]], [[tinsmith|pewtersmith]], [[silversmith]], [[Weaving|weaver]], [[Tanner (occupation)|tanner]], [[armorer]], [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]], [[Pottery|potter]], [[miller]], [[sawyer (occupation)|sawyer]], [[joiner|cabinet-maker]], [[woodcarver]], [[Printing press|printer]], doctor and [[general store|general store keeper]].

==Definition==
''Open air'' is “The unconfined atmosphere…outside buildings…”&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the loosest sense, an open-air museum is any institution that includes one or more buildings in its collections, including farm museums, [[historic house museum]]s, and [[archaeological open-air museum]]s. Mostly ''open-air museum'' is applied to museums that specialize in the collection and re-erection of multiple old buildings at large outdoor sites, usually in settings of re-created landscapes of the past and often include [[living history]]. They may therefore be described as building museums. European open-air museums tended to be originally in regions where wooden architecture prevailed, as wooden structures may be trans-located without substantial loss of authenticity.

Common to all open-air museums, including the earliest ones of the 19th century, is the teaching of the history of everyday living by people from all segments of society.

==Origins==
[[File:Skansen, Stockholm, Sweden WDL2622.png|thumb|A view of [[Skansen]], the first open-air museum, in {{circa}}1900]]
The idea of the open-air museum dates to the 1790s. The first proponent of the idea was the Swiss thinker [[Charles Victor de Bonstetten|Charles de Bonstetten]] and was based on a visit to an exhibit of peasant costumes in the [[park of Frederiksborg Castle]] in [[Denmark]].{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}} He believed that traditional peasant houses should be preserved against modernity but failed to attract support for the idea.{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}}

The first major steps towards the creation of open-air museums was taken in [[Norway]] in 1867 when a private citizen transferred some historic farm buildings to a site near [[Oslo]] (Christiania) for public viewing.{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}} This, in turn, inspired [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II]] in 1881 to establish his own collection nearby, later inherited by the [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History|Norwegian Folk Museum]].{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}} The similar [[Nordic Museum]], was founded in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] soon afterwards.{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}} In 1891, the first major open-air museum was founded at [[Skansen]], in [[Stockholm]], as a part of the Nordic Museum.{{sfn|Hurt|1978|p=368}} The Skansen museum included farm buildings from across [[Scandinavia]], folk costumes, live animals, folk music, and demonstrations of folk crafts.{{sfn|Hurt|1978|pp=368-9}} The success of Skansen ensured that the open-air museum idea spread to countries across the world.

Most open-air museums concentrate on rural culture. However, since the opening of the first town museum, [[The Old Town, Aarhus|The Old Town]] in [[Aarhus]], [[Denmark]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dengamleby.dk/int/english.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218122006/http://www.dengamleby.dk/int/english.htm |archivedate=2010-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; town culture has also become a scope of open-air museums. In many cases new town quarters are being constructed in existing rural culture museums.

==North American innovations==
[[File:Williamsburg Virginia11.jpg|thumb|Traditional buildings in [[Colonial Williamsburg]]]]
The North American open-air museum, more commonly called a living history museum, had a different, slightly later origin than the European, and the visitor experience is different. The first was [[Henry Ford]]'s [[Greenfield Village]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]] (1928), where Ford intended his collection to be “a pocket edition of America”.&lt;ref name="Hudson"&gt;Kenneth Hudson, ''Museums of Influence'', Cambridge University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|153}} But it was [[Colonial Williamsburg]] (opened in 1934) which had a greater influence on museum development in North America. It influenced such projects through the continent as [[Mystic Seaport]], [[Plimoth Plantation]], and [[Fortress Louisbourg]]. What tends to differentiate the North American from the European model is the approach to interpretation. In Europe, the tendency is to usually focus on the buildings.

In North America, many open-air museums include interpreters who dress in period costume and conduct period crafts and everyday work.&lt;ref name="Hudson"/&gt;{{rp|154}} The living museum is therefore viewed as an attempt to recreate to the fullest extent conditions of a [[culture]], [[natural environment]] or [[history|historical period]]. The objective is immersion, using exhibits so that visitors can experience the specific culture, environment or historical period using the physical senses.

Performance and historiographic practices at American living museums have been critiqued in the past several years by scholars in anthropology and theater for creating false senses of authenticity and accuracy, and for neglecting to bear witness to some of the darker aspects of the American past (e.g., slavery and other forms of injustice). Even before such critiques were published, sites such as Williamsburg and others had begun to add more interpretation of difficult history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Magelssen]], ''Living History Museums: Undoing History Through Performance'', Scarecrow Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Shaughnessy was a major exponent of [[Samuel Beckett]], both in Australia and in Ireland. He produced the first ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' in Australia in 1957. He played Krapp in the Australian premier of ''Krapp's Last Tape'' at the Arts Theatre in Melbourne in 1959. He also toured a second production of [[Waiting for Godot|Godot]] in Sydney and Canberra in 1969, and later directed the Irish premières of ''[[Not I]]'' (1978), ''[[Footfalls]]'' (1978), and ''[[Rockaby]]'' (1984), and the unofficial world premiers of ''Theatre I'' and ''Theatre II'' (later published in modified form as ''Rough for Theatre I and II'') in Cambridge in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Smith and Chris Akerley,[https://anu.academia.edu/russellsmith/Papers/1121177/Samuel_Becketts_Reception_in_Australia_and_New_Zealand_with_Chris_Ackerley_._Matthew_Feldman_and_Mark_Nixon_eds._The_International_Reception_of_Samuel_Beckett._London_Continuum_2009._108-128 "Samuel Beckett's Reception in Australia and New Zealand"], The International Reception of Samuel Beckett, London, Continuum 2009, pp 108–128 (Martin Feldman and Mark Dixon eds).&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Shaughnessy was also noted for his one-act performances of ''[[Diary of a Madman (short story)|Diary of a Madman]]'', adapted from [[Gogol]]. In 1968 he co-created an illustrated anthology, ''The Restless Years'', based on his award-winning television program of the same name (not to be confused with the 1977–81 soap opera ''[[The Restless Years]]''). After making significant inroads to bring [[Shakespeare]] to Australian audiences in the 1960s, his Australian career was cut short after a libelous review published in ''[[The Australian]]'' by [[Katharine Brisbane]]. After a trial and an unsuccessful appeal, the case was ultimately determined in the [[High Court of Australia]], where he was vindicated.&lt;ref name="libelsuit"&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1970/52.html "O'Shaughnessy v. Mirror Newspaper Ltd"] (1970) 125 CLR 166, austlii.edu.au; at pages 172-77.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he could no longer work in Australia. In 1970 he left for London and continued to act in and direct Shakespeare in the UK and Ireland. For [[The British Council]] he has lectured on the plays of Shakespeare to universities in many countries of Europe, and in West Africa and South America. As a historian, his two books on General [[Joseph Holt]] and his book on John Mitchel are significant contributions to Australian/Irish history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UK2.NET|url=http://peteroshaughnessy.info|title=Peter O'Shaughnessy|publisher=Peteroshaughnessy.info|accessdate=1 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102064742/http://peteroshaughnessy.info/|archivedate=2 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaboration with Barry Humphries==
One of O'Shaughnessy's lasting legacies was his mentoring of the young [[Barry Humphries]] who has acknowledged that, "without O'Shaughnessy's nurturing and promotion, the character of [[Edna Everage]] would have been nipped in the bud after 1956 and never come to flower, while the character of [[Sandy Stone (Barry Humphries character)|Sandy Stone]] would never have taken shape as a presence on the stage".&lt;ref&gt;Barry Humphries. ''More Please'' (1992) Viking, pp 176–77&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With O'Shaughnessy's encouragement, the character (Everage) ... developed considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stone,[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/131760/20120120-0944/www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2003/jan03/story-3.pdf "Bunyippy Traits"], ''National Library of Australia News'' 2003, Vol XIII, No 4, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1957, he staged the first Australian production of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' at the Arrow Theatre in Melbourne with himself as [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] and Humphries as [[Estragon]]. It proved a hit with both audiences and critics. The critic of the [[Melbourne]] ''Sun'' wrote "so engrossing and well-done is this extraordinary adventure by Samuel Beckett regimented by Peter O'Shaughnessy's tender care that for me the evening passed by on wings". Later in the same year, O'Shaughnessy planned a production of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' for December, in tandem with a children's play to be performed at matinees. Part of the idea for a bush story involving a bunyip came from [[Frank Dalby Davison]]'s book ''Children of the Dark People'' in which Old Man Bunyip is a wise guardian of the bush. After rejecting various scripts, O'Shaughnessy, Humphries and two radio scriptwriters, Jeff Underhill and Don Whitelock, produced their own script, which became ''The Bunyip and the Satellite''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/131760/20120120-0944/www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2003/jan03/story-3.pdf "Bunyippy Traits"], pandora.nla.gov.au; accessed 16 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The children's show was a hit, and Humphries' performance as the Bunyip widely praised. O'Shaughnessy himself wrote that "Barry's performance as The Bunyip was the finest and most touching he had ever given in the theatre, and the character very close to his secret heart." Humphries described his creation as a "prancing bird-like clown with a falsetto that inevitably got huskier after twelve performances a week".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In an interview in the Australian magazine ''Theatre'' in 1960, Humphries went further by linking the bush creature with another of his recent creations, the suburban denizen Edna Everage: 'I notice Mrs Everage sometimes behaves in a slightly Bunyippy way ... she gives a spasmodic leap, which I subsequently recognise as a rather bunyippy trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10200917?sortby=dateDesc&amp;q&amp;l-decade=183&amp;c=collection|title=Papers of Peter O'Shaughnessy, [manuscript&amp;#93;|publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Court Case==
O'Shaughnessy received a scathing review for the 1967 Sydney production of ''[[Othello]]'', which he directed and starred as Othello, from theatre critic for ''[[The Australian]]'', [[Katharine Brisbane]]. She said, in part: "Stupidity and lack of talent are forgivable; brave failures are deserving of praise – these are every day human failings. But the waste and dishonesty of this production ... made me very angry indeed."&lt;ref name="libelsuit"/&gt; The case for O'Shaughnessy was argued before the High Court by 27-year-old junior counsel [[Mary Gaudron]] (later a High Court judge) in her first High Court case after O'Shaughnessy sacked [[Clive Evatt]]. According to O'Shaughnessy, "she cut a valiant figure, this 'slip of a girl', who stood unsupported before the five legal elders of the land. They were obviously impressed by her courage, her sheer elegant dash, her shining intellect finding expression in felicitous language, her good manners, charm, poise. And perhaps, when all is said and done, by her sheer cheek in taking on the case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://peteroshaughnessy.info|title=Peter O'Shaughnessy profile|publisher=Peteroshaughnessy.info|accessdate=1 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102064742/http://peteroshaughnessy.info/|archivedate=2 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won a unanimous judgment, successfully arguing that Brisbane had imputed that he had promoted his performance at the expense of his fellow actors, and that it was open to the jury to find that the use of the word 'dishonest' imputed such a dishonourable motive and therefore could be viewed as a statement of fact which had to be justified by evidence of which there was none to that effect. In a joint judgment, [[Garfield Barwick|Barwick]], McTiernan, Menzies and Owen wrote: "This is one of those cases where the critic, in making her evaluation that the production was a disaster ... did not plainly confine herself to commenting upon facts truly stated; she wrote what could, we think, have been regarded as amounting to a defamatory statement of fact, viz. that the producer dishonestly suppressed the roles of other players to highlight his own role."&lt;ref name="libelsuit"/&gt;

In a separate judgment, [[Victor Windeyer|Windeyer]] went further: "the matter published by the respondent in its newspaper was a vigorous, and in parts abusive criticism of a public performance of 'Othello'".&lt;ref name="libelsuit"/&gt; The court held this was not fair comment on the performance as such, and ordered a retrial. However, the case did not go back to court. The newspaper settled with O'Shaughnessy. However, it had a lasting impact on O'Shaughnessy's career, for he left for London shortly afterwards effectively ending his career on the Australian stage. As for Brisbane, she saw it the making of her career: "So they settled ... which was a bit sad. But after that my columns were read."&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie Higson, [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/the-journey-from-stage-to-page/story-e6frg8n6-1226101554404 "The journey from stage to page"], theaustralian.com.au, 26 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 Australia Day Honours List, O'Shaughnessy was awarded an [[Order of Australia Medal]] (OAM) "for service to the performing arts as a writer, theatre director, actor, historian and folklorist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1147128&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true Honour Roll], itsanhonour.gov.au, 26 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Maurice Marie Duhem''' ({{IPA-fr|pjɛʁ moʁis maʁi dy.ɛm|lang|Pierre duhem pronunciation.ogg}}; 9 June&lt;ref&gt;Jaki, Stanley L. (1987). ''Uneasy Genius: The Life and Work of Pierre Duhem''. Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 1861 – 14 September 1916) was a [[France|French]] [[physics|physicist]], [[mathematics|mathematician]], [[history of science|historian]] and [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]].  He is best known for his work on [[chemical thermodynamics]], for his philosophical writings on the indeterminacy of experimental criteria, and for his historical research into the science of the European [[Middle Ages]].  As a scientist, Duhem also contributed to [[hydrodynamics]] and to the theory of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].

Duhem's views on the philosophy of science are explicated in his 1906 work ''The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory''.&lt;ref name=aim&gt;{{cite book|last=Duhem|first=Pierre|author2=Philip P. Wiener|others=Jules Vuillemin|trans-title=The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory|title=La Théorie Physique: son Objet et sa Structure|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1954|isbn=978-0-691-02524-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, he opposed [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s statement that the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'s'' [[Newton's Law of Gravity|law of universal mutual gravitation]] was [[Deductive reasoning|deduced]] from '[[phenomena]]', including [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s second and third laws. Newton's claims in this regard had already been attacked by critical proof-analyses of the German logician [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and then most famously by [[Immanuel Kant]], following [[David Hume|Hume]]'s logical critique of [[inductive reasoning|induction]]. But the novelty of Duhem's work was his proposal that Newton's theory of universal mutual gravity flatly ''contradicted'' Kepler's Laws of planetary motion because the interplanetary mutual gravitational [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s caused deviations from Keplerian [[orbit]]s. Since no [[proposition]] can be [[Validity (logic)|validly]] logically deduced from any it contradicts, according to Duhem, Newton must not have logically deduced his law of gravitation directly from Kepler's Laws.&lt;ref name=aim/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakatos|first=Imre|author2=Paul Feyerabend |author3=Matteo Motterlini |title=For and Against Method: Including Lakatos's Lectures on Scientific Method and the Lakatos-Feyerabend Correspondence|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1999|pages=45–49|isbn=978-0-226-46774-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakatos|first=Imre|author2=John Worrall |author3=Gregory Currie |title=The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980|chapter=5: Newton's Effect on Scientific Standards|isbn=978-0-521-28031-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakatos|first=Imre|author2=John Worrall |author3=Gregory Currie |title=Mathematics, Science, and Epistemology|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1978|chapter=5: The Method of Analysis-Synthesis|isbn=978-0-521-21769-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duhem's name is given to the under-determination or [[Duhem–Quine thesis]], which holds that for any given set of observations there is an innumerably large number of explanations. It is, in essence, the same as Hume's critique of induction: all three variants point at the fact that [[empirical evidence]] cannot ''force'' the choice of a theory or its revision. Possible alternatives to induction are Duhem's [[instrumentalism]] and [[Karl Popper|Popper's]] thesis that we learn from [[Falsifiability|falsification]].

As popular as the Duhem–Quine thesis may be in the [[philosophy of science]], in reality Pierre Duhem and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] stated very different theses. Pierre Duhem believed that experimental theory in [[physics]] is fundamentally different from fields like [[physiology]] and certain branches of [[chemistry]]. Also Duhem's conception of theoretical group has its limits, since not all concepts are connected to each other logically. He did not include at all ''a priori'' disciplines such as [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] within these theoretical groups in physics which can be tested experimentally. Quine, on the other hand, conceived this theoretical group as a unit of a whole human knowledge. To Quine, even mathematics and logic must be revised in light of recalcitrant experience, a thesis that Duhem never held.

Duhem's philosophy of science was criticized by one of his contemporaries, [[Abel Rey]], in part because of what Rey perceived as influence on the part of Duhem's Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;Page 2018, p.
 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to the English inductivist tradition===
Duhem argues that physics is subject to certain methodological limitations that do not affect other sciences. In his ''The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory''&lt;ref name=aim/&gt; (1914), Duhem provided a devastating critique of [[Baconian method|Baconian]] crucial experiments. According to this critique, an experiment in physics is not simply an observation, but rather an interpretation of observations by means of a theoretical framework. Furthermore, no matter how well one constructs one's experiment, it is impossible to subject an isolated single hypothesis to an experimental test. Instead, it is a whole interlocking group of hypotheses, background assumptions, and theories that is tested. This thesis has come to be known as [[confirmation holism]]. This inevitable holism, according to Duhem, renders crucial experiments impossible. More generally, Duhem was critical of Newton's description of the method of physics as a straightforward "deduction" from facts and observations.

In the appendix to ''The Aim and Structure'', entitled "Physics of a Believer," Duhem draws out the implications that he sees his philosophy of science as having for those who argue that there is a conflict between physics and religion. He writes, "metaphysical and religious doctrines are judgments touching on objective reality, whereas the principles of physical theory are propositions relative to certain mathematical signs stripped of all objective existence. Since they do not have any common term, these two sorts of judgments can neither contradict nor agree with each other" (p.&amp;nbsp;285). Nonetheless, Duhem argues that it is important for the theologian or "metaphysician" to have detailed knowledge of physical theory in order not to make illegitimate use of it in speculations.

==History of science==
[[File:Oresme-Nicole.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Nicole Oresme]], a prominent medieval scholar. Duhem came to regard the medieval scholastic tradition as the origin of modern science.]]

Duhem is well known for his work on the [[history of science]],&lt;ref&gt;"Pierre Duhem, himself a distinguished physicist, initiated in heroic fashion, almost singlehandedly, the modern study of the history of medieval science by the simple but effective expedient of reading and analyzing as many medieval scientific manuscripts as possible." — Palter, Robert M. (1961). [https://archive.org/stream/towardmodernscie001652mbp#page/n3/mode/2up Preface to ''Toward Modern Science''], Vol. I. New York: The Noonday Press, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Harry W. (1972). "Pierre Duhem: Science and the Historian's Craft," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 33, pp. 497–512.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, John E. (1991). "Pierre Duhem and the History of Late Medieval Science and Philosophy in the Latin West," in R. Imbach &amp; A. Maierù, eds., ''Gli Studi di Filosofia Medievale fra Otto e Novecento''. Rome: Edizioni di Estoria e Letteratura, pp. 253–302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"By his numerous publications, Duhem made medieval science a respectable research field and placed the late Middle Ages in the mainstream of scientific development. He thus filled the hiatus that had existed between Greek and Arabic science, on the one extreme, and early modern science in the seventeenth-century Europe, on the other. For the first time, the history of science was provided with a genuine sense of continuity." — Grant, Edward (1996). ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages''. Cambridge University Press, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the ten volume ''Le système du monde: histoire des doctrines cosmologiques de Platon à Copernic'' (''The System of World: A History of Cosmological Doctrines from Plato to Copernicus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duhem|first=Pierre|title=Le système du monde: histoire des doctrines cosmologiques de Platon à Copernic'' (''The System of World: A History Cosmological Doctrines from Plato to Copernicus)|year=1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many former historians (e.g. [[Voltaire]] and [[Condorcet]]), who denigrated the [[Middle Ages]], he endeavored to show that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had helped foster Western science in one of its most fruitful periods. His work in this field was originally prompted by his research into the origins of [[statics]], where he encountered the works of medieval mathematicians and philosophers such as [[John Buridan]], [[Nicole Oresme]] and [[Roger Bacon]], whose sophistication surprised him. He consequently came to regard them as the founders of modern science, having in his view anticipated many of the discoveries of [[Galileo Galilei]] and later thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, William A. (1984). ''Prelude, Galileo and his Sources. The Heritage of the Collegio Romano in Galileo's Science''. N.J.: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Duhem concluded that "the mechanics and physics of which modern times are justifiably proud to proceed, by an uninterrupted series of scarcely perceptible improvements, from doctrines professed in the heart of the medieval schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Lindberg |editor-first1=David C. |editor-link1=David C.

Duhem popularized the concept of "[[saving the phenomena]]." In addition to the [[Copernican Revolution]] debate of "[[saving the phenomena]]" ([[Greek language|Greek]] σῴζειν τὰ φαινόμενα, ''sozein ta phainomena''&lt;ref name= "sozein ta phainomena"&gt;An ancient view (attributed to [[Plato]] by [[Simplicius of Cilicia]]) on hypotheses, theories and phaenomena, on what scientists, or more historically accurately (ancient) astronomers, are for, are supposed to do; see

[[Andreas Osiander]]'s [[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium#Ad lectorem|''Ad lectorem'' introduction]] to [[Copernicus]]'s ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; versus offering explanations&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Duhem thinks "[[Kepler]] is, unquestionably, the strongest and most illustrious representative of that tradition," i.e., the tradition of [[Philosophical realism|realism]], that physical theories offer explanations in addition to just "saving the phenomena."&lt;/ref&gt; that inspired Duhem was [[St. Thomas Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas]], who wrote, regarding [[Deferent and epicycle|eccentrics and epicycles]], that&lt;blockquote&gt;Reason may be employed in two ways to establish a point: firstly, for the purpose of furnishing sufficient proof of some principle. [...] Reason is employed in another way, not as furnishing a sufficient proof of a principle, but as confirming an already established principle, by showing the congruity of its results, as in astronomy the theory of [[Deferent and epicycle|eccentrics and epicycles]] is considered as established, because thereby the sensible appearances of the heavenly movements can be explained; not, however, as if this proof were sufficient, forasmuch as some other theory might explain them. [...]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1032.htm#article1 I q. 32 a. 1] ad 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Thermodynamics==
Duhem is also known for his work in thermodynamics, being in part responsible for the development of what is known as the [[Gibbs–Duhem relation]] and the [[Duhem–Margules equation]]. Duhem thought that from the first principles of thermodynamics physicists should be able to derive all the other fields of physics—e.g., chemistry, mechanics, and electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pierre Duhem|work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duhem/|author=Roger Ariew|year=2007|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duhem, influenced by [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Macquorn Rankine]]'s "Outlines of the Science of Energetics",&lt;ref&gt;Macquorn Rankine (1855). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=uU8EAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Outlines of the Science of Energetics]," ''The Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal'', Vol. II, pp. 120–140.&lt;/ref&gt; carried out this project in ''Traité de l'Énergétique'' (1911) but was unable to subject electromagnetism to thermodynamic first principles.

With the physicist, philosopher and historian of science [[Ernst Mach]], Duhem also shared a scepticism with regard to the existence of atoms.&lt;ref&gt;See Hentschel (1988) on these and other parallels between Duhem and Mach, and on their correspondence.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teacher===
It was during his time as a teacher in Cabo Rojo that Ramón Marín started his career as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rzyA0BhHHCIC&amp;pg=PA13 ''Ramón Marín y su Tiempo.''] Socorro Girón.

{{Periods in English History}}

The '''Restoration''' of the English monarchy took place in the [[Stuart period]].  It began in 1660 when the [[English monarchy|English]], [[Scottish monarchy|Scottish]] and [[Irish monarchy|Irish monarchies]] were all restored under [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. This followed the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], also called [[the Protectorate]], that followed the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].

The term ''Restoration'' is used to describe both the actual event by which the monarchy was restored, and the period of several years afterwards in which a new political settlement was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CEE staff|2007|loc=[http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0841607.html Restoration]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is very often used to cover the whole reign of Charles II (1660–1685) and often the brief reign of his younger brother [[James II of England|James II]] (1685–1688).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|EB staff|2012|loc=[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/499715/Restoration Restoration]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain contexts it may be used to cover the whole period of the later Stuart monarchs as far as the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and the accession of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] in 1714;{{sfn|Yadav|2010}} for example [[Restoration comedy]] typically encompasses works written as late as 1710.

==The Protectorate==
The [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], which preceded the English Restoration, might have continued if [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]], who was made [[Lord Protector]] on his father's death, had been capable of carrying on his father's policies. Richard Cromwell's main weakness was that he did not have the confidence of the army. After seven months, an army faction known as the [[Wallingford House party]] removed him on 6 May 1659 and reinstalled the [[Rump Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keeble|2002|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=72kuP4EwoEIC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=%22Wallingford+House+party%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Wallingford%20House%20party%22&amp;f=false pp. 8–10]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Fleetwood]] was appointed a member of the [[English Committee of Safety|Committee of Safety]] and of the [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]], and one of the seven commissioners for the army. On 9 June 1659, he was nominated lord-general (commander-in-chief) of the army. However, his leadership was undermined in Parliament, which chose to disregard the army's authority in a similar fashion to the [[First English Civil War#End of the First War|post-First Civil War]] Parliament. A royalist uprising was planned for 1 August 1659, but it was foiled. However, [[George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer|Sir George Booth]] gained control of Cheshire; Charles II hoped that with Spanish support he could effect a landing, but none was forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hutton|2000|p=121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Booth held Cheshire until the end of August when he was defeated by [[John Lambert (General)|General Lambert]]. The [[Rump Parliament|Commons]], on 12 October 1659, [[Cashiering|cashiered]] General John Lambert and other officers, and installed Fleetwood as chief of a military council under the authority of the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]].&lt;ref name="EB-108"&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Lambert ordered that the doors of the House be shut and the members kept out. On 26 October a "Committee of Safety" was appointed, of which Fleetwood and Lambert were members. Lambert was appointed major-general of all the forces in England and Scotland, Fleetwood being general.&lt;ref name="EB-108"/&gt; The Committee of Safety sent Lambert with a large force to meet [[George Monck]], who was in command of the English forces in Scotland, and either negotiate with him or force him to come to terms.&lt;ref name=EB-108/&gt;

It was into this atmosphere that Monck, the governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland. Lambert's army began to desert him, and he returned to London almost alone. Monck marched to London unopposed. The Presbyterian members, excluded in [[Pride's Purge]] of 1648, were recalled, and on 24 December the army restored the [[Long Parliament]].&lt;ref name=EB-108/&gt; Fleetwood was deprived of his command and ordered to appear before Parliament to answer for his conduct. On 3 March 1660, Lambert was sent to the [[Tower of London]], from which he escaped a month later. He tried to rekindle the civil war in favour of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] by issuing a proclamation calling on all supporters of the "[[Good Old Cause]]" to rally on the battlefield of Edgehill, but he was recaptured by Colonel [[Richard Ingoldsby]], a participant in the [[regicide]] of Charles I who hoped to win a pardon by handing Lambert over to the new regime.&lt;ref name=EB-108/&gt; Lambert was incarcerated and died in custody on [[Guernsey]] in 1694; Ingoldsby was indeed pardoned.{{sfn|Firth|1892|p=10}}

==Restoration of Charles II==
[[File:Hendrick de Meijer 001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The departure of Charles II from Scheveningen (1660).]]
On 4 April 1660, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the [[Declaration of Breda]], in which he made several promises in relation to the reclamation of the crown of England. Monck organised the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], which met for the first time on 25 April. On 8 May it proclaimed that King Charles II had been the lawful monarch since the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] on 30 January 1649.{{sfn|''House of Commons''|1802a}} "Constitutionally, it was as if the last nineteen years had never happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2005|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles returned from exile, leaving [[the Hague]] on 23 May and landing at [[Dover]] on 25 May.&lt;ref name="pepysdiary23"&gt;[http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/04/23/index.php Pepys Diary 23 April 1661].&lt;/ref&gt; He entered London on 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday. To celebrate His Majesty's Return to his Parliament, 29 May was made a public holiday, popularly known as [[Oak Apple Day]].{{sfn|''House of Commons''|1802b}} He was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1661.&lt;ref name="pepysdiary23" /&gt;

Some contemporaries described the Restoration as "a divinely ordained miracle". The sudden and unexpected deliverance from usurpation and tyranny was interpreted as a restoration of the natural and divine order.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1978|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cavalier Parliament]] convened for the first time on 8 May 1661, and it would endure for over 17 years, finally being dissolved on 24 January 1679. Like its predecessor, it was overwhelmingly [[Cavalier|Royalist]]. It is also known as the Pensionary Parliament for the many pensions it granted to adherents of the King.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

The leading political figure at the beginning of the Restoration was [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]]. It was the "skill and wisdom of Clarendon" which had "made the Restoration unconditional".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1953|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Royalist exiles returned and were rewarded. [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]] returned to the service of England, became a member of the [[privy council]], and was provided with an annuity. [[George Goring, 1st Earl of Norwich]], returned to be the Captain of the King's guard and received a pension. [[Marmaduke Langdale]] returned and was made "[[Baron Langdale]]". [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|William Cavendish]], Marquess of Newcastle, returned and was able to regain the greater part of his estates. He was invested in 1666 with the [[Order of the Garter]] (which had been bestowed upon him in 1650), and was advanced to a [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|dukedom]] on 16 March 1665.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

==Commonwealth regicides and rebels==
{{refimprove|section|date=May 2018}}&lt;!--many paragraphs are not cited--&gt;
[[File:Major-General Thomas Harrison (General) in Cromwell's Army.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]], the first person found guilty of regicide during the Restoration]]
The [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act]], which became law on 29 August 1660, pardoned all past treason against the crown, but specifically excluded [[List of regicides of Charles I|those involved in the trial and execution of Charles I]]. Thirty-one of the [[List of regicides of Charles I#Commissioners|59 commissioners]] (judges) who had signed the death warrant in 1649 were living. The regicides were hunted down; some escaped but most were found and put on trial. Three escaped to the American colonies. [[New Haven, Connecticut]], secretly harbored Edward Whalley, William Goffe and John Dixwell, and after American independence named streets after them to honour them as forefathers of the American Revolution.{{sfn|Weight|Haggith|2014|pp=18–21}}

In the ensuing trials, twelve were condemned to death. [[Fifth Monarchists|Fifth Monarchist]] [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]], the first person found guilty of regicide, who had been the seventeenth of the 59 commissioners to sign the death warrant, was the first regicide to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] because he was considered by the new government still to represent a real threat to the re-established order. In October 1660, at [[Charing Cross]] or [[Tyburn]], London, ten were publicly hanged, drawn and quartered: Thomas Harrison, [[John Jones Maesygarnedd|John Jones]], [[Adrian Scrope]], [[John Carew (regicide)|John Carew]], [[Thomas Scot]], and [[Gregory Clement]], who had signed the king's death warrant; the preacher [[Hugh Peters]]; [[Francis Hacker]] and [[Daniel Axtell]], who commanded the guards at the king's trial and execution; and [[John Cooke (prosecutor)|John Cooke]], the solicitor who directed the prosecution.  The 10 judges who were on the panel but did not sign the death warrant were also convicted.{{sfn|McIntosh|1982|pp=195–216}}

[[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]], Judge [[Thomas Pride]], and Judge [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]] were posthumously [[Attainder|attainted]] for high treason. Because Parliament is a court, the highest in the land, a [[bill of attainder]] is a legislative act declaring a person guilty of treason or felony, in contrast to the regular judicial process of trial and conviction. In January 1661, the corpses of Cromwell, Ireton and Bradshaw were exhumed and hanged in chains at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]].

In 1661 [[John Okey]], one of the regicides who signed the death warrant of Charles I, was brought back from Holland along with [[Miles Corbet]], friend and lawyer to Cromwell, and [[John Barkstead]], former constable of the [[Tower of London]]. They were all imprisoned in the Tower. From there they were taken to Tyburn and hanged, drawn and quartered on 19 April 1662. A further 19 regicides were imprisoned for life.

[[John Lambert (General)|John Lambert]] was not in London for the trial of Charles I. At the Restoration, he was found guilty of high treason and remained in custody in [[Guernsey]] for the rest of his life. Sir [[Henry Vane the Younger]] served on the [[Council of State (England)|Council of State]] during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] even though he refused to take the oath which expressed approbation (approval) of the King's execution. At the Restoration, after much debate in Parliament, he was exempted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act. In 1662 he was tried for high treason, found guilty and beheaded on [[Tower Hill, London|Tower Hill]] on 14 June 1662.

===Regrant of certain Commonwealth titles===
{{further|Knights, baronets and peers of the Protectorate}}

The [[Instrument of Government]], [[The Protectorate]]'s written constitutions, gave to the [[Lord Protector (Cromwell)|Lord Protector]] the King's power to grant titles of honour. Over 30 new [[knighthood]]s were granted under the Protectorate. These knighthoods [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act|passed into oblivion]] upon the Restoration of Charles II, however many were regranted by the restored King.

Of the eleven Protectorate [[baronet]]cies, two had been previously granted by Charles I during the Civil War – but under [[Commonwealth (England)|Commonwealth]] legislation they were not recognised under the Protectorate (hence the Lord Protector's regranting of them), however when that legislation passed into oblivion these two baronets were entitled to use the baronetcies granted by Charles I – and Charles II regranted four more. Only one now continues: [[Williams-Bulkeley Baronets|Sir Richard Thomas Willy]], 14th baronet, is the direct successor of Sir Griffith Williams. Of the remaining Protectorate baronets one, Sir [[William Ellis (solicitor-general)|William Ellis]], was granted a knighthood by Charles II.

[[Edmund Dunch, Baron Burnell of East Wittenham|Edmund Dunch]] was created [[Baron]] Burnell of East Wittenham in April 1658, but this barony was not regranted. The male line failed in 1719 with the death of his grandson, also [[Edmund Dunch (Whig)|Edmund Dunch]], so no one can lay claim to the title.

The one hereditary [[viscount]]cy Cromwell created for certain,{{efn|Cromwell had intended to make [[Bulstrode Whitelocke]] a viscount but it is not clear if he so before he died}} (making [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Charles Howard]] Viscount Howard of Morpeth and Baron Gilsland) continues to this day. In April 1661, Howard was created [[Earl of Carlisle]], Viscount Howard of Morpeth, and Baron Dacre of Gillesland. The present Earl is a direct descendant of this Cromwellian creation and Restoration recreation.

==Venner rebellion (January 1661)==
On 6 January 1661, about 50 [[Fifth Monarchists]], headed by a wine-cooper named [[Thomas Venner]], tried to gain possession of London in the name of "King Jesus".  Most were either killed or taken prisoner; on 19 and 21 January 1661, Venner and 10 others were hanged, drawn and quartered for high [[treason]].

==Religious settlement==
The [[Church of England]] was restored as the national Church in England, backed by the [[Clarendon code#Clarendon Code|Clarendon Code]] and the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]]. People reportedly "pranced around [[May poles]] as a way of taunting the Presbyterians and Independents" and "burned copies of the [[Solemn League and Covenant]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2005|pp=52–53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration Britain==
Historian Roger Baker argues that the Restoration and Charles' coronation mark a reversal of the stringent Puritan morality, "as though the pendulum [of England's morality] swung from repression to licence more or less overnight".{{sfn|Baker|1994|p=85}} Theatres reopened after having been closed during the protectorship of [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Puritan]]ism lost its momentum, and the bawdy "[[Restoration comedy]]" became a recognisable genre.  In addition, women were allowed to perform on the commercial stage as professional actresses for the first time. In [[Scotland]], [[Episcopacy]] was reinstated.

To celebrate the occasion and cement their diplomatic relations, the Dutch Republic presented Charles with the [[Dutch Gift]], a fine collection of old master paintings, classical sculptures, furniture, and a yacht.

==End of the Restoration==
{{Main|Glorious Revolution}}
[[File:William III Landing at Brixham, Torbay, 5 November 1688.jpg|thumb|Equestrian portrait of [[William III of England|William III]] by [[Jan Wyck]], commemorating the start of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688]]
The [[Glorious Revolution]] ended the Restoration.  The Glorious Revolution which overthrew King James II of England was propelled by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder [[William III of England|William III of Orange-Nassau]] (William of Orange).  William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his accession to the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James' daughter.

In April 1688, James re-issued the ''[[Declaration of Indulgence]]'' and ordered all Anglican clergymen to read it to their congregations.  When seven bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, submitted a petition requesting the reconsideration of the King's religious policies, they were arrested and tried for seditious libel.  On 30 June 1688, a group of seven Protestant nobles invited the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]] to come to England with an army; by September it became clear that William would invade England.  When William arrived on 5 November 1688, James lost his nerve, declined to attack the invading Dutch and tried to flee to France.  He was captured in Kent; later, he was released and placed under Dutch protective guard.  Having no desire to make James a martyr, William, Prince of Orange, let him escape on 23 December.  James was received in France by his cousin and ally, [[Louis XIV]], who offered him a palace and a pension.

William convened a [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] to decide how to handle the situation.  While the Parliament refused to depose James, they declared that James, having fled to France had effectively abdicated the throne, and that the throne was vacant.  To fill this vacancy, James's daughter Mary was declared Queen; she was to rule jointly with her husband William, Prince of Orange, who would be king.  The English Parliament passed the [[Bill of Rights of 1689]] that denounced James for abusing his power.  The abuses charged to James included the suspension of the [[Test Acts]], the prosecution of the [[Seven Bishops]] for merely petitioning the crown, the establishment of a standing army, and the imposition of cruel punishments.  The bill also declared that henceforth no Roman Catholic was permitted to ascend the English throne, nor could any English monarch marry a Roman Catholic.

The '''Sacred Band of Thebes''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἱερός|Ἱερὸς]] [[wikt:λόχος|Λόχος]]}}, ''Hieròs [[Lokhos|Lókhos]]'') was a [[troop]] of select soldiers, consisting of 150 pairs of [[Homosexuality in ancient Greece|male lovers]] which formed the elite force of the [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Theban]] army in the 4th century BC. Its predominance began with its crucial role in the [[Battle of Leuctra]] in 371 BC. It was annihilated by [[Philip II of Macedon]] in the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC.

The earliest surviving record of the Sacred Band by name was in 324 BC, in the [[Attic orators|oration]] ''Against Demosthenes'' by the [[Athens|Athenian]] logographer [[Dinarchus]]. He mentions the Sacred Band as being led by the general [[Pelopidas]] and, alongside [[Epaminondas]] who commanded the army of Thebes (Boeotia), were responsible for the defeat of the Spartans at the decisive [[Battle of Leuctra]] (371 BC).&lt;ref name="shrimpton"&gt;{{cite journal|author=G.

[[Plutarch]] (46–120 AD), a native of the village of [[Chaeronea]], is the source of the most substantial surviving account of the Sacred Band.&lt;ref name="crompton"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Crompton|title =Homosexuality and Civilization|publisher =Harvard University Press|year =2006|isbn =9780674022331|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=OppMOxhxfL&amp;dq=Sacred%20Band%20of%20Thebes&amp;pg=PA70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plutarchLoeb"&gt;{{cite book|author=Plutarch (trans.

The exact date of the Sacred Band's creation and whether it was created before or after the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' of Plato (c. 424–347 BC) and the similarly titled ''[[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]]'' by his rival [[Xenophon]] (c. 430–354 BC), has also long been debated. The generally accepted date of the Sacred Band's creation is between 379 and 378 BC.&lt;ref name="armstrong"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Armstrong Percy, III|editor1=Beert C.

[[Herodotus]] (c.484–425 BC) and [[Thucydides]] (c. 460–395 BC) both record an elite force of 300 Thebans allied with the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] who were annihilated by [[History of Athens|Athenians]] in the [[Battle of Plataea]] (479 BC). Herodotus describes them as "the first and the finest" ({{lang|grc|πρῶτοι καὶ ἄριστοι}}) among Thebans. [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] also records 300 picked men ({{lang|grc|ἄνδρες ἐπίλεκτοι}}) present in the [[Battle of Delium]] (424 BC), composed of ''heníochoi'' ({{lang|grc|ἡνίοχοι}}, "[[chariot]]eers") and ''parabátai'' ({{lang|grc|παραβάται}}, "those who walk beside"). Though none of these mention the Sacred Band by name, these may have referred to the Sacred Band or at least its precursors.&lt;ref name="rockwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leitao"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Leitao|editor1=Martha Craven Nussbaum |editor2=Juha Sihvola |title =The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome|chapter=The Legend of the Sacred Band|publisher =University of Chicago Press|year =2002|pages=143–169|isbn =9780226609157|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAiNHQVPlaMC&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;ots=ylLLk71FvR&amp;dq=Phaedimus%20Sacred%20band%20of%20thebes&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=Phaedimus%20Sacred%20band%20of%20thebes&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian John Kinloch Anderson believes that the Sacred Band was indeed present in Delium, and that Gorgidas did not establish it, but merely reformed it.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;

In the old debate surrounding Xenophon's and Plato's works, the Sacred Band has figured prominently as a possible way of dating which of the two wrote their version of ''Symposium'' first. Xenophon's Socrates in his ''Symposium'' disapprovingly mentions the practice of placing lovers beside each other in battle in the city-states of Thebes and [[Elis]], arguing that while the practice was acceptable to them, it was shameful for Athenians (both Plato and Xenophon were Athenians). According to the British classical scholar Sir [[Kenneth Dover]], this was a clear allusion to the Sacred Band, reflecting Xenophon's contemporary awareness of the Theban practice, albeit anachronistic as the dramatic date of the work itself is c. 421 BC.&lt;ref name="xenophon"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/Xenophon-sym.asp#VIII|title=Symposium|first=|publisher=|year=1897|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=But Pausanias, the lover of Agathon the poet, defended those who wallow together in licentiousness and said that an army composed of lovers and beloveds would be strongest. For he said that they would be ashamed to abandon each other in battle. But it would be quite extraordinary if those who are used to paying no attention to censure and to having no sense of shame before each other should nevertheless be ashamed to perform a shameful action. As proof he brought the example of the Thebans and the Eleans who are experienced with such things, and he claimed that even though they sleep with their beloveds, they still set them together in their ranks for battle. But there is no proof from this, for the situation is not similar: for them this practice is acceptable, but for us it is exceedingly shameful.|orig-year=c. 360 BC|author=[[Xenophon]] (trans. H.G.

He acknowledges, however, that Plato may have simply put the hypothesis in the mouth of Phaedrus according to the supposed earlier dramatic date of the work (c. 401 BC). It only shows that Plato was more mindful of his chronology in his ''Symposium'' than Xenophon, and proves that he was actually quite aware of the Sacred Band in his time.&lt;ref name="Danzig"/&gt;

== Composition ==
According to Plutarch, the 300 hand-picked men were chosen by Gorgidas purely for ability and merit, regardless of social class.&lt;ref name="devoto"/&gt; It was composed of 150 male couples,&lt;ref name="ludwig"/&gt; each pair consisting of an older ''erastês'' ({{lang|grc|ἐραστής}}, "lover") and a younger ''erômenos'' ({{lang|grc|ἐρώμενος}}, "beloved").&lt;ref name="plutarchD"/&gt; [[Athenaeus of Naucratis]] also records the Sacred Band as being composed of "lovers and their favorites, thus indicating the dignity of the god [[Eros]] in that they embrace a glorious death in preference to a dishonorable and reprehensible life";&lt;ref name="athenaeus"/&gt; while [[Polyaenus]] describes the Sacred Band as being composed of men "devoted to each other by mutual obligations of love".&lt;ref name="polyaenus"/&gt; The origin of the "sacred" appellation of the Sacred Band is unexplained by Dinarchus and other historians. But Plutarch claims that it was due to an exchange of sacred vows between lover and beloved at the shrine of [[Iolaus]] (one of the lovers of [[Hercules]]) at Thebes. He also tangentially mentions Plato's characterization of the lover as a "friend inspired of God".&lt;ref name="devoto"&gt;{{cite journal|author=James G. DeVoto|year=1992|title=The Theban Sacred Band|journal=The Ancient World|volume=23|issue=2|pages=3–19|url=http://www.arespublishers.com/ANCW.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plutarchD"/&gt;

The Sacred Band was stationed in [[Cadmea]] as a standing force, likely as defense against future attempts by foreign forces to take the citadel.&lt;ref name="rockwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ferrill"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Ferrill|editor1=A.

According to Plutarch, Gorgidas originally distributed the members of the Sacred Band among the front ranks of the [[phalanx]]es of regular infantry.&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen O.

Their main function was to cripple the enemy by engaging and killing their best men and leaders in battle.&lt;ref name="crompton2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="devoto"/&gt;

=== Invasions of Agesilaus II ===
The Sacred Band first saw action in 378 BC, at the beginning of the [[Boeotian War]]. It was during the famous stand-off between the Athenian [[mercenary]] commander (and later ''[[strategos]]'') [[Chabrias]] (d. 357 BC) and the Spartan King [[Agesilaus II]] (444 BC–360 BC).&lt;ref name="devoto"/&gt; Prior to the creation of the Sacred Band under Gorgidas, the Athenians had helped the Theban exiles retake control of Thebes and the citadel of Cadmea from Sparta. This was followed by Athens openly entering into an alliance with Thebes against Sparta. In the summer of 378 BC, Agesilaus led a Spartan expedition against Thebes from the Boeotian city of [[Thespiae]] (then still allied to Sparta).&lt;ref name="Munn"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark H. Munn|title =The Defense of Attica: The Dema Wall and the Boiotian War of 378-375 B.C.|publisher =University of California Press|year =1993|isbn =978-0520076853|url =http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft0q2n99ng/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spartan forces were held up for several days by Theban forces manning the earthen [[stockade]]s at the perimeter of Theban territory. The Spartans eventually breached the fortifications and entered the Theban countryside, devastating the Theban fields in their wake. Though the Athenians had by this time joined the Theban forces, they were still outnumbered by the Spartans. With the fall of the stockades, they were left with two choices, either to retreat back to the defensible walls of Thebes or to hold their ground and face the Spartans in the open. They chose the latter and arrayed their forces along the crest of a low sloping hill, opposite the Spartan forces. Gorgidas and the Sacred Band occupied the front ranks of the Theban forces on the right, while Chabrias and an experienced force of mercenary hoplites occupied the front ranks of the Athenian forces on the left.&lt;ref name="Munn"/&gt;

Agesilaus first sent out [[skirmisher]]s to test the combined Theban and Athenian lines.&lt;ref name="DiodorusXV"/&gt; These were easily dispatched by the Theban and Athenian forces, probably by their more numerous cavalry. Agesilaus then commanded the entire Spartan army to advance. He may have hoped that the sight of the massed Spartan forces resolutely moving forward would be enough to intimidate the Theban and Athenian forces into breaking ranks. The same tactic had worked for Agesilaus against [[Argos|Argive]] forces in the [[Battle of Coronea (394 BC)]].&lt;ref name="Munn"/&gt;

It was during this time that Chabrias gave his most famous command. With scarcely {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} separating the two armies, Agesilaus was expecting the Theban and Athenian forces to charge at any moment.&lt;ref name="Munn"/&gt; Instead, Chabrias ordered his men to [[stand at ease]].&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Duncan Campbell|title =Spartan Warrior 735-331 BC|publisher =Osprey Publishing|year =2012|pages=89–90|isbn =9781780968698|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlVimtrzA1UC&amp;lpg=PT67&amp;ots=jMlXyzejCv&amp;dq=Chabrias%20378%20BC&amp;pg=PT67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In unison, his mercenary hoplites immediately assumed the resting posture—with the spear remaining pointing upwards instead of towards the enemy, and the shield propped against the left knee instead of being hoisted at the shoulders.&lt;ref name="polyaenus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davies"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Kenyon Davies|title =Democracy and Classical Greece|publisher =Harvard University Press|year =1993|page=187|isbn =9780674196070|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KH_giBt9sysC&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;ots=MuwnXqVZn5&amp;dq=peltasts%20gorgidas&amp;pg=PA187#v=onepage&amp;q=peltasts%20gorgidas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorgidas, on seeing this, also commanded the Sacred Band to follow suit, which they did with the same military drill precision and confidence.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Kinloch Anderson|title =Military Theory and Practice in the Age of Xenophon|publisher =University of California Press|year =1970|pages=89–90,158|isbn =9780520015647|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OTW4E0Ti0_MC&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;ots=uJEZupp1tM&amp;dq=Chabrias%20Sacred%20Band&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q=Chabrias%20Sacred%20Band&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Munn"/&gt; The audacity of the maneuver and the discipline of the execution was such that Agesilaus halted the advance.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neposChab"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Cornelius Nepos]]|title = Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae|chapter=Chabrias|url =http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_text_nepos_comdrsiphicrateshabrias.htm#Chabrias}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing that his attempts to provoke the Theban and Athenian forces to fight on lower ground were unsuccessful, Agesilaus eventually thought it wiser to withdraw his forces back to Thespiae.&lt;ref name="polyaenus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DiodorusXV"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Diodorus Siculus]] (trans.

=== Battle of Tegyra ===
[[File:Boeotia ancient-en.svg|thumb|287px|Map of ancient [[Boeotia]] showing the location of the city of [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]]]]
{{Main article|Battle of Tegyra}}

As a single unit under Pelopidas, the first recorded victory of the Sacred Band was at the [[Battle of Tegyra]] (375 BC). It occurred near the Boeotian city of [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]], then still an ally of Sparta. Hearing reports that the Spartan garrison in Orchomenus had left for [[Locris]], Pelopidas quickly set out with the Sacred Band and a few cavalry, hoping to capture it in their absence. They approached the city through the northeastern route since the waters of [[Lake Copais]] were at their fullest during that season.&lt;ref name="plutarchD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pritchett"/&gt; Upon reaching the city, they learned that a new ''mora'' had been sent from Sparta to reinforce Orchomenus. Unwilling to engage the new garrison, Pelopidas decided to retreat back to Thebes, retracing their northeastern route along Lake Copais. However, they only reached as far as the shrine of [[Apollo]] of Tegyra before encountering the returning Spartan forces from Locris.&lt;ref name="buck"/&gt;

The Spartans were composed of two ''[[Mora (military unit)|morai]]'' led by the ''[[polemarch]]oi'' Gorgoleon and Theopompus.&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[P.J.

He then ordered his cavalry to ride up from the rear and charge while he reformed the Sacred Band into an abnormally dense formation, hoping to at least cut through the numerically superior Spartan lines. The Spartans advanced, confident in their numbers, only to have their leaders killed immediately in the opening clashes. Leaderless and encountering forces equal in discipline and training for the first time in the Sacred Band, the Spartans faltered and opened their ranks, expecting the Thebans to pass through and escape. Instead, Pelopidas surprised them by using the opening to [[Flanking maneuver|flank]] the Spartans.&lt;ref name="hutchinson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Godfrey Hutchinson|title =Xenophon and the Art of Command|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Xenophon_and_the_art_of_command.html?id=HgEdAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher =Stackpole Books|year =2000|page=234|isbn =9781853674174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spartans were completely routed, with considerable loss of life.&lt;ref name="plutarchD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaebel"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E.

They stripped the dead and set up a ''[[tropaion]]'' (τρόπαιον, a commemorative trophy left at the site of a battle victory) before continuing on to Thebes.&lt;ref name="devoto"/&gt; Having proven their worth, Pelopidas kept the Sacred Band as a separate tactical unit in all subsequent battles.&lt;ref name="rockwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plutarchD"/&gt;

An account of the battle was mentioned both by Diodorus and Plutarch, both based heavily on the report by Ephorus.&lt;ref name="Stylianou"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. J.

The exact number of the belligerents on each side varies by account. Diodorus puts the number of Thebans at 500 against the Spartans' 1,000 (each ''mora'' consisting of 500 men), apparently basing it on Ephorus' original figures. Plutarch puts the number of the Thebans at 300, and acknowledges three sources for the number of Spartans: 1000 by the account of Ephorus; 1,400 by [[Callisthenes]] (c. 360–328 BC); or 1,800 by [[Polybius]] (c. 200–118 BC). Some of these numbers may have been exaggerated due to the overall significance of the battle.&lt;ref name="Stylianou"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hornblower"/&gt; The battle, while minor, was remarkable for being the first time a Spartan force had been defeated in pitched battle, dispelling the myth of Spartan invincibility.&lt;ref name="rockwell"/&gt; It left a deep impression in Greece and boosted the morale among Boeotians, foreshadowing the later Battle of Leuctra.&lt;ref name="cartledge"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Cartledge|title =Sparta and Lakonia: A Regional History, 1300-362 BC|publisher =Routledge|year =2002|isbn =9780415262767|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgLxGd9c-00C&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;ots=Wg7an4cXZa&amp;dq=Sacred%20Band%20tegyra&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q=Sacred%20Band%20tegyra&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hornblower"/&gt; In Plutarch's own words:

{{Quote|For in all the great wars there had ever been against Greeks or barbarians, the Spartans were never before beaten by a smaller company than their own; nor, indeed, in a set battle, when their number was equal. Hence their courage was thought irresistible, and their high repute before the battle made a conquest already of enemies, who thought themselves no match for the men of Sparta even on equal terms. But this battle first taught the other Greeks, that not only Eurotas, or the country between Babyce and Cnacion,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Places where the Spartan Assembly met.&lt;/ref&gt; breeds men of courage and resolution; but that where the youth are ashamed of baseness, and ready to venture in a good cause, where they fly disgrace more than danger, there, wherever it be, are found the bravest and most formidable opponents.|Plutarch, ''Pelopidas'' 17&lt;ref name="plutarchD"/&gt;}}

Shortly after this, the Athenians initiated the [[Common Peace]] of 375 BC (Κοινὴ Εἰρήνη, ''Koine Eirene'') among Greek city-states. According to Xenophon, they were alarmed at the growing power of Thebes and weary of fending off Spartan fleets alone as the Thebans were not contributing any money to maintaining the Athenian fleet.&lt;ref name="rockwell"/&gt; However this broke down soon after in 374 BC, when Athens and Sparta resumed hostilities over [[Korkyra (polis)|Korkyra]] (modern [[Corfu]]).&lt;ref name="cartledge"/&gt; During this time period, Athens also gradually became hostile to Thebes.&lt;ref name="devoto"/&gt; While Athens and Sparta were busy fighting each other, Thebes resumed her campaigns against the autonomous pro-Spartan Boeotian ''[[Polis|poleis]]''.

In response to the Theban army outside the city's walls, the Phocian general [[Onomarchus]] brought out all the inhabitants of the city (including the elderly, women, and children) and locked the gates. He then placed the non-combatants directly behind the defenders of Elateia. On seeing this, Pelopidas withdrew his forces, recognizing that the Phocians would fight to the death to protect their loved ones.&lt;ref name="polyaenus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="devoto"/&gt;

By 371 BC, there was another attempt to revive [[the King's Peace]] to curb the rise of Thebes. It was initiated by either the Athenians or the Persians (perhaps at the prompting of the Spartans). The Spartans also sent a large force led by King [[Cleombrotus I]] (Sparta having [[List of kings of Sparta|two kings]] simultaneously for most of its history) to Phocis, ready to invade Boeotia if the Thebans refuse to attend the peace conference or accept its terms.&lt;ref name="terry"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Other historians believe that Cleombrotus was already in Phocis during this period, having been sent earlier in 375 BC to reinforce it during the early Theban attacks.

[[File:Epam1.jpg|thumb|A statue of the [[boeotarch]] [[Epaminondas]], who was widely hailed for his brilliant and revolutionary tactics in the [[Battle of Leuctra]].]]
The battle opened with a cavalry charge by both armies. The Spartan cavalry were quickly defeated by the superior Theban cavalry and were chased back to their own side. Their disorderly retreat disrupted the battle lines of the Spartan heavy infantry and, because of the resulting chaos and the dust stirred up, the Spartans were unable to observe the highly unusual advance of the Theban army until the very last moment.&lt;ref name="fine" /&gt; Epaminondas had ordered his troops to advance diagonally, such that the left wing of the Theban army (with its concentration of forces) would impact with the right wing of the Spartan army well before the other weaker phalanxes.&lt;ref name="seager" /&gt; The furthest right wing of the Theban phalanx was even retreating to make this possible.&lt;ref name="chriss" /&gt; This is the first recorded instance of the military formation later known as the [[oblique order]].&lt;ref name="vander"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maj. Kurt P. Vandersteen|title =Classical Theories and the Will to Fight|publisher =U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Illinois State University|year =1986|page=31|url =http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a397224.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;See also the German military tactic [[Blitzkrieg#Schwerpunkt|Schwerpunkt]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Theban cavalry also helped by continuing to carry out intermittent attacks along the Spartan battle lines, holding their advance back.&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;

By the time the Spartans realized that something unusual was happening it was already too late. Shortly before the Theban left wing made contact, the Spartans hastily stretched out their right wing in an attempt to outflank and engulf the rapidly approaching Thebans. This was a traditional tactic and, once the Thebans were in range, the stretched wing would then be brought back in an encircling movement. Acting under his own initiative, Pelopidas quickly led the Sacred Band ahead of the Theban left wing to intercept the Spartan maneuver before it could be completed.&lt;ref name="buckler" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some historians believe that Epaminondas explicitly ordered Pelopidas to intercept the Spartan right wing. (Chrissanthos, 2008; Gabriel, 2001) Others believe that this action was pre-planned (perhaps even rehearsed) and independently performed as part of the Sacred Band's role in the battle. (Jones, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; They succeeded in fixing the Spartans in place until the rest of the Theban heavy infantry finally smashed into the Spartan right wing. The sheer number of Thebans overwhelmed the Spartan right wing quickly. The number of Spartan casualties amounted to about 1,000 dead, among whom were 400 Spartiates and their own king. The Spartan right flank were forced to retreat (after retrieving the body of Cleombrotus). Seeing the spartiates fleeing in disarray, the perioeci phalanxes also broke ranks and retreated. Although some Spartans were in favor of resuming the battle in order to recover the bodies of their dead, the allied perioeci of the Spartan left wing were less than willing to continue fighting (indeed some of them were quite pleased at the turn of events). The remaining ''polemarchoi'' eventually decided to request a truce, which the Thebans readily granted. The Spartan dead were returned and a ''[[tropaion]]'' was set up on the battlefield by the Thebans to commemorate their victory.&lt;ref name="seager" /&gt;

According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (c. 2nd century AD), the Battle of Leuctra was the most decisive battle ever fought by Greeks against Greeks. Leuctra established Theban independence from Spartan rule and laid the groundwork for the expansion of Theban power, but possibly also for the eventual supremacy of Philip II of Macedon.

=== Battle of Chaeronea ===
{{Main article|Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)}}
Defeat came at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)]], the decisive contest in which [[Philip II of Macedon]], with his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], extinguished Theban hegemony.&lt;ref name="devoto"/&gt; The battle is the culmination of [[Rise of Macedon#Philip's final campaigns (339–338 BC)|Philip's campaign into central Greece]] in preparation for a war against Persia. It was fought between the Macedonians and their allies and an alliance of Greek city-states led by Athens and Thebes. Diodorus records that the numbers involved for the two armies were more or less equal, both having around 30,000 men and 2,000 cavalry.&lt;ref name=ab&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle of Chaeronea|url=http://www.arsbellica.it/pagine/antica/Cheronea/Cheronea_eng.html|website=Ars Bellica: The Great Battles of History|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[hoplite]] infantry was no match for the novel [[Sarissa|long-speared]] [[Macedonian phalanxes|Macedonian phalanx]]: the Theban army and its allies broke and fled, but the Sacred Band, although surrounded and overwhelmed, refused to surrender. The Thebans of the Sacred Band held their ground and Plutarch records that all 300 fell where they stood beside their last commander, [[Theagenes of Thebes|Theagenes]]. Their defeat at the battle was a significant victory for Philip, since until then, the Sacred Band was regarded as invincible throughout all of Ancient Greece. Plutarch records that Philip II, on encountering the corpses "heaped one upon another", understanding who they were, wept and exclaimed,

{{quote|Perish any man who suspects that these men either did or suffered anything unseemly.|Plutarch, ''Pelopidas'' 18&lt;ref name="plutarchD"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Plutarch]] (trans. [[John Dryden]], 1683)|title =Parallel Lives|chapter =Pelopidas|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_%28Dryden_translation%29/Pelopidas}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though the significance of the battle was well-documented by ancient scholars, there is little surviving information on the deployment of the armies involved. Most modern scholars (including [[N. G. L. Hammond]] and [[George Cawkwell]]) credit Alexander as having led a cavalry wing.&lt;ref name=ab/&gt; James G. DeVoto, likewise, says in ''The Theban Sacred Band'' that Alexander had deployed his cavalry behind the Macedonian hoplites, apparently permitting "a Theban break-through in order to effect a cavalry assault while his hoplites regrouped".&lt;ref name="devoto"/&gt; Other historians however argue that Alexander actually commanded hoplites armed with [[sarissa]]s (pikes), rather than cavalry, especially since Plutarch also mentions that the Sacred Band fell to "lances of the Macedonian phalanx". Plutarch and Diodorus both credit Alexander as being the first to engage the Sacred Band.&lt;ref name=ab/&gt;

Pausanias in his ''[[Pausanias (geographer)#Work|Description of Greece]]'' mentions that the Thebans had erected a gigantic statue of a lion near the village of [[Chaeronea]], surmounting the ''[[polyandrion]]'' ({{lang|grc|πολυάνδριον}}, common tomb) of the Thebans killed in battle against Philip.&lt;ref name="paus9Lion"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]|title =Description of Greece|chapter =Book IX|year =2nd century AD|url =http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias9B.html|quote=As you approach the city you see a common grave of the Thebans who were killed in the struggle against Philip.

In 1818, a British architect named [[George Ledwell Taylor]] spent a summer in Greece with two friends at [[Livadeia]]. On June 3, they decided to go horseback riding to the nearby village of Chaeronea using Pausanias' ''Description of Greece'' as a guidebook. Two hours away from the village, Taylor's horse momentarily stumbled on a piece of marble jutting from the ground. Looking back at the rock, he was struck by its appearance of being sculpted and called for their party to stop. They dismounted and dug at it with their riding-whips, ascertaining that it was indeed sculpture. They enlisted the help of some nearby farmers until they finally uncovered the massive head of a stone lion which they recognized as the same lion mentioned by Pausanias. Parts of the statue had broken off and a good deal of it still remained buried. They immediately reported their discovery when they returned to Athens.&lt;ref name="taylor1"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1863|title=On the discovery of the Lion at Chæronea, by a party of English travellers in 1818|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature of the United Kingdom|volume=3|series=Second Series|pages=1–12|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysbydiversha08royauoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dodg"&gt;{{cite book|author=Campbell Dodgson|title =Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 55|chapter =Taylor, George Ledwell|url =http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Taylor,_George_Ledwell_%28DNB00%29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821–1832), a Greek general{{who|date=August 2017}} damaged the monument by ordering that the pedestal be smashed, perhaps looking for treasure.

(Ashley, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians such as [[N. G. L. Hammond|Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond]], [[Karl Julius Beloch]], and [[Vincenzo Costanzi]] do not believe that the lion monument marks the location of the Sacred Band dead. Hammond claims it was the place where Philip turned his army around during the Battle of Chaeronea and believes that it contains the members of the Macedonian right flank who perished. He argues that it is highly improbable that the Thebans would be able to commemorate their dead within Philip's lifetime with such a massive and obviously expensive monument.&lt;ref name="pritchLion"/&gt;

The historian William Kendrick Pritchett criticizes Hammond's rationale as "subjective" and counters it with a passage from ''Historiarum Philippicarum Libri XLIV'' of the 3rd-century AD [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]. In addition to Pausanias and Strabo, Justin also clearly says that Philip forced the Thebans to pay for the privilege of burying (not cremating) their dead. Therefore, the cremated remains are likely to be Macedonian, while the remains around the lion were the Sacred Band. Philip, after all, was known for his ability to inflict unnecessary cruelty when it served a greater purpose. He further points out that questioning the honesty of Pausanias is unwarranted, as any well-informed Greek then would probably know the ascription of the monument even centuries after the battle; Pausanias' knowledge of topography was not second-hand and his testimony was echoed independently by other ancient sources such as Strabo and Justin.&lt;ref name="pritchLion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sabin"/&gt; Indeed, Pausanias' ''Description of Greece'' has proved to be an accurate and important guide to modern archeologists in rediscovering the locations of other ancient Greek monuments and buildings.&lt;ref name="habicht"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christian Habicht|title =Pausanias' Guide to Ancient Greece|chapter =Pausanias as a Guide|publisher =University of California Press|year =1999|pages=28–63|isbn = 9780520061705|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=9cJYpYbScEUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=USSSXq-Xpn&amp;dq=Pausanias%20Description%20of%20Greece%20archeology&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q=archaeology&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rubin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lene Rubinstein|editor1=Morgens Herman Hansen |editor2=Kurt Raaflaub |title =Studies in the Ancient Greek ''Polis'', Volume 1|chapter =Pausanias as a source for the classical Greek ''Polis''|publisher =Franz Steiner Verlag|year =1995|page=211|isbn =9783515067591|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=0xyNwS2q7CUC&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;ots=kaJ_u5BH1F&amp;dq=Pausanias%20Importance%20Archaeology&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=Pausanias%20Importance%20Archaeology&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elsner"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Jaś Elsner]]|year=2010|title=Special issue: Receptions of Pausanias: From Winckelmann to Frazer|journal=Classical Receptions Journal|volume=2|issue=2|pages=157–173|doi=10.1093/crj/clq012|url=http://crj.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/2/157.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trophy of the Battle of Leuktra ===
After the defeat of Cleombrotus' forces in the Battle of Leuktra, a ''[[tropaion]]'' was set up on the battlefield by the Thebans to commemorate their victory.&lt;ref name="seager"/&gt; The ''tropaion'' was later replaced by a permanent monument, an unprecedented move by the Thebans as ''tropaia'' were designed to be ephemeral.

== Historicity  ==
[[File:Plutarchs Lives Vol the Third 1727.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]'' (pictured: the 1727 edition of the English translation by [[André Dacier]]) is the main source for the most substantial surviving account of the Sacred Band. It is believed to be mostly based on the works of the Sacred Band contemporaries [[Callisthenes]] and [[Ephorus]]. Unfortunately the works of the latter two have been lost to history.]]
The historicity of the Sacred Band is largely accepted by historians; it is detailed in the writings of numerous classical authors, especially [[Plutarch]]. Noted classical historians like John Kinloch Anderson and [[George Cawkwell]] accept Plutarch's ''Life of Pelopidas'', which contains the most detailed account of the Sacred Band, as a highly reliable account of the events, in contrast to Xenophon's patchy treatment of Theban history.&lt;ref name="anderson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cawk"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Cawkwell|title =Scripta Antiquitatis Posterioris Ad Ethicam Religionemque Pertinentia.

W. Walbank|Frank William Walbank]] and [[Felix Jacoby]] have also defended Callisthenes' descriptions of land battles in the past. Walbank commented that his depictions of the [[Battle of the Eurymedon]], [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]], and Tegyra (all surviving through Plutarch) are quite adequate. While Jacoby, responding to claims that Callisthenes was unreliable in accounts of land battles in contrast to Xenophon, pointed out that Callisthenes did accurately describe the details on the Battle of Tegyra. He summarized his opinion of Callisthenes' account with "''Sie ist panegyrisch gehalten, aber sachlich nicht unrichtig.'' [It is panegyrical, but it is not factually incorrect.]"&lt;ref name="pritchett"/&gt; This is echoed by the historians [[John Buckler (historian)|John Buckler]] and [[Hans Beck (historian)|Hans Beck]] who conclude that "In sum, Plutarch's description of the battle of Tegyra does justice both to the terrain of Polygyra and to the information gleaned from his fourth-century sources. There is nothing implausible or unusual in Plutarch's account, and every reason to consider it one of the best of his battle pieces." They also had the same opinion of his account on Leuctra, dismissing assertions that his accounts were confused or rhetorical.&lt;ref name="buckler"/&gt;

The historian Gordon S. Shrimpton further provides an explanation for Xenophon's silence on much of Theban history. He notes that all the surviving contemporary accounts of Thebes during the period of Theban hegemony between 371 and 341 BC were often highly critical; with their failures ridiculed and their accomplishments usually being downplayed or omitted altogether. For instance, the Athenian [[Isocrates]] (436–338 BC) in his ''Plataicus'' (which details the destruction of Plataea by the Thebans), makes no mention of the Theban victory in Leuctra, and harshly reviles Thebes throughout. His later work ''Archidamus'' mention Leuctra briefly, and only to criticize Thebans as being incompetent and incapable of capitalizing on their rise to power. The same sentiments are echoed by the Athenians [[Demosthenes]] (384–322 BC) and [[Antisthenes]] (c. 445–365 BC). Xenophon, another Athenian, is the only contemporary who grudgingly notes some Theban accomplishments, and even then, never in-depth and with numerous omissions. His only mentions of Pelopidas and Epaminondas by name, for example, were very brief and shed no light on their previous accomplishments.&lt;ref name="shrimpton"/&gt; Indeed, the historians [[Bruce LaForse]] and John Buckler have noted that the character and accomplishments of Epaminondas were so unassailable that there is no known hostile account of him in ancient sources. The most unfriendly writers like Xenophon and Isocrates could do was omit his accomplishments in their work altogether.&lt;ref name="laforse"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce LaForse|editor =Konrad H. Kinzl|title =A Companion to the Classical Greek World|chapter =The Greek World, 371-336|publisher =John Wiley &amp; Sons|year =2010|page=546|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=loeWIRBo3isC&amp;lpg=PA548&amp;ots=ITY5KStsR1&amp;dq=Leuktra%20city&amp;pg=PA546#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shrimpton believes that the apparent indifference of earlier authors was due to the general hatred by other Greeks against the Thebans who had [[medized]] (i.e. allied with the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]) in the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second Persian invasion]] in 480 BC and again in 368 BC. Athenians, in particular, held a special contempt for Thebes due to the latter's actions in the [[Peloponnesian War]]; as well as the Thebans' destruction of Plataea in 373 BC, and the invasion of the Athenian-allied Boeotian city of [[Oropus]] in 366 BC. Demosthenes records this sentiment very clearly in a disclaimer in his speech ''[[On the Navy]]'' (354 BC): "It is difficult to speak to you about [Thebans], because you have such a hearty dislike of them that you would not care to hear any good of them, even if it were true."&lt;ref name="shrimpton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="demSymm"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0072%3Aspeech%3D14%3Asection%3D33|title=On the Navy|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=On the Symmories|orig-year=354 BC|author=[[Demosthenes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sentiment changed in 339 BC, when Thebes abruptly severed its alliance with Philip II (after being convinced by a speech from Demosthenes) and joined the Athenian-led Pan-Hellenic alliance against Macedonia. The result being the annihilation of the Sacred Band in Chaeronea and the destruction of the city of Thebes itself in 335 BC by the Macedonians. In light of these actions, Athenians eventually changed their opinions on Thebes, now regarding it in a sympathetic light as a fallen ally. It was during this period that much of the accounts favorable to Thebans were at last written. Works by authors like [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]], [[Aristoxenus]], Callisthenes, [[Daimachus]], Dinarchus, and Ephorus are believed to have been written between 330 and 310 BC. Except for Dinarchus, almost all of them have been lost to history or survive only in fragments. Among them are Ephorus and Callisthenes who were contemporaries of the Theban hegemony and the Sacred Band.&lt;ref name="shrimpton"/&gt; The works of the latter two, however, survived long enough for later authors like Plutarch, Diodorus, and Polyaenus to base their works on.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buckler"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Buckler  |author2=Hans Beck  |lastauthoramp=yes |title =Central Greece And The Politics Of Power In The Fourth Century BC|publisher =Cambridge University Press|year =2008|isbn =9780521837057|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bn5Nz5yjGUIC&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;ots=bkvxQlA1VU&amp;dq=Phoebidas%20Gorgidas&amp;pg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q=Phoebidas%20Gorgidas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="terry"/&gt;

'''Silahdar Fındıklılı Mehmed Ağa''' (7 December, 1658–1723) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[historian]].

Born in [[Constantinople]] (Istanbul), he entered in the service of the Imperial Ottoman Gardens (''Hasbahçe'') and then as page in the privy chamber. He rose to higher positions in a short time, serving under sultans [[Mehmed IV]], [[Suleiman II]], [[Ahmed II]], [[Mustafa II]] and [[Ahmed III]].

Silahdar Findiklili Mehmed Agha wrote historical chronicles such as "Zeyl-i Fezleke" ("Postscript to the Fezleke," the Fezleke being an earlier work by the historian [[Katib Tchelebi|Kâtip Çelebi]]), which is today commonly known as ''Silahdar Tarihi'' (The History of Sword-Bearer). A second volume of his work was entitled ''Nusretname'' (The Book of Victories). These together recorded the events which occurred prior to and during his lifetime. They present both the events in Constantinople (such as the fire of 1660 which destroyed most of the city) but also his experience during the campaigns of [[Kara Mustafa Pasha]] and the [[battle of Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Silahdar Fındıklılı Mehmet Ağa - ''Silahdar Tarihi'' - Istanbul, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silahdar Fındıklılı Mehmet Ağa, (Sadeleştiren: İsmet Parmaksızoğlu) - ''Nusretnâme'' - Istanbul, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osmanli700.gen.tr/english/individuals/s10.html] Silahdar Findikli Mehmed Aga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guboglu, Mihai; Mehmed, Mustafa A. - ''Cronici Turceşti privind Ţările Române'' - Academia Republicii Socialiste România, Bucureşti, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ground Penetrating Radar in use.jpg|thumb|Ground penetrating radar is a tool used in archaeological field surveys.]]
In [[archaeology]], '''survey''' or '''field survey''' is a type of [[field research]] by which archaeologists (often [[Landscape archaeology|landscape archaeologists]]) search for archaeological sites and collect information about the location, distribution and organization of past human cultures across a large area (e.g. typically in excess of one [[hectare]], and often in excess of many km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Archaeologists conduct surveys to search for particular archaeological sites or kinds of sites, to detect patterns in the distribution of material culture over regions, to make generalizations or test hypotheses about past cultures, and to assess the risks that development projects will have adverse impacts on archaeological heritage.&lt;ref name="Banning 2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Banning |first=E. B.|title=Archaeological Survey |year=2002 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0306473487}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The surveys may be: (a) ''intrusive'' or ''non-intrusive'', depending on the needs of the survey team (and the risk of destroying [[archaeological record|archaeological evidence]] if intrusive methods are used) and; (b) ''extensive'' or ''intensive'', depending on the types of research questions being asked of the [[landscape]] in question. Surveys can be a practical way to decide whether or not to carry out an [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] (as a way of recording the basic details of a possible site), but may also be ends in themselves, as they produce important information about past human activities in a regional context.

A common role of a field survey is in assessment of the potential archaeological significance of places where development is proposed. This is usually connected to construction work and road building.  The assessment determines whether the area of development impact is likely to contain significant archaeological resources and makes recommendations as to whether the archaeological remains can be avoided or an excavation is necessary before development work can commence.

Archaeologists use a variety of tools when carrying out surveys, including [[Geographic information system|GIS]], [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[remote sensing]], [[archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]] and [[aerial photography]].

==Research and planning==
Survey work may be undertaken in response to a specific threat (such as proposed or pending development project) to an area of known or unknown archaeological interest or as part of a program addressing specific research topics. In either case actual fieldwork is most likely to be preceded by a phase of desktop research (reviewing existing data in the form of maps, formal and informal written records, photographs and drawings) or in the modern age internet research using search engines, ancestry and birth or property records online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Standard and guidance for desk-based assessment|year=2012|publisher=Institute of Field Archaeologists|url=http://www.archaeologists.net/sites/default/files/node-files/DBA2012-Working-draft.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consideration should be given to the nature of the landscape (vegetation coverage, existing settlement or industry, soil depth, climate) before a range of techniques is selected to be applied within an appropriate overarching method.

===Rationale===
An area may be considered worthy of surveying based on the following:

*'''Artifacts found''': Locals have picked up physical artifacts, sometimes held by the local museum but more often collected in private homes or old buildings such as churches and synagogues, and it is unclear where they are coming from.
*'''Literary sources''': Old literary sources have provided archaeologists with clues about settlement locations that have not been archaeologically documented. Sometimes the texts may be quite recent; for instance, a book on local history may mention an interesting area.
*'''Oral sources''': In many locations, local stories contain some hint of a greater past, and often they have a basis in history. For instance, someone may remember that a grandfather who used to walk the hills as a shepherd used to talk about columns from an old temple, although the descendant never saw the ruins.
*'''Local knowledge''': In many cases, locals know where to find something of interest to archaeologists. They may not have reported it because of taking it as part of their world, or because of fearing intrusions on their land or community.
*'''Previous surveys''': In some places, a past survey may have been recorded in an academic journal. The use of more recent technologies and finds from other sites may provide reason to re-examine the site.
*'''Previous excavations''': Excavations carried out before the middle of the 20th century are notoriously poorly documented. They were often carried out by methods that left behind much of the evidence the modern-day archaeologist is looking for.  Early excavators were often interested only in fine pottery, jewelry and statues and referred to as rescue archaeologists.
*'''Lack of knowledge''': Many areas of the world have developed limited knowledge about the nature and organization of past human activity at the regional level. (Although one or more sites may be known from an area, often little is known about the wider distribution of contemporary settlements, and how settlement patterns may change over time.) An archaeological field survey is the primary tool for discovering information about previously uninvestigated areas.
*'''Archaeological hypotheses''': Some kinds of archaeological theories — about changes in agricultural strategies or population density for example — are investigated or tested through the use of archaeological surveys of areas that should or should not contain particular kinds of archaeological materials if the theory is true.

===Map regression===
{{main|Map regression}}
Map regression, comparing maps from different periods of the same area, can reveal past structures that were recorded but are no longer visible as surface features. Using modern maps to transcribe or re-project earlier maps can help to locate these features with contemporary survey controls and techniques.

===Aerial photography===
{{main|Aerial archaeology}}
Aerial photography is a good tool for planning a survey. Remains of older buildings often show in fields as cropmarks; just below the topsoil, the remains may affect the growth of crops or grass.&lt;ref name="Whimster 1989"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whimster |first=R. |authorlink= |title=The Emerging Past: Air Photography and the Buried Landscape |year=1989 |publisher=RCHM(E) |location=London |isbn=978-0-9507236-9-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There should preferably be photographs of the same area at different times of the year, allowing the analyst to find the best time to see cropmarks.

===Previous work in the region===
If the indicator that started the process was not a record of previous work, the archaeologists will need to check if any work has been done prior to commencement of the pending project. As many older surveys and excavations were published in papers that are not widely available, this may be a difficult task. A common way to handle this is through a visit to the area, to check with local museums, historians and older people who might remember something about the former activities in a particular locale.

===Permissions===
It is usually a simple matter to gain permission to perform a cultural field survey, especially a non-intrusive one. If the area is privately owned, the local laws may or may not require the landowners' co-operation. Permission for an intrusive form of survey may be more difficult to acquire, due to the fear of destroying evidence or property values and the threat of lawsuit for said damages from the property owner.

==Intrusive vs. non-intrusive surveys==
In a non-intrusive survey, nothing is touched, just recorded. An accurate survey of the earthworks and other features can enable them to be interpreted without the need for [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Christopher|year=1974|title=Fieldwork in Medieval Archaeology|publisher=Batsford|isbn= 978-0-7134-2850-6 |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An intrusive survey can mean different things. In some cases, all artifacts of archaeological value are collected. This is often the case if it is a rescue survey, but less common in a regular survey.

Another form of intrusive research is bore holes. Small holes are drilled into the ground, most often with hand-powered bores. The contents are examined to determine the depths at which one might find cultural layers, and where one might expect to strike virgin soil. This can be valuable in determining the cost of an excavation - if there is a build-up of several meters of soil above the layers the archaeologist is interested in, the price will obviously be much higher than if artifacts are found only centimeters below ground.

==Extensive vs. intensive survey==
One way to classify archaeological field surveys is to divide them into two types: ''intensive'' and ''extensive''. The former is characterised by the complete or near-complete coverage of the survey area at a high resolution, most often by having teams of survey archaeologists walk in a systematic way (e.g. in parallel [[transect]]s) over parcels of the landscape in question, documenting archaeological data such as [[Stone tool|lithics]], [[Pottery|ceramics]] and/or building remains. However, variations in artifact visibility related to topography, vegetation, and soil character, not to mention the imperfect detection abilities of human observers,  bring into question the very concept of complete coverage.&lt;ref name="Banning et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite news |last=Banning |first=E. B. |authorlink= |author2=A. Hawkins |author3=S. T. Stewart |title=Detection functions for archaeological survey|year=2006 |journal=American Antiquity |volume=71 |pages=723–742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banning et al. 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Banning |first=E. B. |authorlink= |author2=A. Hawkins |author3=S. T. Stewart |author4=Steven Edwards |title=Quality Assurance in archaeological survey|year=2016 |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |doi=10.1007/s10816-016-9274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[extensive survey]], on the other hand, is characterised by a low-resolution approach over targets within a study area (sometimes including hundreds of km²). Sometimes this involves a [[random sampling]] or some other kind of probability sample to gain a representative sample of the study area.&lt;ref name="Foley 1981"&gt;{{cite book |last=Foley |first=Robert |authorlink= |title=Off-site archaeology and human adaptation in Eastern Africa |year=1981 |publisher=British Archaeological Reports International series 97 |location=Oxford |pages=8–12|isbn=978-0-86054-114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive surveys may be designed to target the identification of [[archaeological site]]s across a large area, whereas intensive surveys are designed to provide a more comprehensive picture of the location of sites and the nature of off-site data (e.g. [[field systems]], isolated finds, etc.). An intensive survey is the more costly, timely, and ultimately informative of the two approaches, although extensive surveys can provide important information about previously unknown areas.

==Purposive vs. sampling survey==
Archaeological field surveys can also be characterized as either ''purposive'' or ''sampling'' surveys.&lt;ref name="Banning 2002"/&gt;  The former, sometimes also called "[[archaeological prospection]]", involves cases where archaeologists are searching for a particular site or a particular kind of archaeological material. For example, they might be searching for a particular shipwreck or an historic fort whose exact location is no longer certain. However, they may also be searching for archaeological materials in particular locations to test hypotheses about past use of those spaces.
[[Sampling surveys]], on the other hand, have the goal of  obtaining a representative sample of some population of sites or artifacts in order to make generalizations about that population. This involves some probability sampling of spatial units, such as random or stratified [[random sampling]] of geometrical (often square) or irregular spatial units.&lt;ref name="Banning 2002"/&gt;

==Fieldwalking (transects)==
Conventionally, fieldwalking in grids or along lines called [[transects]] has formed the backbone of archaeological survey fieldwork, at least where visibility is fairly good.&lt;ref name="Banning 2002"/&gt; A single researcher or team will walk slowly through the target area looking for artifacts or other archaeological indicators on the surface, often recording aspects of the environment at the time.&lt;ref name="Schofield 1991"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schofield |first=A. J. |authorlink= |title=Interpreting Artefact Scatters: Contributions to Ploughzone Archaeology |year=1991 |publisher=Oxbow |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-946897-25-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method works best on either ploughed ground or surfaces with little vegetation. On ploughed surfaces, as the soil is turned regularly artifacts will move to the top. Erosion and soil loss on uncultivated and lightly vegetated soil (e.g., in semi-arid environments) may cause artifacts to also 'rise' to the surface.

Even with optimal surface conditions the efficacy of fieldwalking varies according to long-term land use, topography, weather conditions, the skill and experience of the fieldwalkers, and other factors. Intensive arable agriculture on hilltops will first expose and then pulverize artifacts such as pottery and even chipped stone (typically flint, chert or obsidian) flakes.&lt;ref name="Tabor 2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tabor |first=Richard |authorlink= |title=Regional Perspectives in Archaeology: From Strategy to Narrative |year=2004 |publisher=British Archaeological Reports International series 1203 |location=Oxford |pages=48–52|isbn=1-84171-350-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabor 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tabor |first=Richard |authorlink= |title=Cadbury Castle: A hillfort and landscapes |year=2008 |publisher=The History Press |location=Stroud |pages=32–33|isbn=978-0-7524-4715-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the plateau and upper scarp or valley side soils will move down slope, forming a deep seal over low-lying archaeological deposits, rendering them inaccessible to surface survey. Even artifacts on the surface and with relatively high visibility (i.e., little obscuring vegetation), however, are not consistently detected by surveyors. Consequently, it is unrealistic to expect 100% recovery of artifacts or even sites. We can evaluate surveyors' effectiveness at detecting artifacts with "Sweep width," which is the theoretical width of a transect in which the number of artifacts detected outside the sweep is identical to the number missed within the sweep.&lt;ref name="Banning 2002"/&gt; The poorer the visibility, the poorer the contrast between the artifact "targets" and their surroundings, or the poorer the surveyor's skill or attention, the narrower the sweep width will be.

Modern technology such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] has made survey recording much easier, as positions of artifacts or artifact clusters ("sites") can be taken well within the limits of accuracy and precision necessary for survey work. Recording the position and attributes of archaeological features has been expedited by customizable portable computing interfaces or mobile Geographical Information Systems ([[Geographical Information Systems|GIS]]).&lt;ref name="mobile GIS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tripcevich|first=Nicholas|title=Flexibility by Design: How mobile GIS meets the needs of archaeological survey|journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science|year=2004|volume=31|issue=3|pages=137–151|url=http://works.bepress.com/tripcevich/3/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Databases containing existing regional archaeological data as well as other landscape GIS layers such as soils, vegetation, modern features, and development plans can be loaded on a mobile GIS for referencing, for sampling purposes, and for groundtruth updating directly in the field, resulting a more informed archaeological survey process.

==Visible above-ground structures and Subsurface Testing==
Fieldwalking involves picking up scattered artefacts in ploughed fields. In heavily wooded areas such as Scandinavia or the North American Northeast, or deeply alluviated areas as in the Netherlands, fieldwalking is not always a practical method. Humus and fallen leaves in forested areas, silt on alluvial fans, or turf in built-up neighbourhoods may render near-surface artifacts and sites invisible even at short distances. In such instances, archaeological surveyors may concentrate on above-ground structures such as burial cairns, collapsed field walls and rock art panels, look for unnatural changes in the vegetation and landscape to decide what may be hidden under the vegetation, or survey by subsurface testing (SST). SSTs can consist of a series of shovel-test pits that penetrate the humus layer or turf or, where substantial later sediments may cover archaeological materials, series of auger or core holes. SSTs are much more costly than fieldwalking, and surveys by SST usually have very low probability of intersecting and detecting archaeological remains unless intensity (density of SSTs), and thus cost, is prohibitively high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Shott |first=Michael|title=Shovel-Test Sampling in Archaeological Survey: Comments on Nance and Ball, and Lightfoot |year=1989 |journal=American Antiquity |volume=54 |pages=396-404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Verhagen |first=Philip |title=Site Discovery and Evaluation Through Minimal Interventions: Core Sampling, Test Pits and Trial Trenches |journal=Good Practices in Archaeological Diagnostics |year=2013 |editor=C. Corsi et al. |pages=209–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various Scandinavian sites and monuments registers mainly list above-ground monuments, not ploughed-out sites with scattered pottery.

===Narrowing it down===
Because of the high costs involved in some kinds of surveys, it is often helpful to use "[[predictive modelling]]" to narrow down the search for archaeological materials. This is particularly important for purposive surveys, but can also be used to guide sampling surveys by eliminating the need to survey areas where, for geological or other reasons, we can reasonably expect all ancient traces to be destroyed (e.g., by erosion) or far too deeply buried (e.g., by alluvium) to be detectable. Modern predictive models in archaeology employ Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

==Geophysical survey==
{{main|Geophysical survey (archaeology)}}
A geophysical survey is used for subsurface mapping of archaeological sites. In recent years, there have been great advances in this field, and it is becoming an increasingly useful and cost-effective tool in archaeology. Geophysical instruments can detect buried archaeological features when their electrical or magnetic properties contrast measurably with their surroundings. In some cases, individual artifacts, especially metal, may be detected as well. Readings taken in a systematic pattern become a dataset that can be rendered as image maps for interpretation. Survey results can be used to guide excavation and to give archaeologists insight into the patterning of non-excavated parts of the site. Unlike other archaeological methods, geophysical survey is not invasive or destructive. For this reason, it is often used where preservation (rather than excavation) is the goal for project preservation and compliance with applicable laws.

The geophysical methods most commonly applied to archaeology are [[magnetometer]]s, [[electrical resistance]] meters, [[ground-penetrating radar]] (GPR) and electromagnetic (EM) conductivity. These methods provide excellent resolution of many types of archaeological features, and are capable of high sample density surveys of very large areas and of operating under a wide range of conditions. While common [[metal detector]]s are geophysical sensors, they are not capable of generating high-resolution imagery. Other established and emerging technologies are also finding use in archaeological applications.

Although geophysical surveying has been used in the past with intermittent success, good results are very likely when it is applied appropriately. It is most useful when it is used in a well-integrated research design where interpretations can be tested and refined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tabor |first=Richard |authorlink= |title=Regional Perspectives in Archaeology: From Strategy to Narrative |year=2004 |publisher=British Archaeological Reports International series 1203 |location=Oxford |pages=41–46|isbn=1-84171-350-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretation requires a knowledge both of the [[archaeological record]], and of the way it is expressed geophysically. Appropriate instrumentation, field survey design, and data processing are essential for success, and must be adapted to the unique geology and archaeological record of each site. In the field, control of data quality and spatial accuracy are critical to a successful mission completion.

==Analysis and evaluation==
The most important parts of the survey are analysis and evaluation. The types of questions that archaeologist often ask of survey data include: what is the evidence for first occupation of an area; when was this area occupied; how are sites distributed; where are sites located; what evidence is there for a settlement hierarchy; what sites are contemporary with each other; how has the modern landscape interfered with the visibility of archaeological remains; what sorts of activities can be recognized (e.g. dwellings, tombs, field systems); how many people lived in this area at any given time or how did population density change over time; why did people choose to live where they did; how has the landscape changed over time; what changes in settlement patterns have there been? However, answering such questions depends on the quality of the evidence, which is why it is important to evaluate the effectiveness and thoroughness of the survey or surveys that contribute that evidence.&lt;ref name="Banning et al. 2016"/&gt;

At times, one part of the survey may not have yielded the evidence one wanted to find. For instance, very little may have been found during a field walk, but there are strong indications from geophysical survey and local stories that there is a building underneath a field. In such a case, the only way to decide if an excavation is worth the cost is to carefully analyze the evidence to determine which part to trust. On the one hand, the geophysics might just show an old and forgotten water-pipe, but it might also show the wall of just the building the archaeologists were looking for.

The analysis therefore includes careful examination of all the evidence collected. A method often used to determine its value is to compare it to sites of the same period. As the number of well-documented surveys grow, this becomes a slightly easier task, as it is sometimes easier to compare two survey results than to compare a survey result with an excavated site.

'''Tedbury''' (c. 1780, Botany Bay – 1810, Parramatta), also known as ''Tidbury'' and ''Tjedboro'', was a [[Darug]] [[Aboriginal Australian]] involved in frequent acts of resistance to British colonists in the early years of [[New South Wales]].  He was the son of noted warrior and resistance fighter [[Pemulwuy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/tedbury-13311|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Kohen|first=J. L.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tedbury was captured in 1805 and tried before the magistrate at Parramatta, [[Reverend Marsden|Reverend Samuel Marsden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/aborig_history/transgressions/mobile_devices/ch07.html |title='Hanging no good for blackfellow': looking into the life of Musquito |last=Parry |first=Naomi |publisher=Australian National University |editor=Ingereth Macfarlane, Mark Hannah |date=2007 |isbn=9781921313431 |access-date=9 February 2017}}, Transgressions, Critical Australian Indigenous Histories&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626769 |title=Sydney |newspaper=[[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales |date=19 May 1805 |accessdate=25 February 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released at the behest of Aboriginal Australians who had participated in the capture of [[Musquito]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626869 |title=Sydney |newspaper=[[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales |date=4 August 1805 |accessdate=25 February 2014 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tedbury was an ally of [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]] and a frequent visitor to [[Elizabeth Farm]]. When [[Governor Bligh]] placed Macarthur under arrest in 1808, Tedbury offered to spear the governor.

He also took part in a robbery of a traveller named Tunks on Parramatta Road in 1809. The local newspaper reported at the time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The son appears to have inherited the ferocity and vices of his father : Upon the above occasion he pointed his spear to the head and breast of Tunks, and repeatedly threatened to plunge the weapon into him ; but other persons fortunately appearing in sight, the assailants betook to the woods. Several  other such attacks have been made, but as Tedbury is stated to have always been of the party, which consisted; but of two or three, it may be inferred that a spirit of malevolence is far from general; and under this belief, it may be hoped the settlers   will not permit their servants or families to practice unnecessary severities which may irritate, and provoke those who are at present peaceably disposed, to join in the atrocities of a few miscreants, whom their own tribes, if not exasperated by ill treatment, would no doubt as they have frequently done before, betray into our hands, and avowedly assist in apprehending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article627808 |title=Sydney |newspaper=[[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales |date=3 September 1809 |accessdate=25 February 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Bond Farm Attack==
{{Campaignbox Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars}}

Tedbury also took part an attack on a settlers farm owned by Thomas Bond at Georges River on 26 September 1809. According to a contemporary report:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of natives assembled about the farm... and behaved in a very outrageous manner. They manifested an inclination to plunder, but were prevented by the determination that was shewn to resist them. They threw several spears, one of which grazed the ear of Mr. F. Meredith, who assisted in the defence of the place, which it was at length found necessary to abandon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article627831 |title=Sydney |newspaper=[[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales |date=1 October 1809 |accessdate=25 February 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Tedbury was then involved in a theft of a flock of sheep belonging to Edward Powell of Parramatta Road, Canterbury. Powell and some men tried to track down the thieves but they escaped, although some of the sheep were recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article627838 |title=Sydney |newspaper=[[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |location=New South Wales |date=15 October 1809 |accessdate=25 February 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violent death==
On 19 February 1810, Tedbury, in full view of witnesses, threw a spear at the sister of Edward Luttrell, in the garden of her house at Paramatta.  Edward shot him in the upper lip and notwithstanding treatment the next day from the Assistant Surgeon at Hawkesbury, after at least some weeks&lt;ref name="NSWKR1"&gt;{{cite web|title=R. v.

'''''The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492 ''''' is a 1972 book on the [[Columbian exchange]] by [[Alfred W. Crosby]].

==Reception==
Various academic authorities have reviewed the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liers|first1=Frederick H.|last2=Crosby|first2=Alfred W.|title=The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|date=1 December 2005|volume=36|issue=4|pages=1210|doi=10.2307/20477666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunbar|first1=G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6577">'''Thomas Lydiat''' (1572 &amp;ndash; 3 April, 1646) was a clergyman and mathematician in [[England]]. In his time he was noted as a [[chronologer]] and was an opponent in controversy of [[Scaliger]]. He is now considered, albeit in a very different type of theory, to have provided in 1605 a clear suggestion of an oval orbit in astronomy, anticipating [[Johannes Kepler]], with whom he also had a controversial exchange relating to chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 1973JHA.....4..192D | title=A Hitherto Unreported Pre-Keplerian Oval Orbit | journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy | volume=4 | page=192 | year=1973 | authors=Donahue, W. H. | doi=10.1177/002182867300400306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/sj/scientists/guldin.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporaries ranked him with [[Joseph Mede]] and [[Francis Bacon]]. His ultimate poverty, certainly exaggerated, furnished [[Samuel Johnson]] with an allusion in his poem on the ''Vanity of Human Wishes''.&lt;ref name = DNB&gt;[[:s:Lydiat, Thomas (DNB00)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
The son of Christopher Lydiat, he was born in 1572 at [[Alkerton, Oxfordshire]], of which [[Benefice#Church of England|living]] his father was patron. In 1584, at eleven years of age, he gained a scholarship at [[Winchester College]], and passing thence to [[New College, Oxford]], was elected probationer fellow in 1591, and full fellow two years later. He graduated B.A. 3 May 1595, and M.A. 5 February 1599.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

Defective memory and speech led him to give up both the study of divinity and his fellowship in 1603, in order to devote himself to mathematics and chronology. In 1609 he dedicated his ''Emendatio Temporum'' to [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], who appointed him his chronographer and cosmographer, and took him into his household as reader, granting him an annual pension and the use of his library. During the course of this year he became acquainted with [[James Ussher]].&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

He spent about two years in [[Dublin]], became fellow of [[Trinity College, Dublin]] 7 March 1610, and graduated M.A. there in the summer of the same year. Ussher found him rooms in the college and an appointment as reader, with a salary. The mastership of [[The Royal School, Armagh]], seems also to have been promised him. Before August 1611 he had returned to London, but he still wrote to Ussher pressing his claim to the mastership.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

The death of the Prince of Wales in 1612 cut off his hopes of preferment, and in the same year, after some hesitation, he accepted the family living of Alkerton, which he had refused during his father's lifetime. The following years he devoted to the study of chronology, and carried on a controversy with Scaliger; Lydiat's chronological discoveries are described in [[Robert Plot]]'s ''Oxfordshire''.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt; He constructed a new Rectory, in Alkerton, in 1625. It is considered to be one of the finest small Rectories in the country.

In 1629 or 1630 he became surety for the debts of his brother, and being unable to pay was committed to prison, first in the [[Bocardo Prison]] at Oxford, and subsequently in the King's Bench, where he pursued his studies, spending what money he could upon books. The efforts of [[Sir William Boswell]], Dr. [[Robert Pink]] (Warden of New College), Ussher (who is said to have paid £300 for him), and [[William Laud]], ultimately led to his release. At this point he vainly petitioned the king for permission to travel in Turkey, Armenia, and Abyssinia, in order to collect materials for civil and ecclesiastical history.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

Later, Lydiat's staunch royalism and uncompromising expression of his opinions brought him under the notice of the parliamentarians. His rectory was pillaged more than once, and he was carried off to prison, once to [[Warwick]], and again to [[Banbury]]. He died at Alkerton, 3 April 1646, and was buried the next day in the chancel of his church. In 1669 a stone was laid over his grave by the society of New College, who also erected a monument, with an inscription to his memory on a black marble table, at the north end of the east cloister of the college.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

==Works==

Lydiat's published works were:

*''Tractatus de variis Annorum formis'', Lond. 1605.
*''Praelectio Astronomica de Natura Coeli et conditionibus Elementorum.'' ''Disquisitio Physiologica de origine fontium' (these two printed with the first). 
*''Defensio Tractatus de variis Annorum formis contra J. Scaligeri observationes'', Lond. 1607, dedicated to Sir [[Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet|Anthony Cope]] of Hanwell. 
*''Examen Canonum Chronologiae Isagogieorum'' (printed with the 'Defensio'). 
*''Emendatio Temporum ab initio Mundi . . . contra Scaligerum et alios'', Lond. 1609.
*''Recensio et Explicatio argumentorum — insertia brevibus confutationibus opinionum I. Scaligeranae, Baronianae. . . atque Johannis Keppleri,' 1613. 
*''Solis et Lunae Periodus seu Annus Magnus'', Lond. 1620. 
*''De Anni Solaris Mensura Epistola astronomica ad Hen. Savilium,'' Lond. 1620.
*''Numerus Aureus mellioribus Lapillis insignatus, &amp;c.'', Lond. 1621. 
*''Canones Chronologici'', Oxford, 1675. Published from a manuscript in the library of [[John Lamphire]]. 
*''Letters to Dr. Jam. Ussher, Primate of Ireland.'' Printed at the end of Ussher's Life,' 1686, published by [[Richard Parr (biographer)|Richard Parr]].
*''Marmoreum Chronicon Arundelianum cum Annotationibus'', of which manuscripts are in the Bodleian and Trinity College, Dublin; printed in [[Humphrey Prideaux]]'s ''Marmora Oxoniensis.''&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

Soon after Lydiat's death [[John Worthington (academic)|John Worthington]] and others made efforts to collect Lydiat's manuscripts with a view to having them printed. According to the Preface to Lydiat's ''Canones Chronologici'', his manuscripts were carried off by a countryman to his cottage, where John Lamphire accidentally discovered them some years after Lydiat's death; others were presented to him by Robert Plot. These then passed, apparently, with the rest of Lamphire's property, into the hands of [[William Coward]] M,D., who presented to the [[Bodleian Library]] fifteen manuscripts.&lt;ref name = DNB/&gt;

'''Terminal 3''', also known by the trademarked name '''Worldport''', was an [[airport terminal]] built by [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am) in 1960 at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]. It opened on May 24, 1960 and ceased operations on May 24, 2013; it was demolished in late 2013.

==History==
===Original use===
[[Image:Pan Am Worldport overview.jpg|thumb|left|The distinctive "flying saucer" roof design of the Worldport]]
The terminal was originally known as the "Pan Am Terminal" or Pan Am "Unit Terminal Building (UTB)." It was designed by Ives, Turano &amp; Gardner Associated Architects and Walther Prokosch of Tippets-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton as a showcase for international jet travel and is particularly famous for its {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} "flying saucer" roof suspended far from the outside columns of the terminal by 32 sets of pre-stressed steel posts and cables. The terminal was designed to allow for aircraft to be parked under the partial overhang; marketing brochures promoted it as the jet-age terminal that brought the plane to the passenger. The overhang sheltered passengers as they boarded the aircraft by stairs or by uncovered bridges. The [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) ''Guide to New York City'' called the terminal a "genuine architectural attempt to answer the problem of all-weather connections to the planes" but derided the overall concept as "compromised by an overabundance of distracting detail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=AIA Guide to New York City |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0gj61QSgk8C&amp;pg=PA811&amp;lpg=PA811 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |author=White, Norval |author2=Willensky, Elliot |author3=Leadon, Fran |page=811 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's facade originally featured [[zodiac]] figures made by sculptor [[Milton Hebald]],&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Sanka. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0812F73E5916738DDDAA0894DE405B808AF1D3 "IDLEWILD SKYLINE GETS AN ADDITION; New Pan Am Terminal Looks Like Parasol to Motorists Approaching Airport"], [[New York Times]], June 3, 1960. Accessed October 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; although these were later removed by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68708702.html "Outrage.(Pan American airport terminal in disrepair)"], ''[[Architectural Review]]'', December 2000. Accessed October 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The terminal featured the Panorama Room, a dining room with a view of the entire concourse, and the Clipper Hall museum of Pan Am history.

In 1971, the terminal was expanded to accommodate the large [[Boeing 747]] and renamed the "Pan Am Worldport". The Worldport was the world's largest airline terminal and held the title for several years.

|image2=JFK Terminal 3 2012.jpg|caption2=In 2012}}

Operation of the Worldport changed hands when Pan Am declared bankruptcy in 1991. [[Delta Air Lines]] acquired many of Pan Am's assets, including the lease on the Worldport, which became known simply as "Terminal 3", and operated most of its long-haul flights out of JFK to Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America from the building.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In March 2006, Delta COO Jim Whitehurst announced that Delta would spend US$10 million before the end of that year to renovate Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, including its public spaces, BusinessElite lounge, and Crown Room Clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Delta Air Lines To Surpass American In JFK Departures |first=Jay |last=Boehmer |url=http://www.businesstravelnews.com/More-News/Articles/Delta-Air-Lines-To-Surpass-American-In-JFK-Departures/ |work=Business Travel News |date=March 20, 2006 |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the July 2007 issue of Delta's ''Sky Magazine'', Delta Senior Vice President Joanne Smith remarked on the "distinctive" saucer roof in an article on new flooring, lighting, and signage at this "historic airport".

On August 4, 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Delta was planning to move its international flights to Terminal 4 following the construction of nine additional gates in Concourse B of that terminal. Delta's domestic flights would continue to be operated out of Terminal 2. Terminal 3 would subsequently be demolished to create additional [[hardstand|aircraft parking]] between Terminals 2 and 4. Construction of the Terminal 4 expansion began in November 2010 and was completed in May 2013.

On May 23, 2013, the final departure from Terminal 3, [[Delta Air Lines]] Flight 268, a [[Boeing 747-400]] to [[Tel Aviv]] [[Ben Gurion Airport]], departed from Gate 6 at 11:25pm local time. The terminal ceased operations on the next day, 53 years to the day from when it opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Frischling |first=Steven |title=Photographer |url=http://boardingarea.com/blogs/flyingwithfish/2013/05/17/a-historic-chapter-in-aviation-closes-it-wont-be-documented/ |accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historic Preservation|Preservation]] groups campaigned to save the building and have it nominated by the New York [[State Historic Preservation Office]] as a [[National Register of Historic Places|historic place]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Save The Pan Am Worldport |url=http://www.facebook.com/PanAmWorldport |accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 19, 2013, the Worldport was placed on the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]'s [[America's Most Endangered Places|list of 11 Most Endangered Places in America]] for 2013,&lt;ref name="historic sites lost" /&gt; but by June 25, 2013, demolition of the elevated roadway leading to the terminal had already begun, although preservationists continued to protest against the demolition of the building itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Preservationists fight to save Pan Am terminal 'Worldport' at JFK airport |author=Clare Trapasso |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/preservationists-cry-save-worldport-article-1.1382281 |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York State Historic Preservation Office, which had revoked the building's eligibility for the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001,&lt;ref name="2012 FOIL Request"&gt;{{cite web |last=Worldport |first=Save the |title=2012 SHPO FOIL |url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.491185194238416.114871.131386373551635&amp;type=3 |work=Remembering the Pan Am Worldport |accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; upheld this decision in May 2013, claiming the building had lost significant historic integrity due to excessive modifications.

The preservation campaign was ultimately unsuccessful and demolition of the flying saucer section was completed on November 22, 2013. Demolition work on the remainder of the terminal completed in summer 2014. The National Trust for Historic Preservation cited the Worldport as one of ten historic sites lost in 2013.&lt;ref name="historic sites lost"&gt;{{cite news |last=staff |title=A look at 10 historic sites save, 10 lost in 2013 |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] as reported by the [[Post Crescent]] |date=January 5, 2014 |page=F3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was subsequently large media outcry, particularly in other countries, concerning the demolition of the Worldport. Several online petitions requesting the restoration of the original 'flying saucer' have gained popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Port Authority Approves Construction |url=http://www.panynj.gov/press-room/press-item.cfm?headLine_id=1309 |publisher=[[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Plans For Expanding Terminal 4 at JFK Airport |url=http://home2.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fhome2.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2010b%2Fpr348-10.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 |publisher=NYC Office of the Mayor |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Plans for Enhancement and Expansion of Terminal 4 at JFK Airport |url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=1095 |publisher=[[Delta Air Lines]] |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Details Of JFK Improvements&amp;nbsp;– Civil Aviation Forum |url=http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/4895622/ |publisher=Airliners.net |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
