'''Abu Amr Abbad II al-Mu'tadid ''' (died February 28, 1069), a member of the [[Abbadid dynasty]], was  the second independent Muslim king of [[Seville]] (reigned 1042–1069)  in [[Al-Andalus]]. His father, [[Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad]], had established the [[taifa of Seville]], and Abbad became its king when Abu al-Qasim died in 1042. He initially had amicable relations with his neighbour [[Ferdinand I of León and Castile|Ferdinand I]], Count of Castile and King of León, and tolerated the Christian faith in his own lands. Among other acts of friendship, he authorized the transfer of [[Saint Isidore]]'s relics from Seville to the [[Basilica of San Isidoro]] of [[León, Spain|León]].

Al-Mu'tadid expanded his territory by conquering numerous Islamic [[taifa]]s (independent principalities), including those of [[taifa of Mértola|Mértola]] (1044-45), [[taifa of Huelva|Huelva]] (1051),  [[taifa of Algeciras|Algeciras]] (1055), [[taifa of Ronda|Ronda]] (1065) and [[taifa of Arcos de la Frontera|Arcos]] (1069). In 1053, he invited a number of minor Berber princes from the south to his palace in Seville, suffocating them to death by treating them to an open steam bath, having first sealed up all of the openings in the bathhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/243807376|title=Dictators and tyrants : absolute rulers and would-be rulers in world history|last=Alan.|first=Axelrod,|date=1995|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=0816028664|oclc=243807376}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also fought against the [[Zirids]] of [[Kingdom of Granada|Granada]] and the Aftasids of [[taifa of Badajoz|Badajoz]], but with no conclusive results. In 1063, when Ferdinand I appeared with an army on the outskirts of Seville, Abbad was forced to acknowledge his suzerainty and to pay him tribute. 

Abbad II al-Mu'tadid died in 1069 and was succeeded by his son, [[al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad]].

'''[[Abuse]] of [[Power (social and political)|power]]''', in the form of "[[malfeasance in office]]" or "official misconduct," is the commission of an [[Crime|unlawful]] act, done in an official capacity, which affects the performance of official duties. Malfeasance in office is often grounds for a [[for cause]] removal of an elected official by [[statute]] or [[recall election]]. Abuse of power can also mean a person using the power they have for their own personal gain.

==Institutional abuse==
[[Institutional abuse]] is the maltreatment of a person (often children or older adults) by a system of power.&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powers|first=J. L.|author2=A. Mooney &amp; M. Nunno|title=Institutional abuse: A review of the literature|journal=Journal of Child and Youth Care|year=1990|volume=4|issue=6|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can range from acts similar to home-based [[child abuse]], such as [[neglect]], [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse|sexual]] abuse, to the effects of assistance programs working below acceptable service standards, or relying on harsh or unfair ways to modify behavior.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt;

==Examples==
{{Incomplete section|date=January 2018}}
===Joe Arpaio===
{{Main|Joe Arpaio}}
In February 2010, Judge John Leonardo found that Arpaio "misused the power of his office to target members of the Board of Supervisors for criminal investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wingett |first=Yvonne |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/02/25/20100225wilcox0225.html#ixzz0y8iImUJ8 |title=Supervisor cases collapse |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2010-02-25 |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a federal grand jury began an inquiry of Arpaio for abuse of power, in connection with an FBI investigation.&lt;ref name=KPHO&gt;{{cite news|title=Sources: FBI Investigating Joe Arpaio |url=http://www.kpho.com/news/21470567/detail.html |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |newspaper=KPHO |date=Oct 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020184811/http://www.kpho.com/news/21470567/detail.html |archivedate=October 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |last=Conder |first=Chuck |title=Arizona sheriff under investigation for alleged abuse of power |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/09/arizona.tough.sheriff/index.html?video=true&amp;hpt=T2 |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |newspaper=CNN |date=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2012, the Arizona US Attorney's office announced that it was "closing its investigation into allegations of criminal conduct" by Arpaio, without filing charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/08/31/feds-close-criminal-investigation-into-maricopa-county-sheriff-joe-arpaio/ |title=Feds close criminal investigation into Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio |publisher=Fox News |date=August 31, 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arpaio was investigated for politically motivated and "bogus" prosecutions, which a former US Attorney called "utterly unacceptable".&lt;ref name="KPHO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; Phoenix Mayor [[Phil Gordon (politician)|Phil Gordon]] has called Arpaio's "long list" of questionable prosecutions "a reign of terror".&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

===Fa Zheng===
{{Main|Fa Zheng}}
Fa Zheng, a Chinese man, was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Shu [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] (蜀郡) and "General Who Spreads Martial Might" (揚武將軍) by Liu Bei. He oversaw administrative affairs in the vicinity of Yi Province's capital [[Chengdu]] and served as Liu Bei's chief adviser.&lt;ref&gt;(以正為蜀郡太守、揚武將軍，外統都畿，內為謀主。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period of time, he abused his power by taking personal revenge against those who offended him before and killing them without reason. Some officials approached [[Zhuge Liang]], another of Liu Bei's key advisers, and urged him to report Fa Zheng's lawless behaviour to their lord and take action against him. However, Zhuge Liang replied, "When our lord was in Gong'an (公安), he was wary of [[Cao Cao]]'s influence in the north and fearful of [[Sun Quan]]'s presence in the east. Even in home territory he was afraid that [[Lady Sun]] might stir up trouble. He was in such a difficult situation at the time that he could neither advance nor retreat. Fa Xiaozhi supported and helped him so much, such that he is now able to fly high and no longer remain under others' influence. How can we stop Fa Zheng from behaving as he wishes?" Zhuge Liang was aware that Liu Bei favoured and trusted Fa Zheng, which was why he refused to intervene in this matter.&lt;ref&gt;(一飡之德，睚眦之怨，無不報復，擅殺毀傷己者數人。或謂諸葛亮曰：「法正於蜀郡太縱橫，將軍宜啟主公，抑其威福。」亮荅曰：「主公之在公安也，北畏曹公之彊，東憚孫權之逼，近則懼孫夫人生變於肘腋之下；當斯之時，進退狼跋，法孝直為之輔翼，令翻然翱翔，不可復制，如何禁止法正使不得行其意邪！」初，孫權以妹妻先主，妹才捷剛猛，有諸兄之風，侍婢百餘人，皆親執刀侍立，先主每入，衷心常凜凜；亮又知先主雅愛信正，故言如此。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police officers===

In dictatorial, corrupt, or weak states, police officers may carry out many criminal acts for the ruling regime with impunity.

'''Alfonso I''' of Asturias, called '''the Catholic''' (''el Católico''), (c. 693 – 757) was the third [[King of Asturias]], reigning from 739 to his death in 757.  His reign saw an extension of the Christian domain of Asturias, reconquering [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] and [[León, Spain|León]].

He succeeded his brother-in-law [[Favila of Asturias|Favila]], and was succeeded by his son, [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela I]]. Alfonso's youngest son, [[Mauregatus]], also became king, and his daughter [[Adosinda]] was consort to king [[Silo of Asturias]]. The dynasty started by Alfonso was known in contemporary [[Al-Andalus]] as the ''[[Astur-Leonese dynasty]]''.

==Biography==

As the son of Duke [[Peter of Cantabria]], Alfonso held many lands in that region. He is said to have married [[Ermesinda]], daughter of [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]], who founded Asturias after the [[Battle of Covadonga]] in which he reversed the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Moorish conquest]] of the region. He succeeded Pelagius' son, his brother-in-law, [[Favila of Asturias|Favila]], on the throne after the latter's premature death.

[[File:Afonso I das Astúrias.png|thumb|left|250px|Alfonso I of Asturias, in a miniature from ''The Portuguese Genealogy (Genealogia dos Reis de Portugal)'' (1530-1534).]]
Whether Pelagius or Favila were ever considered kings in their own lifetime is debatable, but Alfonso certainly was. He began a lifelong war against the Moors. In 740, he conquered [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and in 754, [[Kingdom of León|León]]. He went as far as [[La Rioja (autonomous community)|La Rioja]]. However, the few urban populations of these frontier regions fled to his northern dominions, leaving a depopulated buffer between the [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] states.

This created the so-called ''[[Desert of the Duero]]'', an empty region between the River [[Duero]] and the Asturian Mountains. Alfonso intended it this way; he wished to leave such a zone where any invading army would find it too difficult to survive. Besides the martial, the demographic and cultural effects of this policy on later Asturian, Spanish and Portuguese history is large. It was over a hundred years before the region was repopulated (an event known as the ''[[Repoblación]]'').

The [[Arab]] writers speak of the kings of the northwest of Iberia as the ''Beni Alfons'' (descendants or House of Alfonso), and appear to recognize them as a Galician royal stock derived from Alfonso I. Alfonso is credited with establishing the shrine of [[Our Lady of Covadonga]], in commemoration of his father in law's victory at the [[Battle of Covadonga]]. He and his queen are interred there. Their epitaph reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Francisco Valle Poo | publisher = Ediciones Nobel S.A.| title = El solar de un Viejo Reino (Cangas de Onís-Covadonga-Picos de Europa)| year = 2000|isbn = 84-8459-004-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: "AQVI YAZE EL CATOLICO Y SANTO REI DON ALONSO EL PRIMERO I SV MVJER DOÑA ERMENISINDA ERMANA DE DON FAVILA A QVIEN SVCEDIO. GANO ESTE REY MVCHAS VITORIAS À LOS MOROS. FALLECIO EN CANGAS AÑO DE 757."

: "''Here lies the Catholic and Holy King Don Alfonso the First and his wife Doña Ermesinda, sister of Don Favila to whom he succeeded. This king won many victories against the Moors. He died in Cangas in the year 757.''"

==Issue==
Alfonso had four children. Three were through his marriage to Ermesinda, although Mauregatus was born to a Muslim slave, Sisalda.

*[[Fruela I of Asturias]] (722-768): succeeded Alfonso as king (757-768).
*[[Vimorano]]: assassinated in 765 by Fruela.
*[[Adosinda]]: Queen consort of King [[Silo of Asturias]] (reigned 774-783)
*[[Mauregatus of Asturias]]: Succeeded Silo as king (reigned 783-789).

The quotation "'''All men are created equal'''" has been called an "immortal declaration," and "perhaps [the] single phrase" of the [[American Revolution]]ary period with the greatest "continuing importance."&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Jack P. Greene, ''All Men Are Created Equal: Some Reflections on the Character of the American Revolution'' (1000. p. 5: "Perhaps no single phrase from the Revolutionary era has had such continuing importance in American public life as the dictum 'all men are created equal'".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Wynne Jeudwine, ''Pious Phrases in Politics: An Examination of Some Popular Catchwords, their Misuse and Meanings'' (1919), p. 27, quoting Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] of [[Illinois]], author of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], as referencing the "immortal declaration that all men are created equal".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] first used the phrase in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence]], which he penned in 1776 during the beginning of the American Revolution. It was thereafter quoted and incorporated into speeches by a wide array of substantial figures in American political and social life in the United States. The final form of the phrase was stylized by [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Merrill. ''Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation: A biography''. p. 90. Oxford University Press, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of Thomas Jefferson's use of the phrase==
Thomas Jefferson, through his friendship with Lafayette, was heavily influenced by French philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Montesquieu. In their often censored writings, those philosophers advocated that men were born free and equal. This later led to the French Revolution of 1789 and the concept of Human Rights (Droits de l'Homme in French).  At the age of 33, Jefferson may have also borrowed the expression from an Italian friend and neighbor, [[Philip Mazzei]],&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mazzei, [[The Virginia Gazette]], 1774. Translated by a friend and neighbor, Thomas Jefferson:&lt;br&gt;
{{quote|''Tutti gli uomini sono per natura egualmente liberi e indipendenti. Quest'eguaglianza è necessaria per costituire un governo libero. Bisogna che ognuno sia uguale all'altro nel diritto naturale.''}} 
Translated by Jefferson as follow: 
{{quote|All men are by nature equally free and independent. Such equality is necessary in order to create a free government.
All men must be equal to each other in natural law}}

He may also have influenced [[Thomas Paine]]'s [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']].

{{quote|All men are by nature equally free and independent. Such equality is necessary in order to create a free government.&lt;br /&gt;All men must be equal to each other in natural law}}&lt;/ref&gt; as noted by Joint Resolution 175 of the [[103rd United States Congress|103rd Congress]] as well as by [[John F. Kennedy]] in ''[[A Nation of Immigrants]]''.{{refn|According to Joint Resolution 175 of the 103rd Congress, "the phrase in the Declaration of Independence 'All men are created equal' was suggested by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[patriotism|patriot]] and [[immigrant]] Philip Mazzei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hjres175eh/pdf/BILLS-103hjres175eh.pdf|title=103D CONGRESS : 2D SESSION : H. J. RES. 175|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;"The great doctrine 'All men are created equal' incorporated into the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson, was paraphrased from the writing of Philip Mazzei, an Italian-born patriot and pamphleteer, who was a close friend of Jefferson." by John F. Kennedy, ''A Nation of Immigrants'' pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776 the [[Second Continental Congress]] asked Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, [[John Adams]], [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]], and [[Roger Sherman]] to write the Declaration of Independence.  This [[Committee of Five]] voted to have Thomas Jefferson write the document.  After Jefferson finished he gave the document to Franklin to proof. Franklin suggested minor changes, one of which stands out far more than the others:  "We hold these truths to be sacred and un-deniable..." became "We hold these truths to be self-evident."

The second paragraph of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] starts as follows: 
{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness|Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness]].-- That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], chiefly authored by [[George Mason]] and approved by the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention]] on June 12, 1776, contains the wording:
{{quote|all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights of which . . . they cannot deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

George Mason was an elder-planter who had originally stated [[John Locke]]'s theory of natural rights:
{{quote|All men are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent natural rights of which they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.&lt;ref&gt;Blumrosen, Alfred W. and Ruth G., Slave Nation: How Slavery United the Colonies and Sparked the American Revolution, Sourcebooks, 2005, pp. 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mason's draft was accepted by a small committee and then rejected by the Virginia Convention.  Thomas Jefferson, a competent Virginia lawyer, saw this as a problem in legal writing and chose words that were more acceptable to the Second Continental Congress.

The [[Massachusetts Constitution]], chiefly authored by [[John Adams]] in 1780, contains in its  [[Massachusetts Constitution#Part the First: A Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts|Declaration of Rights]] the wording:

{{quote|Article I. All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1780)#Article I|Article I, Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1780)]]&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
 
The plaintiffs in the cases of ''[[Mum Bett|Brom and Bett v. John Ashley]]'' and ''[[Commonwealth v. Nathaniel Jennison]]'' argued that this provision abolished slavery in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPvq0-taGAEC |pages=74–75 |title=Founding the Republic |author=John J. Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter case resulted in a "sweeping declaration . . . that the institution of slavery was incompatible with the principles of liberty and legal equality articulated in the new Massachusetts Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/courts/sjc/constitution-slavery-e.html The Massachusetts Constitution, Judicial Review and Slavery – The Quock Walker Case], Massachusetts Judicial Branch (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has since been considered a hallmark statement in democratic constitutions and similar human rights instruments, many of which have adopted the phrase or variants thereof.{{refn|UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Preamble: Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity, and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world &amp; Article 1: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Slavery and the phrase==
The contradiction between the claim that "all men are created equal" and the existence of American slavery attracted comment when the Declaration of Independence was first published. Before final approval, Congress, having made a few alterations to some of the wording, also deleted nearly a fourth of the draft, including a passage criticizing the slave trade.  At that time many members of Congress, including Jefferson, owned slaves, which clearly factored into their decision to delete the controversial "anti-slavery" passage. Jefferson, an abolitionist at heart, believed adding such a passage would dissolve the independence movement. Jefferson decades before the declaration of independence, argued in court for abolition of a slave. The court dismissed the case outright. In writing the declaration, Jefferson believed the phrase "all men are created equal" to be self evident, and would ultimately resolve slavery.  &lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Armitage, David. The Declaration Of Independence: A Global History. 76–77. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02282-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, [[abolitionist]] [[Thomas Day]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over  his affrighted slaves.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
The phrase "all men are created equal" has received criticism from [[Elitism|elitists]] and [[Traditional conservatism|traditional conservatives]]. For instance, [[Richard M. Weaver]] writing in one of the cornerstone works of traditional conservatism, ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' (1948), paraphrased a 19th-century writer in writing that "no man was ever created free and no two men [were] ever created equal". He continues:
{{quote|The comity of peoples in groups large or small rests not upon this chemerical notion of equality but upon [[fraternity]], a concept which long antedates it in history because it goes immeasurably deeper in human sentiment. The ancient feeling of brotherhood carries obligations of which equality knows nothing. It calls for respect and protection, for brotherhood is status in family, and family is by nature hierarchical.&lt;ref name=WEA&gt;Weaver, Richard. Ideas Have Consequences. 41-42. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-226-87678-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
The [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Vietnamese proclamation of independence]], written in 1945, uses the phrase "all men are created equal" and mentions the [[United States Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence]] in it as well.

The [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Rhodesian declaration of independence]], ratified in November 1965, is based on the American one, however, it omits the phrase "all men are created equal", along with "[[Consent of the governed|the consent of the governed]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Bridgeflyer.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Allan Bridge's flyer which he posted around Manhattan in 1980.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mrapology2.jpg|right|thumb|250px]] --&gt;
'''Allan Bridge''' (February 14, 1945 - August 5, 1995) was an American conceptual artist best known for his creation in 1980 of the confessional phone system known as the Apology Line. He went by the pseudonym '''Mr. Apology''' (a label which has since been adopted by an advice columnist) and used new technology of the time, an answering machine, to record confessions from anonymous callers.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Falls Church, Virginia]], Bridge attended the University of Chicago, where he earned a bachelor's degree in fine arts. Returning to the [[Washington, D. C.]] area, he became one of the second generation of artists of the Washington Color School movement.

For a series of large-scale paintings, he used poured paint techniques and then moved on to geometric abstraction. He was championed and collected by Gene Baro, at one time the director of the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]]. Bridge exhibited at the Corcoran and many other galleries in the 1970s. He created at least 79 paintings in the years spanning 1970 to 1977. Bridge married Elinor Schiele in 1977, and they divorced in 1981.

Eventually, Bridge tired of the visual image and began making interactive machines with moral implications. The most famous best known of these is ''Crime Time'', where the viewer spins a wheel of chance and either gets away with a "crime" by receiving a marble from the machine, or he gets "caught" and his hand is held in a lock for 30 seconds. From ''Crime Time'', the next jump for his restless mind was the Apology Line, created after he moved to Manhattan in 1977.&lt;ref name=apology&gt;[http://www.apologyline.com/bridge.html Apology Line: Allan Bridge]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridge sold rights for a film and novel. ''Mr. Apology'' by [[Campbell Armstrong|Campbell Black]] was published by [[Ballantine Books]] in 1984, and this was adapted by screenwriter [[Mark Medoff]] for the HBO thriller, ''Apology'' (1986). The film switched the sex of the conceptual artist from male to female (portrayed by [[Lesley Ann Warren]]).

In 1993, Bridge was the subject of a long article, "The Confession," by [[Alec Wilkinson]], published in the October 4, 1993 issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Alec. "The Confession," ''The New Yorker'', October 4, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson's article was reprinted a decade later in ''Mr. Apology and Other Essays'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Alec. ''Mr. Apology and Other Essays''. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confessions==
Some confessions taped from the Apology phone calls were published in ''Apology'', a magazine edited and published by Bridge. The last issue was published January 1996. After investigating the notion of bringing the [[Apology Project]] to the online service [[GEnie]], he was working on a book about the Apology Line and making plans in 1995 to expand the Apology confessions to the Internet.

In 1989, his second wife, Marissa Bridge, founded Marissa Bridge Studios, which became one of New York’s leading decorative painting and restoration companies, with offices in Manhattan and the Hamptons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marissabridge.com/ Marissa Bridge Studios]&lt;/ref&gt; Active in boating and scuba diving, Bridge was diving in August 1995, when he was killed by a hit-and-run [[jet ski]]er. Lydia Nibley wrote about this in her essay "All Apologies" (December 16, 2004):
:The man's heavily accented voice hesitated only briefly before he confessed to multiple murders: "I want to apologize. I don't know if even what I did was wrong or right, but when I was in Israel for six months, I killed six Arabs at night with a gang of other Jewish settlers. At the time we thought -- I believed -- we were fighting for our homeland to keep it from the Arabs. But perhaps now that I'm here in America, I realize that maybe killing is not the right way, and I want to apologize."

:This message was left anonymously on a phone-message service called the Apology Line, where people recorded their confessions and also listened to others admit to acts of intentional cruelty, silly screw-ups, unfortunate and unintentional mistakes and, on occasion, even murder. From 1980 to 1995, Allan Bridge ran the line as something of a secular priest, offering the potential for forgiveness through the catharsis of taped confession&amp;mdash;until the day he was killed by a Jet-Skier who fled the scene and was never identified.

:Allan's wife, Marissa, was convinced that had her husband lived, he would have forgiven the person who hit him. But does that Jet-Skier&amp;mdash;who was seen circling back to confirm that it wasn't driftwood, but a man in scuba gear he had hit&amp;mdash;live the rest of his life plagued by remorse and guilt? And would confessing to someone, anyone, even anonymously, make a difference?...

:When asked if she is sure Allan would have been able to forgive the Jet-Skier who hit him&amp;mdash;even without an apology&amp;mdash;Marissa Bridge imagines several scenarios. "The person knew it was an accident and that it wasn't his fault," she says. "He couldn't have predicted a scuba diver would surface at that moment right in front of him. Maybe the person was really young and gave into the impulse to run away rather than to stay and face things. I'm sure whoever they are, they are sorry."

:She explains that listening to Allan's collection of tapes from the Apology Line helps her understand that the average person is in some level of pain about past actions, and that people who have bigger regrets have a larger burden to carry. "Allan was a petty criminal in his early life, and he worried that people could fall too easily into being either the predator or the prey. He lived his life to say, 'Let's see if we can be better people.'"

Several passages about Bridge and jet skis are scattered throughout ''The Unwanted Sound of Everything We Want: A Book About Noise '' by Garret Keizer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1586485520 Keizer, Garret. ''The Unwanted Sound of Everything We Want: A Book About Noise'', PublicAffairs, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Play==
''Apology'', a new theatrical piece based on the life and work of Allan Bridge, is being developed by Greg Pierotti, co-writer of ''[[The Laramie Project]]''.&lt;ref name=apology/&gt;

==Exhibitions==
A bank of phone booths were installed for Bridge's 1981 show at the New Museum, enabling guests to pick listen directly to the original Apology Line tapes.&lt;ref name=apology/&gt;

==Awards==
The film ''Apology'' won the Audience Award at the 1987 Cognac Festival du Film Policier, and that same year it won a CableACE Award for [[Maurice Jarre]]'s music score.

==SEALAB III==
[[File:SEALAB III.jpg|right|thumb|200px|SEALAB III]]
In 1969, Cannon was assigned to Team One for the SEALAB III project, which would take place off [[San Clemente Island]]. He was one of four members of Team One assigned to open and secure the habitat, alongside fellow aquanauts [[Robert A. Barth]], [[Richard Blackburn (diver)|Richard Blackburn]] and [[John Reaves (diver)|John Reaves]]. On February 16, 1969, the SEALAB III [[Underwater habitat|habitat]] sprang a leak. Cannon, Barth, Blackburn and Reaves were twice sent down to SEALAB in the Personnel Transfer Capsule (PTC) in an attempt to repair the problem.&lt;ref name="San Diego 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hellwarth3"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V4sbNMwQJI4C&amp;pg=PT171 Hellwarth], pp. 171-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after 0500 hours on February 17, Cannon began to convulse while working on the exterior of the habitat. Barth tried to save him, holding his head in the breathable gas pocket of the skirt surrounding SEALAB's entrance and unsuccessfully attempting to force the mouthpiece of the emergency [[aqua-lung]] [[Diving regulator|regulator]] between Cannon's teeth. Finally, Barth dragged Cannon back toward the PTC, where his fellow aquanauts helped him bring Cannon inside and Reaves and Blackburn attempted resuscitation.&lt;ref name="San Diego 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecott"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ecott|first=Tim|title=Neutral Buoyancy: Adventures in a Liquid World|publisher=[[Atlantic Monthly Press]]|location=New York|year=2001|pages=264–266|isbn=0-87113-794-1|lccn=2001018840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Dw7htaxwtUC&amp;pg=PA265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hellwarth4"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V4sbNMwQJI4C&amp;pg=PT181 Hellwarth], pp. 181-184.&lt;/ref&gt; When the PTC reached the surface it was obvious that Cannon was dead. His body was placed in the outer airlock of the deck [[decompression chamber]] (DDC), returned to surface pressure and brought to [[San Diego Naval Hospital]].&lt;ref name="San Diego 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hellwarth5"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V4sbNMwQJI4C&amp;pg=PT185 Hellwarth], pp. 185-186.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannon's funeral was held at [[Humphrey Mortuary]] in [[Chula Vista, California]], on February 19. He was buried at [[Wacahoota Baptist Cemetery]] in [[central Florida]].&lt;ref name="Hellwarth1"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
It was widely reported in the news media that Cannon had died of a [[heart attack]].&lt;ref name="San Diego 3"/&gt; However, the official board of inquiry, held in [[San Diego]] from February 28 to March 12, 1969, concluded that Cannon had in fact died of [[carbon dioxide poisoning]]. The carbon dioxide-scrubbing baralyme canister on Cannon's Mark IX diving rig was empty. The SEALAB III aquanauts, including Cannon, did not set up their own diving rigs.  The identity of the person who failed to refill the baralyme canister was never determined.&lt;ref name="San Diego 3"/&gt; SEALAB [[medical officer]] [[Paul G. Linweaver]] later suggested that Cannon would have realized his equipment was faulty had he not been suffering from extreme cold due to breathing pressurized [[helium]].&lt;ref name="Popular Science"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PioDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|journal=[[Popular Science]]|last=Fisher|first=Arthur|title=Science Newsfront|date=September 1969|volume=195|issue=3|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgeon commander [[John Rawlins (Royal Navy)|John Rawlins]], a [[Royal Navy]] medical officer assigned to the project, also suggested that [[hypothermia]] was a contributing factor.&lt;ref name=RRR6248&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Michael|title=Immersion hypothermia in scuba diving.|journal=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal]]|volume=9|issue=2|year=1979|url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6248|accessdate=July 29, 2011}} (reprint from ''[[New Zealand Journal of Sports Medicine]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John Piña Craven]], the U.S. Navy's head of the [[Deep Submergence Systems Project]] of which SEALAB was a part, SEALAB III had been "plagued with strange failures at the very start of operations". According to Craven, while the other divers were undergoing the weeklong [[decompression (diving)|decompression]], repeated attempts were made to sabotage their air supply by someone aboard the command barge. Eventually, a guard was posted on the decompression chamber and the men were recovered safely. A potentially unstable suspect was identified by the staff psychiatrist but the culprit was never prosecuted. Craven suggests this may have been done to spare the Navy bad press so soon after the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'']] incident.&lt;ref name="Craven"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craven|first=John Piña|authorlink=John Piña Craven|title=The Silent War: The Cold War Battle Beneath the Sea|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|year=2001|pages=160–161|isbn=0-684-87213-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ih8MVZlibxYC&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it has been suggested that Cannon's death was a [[murder]].&lt;ref name="Database"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilmergulho.com.br/port/util/download/arquivos/RB_Fatal_Accident_Database_100725.xls|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325034800/http://www.brasilmergulho.com.br/port/util/download/arquivos/RB_Fatal_Accident_Database_100725.xls|archivedate=March 25, 2012|title=Diver Rebreather Fatalities Database Extract|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Cannon was married to Mary Lou Cannon and had three sons.&lt;ref name="Hellwarth1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollien"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hollien|first1=Harry|last2=Thompson|first2=Carl L.|last3=Cannon|first3=Berry|title=Speech Intelligibility as a Function of Ambient Pressure and HeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Atmosphere|journal=Aerospace Medicine|volume=44|year=1973|pages=249–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for seldom complaining if his complaint would go against command authority.&lt;ref name="San Diego 3"/&gt; He enjoyed reading the works of [[Zane Grey]].&lt;ref name="Hellwarth2"/&gt;

==Memorial==
The Berry L. Cannon Memorial Aquarium was dedicated in 1970 to the distinguished honor and memory of Berry L. Cannon. It is now part of the [http://mss.citrusschools.org/berrylcannonmemorial.htm Citrus County School District's Marine Science Station] in [[Crystal River, FL]].

'''''Bicentennial Man''''' is a 1999 Canadian-American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[comedy-drama film]]&lt;!--The film is considered a comedy-drama film, so please do not remove "comedy", Thank You --&gt; starring [[Robin Williams]], [[Sam Neill]], [[Embeth Davidtz]] (in a dual role), [[Wendy Crewson]], and [[Oliver Platt]]. Based on the novel ''[[The Positronic Man]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Robert Silverberg]] (which is itself based on Asimov's original [[The Bicentennial Man|novella of the same name]]), the plot explores issues of [[Human condition|humanity]], [[slavery]], [[prejudice]], [[Maturity (psychological)|maturity]], [[intellectual freedom]], [[conformity]], [[sex]], [[love]], and [[death|mortality]]. The film, a co-production between [[Touchstone Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], was directed by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]. The title comes from the main character existing to the age of two hundred years, and Asimov's novella was published in the year the United States had its [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]].

Despite being a [[box office bomb]], makeup artist [[Greg Cannom]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]] at the [[72nd Academy Awards]], and the film has drawn a [[cult following]]. The theme song of the film which was written by James Horner and Will Jennings and sung by [[Celine Dion]] is "[[Then You Look at Me]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://moviemusicuk.us/1999/12/17/bicentennial-man-james-horner/ |first=Jonathan |last=Broxton |title=Bicentennial Man – James Horner |website=Movie Music UK |date=December 17, 1999 |accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The NDR series [[robot]] "Andrew" is introduced in 2005 into the Martin family home to perform housekeeping and maintenance duties. The family's reactions range from acceptance and curiosity, to outright rejection, and deliberate vandalism by their rebellious older daughter, Grace, who treats him as a mere robot and continues with her rebellious ways while growing up. This leads Andrew to discover that he can both identify emotions and reciprocate in kind. When Andrew accidentally breaks a figurine belonging to "Little Miss" Amanda, he carves a replacement out of wood, as way to apologize to her. The family is astonished by this creativity and “Sir” Richard Martin takes Andrew to his manufacturer, to inquire if all the robots are like him. The CEO of the company, Dennis Mansky, sees this development as a problem and wishes to scrap Andrew. Angered, Richard takes Andrew home and allows him to pursue his own development, encouraging Andrew to educate himself in the humanities.

Years later, Martin again takes Andrew to NorthAm Robotics for repairs following an accident in which his thumb is accidentally cut off. Richard ensures first that Andrew's personality will remain un-tampered with. Andrew requests his face be altered to convey the emotions he feels but cannot fully express, while he is being repaired. Twelve years later, Andrew eventually asks for his freedom, much to Richard's dismay. He grants the request, but banishes Andrew so he can be 'completely' free. Andrew builds himself a home and lives alone. In 2048, Andrew sees Richard one last time on his deathbed, where he apologizes for banishing him.

Andrew goes on a quest to locate more NDR series robots to discover if others have also developed sentience. After nearly twenty years of failure, he finds Galatea, an NDR robot that has been given feminine attributes and personality. These, however, are simply aspects of her programming and not something which she spontaneously developed. Galatea is owned by Rupert Burns, son of the original NDR robot designer. Burns works to create more human-looking robots, but is unable to attract funding. Andrew agrees to finance the research and the two join forces to revolutionize robotics. He meanwhile maintains contact with Amanda, who grew up, married, had a child, divorced and now has a granddaughter called Portia. After receiving human features, Andrew comes back home, and sees Amanda, now aged, with Portia, who is the same as her grandmother in her younger years. Initially he has some troubles reintegrating into the family since now there is only Amanda who actually knows him, but he manages to befriend Portia.

Some time later, Amanda passes away, leaving Andrew to realise that everyone he knows will die one day. Accepting this fact, Andrew decides to become human. With the help of Rupert, he creates a new type of mechanical organs that can be used both by him to become more human and used by humans as prosthetic organs. He gains a [[nervous system]] and lots of other organs that make him able to eat, to feel emotions and sensations, and also to have sexual intercourse. Eventually, Andrew becomes human enough to fall in love with Portia and, ultimately, she falls in love with him.

Over the course of the next century, Andrew petitions the World Congress to recognize him as human, which would allow him and Portia to be legally married, but is rejected; the Speaker of the Congress explains that society can tolerate an everlasting machine, but argues that an immortal human would create too much jealousy and anger. Initially Andrew decides to make Portia live as much as possible through his medical inventions but after some decades she tells him that she can't and doesn't want to live forever, so one day she will refuse any more treatment. Andrew decides to make Burns inject [[blood]] into his system, thereby allowing him to age, and thus he begins to grow old alongside Portia.

Andrew again attends the World Congress with Portia, both now appearing old and frail, and again petitions to be declared a human being. On their death bed with [[life support]], Andrew and Portia watch as the Speaker of the World Congress announces on television the court's decision: that Andrew is officially recognized as human, and (aside from "[[Methuselah]] and other Biblical characters") is the oldest human being in history at the age of two-hundred years old. The Speaker also validates the marriage between Portia and Andrew. Andrew dies while listening to the broadcast despite his life support, and Portia orders their nurse Galatea, a now recognizably-human android, to unplug her life support. Portia dies hand-in-hand with Andrew after she whispers "See you soon" to him.

==Production==
Williams confirmed in a ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' interview that his character was not played by a [[body double]] and that he had actually worn the robot costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neil|first=Dave|title=Robin Williams reveals the mechanics of making ‘Bicentennial Man’|date=23 December 1999|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/1999/dec/23/robin-williams-reveals-the-mechanics-of-making-bic/|accessdate=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film holds a 36% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 96 critical reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Bicentennial Man'' is ruined by a bad script and ends up being dull and mawkish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bicentennial_man |title=Bicentennial Man (1999) |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review aggregator [[Metacritic]] gives it a score of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/bicentennial-man |title=Bicentennial Man |website=Metacritic |accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave it two out of four stars: {{cquote|''Bicentennial Man'' begins with promise, proceeds in fits and starts, and finally sinks into a cornball drone of greeting-card sentiment. [[Robin Williams]] spends the first half of the film encased in a metallic robot suit, and when he emerges, the script turns robotic instead. What a letdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991217/REVIEWS/912170302/1023 |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Bicentennial Man |first=Roger |last=Ebert |date=December 17, 1999 |accessdate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
William Arnold of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' said: {{cquote| [The film] becomes a somber, sentimental and rather profound romantic fantasy that is more true to the spirit of the Golden Age of science-fiction writing than possibly any other movie of the '90s.}}
Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' summed it up as "an ambitious tale handled in a dawdling, sentimental way."

'''Brian Harman''' (born January 19, 1987) is an American [[professional golfer]] who plays on the [[PGA Tour]].  He is one of the few left-handed players on tour.

==Amateur career==
In college, Harman was a three-time 2nd Team All-American on the [[University of Georgia]] golf team.  He won the 2005 NCAA Preview and the 2006 Isleworth Invitational. He also won the yearly award for highest Grade Point Average three times.

In 2003, Harman won the [[U.S. Junior Amateur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usjunioram.org/history/past-champions/2003.html 2003 Junior Amateur]&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[Players Amateur]] in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playersam.com/pastchampions.html Players Amateur champions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209063232/http://www.playersam.com/pastchampions.html |date=February 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Porter Cup]] in 2007, shooting a tournament record 22-under-par 258.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portercup.com/champions.htm Porter Cup champions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050415040438/http://www.portercup.com/champions.htm |date=April 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harman played on the winning [[2005 Walker Cup|2005]] and [[2009 Walker Cup]] and 2007 [[Palmer Cup]] teams.

==Professional career==
In 2010, Harman played mostly on the [[EGolf Professional Tour]] finishing in the top-10 in 11 of his 14 starts.  He gained his first pro victory at the Manor Classic where he won by three shots. He also played in three [[Nationwide Tour]] events in 2010. His best showing came at the [[Stadion Athens Classic at UGA]] where he placed T-18th on his former college course.

Harman was known for a unique situation at the [[2012 Players Championship]]. He was the first alternate when [[D. A. Points]] withdrew just minutes before his tee time. Playing partners [[Carl Pettersson]] and [[Robert Garrigus]] had already teed off and after consulting with the PGA, tournament officials allowed Harman to tee off alone for the first round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://golfweek.com/2012/05/10/brian-harman-left-out-after-points-withdraws/ |title=Alternate Harman squeezes into Players field |magazine=Golfweek |date=May 10, 2012 |first=Jim |last=McCabe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harman eventually got partnered with [[Ryan Moore (golfer)|Ryan Moore]] and [[Bud Cauley]] for round two after [[Paul Casey]] withdrew. Harman made the cut and finished T51.

Harman later qualified for his first major, the [[2012 U.S. Open (golf)|2012 U.S. Open]]. His first PGA Tour win was the 2014 [[John Deere Classic]]. In 2015, Harman held the 54 hole lead at the [[Travelers Championship]], but would miss the playoff, won by [[Bubba Watson]], by one stroke and finished in solo third.

On August 30, 2015, at [[The Barclays]] at [[Plainfield Country Club]] in [[Edison, New Jersey]], Harman became the third player in PGA Tour history to have two [[Hole in one|aces]] in the same round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sbnation.com/golf/2015/8/30/9228129/brian-harman-aces-twice-barclays-2015-video |title=PGA Tour pro makes incredible two holes-in-one in same round at Barclays |publisher=SB Nation |first=Brendan |last=Porath |date=August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2017, Harman won the [[Wells Fargo Championship]] held at Eagle Point Golf Club in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], for his second PGA Tour win. Harman made a 28-foot putt on the 18th hole to win by one stroke over [[Dustin Johnson]] and [[Pat Perez]], who finished at 9-under-par.

Harman held the 54-hole lead at the [[2017 U.S. Open (golf)|2017 U.S. Open]] played at [[Erin Hills]] in Erin, Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;http://golfweek.com/2017/06/17/pga-tour-live-blog-2017-us-open-at-erin-hills-round-3/&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the final round one stroke clear of three players, at 12 under par, and was the first time he had played in the final group of a major during the final round. He finished in a tie for second place with [[Hideki Matsuyama]], four strokes behind winner [[Brooks Koepka]], following a final round 72.

==Personal life==
Harman resides in [[Sea Island, Georgia]] with his wife Kelly Van Slyke.

&lt;!--end wikitable--&gt;On the morning of 3 December 2001, Lindor and Emmanuel Espoir Clédanor, a former journalist for ''Radio Plus'', were in route to the village of [[Miragoâne]].&lt;ref name=unhchr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/TestFrame/233ec1205137a966c1256b740056c319?Opendocument|title=Written statement submitted by the|work=unhchr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they reached L'Acul, approximately 5&amp;nbsp;km outside of Petit-Goâve, their vehicle was attacked by members of “Dómi Nan Bwa", who are supporters of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party.&lt;ref name=haitian-truth /&gt;&lt;ref name=haitipolicy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haitipolicy.org/2002/12/murder-of-journalist-brignol-lindor-one-year-of-impunity|title=Murder of Journalist Brignol Lindor: One Year of Impunity|work=Haiti Democracy Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clédanor managed to escape unharmed.

Just three days prior to Lindor's murder, Dumay Bony, the deputy mayor of Petit-Goâve, referred to Lindor as a terrorist, and encouraged others to apply the policy of "zero tolerance", which was a euphemism for lynching, to Lindor and a list of others considered to be affiliated with the [[Convergence Démocratique|opposition]].&lt;ref name=investigation /&gt;&lt;ref name=RSF&gt;{{cite web|title=Haiti: Two years of impunity since Brignol Lindor's brutal murder|url=http://en.rsf.org/haiti-two-years-of-impunity-since-03-12-2003,08663.html |publisher=Reporters Without Borders|accessdate=October 21, 2015|date=December 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindor became a specific target of this policy, because of his recent invitation to members of the Convergence Démocratique to appear on his radio show "Dialogue". The group openly criticized the governance of President Aristide and his Fanmi Lavalas Party.&lt;ref name=haitian-truth /&gt;&lt;ref name=RSF /&gt;

== Context ==
[[File:Petit-Goâve 1981 (Flickr).jpg|right|250px|thumb|Petit-Goâve from around 1981.]]Haiti has experienced several long periods of political tension, one of which can be traced back to the decision by a group of small political organizations to boycott the presidential elections of 2000.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite news|last=Garcia Zamor |first=Jean-Claude |title=Haiti in 2001 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=31 December 2001 |accessdate=27 September 2015  |pages= |language= | url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Haiti-Year-In-Review-2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This boycott was their way of protesting the [[Haitian parliamentary election, 2000|parliamentary elections]] earlier that year, which they claimed had fraudulently awarded 15 of the 19 Senate seats and eighty percent of seats in the House of Assembly to Jean Bertrand Aristide's newly formed Fanmi Lavalas party.&lt;ref name=historycommons&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Context of 'May 21, 2000: Parliamentary and Local Elections Marred by Controversy in Haiti' |publisher=History Commons |date= |accessdate=27 September 2015  |pages= |language= |url=http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=the_2004_removal_of_jean-bertrand_aristide_566#the_2004_removal_of_jean-bertrand_aristide_566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This group of political organizations later joined together to form an alliance known as the Convergence Démocratique, also referred to as the "opposition," which sought to undermine the authority of President Aristide.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Directly related to this political tension, the beginning of 2001 marked an enormous decline in press freedom in Haiti, with close to 40 journalists having faced violent threats or attacks in that year alone.&lt;ref name=unhchr /&gt; The majority of these threats and attacks were initiated by either police or supporters of President Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas Party, therefore greatly reducing the likelihood of any government intervention on behalf of the victims of this violence.&lt;ref name=unhchr /&gt; That situation was a direct result of President Aristide's instatement of a "zero tolerance" campaign against crime in June of that year.&lt;ref name=CPJ /&gt; Through this campaign, police officers were allowed and even encouraged to punish criminals on the spot, without a trial, if they are caught red-handed.&lt;ref name=CPJ /&gt; Members of the press/media in Haiti were often characterized by President Aristide as members of the opposition, but such allegations served as a way of justifying the violence that was being committed against them, regardless of whether or not the allegations were in fact true.&lt;ref name=unhchr /&gt;

Lindor has not been the only journalist to be killed in Haiti, as in 2000 [[Jean Dominique|Jean Léopold Dominique]] of [[Radio Haiti-Inter]] and Gérard Denoze of Radio Plus met the same fate.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune/&gt;

== Impact ==
Lindor proved to be a prominent and influential voice for democracy in Haiti, specifically in his small town of Petit-Goâve. He did not associate himself with any one political group, but instead used his position at Radio Echo 2000 to give all groups the chance to share their views and opinions.&lt;ref name=refworld/&gt; The nature of Lindor's murder was especially gruesome, and acted as a new kind of warning for all members of the media that are considered to be aligned with the opposition.&lt;ref name=refworld/&gt; A dozen other journalists were so afraid that they would meet the same fate as Lindor that they fled the country soon after his murder.&lt;ref name=refworld/&gt;

Lindor was not the only Haitian journalist to be killed by supporters of Aristide, but his murder led to a particular increase in outrage toward Aristide's administration, causing the people of Petit-Goâve, followed by both national and international communities, to organize protests and even riots that demanded justice for Lindor.&lt;ref name=haitiobserver /&gt;

He is one example across the region of journalists who have been threatened by politicians and killed as a result.&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-03-20/news/0203200164_1_journalists-inter-american-press-association-brignol-lindor|title=Journalists attacked in S. America, Haiti|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
[[UNESCO]] Director-General [[Koïchiro Matsuura]] condemned the murder, saying, "The murder of Brignol Lindor, in horrific circumstances, will cause indignation among all who believe in the democratic future of Haiti and all those who struggle for freedom of expression. I request the highest authorities of the country to make all resources available to investigators so that this heinous crime will not go unpunished. A society that endeavors to heal the wounds of the past and build a democratic future needs all forums of expression and dialogue."&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization|work=UNESCO Press|url=http://www.unesco.org/bpi/eng/unescopress/2001/01-131e.shtml|date=December 6, 2001|accessdate=2012-10-21|title=Director-General Expresses Indignation at Murder of Haitian Journalist Brignol Lindor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a full year after Lindor was murdered, more than 8,000 protesters walked through the streets of Petit-Goâve, Haiti, on 18 November 2002, and chanted "Down with Aristide!" and "Justice for Brignol!" according to a report by [[Radio Vision 2000]]&lt;ref name=orlandosentinel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2002-11-19/news/0211190105_1_haiti-aristide-slain|title=Thousands March To Demand Justice For Slain Journalist|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first anniversary of his murder, his brother Moreno issued a call for justice through [[Reporters Without Borders]], saying, "I was at home the day I heard he had been chopped to death. I feared it was the end for my family. I was wrong. But we were threatened and had to flee the country. A year later, the killers can still count on the inertia of the authorities. The hardest thing is the injustice of it, that nobody has been punished. My brother was killed because he allowed everyone to speak on the radio. Haitians must be given their say and Brignol must be given justice."&lt;ref name="haitipolicy"/&gt;

[[Image:Schlachtschussapparat (modified).jpg|upright=0.4|thumb|Captive bolt pistol]]
[[Image:TED Stunner Captive Bolt Technology.jpg#file|thumb|right|240px|Modern captive bolt device]]

A '''captive bolt pistol''' or '''gun''' (also variously known as a '''cattle gun''', '''stunbolt gun''', '''bolt gun''', or '''stunner''') is a device used for [[stunning]] animals prior to [[Slaughter (livestock)|slaughter]].

The goal of captive bolt stunning is to inflict a forceful strike on the [[forehead]] with the bolt in order to induce [[unconsciousness]]. The bolt may or may not destroy part of the [[brain]].

The bolt consists of a heavy rod made of corrosion-resistant alloys, such as [[stainless steel]]. It is held in position inside the barrel of the stunner by means of rubber [[washer (hardware)|washer]]s. The bolt is usually not visible in a stunner in good condition. The bolt is actuated by a [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] pull and is propelled forward by compressed air, spring mechanism, or by the discharge of a [[blank (cartridge)|blank round]] ignited by a [[firing pin]]. After striking a shallow but forceful blow on the forehead of the animal, spring tension causes the bolt to recoil back into the barrel.

The captive bolt pistol was invented in 1903 by Dr. Hugo Heiss, former director of a [[slaughterhouse]] in [[Straubing]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Animal revolution : changing attitudes toward speciesism|date=2000|publisher=New York|location=Oxford|isbn=9781859733301}}{{Page needed|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
Captive bolt pistols are of three types: penetrating, non-penetrating, and free bolt. The use of penetrating captive bolts has largely been discontinued in commercial situations in order to minimize the risk of transmission of disease.

In the '''penetrating''' type, the stunner uses a pointed bolt which is propelled by pressurized air, spring mechanism, or a blank cartridge. The bolt penetrates the [[skull]] of the animal, enters the cranium, and catastrophically damages the [[Telencephalon|cerebrum]] and part of the [[cerebellum]]. [[Concussion]] causes destruction of vital centers of the [[brain]], and an increase in [[intracranial pressure]], the animal loses consciousness. This method is currently the most effective type of stunning, since it physically destroys [[white matter|brain matter]] (increasing the probability of a successful stun), while also leaving the [[brain stem]] intact and thus ensuring the heart continues to pump during the [[Exsanguination#The slaughtering of animals in the meat industry|exsanguination]].&lt;ref name="Schütt-Abraham 1992"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schütt-Abraham|first=I|last2=Knauer-Kraetzl|first2=B|last3=Wormuth|first3=HJ|date=January 1992|title=[Observations during captive bolt stunning of rabbits]|pmid=1543476|journal=Berliner und Munchener tierarztliche Wochenschrift|language=de|volume=105|issue=1|issn=0005-9366}}&lt;/ref&gt; One disadvantage of this method is that brain matter is allowed to enter the [[blood stream]], possibly contaminating other tissue with [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE, colloquially known as mad cow disease).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anil|first=M. H.|last2=Helps|first2=C. R.|last3=McKinstry|first3=J. L.|last4=Brown|first4=S.

[[Image:Cash's captive bolt pistol.jpg|thumb|right|A captive bolt pistol]]

The action of a '''non-penetrating''' stunner is similar, but the bolt is blunt with a mushroom-shaped tip. The bolt strikes the forehead with great force and immediately retracts. This concussion is responsible for the unconsciousness of the animal. This type of stunner is less reliable at causing immediate and permanent unconsciousness than penetrating types; however, it has undergone a resurgence of popularity because of concerns about [[mad cow disease]]. In the [[European Union]], this captive bolt design is required for slaughter of animals that will be used for [[pharmaceutical]] manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/bwp/TSE%20NFG%20410-rev2.pdf |title=Note for guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114180833/http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/bwp/TSE%20NFG%20410-rev2.pdf# |archive-date=2009-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''free bolt stunner''' is used for emergency, in-the-field [[animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] of large farm-animals that cannot be restrained. It differs from a true captive bolt gun in that the projectile is not retractable; it is similar in operation to a [[powder-actuated tool|powder-actuated]] [[nail gun]] or conventional firearm. Capable of firing only when pressed firmly against a surface (typically the animal's forehead), the device fires a small projectile through the animal's skull. The [[veterinarian]] can then either leave the animal to die from the projectile wound or administer lethal drugs.

==Use==
With cattle, goats, sheep, rabbits, and horses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beam |first=Christopher |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2212233/ |title=They Shoot Horses, Don't They? |publisher=Slate.com |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; failure to adequately stun using a penetrating stunner can largely be attributed to incorrect positioning.&lt;ref name="Schütt-Abraham 1992"/&gt; Captive bolts allow for meat trimmings from the head to be salvaged. In some [[veal]] operations, a non-penetrating concussive stunner is used in order to preserve the brains for further processing.

Captive bolt stunners are safer to use in most red meat slaughter situations. There is no danger of [[ricochet]] or over-penetration as there is with regular firearms.

The cartridges typically use 2 to 3 [[Grain (measure)|grain]]s (130 to 190&amp;nbsp;mg) of [[smokeless powder]] but can use up to 7 grains (450&amp;nbsp;mg) in the case of large animals such as bulls. The velocity of the bolt is usually {{convert|55|m/s|ft/s}} in the case of small animals and {{convert|75|m/s|ft/s}} in the case of large animals.

==Use for homicide==
There have been a number of cases where a captive bolt pistol has been used for homicide, including:
* A 46-year-old German man with a history of alcohol abuse and aggressive behaviour killed his wife&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Betz |first=Peter |url=http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/7477/1/eisenmenger_wolfgang_7477.pdf |title=Homicide with  a Captive Bolt Pistol|publisher=Raven Press |date=1993 |accessdate=2012-10-27|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An English slaughterman killed a woman with two shots to the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bolt-gun murder 'not predictable'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-15636199|accessdate=2017-12-22|work=BBC News|date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fiction===
* In the novel ''[[No Country for Old Men]]'' and its [[No Country for Old Men (film)|film adaption]], [[Anton Chigurh]] uses a captive bolt pistol as a murder weapon.
* In the 1992 movie [[Benny's Video]] by the Austrian director [[Michael Haneke]] the murder of a young girl is perpetrated with a captive bolt pistol.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5621">'''Cayetano Apablasa Blanco''' (or '''Apablaza'''; 1847–1889) was a 19th-century land owner and politician in [[Los Angeles, California]]. His holdings were on the south of the central [[Los Angeles Plaza]], later the first site of the city's [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] and location of present-day [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]].

==Personal==

Apablasa was born April 13, 1847, in San Diego, California.  He was the son of Juan Apablasa (or Apablaza) of [[Chile]], who came to Mexican [[Alta California]] about 1839, and to [[Pueblo de Los Ángeles]] in 1843. His mother was María del Espíritu Santo Blanco. He had 7 siblings. Cayetano attended [[parochial school]].&lt;ref name=LibraryFile/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biographies&gt;[http://www.lagenealogy.com/Biographies/biosA.htm "Biographies of Famous  Citizens," LAGenealogy.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706073304/http://www.lagenealogy.com/Biographies/biosA.htm |date=2010-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/166632178/13989608BD612D11180/7?accountid=6749 "R.J.

He was married in Los Angeles to Concepcion Carasco (or Carrasco), and they had two sons and three daughters—John Vincent, Cayetano John (who later became a dentist), Mary (Mrs. Maria Conley, or Mrs. Lita Bernstein), Candelaria or Conchita (Mrs. Finlay), and Laura (Mrs. Thesing).&lt;ref&gt;Gia claimed, without a source, that the Apablasas had "ten children that ranged from one to 21 years of age."&lt;/ref&gt; The family home was in a seven-acre orchard near the [[Los Angeles Plaza|Old Plaza]].&lt;ref name=LibraryFile/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/167669841/139895E49647424D3E0/1?accountid=6749 "Dr. C.J. Apablasa, Pioneer Dentist, Dies," ''Los Angeles Times,'' July 11, 1960, page B-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died November 14, 1889, several weeks after he was [[Equestrianism#Health issues|thrown from his horse]] in an accident.&lt;ref name=LibraryFile&gt;[http://dbase1.lapl.org/webpics/calindex/documents/03/195435.pdf Los Angeles Public Library reference file]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Biographies/&gt; His widow married [[Juan Maria Sepulveda|Ildefonso A.

==Career==

After he left school at age seventeen, he entered the Wilmington Shipbuilding Company in [[Wilmington, California|Wilmington]] and served there during the [[American Civil War]], until 1869. After the war, he opened a [[blacksmithery]] or a wagon shop at 99 Alameda Street.&lt;ref name=LibraryFile/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biographies/&gt;&lt;ref name=GilbertGia/&gt; His later activities involved the extensive real estate holdings of his family. In 1985 the ''Los Angeles Times'' noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The family built what was believed to be the city's first frame house but it was moved in 1933 to make room for what was then [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Passenger Terminal]], the nation's newest train depot when it opened in 1937–38. The Apablasa family was also responsible for Los Angeles' first subdivision, when late in the last century it sold land to Chinese residents who built the first [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]]. An "Apablasa Street" once ran through the Chinese quarter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/154203751/13989608BD612D11180/5?accountid=6749# "Salvador Apablasa, 75; Descendant of Pioneer Los Angeles Landowners," ''Los Angeles Times,'' March 22, 1985, page C-2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Public service===

Apablasa was elected to the [[Los Angeles Common Council]] on December 3, 1877, for a term ending in December 1878, representing the 1st Ward.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Chronological Record of Los Angeles City Officials,1850-1938,'' compiled under direction of Municipal Reference Library, City Hall, Los Angeles (March 1938, reprinted 1966). "Prepared ... as a report on Project No. SA 3123-5703-6077-8121-9900 conducted under the auspices of the [[Works Progress Administration]]," his position was "declared vacant" on May 2, 1878, but minutes printed in the ''Los Angeles Herald,'' showed that Apablasa was present at the meeting of May 2, 1878, and that he attended all meetings in 1878 through December 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the police committee.&lt;ref name=LibraryFile/&gt;

The [[Workingman's Party]] nominated him for the State Senate in 1880.&lt;ref name=Biographies/&gt;&lt;ref name=GilbertGia/&gt;

[[File:Leftsidedcerebellarstroke.PNG|thumb|Left sided cerebellar stroke due to occlusion of a vertebral artery]]
'''Cerebellar stroke syndrome''' is a condition in which the circulation to the [[cerebellum]] is impaired due to a [[lesion]] of the [[superior cerebellar artery]], [[anterior inferior cerebellar artery]] or the [[posterior inferior cerebellar artery]].&lt;ref name="UrbanWicht2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Urban |first1= P.P. |last2= Wicht |first2= S. |last3= Vukurevic |first3=G. |last4= Fitzek |first4= C. |last5= Fitzek |first5= S. |last6= Stoeter |first6= P. |last7= Massinger |first7= C. |last8= Hopf |first8= H.C. |displayauthors= 4 |title=Dysarthria in acute ischemic stroke: Lesion topography, clinicoradiologic correlation, and etiology |journal= [[Neurology (journal)|Neurology]] |volume= 56 |issue= 8 |year= 2001 |pages= 1021–7 |pmid= 11320172 |doi= 10.1212/WNL.56.8.1021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years [[mortality rates]] have decreased due to advancements in health care which include earlier [[diagnosis]] through [[MRI]] and [[CT scanning]].&lt;ref name="jensen"/&gt; Advancements have also been made which allow earlier management for common complications of cerebellar stroke such as [[brainstem]] compression and [[hydrocephalus]].&lt;ref name="jensen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jensen |first1= M.B. |last2= St. Louis |first2= E.K. |title= Management of acute cerebellar stroke |journal= [[JAMA Neurology|Archives of Neurology]] |volume= 62 |issue= 4 |year= 2005 |pages= 537–44 |url= http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=788140 |doi= 10.1001/archneur.62.4.537 |pmid= 15824250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research is still needed in the area of cerebellar stroke management; however, several factors may lead to poor outcomes in individuals who have a cerebellar stroke. These factors include:
# Declining levels of [[consciousness]]
# New signs of [[brainstem]] involvement
# Progressing [[Hydrocephalus]]
# Stroke to the midline of the cerebellum (a.k.a. the [[vermis]]) &lt;ref name="jensen"/&gt;

'''Chao''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|aʊ}}; {{Lang-ja|チャオ}}) are fictional life forms in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' video game series published by [[Sega]]. They are small, childlike creatures that go through a complex life cycle and exist in several visual forms depending on how they are raised. Developer [[Sonic Team]] incorporated Chao into the games to encourage players to explore levels and support the good–evil dichotomy of ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]''.

Chao have appeared in many games in the series, beginning with ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' in 1998. They usually take the form of [[digital pet]]s, but have also played parts in the story and figured into other gameplay elements. Most notably, the character [[Cream the Rabbit]] has a Chao named [[Cheese the Chao|Cheese]], whom she uses to attack enemies. They have also appeared in games outside the series, the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' comics, and the ''[[Sonic X]]'' anime, as well as being featured in promotions and merchandise. Critics have given mixed opinions on Chao and their integration into ''Sonic'' gameplay, generally praising their worth as a diversion but criticizing Chao minigames' low interactivity.

==Conception and characteristics==
[[File:Chaodrive.svg|thumb|upright|In ''Sonic Adventure 2'', the player can give Chao Chaos Drives to increase their stats, thus allowing them to perform better in minigames like Chao Karate.]]

[[Sonic Team]]'s [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]] stated in an interview with video game publication [[1UP.com]] that Chao were incorporated into ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' "so that new players would be forced to go out, explore the action sections, and find [[Flicky#Appearances in other games|Flickies]] and things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717081036/http://www.1up.com/features/afterthoughts-sonic-heroes |archivedate=July 17, 2012 |title=Afterthoughts: Sonic Heroes |publisher=1UP.com |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3116996 |accessdate=January 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chao were designed as a "relative neutral entity" in this game. However, to remain consistent with the good–evil dichotomy of ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', they were designed so that the player could raise them as "Hero Chao" or "Dark Chao". Chao were given the ability to socialize and interact in ''Sonic Adventure 2'' in order to make the game unique,&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview With Sonic Adventure 2 Director Takashi Iizuka|url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/095/095406p1.html|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=June 4, 2001|author=IGN Staff|accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to more resemble "a real artificial life form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-turns-10/1100-2782086/|publisher=GameSpot|date=July 2, 2001|last=Torres|first=Ricardo|title=Sonic the Hedgehog turns 10|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chao are small creatures with a [[pudding]]-like body and behave much like [[human]] [[infant]]s,&lt;ref name="laboratory"&gt;{{cite web|title=CHAO Laboratory|url=http://www.sonicteam.com/chao/index.html|publisher=[[Sega]]/[[Sonic Team]]|accessdate=December 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030801080715/http://www.sonicteam.com/chao/index.html|archivedate=August 1, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with pleasant and relaxing personalities.&lt;ref name="trophy"&gt;{{cite video game|quote='''Chao trophy:''' A type of creature that can absorb and learn skills and traits from other life-forms, adapting its shape as it does.

When the player spends enough time with a Chao in the Chao Garden, the Chao develops a [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]; it hatches from this as an adult. Eventually it develops another cocoon. If the Chao has been treated well, the cocoon is pink and the Chao is [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] as an egg; the cycle then restarts and the Chao remembers the player. If, however, the Chao has been treated poorly, the cocoon is gray and the Chao dies, removing every trace of itself from the game.&lt;ref name="laboratory"/&gt; Chao can [[Mating|breed]] to produce fertile eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Sonic Adventure 2: Battle|developer=Sega Studio USA|quote='''Professor Chao:''' You will be able to tell it's mating season when you see flowers blooming around your Chao.

==Appearances==

===In video games===
Chao have appeared in numerous ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' video games as [[digital pet]]s. They made their first appearance in the 1998 [[Dreamcast]] game ''Sonic Adventure''. The player can raise them, enter them in races,&lt;ref name="IGN sonic adventure"/&gt; and export them to ''Chao Adventure'', a game for the Dreamcast's [[VMU]] peripheral. The player can also trade Chao or post their high scores online using the Dreamcast's Internet capabilities.&lt;ref name="allgame sonic adventure"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209173615/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=19233 |archivedate=February 9, 2010 |title=Sonic Adventure - Overview |publisher=[[Allgame]] |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=19233 |last=Marriott |first=Scott Alan |accessdate=January 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chao raising feature was expanded in ''Sonic Adventure 2''; Chao may become "Hero Chao" or "Dark Chao" depending on whether the game's "hero" characters ([[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], [[Tails (character)|Miles "Tails" Prower]], and [[Knuckles the Echidna]]) or "dark" characters ([[Shadow the Hedgehog]], [[Doctor Eggman]], and [[Rouge the Bat]]) are nicer to them.

===In other media===
Chao were recurring characters in the ''[[Sonic X]]'' anime that ran from 2003 to 2006. In the episode "Little Chao Lost", Cheese becomes lost while swimming in a stream. The main characters find him at the stream's end, in a Chao colony, where [[Doctor Eggman]] shows up to steal a supposed [[Chaos Emerald]] from them until he is defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Little Chao Lost|episodelink=List of Sonic X episodes#Season 1: 2003-2004|series=[[Sonic X]]|airdate=August 31, 2003|season=1|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, in "Flood Fight", a colony of Chao appears after a battle with Chaos; they turn out to be Chaos' old friends and embrace it as it leaves with [[Tikal the Echidna]] to return to the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Flood Fight|episodelink=List of Sonic X episodes#Season 2: 2004-2005|series=[[Sonic X]]|airdate=November 9, 2003|season=2|number=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chao have also made occasional appearances in [[Archie Comics]]' ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' comic book series. They debuted in an ''Sonic Adventure''-based story arc, where they work together with Tikal to defeat Chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|story = Night of Chaos |title = [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]|issue = 82|date = February 2000|publisher = [[Archie Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles find a Chao garden and one Chao followed Sonic home, and after spending time around his Roboticized father came to resemble Omochao.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|story = See Ya Later Chao! - Part One |title = Sonic the Hedgehog|issue = 173|date = March 2007|publisher = Archie Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eggman destroys the garden, and the Chao migrate to a lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|story = See Ya Later Chao! - Part Two |title = Sonic the Hedgehog|issue = 174|date = April 2007|publisher = Archie Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much later, Cream and her mother Vanilla protect a frightened but incompetent group of Chao from Eggman's assistant, Snively. Cream's friend [[Amy Rose]] realizes they are the same group from the lake and, to Cream's delight, suggests that the lake can be converted to a Chao garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|story = Welcome Back, Chao! |title = Sonic the Hedgehog|issue = 217|date = September 2010|publisher = Archie Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the comic reboot, Cheese continued to accompany Cream while Chocola was revealed to live with her mother Vanilla and Gemerl (from [[Sonic Advance 3]]). The heroes would also discover a Chao Garden hidden in an undersea cavern whose inhabitants included an ancient Chao named Aquarius and a guard dog-like Chao named Crusher.

==Reception and impact==
Chao and the Chao-raising 
system have received generally positive reviews. In a review of ''Sonic Adventure'', [[GameSpot]]'s Peter Bartholow stated that "with the Chao-breeding simulation and the minigames, ''Sonic'' offers much more beyond the completion of its story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonic Adventure Review for Dreamcast|publisher=GameSpot|date=December 31, 1998|last=Bartholow|first=Peter|url=http://www.gamespot.com/dreamcast/action/sonicadventure/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;read-review|accessdate=January 24, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617044855/http://www.gamespot.com/sonic-adventure/reviews/sonic-adventure-review-2540626/|archivedate=June 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] stated that "''SA'' more than has the extras department covered."&lt;ref name="IGN sonic adventure"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonic Adventure Review|url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/160/160140p1.html|date=September 8, 1999|publisher=IGN|accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enthusiasm was extended to IGN's reviews of ''Sonic Adventure 2'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonic Adventure 2 Review|url=http://dreamcast.ign.com/articles/164/164855p1.html|date=June 22, 2001|publisher=IGN|accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sonic Advance'',&lt;ref name="IGN sonic advance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonic Advance Review|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/324/324071p1.html|last=Harris|first=Craig|date=February 5, 2002|publisher=IGN|accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut''.&lt;ref name="IGN sonic adventure dx"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut Review|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/425/425319p1.html|date=June 20, 2003|publisher=IGN|author=Casamassina, Matt|accessdate=December 30, 2009|authorlink=Matt Casamassina}}&lt;/ref&gt; GameSpot's Shane Satterfield was critical of the Chao raising feature in ''Sonic Adventure 2: Battle'', stating that "there's little in the way of interactivity" and that "the Chao training aspect using the Game Boy Advance is little more than a novelty."&lt;ref name="gamespot sonic adventure 2 battle"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sonic Adventure 2 Battle Review for GameCube|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/sonicadventure2battle/review.html?page=2|date=February 15, 2002|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=December 30, 2009|last=Satterfield|first=Shane|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106065609/http://www.gamespot.com/sonic-adventure-2-battle/reviews/sonic-adventure-2-battle-review-2848236/?page=2|archivedate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[GameSpy]]'s Shane Bettenhausen praised the feature in the game, comparing Chao to [[Tamagotchi]] digital pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews: Sonic Adventure 2: Battle (GCN)|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/february02/sa2bgc/index.shtm|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=January 12, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603233256/http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/february02/sa2bgc/index.shtm|archivedate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; GameSpot's Frank Provo noted the appeal to "those people who might only enjoy pinball in passing" that Chao brought to ''Sonic Pinball Party''.&lt;ref name="gamespot pinball"/&gt; [[1UP.com]]'s Chris Baker called the Chao feature in ''Sega Superstars'' "ultimately worthless... but some might find it amusing."&lt;ref name="1up sega superstars"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716154143/http://www.1up.com/reviews/sega-superstars_2 |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |title=Sega Superstars Review from 1UP.com |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=November 16, 2004 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |last=Baker |first=Chris |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3136633&amp;did=1 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of ''Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood'', GameSpot's Shiva Stella praised the level of strategy that the game's Chao system added.&lt;ref name="gamespot the dark brotherhood"/&gt; [[Destructoid]]'s Jim Sterling voiced a similar opinion, although saying that Chao had been "rubbish" in previous games.&lt;ref name="destructoid the dark brotherhood"&gt;{{cite web|title=Destructoid review: Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood|url=http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-sonic-chronicles-the-dark-brotherhood-105502.phtml|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|date=September 29, 2008|accessdate=February 2, 2010|last=Sterling|first=Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles "Charlie" Thompson Winters''' (February 10, 1913 &amp;ndash; October 29, 1984) was an [[United States|American]] businessman who volunteered during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].  He was imprisoned for 18 months for helping smuggle three [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] heavy bombers to [[Israel]] in the late 1940s, but [[Pardon#United States|pardoned]] posthumously by President [[George W. Bush]] on December 23, 2008.

==Early life==
Winters, the Protestant son of [[Scotland|Scotch]]-[[Canada|Canadian]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] parents, was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]&lt;ref name=Herald84&gt;{{cite news |title=CHARLES WINTERS, 71, AIDED BIRTH OF ISRAEL |publisher=Miami Herald |date=1984-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1913.&lt;ref name="Mac" /&gt; [[Polio]] struck him at an early age, leaving him with a limp.&lt;ref name=Herald84/&gt;  Because of this handicap, the [[United States Army]] rejected him during [[World War II]], and he instead spent the war working for the government as a purchasing agent.&lt;ref name=Herald84/&gt;

The three bombers smuggled by Winters were the only heavy bombers in the Israeli Air Force during the war, but were reportedly essential in turning the tide of war in Israel's favor.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081223/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_pardons |title=Bush pardons man who helped Israel during wartime |last=Reichmann |first=Deb |date=2008-12-23 |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=2008-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225181234/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081223/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_pardons |archivedate=December 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his diary on July 16, 1948, [[David Ben-Gurion]] noted their arrival in Israel, and mentioned that they had already been used  for several bombing runs in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Ben-Gurion |title=Israel: A Personal History |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls |place=New York |year=1971 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formed [[69 Squadron (Israel)|69 Squadron]] of the Israeli Air Force, known as the "Hammers".

'''Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP)''' is a term describing a temporary delay in the skeletal growth and thus height of a child with no physical abnormalities causing the delay.  Short stature may be the result of a growth pattern inherited from a parent (familial) or occur for no apparent reason (idiopathic).  Typically at some point during childhood, growth slows down, eventually resuming at a normal rate.  CDGP is the most common cause of [[short stature]] and delayed puberty.

==Background==
Children with '''constitutional delay of growth and puberty''' (CDGP), the most common cause of short stature and pubertal delay in males, typically have slowed linear growth within the first 3 years of life. In this variant of normal growth, linear growth velocity and weight gain slows beginning as young as age 3–6 months, resulting in downward crossing of growth percentiles, which often continues until age 2–3 years. At that time, growth resumes at a normal rate, and these children grow either along the lower growth percentiles or beneath the curve but parallel to it for the remainder of the prepubertal years.

At the expected time of puberty, the height of children with CDGP begins to drift further from the growth curve because of delay in the onset of the pubertal growth spurt. [[Catch-up growth]], onset of puberty, and pubertal growth spurt occur later than average, resulting in normal adult stature and sexual development. Although CDGP is a '''variant of normal growth''' rather than a disorder, delays in growth and sexual development may contribute to psychological difficulties, warranting treatment for some individuals. Recent studies have suggested that '''referral bias''' is largely responsible for the impression that normal short stature per se is a cause of psycho-social problems; non-referred children with short stature do not differ from those with more normal stature in school performance or socialization.

==Pathophysiology==

CDGP is a global delay in development that affects every organ system. Delays in growth and sexual development are quantified by skeletal age, which is determined from bone age radio-graphic studies of the left hand and wrist. Growth and development are appropriate for an individual's biologic age (skeletal age) rather than for their chronological age. Timing and tempo of growth and development are delayed in accordance with the biologic state of maturity.

Approximately 15% of patients with short stature referred for endocrinologic evaluation have CDGP. Individuals with CDGP and familial short stature represent another 23%. The frequency of CDGP may be underestimated because individuals with milder delays and those who are not psychologically stressed may not be seen by subspecialists. In a study of 555 (out of 80,000) schoolchildren below the third percentile in height for age with growth rates below normal (&lt;5&amp;nbsp;cm/y), twice as many boys as girls were affected. CDGP was found in 28% of boys and 24% of girls, and another 18% of boys and 16% of girls had familial short stature in combination with CDGP.

==Mortality/Morbidity==

CDGP is not associated with increased mortality because it is a variant of normal growth rather than a disease. However, in some affected individuals, it can be associated with significant psychological stress, resulting in poor self-image and social withdrawal. In recent years, researchers have also found that individuals with CDGP may be at increased risk for reduced bone mass in adulthood because of the delay in sex steroid influence on bone accrual during adolescence.

==Frequency==

Although the epidemiologic data indicate that all variants of normal growth are twice as common in boys as in girls, referrals for short stature reflect an even more divergent sex ratio. This likely reflects greater concern about males who are shorter than their peers or who have delayed sexual development.
No racial bias has been identified. Patterns of growth consistent with CDGP occur in infants as young as 3–6 months. However, individuals often do not seek medical attention until puberty, when lack of sexual development becomes a concern and discrepancy in height from peers is magnified by the delay in pubertal growth spurt.

==Clinical History==

Individuals with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) are usually of normal size at birth. Deceleration in both height and weight velocity typically occurs within the first 3–6 months of life. This shift downward is similar to that observed in infants experiencing normal lag-down growth but tends to be more severe and prolonged. Individual variation is substantial; however, most children resume a normal growth velocity by age 2–3 years. During childhood, these individuals grow along or parallel to the lower percentiles of the growth curve.

[[Skeletal age]], which is estimated from radiographic studies of the left hand and wrist, is usually delayed (typically 2-4 y by late childhood) and is most consistent with the child's height age (age for which a child's height is at the 50th percentile) rather than the child’s chronologic age. Because the timing of the onset of puberty, pubertal growth spurt, 
and epiphyseal fusion are determined by a child's skeletal age (biologic age), children with CDGP are often referred to as "'''late bloomers'''."
    
At the usual age for puberty, these children continue to grow at a prepubertal rate appropriate for their biologic stage of development. Natural slowing of linear growth just before onset of puberty may be exaggerated, emphasizing the difference in size from peers who are accelerating in growth. The timing of the pubertal growth spurt is delayed, and the spurt may be prolonged with a lower peak height velocity. In patients with both CDGP and familial short stature, the degree of growth retardation may appear more severe, but the adult height is appropriate for the genetic background.

==Physical==

Physical examination findings in patients with CDGP are essentially normal, with the exception of immature appearance for age. Body proportions may reflect the delay in growth. During childhood, the upper-to-lower body ratio may be greater than normal, reflecting more infantile proportions. In adults, the ratio is often reduced (i.e., &lt;1 in whites, &lt;0.9 in blacks) as a result of the longer period of leg (long bone) growth.

==Causes==

CDGP is thought to be inherited from '''multiple genes''' from both parents. The strong role of heredity is reflected in the 60-90% likelihood of this growth pattern in a family member of the same or opposite sex. A delay in the reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary pulse generator results in a later onset of puberty.

'''Cottonmouth''' is a fictional villain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Cottonmouth is a snake-themed super villain, mainly associated with the [[Serpent Society]]. He first appeared in ''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 1 #310 (October 1985), created by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and artist [[Paul Neary]]. Burchell Clemens was artificially enhanced and given the ability to extend his jaw to over a foot and bite through solid materials such as concrete. He first showed up as part of the [[Serpent Society]], often teaming up with Society member [[Asp (comics)|Asp]]. The team came into conflict with [[Captain America]] during a paid hit on [[MODOK]] After being arrested Society leader [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] freed Cottonmouth and others from custody. When [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] took control of the Serpent Society Cottonmouth was one of the members who opposed her, siding with Captain America to take Viper down. Cottonmouth remained a member when the Serpent Society was reorganized as Serpent Solutions.

==Fictional character biography==
Originally from [[Mobile, Alabama]], Cottonmouth was chosen by [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] to join a snake-themed villain group, the [[Serpent Society]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #310&lt;/ref&gt; With the ability to extend his jaws over a foot wide, he was given steel fangs, possibly by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]], which he uses to torture his victims in an almost [[cannibalistic]] way. His jaw muscles are superhumanly strong, and can bite with sufficient force to crush cinderblock or metals that are softer than iron. However, very little is known about his past, other than the fact that he was an active [[Crime|criminal]] in the southern portion of the [[United States]].

Cottonmouth was often paired up with [[Asp (comics)|Asp]], such as when the two were to advertise the Serpent Society to [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #311&lt;/ref&gt; The Serpent Society was hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] to hunt down [[MODOK]]. During their confrontation with MODOK, Cottonmouth and teammate [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]] were able to slay him, which was a big win for their organization. Cottonmouth also battled [[Captain America]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #312-313&lt;/ref&gt; They were soon defeated by Captain America, but were able to escape. He also participated in the mission to retrieve the retired [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]]'s costume, which turned out to be a trap by Captain America. Cottonmouth was injured during the battle, his teeth being destroyed by the star-spangled hero's shield. He, along with teammates [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]] and [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]] were eventually defeated and taken into custody. Not for long, however, as Sidewinder soon teleported them to safety.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #315&lt;/ref&gt; Cottonmouth and Rattler next confronted the Kingpin's men over Death Adder's murder.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #319&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]'s invasion, Cottonmouth sided with [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] and the other members who refused to take the leadership away from Sidewinder. He later betrayed Diamondback, attempting to bite her head off after she saved him, proving that his loyalties lied with Viper. He fought Steve Rogers as The Captain during this confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #341-342&lt;/ref&gt; Cottonmouth participated in the Serpent Society's mission to recover mystic objects for [[Ghaur]] and [[Llyra]], and battled [[Psylocke]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #13&lt;/ref&gt; He voted against Diamondback during the Serpent Society's trial against her. Alongside the Serpent Society, he combatted Captain America. [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], and Diamondback.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #380-382&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also battled other super-heroes such as [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Luke Cage]].&lt;ref&gt;''Black Panther'' #16-17&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually imprisoned, but escaped with Hawkeye, Plant-Man, and Headlok in [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #55-58, 60, 61, 63&lt;/ref&gt; He took [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|Bushmaster]]'s real name, Quincy McIver though his actual name has not been revealed.&lt;!--Note: Cottonmouth was referred to as Quincy McIver in Thunderbolts. This was most likely a continuity error on the part of the writer Fabian Nicieza.--&gt;

Cottonmouth was later tracked down by [[American Eagle (Marvel Comics)|American Eagle]] in Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;''American Eagle'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Several Serpent Society members including Anaconda, Black Mamba, Bushmaster and Cottonmouth, fought members of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in a semi-tropical locale. Cottonmouth was defeated by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #73&lt;/ref&gt;

Cottonmouth has been seen working with the Serpent Society on several occasions.  During an encounter with [[Deadpool]], Cottonmouth was shot in the skull.&lt;ref&gt;''Battle Scars'' #3-4&lt;/ref&gt;  He somehow recovered, as he was seen robbing a bank with the Society, where he was defeated by mutant [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Cottonmouth appears as a member of [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]]'s Serpent Society under its new name Serpent Solutions. He alongside Black Racer and Copperhead attacked [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]] and Diamondback where Captain America learned too late that Diamondback is a member of Serpent Solutions where she knocks him out and brings him to Serpent Solutions' headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the "[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]" storyline, Cottonmouth (along with Serpent Solutions) is recruited by [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]] to join his Army of Evil.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Due to bionic reconstruction, Cottonmouth possesses enhanced jaw and neck muscles, and steel teeth enabling him to bite with sufficient force to crush cinderblock or deform metals softer than iron, hang from a rope by his teeth for up to an hour, and to open his mouth larger than the size of a human head.

'''David Mark Berger''' (May 24, 1944 &amp;ndash; September 6, 1972) was an American and Israeli [[Olympic weightlifting|Olympic weightlifter]], and one of the eleven Israeli Olympians taken hostage and killed by the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] group [[Black September (group)|Black September]] during the [[Munich massacre]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. Born and raised in the United States, Berger was a lawyer by education and had emigrated to Israel after taking part in the [[1969 Maccabiah Games]].

==Early life and athletic success==
David Mark Berger was born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] on May 24, 1944. His mother was Dorothy Berger, (née Davidson), and his father was Benjamin Berger, who was a well known physician. A high school honors student as well as an athlete, Berger graduated from [[Shaker Heights High School]] in 1962. He attended [[Tulane University]] in New Orleans from 1962 to 1966 where he was an honors student. While studying at Tulane, he continued weightlifting training at the [[New Orleans Athletic Club]]. As a junior at Tulane, he won the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] weightlifting title in the 148-pound class. Berger earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in psychology from Tulane in 1966. He went on to enroll in a combined MBA-law degree program at [[Columbia University]] in New York, from which he graduated in 1969. While working toward his degrees, Berger continued to devote time to weightlifting, training at the McBurney [[YMCA]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. During his time in New York, Berger competed in the middleweight division. In 1968, competing as a middleweight, he finished fourth in the U.S. Olympic trials. His father, Benjamin, was once quoted as saying, "I used to tell him ‘You may not be the best weightlifter in the world, but you’re certainly the smartest!’"

After winning a gold medal in the middleweight weight-lifting contest in the [[1969 Maccabiah Games]], Berger [[Aliyah|emigrated to Israel]], intending to open a law office in [[Tel Aviv]] after completing his [[Israel Defense Forces|compulsory military service]]. Berger continued competing in weightlifting, but moved up in body weight to the lightheavy class. He won a [[silver medal]] at the [[1971 Asian Weightlifting Championships]], and achieved a long time dream when he was chosen to represent Israel as a member of the [[Israel at the Olympics|1972 Israeli Olympic team]]. In late August of that year, Berger flew to [[Munich]] with his teammates. On September 2, 1972, Berger competed, but was eliminated in an early round. He died in the Munich massacre four days later when [[Palestinian terrorists]] invaded the [[Olympic Village|Olympic village]] and held the Israeli team [[hostage]].

==Death ==
{{details|:Munich massacre}}
Early on the morning of September 5, 1972, [[Palestinian terrorist]]s took Berger and his five roommates hostage, after having earlier seized six officials in another apartment as well as wounding wrestling coach [[Moshe Weinberg]] in the face. While the athletes were being moved to the first apartment, Weinberg grappled with the intruders, allowing flyweight wrestler [[Gad Tsobari]] to escape but resulting in Weinberg’s death by gunfire. As the remaining hostages and terrorists entered the officials’ apartment, weightlifter [[Yossef Romano]] also attempted to overpower the intruders. Romano was cut nearly in half by automatic fire (his corpse was left all day at the feet of the hostages, who were tied to beds), and Berger was shot in his left shoulder, a wound seen by German officials later in the day. It is believed that Berger, being physically one of the largest of the hostages, was also beaten in order to intimidate the other hostages.

After all-day negotiations, the terrorists and their tied-up hostages were transferred from the Olympic Village via helicopter to [[Fürstenfeldbruck]] airbase outside of [[Munich]], where the terrorists believed they would be flown to a friendly Arab nation. Instead, the German border guards and Munich police attempted to ambush the terrorists and free the hostages. After a two-hour gunfight, one of the terrorists turned on the helicopter in which Berger was sitting and sprayed it with machine-gun fire. The other three hostages in the helicopter were killed instantly, but somehow Berger only received two non-lethal wounds in his legs. However, the terrorist then detonated a [[hand grenade]] inside the helicopter, causing a huge explosion and fire. An autopsy found that Berger had died of [[smoke inhalation]]. The five hostages in the other helicopter were all shot to death by another terrorist.

While the 10 other Israeli Olympians were flown to and buried in Israel, David Berger’s body was returned to the United States on an Air Force jet personally ordered by President [[Richard Nixon]]. Berger is buried at the [[Mayfield Cemetery]] in his hometown of Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Vigil|first=Vicki Blum|title=Cemeteries of Northeast Ohio: Stones, Symbols and Stories|location=Cleveland|publisher=Gray &amp; Co.|date=2007|isbn=9781598510256|pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6794">'''Eddie Bennett''' (1904 &amp;ndash; January 16, 1935) was an American [[batboy]] and [[mascot]] for several teams, most notably the [[New York Yankees]] during the 1920s and 1930s. At the time of his death, Bennett was considered to be the "most famous mascot in the world".&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IN9BAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-qkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5200,5375809&amp;dq=eddie+bennett&amp;hl=en|title=Smiling Eddie Bennett Mascot Who Helped Yankees To Three World Series Dead|last=Associated Press|date=January 18, 1935|work=The Telegraph Herald and Times-Journal|page=8|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bennett was born in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn]]. When Bennett was very young, he received a spine injury suffered in a [[baby carriage]] incident.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frommer|first=Harvey|title=Five O'Clock Lightning: Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, And The Greatest Baseball Team in History, The 1927 New York Yankees|year=2008|publisher=Wiley Publishing|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9780471778127|page=196|ref=Frommer}}&lt;!--|accessdate=April 22, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; That injury left Bennett with a [[hunchback]]ed back and restricted his growth, by the time he was an adult he was considered a dwarf.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; Bennett's parents died in the [[1918 flu epidemic]], and Bennett, needing a job, convinced [[Chicago White Sox]] outfielder [[Happy Felsch]] that he had "mystical powers" that could bring good luck to everyone that uses him.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; He became Felsch's personal mascot and when Felsch play improved, he moved on to become the White Sox personal mascot in 1919.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; The club won the pennant that year with Bennett sitting on the bench with the players. During the [[1919 World Series]], eight members of the White Sox, including Felsch decided to [[Black Sox scandal|throw the World Series]]. A scandal erupted which later led those eight players receiving lifetime bans from baseball and Bennett left the team to join his hometown [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Robins]].&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; The Robins won the pennant in [[1920 Brooklyn Robins season|1920]], but after participating in the &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Peter|title=Eddie Bennett|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/40572eaa|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; first three [[1920 World Series|World Series]] games both the second and third being Robins victories, Bennett wasn't invited to join the team at [[1920 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]].&lt;ref name="seldom"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5tImAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hgIGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2544,5221437&amp;dq=eddie-bennett&amp;hl=en|title=Mascots Seldom Stays in Baseball|last=Associated Press|date=February 14, 1932|work=The Sunday Morning Star|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Robins went on to lose their next four games, and the series to the Indians. He soon left the team citing "lack of trust".&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; 

==New York Yankees==
At the age of 18, Bennett became the bat boy for the New York Yankees on the request of Yankees owner [[Jacob Ruppert]]. He was considered to be a "good luck charm" by the members of the club, and became a well-known celebrity in New York.{{sfn|Frommer|2008|p=57|ps=none}} Each year, he went down to Florida to join the Yankees [[spring training]].&lt;ref name="seldom"/&gt; He became one of [[Babe Ruth]]'s closest friends on the team, and they played catch on the field nearly every game. A close confidant of manager [[Miller Huggins]], Bennett usually sat next to Huggins during Yankees games, pointing out issues he noticed on the field, a predecessor of a [[bench coach]] in today's baseball.{{sfn|Frommer|2008|p=69|ps=none}}

==Decline and death==
On May 19, 1932, Bennett was hit by a taxi on a New York City street. He suffered a broken leg and other injuries from which he never recovered. To find relief from the pain he suffered from the injuries, Bennett started to abuse alcohol.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; He was forced to retire as the Yankees mascot in the middle of 1933 season, although Ruppert insisted he remain on the payroll all year. ''The New York Times'' reported that the "notoriously superstitious" ballplayers and fans blamed Bennett's absence on the Yankees' failure to win the pennant in 1933 and 1934.&lt;ref name="tokens"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yankees' Mascot Dies Amid Tokens; Eddie Bennett Found in Room Surrounded by Baseballs, Bats and Players' Photos.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1935/01/17/93666674.html?pageNumber=42|accessdate=August 13, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=January 17, 1935|page=42|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1935, Bennett died penniless in his room at a lodging house at 115 W. 84th Street in Manhattan, age 31. The coroner ruled the cause of death as alcoholism; according to his landlady, Bennett had told her that drinking was the only relief from his chronic pain.&lt;ref name="tokens"/&gt; He had no known relatives and had been scheduled to be buried in a [[pauper's grave]] until Ruppert paid for his funeral and burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yankees to Bury Mascot; Club Officials to Attend Funeral Tomorrow for Eddie Bennett |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1935/01/18/93442094.html?pageNumber=25|accessdate=13 August 2017|work=The New York Times|date=January 18, 1935|page=25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruppert and general manager [[Ed Barrow]] were not able to attend the service but sent flowers.  The entire Yankee front office staff of [[Paul Krichell]], [[Gene McCann]], Mark Roth, George Perry, and Charlie McManus accompanied Bennett's body from the funeral parlor to [[St. Gregory the Great Church (Manhattan)|St. Gregory the Great Church]] for the service and on to [[St. John Cemetery (Queens)|St. John's Cemetery]] in Queens for burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Funeral Services for Eddie Bennett – Floral Tributes to Memory of Baseball Mascot Sent by Ruppert and Others|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1935/01/20/93442577.html?pageNumber=32|accessdate=August 13, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=January 20, 1935|page=32|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; No player attended the service despite being it being the off-season.{{sfn|Frommer|2008|p=197|ps=none}}

==Legacy==

Bennett's life was mentioned by billionaire [[Warren Buffett]] during his annual stockholder report in 2002, saying that Bennett was a key role model during Buffett's career in investing, naming him a "winner at every costs".{{sfn|Frommer|2008|p=197|ps=none}}

'''Edward Russell Ayrton''' (17 December 1882 – 18 May 1914) was an [[England|English]] [[Egyptologist]] and [[archaeologist]].

[[File:Edward Russell Ayrton.jpg|thumb|Edward Russell Ayrton.]]

He was the son of William Scrope Ayrton, 1849-1904 (a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] consular official in China) and his wife Ellen Louisa McClatchie, and was born in [[Wuhu City|Wuhu]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], on 17 December 1882 (coincidentally, the same year as the formation of the [[Egypt Exploration Fund]]). He was educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]], in [[London]].

He began his career in Egyptology at the age of 20, assisting the pioneer of systematic methodology in archaeology [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie]]. He joined Petrie on the Egypt Exploration Fund excavations at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] (which began in 1899) from 1902 to 1904.

Ayrton's first independent work was the excavation of the [[Second dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]] site of [[Shunet ez Zebib]] (at Abydos). Later, he worked near [[Abu Gorab|Ghurab]] with [[William Leonard Stevenson Loat]].

In 1904-05 he excavated and recorded graves of several ancient princesses found in the funerary temple complex of king [[Mentuhotep II]] at [[Deir al-Bahari]], as part of the expedition led by [[Édouard Naville]] and [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|Henry Hall]].

Working for [[Theodore M. Davis]] in [[Egypt]]'s [[Valley of the Kings]] from 1905 to 1908, he discovered the following tombs:

* [[KV47]] (of the pharaoh [[Siptah]], in 1905)
* [[KV55]] ([[Amarna Period]], interment problematic, in 1907)
* [[KV56]] (of a royal child, in 1908) and 
* [[KV57]] (of the pharaoh [[Horemheb]], in 1908).

He also led or participated in the excavation of the following tombs:

* [[KV2]], [[KV10]], [[KV46]], [[KV47]], [[KV48]], [[KV49]], [[KV50]], [[KV51]], [[KV52]], [[KV53]], [[KV54]], [[KV56]], [[KV57]], [[KV59]], and [[KV60]].

Again working with Loat, in 1908-09 he excavated amongst the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|Sixth Dynasty]] tombs at Abydos and also the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic]] cemetery at El Mahasna.

In 1911 he accepted a position with the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon. On the 18 May 1914 he drowned while on a shooting expedition, in an accident on the [[Tissa Tank]] lake, [[Tissamaharama]], in southern [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]). [[The Times|The Times Newspaper]] printed his obituary on the 23 May 1914; and his [[Probate#Probate administration|Probate Administration]] is during 1915. The Estate of £457 18s 1d is left to Florence Margaret Ayrton, Spinster.

'''Electromyography''' ('''EMG''') is an [[electrodiagnostic medicine]] technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by [[skeletal muscles]].&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;Kamen, Gary. Electromyographic Kinesiology. In Robertson, DGE et al. Research Methods in Biomechanics. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics Publ., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; EMG is performed using an [[medical instrument|instrument]] called an '''electromyograph''' to produce a record called an '''electromyogram'''. An electromyograph detects the [[electric potential]] generated by muscle [[cell (biology)|cell]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Electromyography}}&lt;/ref&gt; when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated. The signals can be analyzed to detect medical abnormalities, activation level, or recruitment order, or to analyze the [[biomechanics]] of human or animal movement.

==Medical uses==
EMG testing has a variety of clinical and biomedical applications.  EMG is used as a diagnostics tool for identifying [[neuromuscular diseases]], or as a research tool for studying [[kinesiology]], and disorders of motor control. EMG signals are sometimes used to guide [[Botox|botulinum toxin]] or phenol injections into muscles. EMG signals are also used as a control signal for [[prosthetic]] devices such as prosthetic hands, arms, and lower limbs.

An [[acceleromyograph]] may be used for [[neuromuscular monitoring]] in general anesthesia with [[neuromuscular-blocking drug]]s, in order to avoid [[postoperative residual curarization]] (PORC).&lt;ref&gt;Harvey AM, Masland RL: ''Actions of durarizing preparations in the human.'' Journal of Pharmacology And Experimental Therapeutics, Vol. 73, Issue 3, 304-311, 1941&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Botelho SY: ''Comparison of simultaneously recorded electrical and mechanical activity in myasthenia gravis patients and in partially curarized normal humans.'' Am J Med. 1955 Nov;19(5):693-6. {{PMID|13268466}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christie TH, Churchill-Davidson HC: ''The St. Thomas's Hospital nerve stimulator in the diagnosis of prolonged apnoea.'' Lancet. 1958 Apr 12;1(7024):776. {{PMID|13526270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engbaek J, Ostergaard D, Viby-Mogensen J: ''Double burst stimulation (DBS): a new pattern of nerve stimulation to identify residual neuromuscular block.'' Br J Anaesth. 1989 Mar;62(3):274-8. {{PMID|2522790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except in the case of some purely primary myopathic conditions EMG is usually performed with another [[electrodiagnostic medicine]] test that measures the conducting function of nerves. This is called [[nerve conduction studies]] (NCS).   Needle EMG and NCSs are typically indicated when there is pain in the limbs, weakness from spinal [[nerve compression]], or concern about some other neurologic injury or disorder.&lt;ref name="NASSfive"&gt;{{Citation |author1 = North American Spine Society |author1-link = North American Spine Society |date = February 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = North American Spine Society |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page =  |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/north-american-spine-society/ |accessdate = 25 March 2013 }}, which cites

Less common medical conditions include [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[myasthenia gravis]], and [[muscular dystrophy]].

== Technique ==

===Skin preparation and risks===
The first step before insertion of the needle electrode is skin preparation.  This typically involves simply cleaning the skin with an alcohol pad.

The actual placement of the needle electrode can be difficult and depends on a number of factors, such as specific muscle selection and the size of that muscle.  Proper needle EMG placement is very important for accurate representation of the [[muscle]] of interest, although EMG is more effective on superficial muscles as it is unable to bypass the action potentials of superficial muscles and detect deeper muscles.  Also, the more [[body fat]] an individual has, the weaker the EMG signal. When placing the EMG sensor, the ideal location is at the belly of the muscle: the longitudinal midline.  The belly of the muscle can also be thought of as in-between the motor point (middle) of the muscle and the tendonus insertion point.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.delsys.com/Attachments_pdf/TN101%20-%20EMG%20Sensor%20Placement-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardiac pacemakers and implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) are used increasingly in clinical practice, and no evidence exists indicating that performing routine electrodiagnostic studies on patients with these devices pose a safety hazard. However, there are theoretical concerns that electrical impulses of nerve conduction studies (NCS) could be erroneously sensed by devices and result in unintended inhibition or triggering of output or reprogramming of the device. In general, the closer the stimulation site is to the pacemaker and pacing leads, the greater the chance for inducing a voltage of sufficient amplitude to inhibit the pacemaker. Despite such concerns, no immediate or delayed adverse effects have been reported with routine NCS.&lt;ref name="aanem.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aanem.org/getmedia/2034191e-583b-4c55-b725-fc38ea8262e2/risksinEDX.pdf.aspx.|title=Not Found - American Association of Neuromuscular &amp; Electrodiagnostic Medicine|author=|date=|website=www.aanem.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No known contraindications exist for performing needle EMG or NCS on pregnant patients. Additionally, no complications from these procedures have been reported in the literature. Evoked potential testing, likewise, has not been reported to cause any problems when it is performed during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="aanem.org"/&gt;

Patients with lymphedema or patients at risk for lymphedema are routinely cautioned to avoid percutaneous procedures in the affected extremity, namely venipuncture, to prevent development or worsening of lymphedema or cellulitis. Despite the potential risk, the evidence for such complications subsequent to venipuncture is limited. No published reports exist of cellulitis, infection, or other complications related to EMG performed in the setting of lymphedema or prior lymph node dissection. However, given the unknown risk of cellulitis in patients with lymphedema,  reasonable caution should be exercised in performing needle examinations in lymphedematous regions to avoid complications. In patients with gross edema and taut skin, skin puncture by needle electrodes may result in chronic weeping of serous fluid. The potential bacterial media of such serous fluid and the violation of skin integrity may increase the risk of cellulitis. Before proceeding, the physician should weigh the potential risks of performing the study with the need to obtain the information gained.&lt;ref name="aanem.org"/&gt;

===Surface and intramuscular EMG recording electrodes===
There are two kinds of EMG: surface EMG and intramuscular EMG. Surface EMG assesses muscle function by recording muscle activity from the surface above the muscle on the skin. Surface electrodes are able to provide only a limited assessment of the muscle activity.  Surface EMG can be recorded by a pair of electrodes or by a more complex array of multiple electrodes.  More than one electrode is needed because EMG recordings display the potential difference (voltage difference) between two separate electrodes.  Limitations of this approach are the fact that surface electrode recordings are restricted to superficial muscles, are influenced by the depth of the subcutaneous tissue at the site of the recording which can be highly variable depending of the weight of a patient, and cannot reliably discriminate between the discharges of adjacent muscles.

Intramuscular EMG can be performed using a variety of different types of recording electrodes.  The simplest approach is a monopolar needle electrode. This can be a fine wire inserted into a muscle with a surface electrode as a reference; or two fine wires inserted into muscle referenced to each other.  Most commonly fine wire recordings are for research or kinesiology studies.  Diagnostic monopolar EMG electrodes are typically insulated and stiff enough to penetrate skin, with only the tip exposed using a surface electrode for reference. Needles for injecting therapeutic botulinum toxin or phenol are typically monopolar electrodes that use a surface reference, in this case, however, the metal shaft of a hypodermic needle, insulated so that only the tip is exposed, is used both to record signals and to inject.  Slightly more complex in design is the concentric needle electrode. These needles have a fine wire, embedded in a layer of insulation that fills the barrel of a hypodermic needle, that has an exposed shaft, and the shaft serves as the reference electrode. The exposed tip of the fine wire serves as the active electrode.  As a result of this configuration, signals tend to be smaller when recorded from a concentric electrode than when recorded from a monopolar electrode and they are more resistant to electrical artifacts from tissue and measurements tend to be somewhat more reliable.  However, because the shaft is exposed throughout its length, superficial muscle activity can contaminate the recording of deeper muscles.  Single fiber EMG needle electrodes are designed to have very tiny recording areas, and allow for the discharges of individual muscle fibers to be discriminated.

To perform intramuscular EMG, typically either a monopolar or concentric needle electrode  is inserted through the skin into the muscle tissue.  The needle is then moved to multiple spots within a relaxed muscle to evaluate both insertional activity and resting activity in the muscle.  Normal muscles exhibit a brief burst of muscle fiber activation when stimulated by needle movement, but this rarely lasts more than 100ms.  The two most common pathologic types of resting activity in muscle are fasciculation and fibrillation potentials.   A fasciculation potential is an involuntary activation of a [[motor unit]] within the muscle, sometimes visible with the naked eye as a muscle twitch or by surface electrodes.  Fibrillations, however, are only detected by needle EMG, and represent the isolated activation of individual muscle fibers, usually as the result of nerve or muscle disease.  Often, fibrillations are triggered by needle movement (insertional activity) and persist for several seconds or more after the movement ceases.

After assessing resting and insertional activity, the electromyographer assess the activity of muscle during voluntary contraction.  The shape, size, and frequency of the resulting electrical signals are judged. Then the electrode is retracted a few millimetres, and again the activity is analyzed. This is repeated, sometimes  until data on 10–20 motor units have been collected in order to draw conclusions about motor unit function.  Each electrode track gives only a very local picture of the activity of the whole muscle. Because skeletal muscles differ in the inner structure, the electrode has to be placed at various locations to obtain an accurate study.

Single fiber electromyography assesses the delay between the contractions of individual muscle fibers within a motor unit and is a sensitive test for dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction caused by drugs, poisons, or diseases such as myasthenia gravis.  The technique is complicated and typically only performed by individuals with special advanced training.  

Surface EMG is used in a number of settings; for example, in the physiotherapy clinic, muscle activation is monitored using surface EMG and patients have an auditory or visual stimulus to help them know when they are activating the muscle (biofeedback). A review of the literature on surface EMG published in 2008, concluded that surface EMG may be useful to detect the presence of neuromuscular disease (level C rating, class III data), but there are insufficient data to support its utility for distinguishing between neuropathic and myopathic conditions or for the diagnosis of specific neuromuscular diseases. EMGs may be useful for additional study of fatigue associated with post-poliomyelitis syndrome and electromechanical function in myotonic dystrophy (level C rating, class III data).&lt;ref name="aanem.org"/&gt;

Certain  US states limit the performance of needle EMG by nonphysicians. New Jersey declared that it cannot be delegated to a physician's assistant.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Rothman, MD, v. Selective Insurance Company of America, Supreme Court of New Jersey, Jan. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Texas Court of Appeals, Third District, at Austin, Cause No. 03-10-673-CV. April 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Michigan has passed legislation saying needle EMG is the practice of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Section 333.17018 Michigan Compiled Laws http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-333-17018&lt;/ref&gt; Special training in diagnosing medical diseases with EMG is required only in residency and fellowship programs in neurology, clinical neurophysiology, neuromuscular medicine, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.  There are certain subspecialists in otolaryngology who have had selective training in performing EMG of the laryngeal muscles, and subspecialists in urology, obstetrics and gynecology who have had selective training in performing EMG of muscles controlling bowel and bladder function.

===Maximal voluntary contraction===
One basic function of EMG is to see how well a muscle can be activated. The most common way that can be determined is by performing a [[muscle contraction|maximal voluntary contraction]] (MVC) of the muscle that is being tested.&lt;ref&gt;Behm, D.G., Whittle, J., Button, D.,  &amp; Power, K. (2002). Intermuscle differences in activation. Muscle and Nerve. 25(2); 236-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscle force, which is measured mechanically, typically correlates highly with measures of EMG activation of muscle.  Most commonly this is assessed with surface electrodes, but it should be recognized that these typically only record from muscle fibers in close approximation to the surface.

Several analytical methods for determining muscle activation are commonly used depending on the application. The use of mean EMG activation or the peak contraction value is a debated topic.  Most studies commonly use the [[muscle contraction|maximal voluntary contraction]] as a means of analyzing peak force and force generated by target muscles. According to the article, Peak and average rectified EMG measures: Which method of data reduction should be used for assessing core training exercises?,&lt;ref&gt;Hibbs, A.E., Thompson, K.G., French, D.N., Hodgson, D., Spears, I.R. Peak and average rectified EMG measures: 
Which method of data reduction should be used for assessing core training exercises? Journal of Electromyography 
and Kinesiology. 21(1), 102 – 111. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the “average rectified EMG data (ARV) is significantly less variable when measuring the muscle activity of the core musculature compared to the peak EMG variable.” Therefore, these researchers would suggest that “ARV EMG data should be recorded alongside the peak EMG measure when assessing core exercises.” Providing the reader with both sets of data would result in enhanced validity of the study and potentially eradicate the contradictions within the research.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, T. S., Lloyd, D. G., Manal, K., &amp; Besier, T. F. (2004). Neuromusculoskeletal modeling: estimation of muscle forces and joint moments and movements from measurements of neural command. Journal of applied biomechanics, 20(4), 367.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halperin, I., Aboodarda, S. J., Button, D. C., Andersen, L. L., &amp; Behm, D. G. (2014). ROLLER MASSAGER IMPROVES RANGE OF MOTION OF PLANTAR FLEXOR MUSCLES WITHOUT SUBSEQUENT DECREASES IN FORCE PARAMETERS. International journal of sports physical therapy, 9(1), 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other measurements===
EMG can also be used for indicating the amount of fatigue in a muscle.  The following changes in the EMG signal can signify [[muscle fatigue]]: an increase in the mean absolute value of the signal, increase in the [[amplitude]] and duration of the muscle action potential and an overall shift to lower frequencies.  Monitoring the changes of different frequency changes the most common way of using EMG to determine levels of fatigue.  The lower conduction velocities enable the slower [[motor neuron]]s to remain active.&lt;ref&gt;Cifrek, M., Medved, V., Tonković, S., &amp; Ostojić, S. (2009). Surface EMG based muscle fatigue evaluation in biomechanics. Clinical Biomechanics, 24(4), 327-340.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[motor unit]] is defined as one motor [[neuron]] and all of the [[muscle fibers]] it innervates. When a motor unit fires, the impulse (called an [[action potential]]) is carried down the motor neuron to the muscle. The area where the nerve contacts the muscle is called the [[neuromuscular junction]], or the [[motor end plate]]. After the action potential is transmitted across the neuromuscular junction, an action potential is elicited in all of the innervated muscle fibers of that particular motor unit. The sum of all this electrical activity is known as a motor unit action potential (MUAP). This electrophysiologic activity from multiple motor units is the signal typically evaluated during an EMG. The composition of the motor unit, the number of muscle fibres per motor unit, the metabolic type of muscle fibres and many other factors affect the shape of the motor unit potentials in the myogram.

[[Nerve conduction study|Nerve conduction testing]] is also often done at the same time as an EMG to diagnose neurological diseases.

Some patients can find the procedure somewhat painful, whereas others experience only a small amount of discomfort when the needle is inserted. The muscle or muscles being tested may be slightly sore for a day or two after the procedure.

=== EMG signal decomposition ===

EMG signals are essentially made up of superimposed motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) from several motor units. For a thorough analysis, the measured EMG signals can be [[Wavelet transform|decomposed]] into their constituent MUAPs. MUAPs from different motor units tend to have different characteristic shapes, while MUAPs recorded by the same electrode from the same motor unit are typically similar. Notably MUAP size and shape depend on where the electrode is located with respect to the fibers and so can appear to be different if the electrode moves position. EMG decomposition is non-trivial, although many methods have been proposed.

===EMG signal processing===
Rectification is the translation of the raw EMG signal to a signal with a single [[Electrical polarity|polarity]], usually positive. The purpose of rectifying the signal is to ensure the signal does not average to zero, due to the raw EMG signal having positive and negative components.  Two types of rectification are used: full-wave and half-wave rectification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Biol. Proced. Online |issue=8 |page=11–35 |date=Mar 23, 2006 |doi=10.1251/bpo115 |pmc=1455479 |pmid=16799694 |title=Techniques of EMG signal analysis: detection, processing, classification and applications |first1=M.B.I. |last1=Raez |first2=M.S. |last2=Hussain |first3=F. |last3=Mohd-Yasin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Full-wave rectification adds the EMG signal below the baseline to the signal above the baseline to make a conditioned signal that is all positive. If the baseline is zero, this is equivalent to taking the [[absolute value]] of the signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1992 |last1=Weir |first1=JP |last2=Wagner |first2=LL |last3=Housh |first3=TJ |title=Linearity and reliability of the IEMG v. torque relationship for the forearm flexors and leg extensors |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=283–287 |journal=American Journal of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1973 |last1=Vrendenbregt |first1=J |last2=Rau |first2=G |last3=Housh |title=Surface eletromyography in relation to force, muscle length and endurance. |pages=607–622 |journal=New developments in electromyography and clinical neurophysiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the preferred method of rectification because it conserves all of the signal energy for analysis.  Half-wave rectification discards the portion of the EMG signal that is below the baseline. In doing so, the average of the data is no longer zero therefore it can be used in statistical analyses.

=== Limitations ===
Needle EMG used in clinical settings has practical applications such as helping to discover disease. Needle EMG has limitations, however, in that it does involve voluntary activation of muscle, and as such is less informative in patients unwilling or unable to cooperate, children and infants, and in individuals with paralysis., Surface EMG can have limited applications due to inherent problems associated with surface EMG.  Adipose tissue (fat) can affect EMG recordings.  Studies show that as adipose tissue increased the active muscle directly below the surface decreased.  As adipose tissue increased, the amplitude of the surface EMG signal directly above the center of the active muscle decreased.  EMG signal recordings are typically more accurate with individuals who have lower body fat, and more compliant skin, such as young people when compared to old.  Muscle cross talk occurs when the EMG signal from one muscle interferes with that of another limiting reliability of the signal of the muscle being tested. Surface EMG is limited due to lack of deep muscles reliability.  Deep muscles require intramuscular wires that are intrusive and painful in order to achieve an EMG signal.  Surface EMG can only measure superficial muscles and even then it is hard to narrow down the signal to a single muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuiken|first=TA|author2=Lowery, Stoykob|title=The Effect of Subcutaneous Fat on myoelectric signal amplitude and cross talk|journal=Prosthetics and Orthodontics International|date=April 2003|volume=27|issue=1|pages=48–54|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrical characteristics ===
The electrical source is the muscle [[membrane potential]] of about &amp;ndash;90&amp;nbsp;mV.&lt;ref&gt;Nigg B.M., &amp; Herzog W., 1999. Biomechanics of the Musculo-Skeletal system. Wiley. Page:349.&lt;/ref&gt; Measured EMG potentials range between less than 50&amp;nbsp;μV and up to 30&amp;nbsp;mV, depending on the muscle under observation.

Typical repetition rate of muscle [[motor unit]] firing is about 7&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;Hz, depending on the size of the muscle (eye muscles versus seat (gluteal) muscles), previous axonal damage and other factors. Damage to motor units can be expected at ranges between 450 and 780&amp;nbsp;mV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patterson|first1=John R.|title=Fitwise|url=https://www.fitwise.com.au/|website=Castillo|publisher=Brian T.|accessdate=24 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Procedure outcomes==

=== Normal results ===
Muscle tissue at rest is normally electrically inactive. After the electrical activity caused by the irritation of needle insertion subsides, the electromyograph should detect no abnormal spontaneous activity (i.e., a muscle at rest should be electrically silent, with the exception of the area of the [[neuromuscular junction]], which is, under normal circumstances, very spontaneously active). When the muscle is voluntarily contracted, [[action potentials]] begin to appear. As the strength of the muscle contraction is increased, more and more muscle fibers produce action potentials.  When the muscle is fully contracted, there should appear a disorderly group of action potentials of varying rates and amplitudes (a complete recruitment and interference pattern).

=== Abnormal results ===
EMG findings vary with the type of disorder, the duration of the problem, the age of the patient, the degree to which the patient can be cooperative, the type of needle electrode used to study the patient, and sampling error in terms of the number of areas studied within a single muscle and the number of muscles studied overall.  Interpreting EMG findings is usually best done by an individual informed by a focused history and physical examination of the patient, and in conjunction with the results of other relevant diagnostic studies performed including most importantly, nerve conduction studies, but also, where appropriate, imaging studies such as MRI and ultrasound, muscle and nerve biopsy, muscle enzymes, and serologic studies.

== History ==
The first documented experiments dealing with EMG started with [[Francesco Redi]]’s works in 1666. Redi discovered a highly specialized muscle of the electric ray fish ([[Electric Eel]]) generated electricity. By 1773, Walsh had been able to demonstrate that the eel fish’s muscle tissue could generate a spark of electricity. In 1792, a publication entitled ''De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius'' appeared, written by [[Luigi Galvani]], in which the author demonstrated that electricity could initiate muscle contraction. Six decades later, in 1849, [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] discovered that it was also possible to record electrical activity during a voluntary muscle contraction. The first actual recording of this activity was made by [[Étienne-Jules Marey|Marey]] in 1890, who also introduced the term electromyography. In 1922, Gasser and [[Joseph Erlanger|Erlanger]] used an [[oscilloscope]] to show the electrical signals from muscles. Because of the stochastic nature of the myoelectric signal, only rough information could be obtained from its observation. The capability of detecting electromyographic signals improved steadily from the 1930s through the 1950s, and researchers began to use improved electrodes more widely for the study of muscles. The AANEM was formed in 1953 as one of several currently active medical societies with a special interest in advancing the science and clinical use of the technique.  Clinical use of surface EMG (sEMG) for the treatment of more specific disorders began in the 1960s. Hardyck and his researchers were the first (1966) practitioners to use sEMG. In the early 1980s, Cram and Steger introduced a clinical method for scanning a variety of muscles using an EMG sensing device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Cram | first1 = JR. | last2 = Steger | first2 = JC. | title = EMG scanning in the diagnosis of chronic pain. | journal = Biofeedback Self Regul | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–41 |date=Jun 1983 | doi =  | PMID = 6227339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the middle of the 1980s that integration techniques in electrodes had sufficiently advanced to allow batch production of the required small and lightweight instrumentation and amplifiers. At present, a number of suitable amplifiers are commercially available. In the early 1980s, cables that produced signals in the desired microvolt range became available. Recent research has resulted in a better understanding of the properties of surface EMG recording. Surface electromyography is increasingly used for recording from superficial muscles in clinical or [[kinesiology|kinesiological]] protocols, where intramuscular electrodes are used for investigating deep muscles or localized muscle activity.

There are many applications for the use of EMG. EMG is used clinically for the diagnosis of neurological and neuromuscular problems. It is used diagnostically by gait laboratories and by clinicians trained in the use of biofeedback or ergonomic assessment. EMG is also used in many types of research laboratories, including those involved in [[biomechanics]], motor control, neuromuscular physiology, movement disorders, postural control, and [[physical therapy]].

==Research==
EMG can be used to sense [[isometric exercise|isometric]] muscular activity where no movement is produced. This enables definition of a class of subtle motionless gestures to control interfaces without being noticed and without disrupting the surrounding environment.  These signals can be used to control a prosthesis or as a control signal for an electronic device such as a mobile phone or PDA {{CitationNeeded|date=February 2015}}.

EMG signals have been targeted as control for flight systems. The Human Senses Group at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] at [[Moffett Field]], CA seeks to advance man-machine interfaces by directly connecting a person to a computer.  In this project, an EMG signal is used to substitute for mechanical joysticks and keyboards.  EMG has also been used in research towards a "wearable cockpit," which employs EMG-based [[gestures]] to manipulate switches and control sticks necessary for flight in conjunction with a goggle-based display.

Unvoiced speech recognition recognizes speech by observing the EMG activity of muscles associated with speech. It is targeted for use in noisy environments, and may be helpful for people without [[vocal cords]] and people with [[aphasia]].

EMG has also been used as a control signal for computers and other devices.  An interface device based on EMG could be used to control moving objects, such as [[mobile robots]] or an [[electric wheelchair]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreasen, DS.; Gabbert DG,: EMG Switch Navigation of Power Wheelchairs, RESNA 2006. [http://www.tinkertron.com/Papers.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be helpful for individuals that cannot operate a joystick-controlled wheelchair.  Surface EMG recordings may also be a suitable control signal for some interactive video games.&lt;ref&gt;Park, DG.; Kim, HC. Muscleman: Wireless input device for a fighting action game based on the EMG signal and acceleration of the human forearm. [http://melab.snu.ac.kr/Research/melab/doc/HCI/muscleman_paper.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 an EMG program called Echidna was used to enable a man with locked in syndrome to send a message to a computer.  That program, now called NeuroSwitch, developed by Control Bionics enables people with severe disabilities to communicate by text, email, SMS, computer-generated voice and to control computer games and programs, and - through the internet - Anybots telepresence robots.

A joint project involving [[Microsoft]], the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], and the [[University of Toronto]] in [[Canada]] has explored using muscle signals from hand gestures as an interface device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/technology/091029-ttr-muscle-sensing.html |title=The Future of Video Game Input: Muscle Sensors |accessdate=2010-01-16 |last=Hsu |first=Jeremy |date=2009-10-29 |work=Live Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[patent]] based on this research was submitted on June 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220090327171%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20090327171&amp;RS=DN/20090327171 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112000900/http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220090327171%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN%2F20090327171&amp;RS=DN%2F20090327171 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-01-12 |title=Recognizing Gestures from Forearm EMG Signals |accessdate=2010-01-16 |date=2008-06-26 |publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Feldman served in [[Hong Kong]] for eight years, Taiwan for six, and Japan for four years. As a member of the Policy Planning Staff of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], he helped plan U.S. president [[Richard Nixon]]'s first [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit to China in 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.uscc.gov/bios/04_02_06bios/feldmanharvey%20.htm|publisher=United States–China Economic and Security Review Commission|title=Ambassador Harvey Feldman: Senior Fellow in China Policy, Asian Studies Center|date=2004-02-06|accessdate=2009-08-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807001020/http://www.uscc.gov/bios/04_02_06bios/feldmanharvey%20.htm|archivedate=2009-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued involvement with the process of relations with China when he became the Director of the Office of Republic of China Affairs in September 1977. In that capacity, he and Lee Marks began to draft the [[Taiwan Relations Act]] at the request of [[Richard Holbrooke]]; the act would be passed into law in 1979. He also created the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] which replaced the U.S. embassy in Taipei after relations were shifted to Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Taipei Times|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/04/09/201379|date=2003-04-09|accessdate=2009-08-19|title=Penning the future of Taiwan|last=Snyder|first=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, 1979, he was appointed to the position of U.S. ambassador to [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]], resident in [[Port Moresby]], the capital of PNG; he held that position until May 25, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/feldman-harvey-j|publisher=Office of the Historian, Department of State|location=United States|title=Harvey J.

He retired in 1986.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt;

==Retirement and death==
After his retirement, Feldman continued his involvement with China affairs. In 1989, he met with then-[[President of the Republic of China|ROC president]] [[Lee Teng-hui]] and advised him on potential strategies for helping the ROC to [[China and the United Nations|regain membership in the United Nations]].&lt;ref name="ChinaPost"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2007/09/07/121499/Former-United.htm|periodical=The ChinaPost|date=2007-09-07|accessdate=2009-08-19|title=Former U.S. official criticizes National Security Council for not recognizing Taiwan|last=Che|first=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, he became a fellow in China Policy of [[The Heritage Foundation]], a conservative think tank.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt; In 2007, he spoke out against remarks by [[United States National Security Council]] Senior Director for Asian Affairs Dennis Wilder stating that "Taiwan, or the Republic of China, is not at this point a state in the international community"; Feldman responded that U.S. government had no basis under law to oppose ROC membership in international bodies.&lt;ref name="ChinaPost"/&gt;

Outside of his China-related activities, Feldman was also a board member of the [[Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs]] and a partner in consultancy firm Global Business Access.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt; He died on February 24, 2009 at the age of 77 due to complications from [[aortic dissection]].

'''Jacquotte Delahaye''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1656), was a [[pirate]] active in the Caribbean sea. Alongside [[Anne Dieu-le-Veut]], she was one of very few 17th-century [[Women in piracy|female pirates]]. There is no evidence from period sources that Delahaye was a real person. Stories of her exploits are attributed to [[:fr:L%C3%A9on_Treich|Leon Treich]], a French fiction writer of the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Little-The Golden Age of Piracy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Little|first1=Benerson|title=The Golden Age of Piracy: The Truth Behind Pirate Myths|date=2016|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9781510713048|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2uIDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=15 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Delahaye reportedly came from [[Saint-Domingue]] in modern [[Haiti]], and was the daughter of a French father and a Haitian mother. Her mother is said to have died while giving birth to her brother, who suffered mild mental disability, and was left in her care after her father's death. According to legend and tradition, she became a pirate after the murder of her father.   

Jacquotte Delahaye is the subject of many legendary stories. To escape her pursuers, she faked her own death and took on a male alias, living as a man for many years. Upon her return, she became known as "back from the dead red" because of her striking red hair. 

She led a gang of hundreds of pirates, and with their help took over a small Caribbean island in the year of 1656, which was called a "freebooter republic".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SKgs8-pj4_YC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Jacquotte+Delahaye&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2bLuUq6KHKbpywPdsYLgCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Jacquotte%20Delahaye&amp;f=false Global Interactions in the Early Modern Age, 1400–1800. Charles H.

Charles H. Parker]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though no official documentation of any children exists, it was rumoured she had a daughter named Dinah Delahaye, who shared her mother's striking red hair, and who grew up to become a master swordswoman, and pirate commanding a small fleet of ships.

'''John Addison''' D.D. ([[floruit|fl.]] 1538), was an English [[Anglicanism#Anglican divines|divine]]. A native of the [[diocese of York]], he was admitted to a fellowship at [[Pembroke Hall]], [[Cambridge University]] in 1505, and graduated B.D. in 1519, and D.D. in 1523. He became chaplain to [[John Fisher]], [[bishop of Rochester]], and in the twenty-fifth year of the reign of [[Henry VIII]] he was [[attainted]] by parliament of misprision of treason for concealment of the pretended revelations of [[Elizabeth Barton]], the "Holy Maid of Kent", and it was enacted that he should lose his spiritual promotions from 20 March 1533–4.

Dr Addison superintended the publication of Bishop Fisher's ''Assertionis Lutheranæ Confutatio'', 1523, and had a grant from the king of the sole printing of it for three years. In about 1538 he wrote a book in support of the pope's supremacy over all bishops, to which a reply was made by [[Cuthbert Tunstal]], [[bishop of Durham]], and [[John Stokesly]], [[bishop of London]].

'''John Augustus Atkinson''' (c.1775–1830) was an English artist, engraver and watercolourist.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=848|first=Alan|last=Bird|title=Atkinson, John Augustus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Atkinson was born in [[London]]. In 1784, he went to [[St. Petersburg]] to his uncle [[James Walker (engraver)|James Walker]], engraver to the empress [[Catherine the Great]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William Young|last= Ottley|authorlink=William Young Ottley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKzjQ3NLkLMC&amp;pg=PT147|title=Notices of engravers and their works, the commencement of a dictionary which it is not intended to continue|year=1831|page=147}}(Walker is referred to variously as uncle, step father and father in law)&lt;/ref&gt; There he studied in the picture galleries, encouraged by Catherine and her son [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], and was commissioned by Paul to paint large pictures of Russian history.

In 1801, Atkinson returned to England, and in 1803 published ''A Picturesque Representation of the Manners, Customs, and Amusements of the Russians'', in 100 plates, drawn and etched by himself. He also painted in watercolours and in 1808 was elected to the [[Royal Watercolour Society|Society of Painters in Water Colours]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/oldwatercolourso00royauoft#page/n11/mode/2up/  The 'old' Water-Colour Society, 1804-1904 (1905)]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works, during the Napoleonic wars, were of naval subjects. He painted many battle scenes including a ''Battle of Waterloo'', which was engraved by [[John Burnet (painter)|John Burnet]].

His last contribution to the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition was in 1829. He died on 25 March 1830 in London.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; His will was dated 1830.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives Public Record Office - Probate Court of Canterbury&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir John Julius Wells''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|DL}} (30 March 1925 &amp;ndash; 8 February 2017) was a  [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician.

==Life before politics==
Wells was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]] (MA). He served in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] during the [[Second World War]], as a seaman in 1942, commissioned in 1943 and in submarines until 1946. He was a marine engineer, company director and farmer, and was a councillor on [[Leamington Spa]] Borough Council.

==Political career==
At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 general election]], Wells stood unsuccessfully in the [[Smethwick (UK Parliament constituency)|Smethwick constituency]]. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 general election]], he was elected as the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]], following in the footsteps of a 19th-century ancestor, also [[John Wells (19th-century politician)|John Wells]]. He held the safe Conservative seat until his retirement at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], when his successor was the future minister [[Ann Widdecombe]].

Throughout his period as a Member of Parliament, Wells was a strong supporter of country interests and the local economy, on one occasion riding his horse through the streets of Westminster and on another loudly eating a Kentish apple during a speech by a Labour Minister of Agriculture, as a protest against the import of cheap, subsidised and, in his opinion, inferior imports from France. He was appointed to the Speaker's Panel of Chairmen in 1974, becoming senior Chairman of Standing Committees in 1983 until his retirement. He became chairman of the Horticultural Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on Agriculture in 1968 and was Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Fruiterers]] in 1977. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1984 and appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Kent in 1992.

==Personal life==
He married in 1948, Lucinda, eldest daughter of Francis R Meath Baker, of Hasfield Court, Gloucestershire. In 1958 the family moved to Mere House in [[Mereworth]], Kent.&lt;ref name="mereworth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mere-house.co.uk/house/|title=The House|work=Mere House}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house had been built in the 18th century by [[Sir Francis Dashwood]], a distant ancestor of Lucinda.&lt;ref name="mereworth" /&gt; The Wells family have themselves had a long association with West Kent dating back to at least the 16th century, and were mentioned by [[Samuel Pepys]] in his famous diary as owners of a successful shipbuilders on the [[Thames]].&lt;ref name="mereworth" /&gt; Together the Wells's had two sons (W A Andrew, High Sheriff of Kent in 2005-6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highsheriffs.com/Association.htm|title=High Sheriff - The Association|work=highsheriffs.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oliver) and two daughters (the late Julia, Mrs James Luard, and Henrietta, homeopathic practitioner and author). Lady Wells died on 24 February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151002062250/http://www.mereworthpc.kentparishes.gov.uk/default.cfm?pid=minutes&amp;minutesid=3346 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Wells was a [[freemason]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Knicks–Nuggets brawl''' was an on-court altercation at a [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) game between the [[New York Knicks]] and [[Denver Nuggets]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] on Saturday, December 16, 2006. This altercation became the most penalized on-court fight in the NBA since the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] from two years before.

The fight began with a [[flagrant foul]] by Knicks [[shooting guard|guard]] [[Mardy Collins]] on Nuggets guard [[J. R. Smith]] in the closing seconds of the game. Several players joined in the confrontation, and began to make physical contact. The fight briefly spilled into the stands, and also stretched to the other end of the court. All ten players on the floor at the time were ejected after the altercation was finished. When suspensions were announced, seven [[List of players banned or suspended by the NBA|players were suspended]] without pay for a combined total of 47 games.

Although they were not penalized, Nuggets coach [[George Karl]] and Knicks coach [[Isiah Thomas]] were both scrutinized for their part in the brawl. [[Carmelo Anthony]] was also criticized for harming his image as a star, and several writers said the league had penalized the players excessively because it wanted to keep its image free from violence.

==Game recap==
Entering the game, the New York Knicks had a record of 9–17 while the Denver Nuggets sported a 13–9 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/teams/schedule?team=nyk&amp;year=2007 |title=New York Knicks Schedule - 2006-07 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/teams/schedule?team=den&amp;year=2007 |title=Denver Nuggets Schedule - 2006-07 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite trailing the entire game, the Knicks came as close as 2 points in the first half but the Nuggets regrouped and closed the half with a 13-point advantage and continued to lead in the second half by as much as 26 points in the third quarter. The Knicks briefly came within 10 points with ten minutes left in the game, but the Nuggets went on a 12–2 run and were never threatened again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=261216018 |title=Denver Nuggets vs. New York Knicks - Play By Play - December 16, 2006 |date=December 16, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmelo Anthony scored 24 [[point (basketball)|points]] to lead the Nuggets, and [[Marcus Camby]] added 24 points and 9 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]]; [[Stephon Marbury]] scored a season-high 31 points for the Knicks.&lt;ref name="espnrecap" /&gt;

===Altercation===
The incident occurred with 1:15 remaining in the Knicks' home game at [[Madison Square Garden]], where the Nuggets were leading 119–100. The Knicks' [[Mardy Collins]] fouled the Nuggets' [[J. R. Smith]] on a [[fast break]] by slapping his arms around Smith's neck, knocking him to the floor. As Smith stood up to confront Collins, [[Nate Robinson]] pulled  Smith away, and then began pushing and shouting at him. [[David Lee (basketball)|David Lee]] tried to hold Smith back, but Smith broke free and charged into Robinson, causing both players to fall into the photographers and front row courtside seats, before they were quickly separated by teammates.&lt;ref name="espnrecap"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=261216018 |title=Nuggets, Knicks in wild free-for-all; 10 players tossed |date=December 16, 2006 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the fighting was seemingly coming to an end, [[Carmelo Anthony]] confronted Collins and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. [[Jared Jeffries]] immediately tried to attack Anthony but tripped over [[Marcus Camby]], before being restrained by coaches and teammates, while Anthony backed up towards the Nuggets' bench. Collins also ran down the court to get at Anthony but was blocked by [[Nenê]] and Smith. All ten players on the court at the time of the incident were ejected by the officiating crew that consisted of [[Dick Bavetta]], [[Violet Palmer]], and [[Robbie Robinson (referee)|Robbie Robinson]].&lt;ref name="espnrecap"/&gt; No fans came onto the court during the entire ordeal, which prevented any repetition of the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] from 2 years ago.

NBA commissioner [[David Stern]] reacted with strict penalties for the players involved, stating, "It is our obligation to take the strongest possible steps to avoid such failures in the future." Seven players were suspended for a total of 47 games, and the players lost in excess of $1.2 million in salary. Each team was also fined $500,000.&lt;ref name="suspensions"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/news/Nuggets_Knicks_Suspensions.html |title=Nuggets-Knicks Suspensions |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2701228 |title=Suspensions total 47 games from Knicks-Nuggets fight |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Anthony's suspension was longer than 12 games, he was eligible to appeal to an arbitrator; however, Anthony eventually announced he would not attempt one, saying he did not "want to be a further distraction".&lt;ref name="wontappeal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2704934 |title=Anthony doesn't want to be distraction, won't appeal |last=Stein |first=Marc |date=December 22, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public reaction===
Several sportswriters said the brawl was not as violent as the [[Pacers–Pistons brawl]] two years before,&lt;ref name="plentyblame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/basketball/296541_miller20.html |title=Brawl fell far short of all the outrage |last=Miller |first=Ted |date=December 20, 2006 |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 81% of respondents in a [[SportsNation (Website)|SportsNation]] poll said the biggest difference between the two brawls was that it "didn't involve players going into the stands and fighting fans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/polling?event_id=2642&amp;action=1 |title=Vote: How long should 'Melo and Isiah be suspended? |date=December 17, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[MSNBC]]'s Michael Ventre said that the Knicks and Nuggets brawl was worse because "it was touched off by the actions of players, and it escalated because of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/16254683/ |title=Two years later, a brawl that's worse |last=Ventre |first=Michael |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=NBC Sports |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several writers said that the penalties were more severe because of the Pacers–Pistons brawl, because the league was on a "very serious image-cleanup campaign."&lt;ref name="hittinimage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rockylow" /&gt;

[[Steve Francis]] claimed that the media reaction to the fight and the suspensions itself were "racially motivated." He argued that [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[National Hockey League]] had "incidents that are way worse than basketball," but did not face the scrutiny that the NBA received "because there are more black players in the NBA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12192006/sports/knicks/knicks_francis__race_a_factor_knicks_dan_martin_and_marc_berman.htm |title=Knicks' Francis: Race a Factor |last=Martin |first=Dan |author2=Berman, Marc |date=December 19, 2006 |work=New York Post |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430094141/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12192006/sports/knicks/knicks_francis__race_a_factor_knicks_dan_martin_and_marc_berman.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was echoed by several writers, and sportswriter-television personality [[Michael Wilbon]] said that "NBA players have endured more scrutiny, pertaining to image, than any other professional athletes in America."&lt;ref name="plentyblame"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/16245553/ |title=Plenty of blame to go around for this brawl |last=Celizic |first=Mike |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=NBA Sports |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hittinimage" /&gt; [[Martin Luther King III]] called for a meeting to end the violence in the NBA, stating, "Individuals who play a game should be able to conduct themselves appropriately." However, the NBA said through a [[spokesman]] that they "don't think that meeting is necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&amp;sid=aNleXFcZzNb0&amp;refer=home |title=NBA Referees Invite League, Players to Meet on Fight |last=DiTore |first=Larry |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coaches' role in the brawl===
[[Image:Isiah Thomas.jpg|thumb|upright|Thomas came under scrutiny for his actions before the brawl.]]
Minutes before the brawl started, Knicks coach [[Isiah Thomas]] asked Carmelo Anthony not to go into the painted area around the basket, despite the fact that they were not members of the same team. Thomas later said that because Denver head coach [[George Karl]] kept his team's [[starting lineup|starting players]] on the court for the closing minutes of the game, which Thomas thought showed a lack of [[sportsmanship]], his orders to Anthony were to "show some class."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2700761 |title=Melo apologizes; Isiah reportedly under investigation |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Karl responded by saying the brawl "was directed by Isiah".&lt;ref name="thomasescape"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/business/manufacturing/feeds/ap/2006/12/18/ap3265869.html  |title=Column: Thomas Escapes Hands of Stern |last=Dahlberg |first=Tim |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=2009-04-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070108091047/http://www.forbes.com/business/manufacturing/feeds/ap/2006/12/18/ap3265869.html |archivedate = 2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas was not penalized after the brawl, as an NBA investigation ruled that they did not have "adequate evidence upon which to make a determination,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/sports/basketball/19isiah.html?fta=y |title=Lack of Evidence Lets Thomas Avoid Punishment |last=Beck |first=Howard |date=December 19, 2006 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but several writers criticized the NBA for not including Thomas in the suspensions.&lt;ref name="hittinimage"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/18/AR2006121801403.html |first=Michael |last=Wilbon |title=A Hittin' Image |date=December 19, 2006 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thomasescape"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigculprit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16269796 |title=Stern let biggest culprit in brawl off easy: Isiah |last=Celizic |first=Mike |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/481112p-404847c.html  |title=Blame Isiah for brawl |last=Lupica |first=Mike |date=December 18, 2006 |work=New York Daily News |accessdate=2009-04-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061222192642/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/481112p-404847c.html |archivedate = 2006-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sheridan |first=Chris |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/insider/columns/story?columnist=sheridan_chris&amp;id=2701751 |title=Not so Stern: Commish lets Isiah off the hook |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN analyst [[Marc Stein (reporter)|Marc Stein]] called Thomas' explanations of his comments "laughable,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;page=brawlquestions |title=Questions answered: Stern, Melo, Isiah and the brawl |last=Stein |first=Marc |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commentator [[Greg Anthony]], a former Knicks player, said he "never had a coach say that to an opponent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12202006/sports/knicks/not_so_tough_knicks_marc_berman.htm |title=Not so Tough |last=Berman |first=Marc |date=December 20, 2006 |work=New York Post |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226171845/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12202006/sports/knicks/not_so_tough_knicks_marc_berman.htm |archivedate=December 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that Thomas was attempting to resurrect the physical tactics of his former team, the [[Detroit Pistons#1980s|"Bad Boy" Pistons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116654838756654633 |title=Thomas May Be Only Winner In Wake of NBA's Latest Fight |last=Bialik |first=Carl |author2=Fry, Jason  |date=December 19, 2006 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;refer=columnist_soshnick&amp;sid=ap_76o7iBlVg |title=Thomas Has Knicks Fighting Phantoms |last=Soshnick |first=Scott |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Thomas saying that keeping the Nuggets starters on the floor in the final minutes of the game was unsportsmanlike, Karl said that he "never thought about running up the score," and only wanted to "get a big win on the road."&lt;ref name="karlescapes" /&gt; However, several sportswriters criticized his decision, and some said that he should also have been penalized.&lt;ref name="karlescapes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/19/sports/basketball/19araton.html?fta=y |title=As Thomas Takes Heat, Karl Escapes Scrutiny |last=Araton |first=Harvey |date=December 19, 2006 |work=New York Times |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earnedban"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12182006/sports/knicks/nuggets_karl_also_earned_ban_knicks_peter_vecsey.htm |title=Nuggets' Karl also earned ban |last=Vecsey |first=Peter |date=December 18, 2006 |work=New York Post |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122038/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12182006/sports/knicks/nuggets_karl_also_earned_ban_knicks_peter_vecsey.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sternreality"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/articles/2006/12/19/the_stern_reality____7_players_suspended/ |title=The Stern reality -- 7 players suspended |last=May |first=Peter |date=December 19, 2006 |work=Boston Globe |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that Karl was trying to humiliate Thomas due to the perception that Thomas had mistreated [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]], a friend of Karl's.&lt;ref name="bigculprit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="earnedban" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sternreality" /&gt; Karl was also blamed for putting his players in a position to start a fight.&lt;ref name="plentyblame" /&gt;&lt;ref name="earnedban" /&gt;

===Carmelo Anthony===
The day following the brawl, Anthony issued a statement and apology to his family, the league, and fans. He also specifically apologized to Mardy Collins, whom he directly struck during the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/nuggets/news/anthony_statement_061217.html |title=Statement from Carmelo Anthony |date=December 17, 2006 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the brawl, Anthony was the league's leading scorer;&lt;ref name="rockylow" /&gt; his suspension was also the longest of the players suspended, and the sixth-longest in NBA history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2006-12-18-brawl-suspensions_x.htm |title=NBA hands out penalties — Anthony suspended 15 games |last=Nance |first=Roscoe |date=December 19, 2006 |work=USA Today |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to former NBA player [[Steve Kerr]], Anthony had "tarnished" his image,&lt;ref name="rockylow"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=sk-carmelo121806&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Rocky Mountain low |last=Kerr |first=Steve |date=December 18, 2006 |publisher=Yahoo Sports |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and basketball analyst [[Ric Bucher]] said that Anthony had "torched his own career".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=stein_marc&amp;page=bucherfightview |title=Melo's walking a dangerous line again |last=Bucher |first=Ric |date=December 19, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sports Illustrated]] writer Marty Burns said that Anthony faced becoming known by sports fans across America as the player who punched Collins in the face and then ran away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/marty_burns/12/17/brawl.knicks.nuggets/ |title='Melo drama |last=Burns |first=Marty |date=December 17, 2006 |publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the backlash was [[Northwest Airlines]] pulling Anthony from its in-flight magazine cover, as it said it did not want "to condone the behavior of Anthony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2703887 |title=Airline doesn't want to condone brawl, pulls feature |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events after the brawl==
A day after Anthony was suspended, Denver acquired [[Allen Iverson]], who was then second in the league in scoring behind Anthony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2702501 |title=Miller, Smith go to Sixers in deal for Iverson |date=December 20, 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Anthony and Smith returned from their suspensions, the trio led the Nuggets to 45 wins and the sixth seed in the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] for the [[2007 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]].&lt;ref name="standings"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/standings?season=2007 |title=NBA Standings - 2006-2007 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were eliminated in the first round by the [[San Antonio Spurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DEN/2007.html |title=2006-07 Denver Nuggets Roster and Statistics |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Knicks finished 33–49, 12th in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], and did not make the playoffs.&lt;ref name="standings"/&gt;

The two teams faced each other for the first time since the altercation on November 17, 2007, which the Nuggets won 115–83. Opposing players [[Renaldo Balkman]] and [[Linas Kleiza]] began arguing with each other after Balkman was called for a hard foul on Kleiza, but the incident was defused after Balkman was given a [[technical foul]]. Iverson, Anthony, and [[Marcus Camby]] were all removed early in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=271117007 |title=Melo scores 24, Iverson adds 23 as Nuggets roll Knicks in Randolph's return |date=November 17, 2007 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balkman and Kleiza later became teammates&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basketballreference.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=DEN&amp;lg=n&amp;yr=2008 Denver Nuggets (1976 - ) 2008 Stats, History, Awards and More]&lt;/ref&gt; after Balkman was traded to the Nuggets in the 2008 off-season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3508429 Nuggets acquire Knicks' Balkman in trade package - NBA - ESPN]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the [[2010–11 NBA season|2010–11 season]], of the seven suspended players, three were still with their respective teams. [[Mardy Collins]] was traded to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/clippers/news/zrandolph_collins_081121.html |title=Clippers Acquire Zach Randolph and Mardy Collins From Knicks |date=November 21, 2008 |publisher=NBA |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome James]] was traded to the [[Chicago Bulls]] a year later, but never played for the Bulls as he suffered a torn Achilles tendon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3919012 |title=Knicks trade for Bulls' Hughes |date=February 19, 2009 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffries and Robinson were traded at the 2010 trade deadline to the [[Houston Rockets]] and [[Boston Celtics]], respectively. Robinson then signed a multi-year deal with the Denver Nuggets on July 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/nuggets/news/denver-nuggets-sign-free-agent-guard-nate-robinson |title= Denver Nuggets Sign Free-Agent Guard Nate Robinson |date=July 26, 2013 |publisher=NBA |accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carmelo Anthony]] was traded to the Knicks before the 2011 trade deadline. Meanwhile, Jeffries' contract was bought out by the Rockets and he rejoined the Knicks. In addition, [[J.R. Smith]] was signed by the Knicks in February of the 2012 season, which will make him the second former Nugget involved in the brawl to join the Knicks. Though not directly involved in the brawl, 2006 Nuggets C/PF [[Marcus Camby]] also joined the Knicks during the 2012 off-season, making him the third 2006 Nugget to join the Knicks for the 2012-2013 season.  Also not directly involved in the brawl, PF [[Kenyon Martin]] joined the Knicks on February 21, 2013 (initially on a 10-day contract), making him the 4th member of the 2012-2013 Knicks to have been on the '06 Nuggets team.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6970">This is a list of people claimed to be [[immortality|immortal]]. This list does not reference purely spiritual entities ([[spirit]]s, [[deity|gods]], [[demon]]s, [[angel]]s), non-humans ([[monster]]s, [[extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]]s, [[elf|elves]]), or artificial life ([[artificial intelligence]], [[robot]]s).

This list comprises people claimed to achieve a deathless existence on Earth.  This list does not contain those people who are supposed to have attained immortality through the typical means of a religion, such as a [[Christian]] in [[Heaven]].  It also does not include people whose immortality involves living in a place not on Earth, such as [[Heracles]] on [[Mount Olympus]]&lt;ref&gt;While Mount Olympus actually exists, the Greeks understood a distinction between the Olympus of the Gods and the part that could be seen by humans. See {{citation | last=Dudley | first=John | year=1846 | title=Naology: or, A treatise on the origin, progress, and symbolical import of the sacred structures of the most eminent nations and ages of the world | publisher=F. and J. Rivington | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHAAAAAAMAAJ | page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Eight Immortals]] of [[Taoism]] in [[Mount Penglai]].  It also does not include people who, according to their religion, became deities or actually were deities the whole time, such as [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] (who as part of the [[Trinity]] was, according to Christianity, also [[God in Christianity|God]]) or [[Parashurama]] according to [[Hindu]] mythology. &lt;!--in [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Mount Meru]]--&gt;

These listings are in chronological order, though some dates are approximate.

* Nicolas Flamel. He is believed to find the book of Abraham the mage, get the ever-changing text decoded and find a spell for immortality, along with his wife.

* [[Ziusudra]] (also Zi-ud-sura and Zin-Suddu; Hellenized Xisuthros: "found long life" or "life of long days") of Shuruppak is listed in the WB-62 Sumerian king list{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} recension as the last king of Sumer prior to the deluge. He is subsequently recorded as the hero of the Sumerian flood epic. He is also mentioned in other ancient literature, including The Death of Gilgamesh{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and The Poem of Early Rulers,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and a late version of The Instructions of Shuruppak refers to Ziusudra. [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Atrahasis]] ("extremely wise") and [[Utnapishtim]] ("he found life"), as well as biblical [[Noah]] ("rest") are similar heroes of [[flood legend]]s of the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Transliteration from "The Flood Tablet" Tablet 256/Block 7 in The British Museum: ti digir-gin7 mu-un-na-sum-mu | zi da-ri2 digir-gin7 mu-un&lt;na&gt;-ab-e11-de3 (They brought down to him eternal life. Like that of a God). The Primeval Flood Catastrophe: Origins and Early Development in Mesopotamian Traditions - Y.S. Chen Page 244&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ashwatthama|Ashwathama]] the [[Kaurava]] warrior after the  [[Kurukshetra War|kurukshetra]] was cursed by [[Krishna]] 'to be immortal and roam the earth without love, respect and social acceptance from anyone until the end of time'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://haribhakt.com/aswathama-existed-ashwathama-seen-by-people-ashwathama-is-alive/|title=Aswathama Exists – Ashwathama Seen By People – Ashwathama Is Alive {{!}} Radhe Radhe {{!}} HariBhakt.com|website=haribhakt.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sage [[Markandeya]], who was granted immortality at the age of sixteen.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Tithonus]], who in [[Greek mythology]] was granted eternal life but not eternal youth.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Achilles]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], [[Menelaus]], and [[Peleus]], were said to have achieved physical immortality through the intervention of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dag Øistein Endsjø]]. ''Greek Resurrection Beliefs and the Success of Christianity.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Wandering Jew]] (b. 1st century BC), a Jewish shoemaker.  According to legend, he taunted Jesus on his way to [[crucifixion]]. Jesus cursed him to "go on forever till I return." Thus, the Wandering Jew is to live until the [[Second Coming|second coming of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/filologie/hebra/2-5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John the Apostle]] (AD 6-101), one of Jesus's followers.  Some [[Mormons]], in conjunction with their own scriptures, interpret the biblical scripture found at John 21:21-23 to mean that John will ''tarry'' or remain on the earth until the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref&gt;The Immortal by JJ Dewey&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Three Nephites]] (between AD 34 and 35), three men described in the [[Book of Mormon]] who are given power over death in order to fulfill their desire to minister among men until Jesus comes again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/3_ne/28 3 Nephi 28&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Galahad|Sir Galahad]] (dates for his life fall between the 2nd century and the 6th century), one of the three [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian]] knights to find the [[Holy Grail]].  Of them, Galahad is the only one to have achieved immortality by it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Merlin]] (dates for his life fall between the 2nd century and the 6th century); in some accounts, Merlin is trapped by an [[Incantation|enchantment]] by [[Nimue]], and while some end with Merlin dying, in others he remains in the trap (variously a tomb, a cave, a mist, or a tree) indefinitely.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], the world's first murder, cursed with immortality for his crime
* [[Matiu Turipa]] , (dates his life in 18th century) Was Cursed to live forever, To never pass on by the Maori God's at the age of 20, for his betrayal of his people.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Failed quests for immortality==
* [[Gilgamesh]] (possibly reigned during the [[26th century BC]]) after the death of his companion, [[Enkidu]], Gilgamesh pursues immortality to avoid Enkidu's fate. Gilgamesh fails two tests and does not become immortal, realising instead that mortals attain immortality through lasting works of civilization and [[culture]].  [[Epic of Gilgamesh|Gilgamesh's story]] is among the [[ancient literature|oldest stories recorded]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}
* [[Qin Shi Huang]], the First [[Emperor of China]] who reigned during 259 BC–210 BC, also sought immortality in his old age. Twice he sent hundreds of people under the direction of [[Xu Fu]] to find the legendary [[elixir of life]], but failed. He died of [[mercury poisoning]] after he had eaten too many mercury pills, prescribed by his court doctors to make him immortal.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Around 100 people were arrested at the protest.

==Reactions==
[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, "I deplore the murder of Mayada Ashraf, killed while carrying out her professional duty to inform the public " the Director-General said. "I count on the government to do everything possible to shed light on this crime and bring the authors to justice.  Journalists must be able to do their job without fearing for their lives. This is key for upholding the right to freedom of expression, one of the pillars of democratic society."&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-director-general-condemns-murder-egyptian-journalist-mayada-ashraf?language=en|title=UNESCO Director-General condemns murder of Egyptian journalist Mayada Ashraf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reporters Without Borders]] released a statement, "We offer our heartfelt condolences to Ashraf's family and colleagues and we urge the competent authorities to carry out an independent and impartial investigation to ensure that this crime does not go unpunished."&lt;ref name=rsf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsf.org/en/news/female-reporter-shot-dead-while-covering-anti-sisi-protest|title=Female reporter shot dead while covering anti-Sisi protest|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|date=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Boumelha, president of [[International Federation of Journalists]], said, "This is not about the political blame game or settling political scores, it is about ensuring that press freedom is upheld and making sure that the perpetrators of this brutal murder face the full weight of justice for their crime."&lt;ref name=ifj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifj.org/nc/news-single-view/category/news/article/ifj-demands-thorough-and-impartial-investigation-into-murder-of-egyptian-journalist/|title=IFJ Demands Thorough and impartial Investigation Into Murder of Egyptian Journalist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nada Rashwan, an Egyptian journalist, said, "It's frightening on more than one level, the indiscriminate force used in quelling protests, the manipulation of the truth by the shamelessly biased media, and how people have been desensitized by the repetition of violent scenes. The brutal murder of a young woman in broad daylight does not seem to shock anyone."&lt;ref name=vice /&gt;

'''ND4S''' is a free, [[Open-source software|open-source]] extension of the [[Scala (programming language)|Scala programming language]] operating on the [[JVM|Java Virtual Machine]] – though it is compatible with both [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Clojure (programming language)|Clojure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Website|url=http://nd4j.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ND4S is a scientific [[Library (computing)|computing library]] for [[linear algebra]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] manipulation in a production environment, integrating with [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] and [[Apache Spark|Spark]] to work with distributed [[Graphics processing unit|GPUs]]. It supports n-dimensional arrays for [[List of JVM languages|JVM-based languages]].

ND4S has primarily been developed by the group in San Francisco that built [[Deeplearning4j]], led by Adam Gibson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Github Repository|url=https://github.com/deeplearning4j/nd4s}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created under an [[Apache Software Foundation]] license.

==Distributed==
ND4S's operations include [[Distributed computing|distributed]] [[Parallel computing|parallel]] versions. They can take place in a [[Computer cluster|cluster]] and process massive amounts of data. Matrix manipulation occurs in parallel on GPUs or CPUs in the cloud, and can work within Spark or Hadoop clusters.

==Benchmarks==
Benchmarks show that ND4S runs roughly twice as fast as [[NumPy]] on large matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ND4J Benchmarks|url=http://nd4j.org/benchmarking}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}

'''Neurodegeneration''' is the progressive loss of structure or function of [[neurons]], including death of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases – including [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[Huntington's disease]] – occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes. Such diseases are incurable, resulting in progressive degeneration and/or death of neuron cells.&lt;ref name=JPND&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Neurodegenerative Disease?|url=http://www.neurodegenerationresearch.eu/about/what/|website=JPND Research|publisher=JPND Research|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As research progresses, many similarities appear that relate these diseases to one another on a [[sub-cellular]] level. Discovering these similarities offers hope for therapeutic advances that could ameliorate many diseases simultaneously. There are many parallels between different neurodegenerative disorders including atypical protein assemblies as well as induced cell death.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Rubinsztein DC| title = The roles of intracellular protein-degradation pathways in neurodegeneration| journal = Nature| volume = 443| issue = 7113| pages = 780–6|date=October 2006| pmid = 17051204| doi = 10.1038/nature05291| bibcode=2006Natur.443..780R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bredesen&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bredesen DE, Rao RV, Mehlen P | title = Cell death in the nervous system| journal = Nature| volume = 443| issue = 7113| pages = 796–802|date=October 2006| pmid = 17051206| doi = 10.1038/nature05293| bibcode=2006Natur.443..796B| pmc=3970704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurodegeneration can be found in many different levels of neuronal circuitry ranging from molecular to systemic.

==Risk factor==
The greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases is [[ageing|aging]]. [[Free-radical theory of aging#Mitochondrial theory of aging|Mitochondrial DNA mutations]] as well as [[oxidative stress]] both contribute to aging.&lt;ref name = lin /&gt; Many of these diseases are late-onset, meaning there is some factor that changes as a person ages for each disease.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt; One constant factor is that in each disease, neurons gradually lose function as the disease progresses with age. It has been proposed that [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] accumulation provides the underlying causative link between [[ageing|aging]] and neurodegenerative disease.&lt;ref name= Bernsteinbook&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H.

==Mechanisms==

===Genetics===
{{see also|Epigenetics of neurodegenerative diseases}}
Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by [[genetic mutation]]s, most of which are located in completely unrelated genes. In many of the different diseases, the mutated gene has a common feature: a repeat of the CAG nucleotide triplet. CAG encodes for the amino acid [[glutamine]]. A repeat of CAG results in a [[polyglutamine tract|polyglutamine (polyQ) tract]]. Diseases showing this are known as [[polyglutamine disease]]s.&lt;ref name = thompson&gt;{{cite journal| author = Thompson LM| title = Neurodegeneration: a question of balance| journal = Nature| volume = 452| issue = 7188| pages = 707–8|date=April 2008| pmid = 18401401| doi = 10.1038/452707a|bibcode = 2008Natur.452..707T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = marsh&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Marsh JL, Lukacsovich T, Thompson LM | title = Animal Models of Polyglutamine Diseases and Therapeutic Approaches| journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume = 284| issue = 12| pages = 7431–5|date=March 2009| pmid = 18957429| doi = 10.1074/jbc.R800065200| pmc = 2658038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Polyglutamine:''' A repeat in this causes dominant pathogenesis. Extra glutamine residues can acquire toxic properties through a variety of ways, including irregular protein folding and degradation pathways, altered subcellular localization, and abnormal interactions with other cellular proteins.&lt;ref name = thompson /&gt; PolyQ studies often use a variety of animal models because there is such a clearly defined trigger – repeat expansion. Extensive research has been done using the [[model organism|models]] of [[nematode]] (''C. elegans''), and fruit fly (''Drosophila''), mice, and non-human primates. Mammalian data is often needed for FDA approval of drugs, which means that the bulk of the research is done using mice. Using data from the other animals (''C. elegans'' and ''Drosophila'' primarily) is often a precursor to finding the equivalent mammalian gene.&lt;ref name = marsh /&gt;&lt;ref name = orr&gt;{{cite journal| author = Orr HT| title = Unstable Nucleotide Repeat Minireview Series: A Molecular Biography of Unstable Repeat Disorders| journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume = 284| issue = 12| pages = 7405|date=March 2009| pmid = 18957428| doi = 10.1074/jbc.R800067200| pmc = 2658033}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Nine inherited neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the expansion of the CAG trinucleotide and polyQ tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zoghbi HY, Orr HT | title = Pathogenic Mechanisms of a Polyglutamine-mediated Neurodegenerative Disease, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1| journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume = 284| issue = 12| pages = 7425–9|date=March 2009| pmid = 18957430| doi = 10.1074/jbc.R800041200| pmc = 2658037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples are [[Huntington's disease]] and the [[spinocerebellar ataxia]]s. For a complete list, see the table under '''Polyglutamine (PolyQ) Diseases''' in the article [[Trinucleotide repeat disorder]]. While polyglutamine-repeat diseases encompass many different neurodegenerative disorders, there are many more it does not apply to. The genetics behind each disease are different and often unknown.

===Protein misfolding===
Several neurodegenerative diseases are classified as [[proteopathy|proteopathies]] as they are associated with the [[protein aggregation|aggregation]] of [[protein folding|misfolded proteins]].
*'''[[alpha-synuclein]]:''' can aggregate to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by [[Lewy bodies]], such as Parkinson's disease, [[dementia with Lewy bodies]], and multiple system atrophy. Alpha-synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils. In addition, an alpha-synuclein fragment, known as the non-Abeta component (NAC), is found in amyloid plaques in [[Alzheimer's disease]].
*'''tau:''' hyperphosphorylated [[tau protein]] is the main component of [[neurofibrillary tangles]] in Alzheimer's disease.
*'''[[beta amyloid]]:''' the major component of [[senile plaques]] in Alzheimer's disease.
*'''[[prion]]:''' main component of prion diseases and [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]].

===Intracellular mechanisms===

====Protein degradation pathways====
[[Parkinson's]] disease and [[Huntington's]] disease are both late-onset and associated with the accumulation of intracellular toxic proteins. Diseases caused by the aggregation of proteins are known as proteinopathies, and they are primarily caused by aggregates in the following structures:&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;

* cytosol, e.g. [[Parkinson's]] &amp; [[Huntington's]]
* nucleus, e.g. [[Spinocerebellar ataxia]] type 1 (SCA1)
* endoplasmic reticulum (ER), (as seen with neuroserpin mutations that cause familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies)
* extracellularly excreted proteins, amyloid-β in Alzheimer's disease

There are two main avenues eukaryotic cells use to remove troublesome proteins or organelles:

*'''ubiquitin–proteasome:''' protein [[ubiquitin]] along with enzymes is key for the degradation of many proteins that cause proteinopathies including polyQ expansions and alpha-synucleins. Research indicates proteasome enzymes may not be able to correctly cleave these irregular proteins, which could possibly result in a more toxic species. This is the primary route cells use to degrade proteins.&lt;ref name ="rubinsztein"/&gt;
** Decreased proteasome activity is consistent with models in which intracellular protein aggregates form. It is still unknown whether or not these aggregates are a cause or a result of neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;
*'''autophagy–lysosome pathways:''' a form of [[programmed cell death]] (PCD), this becomes the favorable route when a protein is aggregate-prone meaning it is a poor proteasome substrate. This can be split into two forms of autophagy: '''[[macroautophagy]]''' and '''chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)'''.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;
**'''macroautophagy''' is involved with nutrient recycling of macromolecules under conditions of starvation, certain apoptotic pathways, and if absent, leads to the formation of ubiquinated inclusions. Experiments in mice with neuronally confined macroautophagy-gene knockouts develop intraneuronal aggregates leading to neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name ="rubinsztein"/&gt;
**'''chaperone-mediated autophagy''' defects may also lead to neurodegeneration. Research has shown that mutant proteins bind to the CMA-pathway receptors on lysosomal membrane and in doing so block their own degradation as well as the degradation of other substrates.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;

====Membrane damage====
Damage to the membranes of organelles by monomeric or oligomeric proteins could also contribute to these diseases. Alpha-synuclein can damage membranes by inducing membrane curvature,&lt;ref name=curvature&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Varkey J, Isas JM, Mizuno N, etal |title=Membrane curvature induction and tubulation are common features of synucleins and apolipoproteins |journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=285 |issue=42 |pages=32486–93 |date=October 2010  |pmid=20693280 |pmc=2952250 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M110.139576}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cause extensive tubulation and vesiculation when incubated with artificial phospholipid vesicles.&lt;ref name=curvature/&gt;
[http://www.jbc.org/content/287/35/29301.long The tubes formed from these lipid vesicles consist of both micellar as well as bilayer tubes. Extensive induction of membrane curvature is deleterious  to the cell and would eventually lead to cell death.][http://www.jbc.org/content/288/24/17620.long Apart from tubular structures, alpha-synuclein can also form lipoprotein nanoparticles similar to apolipoproteins.]

====Mitochondrial dysfunction====
The most common form of cell death in neurodegeneration is through the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This pathway controls the activation of caspase-9 by regulating the release of [[cytochrome c]] from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). [[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) are normal byproducts of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. ROS concentration is mediated by mitochondrial antioxidants such as manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and [[glutathione peroxidase]]. Over production of ROS ([[oxidative stress]]) is a central feature of all neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to the generation of ROS, mitochondria are also involved with life-sustaining functions including calcium homeostasis, PCD, [[mitochondrial fission]] and [[mitochondrial fusion|fusion]], lipid concentration of the mitochondrial membranes, and the mitochondrial permeability transition. Mitochondrial disease leading to neurodegeneration is likely, at least on some level, to involve all of these functions.&lt;ref name = dimauro&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=DiMauro S, Schon EA | title = Mitochondrial disorders in the nervous system| journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience| volume = 31| issue = | pages = 91–123| year = 2008| pmid = 18333761| doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.30.051606.094302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play a causal role in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis, including in four of the more well known diseases [[Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Huntington's]], and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].&lt;ref name = lin&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lin MT, Beal MF | title = Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases| journal = Nature| volume = 443| issue = 7113| pages = 787–95|date=October 2006| pmid = 17051205| doi = 10.1038/nature05292|bibcode = 2006Natur.443..787L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neuron]]s are particularly vulnerable to [[oxidative stress|oxidative damage]] due to their strong metabolic activity associated with high [[transcription (biology)|transcription]] levels, high oxygen consumption, and weak [[antioxidant]] defense.&lt;ref name="pmid28785371"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu Z, Zhou T, Ziegler AC, Dimitrion P, Zuo L |title=Oxidative Stress in Neurodegenerative Diseases: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Applications |journal=Oxid Med Cell Longev |volume=2017 |issue= |pages=2525967 |date=2017 |pmid=28785371 |pmc=5529664 |doi=10.1155/2017/2525967 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27663141"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang H, Dharmalingam P, Vasquez V, Mitra J, Boldogh I, Rao KS, Kent TA, Mitra S, Hegde ML |title=Chronic oxidative damage together with genome repair deficiency in the neurons is a double whammy for neurodegeneration: Is damage response signaling a potential therapeutic target? |journal=Mech.

====DNA Damage====

The brain metabolizes as much as a fifth of consumed oxygen, and [[reactive oxygen species]] produced by oxidative metabolism are a major source of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] in the [[brain]].  Damage to a cell’s [[DNA]] is particularly harmful because DNA is the blueprint for protein production and unlike other molecules it cannot simply be replaced by re-synthesis. The vulnerability of post-mitotic neurons to DNA damage (such as oxidative lesions or certain types of DNA strand breaks), coupled with a gradual decline in the activities of [[DNA repair|repair mechanisms]], could lead to accumulation of DNA damage with age and contribute to brain aging and neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name="pmid25033177"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Madabhushi R, Pan L, Tsai LH |title=DNA damage and its links to neurodegeneration |journal=Neuron |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=266–282 |date=July 2014 |pmid=25033177 |pmc=5564444 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2014.06.034 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA single-strand breaks are common and are associated with the neurodegenerative disease ataxia-[[oculomotor apraxia]].&lt;ref name="pmid21550379"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeppesen DK, Bohr VA, Stevnsner T |title=DNA repair deficiency in neurodegeneration |journal=Prog.

====Axonal transport====
Axonal swelling and spheroids have been observed in many different neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests that defective axons are not only present in diseased neurons, but also that they may cause certain pathological insult due to accumulation of organelles. Axonal transport can be disrupted by a variety of mechanisms including damage to: [[kinesin]] and [[cytoplasmic dynein]], [[microtubules]], cargoes, and [[mitochondria]].&lt;ref name = devos&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=De Vos KJ, Grierson AJ, Ackerley S, Miller CC | title = Role of axonal transport in neurodegenerative diseases| journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience| volume = 31| issue = | pages = 151–73| year = 2008| pmid = 18558852| doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.061307.090711}}&lt;/ref&gt; When axonal transport is severely disrupted a degenerative pathway known as [[Wallerian degeneration|Wallerian-like degeneration]] is often triggered.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman MP &amp; Freeman MF 'Wallerian degeneration, WldS and Nmnat' Annual Review of Neuroscience 2010, 33: 245-67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programmed cell death===
[[Programmed cell death]] ('''PCD''') is death of a [[cell (biology)|cell]] in any form, mediated by an intracellular program.&lt;ref name = engelberg&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Engelberg-Kulka H, Amitai S, Kolodkin-Gal I, Hazan R | title = Bacterial Programmed Cell Death and Multicellular Behavior in Bacteria| journal = PLoS Genetics| volume = 2| issue = 10| pages = e135|date=October 2006| pmid = 17069462| pmc = 1626106| doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can be activated in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, amytrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease.&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vila|first1=Miquel|last2=Przedbroski|first2=Serge|title=Targeting Programmed Cell Death in Neurodegenrative Diseases|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |doi=10.1038/nrn1100|date=May 2003|volume=4|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, situations in which these mediated pathways are artificially stimulated due to injury or disease.&lt;ref name = bredesen/&gt;

====Apoptosis (type I)====
[[Apoptosis]] is a form of programmed cell death in multicellular organisms. It is one of the main types of [[programmed cell death]] (PCD) and involves a series of biochemical events leading to a characteristic cell morphology and death.

*'''Extrinsic apoptotic pathways:''' Occur when factors outside the cell activate cell surface death receptors (e.g., Fas) that result in the activation of [[caspases]]-8 or -10.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;
*'''Intrinsic apoptotic pathways:''' Result from mitochondrial release of [[cytochrome c]] or endoplasmic reticulum malfunctions, each leading to the activation of caspase-9. The [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[Golgi apparatus]] are other organelles that have damage sensors, which can lead the cells down apoptotic pathways.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;&lt;ref name = green&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Green DR, Kroemer G | title = Pharmacological manipulation of cell death: clinical applications in sight?| journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation| volume = 115| issue = 10| pages = 2610–7|date=October 2005| pmid = 16200193| pmc = 1236695| doi = 10.1172/JCI26321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caspases]] (cysteine-aspartic acid proteases) cleave at very specific [[amino acid]] residues. There are two types of caspases: '''initiators''' and '''effectors'''. Initiator caspases cleave inactive forms of effector caspases. This activates the effectors that in turn cleave other proteins resulting in apoptotic initiation.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;

====Autophagic (type II)====
Autophagy is essentially a form of intracellular [[phagocytosis]] in which a cell actively consumes damaged organelles or misfolded proteins by encapsulating them into an autophagosome, which fuses with a lysosome to destroy the contents of the autophagosome. Many neurodegenerative diseases show unusual protein aggregates. This could potentially be a result of underlying autophagic defect common to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. It is important to note that this is a hypothesis, and more research must be done.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;

====Cytoplasmic (type III)====
The final and least understood PCD mechanism is through non-apoptotic processes. These fall under Type III, or cytoplasmic cell death. Many other forms of PCD are observed but not fully understood or accepted by the scientific community. For example, PCD might be caused by trophotoxicity, or hyperactivation of trophic factor receptors. In addition to this, other cytotoxins that induce PCD at low concentrations act to cause [[necrosis]], or aponecrosis – the combination of apoptosis and necrosis, when in higher concentrations. It is still unclear exactly what combination of apoptosis, non-apoptosis, and necrosis causes different kinds of aponecrosis.&lt;ref name = bredesen /&gt;

===PCD===
In the above-mentioned neurodegenerative diseases, PCD may be pathogenic. In order to identify the potential of neuroprotective targets in PCD machinery, there were experimental models conducted on these neurodegenerative diseases. These studies showed that the expression of certain components have been altered by genetic and pharmacological means. Expression of PCD molecular components are said to be controlled by gene and antisense therapy, but this needs further research. Pharmacological approaches involve inhibitors of caspase activity, and caspase inhibition might delay cell death in the different experimental models.&lt;ref name=Nature /&gt;

===Transglutaminase===

[[Transglutaminase]]s are human [[enzymes]] [[ubiquitously]] present in the human body and in the brain in particular.&lt;ref name="caccamo"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Caccamo D, etal| title = Critical role of transglutaminase and other stress proteins during neurodegenerative processes| journal = Amino Acids| volume = 38| issue = | pages = 653–8|date=2010| pmid = 19960212| doi = 10.1007/s00726-009-0428-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main function of [[transglutaminases]] is [[Molecular binding|bind]] proteins and peptides intra- and intermolecularly, by a type of [[covalent bonds]] termed [[isopeptide bond]]s, in a reaction termed [[Isopeptide bond|transamidation]] or [[Isopeptide bond|crosslinking]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

[[Transglutaminase]] [[Chemical bond|binding]] of these proteins and peptides make them clump together. The resulting structures are turned extremely resistant to chemical and mechanical disruption.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

Most relevant human neurodegenerative diseases share the property of having [[Protein aggregation|abnormal structures made up of proteins and peptides]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

Each of these neurodegenerative disesases have one (or several) specific main protein or peptide. In [[Alzheimer's disease]], these are [[amyloid-beta]] and [[tau]]. In [[Parkinson’s]] disease, it is [[alpha-synuclein]]. In [[Huntington’s]] disease, it is [[huntingtin]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''[[Transglutaminase]] [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]]:'''
[[Amyloid-beta]], [[tau]], [[alpha-synuclein]] and [[huntingtin]] have been proved to be [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] of [[transglutaminases]] in vitro or in vivo, that is, they can be [[Chemical bond|bonded]] by trasglutaminases by [[covalent bonds]] to each other and potentially to any other transglutaminase substrate in the brain.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''[[Transglutaminase]] augmented expression:'''
It has been proved that in these neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease) the [[Gene expression|expression]] of the [[transglutaminase]] [[enzyme]] is increased.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''Presence of [[isopeptide bond]]s in these structures:'''
The presence of [[isopeptide bond]]s (the result of the [[transglutaminase]] reaction) have been detected in the [[Protein aggregation|abnormal structures that are characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases]].&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

'''Co-localization:'''
Co-localization of transglutaminase mediated [[isopeptide bond]]s with these [[Protein aggregation|abnormal structures]] has been detected in the autopsy of brains of patients with these diseases.&lt;ref name=caccamo /&gt;

==Specific disorders==

===Alzheimer's disease===
[[File:Alzheimer's Disease.gif|thumb|Normal cerebral cortex vs Alzheimer's disease]]
{{main|Alzheimer's disease}}

Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]] and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross [[atrophy]] of the affected regions, including degeneration in the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]], and parts of the [[frontal cortex]] and [[cingulate gyrus]].&lt;ref name="pmid12934968"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wenk GL|title=Neuropathologic changes in Alzheimer's disease|journal=J Clin Psychiatry|volume=64 Suppl 9|pages=7–10|year=2003|pmid=12934968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alzheimer's disease has been ''hypothesized'' to be a [[protein folding|protein misfolding]] disease ([[proteopathy]]), caused by accumulation of abnormally folded A-beta and [[Tau protein|tau proteins]] in the brain.&lt;ref name="pmid14528050"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hashimoto M, Rockenstein E, Crews L, Masliah E |title=Role of protein aggregation in mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases|journal=Neuromolecular Med.|volume=4|issue=1–2|pages=21–36|year=2003|pmid=14528050|doi=10.1385/NMM:4:1-2:21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaques are made up of small [[peptide]]s, 39–43&amp;nbsp;amino acids in length, called [[beta-amyloid]] (also written as A-beta or Aβ).

===Parkinson's disease===
{{main|Parkinson's disease}}

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26718594 | doi=10.1016/j.neurol.2015.09.012 | volume=172 | title=Epidemiology of Parkinson's disease |vauthors=Elbaz A, Carcaillon L, Kab S, Moisan F | journal=Rev Neurol (Paris) | pages=14–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and manifests as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and posture instability. The crude prevalence rate of PD has been reported to range from 15 per 100,000 to 12,500 per 100,000, and the incidence of PD from 15 per 100,000 to 328 per 100,000, with the disease being less common in Asian countries. Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. It results from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain; the cause of cell-death is unknown. The following paragraph is an excerpt from the Pathophysiology section of the article [[Parkinson's disease]].

The mechanism by which the brain cells in Parkinson's are lost ''may'' consist of an abnormal accumulation of the protein [[alpha-synuclein]] bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. The [[alpha-synuclein]]-ubiquitin complex cannot be directed to the proteasome.  This [[protein]] accumulation forms proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions called [[Lewy bodies]]. The latest research on pathogenesis of disease has shown that the death of dopaminergic neurons by alpha-synuclein is due to a defect in the machinery that transports proteins between two major cellular organelles – the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. Certain proteins like Rab1 may reverse this defect caused by alpha-synuclein in animal models.&lt;ref&gt;"Parkinson's Disease Mechanism Discovered," [http://www.hhmi.org/news/lindquist20060622.html HHMI Research News] June 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research suggests that impaired axonal transport of alpha-synuclein leads to its accumulation in the Lewy bodies. Experiments have revealed reduced transport rates of both wild-type and two familial Parkinson's disease-associated mutant alpha-synucleins through axons of cultured neurons.&lt;ref name = devos /&gt; Membrane damage by alpha-synuclein could be another Parkinson's disease mechanism.&lt;ref name=curvature/&gt;

The main known risk factor is age. Susceptibility genes including α-synuclein, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK-2), and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) have shown that genetic predisposition is another important causal factor.

Mutant [[Huntingtin]] is an aggregate-prone protein. During the cells' natural clearance process, these proteins are retrogradely transported to the cell body for destruction by lysosomes. It is a possibility that these mutant protein aggregates damage the retrograde transport of important cargoes such as [[BDNF]] by damaging molecular motors as well as microtubules.&lt;ref name = devos /&gt;

===Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)===
{{main|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}}

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) is a disease in which motor neurons are selectively targeted for degeneration. In 1993, missense mutations in the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 ([[SOD1]]) were discovered in subsets of patients with familial ALS. This discovery led researchers to focus on unlocking the mechanisms for SOD1-mediated diseases. However, the pathogenic mechanism underlying SOD1 mutant toxicity has yet to be resolved.  More recently, [[TDP-43]] and [[FUS (gene)|FUS]] protein aggregates have been implicated in some cases of the disease, and a mutation in chromosome 9 ([[C9orf72]]) is thought to be the most common known cause of sporadic ALS.

Recent independent research by Nagai et al.&lt;ref name = nagai&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nagai M, Re DB, Nagata T, etal | title = Astrocytes expressing ALS-linked mutated SOD1 release factors selectively toxic to motor neurons| journal = Nature Neuroscience| volume = 10| issue = 5| pages = 615–22|date=May 2007| pmid = 17435755| doi = 10.1038/nn1876| pmc = 3799799}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Di Giorgio et al.&lt;ref name ="  digiorgio"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Di Giorgio FP, Carrasco MA, Siao MC, Maniatis T, Eggan K | title = Non–cell autonomous effect of glia on motor neurons in an embryonic stem cell–based ALS model| journal = Nature Neuroscience| volume = 10| issue = 5| pages = 608–14|date=May 2007| pmid = 17435754| doi = 10.1038/nn1885| pmc = 3139463}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide ''in vitro'' evidence that the primary cellular sites where SOD1 mutations act are located on astrocytes. [[Astrocytes]] then cause the toxic effects on the [[motor neurons]]. The specific mechanism of toxicity still needs to be investigated, but the findings are significant because they implicate cells other than neuron cells in neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name ="  julien"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Julien JP| title = ALS: astrocytes move in as deadly neighbors| journal = Nature Neuroscience| volume = 10| issue = 5| pages = 535–7|date=May 2007| pmid = 17453052| doi = 10.1038/nn0507-535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Batten disease===
[[Batten disease]] is a rare and fatal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that begins at birth.

==Therapeutics==
The process of neurodegeneration is not well understood, so the diseases that stem from it have, as yet, no cures. In the search for effective treatments (as opposed to [[palliative care]]), investigators employ [[animal model]]s of disease to test potential therapeutic agents. Model organisms provide an inexpensive and relatively quick means to perform two main functions: target identification and target validation. Together, these help show the value of any specific therapeutic strategies and drugs when attempting to ameliorate disease severity. An example is the drug [[Dimebon]] (Medivation). This drug is in phase III clinical trials for use in Alzheimer's disease, and also recently finished phase II clinical trials for use in Huntington's disease.&lt;ref name = marsh /&gt; In March 2010, the results of a clinical trial phase III were released; the investigational Alzheimer's disease drug Dimebon failed in the pivotal CONNECTION trial of patients with mild-to-moderate disease.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2387 Dimebon Disappoints in Phase 3 Trial]&lt;/ref&gt; With CONCERT, the remaining Pfizer and Medivation Phase III trial for Dimebon (latrepirdine) in Alzheimer's disease failed in 2012, effectively ending the development in this indication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sweetlove M: Phase III CONCERT Trial of Latrepirdine. Negative results. Pharm Med 2012;26(2):113-115&lt;/ref&gt;

In another experiment using a rat model of Alzheimer's disease, it was demonstrated that systemic administration of hypothalamic proline-rich peptide (PRP)-1 offers neuroprotective effects and can prevent neurodegeneration in hippocampus [[amyloid-beta]] 25–35. This suggests that there could be therapeutic value to PRP-1.&lt;ref name = galoyan&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Galoyan AA, Sarkissian JS, Chavushyan VA, etal | title = Neuroprotection by hypothalamic peptide proline-rich peptide-1 in Aβ25–35 model of Alzheimer's disease| journal = Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia| volume = 4| issue = 5| pages = 332–44|date=September 2008| pmid = 18790460| doi = 10.1016/j.jalz.2007.10.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein degradation offers therapeutic options both in preventing the synthesis and degradation of irregular proteins. There is also interest in upregulating autophagy to help clear protein aggregates implicated in neurodegeneration. Both of these options involve very complex pathways that we are only beginning to understand.&lt;ref name="rubinsztein"/&gt;

The goal of [[immunotherapy]] is to enhance aspects of the immune system. Both active and passive vaccinations  have been proposed for Alzheimer's disease and other conditions, however more research must be done to prove safety and efficacy in humans.&lt;ref name = brody&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Brody DL, Holtzman DM | title = Active and Passive Immunotherapy for Neurodegenerative Disorders| journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience| volume = 31| issue = | pages = 175–93| year = 2008| pmid = 18352830| pmc = 2561172| doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.31.060407.125529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pulmonary hemorrhage''' (or '''pulmonary haemorrhage''') is an [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] [[bleeding]] from the [[lung]], from the upper [[respiratory tract]] and the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], and the alveoli. When evident clinically, the condition is usually massive.&lt;ref name=UCSF&gt;[http://www.ucsfhealth.org/childrens/health_professionals/manuals/29_PulmHemorrhage.pdf Pulmonary Hemorrhage Intensive Care Nursery House Staff Manual.] UCSF Children's Hospital at UCSF Medical Center. 2004:The Regents of the [[University of California]]. Retrieved 2008-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The onset of pulmonary hemorrhage is characterized by cough productive of blood (hemoptysis) and worsening of oxygenation leading to [[cyanosis]].&lt;ref name=UCSF/&gt; Treatment should be immediate and should include tracheal suction, oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and correction of underlying abnormalities (e.g. disorders of [[coagulation]]). A [[blood transfusion]] may be necessary.&lt;ref name=UCSF/&gt;

==Incidence==
The outcome of treatment is dependent on causality. Pulmonary Hemorrhage is present in 7 to 10% of neonatal autopsies, but up to 80% of autopsies of very preterm infants.&lt;ref name=UCSF/&gt; The incidence is 1 in 1,000 live births.&lt;ref name=UCSF/&gt; Pulmonary hemorrhage has a high mortality rate of 30% to 40%.&lt;ref name=UCSF/&gt;

==Causes==
[[Preterm birth|Infant prematurity]] is the factor most commonly associated with pulmonary hemorrhage. Other associated factors are those that predispose to [[perinatal asphyxia]] or [[bleeding disorder]]s, including [[pre-eclampsia|toxemia of pregnancy]], maternal [[cocaine]] use, [[erythroblastosis fetalis]], [[breech delivery]], [[hypothermia]], [[infection]], [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome]] (IRDS), administration of exogenous [[surfactant]]s (in some studies) and [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] (ECMO).&lt;ref name=UCSF/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==

Although the [[pathogenesis]] is uncertain, it is probable that the symptoms are a consequence of hemorrhagic [[pulmonary edema]], as the [[hematocrit]] is lower than normal blood (usually 15-20% less) and the concentration of small proteins is higher than in plasma.&lt;ref name=UCSF/&gt; It is postulated that the infant suffers from asphyxia with resultant [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]; this increases pulmonary microvascular pressure, resulting in pulmonary edema.&lt;ref name=UCSF/&gt; Contributing factors include factors that favor increased filtration of fluid from pulmonary [[capillaries]] (e.g., low concentration of [[plasma protein]]s, high [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] surface tension, lung damage, [[hypervolemia]]).&lt;ref name=UCSF/&gt;

=== Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage ===

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is bleeding from many [[alveoli]] throughout the lungs. Common causes include autoimmune diseases and connective tissue diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3949/ccjm.75.4.258 | last1 = Ioachimescu | first1 = O. C. | last2 = Stoller | first2 = J.

'''Rachel's Tomb''' ({{lang-he|קבר רחל}} translit.

The tomb has been considered holy to [[Jews]], [[Christians]] and [[Muslims]] for 2000 years.&lt;ref name=Strickert72&gt;{{harvnb|Strickert|2007|p=72}}: “Rather than being content with half a dozen or even a full dozen witnesses, we have tried to compile as many sources as possible. During the Roman and Byzantine era, when Christians dominated there was really not much attention given to Rachel’s Tomb in Bethlehem. It was only when the Muslims took control that the shrine became an important site. Yet it was rarely considered a shrine exclusive to one religion. To be sure, most of the witnesses were Christian, yet there were also Jewish and Muslim visitors to the tomb. Equally important, the Christian witnesses call attention to the devotion shown to the shrine throughout much of this period by local Muslims and then later also by Jews. As far as the building itself, it appears to be a cooperative venture. There is absolutely no evidence of a pillar erected by Jacob. The earliest form of the structure was that of a pyramid typical of Roman period architecture. Improvements were made first by Crusader Christians a thousand years later, then Muslims in several stages, and finally by the Jewish philanthropist Moses Montefiore in the nineteenth century. If there is one lesson to be learned, it is that this is a shrine held in esteem equally by Jews, Muslims, and Christians. As far as authenticity we are on shaky ground. It may be that the current shrine has physical roots in the biblical era. However, the evidence points to the appropriation of a tomb from the Herod family. If there was a memorial to Rachel in Bethlehem during the late biblical era, it was likely not at the current site of Rachel’s Tomb.”&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="JPost.com 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Until-1996-nobody-called-Rachels-Tomb-a-mosque|title=Until 1996, nobody called Rachel’s Tomb a mosque|date=2010-08-11|website=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinians have referred to the site  as the '''Bilal bin Rabah mosque''' ({{lang-ar|مسجد بلال بن رباح}})&lt;ref name="Gn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/29/religious-site-israel-united-nations|title=Holy site sparks row between Israel and UN|last=Carbajosa|first=Ana|date=29 October 2010|accessdate=13 March 2012|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-clashes-with-unesco-in-row-over-holy-sites-1.322758|title=Israel clashes with UNESCO in row over holy sites|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has been disputed on account of the expression (1 Sam. x. 2) " in the border of Benjamin," and there can be no doubt that the Kubbet Rahil never was on or very near this border. The Vulgate translation, however, seems perhaps to do away with this difficulty, and as Rachel’s tomb was only “a little way” from Ephrath, "which is Bethlehem" (Gen. xxxv. 16—19), and the tradition is of great antiquity, there is no very good reason for rejecting it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burial place of the matriarch [[Rachel]] as mentioned in Jewish [[Tanakh]], Christian [[Old Testament]] and in Muslim literature{{sfn|Strickert|2007|p=48}} is contested between this site and several others to the north.

The earliest extra-biblical records describing this tomb as Rachel's burial place date to the first decades of the 4th century CE. The structure in its current form dates from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, and is situated in a Christian and Muslim cemetery dating from at least the Mamluk period.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, 2015, p.34: "Jachintus’s mention of a Christian cemetery surrounding the tomb suggests that for Bethlehemites – exclusively Christian up until the late eighteenth century – the biblical site on the outskirts of the city was blessed by the presence of a nurturing saint likely to help those buried in her vicinity to achieve salvation. By the fifteenth century, according to the pilgrim Johannes Poloner, Muslims, most likely from surrounding Muslim villages, were being buried on the southern side of the shrine. Increasingly the cemetery surrounding the tomb became Muslim. In 1839, Mary Damer described bedouin burying a shaykh in the graveyard, while in 1853 James Finn wrote of witnessing Bethlehem Muslims “burying one of their dead near the spot." Philip Baldensperger, a resident of nearby Artas between 1856 and 1892, wrote of Rachel’s Tomb in his Immovable East that "a number of Bedawin, men and women, were assembled there for a funeral service, for the Bedawin of the desert of Judah all bury their dead near Rachel’s sanctuary as their forefathers the Israelites of old did around their sanctuaries."

Montefiore. It is also asserted that in 1615 Muhammad, Pasha of Jerusalem, rebuilt the Tomb on their behalf, and by firman granted them the exclusive use of it. The Moslems, on the other hand, claim the ownership of the building as being a place of prayer for Moslems of the neighbourhood, and an integral part of the Moslem cemetery within whose precincts it lies. They state that the Turkish Government recognised it as such, and sent an embroidered covering with Arabic inscriptions for the sarcophagus; again, that it is included among the Tombs of the Prophets for which identity signboards were provided by the Ministry of Waqfs in 1328. A.H. In consequence, objection is made to any repair of the building by the Jews, though free access is allowed to it at all times. From local evidence it appears that the keys were obtained by the Jews from the last Moslem guardian, by name Osman Ibrahim al Atayat, some 80 years ago.

The uncertainty about its status stems from different competing interest groups, but the ranking also indicates a recently revived and politically motivated place in the Jewish pantheon. The site’s religious status and political value have resulted in extraordinary defensive measures being adopted.

==Biblical accounts and disputed location==
===Northern vs. southern version===
Biblical scholarship identifies two different traditions in the [[Hebrew Bible]] concerning the site of Rachel's burial, respectively a northern version, locating it north of Jerusalem near [[Ramah in Benjamin|Ramah]], modern [[Al-Ram]], and a southern narrative locating it close to Bethlehem. In rabbinical tradition the duality is resolved by using two different terms in Hebrew to designate these different localities.{{sfn|Strickert|2007|pp=57, 64}} In the Hebrew version given in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]],{{sfn|Strickert|2007|p=20|ps=: "In the [[Septuagint]] translation, Bethlehem is also given but the order of the verses is changed because of geographical difficulties."}} [[Rachel]] and [[Jacob]] journey from [[Shechem]] to [[Hebron]], a short distance from [[Ephrath]], which is glossed as [[Bethlehem]] (35:16-21, 48:7). She dies on the way giving birth to [[Benjamin]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"And Rachel died, and was buried on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day."'' — [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 35:19-20&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Tom Selwyn notes that [[R. A. Stewart Macalister|R. A. S. Macalister]], the most authoritative voice on the topography of Rachel's tomb, advanced the view in 1912 that the identification with Bethlehem was based on a copyist's mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Selwyn, 'Tears on the Border: The Case of Rachel's Tomb, Bethlehem, Palestine,' in Maria Kousis, Tom Selwyn, David Clark, (eds.)''Contested Mediterranean Spaces: Ethnographic Essays in Honour of Charles Tilly,'' Berghahn Books 2011 pp. 276-295, p.279:'Macalister claims that in the earliest versions of Genesis it is written .. that Rachel was buried in Ephrathah, not Ephrath, and that this name refers to the village of Ramah, now er-Ram, near Himzeh to the north of Jerusalem.'&lt;/ref&gt;
The Judean scribal gloss "(Ephrath, ) which is Bethlehem" was added to distinguish it from a similar toponym [[Ephrathah]] in the Bethlehem region. Some consider as certain, however, that Rachel's tomb lay to the north, in [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamite]], not in Judean territory, and that the Bethlehem gloss represents a Judean appropriation of the grave, originally in the north, to enhance [[Judea|Judah]]'s prestige.&lt;ref&gt;Zecharia Kallai, 'Rachel's Tomb: A Historiographical Review,' in ''Vielseitigkeit des Altes Testaments,'' Peter Lang, Frankfurt 1999 pp.215-223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jules Francis Gomes, ''The Sanctuary of Bethel and the Configuration of Israelite Identity,'' Walter de Gruyter, 2006 p.92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.Blenkinsopp, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1zi2i_C1aNkC&amp;pg=PA631&amp;dq=Rachel's+Tomb+location&amp;lr=&amp;cd=18#v=onepage&amp;q=Rachel's%20Tomb%20location&amp;f=false 'Benjamin Traditions read in the Early Persian Period,'] in Oded Lipschitz, Manfred Oeming (eds.), ''Judah and the Judeans in the Persian period,'' Eisenbrauns, 2006 pp.629-646 p.630-31. {{ISBN|1-57506-104-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel 10:2]], Rachel's tomb is located in the 'territory of Benjamin at Zelzah.' In [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|the period of the monarchy]] down to the [[Babylonian captivity|exile]], it would follow, Rachel's tomb was thought to lie in Ramah.{{sfn|Strickert|2007|p=61-2|ps=: "one must conclude that Rachel's tomb was located near Ramah... During the time of the monarchy, from the anointing of Saul to the beginning of exile (1040-596 B.C.E.), Rachel's tomb was understood to be located in the north near Ramah."}} The indications for this are based on [[Books of Samuel|1 Sam 10:2]] and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jer. 31:15]], which give an alternative location north of Jerusalem, in the vicinity of [[ar-Ram]], biblical [[Ramah in Benjamin|Ramah]],&lt;ref&gt;Blenkinsopp, p.630-1.&lt;/ref&gt; five miles south of [[Bethel]].&lt;ref&gt;Jules Francis Gomes,''The Sanctuary of Bethel and the Configuration of Israelite Identity,'' p.135:'Rachel's tomb was originally on the border between Benjamin and Joseph. It was later located in Bethlehem as in the gloss on Gen.35:19.&lt;/ref&gt; One conjecture is that before David's conquest of Jerusalem, the ridge road from Bethel might have been called "the Ephrath road" (''derek ’eprātāh''. {{Bibleref2|Genesis 35:19}}; ''derek’eprāt,'' {{Bibleref2|Genesis 48:7}}), hence the passage in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] meant 'the road ''to'' Ephrath or Bethlehem,' on which Ramah, if that word refers to a [[toponym]],&lt;ref&gt;''ramah'' means 'a height'. Most scholars take it to refer to a place-name. Martien Halvorson-Taylor, ''Enduring Exile: The Metaphorization of Exile in the Hebrew Bible,'' BRILL 2010 p.75, n.62, thinks the evidence for this is weak, but argues the later witness of Genesis for Bethlehem as Rachel's burial site 'an even more dubious witness to its location'.&lt;/ref&gt; lay.&lt;ref&gt;David Toshio Tsumura,''The First Book of Samuel,'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2007 p.284.&lt;/ref&gt; A possible location in Ramah could be the five stone monuments north of [[Hizma]]. Known as ''[[Kubur Bani Yisra’il|Qubur Bene Isra'in]]'', the largest so-called tomb of the group, the function of which is obscure, has the name ''Qabr Umm beni Isra'in'', that is, "tomb of the mother of the descendants of Israel".&lt;ref name="Keel"&gt;{{cite book |author= Othmar Keel, Max Küchler |title= Orte und Landschaften der Bibel: ein Handbuch und Studienreiseführer zum Heiligen Land, Band 2: Der Süden |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j3jsKqzuP5YC&amp;pg=PA608 |year=1982 |publisher= Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn= 978-3-525-50167-2 |pages=608, 990, 991 |volume=2 |edition= 1st |quote= qubur bene-israin}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Strickert|2007|p=69}}

===Bethlehem structure===
As to the structure outside Bethlehem being placed exactly over an ancient tomb, it was revealed during excavations in around 1825 that it was not built over an underground cavity; however, a deep cavern was discovered a small distance from the site.&lt;ref name="Schwarz1850"&gt;Schwarz, Joseph. [http://www.jewish-history.com/Palestine/desert.html Descriptive Geography and Brief Historical Sketch of Palestine], 1850. "It was always believed that this stood over the grave of the beloved wife of Jacob. But about twenty-five years ago, when the structure needed some repairs, they were compelled to dig down at the foot of this monument; and it was then found that it was not erected over the cavity in which the grave of Rachel actually is; but at a little distance from the monument there was discovered an uncommonly deep cavern, the opening and direction of which was not precisely under the superstructure in question."&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditions regarding the tomb at this location date back to the beginning of the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name=CCKJ&gt;Pringle, 1998, p.

In the late 7th century, the tomb was marked with a stone pyramid, devoid of any ornamentation.{{sfn|Sharon|1999|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=EPFDU8POrXIC&amp;pg=PA177  177}}&lt;ref name=BrP&gt;Edward Robinson, Eli Smith.

===Crusader period===
[[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] (1154) writes, "Half-way down the road [between Bethlehem and Jerusalem] is the tomb of Rachel (''Rahil''), the mother of Joseph and of Benjamin, the two sons of Jacob peace upon them all! The tomb is covered by twelve stones, and above it is a dome vaulted."{{sfn|le Strange|1890|p=[https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/299/mode/1up 299]}}

===Mamluk period===
In the 14th century, Antony of Cremona referred to the cenotaph as "the most wonderful tomb that I shall ever see. I do not think that with 20 pairs of oxen it would be possible to extract or move one of its stones." It was described by Franciscan pilgrim Nicolas of [[Poggibonsi]] (1346–50) as being 7 feet high and enclosed by a rounded tomb with three gates.

From around the 15th century onwards, if not earlier, the tomb was occupied and maintained by the Muslim rulers.&lt;ref name=CCKJ/&gt; The Russian deacon Zozimos describes it as being a mosque in 1421.&lt;ref name=CCKJ/&gt; A guide published in 1467 credits Shahin al-Dhahiri with the building of a cupola, cistern and drinking fountain at the site.&lt;ref name=CCKJ/&gt; The Muslim rebuilding of the "dome on four columns" was also mentioned by Francesco Suriano in 1485.&lt;ref name=CCKJ/&gt; [[Felix Fabri]] (1480–83) described it as being "a lofty pyramid, built of square and polished white stone";&lt;ref name=Fabri547&gt;Fabri, 1896, p.[https://archive.org/stream/libraryofpalesti08paleuoft#page/547/mode/1up 547]&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted a drinking water trough at its side and reported that "this place is venerated alike by Muslims, Jews, and Christians".&lt;ref name=Fabri547/&gt;  [[Bernhard von Breidenbach]] of Mainz (1483) described women praying at the tomb and collecting stones to take home, believing that they would ease their labour.&lt;ref name="Lamdan2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth Lamdan|title=A separate people: Jewish women in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt in the sixteenth century |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OKlYce7f8iAC&amp;pg=PA84 |accessdate=12 October 2010 |year=2000 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-11747-1 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Everson&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=furi5PakHW4C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22tomb+of+rachel%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=59#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tomb%20of%20rachel%22&amp;f=false Reflections of God's Holy Land: A Personal Journey Through Israel], Thomas Nelson Inc, 2008. p. 57. {{ISBN|0-8499-1956-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pietro Casola]] (1494) described it as being "beautiful and much honoured by the [[Moors]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/canonpietrocasol00casouoft/canonpietrocasol00casouoft_djvu.txt |title= Further on, near to Bethlehem, I saw the sepulchre of Rachel, the wife of the Patriarch Jacob, who died in childbirth.

In March 1756, the Istanbul Jewish Committee for the Jews of Palestine instructed that 500 ''kurus'' used by the Jews of Jerusalem to fix a wall at the tomb were to be repaid and used instead for more deserving causes.{{sfn|Strickert|2007|p=111}} In 1788, walls were built to enclose the arches.&lt;ref name=PGG/&gt; According to [[Richard Pococke]], this was done to "hinder the Jews from going into it".

====Nineteenth century====
[[File:Rachel's Tomb, c. 1840.JPG|thumb|The tomb in c.1840, immediately before Montefiore's renovations]]
In 1806 [[François-René Chateaubriand]] described it as  "a square edifice, surmounted with a small dome: it enjoys the privileges of a [[mosque]], for the Turks as well as the Arabs, honour the families of the patriarchs. [..] it is evidently a Turkish edifice, erected in memory of a santon.&lt;ref&gt;Chateaubriand, 1814, vol 1, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/travelsingreecep01chat#page/390/mode/1up 390]-391&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1824 report described "a stone building, evidently of Turkish construction, which terminates at the top in a dome. Within this edifice is the tomb. It is a pile of stones covered with white plaster, about 10 feet long and nearly as high. The inner wall of the building and the sides of the tomb are covered with Hebrew names, inscribed by Jews."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GUI2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=rachel's+tomb+is+located&amp;lr=&amp;cd=144#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The religious miscellany: Volume 3] Fleming and Geddes, 1824, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

When the structure was undergoing repairs in around 1825, excavations at the foot of the monument revealed that it was not built directly over an underground cavity. However, a small distance from the site, an unusually deep cavern was discovered.&lt;ref name="Schwarz1850"/&gt;

In 1830, the Ottomans legally recognized the tomb as a Jewish holy site.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} [[History of Zionism#Proto-Zionism|Proto-Zionist]] banker Sir [[Moses Montefiore]] visited Rachel's Tomb together with his wife on their first visit to the Holy Land in 1828.&lt;ref name="Green2012"&gt;{{cite book |author= Abigail Green |title= Moses Montefiore |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dGeM6r_YbocC&amp;pg=PT67 |date=7 May 2012 |publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-28314-5 |page=67 |quote=On the second day of their visit, Amzalak took Montefiore on a tour of communal institutions and Jewish holy places. Judith, meanwhile, set out on a day trip to Bethlehem, stopping at the Tomb of Rachel, which she visited in the company of a group of Jewish women. This desolate, solitary, crumbling ruin, its dome half open to the elements, was a holy site for all Jews. For an infertile woman like Judith it may have had special significance. The Old Testament contains many tales of barren women who were finally able to conceive through divine intervention. The matriarch Rachel was one of them. Indeed, Rachel had been so distressed by her inability to bear children that she went to her husband Jacob and complained, "Give me a child! And if there will be no child, I shall die!" Consequently, the Tomb of Rachel has become a favorite site of religious pilgrimage for infertile Jewish women. It seems strange to associate such a practice with a well-educated Englishwoman like Judith. Yet she must have been more aware of these superstitions than her published diaries indicate, because Judith was the owner of a fertility amulet-written for her by two Sephardi rabbis, whose family were the hereditary guardians of Rachel’s Tomb.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were childless, and Lady Montefiore was deeply moved by the tomb,&lt;ref name="Green2012"/&gt; which was in good condition at that time. Before the couple's next visit, in 1839, the [[Galilee earthquake of 1837]] had heavily damaged the tomb.{{sfn|Strickert|2007|pp=112-113}} In 1838 the tomb was described as "merely an ordinary Muslim Wely, or tomb of a holy person; a small square building of stone with a dome, and within it a tomb in the ordinary Muhammedan form; the whole plastered over with mortar. It is neglected and falling to decay; though pilgrimages are still made to it by the Jews. The naked walls are covered with names in several languages; many of them Hebrew."&lt;ref name=BrP/&gt;

In 1841, Montefiore renovated the site and obtained for the Jews the key of the tomb. He renovated the entire structure, reconstructing and re-plastering its white dome, and added an antechamber, including a mihrab for Muslim prayer, to ease Muslim fears.&lt;ref name="Owen1977"&gt;{{cite book |author= George Frederick Owen |title=The Holy Land |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lew1z5RKW6kC |accessdate=2 January 2012 |date=1 July 1977 |publisher= Beacon Hill Press |location=Kansas City |isbn=978-0-8341-0489-1 |page=159 |quote=In 1841, Sir M. Montefiore purchased the grounds and monument for the Jewish community, added an adjoining prayer vestibule, and reconditioned the entire structure with its white dome and quiet reception or prayer room.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Glenn Bowman notes that some writers have described this as a “purchase” of the tomb by Montefiore, asserting that this was not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, 2014, p.39: “The idea that Moses Montefiore bought the site of Rachel’s Tomb in 1841 is widely disseminated but ill conceived. The notion is variously promoted by religious national- ists associated with the current occupation of the site, but has spread more widely and appears in texts as diverse as Denys Pringle’s The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem (“the tomb was acquired”);59 Davidson and Gitlitz’s Pilgrimage from the Ganges to Graceland: An Encyclopedia (Montefiore “bought the site”);60 and Wikipedia (Montefiore “purchased the site”).61 Nadav Shragai, a journalist on the religious right, has written an influential book in Hebrew on Rachel’s Tomb,62 which he has drawn upon in numerous articles, nearly all radical defenses of Jewish rights to the tomb in the face of Palestinian threats. In his work he has claimed that Montefiore’s permission to carry out repairs on the site in 1841 confirmed that “the Turkish [sic] authorities ... recognized the place as the holy property of the Jews.”63 Meron Benvenisti, a left-leaning politi- cian and writer whose Sacred Landscape (2000) is a landmark study of the erasure and expropriation of Palestinian heritage, also sees Rachel’s Tomb as Jewish property, going even further than Shragai in his autobiographical Son of the Cypresses, where he claims that Rachel’s Tomb “is one of the few sites in Eretz Israel that have always remained exclusively in Jewish hands.”64”&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1843, [[Ridley Haim Herschell]] described the building as an ordinary Muslim tomb. He reported that Jews, including Montefiore, were obliged to remain outside the tomb, and prayed at a hole in the wall, so that their voices enter into the tomb.&lt;ref name="Herschell1844"&gt;{{cite book |author= Ridley Haim Herschell |authorlink= Ridley Haim Herschell |title=A visit to my father-land: being notes of a journey to Syria and Palestine in 1843 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LydPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA191 |accessdate=3 January 2012 |year=1844 |publisher=Unwin |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, [[William Henry Bartlett]] referred to the tomb as a "Turkish Mosque", following a visit to the area in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Henry Bartlett]], [https://archive.org/stream/walksaboutcityen00bart#page/204/mode/1up Walks about the city and environs of Jerusalem], page 204&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Elizabeth Anne Finn]], wife of the British consul, [[James Finn]], the only time the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jewish community]] left the Old City of Jerusalem was for monthly prayers at "Rachel's Sepulchre" or Hebron.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem in the 19th Century: The Old City'', Yehoshua Ben-Arieh, Yad Yitzhak Ben Zvi &amp; St. Martin's Press, 1984, pp.286-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, the Jews of [[Bombay]] donated money to dig a well. Although Rachel's Tomb was only an hour and a half walk from the Old City of Jerusalem, many pilgrims found themselves very thirsty and unable to obtain fresh water. Every ''[[Rosh Chodesh]]'' (beginning of the Jewish month), the [[Maiden of Ludmir]] would lead her followers to Rachel’s tomb and lead a prayer service with various rituals, which included spreading out requests of the past four weeks over the tomb. On the traditional anniversary of Rachel's death, she would lead a solemn procession to the tomb where she chanted [[psalms]] in a night-long vigil.&lt;ref name="Deutsch2003"&gt;{{cite book |author= Nathaniel Deutsch |title=The maiden of Ludmir: a Jewish holy woman and her world |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=K4WylwfJNOoC&amp;pg=PA201 |accessdate=10 November 2010 |date=6 October 2003 |publisher= University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-23191-7 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868 a publication by the Catholic missionary society the [[Paulist Fathers]] noted that "[Rachel's] memory has always been held in respect by the Jews and Christians, and even now the former go there every Thursday, to pray and read the old, old history of this mother of their race.

The Hebrew monthly ''ha-Levanon'' of August 19, 1869, rumored that a group of Christians had purchased land around the tomb and were in the process of demolishing Montefiore's vestibule in order to erect a church there.&lt;ref name="ha-YahadutWomen1998"&gt;{{cite book |author1= Mekhon Shekhṭer le-limude ha-Yahadut |author2= International Research Institute on Jewish Women |title= Nashim: a journal of Jewish women's studies &amp; gender issues |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yaSzAAAAIAAJ |accessdate=30 January 2011 |year=1998 |publisher= Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years, land in the vicinity of the tomb was acquired by [[Nathan Straus]].

Three months after the British occupation of Palestine the whole place was cleaned and whitewashed by the Jews without protest from the Muslims. However, in 1921 when the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbinate]] applied to the Municipality of Bethlehem for permission to perform repairs at the site, local Muslims objected.&lt;ref name=UNJC&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/un_palestine_holy_places_1.htm United Nations Conciliation Commission For Palestine: Committee on Jerusalem.

However, so much indignation was caused in Jewish circles by this decision that the matter was dropped, the repairs not being considered urgent.&lt;ref name=UNJC/&gt; In 1925 the Sephardic Jewish community requested permission to repair the tomb. The building was then made structurally sound and exterior repairs were effected by the Government, but permission was refused by the Jews (who had the keys) for the Government to repair the interior of the shrine. As the interior repairs were unimportant, the Government dropped the matter, in order to avoid controversy.&lt;ref name=UNJC/&gt; In 1926 [[Max Bodenheimer]] blamed the Jews for letting one of their holy sites appear so neglected and uncared for.&lt;ref name="Bodenheimer1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Bodenheimer|title=Prelude to Israel: the memoirs of M.

During this period, both Jews and Muslims visited the site. From the 1940s, it came to be viewed as a symbol of the Jewish people's return to Zion, to its ancient homeland,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sered, "A Tale of Three Rachels: The Natural Herstory of a Cultural Symbol," in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yaSzAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22+contrast,+Rachel's+Tomb+became+explicitly+identified+with+%22&amp;dq=%22+contrast,+Rachel's+Tomb+became+explicitly+identified+with+%22&amp;cd=1 ''Nashim: a journal of Jewish women's studies &amp; gender issues, Issues 1-2'']'', Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies, 1998. "In the 1940s, by contrast, Rachel's Tomb became explicitly identified with the

The building was also used for [[Islamic funeral]] rituals. It is reported that Jews and Muslims respected each other and accommodated each other's rituals.&lt;ref name=Selwyn/&gt;
During the [[1929 Palestine riots|riots of 1929]], violence hampered regular visits by Jews to the tomb.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Both Jews and Muslims demanded control of the site, with the Muslims claiming it was an integral part of the Muslim cemetery within which it is situated.&lt;ref name=Cust/&gt; It also demanded a renewal of the old Muslim custom of purifying corpses in the tomb's antechamber.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Jordanian period===
Following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] till 1967, the site was [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|ruled by Jordan]] and occupied by the Islamic [[waqf]]. On December 11, 1948, the UN General Assembly passed [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|Resolution 194]] which called for free access to all the holy places in Israel and the remainder of the territory of the former Palestine Mandate of Great Britain. In April 1949, the Jerusalem Committee prepared a document for the UN Secretariat in order to establish the status of the different holy places in the area of the former British Mandate for Palestine. It noted that ownership of Rachel's Tomb was claimed by both Jews and Muslims. The Jews claimed possession by virtue of a 1615 [[firman (decree)|firman]] granted by the Pasha of Jerusalem which gave them exclusive use of the site and that the building, which had fallen into decay, was entirely restored by Moses Montefiore in 1845; the keys were obtained by the Jews from the last Muslim guardian at this time. The Muslims claimed the site was a place of Muslim prayer and an integral part of the Muslim cemetery within which it was situated.&lt;ref name=Cust/&gt; They stated that the Ottoman Government had recognised it as such and that it is included among the Tombs of the Prophets for which identity signboards were issued by the Ministry of Waqfs in 1898. They also asserted that the antechamber built by Montefiore was specially built as a place of prayer for Muslims. The UN ruled that the ''status quo'', an arrangement approved by the Ottoman Decree of 1757 concerning rights, privileges and practices in certain Holy Places, apply to the site.&lt;ref name=UNJC/&gt;

In theory, free access was to be granted as stipulated in the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], though Israelis, unable to enter Jordan, were prevented from visiting.&lt;ref name=RG&gt;Daniel Jacobs, Shirley Eber, Francesca Silvani.

Following the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, Israel occupied of the [[West Bank]], which included the tomb. The tomb was placed under Israeli military administration.

Following the [[Oslo accords]], the Israeli–Palestinian Interim Agreement was signed on September 28, 1995,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} placing Rachel's Tomb in [[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]] under Israeli jurisdiction. Originally, [[Yitzhak Rabin]] had decided to cede Rachel's Tomb, along with Bethlehem.&lt;ref name="Barnea" /&gt; Israel's first draft had placed Rachel's Tomb, which is situated 460 metres from the municipal border of Jerusalem, in [[Administrative divisions of the Oslo Accords|Area A]] under PA jurisdiction. Popular pressure exerted by religious parties in Israel to keep the religious site under Israeli control threatened the agreement, and Yassir Arafat agreed to forego the request.&lt;ref name=SOC /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnea"&gt;Nahum Barnea, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4589339,00.html 'The battle for Jerusalem,'] [[Ynet]], 10 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JP&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=169385 Thousands at burial of Rabbi Menahem Porush], ''Jerusalem Post'', (February 23, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rachels tomb.JPG|thumb|left|[[Haredi]] Jews praying at the tomb]]
On December 1, 1995, Bethlehem, with the exception of the tomb enclave, passed under the full control of the Palestinian Authority. Jews could reach it in bulletproof vehicles under military supervision.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 1996 Israel began an 18-month fortification of the site at a cost of $2m. It included a 13 foot high wall and adjacent military post.{{sfn|Strickert|2007|p=135|ps=: "Months later in early 1996, things began to change at rachel’s tomb. My daily taxi rides were diverted through bethlehem side streets while con- struction workers began to change the face of this ancient monument. that historic route taken by several-millennia-worth of travelers was changed per- manently four years later so that traffic no longer passes in front of rachel’s tomb. the renovations took eighteen months and cost well over two million dollars. Part of the reason for the project was to facilitate larger numbers of pilgrims; the prayer area multiplied five-fold. But most of the changes were in the name of security. Thirteen-foot-high security walls now block the view of the well-recognized white dome from all directions but above."}} In response, Palestinians said that "the Tomb of Rachel was on Islamic land" and that the structure was in fact a mosque built at the time of the Arab conquest in honour of [[Bilal ibn Rabah]], an [[Ethiopia]]n known in Islamic history as the first [[muezzin]].

After an attack on [[Joseph's Tomb]] and its subsequent takeover by Arabs, hundreds of residents of Bethlehem and the [[Aida (camp)|Aida refugee camp]], led by the Palestinian Authority-appointed governor of Bethlehem, Muhammad Rashad al-Jabari, attacked Rachel's Tomb. They set the scaffolding that had been erected around it on fire and tried to break in. The [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] dispersed the mob with gunfire and [[stun grenade]]s, and dozens were wounded.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In the following years, the Israeli-controlled site became a flashpoint between young Palestinians who [[Palestinian stone-throwing|hurled stones]], bottles and firebombs and IDF troops, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.&lt;ref&gt;Unrest during the late 1990s:

At the end of 2000, when the [[second intifada]] broke out, the tomb came under attack for 41 days. [[Fatah]] operatives and members of the Palestinian security services who were responsible for curbing militant activity against Israelis actively participated in it. In May 2001, fifty Jews found themselves trapped inside by a firefight between the IDF and Palestinian Authority gunmen. In March 2002 the IDF returned to Bethlehem as part of [[Operation Defensive Shield]] and remained there for an extended period of time.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In September 2002, the tomb was incorporated on the Israeli side of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|West Bank barrier]] and surrounded by a concrete wall and watchtowers.

In February 2005, the [[Israel Supreme Court]] rejected a Palestinian appeal to change the route of the security fence in the region of the tomb.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Israeli construction destroyed the Palestinian neighbourhood of ''Qubbet Rahil''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Israel also declared the area to be a part of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Selwyn&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Selwyn|title=CONTESTED MEDITERRANEAN SPACES:The Case of Rachel's Tomb, Bethlehem, Palestine|publisher=[[Berghahn Books]]|pages=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011, a "Wall Museum" was created by Palestinians on the North wall of the Israeli separation barrier surrounding Rachel’s tomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?id=447156 Maan News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/jef.2017.11.issue-1/jef-2017-0006/jef-2017-0006.pdf Journal of Ethnology and Folkloristics 11 (1): 83–110 DOI: 10.1515/jef-2017-0006]: "The Arab Educational Institute (AEI), which is a member of the international peace movement Pax Christi, opened the Sumud Story House in 2009.

The Hebron Road connected Jerusalem with Bethlehem: its northern section was the busiest street in town. It was the gateway from Jerusalem into Bethlehem. After entering Bethlehem along the main road, visitors either chose the direction to Hebron or the road to the Church of the Nativity. Times have changed. During the 1990s Rachel’s Tomb became an Israeli military stronghold with the Jerusalem-Bethlehem checkpoint close by. As such it was a focus of Palestinian protests, especially during the second intifada after September 2000. In 2004-05 Israel built walls near the Tomb and a surrounding enclave, both of which it had already annexed to Jerusalem. The Tomb thus became forbidden territory to inhabitants of Bethlehem. In the course of time no less than sixty-four shops, garages, and workshops along the Hebron Road closed their doors. This was not just because of the fighting, shooting and shelling going on during the second intifada, but also because the area became desolate as a result of the Wall. Parents warned their children not to visit the area with its imposing 8-9 meter high concrete Wall – almost twice as high as the Berlin Wall."&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that the tomb would become a part of the national Jewish heritage sites rehabilitation plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/u-s-slams-israel-over-designating-heritage-sites-1.263737 |title=US slams Israel over designating heritage sites |agency=Associated Press|date=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was opposed by the Palestinian Authority, who saw it as a political decision associated with Israel's settlement project.&lt;ref name="Gn" /&gt; The UN's special coordinator for the Middle East, Robert Serry, issued a statement of concern over the move, saying that the site is in Palestinian territory and has significance in both Judaism and Islam.&lt;ref name=HzNA&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/un-israel-heritage-sites-are-on-palestinian-land-1.266107 |title=UN: Israel 'heritage sites' are on Palestinian land

==Jewish religious significance==

===Rabbinic traditions===
In Jewish lore, Rachel was born on 11 [[Cheshvan]] 1553&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Calendar, [http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/day.asp%3Ftdate%3D10/27/2012 Passing of Rachel], Chabad.org.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*According to the [[Midrash]], the first person to pray at Rachel's tomb was her eldest son, [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]. While he was being carried away to Egypt after his brothers had sold him into slavery, he broke away from his captors and ran to his mother's grave. He threw himself upon the ground, wept aloud and cried "Mother! mother! Wake up. Arise and see my suffering." He heard his mother respond: "Do not fear. Go with them, and God will be with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/special/israel/points_of_interest_cdo/aid/602502/jewish/Rachels-Tomb.htm |title=Rachel's Tomb - - Israel |publisher=Chabad.org |date= |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A number of reasons are given why Rachel was buried by the road side and not in the [[Cave of Machpela]] with the other Patriarchs and Matriarchs:
**Jacob foresaw that following the destruction of the [[First Temple]] the Jews would be exiled to Babylon. They would cry out as they passed her grave, and be comforted by her. She would intercede on their behalf, asking for mercy from God who would hear her prayer.&lt;ref name="Levy2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryna Jocheved Levy|title=Waiting for Rain: Reflections at the Turning of the Year|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlucFJybYKQC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=10 November 2010|date=April 2008|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|isbn=978-0-8276-0841-2|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Although Rachel was buried within the boundaries of the Holy Land, she was not buried in the Cave of Machpelah due to her sudden and unexpected death.

===Location===
Early Jewish scholars noticed an apparent contradiction in the Bible with regards to the location of Rachel's grave. In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], the Bible states that Rachel was buried "on the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem." Yet a reference to her tomb in [[Book of Samuel|Samuel]] states: "When you go from me today, you will find two men by Rachel's tomb, in the border of [[Tribe of Benjamin#Territory|Benjamin]], in Zelzah" (1 Sam 10:2). [[Rashi]] asks: "Now, isn't Rachel's tomb in the border of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]], in Bethlehem?" He explains that the verse rather means: "Now they are by Rachel's tomb, and when you will meet them, you will find them in the border of Benjamin, in Zelzah." Similarly, [[Nahmanides|Ramban]] assumes that the site shown today near Bethlehem reflects an authentic tradition. After he had arrived in Jerusalem and seen "with his own eyes" that Rachel's tomb was on the outskirts of Bethlehem, he retracted his original understanding of her tomb being located north of Jerusalem and concluded that the reference in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] (Jer 31:15) which seemed to place her burial place in [[Ramah in Benjamin|Ramah]], is to be understood allegorically. There remains however, a dispute as to whether her tomb near Bethlehem was in the tribal territory of Judah, or of her son [[Benjamin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramban. Genesis, Volume 2. Mesorah Publications Ltd, 2005. p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customs===
A Jewish tradition teaches that Rachel weeps for her children and that when the Jews were taken into exile, she wept as they passed by her grave on the way to [[Babylonia]]. Jews have made pilgrimage to the tomb since ancient times.&lt;ref name="Gilbert1985"/&gt;

There is a tradition regarding the key that unlocked the door to the tomb. The key was about {{convert|15|cm}} long and made of brass. The [[beadle]] kept it with him at all times, and it was not uncommon that someone would knock at his door in the middle of the night requesting it to ease the labor pains of an expectant mother. The key was placed under her pillow and almost immediately, the pains would subside and the delivery would take place peacefully.

Till this day there is an ancient tradition regarding a ''segulah'' or charm which is the most famous women's ritual at the tomb.&lt;ref name=SeredGrotto&gt;Susan Sered, "Rachel's Tomb and the Milk Grotto of the Virgin Mary: Two Women's Shrines in Bethlehem", ''Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion'', vol 2, 1986, pp. 7–22.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[red string (Kabbalah)|red string]] is tied around the tomb seven times then worn as a charm for fertility.&lt;ref name=SeredGrotto/&gt; This use of the string is comparatively recent, though there is a report of its use to ward off diseases in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=SeredCult&gt;Susan Sered, "Rachel's Tomb: The Development of a Cult", ''Jewish Studies Quarterly'', vol 2, 1995, pp. 103–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Torah Ark]] in Rachel's Tomb is covered with a curtain (Hebrew: ''parokhet'') made from the wedding gown of [[Nava Applebaum]], a young Israeli woman who was killed by a Palestinian terrorist in a suicide bombing at [[Café Hillel]] in Jerusalem in 2003, on the eve of her wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''The Story of Rachel's Tomb'', Joshua Schwartz, ''Jewish Quarterly Review'' 97.3 (2007) e100-e103 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jewish_quarterly_review/v097/97.3schwartz.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] '''Ralph Kerr''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (16 August 1891 &amp;ndash; 24 May 1941) was an officer in the [[Royal Navy]]. He served in the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, and was killed in the sinking of {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} by the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']] at the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]].

==Early life==
Kerr was born on 16 August 1891, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Russell Kerr, and his wife Lady Kerr, of [[Newnham on Severn]], [[Gloucestershire]].  He joined the Royal Navy on 15 May 1904, and after service as a [[cadet]] he rose through the ranks, being promoted to Lieutenant on 28 February 1914.&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;[http://www.hmshood.com/crew/memorial/k/KerrR.htm Kerr's biography]&lt;/ref&gt;  He served in the First World War, spending most of the period aboard the [[battleship]] [[HMS Benbow (1913)|HMS ''Benbow'']], the [[flagship]] of Admiral Sir [[Doveton Sturdee]]. He was present at the [[Battle of Jutland]] in May 1916, and by 1918 he had been given his own command, that of the [[destroyer]] [[HMS Cossack (1907)|HMS ''Cossack'']].&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

==With the destroyers==
Kerr was promoted to commander on 30 June 1927, and in December 1928 he was given command of the destroyer [[HMS Windsor (D42)|HMS ''Windsor'']], followed by [[HMS Thruster (1917)|HMS ''Thruster'']] in August 1929. He commanded ''Thruster'' until February 1931, and after a year on land, returned to sea in February 1932 in command of [[HMS Decoy (H75)|HMS ''Decoy'']].  Promotion to captain followed on 30 June 1935, and on 6 September 1935 he became commander of the [[Flotilla leader]] and captain (D) of the 21st Destroyer Flotilla.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;  He stepped down from the position on 22 May 1936.  His commander, Admiral Thomson, reported that he had found Kerr to be &lt;blockquote&gt;"A very capable Captain (D) who has trained his Flotilla well. An officer probably much better suited to the practical side of naval life rather than to Staff duties. A strong personality with definite powers of command and a very good seaman. Most loyal and is very thorough in the carrying out of his duties. Social qualities good. Physically fit and has good powers of endurance."&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kerr became senior officer, [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|Reserve Fleet]] aboard [[HMS Caledon (D53)|HMS ''Caledon'']] in July 1936, transferring to [[HMS Colombo (D89)|HMS ''Colombo'']] on 3 November 1936.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;  As well as being the senior officer of the reserve fleet he then also became chief staff officer to the rear-admiral of the [[10th Cruiser Squadron]], where he remained for the next year, until July 1937.  Vice-Admiral [[Gerald Charles Dickens|Sir Gerald Dickens]] also produced a highly favourable report, noting that Kerr was &lt;blockquote&gt;"A very keen zealous officer who has done well as Senior Officer Reserve Fleet. Has plenty of character and drive and is mentally alert. A good seaman and a sound administrator. Very loyal, while ambitious to do well. Good social qualities. Keeps fit."&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kerr was to have then received an appointment to command the Flotilla leader [[HMS Duncan (D99)|HMS ''Duncan'']], where he would be captain (D) of the [[8th Destroyer Flotilla]].  The appointment was cancelled before he could take it up however.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; Instead, after a period of training, he became commander of [[HMS Hardy (1936)|HMS ''Hardy'']] and captain (D) of the [[2nd Destroyer Flotilla]]. During this period he served under Vice-Admiral [[John Tovey]], and impressed both him, and the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Admiral Sir [[Dudley Pound]].&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;  Kerr then took command of [[HMS Broke (D83)|HMS ''Broke'']] and the [[15th Destroyer Flotilla]], later transferring to the [[shore establishment]] [[HMS Cochrane (shore establishment)|HMS ''Cochrane'']], at [[Rosyth]] on 30 August 1939.  He remained at Rosyth with the Rosyth Destroyer Force until 24 January 1940, spending time on the staff of the commander-in-chief, Rosyth. He was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1940.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

==HMS ''Hood''==
Kerr took command of the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} on 15 February 1941.  Command of the Navy's largest capital ship was a major change, Kerr having only previously commanded destroyers.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;  He took her to sea on the completion of her refit in mid March, and carried out gunnery exercises and patrols off [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;  He was commander of ''Hood'' for just three months, when he was killed at the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], along with most of his crew, when ''Hood'' was sunk by the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']]. He was posthumously [[Mentioned in Despatches]].&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; Kerr is commemorated on Portsmouth Naval Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2370052 Casualty details—Kerr, Ralph], [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He had married Margaret Augusta Kerr on 14 February 1920, the marriage producing two children, Russell and Jane.  They resided in [[St John's Wood]], [[London]].  Russell Kerr, who had served as a captain in the [[Royal Artillery]] and as a tank commander, was killed while fighting in [[Burma]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2086626 Casualty details—Kerr, Russell Charles], [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2911">The '''Registry of Standard Biological Parts''' is a collection of genetic parts that are used in the assembly of systems and devices in [[synthetic biology]]. The registry was founded in 2003 at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. The registry, as of 2018, contains over 20,000 parts. Recipients of the genetic parts include academic labs, established scientists, and student teams participating in [[International Genetically Engineered Machine|the iGEM Foundation]]'s annual synthetic biology competition.&lt;ref&gt;Bland, Eric. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33728433/ns/technology_and_science-science/ Bright bacteria wins synthetic biology contest.] ''[[MSNBC]].'' 6 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Registry of Standard Biological Parts conforms to the [[BioBrick]] standard, a standard for interchangeable genetic parts. BioBrick was developed by a nonprofit composed of researchers from [[MIT]], [[Harvard]], and [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]]. The registry offers genetic parts with the expectation that recipients will contribute data and new parts to improve the resource. The registry records and indexes biological parts and offers services including the synthesis and assembly of biological parts, systems, and devices.

The registry offers many types of biological parts, including [[DNA]], [[plasmid]]s, plasmid backbones, [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], [[promotor (biology)|promoter]]s, protein coding sequences, [[protein domain]]s, [[ribosomal binding site]]s, [[Terminator (genetics)|terminators]], translational units, [[riboregulator]]s, and composite parts.&lt;ref&gt;Madrigal, Alexis. [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/11/students-engine/ Students Engineer Microbes with “Genetic Legos".] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]].'' 7 Nov. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes devices such as protein generators, [[reporter gene|reporters]], [[Inverter (logic gate)|inverters]], [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], senders, and measurement devices. A key idea that motivated the development of the Registry was to develop an abstraction hierarchy implemented through the parts categorization system.&lt;ref&gt;Endy, D [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7067/full/nature04342.html "Foundations for engineering biology"] ''[[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]'' 438, 449–453 (24 November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  

The registry has previously received external funding through grants from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]], and the [[National Institutes of Health]].

'''Space food''' is a type of food product created and [[Food processing|processed]] for consumption by [[astronaut]]s in [[outer space]]. The food has specific requirements of providing balanced nutrition for individuals working in space, while being easy and safe to store, prepare and consume in the machinery-filled [[Weightlessness|weightless]] environments of manned [[spacecraft]]. 

In recent years, space food has been used by various nations engaging on space programs as a way to share and show off their [[cultural identity]] and facilitate [[intercultural communication]]. Although astronauts consume a wide variety of foods and beverages in space, the initial idea from The Man in Space Committee of the Space Science Board in 1963 was to supply astronauts with a formula diet that would supply all the needed vitamins and nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12419/working-group-on-nutrition-and-feeding-problems |title=Working Group on Nutrition and Feeding Problems |publisher=The National Academies Press |date=April 1963 |doi=10.17226/12419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:AstronautsEatingBurgers.jpg|thumb|right|Astronauts making and eating hamburgers on board the ISS August 2007.]]

For lunch on Vostok I (1961) [[Yuri Gagarin]] ate from three 160 g toothpaste-type tubes, two of which contained servings of puréed meat and one which contained chocolate sauce.

In August 1961, Soviet Cosmonaut [[Gherman Titov]] became the first human to experience [[space sickness]] on Vostok II; he holds the record for being the first person to vomit in space.&lt;ref name="Guinness2012"&gt;{{cite book |title=Guinness World Records 2013 |publisher=Guinness World Records |editor-first=Craig |editor-last=Glenday |page=27 |date=2012 |isbn=9781904994879}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lane and Feeback, this event "heralded the need for space flight nutrition."&lt;ref name="Lane2002"&gt;{{cite journal |title=History of nutrition in space flight |journal=Nutrition |first1=Helen W. |last1=Lane |first2=Daniel L. |last2=Feeback |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=797–804 |date=October 2002 |doi=10.1016/S0899-9007(02)00946-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of [[John Glenn]]'s many tasks, as the first American to orbit Earth in 1962, was to experiment with eating in weightless conditions. Some experts had been concerned that weightlessness would impair swallowing. Glenn experienced no difficulties and it was determined that [[microgravity]] did not affect the natural [[swallowing]] process, which is enabled by the [[peristalsis]] of the [[esophagus]].

Astronauts in later [[Project Mercury|Mercury missions]] (1959–1963) disliked the food that was provided. They ate bite-sized cubes, freeze-dried powders, and tubes of semiliquids. The astronauts found it unappetizing, experienced difficulties in rehydrating the freeze-dried foods, and did not like having to squeeze tubes or collect crumbs.&lt;ref name=FFSF/&gt; Prior to the mission, the astronauts were also fed [[Low residue diet|''low residual'']] launch-day breakfasts, to reduce the chances that they would defecate in flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.americaspace.com/?p=18434 |title="Why Postpone a Success?" The Days Before Freedom 7 |first=Ben |last=Evans |publisher=AmericaSpace, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project Gemini and Apollo (1965–1975)===
Several of the food issues from the Mercury missions were addressed for the later [[Project Gemini|Gemini missions]] (1965–1966). Tubes (often heavier than the foods they contained) were abandoned. Gelatin coatings helped to prevent bite-sized cubes from crumbling. Simpler rehydration methods were developed. The menus also expanded to include items such as shrimp cocktail, chicken and vegetables, toast squares, butterscotch pudding, and apple juice.&lt;ref name=FFSF/&gt;

The crew of [[Gemini III]] sneaked a [[corned beef sandwich]] on their spaceflight. Mission Commander [[Gus Grissom]] loved corned beef sandwiches, so Pilot [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] brought one along, having been encouraged by fellow astronaut [[Walter Schirra]]. However, Young was supposed to eat only approved food, and Grissom was not supposed to eat anything.

A congressional hearing was called, forcing the NASA deputy administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] to promise no repeats. NASA took special care about what astronauts brought along on future missions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/zorn/grissom.htm Detailed Biographies of Apollo I Crew - Gus Grissom] NASA.gov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceline.org/flightchron/gemini3.html Gemini III Fact Sheet] Spaceline.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, Gerard. ''Dark Side of the Moon: The Magnificent Madness of the American Lunar Quest''. (NYU Press, 2006), p.190&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Apollo program (1968–1975), early space food development was conducted at the US Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine and the [[Natick Army Labs]].&lt;ref name="Lane2002"/&gt; The variety of food options continued to expand for the [[Apollo program|Apollo missions]]. The new availability of hot water made rehydrating freeze-dried foods simpler, and produced a more appetizing result. The "spoon-bowl" allowed more normal eating practices. Food could be kept in special plastic zip-closure containers, and its moisture allowed it to stick to a spoon.&lt;ref name=FFSF/&gt;

===Apollo 11 (1969)===
On Sunday, 20 July 1969, [[Buzz Aldrin]], on the moon, partook of the Presbyterian Christian sacrament of [[Holy Communion]], which had been consecrated by his pastor, the Rev. Dean Woodruff, two weeks prior to the space mission.&lt;ref name="Alrdin1969"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.guideposts.org/better-living/life-advice/finding-life-purpose/guideposts-classics-buzz-aldrin-on-communion-in-space |title=Guideposts Classics: Buzz Aldrin on Communion in Space |publisher=[[Guideposts]] |first=Buzz |last=Aldrin |author-link=Buzz Aldrin |date=14 July 2014 |accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrin received the Eucharist in the same hour that his local church did on that Sunday Sabbath and he later stated that "I sensed especially strongly my unity with our church back home, and with the Church everywhere".&lt;ref name="Alrdin1969"/&gt;

===Skylab (1973–1974)===
[[File:S73-20236.jpg|thumb|Skylab 2 crew eats food during ground training]]

Larger living areas on the [[Skylab]] space station (1973–1974) allowed for an on-board refrigerator and freezer, which allowed perishable and frozen items to be stored and made microgravity the primary obstacle.&lt;ref name="livingandworking"/&gt;{{rp|142–144}} When Skylab's solar panels were damaged during its launch and the station had to rely on minimal power from the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] until [[Skylab 2]] crewmembers performed repairs, the refrigerator and freezer were among the systems that Mission Control kept operational.

Menus included 72 items; for the first time about 15% was frozen. Shrimp cocktail and butter cookies were consistent favorites; [[Lobster Newburg]], fresh bread,{{r|bourland20060407}} processed meat products, and ice cream were among other choices. A dining room table and chairs, fastened to the floor and fitted with foot and thigh restraints, allowed for a more normal eating experience. The trays used could warm the food, and had magnets to hold eating utensils and scissors used for opening food containers.&lt;ref name="livingandworking"&gt;Benson, Charles Dunlap and William David Compton.

After astronaut requests, NASA bought [[Paul Masson]] Rare [[Cream Sherry]] for one Skylab mission and packaged some for testing on a [[reduced gravity aircraft]]. In microgravity smells quickly permeate the environment and the agency found that the sherry triggered the [[gag reflex]]. Concern over public reaction to taking alcohol into space led NASA to abandon its plans, so astronauts drank the purchased supply while consuming their pre-mission special diet.&lt;ref name=bourland20060407&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/BourlandCT/BourlandCT_4-7-06.htm |title=Edited Oral History Transcript - Charles T.

The [[astronauts]] of the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] (1975) received samples of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space food when the combined crew dined together. Among the [[foods]] provided by [[Soyuz 19]] were [[canning|canned]] [[beef tongue]], [[packaging|packaged]] Riga [[bread]], and tubes of [[borscht]] (beet soup) and [[caviar]]. The borscht was labeled "[[vodka]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2000/00-53.html Former Astronaut Recalls Historic Apollo-Soyuz Mission] NASA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interkosmos (1978–1988)===
[[File:Bulgarian space food.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian space food]]

As part of the [[Interkosmos]] space program, allies of the Soviet Union have actively participated in the research and deployment of space technologies. The  Institute of Cryobiology and Lyophilization (now the Institute of Cryobiology and Food Technology), founded in 1973 as a part of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]], has since produced space food for the purposes of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ikht.bg/pages_eng/about_eng.html |title=About Us |publisher=Institute of Cryobiology and Food Technology |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MG__CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249 |title=Interkosmos: The Eastern Bloc's Early Space Program |publisher=Springer-Praxis |first1=Colin |last1=Burgess |first2=Bert |last2=Vis |page=249 |date=2016 |isbn=978-3-319-24161-6 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24163-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The menu includes traditional Bulgarian dishes such as [[tarator]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[moussaka|musaka]], [[ljutenica|lyutenitza]], [[yogurt|kiselo mlyako]], dried vegetables and fruits, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.24chasa.bg/Article/850353 |title=В Космоса: яденето българско, сексът руски |trans-title=In the Cosmos: Eating Bulgarian, Russian Sex |website=24chasa.bg |language=bg |first=Yaroslava |last=Prohazkova |date=9 April 2011 |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://delo.bg/world/balgariya-e-treta-v-sveta-po-proizvodstvo-na-hrana-za-kosmonavti/ |title=У нас е първата оранжерия за космическа храна в света |trans-title=In our country is the first greenhouse for space food in the world |website=Delo.bg |language=bg |first=Silvia |last=Vassileva |date=19 April 2015 |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern==
Today, fruits and vegetables that can be safely stored at room temperature are eaten on space flights. Astronauts also have a greater variety of [[main course]]s to choose from, and many request personalized menus from lists of available foods including items like fruit salad and spaghetti. Astronauts sometimes request [[jerky (food)|beef jerky]] for flights, as it is lightweight, calorie dense, and can be consumed in orbit without packaging or other changes.

==Processing==
[[File:Russian space food.jpg|thumb|Russian space food]]

Designing food for consumption in space is an often difficult process. Foods must meet a number of criteria to be considered fit for space. Firstly, the food must be [[Physiology|physiologically]] appropriate. Specifically, it must be nutritious, easily digestible, and palatable. Secondly, the food must be engineered for consumption in a zero gravity environment. As such, the food must be light, well packaged, fast to serve and require minimal cleaning up.  (Foods that tend to leave crumbs, for example, are ill-suited for space.) Finally, foods require a minimum of energy expenditure throughout their use; they must store well, open easily and leave little waste behind.

Carbonated drinks have been tried in space, but are not favored due to changes in belching caused by microgravity; without gravity to separate the liquid and gas in the stomach, burping results in a kind of vomiting called "wet burping".&lt;ref name=KloerisB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/people/journals/space/kloeris/05-01-01.html |title=Eating on the ISS |series=Field Journal |publisher=NASA |first=Vickie |last=Kloeris |date=May 1, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930025908/http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/people/journals/space/kloeris/05-01-01.html |archivedate=September 30, 2006 |quote=Because there is no gravity, the contents of your stomach float and tend to stay at the top of your stomach, under the rib cage and close to the valve at the top of your stomach. Because this valve isn't a complete closure (just a muscle that works with gravity), if you burp, it becomes a wet burp from the contents in your stomach.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] were first carried on [[STS-51-F]] in 1985. Coca-Cola has flown on subsequent missions in a specially designed dispenser that utilizes [[BioServe Space Technologies]] hardware used for biochemical experiments. [[Space Station Mir]] carried cans of Pepsi in 1996.

[[Beer]] has also been developed that counteracts the reduction of taste and smell reception in space and reduces the possibility of wet belches (vomiting caused by belching) in microgravity. Produced by Vostok 4-Pines Stout, a parabolic flight experiment validated that the reduced carbonation recipe met the criteria intended for space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.news.com.au/technology/vostok-beer-is-a-sturdy-stout-you-can-swig-in-space/news-story/d673d105eb1b255738de0fbbed316059 |title=How does space beer taste?

While not a space food (it used the same high carbonation 'Earth' recipe), the study did demonstrate that ingredients grown in space are safe for production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/12/barley-space-space-beer/ |title=Barley + Space = Space Beer! |work=Wired |first=Betsy |last=Mason |date=December 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Space bread has proved elusive because of a variety of challenges. By 2012 a method was suggested where dough is leavened by dissolved {{chem2|CO2}} (as opposed to yeast) and cooked by a low-temperature process. This could allow fresh baked bread from bulk ingredients on future spaceflights.&lt;ref name=daves&gt;{{cite news |url=https://newatlas.com/spacebread/22768/ |title=How to bake bread in space |work=New Atlas |first=David |last=Szondy |date=June 3, 2012 |accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Packaging==
[[File:Space shuttle eating tray.jpg|thumb|left|Food tray used aboard the [[Space Shuttle]]]]
Packaging for space food serves the primary purposes of preserving and containing the food. The packaging, however, must also be light-weight, easy to dispose of and useful in the preparation of the food for consumption. The packaging also includes a bar-coded label, which allows for the tracking of an astronaut's diet. The labels also specify the food's preparation instructions in both [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref name=KloerisB /&gt;

Many foods from the [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Russian space program]] are packaged in [[Tin can|can]]s and tins.&lt;ref name=bourlandC&gt;Bourland, Charles (2001) ''Packaging foods for flight''— NASA FTCSC News, July 2001&lt;/ref&gt; These are heated through [[Joule heating|electro-resistive (ohmic)]] methods, opened with a can-opener, and the food inside consumed directly. Russian soups are hydrated and consumed directly from their packages.&lt;ref name=luEd&gt;Lu, Edward (2003) ''Expedition 7: Eating at Cafe ISS'', Greetings Earthlings:Ed's musings from space, [http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/crew/exp7/luletters/lu_letter3.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trays include straps on the underside, allowing astronauts to attach the tray to an anchor point such as their legs or a wall surface and include clips for retaining a beverage pouch or utensils in the microgravity environment.

==Types==
[[File:ISSSpaceFoodsAssortment.jpg|thumb|Assortment of foods like those served aboard the ISS.]]
There are several classifications for food that is sent into space:&lt;ref name=FFSF&gt;{{cite web |author=NASA |accessdate=2006-12-12 |date=2002-04-07 |title=Food For Space Flight |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/factsheets/food.html |work=Fact Sheet Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA HRP"&gt;{{cite book |title=Human health and performance risks of space exploration missions : evidence reviewed by the NASA Human Research Program |date=2009 |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center |location=Johnson Space Center, Houston |isbn=978-0160846342 |pages=4–5 |url=http://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/evidence/reports/Food.pdf |author=Perchonok, M |author2=Douglas, G |author3=Cooper, M |editor=McPhee, J |editor2=Charles, J |chapter=Risk of Performance Decrement and Crew Illness Due to an Inadequate Food System}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Beverages (B)'' - Freeze dried drink mixes (coffee or tea) or flavored drinks (lemonade or orange drink) are provided in vacuum sealed beverage pouches. Coffee and tea may have powdered cream and/or sugar added depending on personal taste preferences. Empty beverage pouches are provided for drinking water.
*''Fresh Foods (FF)''- Fresh fruit, vegetables and tortillas delivered by resupply missions. These foods spoil quickly and need to be eaten within the first two days of flight to prevent spoilage. These foods are provided as psychological support.
*''Irradiated (I) Meat'' - Beef steak that is sterilized with ionizing radiation to keep the food from spoiling. NASA has dispensation from the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) to use this type of food sterilization.
*''Intermediate Moisture (IM)'' - Foods that have some moisture but not enough to cause immediate spoilage.
*''Natural Form (NF)'' - Commercially available, [[Shelf stable|shelf-stable]] foods such as nuts, cookies and granola bars that are ready to eat.
*''Rehydratable (R) Foods'' - Foods that have been dehydrated by various technologies (such as drying with heat, osmotic drying and freeze drying) and allowed to rehydrate in hot water prior to consumption. Reducing the water content reduces the ability of microorganisms to thrive.
*''Thermostabilized (T)'' - Also known as the retort process. This process heats foods to destroy [[pathogens]], [[microorganisms]] and [[enzymes]] that may cause [[Food spoilage|spoilage]].
*''Extended shelf-life bread products'' - Scones, waffles and rolls specially formulated to have a shelf life of up to 18 months.

More common staples and condiments do not have a classification and are known simply by the item name:
* ''Shelf Stable Tortillas'' - Tortillas that have been heat treated and specially packaged in an [[oxygen]]-free [[nitrogen]] atmosphere to prevent the growth of mold.
* ''Condiments'' - Liquid salt solution, oily pepper paste, mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard.

==Consumer derivatives==
Capitalizing on the popularity of the Apollo space missions, [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] marketed "Food Sticks" (also known as "[[Space Food Sticks]]") for the consumer market in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Space Food Sticks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacefoodsticks.com/pres.html |title=Space Food Sticks |accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen individually packaged sticks were included in a box, and came in six flavors such as peanut butter, caramel, and chocolate. Food Sticks were marketed as a "nutritionally balanced between meal snack".

Most of these products can now be found in NASA Space Center gift shops, general novelty shops or at Army Surplus stores. A popular example is [[freeze-dried ice cream]]. Campers have taken to using products such as Tang due to their reliability, but some others, such as many of the freeze dried foods, contain fragrances that can attract bears, cougars, and other forest animals.

[[Tang (drink)|Tang]], originally marketed in 1959, also saw an increase in popularity during this era due to its inclusion on the manned space flights.

The human race is no longer confined to simply their home planet of Earth, and have spread out among the galaxy. Originally this was done using vast [[Generation ship|"Generation" spacecraft]] which took generations (as their name implies) to reach their destination. However, after the Generation ships were 'rescued' by the Ildirans, all spaceships quickly adapted to their far superior [[Technology of The Saga of Seven Suns#Energy source|ekti]]-driven stardrives. There are three main factions among the humans.

===Terran Hanseatic League (Hansa)===

The Terran Hanseatic League, known as the Hansa, control most of humanity's planets. They are an extensive commerce-based federation in control of Earth and most Terran colonies. They have a [[puppet king]], who is more for show than anything else. The real power lies with the Chairman of the Hansa, who controls the king. They have trade relations with the Ildirans, who gave them the original Ildiran stardrive. Their military is the Earth Defense Forces, also known as the EDF. Their main religion is Unison, the head of which is the Archfather. They use compies, short for competent computerized companion. Compies are intelligent servant robots available in Friendly, Teacher, Governess, Listener, Analytical and other models. This is an interstellar version of the [[Hanseatic League]] which existed in northern Europe from the 13th through the 17th centuries.

===Roamers===

The Roamers originated from the Kanaka, the last of the eleven generation ships to leave Earth. Originally intended to arrive on a planet and become colonists, they instead became the Roamers. This was brought about soon after the Ildirans brought their ancestors to the fertile planet, Iawa; during their first major harvest, the colonists' crops were all but annihilated by a virus that attacked Terran-based plant life. With their food reserves rapidly dwindling, the people decided to take their chances in space (where they had thrived), and so they all boarded the still intact Kanaka and set out into the vast galaxy once again. Eventually they re-established contact with the people they had left at the Meyer rubble belt, and all banded together to find a new way of life amongst the stars.

Roamers are well known for their fierce independence, as well as their highly innovative (though somewhat dangerous) methods. They are normally referred to as 'Space Gypsies' or 'Roachers'. The Hansa do not think well of them, though they are required to trade with them for ekti, a vital stardrive fuel. This is one of their main sources of income. The Roamers use skymines, ekti-harvesting and processing facilities located in gas giant clouds, to acquire this fuel. They are the main source of ekti for both the Hansa and Ildiran Empire, though they do not have much trade with the Ildirans. They have next to no military force, relying mainly on secrecy to ensure their safety. The Roamer society is split up into multiple clans, their leader being a Speaker. Their 'capital' is at Rendezvous, a site which is kept very secret. They are extremely adaptable and can adjust their equipment and lifestyle to suit various harsh conditions. They rely on others for assistance, products, etc. as little as possible.

===Therons===

The Therons originated from the Caillié, fifth of the generation ships to depart Earth and first to be encountered by the Ildirans. The colonists of this ship were taken by the Ildirans to settle on Theroc. Their rulers are a Father and Mother, similar to a King and Queen. They live mainly on biological products, using next to no inorganic materials. The Therons have the capability of bonding with the worldforest (or [[#verdani|verdani]]) to become green priests, who have telepathic relationships with the worldforest. They are, strictly speaking, independent of the Hansa. They have next to no military initially, although their alliance with the Verdani does give them protection to a certain degree. Following the centralization of the Confederation on their world however leads the Confederation Defense Force to protect the planet in addition to Verdani spacecraft.

===The Confederation===

Formed by King Peter and Queen Estarra of the Hansa. The Confederation consists of Roamers, Therons and some former Hansa Colonies. The capital of The Confederation is on Theroc.

The Confederation was formed as an alternative to the increasingly oppressive Hansa, and as a response to the increasingly delusional Chairman of the Hanseatic League. Its incorporation of independent states such as the Roamers and Therons hints at a Federal nature, with a King hinting at some form of Monarchy, constitutional or otherwise.

Its military is formed from a number of EDF (Earth Defence Force) ships that mutinied against the Hansa, and Roamer vessels outfitted with weaponry. Eventually the remaining 33 ships of the EDF and the 11 EDF ships of the Confederacy merged under the command of Fleet Admiral Sheila Willis. The Confederation is officially allied with the Ildiran Empire.

After the assassination of Chairman Wenceslas and the dissolution of the Hanseatic League, the Confederacy incorporated all of Humanity and its widespread colonies, including Earth.

The Confederation's structure of governance relies upon individual governments for each planet, appropriately maintaining each planet while a central overhead Government oversees interstellar relations upon which the King and Queen monitor while still maintaining authority. Theroc is heart of the Confederation and is protected by the native Verdani.

==Ildirans==

The Ildirans are a [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species ruled by the quasi-mystical Mage-Imperator, via an empathic link called the ''thism''. The thism links all Ildirans to their leader, who is in turn linked to the Lightsource, a warm, gentle communal light which brings peace and prosperity. The Lightsource may be considered an ancient alien race allied with the Ildirans, or their afterlife; descriptions vary throughout the series. Lens kithmen are able to focus the thism to touch each Ildiran. Traditionally the first born noble pure blood son of the previous Mage-Imperator, known as the Prime Designate, undergoes a ritual castration which will allow him to become the focal point for Thism. When a Mage-Imperator is killed, all members of the Ildiran race are cut off from the Lightsource. As Ildrians have a natural fear of the dark, it is urgent that they establish a new Mage-Imperator. All Ildrians can also feel when a Designate (son of the Mage-Imperator) or Designate-In-Waiting (son of new Mage-Imperator) dies, though they are less affected by it. An example of this is in Book Two, when Mage-Imperator Cyroc'h poisons himself, or in Book Three, when Designate-In-Waiting Pery'h is murdered on the orders of his corrupt uncle Rusa'h.

Socially, the Ildiran are separated into [[caste]]s (kiths), according to their dominant genetic traits. They vary widely, some seeming to cross the species gap by being nearly reptilian or avian. Most, especially the noble kith, are similar to baseline humans, with a pale golden or gray skin. Each Ildiran ends its name with a different sound to indicate kith; cross-breeds combine the sounds:
* 'h   rulers/nobles
* 'n   soldiers/warriors/guards
* 'nh  military leaders/generals
* 'k   workers
* 'v   bureaucrats
* 't   singers
* 'l   lens kithmen
* 'f   scientists
* 'o   technicians
* 'of  engineers
* 'a   teachers
* 'th  artists
* 'sh  rememberers
* 'x   miners
* 'c scalies
* l swimmers

Ildirans are a stagnant race, mired in ritual and protocol, uninterested in expansion and content with the past glories described in their epic poem, the Saga of Seven Suns. The Saga of Seven Suns supposedly records every significant event in their history, and the task of retelling this epic is given to the rememberers. They are dependent on their thism-link with other Ildirans, so much so that isolation from other Ildirans can drive them into madness. The Ildirans invented the Ildiran stardrive, which uses [[ekti]], an [[allotrope]] of hydrogen found mainly in gas giants, to quickly travel great distances. It is the only viable form of interstellar travel.

==Klikiss==

The Klikiss are an insectoid race that were thought to have become extinct 10,000 years before the beginning of the series. Their only remains are numerous ruins (some more or less intact, whilst others are wrecked beyond repair) scattered amongst worlds across the Spiral Arm. It is later discovered that some of the Klikiss' technology is still salvageable, as proven by the use of the Klikiss Torch and the inter-planetary portals found in a large number of their cities.

Aside from this, the only other legacy left behind by the Klikiss race is the large number of [[Klikiss robots]] (apparently designed in their likeness) that were reactivated half a millennia ago by the Ildirans. The robots themselves are very intricate in terms of design, with largely unknown inner workings. Though they all look identical, they each consider themselves unique in some respect, as they assign names to each member of their race. They have blunt speech mannerisms, and often do not reveal much about themselves or their motives.

The cause for the Klikiss' disappearance is a mystery to the rest of the galaxy, and the [[Artificial intelligence|intelligent]] robots claim to have no knowledge of the events. Thus the dead race provides a very complex mystery, one which the human race has tried to unravel by studying the Klikiss ruins.

In reality, they were wiped out by the Hydrogues (in a deal with the Klikiss robots in exchange for Transportal technology), their robots (which turned on them) and the Ildirans, who did so to avoid being wiped out by the Hydrogues. A large number of them were killed instantaneously by passing through Transportals reprogrammed by their robots to send them to the cores of gas giants inhabited by the Hydrogues. The surviving robots are free to roam around the galaxy, but their purpose is dubious. The Ildirans do not have many dealings with them, although the Klikiss robots acted as negotiators between them and the Hydrogues, and some humans are wary of them. Although it appears that only a few of them survived, the 'awakened' ones are reviving their dormant comrades. They are allied with the Hydrogues, and are at war against Humanity in order to free their servant robots ("compies") - a reason why the Ildirans do not use similar technology.

A number of Klikiss evidently survived the genocide, as they reappear (in droves) on the planet Llaro at the end of ''[[Of Fire and Night]]'', ready to take revenge on their traitorous robots and reclaim their old worlds, now colonized by the Hansa. In the 6th book - "Metal Swarm" - it is revealed that there are still thousands of Klikiss left which are divided into hives each ruled by a Breedex (like a queen bee in a bee hive). They live as a [[Eusocial]] society, all connected by a telepathic "[[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]]" centred around the Breedex, similar to how the ''thism'' of Ildirans is centred round the Mage-Imperator, however it is more complex due to the fact no Klikiss on its own is sentient apart from the Breedex, and therefore Breedex has total control over the Klikiss minds. The Klikiss reproduce by absorbing organic matter and DNA from any living creature and incorporating it into newbreeds such as humans.

==Elemental races==

===Hydrogues===

Little is known about the hydrogues. They are a highly aggressive, mercuric lifeform residing in the centres of gas giants and appear to lack emotions, being somewhat robotic in this sense. Hydrogues have the ability to alter their malleable forms, though they only tend to do this when communicating with other races (or "rock-dwellers"). They possess incredibly devastating weaponry (icewaves and powerful electrical blasts), and have no regard for the human race or Ildirans. They reappeared after the humans ignited the [[gas giant]] Oncier, which they inhabited, and began to destroy all human and Ildiran facilities, not appearing to distinguish between human factions, or even the two races. Their ships are spherical, heavily armoured (seemingly made out of diamond), and possess a great deal of firepower. They can completely destroy small celestial bodies within a day, and even extinguish stars. They represent the "[[Air (classical element)|air]]" aspect of the four [[classical elements|elemental]] powers. During books 2-5 the Hydrogues were largely at war with the turncoat faeros, however the Klikiss Torch frequently deployed by the EDF forced their attention elsewhere. They are also at war with the Verdani (worldforest) and wentals. However the hydrogues beaten into submission by the combined attacks of the EDF, Ildrian Solar Navy, Verdani Battleships and the Roamers at the Battle for Earth in book 5.

Following the end of the war the Hydrogues allow the use of Gas Giants for human purpose and even warn human presences of planetary threats.

===Faeros===

Faeros are fiery entities that dwell within suns, and are seemingly unaffected by the hazardous temperatures. They are considered to be treacherous by the Verdani. They once fought with the Verdani and Wentals against the Hydrogues, but then shifted alliances (for reasons relating to the Klikiss robots). In the ongoing war, they appear to have shifted alliances again, attacking the Hydrogues while sparing the other races. They represent the "[[Fire (classical element)|fire]]" aspect of the four elemental powers.

It is suggested in ''Scattered Suns'' that the faeros may be the "Lightsource" from which the Ildiran ''thism'' is derived. This is expanded in ''Of Fire and Night'', in which the pretender to the Imperial Throne, Rusa'h, appears to be linked with the faeros, possibly in a similar manner to Jess Tamblynn and the wentals, or Beneto and the verdani. Also during the fifth book, a hydrogue emissary unknowingly hints that the Ildirans and faeros were once allies; later in the book, it seems that this bond (should the records be believed) was formed to drive off the evil Shana-Rei. When the Ildrians discover a dark nebulae the Faeros are actively afraid.

===&lt;span id="Verdani"&gt;Verdani&lt;/span&gt;===

Also referred to as the "Worldforest", this race manifests itself as a telepathic network of trees that some humans (the Green Priests) can communicate with. Once the Verdani were present on thousands of worlds across the galaxy, but the conflict with the Hydrogues forced them to near-extinction. Losing the war has seemingly caused the Verdani to lose much of their combat resolve, as the mere thought of engaging a Hydrogue terrifies them.

Currently the largest concentration of Verdani reside on the planet Theroc, although they have started to be spread around the galaxy again with the aid of humans. They demonstrate the ability to absorb information like a sponge and store it eternally for later use by either themselves or other beings. This makes their thirst for new knowledge, whatever it may be, practically insatiable. Green priests are able to use Verdani as instant communication devices, sending any message across vast distances almost immediately. Although the Verdani are made up of many trees, they manifest themselves as one being. They represent the "earth" aspect of the four elemental powers.

Green priests have the ability to become part of the world-forest's mind upon their death, if they have time and ability to pour their souls into a tree as they die. The verdani are then capable of building a golem from one of these "ghosts", as they did with Beneto.

With the addition of wental water, the verdani are capable of producing "treeships", vast trees capable of interstellar flight, and able to destroy hydrogue warglobes with apparent ease. Each treeship requires a green priest joined in a permanent symbiosis to act as a pilot / navigator; such ships had been produced for the last war, ten millennia ago, piloted by a now-forgotten race of bird-like humanoids. These ships were sent into deep space, and returned to Theroc at the end of ''Scattered Suns''. An additional hundred were built during ''Of Fire and Night''. These large treeships are used to defend Theroc from orbit after the war.

===Wentals===

A water-based race who were considered extinct for 10,000 years after the war with the faeros/hydrogues, but in fact were broken up and dispersed throughout the [[Interstellar medium|interstellar void]]. Whilst wentals are unable to die, they can be "disassociated" into their more basic components, nullifying their sentience and thus putting them in a form of suspended animation. Like the verdani, they have some kind of telepathic link and speak as one.

However, Jess Tamblyn accidentally collects wental essence while gathering water during a solitary deep-space mission. Because of this, the wentals are effectively brought back to life. They establish a telepathic link with him, telling him about the intergalactic war that took place millennia ago. Jess takes the wentals to an uninhabited oceanic planet and introduces them into the raging sea, initializing the first phase of the race's rebirth. They have the ability to take control of any water-based body (e.g. planets, comets) and control it, regardless of the state of the water. They can then manipulate the climate and lifeforms of the planet, and this is how they reproduce. They represent the "[[Water (classical element)|water]]" aspect of the four elemental powers.

Though wentals are not hostile in nature, some aspects of their essence (under certain circumstances) can become 'tainted' due to strong selfish desires of their hosts. When trying to save Cesca from her excessive wounds, the wentals informed Jess of how tainted wentals had been formed in the past and caused great destruction. Fortunately, tainted wentals cannot propagate, but are eternally enraged by everything around them. They seek to replace order with chaos (what they feel is the 'Natural order') and thus attack all those around them. Tainted wentals can either be destroyed by killing the host body, or extracting the tainted essence and purifying it (a process which also kills the host). Karla Tamblyn became a Tainted Wental after Jess recovered her frozen body from within the ice of [[Plumas (Saga of Seven Suns)|Plumas]] where she had died many years before. She was reanimated by tainted wental energy and almost completely destroyed the Clan Tamblyn homestead and water mines before Jess and the newly imbued Cesca returned and saved them.

==Other races==

===Shana Rei===
The Shana Rei are an ancient, demonic and powerful race who personify darkness and chaos. Eons before the events of ''[[Hidden Empire (Anderson novel)|Hidden Empire]]'' (2002), they had battled the Ildirans and were eventually defeated with light-based weapons and an Ildiran alliance with the faeros. The Shana Rei are said to be the primary reason why Ildirans are afraid of the dark. In ''[[Scattered Suns]]'' (2005) it is discovered that parts of the Ildiran ''Saga of Seven Suns'' have been falsified, and the possibility arises that the Shana Rei might never have actually existed. More evidence emerges that they did in fact exist in ''[[Of Fire and Night]]'' (2006).

The Shana Rei reappear in the universe in ''[[The Dark Between the Stars]]'' (2014), awakened by another, unidentified universal power that is also arising after a long sleep. Hidden in the spaces behind our own universe, the Shana Rei resemble [[dark nebulae]] when they materialize in space. Disrupted by the deafening noise of life and creation, they hope to destroy all sentient life and return the universe to quiet emptiness and chaos. They trap the remaining Klikiss robots, and the robot leader [[Exxos (Saga of Shadows)|Exxos]] convinces the Shana Rei to let his robots help in their plans. The Shana Rei and Klikiss robots begin attacking human and Ildiran warships, colonies and planets.&lt;ref name="Dark Between"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rwjHAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dark+between+stars+anderson&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q=dark%20between%20stars%20anderson&amp;f=false |title=The Dark Between the Stars |first=Kevin J. |last=Anderson |authorlink=Kevin J Anderson |isbn=978-0765332998 |year=2014 |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Onthos===
A forgotten race who, long before the events of ''Hidden Empire'' (2002), had been hunted and extinguished by the Klikiss. In ''The Dark Between the Stars'' (2014), the [[Roamer (Saga of Seven Suns)|Roamer]] Clan Reeves discovers and settles on an abandoned city in space which turns out to be formerly inhabited by a surviving group of the Onthos. They had been decimated by a Klikiss plague, however, and though they died out centuries or even millennia before, the human settlers are soon infected and killed themselves. Not long after, 99 spaceships appear at [[Theroc]], containing another small group of Onthos. As the aliens touch the worldtrees, the [[verdani]] mind is reminded that the Onthos were once their caretakers long before humans, when the worldforest had originated on a different planet.&lt;ref name="Dark Between"/&gt;

==Animals==

===Condorflies===

A Condorfly is a fictional extraterrestrial insect which looks somewhat like a [[butterfly]] but is much larger, about the size of a dinner plate, roughly. Condorflies are unintelligent and very short-lived. Their bodies decompose fast after death leaving only their beautiful wings behind. They are only found on Theroc, and are often the pets of small children, kept on a long string to keep them from flying away.

Also, while appearing unintelligent one Condorfly, the pet of the Theron Mother and Father youngest child, Celli, was released into the wilderness to mate before it died, but it dutifully returned to her bed while she slept, seemingly to be with her one last time.

===Chrome flies===

Shiny silver insects that live on Theroc.

===Furry crickets===

Furry crickets are unintelligent and are about the size of a [[rabbit]], covered in fur and have long legs and antenna like a [[cricket]]. They are only found on Corribus. Furry crickets are portrayed as being readily tamed and affectionate despite appearing to be the primary prey animal for the known local predators. They are edible by humans even though they apparently don't taste very good.

===Lowriders===

Lowriders are carnivorous, crustaceans from the klikiss world of Corribus. They are described as having five eyes, a flattened spherical centre body and clockwork jaws. They live on furry cricket and flying creatures. They are noted as able to easily tear through bone and flesh.

===Medusas===

These [[Nautilus]]/[[Snail]] like creatures are native to the sea world [[Rhejak]] and are so named for their numerous snakelike tentacles. They have two pairs of eyes, one pair for seeing above water and the other for below. Fully grown, they have shells the size of large rooms, and [[Planets of 'Saga of the Seven Suns'#Rhejak|Rhejak]] natives use these shells as such, hollowing them out and connecting them together to make houses. Sometimes adolescents will ride these Medusas and get them to fight one another as entertainment. They also have edible meat described by Admiral Sheila Willis as having a rubbery texture "like baked mushrooms" and a strong flavour "reminiscent of lobster".

===Nematodes===

A species of giant [[annelid]] with scarlet bodies and diamond chipped teeth, originating on Plumas. When Karla Tamblyn is reanimated by a tainted wental, she induces the nematodes to attack the water mine workers there.

===Isix cats===

Isix cats are feline predators from the planet Ildira. They are quite deadly and, if they can be tamed, make exceptional guards. Yazra'h uses trained cats in her body guard duties. There were three of them originally before one was killed.

===Ch'kanh===

A species of anemone native to Maratha. Ch'kanh have strong armoured crusts, which gives them their name ("ch'kanh" means "living fortresses" in Ildiran). Ch'kanh also have very sharp "teeth", which allow them to eat other creatures.

===Shadow lions===

Shadow lions live on the planet Maratha. Their fur absorbs all light so they are extremely difficult to see at night. They can 'see' heat, due to their ability to perceive the infra-red spectrum and follow it to catch their prey. In the dark, Ildirans separated from other Ildirans often mistake these creatures for the Shana Rei. They are ruthless carnivores which demonstrate no fear.

'''Storge''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɔːr|ɡ|i}},&lt;ref name=collins&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/storge Collins English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Ancient Greek]] word στοργή ''storgē''&lt;ref&gt;Walter Hooper, ''C. S. Lewis: A Companion &amp; Guide'' (1996) p. 369-70&lt;/ref&gt;) or '''familial love''' refers to natural or instinctual affection,&lt;ref name=collins /&gt;&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Strong B, Yarber WL, Sayad BW, Devault C |title=Human sexuality: diversity in contemporary America |edition=6th |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location= New York |year=2008 |page=228 |isbn=978-0-07-312911-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the love of a parent towards offspring and vice versa.

In social psychology, another term for love between good friends is ''[[philia]]''.&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt;

== Extensiveness ==
Storge is a wide-ranging force which can apply between family members, friends, pets and owners, companions or colleagues; it can also blend with and help underpin other types of tie such as passionate love or friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus storge may be used as a general term to describe the love between exceptional friends, and the desire for them to care compassionately for one another.&lt;ref&gt;B. Strong et al., ''The Marriage and Family Experience'' (2010) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storge love ==
Sometimes the term is used to refer to the love between married partners who are committed and plan to have a long relationship together, particularly as a fundamental relational foundation after initial [[infatuation]] (limerence)

Another interpretation for storge is to be used to describe a sexual relationship between two people that gradually grew out of a friendship&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt;—storgic lovers sometimes cannot pinpoint the moment that friendship turned to love.&lt;ref&gt;''Family Experience'' p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Storgic lovers are friends first, and the friendship, and the storge, can endure even beyond the breakup of the sexual relationship.&lt;ref name="Strong" /&gt; They want their significant others to also be their best friends, and will choose their mates based on similar goals and interests—[[Homogamy (sociology)|homogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Gottschalk, ''How to Heal After Heartbreak'' (2013) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Storgic lovers place much importance on commitment, and find that their motivation to avoid committing [[infidelity]] is to preserve the trust between the two partners.  Children and marriage are seen as legitimate long-term aims for their bond,&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Greenberg, ''Empowering Health Decisions'' (2013) p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; while passionate sexual intensity is of lesser importance than in other love styles.&lt;ref&gt;Gottschalk, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
Advantages of storgic love may be the level of how one loves their family and understands each other. In addition, two people who are deeply devoted to one another can feel the intimacy that they share.

The main disadvantages of storgic love may be the large time investment and the loss of that investment if the friendship ends{{Citation needed|reason=Other sources claim that since other forms of love can evolve into Storge, Storge can evolve into other forms of love. Also the description of Storge in terms of investment, demanding a return on investment as integral part of evaluation, is entirely subjective and opinionable rather than factful.|date=July 2018}}.

==Underreporting==
The rate of suicide in Nepal has been reported to be as low as 3.7/100,000 as a result of under reporting caused by issues of legality, social stigma, and logistical problems.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2777576/pdf/MHFM-05-177.pdf|title = Suicide prevention in Nepal: a comparison to Australia – a personal view|journal=[[Mental Health in Family Medicine]]|date = 2008|accessdate=29 June 2015|pmc=2777576|pmid=22477866|volume=5|pages=177–82 | last1 = Benson | first1 = J | last2 = Shakya | first2 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suicide is illegal in Nepal and is punishable by fines and imprisonment. According to the director of Samanta, a Nepalese organization for women’s rights, "most families will never report suicide cases as they are afraid of being entangled in police cases."&lt;ref name="Irin News"/&gt; In attempts to avoid legal trouble, suicidal patients and their families may avoid going to hospitals for treatment. Even after death, victims of suicide may have their deaths misattributed to avoid legal problems for their families.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

Families may also avoid reporting suicides due to social stigma and discrimination against people with mental health problems.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; Despite the recent abundance of articles discussing suicide in Nepal, issues related to suicide are largely avoided, both as the result and perpetuation of a powerful social stigma against mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540260310001635186|title = Nepal mental health country profile|publisher=[[International Review of Psychiatry]]|date = 2004|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For women in particular, the under reporting of suicides and suicide-attempts may be caused in part by a "culture of silence", especially in cases related to domestic abuse.&lt;ref name="Peace Voice"&gt;{{cite web |url = 
http://www.peacevoice.info/2013/08/30/female-suicides-in-nepal%E2%80%95and-in-the-usa/|title = Female Suicides in Nepal and in the USA|publisher=[[Peace Voice]]|date = 30 August 2013|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, logistical issues pose a threat to accurate reporting and record keeping. According to the Nepal Health Sector Support Programme, due to "poor record keeping by police and hospitals" as well as the fact that "registration systems are inaccurate and of poor quality," suicide may continue to be under reported even if social and legal issues were to be resolved.&lt;ref name="SUICIDE AMONG WOMEN IN NEPAL"/&gt;

==Gender==
In 2009, the Nepalese Family Health Division's Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Study published the "shocking finding" that suicide was the leading cause of death for women of reproductive age (15-49). According to the report, "analysis of verbal autopsy data indicates mental health problems, relationships, marriage and family issues are key factors" with 21% of suicides among women of reproductive age consisting of women 18 or younger, "indicating that youth is a factor to be investigated." &lt;ref name="Family Health Division"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dpiap.org/resources/pdf/nepal_maternal_mortality_2011_04_22.pdf|title=Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Study|publisher=[[Family Health Division]] |year=2009|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the suicide rate for men remains higher almost universally as well as in Nepal (30.1/100,000 for men, 20.0/100,000 for women),&lt;ref name="Suicide rates Data by country"/&gt; Nepal has a relatively high ratio of female:male suicides and stands out as being ranked 17th for male suicide rates but 3rd for female suicide rates. It's worth noting that while male suicide rates are higher, it is estimated that Nepalese women attempt suicide three times more than men do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/09/10/top-story/youth-more-prone-to-suicide/212596/ |title=Youth more prone to suicide |publisher=[[Kathmandu Post]] |date = 11 September 2010|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the tie ins to maternal health, domestic violence, and youth have made female suicide a prominent issue. A case study published in the same mortality report exemplifies the type of problems that women may face:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sanju was a 21 years old, illiterate and mother of two children. By her third pregnancy she was anaemic and malnourished, feeling dizzy and weak, but she received no antenatal care. In her third month of pregnancy she was about to travel to her maternal home with her husband, but her relatives stopped her as there was a flood. She went to her room to rest, but when her mother-in-law went to her room an hour later she said she had eaten some medicine for killing lice. Her husband, mother-in-law and neighbour took her to the local medicine shop in their cart, and the pharmacist immediately referred her to the district hospital. The family borrowed money and took her to hospital in a private van, a 25 minute journey. She was admitted to the emergency ward and attended to by the doctor immediately, but died within a few hours. The above account was given by her mother-in-law. However, the female community health volunteer said Sanju suffered from hysteria and was being forced to have an illicit relationship with her father-in-law. She was treated for her hysteria but forced to continue the relationship, and therefore was tense. The FCHV and VHW felt this may have been the reason she committed suicide.&lt;ref name="Family Health Division"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More indirectly, gender based inequality in Nepal has been suggested as the cause of female suicide in Nepal. The prominence of suicide among women of reproductive age may be as a result of unwanted pregnancies and early marriages.&lt;ref name="Peace Voice"/&gt; For Nepalese women, being married can come with the cost of leaving one's family and friends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/a-silent-killer-of-women-suicide/|title = A Silent Killer of Women — Suicide|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date = 6 March 2014|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a "perennial cycle of dependence, which may lead some to view suicide as their only option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nhssp.org.np/gesi/Suicide%20among%20women%20in%20Nepal%20Final.pdf|title = A review of the evidence: suicide among women in Nepal|publisher = [[Nepal Health Sector Support Programme]]|accessdate = 29 June 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150608063731/http://www.nhssp.org.np/gesi/Suicide%20among%20women%20in%20Nepal%20Final.pdf|archivedate = 8 June 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3306">A '''true threat''' is a [[threatening communication]] that can be prosecuted under the law. It is distinct from a threat that is made in jest. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has held that true threats are not protected under the [[U.S. Constitution]] based on three justifications: preventing fear, preventing the disruption that follows from that fear, and diminishing the likelihood that the threatened violence will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=81|publisher=N.Y.U. L. Rev.|pages=385|year=2006|title=Toward an Improved True Threat Doctrine for Student Speakers; Stanner, Andrew P.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/nylr81&amp;section=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some concern that even satirical speech could be regarded as a "true threat" due to concern over [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=58|publisher=U. Miami L. Rev.|pages=843|date=2003–2004|title=Mocking George: Political Satire as True Threat in the Age of Global Terrorism|author=Gilbert, Lauren|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/umialr58&amp;section=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The true threat doctrine was established in the 1969 Supreme Court case ''[[Watts v. United States]]''.&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{citation|volume=72|publisher=Fordham L. Rev.|pages=1283|year=2004|title=Is the True Threats Doctrine Threatening the First Amendment? Planned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette, Inc. v. American Coalition of Life Activists Signals the Need To Remedy an Inadequate Doctrine; Weiss, Lori|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3953&amp;context=flr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, an eighteen-year-old male was convicted in a Washington, D.C. District Court for violating a statute prohibiting persons from knowingly and willfully making threats to harm or kill the President of the United States.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; The conviction was based on a statement made by Watts, in which he said, "[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is [[Lyndon B. Johnson|L.B.J.]]"&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Watts appealed, leading to the Supreme Court finding the statute constitutional on its face, but reversing the conviction of Watts. 

In reviewing the lower court's analysis of the case, the Court noted that "a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech."&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; The Court recognized that "uninhibited, robust, and wideopen" political debate can at times be characterized by "vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials." In light of the context of Watts' statement - and the laughter that it received from the crowd - the Court found that it was more "a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President" than a "true threat." &lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; In so holding, the Court established that there is a "true threat" exception to protected speech, but also that the statement must be viewed in its context and distinguished from protected hyperbole. The opinion, however, stopped short of defining precisely what constituted a "true threat." &lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7293">[[Image:1stBaronBlakeney.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lord Blakeney]]

Lieutenant-General '''William Blakeney, 1st Baron Blakeney''' [[Order of the Bath|KB]] (1671/1672{{snd}}10 September 1761) was an [[Kingdom of Ireland|Irish]] soldier known for [[Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)|his unsuccessful defence]] of the Spanish island of [[Menorca]] following the [[Battle of Menorca (1756)|Battle of Menorca in 1756]].

==Early life==
Blakeney was born at Mount Blakeney, [[County Limerick]], to William Blakeley, a member of the [[Irish House of Commons]] for [[Kilmallock (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Kilmallock]], and Elizabeth (née Bowerman).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p13096.htm#i130958 Profile at thepeerage.com for Lt.-Gen. William Blakeney, 1st and last Baron Blakeney of Castle Blakeney]&lt;/ref&gt;

Destined for politics, he showed a decided preference for a military career. At age 18, he headed the tenants in defending the Blakeney estate against the [[Rapparee]]s. As a volunteer he fought the [[War of the Spanish Succession|war in Flanders]], and at the [[Siege of Venlo (1702)|Siege of Venlo]] in 1702 won his commission.
He served as a [[subaltern (rank)|subaltern]] throughout [[duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]]'s campaigns, and is said to have been the first to drill troops by signal of drum or colour.
Between  1725 and 1757, he represented [[Kilmallock (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Kilmallock]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Blakeney, William Blakeney |volume=4 |page=38 }} This cites ''Memoirs of General William Blakeney'' (1757).&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years after the [[peace of Utrecht]] he served unnoticed, and was 65 years of age before he became a colonel. This neglect, which was said to be due to the hostility of [[Ralph Verney, 1st Earl Verney|Lord Verney]], ceased when the [[Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]] was appointed colonel of Blakeney's regiment, and thenceforward his advance was rapid.
Brigadier-general in the [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] expedition of 1741, and major-general a little later, he distinguished himself by his gallant and successful [[Siege of Stirling Castle (1746)|defence of Stirling Castle]] against the Highlanders in 1745.
Two years later [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] made him lieutenant-general and lieutenant-governor of [[Menorca]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Fall of Menorca==
{{Main|Siege of Fort St Philip (1756)}}
[[File:Prise du fort Saint Philippe a Minorque 1756.jpg|thumb|The siege of Fort St. Philip in Menorca. April to June 1756.]]
The governor of that island never set foot in it, and Blakeney was left in command for ten years.
In 1756 the [[Seven Years' War]] was preluded by a swift descent of the French on Menorca. Fifteen thousand troops under marshal the [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|duc de Richelieu]], escorted by a strong squadron under the [[marquis de la Gallisonnière]], landed on the island on 18 April, and at once began the siege, where Blakeney commanded at most some 5,000 soldiers and workmen.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;!--EB1911 clearly says 5000; an editor on 21 Oct 2010 had introduced 2000 --&gt;

The defence, in spite of crumbling walls and rotted gun platforms, had already lasted a month when a weak, undersupplied British fleet under Vice-admiral [[John Byng]] appeared.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; La Gallisonnière and Byng fought, on 20 May, an [[Battle of Menorca (1756)|indecisive battle]]. Byng left Blakeney to his fate after his fleet lost over 400 men. Byng sailed for the nearest port repair facilities in the Mediterranean, that being [[Gibraltar]], where he hoped to repair his fleet for a return.

A second expedition subsequently appeared off Menorca, but it was then too late, for after a heroic resistance of seventy-one days the old general had been compelled to surrender the fort to Richelieu (18 April{{snd}}28 June 1756). Only the ruined fortifications were the prize of the victors. Blakeney and his little garrison were transported to Gibraltar, with absolute liberty to serve again. Byng was tried and executed; Blakeney, on his return to England, found himself the hero of the nation.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''At 12, Mr. Byng Was Shot''. Phoenix; First Edition (1 October 2002), 352 pages; {{ISBN|1842126075}}/{{ISBN|978-1842126073}} by Dudley Pope&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
He was made a [[colonel]] of the [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot]], a [[Order of the Bath|Knight Companion of the Bath]], and '''Baron Blakeney''' in the [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peerage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=9642|date=7 December 1756|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[John Van Nost|John Van Nost the Younger]]'s statue of him  was erected in Dublin (on the site of the present-day [[Spire of Dublin]]), and his popularity continued unabated for the short remainder of his life. He died unmarried on 10 September 1761,{{where?|date=March 2013}} and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The barony became extinct upon his death.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Memoirs of General William Blakeney'' (1757).&lt;!-- is an ISBN available? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the model neurons are simple, only elementary limit cycle behavior, i.e. [[neural oscillations]], and stimulus-dependent evoked responses are predicted. The key findings include the existence of multiple stable states, and hysteresis, in the population response.

==Mathematical description==

The Wilson–Cowan model considers a homogeneous population of interconnected neurons of excitatory and inhibitory subtypes. The fundamental quantity is the measure of the activity of an excitatory or inhibitory subtype within the population. More precisely, &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the proportions of excitatory and inhibitory cells firing at time t. They depend on the proportion of sensitive cells (that are not refractory) and on the proportion of these cells receiving at least threshold excitation.

===Sensitive cells===

Proportion of cells in refractory period (absolute refractory period &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;)
&lt;math&gt;\int_{t-r}^{t}E(t')dt'&lt;/math&gt;

Proportion of sensitive cells (complement of refractory cells)
&lt;math&gt;1-\int_{t-r}^{t}E(t')dt'&lt;/math&gt;

===Excited cells===
If &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; denotes a cell's [[threshold potential]] and &lt;math&gt;D(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the distribution of thresholds in the tissue, then the expected proportion of neurons receiving an excitation at or above threshold level per unit time is

&lt;math&gt;S(\bar{N})=\int_{0}^{\bar{N}(t)}D(\theta)d\theta&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{N}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the mean integrated excitation at time t. The term "integrated" in this case means that each neuron sums up (i.e. integrates) all incoming excitations in a linear fashion to receive its total excitation. If this integrated excitation is at or above the neuron's excitation threshold, it will in turn create an [[action potential]]. Note that the above equation relies heavily on the homogeneous distribution of neurons, as does the Wilson-Cowan model in general.

Subpopulation response function based on the distribution of afferent synapses per cell (all cells have the same threshold)

&lt;math&gt;S(\bar{N})=\int_{\frac{\theta}{\bar{N}(t)}}^{\infty}C(w)dw&lt;/math&gt;

Average excitation level of an excitatory cell at time  &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{t}\alpha(t-t')[c_1 E(t')-c_2 I(t')+P(t')]dt'&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the stimulus decay function, &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the connectivity coefficient giving the average number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses per cell, P(t) is the external input to the excitatory population.

Excitatory subpopulation expression

&lt;math&gt;E(t)=[1-\int_{t-r}^{t}E(t')dt']S(\bar{N})dt&lt;/math&gt;

Complete Wilson–Cowan model

&lt;math&gt;E(t+\tau)=[1-\int_{t-r}^{t}E(t')dt'] S_e \left \{\int_{-\infty}^{t}\alpha(t-t')[c_1E(t')-c_2I(t')+P(t')]dt'\right \}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I(t+\tau)=[1-\int_{t-r}^{t}I(t')dt'] S_i \left \{\int_{-\infty}^{t}\alpha(t-t')[c_3E(t')-c_4I(t')+Q(t')]dt'\right \}&lt;/math&gt;

Time Coarse Graining
&lt;math&gt;\tau\frac{d\bar{E}}{dt}=-\bar{E}+(1-r\bar{E})S_e[kc_1\bar{E}(t)+kP(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

Isocline Equation
&lt;math&gt;c_2I=c_1E-S_e^{-1}\left (\frac{E}{k_e-r_eE} \right )+P&lt;/math&gt;

[[Sigmoid function|Sigmoid Function]]
&lt;math&gt;S(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp[-a(\bar{N}-\theta)]}-\frac{1}{1+\exp(a\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Application to epilepsy==
The determination of three concepts is fundamental to an understanding of hypersynchronization of neurophysiological activity at the global (system) level:&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"&gt;V. Shusterman and W. C. Troy. From baseline to epileptiform activity: A path to synchronized rhythmicity in large-scale neural networks.

&lt;!--What are the key factors determining the rate of expansion of hypersynchronized regions?--&gt;
# The electrophysiological activity pattern dynamics on a large-scale &lt;!--This point seems a bit vague - might be useful to clarify what exactly makes patterns interesting or relevant to the model.--&gt;
&lt;!--How do large-scale patterns of electrophysiological activity in adjacent areas interact with each other?--&gt;

A [[canonical analysis]] of these issues, developed in 2008 by Shusterman and Troy using the Wilson–Cowan model,&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"/&gt; predicts qualitative and quantitative features of epileptiform activity. In particular, it accurately predicts the propagation speed of epileptic seizures (which is approximately 4–7 times slower than normal brain wave activity) in a human subject with chronically implanted electroencephalographic electrodes.&lt;ref name="Towle-Milton Book"&gt;V. L. Towle, F. Ahmad, M. Kohrman, K. Hecox, and S. Chkhenkeli, in ''Epilepsy as a Dynamic Disease'', pp. 69–81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Milton.

Rev. 2010: 92025.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition into hypersynchronization===

The transition from normal state of brain activity to epileptic seizures was not formulated theoretically until 2008, when a theoretical path from a baseline state to large-scale self-sustained oscillations, which spread out uniformly from the point of stimulus, has been mapped for the first time.&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"/&gt;

A realistic state of baseline physiological activity has been defined, using the following '''two-component definition''':&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"/&gt;

'''(1)''' A time-independent component represented by subthreshold excitatory activity E and superthreshold inhibitory activity I.

'''(2)''' A time-varying component which may include singlepulse waves, multipulse waves, or periodic waves caused by spontaneous neuronal activity.

This baseline state represents activity of the brain in the state of relaxation, in which neurons receive some level of spontaneous, weak stimulation by small, naturally present concentrations of neurohormonal substances. In waking adults this state is commonly associated with [[Alpha wave|alpha rhythm]], whereas slower ([[Theta wave|theta]] and [[Delta wave|delta]]) rhythms  are usually observed during deeper relaxation and sleep. To describe this general setting, a 3-variable &lt;math&gt; (u,I,v) &lt;/math&gt; spatially dependent extension of the classical Wilson–Cowan model can be utilized.&lt;ref name="WC-paper2"&gt;H. R. Wilson and J. D. Cowan. A mathematical theory of the functional dynamics of cortical and thalamic nervous tissue. Kybernetik 13, 55,1973. {{PMID|4767470}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under appropriate initial conditions,&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"/&gt; the excitatory component, u, dominates over the inhibitory component, I, and the three-variable system reduces to the two-variable Pinto-Ermentrout type model&lt;ref name="Pinto and G. B. Ermentrout-2001"&gt;D. Pinto and G. B. Ermentrout. Spatially Structured Activity in Synaptically Coupled Neuronal Networks: I. Traveling Fronts and Pulses. SIAM J. Appl. Math. 62, 206;2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\partial u  \over \partial t}=u-v+             \int_{R^2}\omega(x-x',y-y')f(u-\theta)\,dxdy + \zeta(x,y,t),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{\partial v  \over \partial t}=\epsilon (\beta u-v).&lt;/math&gt;

The variable v governs the recovery of excitation u; &lt;math&gt; \epsilon&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; determine the rate of change of recovery. The connection function &lt;math&gt; \omega(x,y) &lt;/math&gt; is positive, continuous, symmetric, and has the typical form &lt;math&gt; \omega=Ae^{-\lambda\sqrt {-(x^2+y^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Pinto and G. B. Ermentrout-2001"/&gt; In Ref.&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;(A,\lambda)=(2.1,1).&lt;/math&gt; The firing rate function, which is generally accepted to have a sharply increasing sigmoidal shape, is approximated by &lt;math&gt; f(u-\theta)=H(u-\theta) &lt;/math&gt;, where H denotes the Heaviside function; &lt;math&gt; \zeta(x,y,t) &lt;/math&gt; is a short-time stimulus. This &lt;math&gt; (u,v) &lt;/math&gt; system has been successfully used in a wide variety of neuroscience research studies.&lt;ref name="Pinto and G. B. Ermentrout-2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Folias_Bressloff_1"&gt;S. E. Folias and P. C. Bressloff, Breathing pulses in an excitatory neural network. SIAM J. Appl. Dyn.

Laing and W. C. Troy. PDE methods for non-local models. SIAM J Appl Dyn Syst. (Vol 2, no. 3, pp. 487-516, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it predicted the existence of spiral waves, which can occur during seizures; this theoretical prediction  was subsequently confirmed experimentally using optical imaging of slices from the rat cortex.&lt;ref name="Spiral-wave paper"&gt;X. Huang, W. C. Troy, Q. Yang, H. Ma, C. R. Laing, S. J. Schiff and J. Y. Wu. Spiral waves in disinhibited mammalian neocortex. J Neurosci. 2004 Nov 3;24(44):9897-902.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rate of expansion===
The expansion of hypersynchronized regions exhibiting large-amplitude stable bulk oscillations occurs when the oscillations coexist with the stable rest state &lt;math&gt;(u,v)=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;. To understand the mechanism responsible for the expansion, it is necessary to linearize the &lt;math&gt; (u, v) &lt;/math&gt; system around &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is held fixed. The linearized system exhibits subthreshold decaying oscillations whose frequency increases as &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; increases. At a critical value  &lt;math&gt;\beta^{*}&lt;/math&gt; where the oscillation frequency is high enough, bistability occurs in the &lt;math&gt;(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;  system: a stable, spatially independent, periodic solution (bulk oscillation) and a stable rest state coexist over a continuous range of parameters. When &lt;math&gt;\beta\ge\beta^{*}&lt;/math&gt; where bulk oscillations occur,&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"/&gt; "The rate of expansion of the hypersynchronization region is determined by an interplay between two key features: (i) the speed '''c''' of waves that form and propagate outward from the edge of the region, and (ii) the concave shape of the graph of the activation variable '''u''' as it rises, during each bulk oscillation cycle, from the rest state '''u'''=0 to the activation threshold. Numerical experiments show that during the rise of 
'''u''' towards threshold, as the rate of vertical increase slows down, over time interval &lt;math&gt;\Delta t,&lt;/math&gt; due to the concave component, the stable solitary wave emanating from the region causes the region to expand spatially at a '''Rate''' proportional to the wave speed. From this initial observation it is natural to expect that the proportionality constant should be the fraction of the time that the solution is concave during one cycle." Therefore, when &lt;math&gt;\beta\ge\beta^{*}&lt;/math&gt;, the rate of expansion of the region is estimated by&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Rate =(\Delta t/T)*c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(1) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta t &lt;/math&gt; is the length of subthreshold time interval, '''T''' is period of the periodic solution;  '''c''' is  the speed of waves emanating from the hypersynchronization region. A realistic value of '''c''', derived by Wilson et al.,&lt;ref name="Wilson-Nature"&gt;H. R. Wilson, R. Blake and S. H. Lee. Dynamics of travelling waves in visual perception. ''Nature'' 2001, 412, 907-910.&lt;/ref&gt; is '''c'''=22.4&amp;nbsp;mm/s.

'''How to evaluate the ratio &lt;math&gt;\Delta t/T?&lt;/math&gt;''' To determine values for &lt;math&gt; \Delta t/T &lt;/math&gt; it is necessary to analyze the underlying bulk oscillation which satisfies the spatially independent system

&lt;math&gt;{{du} \over {dt}}=u-v+H(u-\theta),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{{dv} \over {dt}}=\epsilon (\beta u-v).&lt;/math&gt;

This system is derived using standard functions and parameter values &lt;math&gt; \omega=2.1e^{-\lambda\sqrt {-(x^2+y^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \epsilon=0.1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \theta=0.1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinto and G. B. Ermentrout-2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Folias_Bressloff_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Folias_Bressloff_2"/&gt; Bulk oscillations occur when &lt;math&gt; \beta \ge \beta^{*}=12.61&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;12.61 \le \beta \le 17&lt;/math&gt;, Shusterman and Troy analyzed the bulk oscillations and found &lt;math&gt;0.136 \le \Delta t/T \le 0.238&lt;/math&gt;. This gives the range

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; 3.046 mm/s \le Rate \le 5.331 mm/s~~~~~~~~~~~~(2) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;0.136 \le \Delta t/T \le 0.238&lt;/math&gt;, Eq. (1) shows that the migration '''Rate''' is a fraction of the traveling wave speed, which is consistent with experimental and clinical observations regarding the slow spread of epileptic activity.&lt;ref name="Epilepsy Book"&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2014}}Epilepsy as a Dynamic Disease, edited by J. Milton and P. Jung, Biological and Medical Physics series Springer, Berlin, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This migration mechanism also provides a plausible explanation for spread and sustenance of epileptiform activity without a driving source that, despite a number of experimental studies, has never been observed.&lt;ref name="Epilepsy Book"/&gt;

===Comparing theoretical and experimental migration rates===

The rate of migration of hypersynchronous activity that was experimentally recorded during seizures in a human subject, using chronically implanted subdural electrodes on the surface of the left temporal lobe,&lt;ref name="Towle-Milton Book"/&gt; has been estimated as&lt;ref name="Shusterman-Troy"/&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Rate \approx 4 mm/s&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;br /&gt;
which is consistent with the theoretically predicted range given above in (2). The ratio '''Rate/c''' in formula (1) shows that the leading edge of the region of synchronous seizure activity migrates approximately 4–7 times more slowly than normal brain wave activity, which is in agreement with the experimental data described above.&lt;ref name="Towle-Milton Book"/&gt;

To summarize, mathematical modeling and theoretical analysis of large-scale electrophysiological activity provide tools for predicting the spread and migration of hypersynchronous brain activity, which can be useful for diagnostic evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy. It might be also useful for predicting migration and spread of electrical activity over large regions of the brain that occur during [[deep sleep]] ([[Delta wave]]), cognitive activity and in other functional settings.
