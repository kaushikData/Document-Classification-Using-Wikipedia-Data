Brandley was working as a janitor supervisor at [[Conroe High School]] in [[Conroe, Texas]] where Fergeson was a 16-year-old student athlete visiting the school from Bellville, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/clarence-brandley-dies-66/&lt;/ref&gt;
Brandley was held for nine years on [[death row]]. After lengthy legal proceedings and community outcry that eventually ended in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], Clarence Brandley was freed in 1990. After his release, Brandley was involved in further legal proceedings over [[child support]] payments that had accrued over his time in [[prison]], and ultimately with an unsuccessful $120 million lawsuit against various agencies of the State of Texas.

==The crime==
Cheryl Dee Fergeson, a 16-year-old [[High school junior|junior]] at Bellville High School, was murdered on August 23, 1980. Fergeson was part of a school [[volleyball]] team playing a match against another [[Conroe High School|high school]] in [[Conroe, Texas]]. Her body was found in the [[loft]] above the school [[auditorium]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Suspicion immediately fell on two of the [[Janitor|custodians]], Brandley and Henry (Icky) Peace, who had found the body. During their joint interrogation — as Peace would recount — Texas Ranger Wesley Styles told them, "One of you is going to have to hang for this" and then, turning to Brandley, added, "Since you're the [[nigger]], you're elected."&lt;ref&gt;"Innocence and the Death Penalty" 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==

===Co-workers' statements===
The three claimed to have seen the victim enter a girls' [[restroom]] near the school [[gym]]nasium, and then to have seen Brandley walking toward the restroom with an armload of [[toilet paper]]. They claimed that they told Brandley there was a girl in the restroom, and that he replied that he was taking the toilet paper to the boys' restroom. They did not see him again until about 45 minutes later, after a search had begun for the missing student. The fourth white custodian, Peace, subsequently added that Brandley was insistent on immediately searching the loft and, when they found the [[Dead body|body]], calmly checked for a [[pulse]] and then notified the authorities. And all four said that only Brandley had keys to the [[auditorium]] where the body was found.&lt;ref&gt;Radelet 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brandley's statements===
Before an [[all-white jury|all-white]] [[Montgomery County, Texas|Montgomery County]] [[grand jury]] on August 28, 1980, five days after the crime, Brandley professed innocence. Although he contradicted his white co-workers in several respects, he acknowledged that he had disappeared for perhaps 30 minutes about the time the murder was believed to have occurred. He said he was in the custodian's office smoking and listening to music alone.&lt;ref&gt;Radelet 122.&lt;/ref&gt; He also testified that a number of other persons had master keys that would open the auditorium and, in any event, that doors near the stage usually were propped open with a [[wikt:two by four|two-by-four]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Trials===
Brandley went on trial in December 1980 before an all-white jury. There was no physical evidence linking him to the crime. [[Spermatozoa]] recovered from the victim's body had been destroyed — without having been tested to determine whether Brandley could have been its source. Moreover, a fresh blood spot had been found on the victim's [[blouse]] that had not come from her and could not have come from Brandley. The spot was Type A, but Brandley had Type O blood. One juror found the evidence insufficient to establish guilt, forcing Judge Sam Robertson, Jr. to declare a mistrial. The name of the holdout juror — William Shreck — became public knowledge, leading to anonymous harassing telephone calls.&lt;ref&gt;Applebome 26.&lt;/ref&gt; One man, whose anonymous communication was monitored by police, threatened Shreck, "We're going to get you, nigger lover."

At Brandley's second trial in February 1981 before another all-white jury but a different judge, one of the original witnesses — John Sessum — was not called. Later it was discovered that the prosecution had decided not to use Sessum because he no longer was willing to support the other custodians' versions of events, even though he had been threatened with being charged with [[perjury]] if he refused to go along. However, the prosecution came up with a [[witness]] who had not testified previously. He was Danny Taylor, a junior at the school, who had worked briefly as a custodian but was fired before the crime. Taylor claimed that Brandley once had commented — after a group of white female students walked past them — "If I got one of them alone, ain't no tellin' what I might do."{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Dr. Joseph Jachimczyk, [[medical examiner]] for Harris County, testified that the victim had died of [[strangulation]] and that a belt belonging to Brandley was consistent with the [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] used in the crime. In closing argument, [[District attorney]] James Keeshan mentioned that Brandley had a second job at a [[funeral home]] and suggested that perhaps he was a [[necrophiliac]] and had raped Fergeson after she was dead — an argument that could not have been made in good faith because Keeshan had a report stating that Brandley only did odd jobs at the funeral home and had never been involved in the preparation of bodies for burial. The defense objected to Keeshan's remark as inflammatory, but Judge John Martin overruled the objection.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Post-conviction===
Eleven months after Brandley was convicted and [[sentenced to death]], his appellate lawyers discovered that [[exculpatory evidence]] had disappeared while in the custody of the prosecution — including a [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] [[pubic hair]] and other hairs recovered from Fergeson's body that were neither hers nor Brandley's.&lt;ref&gt;Haines 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Also missing were photographs taken of Brandley on the day of the crime showing that he was not wearing the belt that the prosecution claimed had been the murder weapon. The missing evidence was all the more troubling in light of the pretrial destruction of the spermatozoa.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Much was made of the willful destruction and disappearance of the potentially exculpatory evidence in Brandley's appellate briefs, but the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] affirmed the conviction and death sentence without mentioning the issue. "No reasonable hypothesis is presented by the evidence to even suggest that someone other than [Brandley] committed the crime", said the court. Brandley V. Texas, 691 S.W.2d 699 (1985).

Brenda Medina, who lived in the nearby town of [[Cut and Shoot, Texas]], saw a television broadcast about the Brandley case. Saying she had been unaware of the case until then, she told a neighbor that her former live-in boyfriend — James Dexter Robinson — had told her in 1980 that he had committed such a crime. Robinson had previously worked as a janitor at Conroe High School.  Medina said she had not believed Robinson at the time, but now it made sense.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 18.&lt;/ref&gt; At the neighbor's suggestion, she went to see an attorney, who took her to see District Attorney Peter Speers III, who had succeeded Keeshan in the job when Keeshan ascended to the Texas District Court bench. Speers quickly concluded, or so he said, that Medina was unreliable — and, therefore, that he had no obligation to inform Brandley's lawyers. The private attorney she had consulted thought otherwise, however, and brought her to the attention of the defense.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===State ''habeas corpus'' sought===
After obtaining Medina's sworn statement, Brandley's lawyers petitioned the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]''. The court ordered an evidentiary hearing, which was conducted by District Court Judge Ernest A. Coker.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Before calling Medina to testify at the evidentiary hearing, Brandley's defense team called Edward Payne, father-in-law of Gary Acreman, one of the school custodians who had testified at both Brandley trials and who was now suspected by the defense of having been a co-perpetrator of the crime with Robinson. Payne testified that Acreman had told him where Fergeson's clothes had been hidden two days before the authorities found them.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

After Medina related details of Robinson's purported confession, Brandley's lawyers called John Sessum, the custodian who had testified at the first trial but not the second. Sessum's testimony was in sharp contrast to what he had said at the first trial. He now said he had seen Acreman follow Cheryl Fergeson up a staircase leading to the auditorium and then heard her scream, "No" and "Don't." Later that day, Acreman warned Sessum not to tell anyone what he had seen. But Sessum said he did tell someone — Wesley Styles, the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] who was leading the investigation. That was a mistake. Styles, according to Sessum, responded by threatening him with arrest if he did not tell a story consistent with Acreman's.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Community activism and result===
Despite the accumulation of new evidence, Judge Coker recommended that Brandley be denied a new trial — a recommendation perfunctorily accepted by the Court of Criminal Appeals on December 22, 1986. But by now civil rights activists, including Reverend [[Jew Don Boney]], had coalesced and raised $80,000 to help finance further efforts on Brandley's behalf. The Rev. Boney was the Chairman of the Houston, Texas-based "Coalition to Free Clarence Lee Brandley" and spearheaded  community efforts to have Brandley receive a fair trial. Boney was interviewed on numerous national news outlets and brought significant media and community attention to the case. National Advocate James McCloskey, of Centurion Ministries in Princeton, New Jersey, also took on the case.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Working with a [[private investigator]], McCloskey soon obtained a [[video-tape]]d statement from Acreman stating that Robinson had killed Cheryl Fergeson and that he had seen Robinson place her clothes in a [[dumpster]] where they were found; that is how Acreman knew where the clothes were before they were found. Although Acreman soon recanted that video statement, two witnesses had come forward attesting that they had heard Acreman say he knew who killed Fergeson, that it was not Brandley, but that he would never tell who did it. Based on these statements, with Brandley's execution only six days away, Coker granted a stay.

===A fair hearing===
After further investigation, Brandley's lawyers petitioned for another evidentiary hearing, which the Court of Criminal Appeals granted on June 30, 1987. The new hearing was conducted by Special State District Judge Perry Pickett. Robinson, Acerman, and Styles testified for the prosecution, each seeming to help rather than hurt Brandley's case.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Robinson admitted he had told Brenda Medina in 1980 that he had killed the young woman in Conroe, but claimed he had said that only to frighten Medina. She had been pressuring him because she was pregnant, he said, and he simply wanted her to stop pestering him. Acreman stuck by what he had said at both trials, although he admitted that Robinson had been at Conroe High School the morning of the murder. Incidentally, Robinson and Acreman, unlike Brandley, had Type A blood — consistent with the spot on Fergeson's blouse.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Texas Ranger Styles, while denying he had done anything improper, acknowledged that even before he had interviewed any witnesses, Brandley was his only suspect. When pressed about why he had not obtained a hair sample from Acreman to compare with the Caucasian pubic hair and other hairs found on the victim, Styles stammered, "Let's say I didn't do it and it wasn't done, and why it wasn't done, I don't know."{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

On October 9, 1987, Judge Pickett recommended that the Court of Criminal Appeals grant Brandley a new trial, declaring: "The litany of events graphically described by the witnesses, some of it chilling and shocking, leads me to the conclusion the pervasive shadow of darkness has obscured the light of fundamental decency and human rights." The Court of Criminal Appeals, after sitting on the case for 14 months, finally accepting Picket's recommendation with a sharply split en banc decision on December 13, 1989 (Ex Parte Brandley, 781 S.W.2d 886 (1989)).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The prosecution appealed, delaying disposition of the case another 10 months. But within hours of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s denial of [[certiorari]] on October 1, 1990 (Texas v. Brandley, 498 U.S. 817 (1990)), they dropped all charges. A few months later, Brandley was ordained as a [[Baptist]] minister, and a few months after that he was married. The officials involved in the case were not disciplined, nor did they apologize. Prosecutors in the case still insist they convicted the right man.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14920">'''Czech names''' are composed of a '''[[given name]]''' and a '''[[surname]]'''. Czechs typically get one given name – additional names may be chosen by themselves upon baptism but they generally use one. With marriage, the bride typically adopts the bridegroom's surname.

==Given names==
In the [[Czech Republic]], names are simply known as ''jména'' ("names") or, if the context requires it, ''křestní jména'' ("Baptism names"). The singular form is ''jméno''. Generally, a given name may have [[Christian name|Christian roots]] or traditional  [[Slavic names|Slavic pre-Christian origin]] (e.g. [[Milena (name)|Milena]], [[Dobromir (given name)|Dobromira]], [[Jaroslav (disambiguation)|Jaroslav]], [[Václav (disambiguation)|Václav]], [[Wojciech|Vojtěch]]).

In the past, it was common to give only officially recognized names to children, which were mostly adopted from extended Christian calendar. A special permission was necessary for other names; of course, there were exception for minorities, foreigners etc. Since the [[Velvet revolution]] in 1989, parents have had the right to give their child any name they wish, provided it is used somewhere in the world and is not insulting or demeaning. However, the common practice of last years is that most birth-record offices look for the name in the book "Jak se bude vaše dítě jmenovat?" (What is your child going to be called?),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; which is a semi-official list of "allowed" names. If the name is not found there, authorities are extremely unwilling to register the child's name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blisty.cz/2004/6/4/art18387.html "Stát rozhoduje, jak se bude jmenovat vaše dítě"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech parents remain somewhat conservative in their choices of baby names. In January 2004, the most popular boy's names were ''Jan'' (John), ''Jakub'' (Jacob or James) and ''Tomáš'' (Thomas). The most popular girl's names were ''Tereza'' (Theresa), ''Kateřina'' (Katherine) and ''Eliška'' (Liz or Elise). Throughout all the nine years, the name Tereza is ruling among girls born in January every year. There are much more girls of that name than those of the name on the second position. For six years, the second position belonged to little girls named Kateřina, who have lost recently to Eliška, later to Adéla and most recently to Karolína. Promotion of Eliška upwards to the most popular names was patient and slow, while Adéla kept near the top more steadily (during the last five years she kept the second to fourth position and only in 2007 she fell to the sixth). Quick jump in popularity belongs to Natálie, who remains for six years between the third and seventh position. Anna is celebrating her comeback to the fourth position (her fame was overshadowed only in 2002). Top positions were gradually cleaned out by Nikola (from the previous fourth position she left the first fifteen completely and later came back to around the tenth position). Kristýna holds tight among the top ten for eight years (the trend is, however, decreasing in the long term). Jumper of the last three years is probably Karolína (on the turn of the decades she kept right below the top ten, later her fame was waning, however, during recent years she jumped
gradually to the sixth, seventh and even to the second position). Throughout the surveyed period, during the first four years popularity of Barbora was growing dynamically, but from 2003 she is on the tenth to fourteenth position. In the beginning of the period, Veronika was very popular; during five years she fell from the sixth position to the
twelfth and later came back to the top ten for a while in 2006. Lucie was in the bottom among the most popular names during the last nine years, however, recently she can be found in the end of the top ten list and her popularity seems to gradually increase.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.czso.cz/eng/redakce.nsf/i/the_most_popular_names_given_to_children_in_the_czech_republic_1999_2007/$File/jmena2007en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Names, like all nouns in the [[Czech language|language]], have [[grammatical case]]s; that is, they change depending on their role in the sentence. For example, one would say ''Pavel kouše sendvič'' ("Paul bites a sandwich"), but ''Pes kouše Pavl'''a''''' ("A dog bites Paul") and ''Pes ukousl Pavl'''ovi''' prst'' ("The dog bit Paul's finger off"). Unlike the very closely related [[Slovak language]], Czech has a [[vocative case]], a form of a word used only when calling or addressing someone. For instance, one would say, ''Pavl'''e''', pozor pes!'' (Paul, watch out for the dog!).

==Surnames==
While Czechs share relatively few given names — roughly 260 names have a frequency above 500 in the Czech Republic — there are tens of thousands of Czech surnames (singular and plural: ''příjmení''). These are similar in origin to English ones and may reflect:
* a personal characteristic of someone's ancestor (such as ''Malý'' – "small", ''Veselý'' – "cheerful", ''Železný'' – "iron")
* occupation (''[[Kovář (surname)|Kovář]]'' – "blacksmith", ''Kolář'' – "wheeler", ''Sedlák'' – "landowning farmer", ''Kočí'' – "coachman")
* the first name of a relative (''Marek'' – "Mark", ''David'', ''Eliáš'' – "Elias")
* animals (''Liška'' – "fox", ''Zajíc'' – "hare", ''Jelínek'' – "little deer", ''Ježek'' – "hedgehog", ''Kocourek'' – "little tomcat")
* especially birds (''Sokol'' – "falcon", ''Čermák'' – "black redstart", ''Kalous'' – "asio", ''Sýkora'' – "titmouse", ''Holub'' – "pigeon", ''Čáp'' – "stork")
* plants (''[[Konvalinka (surname)|Konvalinka]]'' – "[[lily of the valley]]", ''Růžička'' – "little rose", ''Fiala'' – "violet", ''Javor'' – "maple")
* especially fruits and vegetables (''Jahoda'' – "strawberry", ''Hruška'' – "pear", ''Cibulka'' – "little onion")
* food (''Oliva'' – "olive", ''Makovec'' – "poppy cake", ''Slanina'' – "bacon")
* places of origin (''Slezák'' – "Silesian", ''Moravec'' – "Moravian", ''Němec'' – "German")
* also in a form of adjectives (''Rosický'' – "of [[Rosice]]", ''Nepomucký'' – "of [[Nepomuk]]")
* actions, usually in [[past simple]] (''Musil'' – "(he) had to", ''Pospíšil'' – "(he) hurried up", ''Zdražil'' – "(he) raised the price", ''Hrabal'' – "(he) raked")
* things (''Procházka'' – "stroll", ''Chalupa'' – "cottage", ''Svačina'' – "snack", ''Kučera'' – "a curl of hair")
* and many others

What is not shared with English but is similar to North American native languages is the extremely colorful nature of some Czech surnames, such as ''Brzobohatý'' (Soon to be rich), ''Volopich'' (Pricking an ox), ''Urvinitka'' (Tear a string), ''Rádsetoulal'' (Liked wandering around), ''Stojaspal'' (Slept standing), ''Vítámvás'' (I welcome you), ''Tenkrát'' (Back in those days), ''Schovajsa'' (Hide yourself!), ''Nebojsa'' (Don't be afraid!), ''Skočdopole'' (Jump in a field!), ''Vozihnoj'' (Driving with manure), ''Osolsobě'' (Salt for yourself!), ''Ventluka'' (Knocking outward), ''Nejezchleba'' (Don't eat bread!), ''Potměšil'' (He sewed in the dark), ''Přecechtěl'' (He wanted anyway), ''Drahokoupil'' (He bought costly), ''Nepovím'' (I'm not going to tell) or ''Blabla''.

[[German language|German]] surnames are also quite common in the Czech Republic; the country was part of the [[Austrian Empire]] before 1918 and had a large German population until [[World War II]]. Some of them got phonetically normalized and transcribed to Czech (''Müller'' (miller) as well as ''Miler''; ''Stein'' (Stone) as well as ''Štajn'', ''Schmied'' (Smith) as well as ''Šmíd'' (or ''Šmýd''), Fritsch (Frič), Schlessinger (Šlesingr), etc. Some of them retain their original German surnames e. g. : Gottwald, Feiersinger, Dienstbier, Berger, Koller, Klaus, Franz, Forman, Ebermann, Lendl, Ulihrach, Gebauer, Kaberle, Vogelstanz, etc.

Many of Czech surnames occur in a [[diminutive]] form, e. g. Sedlák – Sedláček, Polák → Poláček, Novák → Nováček, Zajíc → Zajíček, Němec → Němeček, Kalous → Kalousek, Havel → Havlík → Havlíček, Kovář → Kovařík → Kovaříček, Holub → Holoubek, Kocour → Kocourek, Cibula → Cibulka, Petržela → Petrželka, Chalupa → Chaloupka, Čáp → Čapek, Beran – Beránek

The most common Czech surnames are ''[[Novák]]'' ("Newman"), ''[[Svoboda (surname)|Svoboda]]'' ("Freeman," literally "Freedom"), ''[[Novotny (surname)|Novotný]]'' (same origin as ''Novák''), ''[[Dvořák (disambiguation)|Dvořák]]'' (from ''dvůr'', "court") and ''[[Černý]]'' ("Black").&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070518084302/http://www.mvcr.cz/sprava/informat/cetnost/index.html Czech Ministry of the Interior, "Četnost jmen a příjmení," 18 May 2007]{{Cs icon}}. Retrieved 19 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female surnames===
As in English-speaking countries, Czech women traditionally receive their father's surname at birth and take their husband's name when they marry. However, the names are not exactly the same; the endings differ to fit into the Czech language's systems of [[grammatical gender|gender adjective]]s. For example, the tennis players [[Cyril Suk]] and [[Helena Suková]] are brother and sister; ''Suková'' is the feminine form of ''Suk''. In fact, Czech female surnames are almost always feminine [[adjective]]s. There are several ways of forming them, depending on their male counterpart:

*If the male surname is a masculine [[adjective]] (ending in ''-ý''), the female surname is simply the feminine equivalent. Thus, a girl whose father's surname is ''Novotn'''ý''' '' would have the surname ''Novotn'''á''' ''.
*If the male surname is a [[noun]], the female surname takes the [[suffix]] ''-ová'', making it a feminine adjective:
**''Novák'' becomes ''Novák'''ová'''''
**''Horáč'''e'''k'' becomes ''Horáčk'''ová'''''
**''Svobod'''a''''' becomes ''Svobod'''ová'''''
**''Navrátil'' (in the literal meaning of "he returned") becomes ''Navrátil'''ová''''', i.e. not declined into ''Navrátila'' ("she returned")

A few Czech surnames do not differ for men and women in the [[nominative]] case (the case used for the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a sentence). Those include surnames whose male form is [[genitive]] [[plural]], (e.g. ''Jirků'', ''Janků'') and those whose male form is an adjective with the suffix ''-í'' (e.g. ''Tachecí'', ''Jarní''). Note that these are only identical in two of the seven grammatical cases; in the other five, the male and female forms differ, as per the [[Czech declension#Soft declension|soft adjective declension]]. The woman's surname is also not declined if it is of foreign origin and adding the suffix ''-ová'' would be awkward or unfeasible: Olga Walló, Blanka Matragi.

Otherwise, ''-ová'' is still added, even when speaking of foreigners ("Angela Merkelová"). Because gender-marked suffixes are inherited in the Czech grammar and also because the gender of a person could be told straight from the surname regardless of the context, Czechs tend to add a feminine suffix to the surnames of Czech as well as foreign women surnames. Thus, e.g. American [[first lady]] [[Michelle Obama]] is referred to as ''Michelle Obamová'' in the Czech press.  Science Fiction writer [[Ursula Le Guin]] appears in Czech translations as ''Ursula Le Guinová''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Gwydion M. |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/45909111@N00/2999434454/in/set-72157608614718792 |title=2008_09_05_DSC01465 &amp;#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date=2012-07-08 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is not universal, however. In recent years, there has been lively discussion whether or not to change foreign female surnames in public use (such as in media references etc.). Supporters of abandoning this habit claim that adding a Czech female suffix to a foreign surname means deliberately changing a woman's name and is therefore both misleading and inconsiderate, whereas traditionalists point out that only by adding the suffix can the name be used as a flexible feminine adjective within a naturally sounding Czech sentence. Although the discussion continues, the majority of newspapers and other media use the "adopted" versions.

Until 2004, every woman who married in the Czech Republic and wanted to change her name had to adopt a feminine surname, unless her husband was a foreigner whose name ended in a vowel or she was a registered member of a Czech minority group, such as the Germans. A law passed in 2004 allows all foreign women, and Czech women who marry foreign men, to adopt their husband's exact surname.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/P03/2004/Art/0304/news7.php Lenka Ponikelska, "Law would mean surname options," ''The Prague Post'' 4 March 2004]. Retrieved 24 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in English-speaking countries, some Czech women decide to keep their maiden name after marriage or adopt a double surname. A couple can also agree to both adopt the woman's surname, with the husband using the masculine form.

==Surnames in the plural==
Surnames that are nouns in the masculine singular:
*''Novák'''ovi''' - the Nováks''
*''rodina Novák'''ova''' - the Novák family''
*''bratři Novák'''ovi''' - the brothers Novák''
*''sestry Novák'''ovy''' - the sisters Novák''

All forms of the surname ''Novák'' are [[possessive adjective]]s in the plural; their [[Ending (linguistics)|ending]]s depend on the gender and case.

Surnames that are adjectives in the masculine singular:
*''Novotn'''í''' - the Novotnýs''
*''rodina Novotn'''ých''' - the Novotný family''
*''bratři Novotn'''í''' - the brothers Novotný''
*''sestry Novotn'''é''' - the sisters Novotný''

All forms of the surname ''Novotný'' are adjectives in the plural; their endings depend on the gender and case. The form ''Novotných'' is in the [[genitive]] case.

Following his death, he was lauded by world leaders as "the greatest European leader of the second half of the 20th century" and was honoured with an unprecedented [[European act of state in honour of Helmut Kohl|European Act of State in his honour]] in [[Strasbourg]], France, attended by the leaders of the EU's nations and other current and former world leaders. Subsequently, a Catholic [[requiem mass]] was celebrated in the [[Speyer Cathedral]] in [[Speyer]], Germany, before Kohl was interred in the nearby Old Cemetery.

Helmut Kohl was survived by his two sons [[Walter Kohl]] and [[Peter Kohl]], and by his grandchildren Johannes and Leyla Kohl. No member of the Kohl family—Kohl's children and grandchildren—participated in any of the ceremonies, owing to a feud with Kohl's controversial new wife [[Maike Kohl-Richter]], who had among other things barred them from paying their respects to him at his house, ignored their wish for a ceremony in Berlin and their wish that Kohl should be interred alongside his parents and his wife of four decades [[Hannelore Kohl]] in the family tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/speyer-requiem-fuer-helmut-kohl.2852.de.html?dram:article_id=390071|title= Requiem für Helmut Kohl|work=Deutschlandfunk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Catholic [[requiem mass]] was celebrated in the [[Speyer Cathedral]] in [[Speyer]], Germany. It was broadcast on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/regional/mainz/parteien-dom-von-speyer-wegen-kohl-requiem-ab-mittwoch-geschlossen_id_7276552.html|title=Mainz: Dom von Speyer wegen Kohl-Requiem ab Mittwoch geschlossen|first=FOCUS|last=Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral==
The Kohl family—Kohl's children and grandchildren—favoured a burial in the family tomb in [[Ludwigshafen]] where both of Kohl's parents, his grandparents and his wife of 41 years [[Hannelore Kohl]] are interred.

Kohl's controversial second wife [[Maike Kohl-Richter]] however insisted on a burial in a separate tomb in [[Speyer]]. After the Church had turned down her request to bury Kohl inside the Speyer Cathedral alongside several Holy Roman Emperors, she decided on a burial in the nearby Old Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/staatsakt-fuer-helmut-kohl-soll-auf-europaeischer-ebene-stattfinden-15068106.html|title=Trauer um Helmut Kohl : Europäisch über den Tod hinaus|first=Günter|last=Bannas|date=20 June 2017|publisher=|via=FAZ.NET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Controversy was caused when Helmut Kohl's controversial new wife [[Maike Kohl-Richter]] (formerly Richter) prevented Kohl's children and grandchildren from paying their respects to their deceased father and grandfather. In a statement to the media, Kohl's son [[Walter Kohl]] accused her of "tasteless behaviour."&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-kohl-orban-idUKKBN19D1Y0?il=0|title=Kohl's widow in tug-of-war over unification Chancellor's legacy|first=Thomas|last=Escritt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maike Richter was also criticized for attempting to take full control of the memorial ceremony in Strasbourg, and for denying Helmut Kohl a German [[state occasion|act of state]] in Berlin, as desired by most German politicians, out of spite for Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]. Richter, who is known for hard-right anti-immigrant views and for her support for Hungary's controversial Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]], also attempted to bar Chancellor Merkel from speaking at the European memorial ceremony and wanted to have Orbán speaking instead. She only relented when told by confidantes that it would cause a scandal and be considered extremely inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20170621/orban-not-merkel-was-supposed-to-speak-at-kohl-memorial-report|title=Orban, not Merkel, was supposed to speak at Kohl memorial: report|date=21 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40368709|title=Toxic family feud as Germany mourns unifier Kohl|first=Jenny|last=Hill|date=22 June 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kohl family has declined to participate in the funeral in Speyer because they object to their father and grandfather not being interred next to his wife of 41 years, [[Hannelore Kohl]].&lt;ref name="welt.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article165854878/Kohl-Sohn-kommt-nicht-zur-privaten-Beisetzung.html|title=Helmut Kohl: Sohn Walter Kohl kommt nicht zur privaten Beisetzung in Speyer - WELT|website=DIE WELT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his biography of his mother, Kohl's son [[Peter Kohl]] wrote that Maike Richter seemed to have an unhealthy obsession with his father and compared her to a [[Stalking|stalker]] who had ensnared his father.&lt;ref name="ntv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n-tv.de/panorama/Kohls-Soehne-rechnen-ab-article10221011.html|title="Eine Mischung aus Scham und Peinlichkeit": Kohls Söhne rechnen ab|first=n-tv|last=Nachrichtenfernsehen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kohl family, unlike Maike Richter, also supports a state ceremony in Berlin.&lt;ref name="welt.de"/&gt;

'''Delgadito''' (not to be confused with at least two homonymous Navajo chiefs) was a chief (''nantan'') of the Copper Mines group of Tchihende ([[Mimbreño]]) people, one of the three divisions (Tchihende, Chiricahua e Ndendahe) of central Apaches.

==Life as war-leader and chief==
As a young warrior and, later, as a war-leader and a chief he fought under Tchihende come Juan Josè (eventually his uncle) and Fuerte, later of their successors [[Mangas Coloradas]] (chief of the "Coppermine" Mimbreño subdivision and principal chief of the Tchihende Apaches) and [[Cuchillo Negro]] (chief of the "Warm Springs" Mimbreño subdivision, with [[Nana (chief)|Nana]] as an able lieutenant, and second-ranking chief of the Tchihende Apaches); brave warrior and wise chief, he succeeded Mangas Coloradas as chief of the "Coppermine" [[Mimbreños]].
He was involved, as a primary actor, in Apache warfare until the middle 1860’ decade, along with his coetaneus [[Cochise]] (going to be the principal chief of the Tsokanende or [[Chiricahua]]) and [[Nana (capo Apache)|Nana]], and with some younger leaders as [[Victorio]], [[Loco (Apache)|Loco]], [[Juh]], [[Chihuahua (chief)|Chihuahua]], [[Geronimo]], but perhaps he never was the real principal leader of the whole [[Mimbreño]] people, since, in the meantime, younger [[Victorio]], Mangas Coloradas’s son-in-law, did get even higher fame and prestige because of his extraordinary and overwhelming abilities as a warrior and a warlord, succeeding Cuchillo Negro as chief of "Warm Springs" [[Mimbreños]] a tutti gli effetti (so going elderly Nana to be a precious and worthy lieutenant of the same Victorio).

Many times Delgadito stood side-by-side with Mangas Coloradas and Cuchillo Negro and acted for them in dealing with Northamericans or Mexicans. 
After parleys during the spring, in the summer 1850, at Janos, Delgadito and some other Mimbreño and Nednhi chiefs signed a treaty with Chihuahua representatives.

In June 1851 Delgadito, Ponce and Coleto Amarillo accompanied Mangas Coloradas to [[Santa Rita del Cobre]] to meet gen.  J.R. Bartlett, U.S. commissioner appointed by Washinhgton in the U.S.-Mexican border Commission, until the Apaches didn’t feel themselves disappointed and betrayed by the Anglo-American newcomers; in the same year 1851 Santa Rita del Cobre copper mines were reopened and white people (mostly miners) overran the area of Pinos Altos and Santa Rita, where Cuchillo Negro, imposing their rule and giving defence to the Mexicans according to the agreements with the Mexican Governmente.  In spite of the goodwill of the chiefs (Mangas Coloradas, Cuchillo Negro, Delgadito, Ponce and [[Coleto Amarillo]]), who repeatedly had to intervene to prevent any drastic reaction by the warriors, time going on, the connections became more and more difficult until the Apaches broke them.

'''Dilana Smith''' (born '''Dilana Jansen van Vuuren'''; 10 August 1972) is a South African singer, songwriter, and performer who lives in [[Los Angeles, California]]. She is best known as the runner-up contestant on the [[CBS]] reality television show ''[[Rock Star: Supernova]]''. She was the lead singer for [[Tracii Guns]]' version of [[L.A. Guns]] for a brief period in 2011.

== Biography ==
Dilana Jansen van Vuuren was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa on 10 August 1972. Her surname changed to Smith when she was about two years old, when her mother married her stepfather, and he adopted her. Dilana used singing as an escape from an unpleasant home scene, participating in school choir competitions and festivals, as well as church choir and fondue parties.

When the opportunity presented itself, Dilana dropped everything and started performing full-time, from a travelling duo, to a mixture of bands in South Africa and the [[Netherlands]]. Moving to the Netherlands, she formed her own band, focusing more on original works and becoming one of the country's highest paid live performers.&lt;ref name="Dilana Robichaux Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dilana-robichaux.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=29|title=Dilana Robichaux Biography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording her first album ''[[Wonderfool (album)|Wonderfool]]'' in 2000 led to four music videos, five singles and well over 200 gigs. She also sang the title tracks for two major motion pictures and performed in a festival in Belgium supporting [[Joe Cocker]] and [[Chevy Chase|Stuff]], [[K's Choice]] and [[Heather Nova]] to a crowd of more than 100,000 people. Dilana also performed at the [[2000 Sydney Olympics]], with Dutch performers.&lt;ref name="Dilana Robichaux Biography"/&gt;

== Supernova ==
Dilana was one of the finalists on the [[CBS]] reality television show of season two of ''[[Rock Star (TV series)|Rock Star]]'', where she finished runner-up to [[Lukas Rossi]]. The show is a competition in which the band chooses a lead singer from a group of contestants. Although Dilana received the most consistent praise for her performances of all the contestants, she came under fire from fans, her competition, and from [[Rock Star Supernova]] because of comments she made during a staged press conference, in which she was forthcoming with her opinion of her competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.chron.com/tubular/archives/2006/08/post_36.html|title=Dilana’s meltdown rocks Rock Star|date=24 August 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she apologised repeatedly for her remarks afterwards, it appears that her first "bottom three" appearance was a result of this controversy. The controversy seemed to die down by the end of the program; on the final night of voting, she was said to have received the highest number of votes at least at one point during the evening, and ended up with the second highest number overall. After the show, [[Gilby Clarke]] revealed that Lukas Rossi defeated Dilana because "he made [their] music sound more like a band, whereas Dilana sounded like a singer, with [[Rock Star Supernova]] backing her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/296895/dilana-the-reality-rocks-interview-pt-1/|title=Yahoo Music|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gigs and tours ===
Following her participation on ''[[Rock Star (TV series)|Rock Star]]'', Dilana performed various venues with fellow ''[[Rock Star: Supernova (TV series)|Rock Star: Supernova]]'' finalist [[Magni Ásgeirsson|Magni]]; with Magni, she won an FM957 People's Choice Award for "Gig of the Year" in January 2007. From November to December 2006, Dilana headlined her first independent tour in the United States, sponsored by [http://www.urok.com/ Urok] clothing, which also distributes and sells her new clothing line. From January to February 2007, she opened for the [[Rock Star Supernova (band)|Rock Star Supernova]] tour, playing an acoustic set with [[Magni Ásgeirsson|Magni]] on guitar. While critics generally panned [[Rock Star Supernova (band)|Rock Star Supernova]], Dilana's performances were met with positive reception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070208/ENT04/702080419/-1/ent05 http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070208/ENT04/702080419/-1/ent05] ''Desmoinesregister.com'' Retrieved on 06-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theedge.bostonherald.com/musicNews/view.bg?articleid=179869 http://theedge.bostonherald.com/musicNews/view.bg?articleid=179869] ''Theedge.bostonherald.com'' Retrieved on 06-06-07&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Rock Star Supernova (band)|Rock Star Supernova]] tour, Dilana performed at various locations awaiting another solo tour following the release of her album. This included opening for the band [[Aerosmith]] on 28 April 2007 at Mandalay Bay in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. In 2008, she performed at several charity events for Livin' the Music in Nashville, Los Angeles, and Baton Rouge.

Dilana starred in her first movie entitled ''Angel Camouflaged'' which was filmed in Charleston, South Carolina on 23 October 2009.  This was an independent project by a Beaufort, SC filmmaker. ''Angel Camouflaged'' was released on 28 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenvilleonline.com/article/20091019/YOURUPSTATE/910190352/1427/YOURUPSTATE01/News-and-Specials-from-SC-Film-Commission- News and Specials from SC Film Commission!]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the studio: ''Inside Out''===
{{Main|Inside Out (Dilana album)}}
Dilana new album ''Inside Out'' was digitally released on 17 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hardrockhideout.com/2009/10/28/dilanas-inside-out-gets-a-release-date/ http://hardrockhideout.com/2009/10/28/dilanas-inside-out-gets-a-release-date/] ''hardrockhideout.com'' Retrieved on 11-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inside Out'', originally entitled ''Darklight'', was recorded in Los Angeles and features No Doubt drummer Adrian Young, Mötley Crüe guitarist Mick Mars and producer [[Dave Bassett (songwriter)|Dave Bassett]]. Although Dilana signed a contract with London-based Hurricane Records (Hurricane Music Group Ltd) in early 2008 [2] and was finished with recording her new album already in mid 2008, it was not released by said record company. In a later update from Dilana on hardrockhideout.com [3] she announced that not only did she get released from her contract with HMG due to the label's shutdown but also that the master recordings did not belong to her. Dilana then went into negotiations with Kabunk Records, LLC. Although Dilana was unable to sign a deal with Kabunk, the label did purchase the rights to the Inside Out album and will be releasing the album digitally.

Reception of the album has been initially, very positive. Music Reviewer Albert Watson, from Metromix music, writes,

{{cquote|What happens when you combine a South African/Dutch singer (now based in L.A.), some aging rockers and a televised singing competition? This album! Sort of. Dilana didn't actually win ''Rock Star: Supernova'', but she did come close. Close enough, in fact, for [[No Doubt]] drummer [[Adrian Young]] and [[Mötley Crüe]] guitarist [[Mick Mars]] to help back her on this firecracker of a major-label debut. As one might expect, it's a polished, punchy set of alt-influenced hard rock that does everything it can to showcase Dilana's outsized set of pipes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://southflorida.metromix.com/music/essay_photo_gallery/new-music-in-stores/1602859/photo/1612179 New music: in stores and online: Dilana, "InsideOut"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other singles===
Dilana has also released a series of singles, many of which will not be included on her debut album. Dilana has released covers of [[Johnny Cash]]'s "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]" and [[The Police]] classic "[[Roxanne (song)|Roxanne]]". Dilana was also featured on a re-recording of "Black", a track on [[Gilby Clarke]]'s [[Gilby Clarke (album)|best-of album]] released 30 January. Dilana also released a version of "Killer Queen"; her version was featured on the final episode of the UK edition of ''When Woman Rule The World'' and the Women's Tennis Championship on Versus TV Network (formerly OLN) in November 2007. On Tuesday, 9 June 2009, Dilana released an original entitled "Hangover" on the [[AO Recordings]] label via iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aorecordings.com|title=AO Recordings Library Site - Michael Lord|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''American Idol'' connection===
In 2009, Dilana began to receive some national exposure because of ''[[American Idol]]'' as two contestants on the show credit her during post-''Idol'' interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/292983/a-rock-star-supernova-finally-blows-up-dilana-returns/|title=Yahoo Music|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[American Idol]]'' Season 8 contestant [[Adam Lambert]] sang an arrangement of "Ring of Fire" very similar to the one Dilana performed. In an interview with Michael Slezak of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Adam says he liked Dilana's arrangement a lot and that it was a source of inspiration for his cover of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUArz_z2mHo|title=Idolatry: Adam - Part 3|first=|last=Entertainment Weekly|date=11 June 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam's cover of "Ring of Fire" did not go unnoticed by Dilana nor her record label:

{{cquote|I am stoked that Adam Lambert from ''American Idol'' chose to use my version of Ring of fire on last night's episode.  It's an honor knowing that my arrangement and "Kashmir" version of the Johnny Cash classic "turned him on" to the point where he wanted to use it on the show.&lt;ref name=Kabunk&gt;Official press release from Kabunk Records, March 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Allison Iraheta]], another ''American Idol'' Season 8 contestant, covered Dilana's song "[[Holiday (Dilana song)|Holiday]]" on her debut album, ''[[Just Like You (Allison Iraheta album)|Just Like You]]'', slated for a 1 December 2009 release date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/11/04/allison-iraheta-just-like-you-songwriting/ http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/11/04/allison-iraheta-just-like-you-songwriting/] ''Ew.com'' Retrieved on 11-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Lyndsey Parker of [[Yahoo!| Yahoo! Music]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEcB_FMCUGI|title=YouTube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who tells Allison that her cover of "Holiday" is the song on ''Just Like You'' she's most excited about because it's a cover of a Dilana song, said,

{{cquote|I was a big fan of Dilana's ... I never watched the show, but I checked it out online once and I was like "Homegirl can sang!" ... Kinda crazy, I didn't know she was going to release that in her album ... I mean, I would have never covered it if I knew she was going to release it cause it's all her, but I think it definitely has room for both of us because we each bring something different to the table ... dear God, her voice is ridiculous; I love it ... I wish I could talk to her and be like, "Thanks for making such a dope-ass song! Wow. It's cool."}}

Later in the same interview, Allison said, "it is a little intimidating (to cover a song by someone you respect) at first cause I was like 'wow, this is so good,' but we're different." Dilana has said that Allison is "the only chic I would ever want to cover my song," calling her "so smart ... so talented" and saying that she had a "beautiful future ahead."&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitpic.com/q1w5g Dilana on Allison Iraheta]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Voice of Holland'' (2016) ===
Dilana participated in [[The Voice of Holland|The Voice Holland]], [[The Voice of Holland (season 7)|season 7]] (2016-2017) passing through the Blind Audition, The Battle rounds, but got sick on the day and left the show after The Knockout performance of "It Must Have Been Love".

'''Don Sebastiani''' is an [[United States|American]] [[vintner]] and [[politician]] from the state of [[California]].

Sebastiani grew up in [[Sonoma, California]]. Born to parents August and Sylvia Sebastiani, he was the youngest of three children, with older siblings Sam and Mary Ann. He attended St. Francis Solano School in Sonoma, Bellarmine Prep in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], and the [[University of San Francisco]] (USF). In 1975, he married fellow USF student Nancy Cecchetti, of San Francisco, with whom he had three children, Donny, August, and Mia.

Sebastiani served in the [[California State Assembly]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from the [[California's 8th State Assembly district|8th district]] from 1980 until 1986. In 1986, he ran in the primary for [[California State Controller]] but lost. Soon thereafter, he returned to Sonoma to run his family's wine business, Sebastiani Vineyards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winemag.com/Wine-Enthusiast-Magazine/August-2004/Sonomas-First-Family-of-Wine/ Sonoma's First Family of Wine]&lt;/ref&gt; where he took production from little more than 200,000 cases to just shy of 8 million in his 15 years at the helm. Also, in 1986, along with brother-in-law Roy Cecchetti, Sebastiani began a [[negociant]]-style winery, Cecchetti Sebastiani Cellar (CSC). CSC developed the label Pepperwood Grove and Don &amp; Roy grew their business to nearly 400,000 cases in 1999.

In the Spring of 2001, he left the old company and, along with his sons Donny and August, started Don Sebastiani &amp; Sons, developing well-known labels such as Smoking Loon and Plungerhead.

==Biography==
Dora van Gelder was born at a sugar cane plantation named Krebet near [[Jombang Regency|Djombang]] city on East [[Java]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwlworld.info/html/influence.html Pedro Oliveira, ''Dora van Gelder Kunz’s Testimony'', CWL World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219123944/http://www.cwlworld.info/html/influence.html |date=February 19, 2011 }}. Retrieved 01/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Karel van Gelder, was a chemist who ran the sugar plantation, and her mother, born Melanie van Motman, was from a very well-to-do Dutch family as well. Both her parents had been members of the [[Theosophical Society]] since 1900 and from the age of 5 meditation became a daily routine.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsten van Gelder, Frank Chesley, [https://catalog.krl.org/Mobile/BakerAndTaylor/Excerpt?ISBN=9780835609364&amp;UPC=9780835609364&amp;position=1 A Most Unusual Life. Dora Van Gelder Kunz: Clairvoyant, Theosophist, Healer], Theosophical Publishing House, 2015, {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0936-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dora claimed that since she was a child she interacted with [[Non-physical entity|ethereal beings]] and her mother was a strong believer in her [[clairvoyance]]. At eleven years old she moved to [[Mosman]], a suburb of [[Sydney]] (Australia),&lt;ref name="haunted"&gt;Peter Read, ''Haunted Earth'', 2003. p. 30. {{ISBN|0-86840-726-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to study with someone knowledgeable about her abilities, the then-Anglican clergyman and psychic [[C. W. Leadbeater]], who taught  her ways to increase her psychic skills.&lt;ref name="gale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theoso"&gt;[http://www.questbooks.net/author.cfm?authornum=63 Theosophical Publishing House, ''Dora van Gelder Kunz'', Theosophical Society in America. 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Sydney, Department of Religious Studies]. Chapter 22, pp. 846-847.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Through Leadbeater she met Fritz Kunz, who used to accompany Leadbeater on his travels. In 1927, at the age of twenty-two, Dora moved with Kunz to the United States where they married in [[Chicago]] on May 16. She was still a Dutch citizen but sometime after the marriage became a naturalized American. Her husband became the principal of a scholastic foundation and she became president of a corporation related to pedagogic supplies.&lt;ref name="gale"/&gt; Soon after coming to the USA, the couple founded the first [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] camp at [[Orcas Island]] in the state of Washington.&lt;ref name="theoso"/&gt;

[[File:Deva and Gryphon.jpg|upright|thumb|According to Dora van Gelder there exist powerful beings called [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] which transmit and direct energy to the nature.&lt;ref  name="nathaniel"&gt;Nathaniel Altman, ''The deva handbook: how to work with nature's subtle energies'', 1995. pp. 18,19, 124. {{ISBN|0-89281-552-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Fairy and Griffon"'' by [[Gustave Moreau]], 19th  century.]]

For many years, Dora dealt with new methods in healing, particularly [[therapeutic touch]],&lt;ref&gt;Tova Navarra and Adam M.D. Perlman, ''The encyclopedia of complementary and alternative medicine'', 2004,  p. 73. {{ISBN|0-8160-4997-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which she co-developed in 1972 with Dr. Dolores Krieger,&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Guiley, ''Encyclopedia of mystical &amp; paranormal experience,'' 1993, p. 69. {{ISBN|1-85627-322-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a nursing professor at [[New York University]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert T. Carroll, [http://www.skepdic.com/tt.html ''Therapeutic Touch - the Skeptic's Dictionary.'' Copyright 1994-2009].&lt;/ref&gt; which is said to promote healing, relaxation and lessen pain.&lt;ref name="gale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g2601/is_0013/ai_2601001343/ Leonard C. Bruno, ''Therapeutic touch - Encyclopedia of Medicine''. Article, 2001. Gale Research]. Retrieved 01/2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Therapeutic touch, stated Kunz, has its origin from ancient Yogic texts written in Sanskrit, which describe it as a [[pranic]] healing method.&lt;ref name="russel"/&gt; The technique is taught in approximately eighty colleges and universities in the U.S., and in more than seventy countries.&lt;ref name="russel"/&gt;

Kunz philanthropically directed her clairvoyance towards helping physicians in complicated medical cases,&lt;ref&gt;Von Braschler, ''Natural Pet Healing: Our Psychic, Spiritual Connection'', 2003. pp. 2,3. {{ISBN|1-931942-07-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular aiding in diagnoses through her capability of seeing the effects of diseases in the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of the patients. More specifically she reported the existence of centers of energy in human body, also known as [[chakras]], changing their colors according to diseases that affect matching [[endocrine glands]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyndi Dale, ''The Subtle Body: An Encyclopedia of Your Energetic Anatomy'', 2009, p. 249. {{ISBN|1-59179-671-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her followers believed she was able to predict some illness as many as eighteen months before symptoms manifest themselves.&lt;ref name="theoso"/&gt;

In 1975 Kunz became president of the [[Theosophical Society in America]]. In 1977 she published a book about her [[fairies|fairy]] experiences in her youth, "''The Real World of Fairies''", in which she stated that throughout her life she always kept in communication with [[nature spirits]].&lt;ref name="gale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nathaniel"/&gt; According to her, in 1979 she saw fairies in [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], but due to the increasing pollution it was getting more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Stein, ''The encyclopedia of the paranormal,'' 1996, p. 266. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunz claims that [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] are intimately connected with a vital energy, transmitting force to preserve and heal the Earth. She said as more people get involved with environmental causes, the better are the chances of communication between humans and devas.&lt;ref  name="nathaniel"/&gt; In 1987 after completing twelve years as president of the Theosophical Society in America, she retired and devoted herself to lecturing and writing.&lt;ref name="gale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theoso"/&gt;

==Criticism==
The healing method, the "Therapeutic Touch" conceived by Dolores Krieger and Dora Kunz in the early 1970s using the "human energy field"
was tested in 1996 by [[Emily Rosa]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} At age nine Rosa conceived and executed a scientific study{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} of therapeutic touch which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} It was a critique of all of the studies related to TT she could locate in nursing journals and elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} This made Rosa the youngest person to have a research paper published in a peer reviewed medical journal.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} She concluded as her opinion:&lt;br&gt;
''"The more rigorous the research design, the more detailed the statistical analysis, the less evidence that there is any observed—or observable—phenomenon."'' {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} She just could not see it.

'''Friedrich-Wend, Count of Eulenburg and Hertefeld''',&lt;ref&gt;Archiv für Stamm- und Wappenkunde (1905): [https://archive.org/stream/archivfurstammun06rheu#page/n47/mode/2up/search/eulenburg Bekanntmachung der Erhebung seines Vaters in den preußischen Fürstenstand]&lt;/ref&gt; known as Prince of Eulenburg and Hertefeld, Count of Sandels (19 September 1881 in [[Starnberg]] &amp;ndash; 1 August 1963 at [[Hertefeld Castle]] in [[Weeze]]), was a German aristocratic farmer and estate owner of Liebenberg and Häsen in ([[Brandenburg]]) as well as [[Hertefeld Castle|Hertefeld]] and the Castle of Kolk ([[Lower Rhine region|Niederrhein]]).

==Origin and education==

Friedrich-Wend was the oldest surviving son of [[Philip, Prince of Eulenburg]] (1847 - 1921) and his wife Augusta, born Countess of Sandels (1853 - 1941), daughter of Samuel, the last Count of Sandels, and Augusta of Tersmeden.
On account of his father's diplomatic duties he spent his childhood and school days in Starnberg, [[Oldenburg]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[Vienna]]. On attaining his [[Abitur]], Friedrich-Wend joined the [[1st Guards Infantry Division (German Empire)|1st Guards Infantry Division]] in 1902 and a year later the [[Kriegsschule (Wehrmacht)|Kriegsschule]] in [[Engers]]. In 1906 he withdrew from the military with the rank of Lieutenant of Reserves.

During his time in Vienna he had met his later wife, the Austrian Marie von Mayr-Melnhof (1884 -1960). Marie came from the family of the Barons of Mayr von Melnhof that had risen in society very rapidly some decades before; having been the peasants Mayr of the Melnhof, they succeeded in paving the way for the industrialisation of [[Styria]], and thus acquired a vast fortune. This fortune was invested in large areas of forestry and formed the basis of the [[Mayr-Melnhof]] company today.

==Marriage, the Harden-Eulenburg affair and World War I==

Wedding of Friedrich-Wend and Marie took place on 21 My 1904 at Liebenberg in the presence of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]]. Because of the bride's Catholic confession, it had been a problematic union, as Wilhelm II had elevated his friend Philip zu Eulenberg to the rank of prince just a few years earlier in an attempt to create parity between the Catholic and Protestant peers of the empire. The impending marriage appeared to threaten this equilibrium, whereupon Wilhelm at first forbade it. The Emperor himself thereupon sought a solution by asking Pope [[Pius X]] to grant an exception. This led to the marriage being celebrated in both confessions and all the children were later baptised in the Protestant faith. Immediately thereafter, between 1904 and 1906 the so-called Lake House, was built for the young couple on the shores of a lake close to the family estate, the costs being met by the bridal dowry.

After his wedding, Friedrich-Wend set out on a course of agricultural studies at the University of [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], that he was, however, unable to complete. The dramatic events of [[Harden-Eulenburg affair]] involving his father in the period between 1907 and 1909 made it necessary for him to be present with his family, for the two older sons were often called upon to physically protect their father from the surge of [[Paparazzi]]. The family doctor, Wilhelm zur Linden, writes in his memoirs that he was still treating the after-effects of the shock in Friedrich-Wend in the year 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm zur Linden: ''Blick durchs Prisma - Lebensbericht eine Arztes''. Vittorio Klostermann, Frankfurt 1963, S. 47-51.&lt;/ref&gt; So at the age of 26, Friedrich-Wend took over full responsibility for the family affairs, erecting a brickworks the following year and beginning with the mechanisation of the agricultural estate.

In the course of the general mobilisation, he was called for active service in August 1914. His regiment advanced through [[Belgium]] and reached [[Ghent]] during the offensive, after which he was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 1st. Class. Soon after this he was poisoned by locals. For months he could only take in fluids and only regained his health after many years. In June 1915 his younger brother, [[Botho Sigwart zu Eulenburg|Botho Sigwart]] fell in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] when a shot pierced his lung. His death brought considerable consequences for the family, who had been close to [[Rudolf Steiner]] and received him as guest at Liebenberg estate occasionally since 1906. Sigwart had been an avid student of [[Anthroposophy]] together with two of his sisters, Tora and Lyki and with his sister-in-law, Marie, the wife of Friedrich-Wend. Soon after he died, they felt he was trying to communicate with them from the world beyond, made extensive notes and showed these to Rudolf Steiner. The three volumes ''Bridge Over the River'' give an account of these communications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sigwart.weebly.com/ ''Bridge Across the River'' translated by Joseph Bailey]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[World War I|First World War]], things changed considerably also for the circumstances at Liebenberg, which was no longer competitive. Friedrich-Wend, heir to the title after the death of his father in 1921, engaged an external consultant in 1925, Rudolf, Baron of Engelhardt-Schönheyden, under whose management the estate was successfully upgraded. In 1926 Engelhardt married the daughter of his employer, Ingeborg, Countess zu Eulenburg and moved with her into one wing of the Lake House.

==The family under the National Socialist regime==

As a monarchist, Eulenburg was a member of and involved with the conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP). He soon realised, however, that the influence of the large landowners could only be maintained if they had broad basis of support amongst the masses. He saw in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP), that had already outdistanced the DNVP during the 1930 elections, a political force that could secure this broad popular consent. He therefore met with [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1931 in order to address the interests of the big landowners: 
:"In order to clarify this question I decided to seek out Adolf Hitler personally in order to hear directly out of his mouth what we could expect from him."&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Müller: ''Liebenberg - Ein verkauftes Dorf''. Im Selbstverlag BoD, 2003, S. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

After this conversation, Friedrich-Wend believed to have found in Hitler the right man to secure his aims. He thereupon wrote to the other landowners so as to encourage them to join the NSDAP: 
:"If we do not wish to embrace [[Bolshevism]] we have no other choice but to enter into this party which, despite many socialist ideas, is the counter-pole of [[Marxism]] and Bolshevism."&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Müller, op. cit., S. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a member of the party himself and the bulk of the population of Liebenberg later followed his example. His son-in-law, Baron von Engelhardt, had already some years earlier founded a Liebenberg branch of the [[National Socialist Motor Corps]] (NSKK), organising field games and battle exercises.

The Eulenburg's neighbour on the next estate was [[Hermann Göring]], who had built a country residence, [[Carinhall]] in the [[Schorfheide (municipality)|Schorfheide forest]] nearby. He would at times join the deer hunting on the Liebenberg estate. It was during one of these stays at Liebenberg that the niece of Eulenburg, [[Libertas Schulze-Boysen]], who had spent the decisive years of her childhood with the family at Liebenberg, spoke to Göring on behalf of her fiancé, [[Harro Schulze-Boysen]]. He was in a subordinate position in Göring's [[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]], the Ministry of Aviation, and shortly after this he was promoted. The couple were married in 1936 at Liebenberg. Six years later, Harro and Libertas were identified as the heads of the resistance group [[Red Orchestra (espionage)|Rote Kapelle]], by the [[Gestapo]] and executed in December 1942 at [[Plötzensee Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Steinbach und Johannes Tuchel: ''Lexikon des Widerstandes 1933–1945''. C.H. Beck; 2. überarb. u. erw. Auflage, 1998, S. 178f&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction, the only son of Friedrich-Wend, Wend, Count of Eulenburg (1908-1986), who had up to that point been classified as "u.K." (indispensable), at once received his call-up papers to a [[Strafbattalion]] (penal battalion), unit that experienced an extraordinarily high rate of casualties, and was sent to the Eastern Front to combat partisans. His father continued ceaselessly to attempt to secure his transfer and Wend eventually was moved into a tank battalion that was completely wiped out during the Allied invasion of [[Salerno]]. He survived the war and was taken prisoner in April 1945 by American troops near [[Como]].

Prior to this, in 1941, Prince Eulenburg had already drawn the attention of the Nazi authorities when he signed a petition calling for the release of the priests of the [[Christian Community]], who had been arrested as a body by the Gestapo on 10 June 1941, the churches prohibited and their property confiscated. Other notable signatories to the petition were the operatic soprano, [[Marta Fuchs]], the two marine captains [[Helmuth von Ruckteschell]] and [[Hans Erdmenger]] together with his wife, as well as a few officials from some of the ministries. The priests had been released from captivity some two months later, but the signatories' names had been noted by the Gestapo.&lt;ref&gt;''Anthroposophen in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus (1933-1945)'' Uwe Werner, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag 24. März 1999 {{ISBN|978-3486563627}} P. 440&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fleeing to West Germany, rebuilding and death==

Friedrich-Wend and his wife fled in April 1945 as the last of the family to leave Liebenberg right before the invasion of the [[Red Army]] troops. They spent the next years on their estate of Gut Kaden in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] while the Soviet military administration of Germany confiscated their properties in Liebenberg and Häsen. The family estates of Hertefeld and Kolk, as well as the forestry and hunting estates of his wife Marie in Austria were either destroyed or occupied by refugees.

By 1947 Friedrich Wend had once again built up the revenue administration of the main estate, Hertefeld, while his son Wend re-established the agricultural concerns. When the last refugees had left the estate in [[Hinterstoder]], [[Upper Austria]] the family could once again take possession of it. Prince Eulenburg devoted the last years of his life to his family and to the hunt until his death on 1 August 1963 at Hertefeld, where he lies buried next to his wife, Marie, who had preceded him in 1961.

Sabu was identified by Backtrace Security as "Hector Monsegur" on March 11, 2011 in a PDF publication named "Namshub".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Roberts |first=Paul |url=http://threatpost.com/chats-car-crushes-and-cut-n-paste-sowed-seeds-lulzsecs-demise-030712/76298 |title=Chats, Car Crushes and Cut 'N Paste Sowed Seeds Of LulzSec's Demise |publisher=Threatpost.com |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2011, an anonymous [[pastebin]] post claimed to identify Sabu as Hector Xavier Monsegur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pastebin.com/iVujX4TR |title=Untitled |publisher=pastebin |date=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a man of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Biddle |first=Sam (agencies)0964/who-is-sabu-updated |title=Who Is Sabu?

As an informant, Monsegur provided the FBI with details enabling the arrest of five other hackers associated with the groups Anonymous, LulzSec and Antisec.&lt;ref name=lulzsec_court_papers_reveal&gt;{{cite news |last=Ball |first=James |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/06/lulzsec-court-papers-sabu-anonymous?intcmp=239 |title=LulzSec court papers reveal extensive FBI co-operation with hackers |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bonderud |first=Douglas |url=http://www.theinfoboom.com/articles/former-lulzsec-headman-turns-informant-to-help-bust-bad-guys |title=Former Lulzsec Headman Turns Informant To Help Bust Bad Guys |date=March 15, 2012 |publisher=Infoboom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317074826/http://www.theinfoboom.com/articles/former-lulzsec-headman-turns-informant-to-help-bust-bad-guys/ |archivedate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI provided its own servers for the hacking to take place.&lt;ref name=lulzsec_court_papers_reveal/&gt; Information Monsegur provided also resulted in the arrest of two UK hackers: James Jeffery and Ryan Cleary.&lt;ref name=lulzsec_sabu_freedom&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomson |first=Iain |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/23/lulzsec_sabu_freedom/ |title=LulzSec sneak Sabu buys six more months of freedom |newspaper=[[The Register]] |date=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI attempted to use Monsegur to entrap [[Nadim Kobeissi]], author of the secure communication software [[Cryptocat]], but without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Somini | last=Sengupta | title=A Hacker Charms and Disappoints | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/a-hacker-charms-and-disappoints/ | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsegur maintained his pretense until March 6, 2012, even tweeting his "opposition" to the federal government until the very last. The final day's tweets included, "The feds at this moment are scouring our lives without warrants. Without judges approval. This needs to change. Asap" and "The federal government is run by a bunch of fucking cowards. Don't give in to these people. Fight back. Stay strong".&lt;ref name=lulzsec_court_papers_reveal/&gt; On March 6, 2012, the FBI announced the arrests of five male suspects: two from Britain, two from Ireland and one from the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0306/anonymous.html |title=Dublin arrest in 'Anonymous' probe |date=March 6, 2012 |publisher=RTÉ News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabu has not been explicitly linked to the group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. The extent of crossover between the members of such [[hacktivist]] groups, however, is uncertain. Anonymous reacted to Sabu's unmasking and betrayal of LulzSec on Twitter, "#Anonymous is a hydra, cut off one head and we grow two back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Covert |first=Adrian |url=https://gizmodo.com/5890961/anonymous-reacts-to-sabus-betrayal-of-lulzsec |title=Anonymous Reacts to Sabu’s Betrayal of LulzSec |publisher=Gizmodo |date=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Fishman of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine said "On the Internet, Monsegur was now a reviled figure. At Jacob Riis, it was a different story. Those who knew him growing up were shocked—he was always 'respectful,' they said. But also, they were a little proud. In their eyes, he was a kid from the projects who'd achieved a certain success. He'd gotten out, finally."&lt;ref name=Fishman6&gt;{{cite web |last=Fishman |first=Steve |title='Hello, I Am Sabu ...' |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=June 11, 2012 |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/lulzsec-sabu-2012-6/index5.html |page=6 |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A court filing made by prosecutors in late May 2014 revealed Monsegur had prevented 300 [[Cyber-attack|cyber attacks]] in the three years since 2011, including planned attacks on [[NASA]], the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] and media companies. "Monsegur's consistent and corroborated historical information, coupled with his substantial proactive cooperation and other evidence developed in the case, contributed directly to the identification, prosecution, and conviction of eight of his major co-conspirators, including [[Jeremy Hammond]], who at the time of his arrest was the FBI's number one cyber-criminal target in the world," a sentencing memo among the documents filed said.&lt;ref name="SabuFBI"&gt;{{cite news|title=LulzSec hacker helped FBI stop over 300 cyber attacks|url=http://www.bignewsnetwork.com/index.php/sid/222347973/scat/3a8a80d6f705f8cc/ht/LulzSec-hacker-helped-FBI-stop-over-300-cyber-attacks|accessdate=May 26, 2014|publisher=''Big News Network''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsegur served 7 months in prison after his arrest but had been free since then while awaiting sentencing. At his sentencing on May 27, 2014, he was given "time served" for co-operating with the FBI and set free under one year of probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/hacker-helped-feds-gets-no-more-time-prison-163849732.html |title=Hacker who helped feds gets no more time in prison |work=Yahoo News |agency=Associated Press |author=Larry Neumeister |date=May 27, 2014 |accessdate=May 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527221033/https://news.yahoo.com/hacker-helped-feds-gets-no-more-time-prison-163849732.html |archivedate=May 27, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henrietta Clive, Countess of Powis.jpg|thumb|Lady Clive in 1777, by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]
'''Henrietta Antonia Clive, Countess of Powis''' (née '''Lady Henrietta Antonia Herbert'''; 3 September 1758 – 3 June 1830), was a British writer, [[mineral collecting|mineral collector]] and [[botany|botanist]]. Her time in India, while her husband was [[Governor of Madras]], was inspirational to her for all three of these pursuits.

== Family ==
[[File:The Earl and Countess of Powis with their family.jpg|thumb|Lady Henrietta with her parents and brother in 1760]]
Born in Oakley Park, at [[Bromfield, Shropshire]], into a landed and titled family, she was the daughter of [[Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis]], and [[Barbara Herbert, Countess of Powis|Barbara]], granddaughter of [[William Herbert, 2nd Marquess of Powis]]. Her family owned a property in London and significant estates in Wales and Shropshire. Her birthplace was sold to [[Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive]], in 1771, so Lady Henrietta spent her teenage years at the family's ancestral home, [[Powis Castle]].&lt;ref name="Tom"&gt;Cotterell, Tom. ''[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/countess_of_powis/ The fabulous mineral collection of Lady Henrietta Antonia Clive, Countess of Powis.]'' National Museum Wales, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sally"&gt;Williams, Sally. ''[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2010/12/03/laid-bare-the-passions-and-obsessions-of-lady-henrietta-a-19th-century-rock-chick-91466-27758004/ Laid bare the passions and obsessions of Lady Henrietta, a 19th-century rock chick]'' Wales Online 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Henrietta married Lord Clive's eldest son and heir, [[Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis|Edward Clive, 1st Baron Clive]], in 1784. The marriage was beneficial to both families; the bride's family had a prestigious name but considerable debts, while the groom accrued wealth built during Clive's military campaigns in India. The couple settled in Walcot Hall, at [[Lydbury North]] near [[Bishop's Castle]], Shropshire. Their four children were:&lt;ref name="Tom"/&gt;

*Lady Henrietta Antonia Williams-Wynn (d. 1835), wife of [[Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 5th Baronet|Sir Watkins Williams-Wynn, 5th Baronet]]
*[[Edward Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis|Edward Herbert]] (1785–1848), 2nd Earl of Powis
*[[Charlotte Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Charlotte Florentia Percy]] (1787–1866), wife of [[Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland]], and governess of the future [[Queen Victoria]]
*[[Robert Clive (1789–1854)|Robert Henry Clive]] (1798–1854), a politician

Lady Clive inherited the Herbert estates upon the death of her brother, [[George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis]], in 1801, when the Earldom became extinct. Three years later, it was recreated in favour of her husband, making her Countess of Powis.

The Countess of Powis died at Walcot Hall in 1830 aged 71 and was buried at [[St Mary the Virgin's Church, Bromfield|Bromfield Parish Church]], near Oakley Park.  Her husband survived her, dying in 1839.&lt;ref name=compeerage&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Peerage, Volume X|year=1945|publisher=St Catherine's Press|page=653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mineral collection and botany ==

In 1798, Lord Clive was appointed [[Governor of Madras]]. Lady Clive followed him to India where she started collecting rocks and minerals,&lt;ref name="Tom"/&gt; as the first aristocratic woman to pursue that hobby.&lt;ref name="Sally"/&gt; As her collection was growing, Lady Clive contacted prominent collectors and mineral dealers, such as [[James Sowerby]], [[John MacCulloch]] and the [[Louisa Finch, Countess of Aylesford|Countess of Aylesford]]. Her records show that many specimens had been given to her by her children. The minerals in Lady Clive's collection, numbering up to 1,000, are arranged systematically by chemistry, as was usual in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Tom"/&gt; In 1817, she organised her collection in two handwritten catalogues, using numbers to identify each specimen and helping the collection remain remarkably complete to this day. A quarter of the original collection is now kept at the [[National Museum Wales]] as one of the most important historic mineral collections,&lt;ref name="Tom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sally"/&gt; having been donated by her great-grandson, [[George Herbert, 4th Earl of Powis]], in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitcardiff.com/events/calendar-highlights/search-products/the-fabulous-mineral-collection-of-lady-henrietta-antonia-herbert-countess-of-powis-p145691 The Fabulous Mineral Collection of Lady Henrietta Antonia Herbert, Countess of Powis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arriving in India, Lady Powis also created a garden and kept a record of the plants in the area of [[Mysore]] and the [[Carnatic region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hagglund |first=Betty |year=2011|title=The Botanical Writings of Maria Graham |journal=Journal of Literature and Science|volume=4|issue=1|pages=44–58|url=http://literatureandscience.research.glam.ac.uk/media/files/documents/2011-10-28/JLS_4.1_Hagglund_44-58.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Lady Clive's Journals are one of the very first written accounts of India by a British woman. Published as ''Birds of Passage'', they were an important milestone in the emergence of female travel writers to join and challenge their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birds of Passage|url=http://www.travelbooks.co.uk/shop-online-books/birds-of-passage|website=Eland Books|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hu Hanmin''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|胡|漢|民}}|s=胡汉民|p=Hú Hànmín|first=t}}; born in [[Panyu]], [[Guangdong]], [[Qing dynasty]], China, December 9, 1879 – [[Guangdong]], [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], May 12, 1936) was one of the early conservative right factional leaders in the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) during revolutionary China.

==Biography==
Hu was of [[Hakka]] ancestry from Ji'an, Jiangxi. His father had moved to Panyu, Guangdong to take up an official post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 胡汉民 为何能是孙中山的得力助手 | url=http://m.secretchina.com/node/535592}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was qualified as [[juren]] at 21 years of age. He studied in [[Japan]] starting in 1902, and joined the [[Tongmenghui]] (Chinese Revolutionary Alliance) in 1905 as an editor of the newspaper [[Min Bao]]. From 1907 to 1910, he participated in several armed revolutions. Shortly after the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, he was appointed the governor of [[Guangdong]] and chief secretary of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Provisional Government]]. He participated in the [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] in 1913, and followed [[Sun Yat-sen]] to Japan after the failure of that revolution. There they established the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party). Hu lived in Guangdong between 1917 and 1921 and worked for Sun Yat-sen, as the minister of transportation first and principal consultant later.

Hu was elected to be a central executive committee member in the first conference of the Kuomintang in January, 1924. In September, he acted as vice generalissimo, when Sun Yat-sen left [[Guangzhou]] to [[Shaoguan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHINA: Swath to Success|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=July 23, 1934|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747553,00.html|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun died in Beijing in March, 1925, and Hu was one of the three most powerful figures in the Kuomintang. The other two were [[Wang Jingwei]] and [[Liao Zhongkai]]. Liao was assassinated in August of the same year, and Hu was suspected and arrested. After the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|Ninghan split]] in 1927, Hu supported [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and was head of the [[Legislative Yuan]] in Nanjing.

Later on February 28, 1931, Hu was placed under house arrest by Chiang because of disputes over the new provisional constitution.  Internal party pressure forced Chiang to release him.  After that, Hu became a powerful leader in South China, holding three political principles of resistance: resistance against Japanese invasion and massacre, resistance against militarist Communists, and finally resistance against the self-proclaimed leader, Chiang Kai-shek. The anti-Chiang factions in the KMT converged on Guangzhou to set up a rival government.  They demanded Chiang's resignation from his dual posts of [[President of the ROC|president]] and [[Premier of the ROC|premier]].  Civil war was averted by the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]].  Hu continued to rule southern China, the heartland of the KMT, with the help of [[Chen Jitang]] and the [[New Guangxi clique]].  There he attempted to create a model government free of corruption and cronyism to discredit Chiang's Nanjing regime.

Hu was an advocate of action against Japanese aggression, criticizing Chiang for "his spineless failure to adopt a strong policy towards the foreign power which has torn and ravaged our homeland!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CHINA: Swath to Success|author= |newspaper=TIME|date=July 23, 1934|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747553,00.html|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hu visited [[Europe]] and stopped his political attack on Chiang Kai-shek in June, 1935. In the first session of the fifth conference of Kuomintang in December 1935, he was absently elected as the Chair of Central Committee of Common Affairs. Hu returned to China in January, 1936, and lived in Guangzhou until he died of [[cerebral hemorrhage]] on May 12, 1936.

His death sparked a crisis.  Chiang wanted to replace Hu with loyal followers in southern China and end the autonomy the south enjoyed under Hu.  As a result, Chen and the New Guangxi clique conspired to remove Chiang from office.  In the so-called "[[Liangguang]] Incident", Chen was forced to resign as governor of Guangdong after Chiang bribed many of Chen's officers to defect and the conspiracy collapsed.

Hu's [[political philosophy]] was that one's individual rights are a function of one's membership in a nation.

'''Julius Hoste Jr.''' (1884–1954), was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] businessman and liberal politician.

He went to highschool at the ''Koninklijk Atheneum'' (E: Royal Atheneum) of [[Brussels]]. In 1902 he started at the [[Universite Libre de Bruxelles]] (ULB), where he obtained a law degree in 1907. Already as a student he had become interested in the [[Flemish movement]], like his father [[Julius Hoste Sr.]] While he was a student, he was a member of ''Geen Taal, Geen Vrijheid'', and together with [[Nico Gunzburg]] and [[Frans Van Cauwelaert]], he founded the ''Algemeen Vlaams Studentenbond''.

==Career==
After Hoste graduated, he worked shortly for the bar, but soon started working for the newspaper company founded by his father, which published newspapers such as [[Het Laatste Nieuws]], ''De Vlaamsche Gazet van Brussel'' and ''De Zweep'' (a Flemish weekly). In 1909, he cofounded the ''Liberale Volksbond'' of the district Brussels. This organization was founded in reaction to the ''Franskiljonism'' of the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]] of Brussels. In 1913, he also participated in the foundation of the [[Liberaal Vlaams Verbond]].

During [[World War I]], he lived in the [[Netherlands]]. He worked for the newspaper ''De Vlaamsche Stem'' until it began German-sponsored [[activism]]. In reaction he and [[Frans Van Cauwelaert]] founded the newspaper ''Vrij België''. Together they also founded the ''Vlaams-Belgisch Verbond'', and worked on the ''minimumprogramma'' (E: minimum-program) to establish linguistic uniformity in [[Flanders]] (Dutch) and [[Wallonia]] (French), Dutch-language usage in Flanders for education, administration, justice and army. After the war this remained the program for the ''Vlaams-Belgisch Verbond''.

After the war Hoste took over the management of the publishing company, and ''Het Laatste Nieuws'' became the most popular newspaper in Flanders. The success of the newspaper stood in strong contrast to the bad results for the liberals in Brussels in the elections of 1920. Julius Hoste would become president of the ''Algemene Belgische persbond'' (1935–1936), and secretary of the ''Verbond der Brusselse dagbladbestuurders'' (1939).

In 1935 he entered the political scene, and campaigned against the [[fascist]] parties Rex and VNV, and in 1936 became ''Minister of Education'' in the second government of [[Paul Van Zeeland]]. While he was in office, he founded the [[Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van België voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten|Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie voor Wetenschappen, Letteren en Schone Kunsten]] and a Dutch and French ''cultural council'' (1938).

During [[World War II]] he stayed in [[Great Britain]], where he became the under-secretary for education in the Belgian government in exile. After the war, he helped reestablish the ''Liberale Volksbond'' and the [[Liberaal Vlaams Verbond]]. In 1947, he was one of the main authors of the [[Oxford Manifesto]] on liberalism. In 1949 he was chosen as liberal [[Senate of Belgium|senator]] for Brussels, which he remained until his death in 1954. As a politician he paid attention to the problems of the Belgian communities (Flanders and Wallonia) and world peace during the [[Cold War]].

'''James Lance Bass''' ({{IPAc-en|b|æ|s}}; born May 4, 1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/lance-bass-mn0001330002 |title=Lance Bass |publisher=[[AllMusic.com]] |access-date=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American singer, dancer, actor, film and television producer, and author. He grew up in [[Mississippi]] and rose to fame as the [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] singer for the American pop [[boy band]] [[NSYNC]]. NSYNC's success led Bass to work in film and television. He starred in the 2001 film [[On the Line (2001 film)|''On the Line'']], which his company, Bacon &amp; Eggs, also produced.&lt;ref name="On The Line IMDB"&gt;{{IMDb title|0279286|On The Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bass later formed a second production company, Lance Bass Productions,&lt;ref name="Cosmonaut 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Space Week Biography of Lance Bass |url=http://www.spaceweek.org/lance_s_bio.html |publisher=WorldSpaceWeek.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622131650/http://www.spaceweek.org/lance_s_bio.html |archivedate=June 22, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a now-defunct [[Talent manager#Music managers|music management]] company, Free Lance Entertainment, a joint venture with [[Mercury Records]].&lt;ref name="FreeLance"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stark, Phyllis. |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4637401-1.html |date=May 27, 2000 |title=Mercury Nashville, Free Lance Label Pact |accessdate=September 19, 2007 |work=Billboard |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104200351/http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4637401-1.html |archive-date=November 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
James Lance Bass was born in [[Laurel, Mississippi]], to James Irvin Bass, Jr., a [[medical technologist]], and Diane (née Pulliam), a [[Primary education|middle school]] mathematics, English, and career discovery teacher.&lt;ref name=Autobio2&gt;{{cite book |last=Bass |first=Lance |title=Out of Sync |year=2007 |publisher=[[Simon Spotlight Entertainment]] |location=New York, Los Angeles |isbn=978-1-4169-4788-2 |pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rootsweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boards.rootsweb.com/surnames.bass/2197/mb.ashx |title=Lance Bass (former 'N Sync member)|publisher=Ancestry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his older sister, Stacy, Bass grew up in adjacent [[Ellisville, Mississippi]], and was raised as a [[Southern Baptist]].&lt;ref name="Sports Hollywood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportshollywood.com/askbass.html |title=10 Questions with Lance Bass |accessdate=September 27, 2007 |last=Bailey |first=Karen |author2=Jeff Hause  |year=2000 |publisher=Sports Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FishelRelationship"&gt;{{cite web |author=Westhoff, Ben |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2007/10/odyssey_with_lance_bass.php  |title=Odyssey With Lance Bass |accessdate=October 26, 2007 |work=The Dallas Observer}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bass has described his family as devoutly Christian and conservative&lt;ref name="DelawareOnline"&gt;{{cite web|author=Cormier, Ryan. |date=November 5, 2007 |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071105/LIFE/711050312/1005/LIFE |title=Straight Talk From Lance Bass |publisher=Delaware Online |accessdate=November 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108222437/http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071105%2FLIFE%2F711050312%2F1005%2FLIFE |archivedate=November 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has said that his childhood was "extremely happy".&lt;ref name="Autobio2" /&gt; As a young boy, Bass developed an interest in [[outer space|space]], and at age 9 traveled to [[Cape Canaveral, Florida]], with his father to watch his first live [[space shuttle]] launch.

When Bass was 11 years old, his father was transferred to a different hospital, and the family moved to [[Clinton, Mississippi]]&lt;ref name="Autobio2" /&gt; Bass began singing in his Baptist [[church choir]], and was encouraged to audition for local performance groups by his childhood best friend, Darren Dale,&lt;ref name=Autobio10-19&gt;{{cite book|last = Bass|first = Lance|title = Out of Sync|pages = 10–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest child of former longtime Mississippi Insurance Commissioner George Dale. Bass joined the Mississippi Show Stoppers, a statewide music group sponsored by the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum, and the [[Attaché Show Choir]], a national-award-winning competitive [[show choir]] group at [[Clinton High School (Clinton, Mississippi)|Clinton High School]]. He was also a member of a seven-man vocal group named Seven Card Stud, which competed at state fairs and performed at several social and political events for [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Trent Lott]].&lt;ref name="Autobio10-19" /&gt;

At Clinton High School, Bass was elected vice president of his junior class&lt;ref name="Autobio10-19" /&gt; and has said that he performed well in [[mathematics|math]] and science.&lt;ref name="Sports Hollywood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EDGE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=entertainment&amp;sc=celebrities&amp;sc2=features&amp;sc3=&amp;id=51657| title=Lance Bass on Britney, those skeevy Lou Pearlman allegations, and why he said Bye, Bye, Bye to the closet|date=October 29, 2007|publisher=EDGE Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bass later stated that his primary focus during high school was singing, and when looking back, he remembers "hardly anything" about academia.&lt;ref name="Autobio10-19" /&gt;

==Career==

===Music===
Bass's music career has consisted primarily of his singing with [[NSYNC]] and running a small management company.

====NSYNC====
{{Main|NSYNC}}
In 1995, during his junior year of high school, Bass received a call from [[Justin Timberlake]] and his mother, Lynn Harless, who asked Bass if he would be interested in auditioning for the pop group [[NSYNC]] after the group's original bass singer, Jason Galasso, had quit.&lt;ref name="Boltz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/59733/episode_about.jhtml|title=VH1's Driven's 'N Sync Episode Summary|publisher=VH1.com|accessdate=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timberlake's vocal coach (who had worked with Bass during his time as a Mississippi Show Stopper) recommended Bass as a replacement.&lt;ref name="Sports Hollywood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larry King"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Westbrook"&gt;{{cite news| author=Schruers, Fred| url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,276157,00.html| title = 'N The Drivers Seat| work=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate =December 5, 2007| date=May 19, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bass was accepted into the group after auditioning in front of the other bandmembers and [[Lou Pearlman]], and soon left school to move to [[Orlando, Florida]], and rehearse full-time.&lt;ref name=Autobio28-43&gt;{{cite book|last = Bass|first = Lance|title = Out of Sync|pages = 28–30, 35–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bass has said that he did not know how to dance before he joined NSYNC, and therefore found much of the group's choreography difficult to learn.&lt;ref name="Larry King" /&gt; According to an episode of [[VH1]]'s ''Driven'', Jan Boltz, president of [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]'s German division, offered NSYNC a [[record contract|recording contract]] under the condition that they replace Bass, whose dancing, he felt, "wasn't at the same level as all the others."&lt;ref name="Boltz" /&gt; However, the other members of the group refused to accept the contract without Bass, and the group's manager, [[Johnny Wright (music manager)|Johnny Wright]], convinced Bolz that Bass's dancing would quickly improve.&lt;ref name="Boltz" /&gt; Bolz conceded, and the group soon moved to [[Munich]], Germany to record their first album with BMG.&lt;ref name="Autobio28-43" /&gt; 'N Sync began extensive touring in Europe, and Bass's mother quit her job to tour with the group as a [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]], as Bass was still a [[minor (law)|minor]].&lt;ref name="Autobio28-43" /&gt;
[[File:Lancebass2001.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Lance Bass in 2001]]
After gaining significant notability in Europe, NSYNC was signed to American record label [[RCA]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="Autobio28-43" /&gt; The group's first single, "[[I Want You Back (NSYNC song)|I Want You Back]]" began receiving major radio play in the United States, and NSYNC soon found themselves becoming an "overnight sensation", a period which Bass describes in his autobiography as "the death of my own innocence".&lt;ref name="Autobio28-43" /&gt; Along with increasing fame and recognition in the United States the band also experienced a highly publicized legal battle with Pearlman, due to what the group believed were illicit business practices on his part.&lt;ref name="Pearlman1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Manning, Kara |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432531/19991124/n_sync.jhtml |title='N Sync Scores Small Victory As Legal Battle Begins |work=MTV News | date=November 24, 1999|accessdate=October 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSYNC sued Pearlman and his record company, Trans Continental, for [[fraud|defrauding]] the group of more than 50% of their earnings, rather than his original promise of only receiving one-sixth of the profits.&lt;ref name="Pearlman1" /&gt; The group threatened to leave and sign with [[Jive Records]], which prompted Pearlman and RCA to countersue NSYNC for $150&amp;nbsp;million US, citing [[breach of contract]].&lt;ref name="Countersuit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84723,00.html|title='N Sync are sued for $150&amp;nbsp;million|date=October 13, 1999|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|author=Wolk, Josh|accessdate=December 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injunction was thrown out of court&lt;ref name="Pearlman1" /&gt; and, after winning back their earnings, NSYNC signed with Jive.&lt;ref name="Jive"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Zomba-Records-Ltd-Company-History.html| title =Zomba Records, LTD: Company History| publisher =FundingUniverse.com| accessdate =December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2000, NSYNC released ''[[No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)|No Strings Attached]]'', which became the fastest-selling record of all time,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |title='N Sync ''Celebrity'' Review | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/d3n8/ | publisher=BBC | accessdate=July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; selling 1.1&amp;nbsp;million copies in its first day of release.&lt;ref name="Westbrook" /&gt; In 2001, the group followed up with their ''[[Celebrity (album)|Celebrity]]'' album,&lt;ref name="recordsales"&gt;{{cite web | author=Billboard |title='N Sync Artist Biography | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bio/index.jsp?pid=261075&amp;cr=artist&amp;or=ASCENDING&amp;sf=length&amp;kw=NSYNC|publisher=Billboard.com | accessdate=August 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which scored the second highest first-week album sales ever, trumped only by the group's previous album.&lt;ref name="Celebrity Sales Record"&gt;{{cite web|date=September 28, 2007 |url=http://50.lycos.com/080201.html |title=The Lycos Daily Report |publisher=Lycos |accessdate=July 26, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528133405/http://50.lycos.com/080201.html |archivedate=May 28, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NSYNC went on to sell over 56 million records worldwide.&lt;ref name="Record Sales"&gt;{{cite web|author=Gutierrez, Pedro Ruz. |date=January 28, 2007 |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orange/orl-mpearlman2807jan28,0,7354100.story?coll=orl-news-headlines-orange |title=Pearlman's Money Woes Follow Him Downtown |work=The Orlando Sentinel |accessdate=December 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012153735/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orange/orl-mpearlman2807jan28%2C0%2C7354100.story?coll=orl-news-headlines-orange |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the group announced that they would be taking a "hiatus", during which Timberlake began to record solo material.&lt;ref name="Hiatus Feelings"&gt;{{cite web |author=Westhoff, Ben |url=http://www.westword.com/2007-11-15/music/out-of-sync/ |title=Out of Sync |date=November 15, 2007| accessdate=December 7, 2007 |publisher=The Denver Westword}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'N Sync has not recorded new material since, and Bass has stated that he feels the group has officially disbanded.&lt;ref name="BrokenUp"&gt;{{cite web|author=Abbott, Jim |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/orl-bass2307oct23,0,2291743,print.story?coll=orl_mezz |title=Lance Bass Book Comes Out |accessdate=October 23, 2007 |work=The Orlando Sentinel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204015349/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/orl-bass2307oct23%2C0%2C2291743%2Cprint.story?coll=orl_mezz |archivedate=December 4, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Bass stated that he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 decision to pursue his solo career instead.&lt;ref name="Hiatus Feelings" /&gt; Bass has also said that he has little hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has "made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon."&lt;ref name="BrokenUp" /&gt; Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: "At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, I'm really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I don't hate him at all. And I understand what he was going through, and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us."&lt;ref name="FishelRelationship" /&gt;

====Free Lance Entertainment====
In 2000, Bass formed a [[music management]] company named Free Lance Entertainment, which was a joint venture with [[Mercury Nashville]], a division of [[Mercury Records]].&lt;ref name="FreeLance" /&gt; Vowing to keep the company "a strictly family-run operation," Bass employed his parents and sister as talent scouts, and recruited childhood friend and aspiring country singer [[Meredith Edwards (country music singer)|Meredith Edwards]] for the company's first release.&lt;ref name="Meredith Edwards"&gt;{{cite web |author=Zhito, Lisa | title=Lance Bass Protégé Meredith Edwards in Sync With Country |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1441732/20010315/edwards_meredith.jhtml | date=March 16, 2001 |accessdate=November 11, 2007| publisher=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards began touring with NSYNC as an opening act in the fall of 2000,&lt;ref name="Meredith Edwards" /&gt; and Bass teamed up with MTV to hold a nationwide talent search for more artists later that year.&lt;ref name="Timbaland"&gt;{{cite web |author=Hiatt, Brian. |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/17324001/artist_to_watch_onerepublic| date=May 27, 2000|title=Artist to Watch: OneRepublic |accessdate=November 22, 2007 |work=Rolling Stone|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127070418/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/17324001/artist_to_watch_onerepublic |archivedate = November 27, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Free Lance soon folded after disappointing sales of Edwards's debut album, ''[[Reach (Meredith Edwards album)|Reach]]''.&lt;ref name="Timbaland" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Defunct"&gt;{{cite web|author=Smith, Mary |title=Lance Bass Biography |publisher=ARS Compendium |url=http://www.arscompendium.com/2006/08/04/lance-bass-biography/ |accessdate=October 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting===

====Film, television and theater====
Bass guest-starred on the [[The WB Television Network|WB]] drama series ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', playing Rick Palmer, a love interest for [[Beverley Mitchell]]'s character, Lucy.&lt;ref name="7th Heaven"&gt;{{cite news|author=Bonin, Liane|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,98252,00.html |title='N Sync's Lance Bass Becomes a Movie Mogul|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=February 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, while NSYNC was in the midst of recording ''Celebrity'', Bass received his first starring role in the 2001 motion picture ''[[On the Line (2001 film)|On The Line]]''.&lt;ref name="On The Line"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Greg Dean Schmitz|Schmitz, Greg Dean]]. |date =July 27, 2001|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/preview/1808405275 |title=On The Line (2001) – Greg's Preview|publisher=Yahoo!

The film was produced by Bass's production company, A Happy Place (later renamed Bacon &amp; Eggs), and featured appearances by [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Al Green]], [[Bon Jovi]] guitarist [[Richie Sambora]], former [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] wrestler [[Chyna]], and Bass's bandmates Timberlake, Kirkpatrick and Fatone, the latter in a major role.&lt;ref name="On The Line" /&gt; The film also featured a soundtrack which included previously unreleased songs by NSYNC and [[Britney Spears]]. Bass collaborated with [[Joey Fatone]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[Christian Burns]] and [[True Vibe]] (as the "On The Line Allstars") for the film's theme song, "On The Line".&lt;ref name="OTL Collab"&gt;{{cite web |title=On The Line Allstars – "On The Line": Song Review |publisher=KidzWorld.com |url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/1433-the-on-the-line-all-stars-on-the-line-song-review |accessdate=December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite heavy marketing towards NSYNC teen fans, the film was a commercial failure, grossing only $4.2&amp;nbsp;million US domestically despite its $10&amp;nbsp;million US budget.&lt;ref name="OTLBudget"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1110294-on_the_line |title=On The Line Box Office &amp; Reviews |publisher=RottenTomatoes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, along with Bass's acting, was also poorly received by critics.&lt;ref name="OTLBudget" /&gt; Bass later said that he felt the film's success was greatly hindered by its release date, which came one week after the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] attacks of September 11, 2001.

The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving "overwhelming support" from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync.&lt;ref name="Reactions"&gt;{{cite web|author=Orzeck, Kurt |date=July 6, 2007|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1537282/07272006/n_sync.jhtml?headlines=true|title=Fans Overwhelmingly Support Lance Bass|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=July 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bass received criticism from the [[LGBT]] community when he referred to himself and his friends as "[[straight-acting]]" in his ''People'' interview, stating, "I call them the SAGs&amp;nbsp;– the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer."&lt;ref name="Professions"&gt;{{cite web|author=Vineyard, Jennifer|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1537155/20060726/n_sync.jhtml| title='N Sync's Lance Bass Reveals He's Gay | date=July 26, 2006| publisher=MTV News |accessdate=January 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that [[effeminacy|effeminate]] gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref name="Reactions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/print_article_ektid36685.asp |title=The Myth of "Straight Acting" |accessdate=July 13, 2007 |author=Rice, Christopher. |date=September 25, 2006 |work=The Advocate |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153701/http://www.advocate.com/print_article_ektid36685.asp |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 interview with ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', Bass called his comment a "mistake" and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term.&lt;ref name="Advocate Interview" /&gt; Bass stated, "Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] movement we have left here in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed."&lt;ref name="Advocate Interview" /&gt;

Bass found himself in the midst of further controversy later that year when he, along with then-boyfriend Reichen Lehmkuhl, was awarded the 2006 [[Human Rights Campaign]] Visibility Award on October 7, 2006.&lt;ref name="Southern Voice" /&gt; The ''[[Washington Blade]]'' printed a guest editorial from a long-time HRC supporter who claimed that neither recipient had done enough to deserve the award and that The Human Rights Campaign was simply capitalizing on Bass's fame to sell tickets.&lt;ref name="Award 2"&gt;{{cite web|title = Bye!

===Relationship and marriage===
Bass began dating painter and actor Michael Turchin in January 2011 and they became engaged in September 2013. They married on December 20, 2014 at the [[Park Plaza Hotel (Los Angeles)|Park Plaza Hotel]] in Los Angeles. Former NSYNC bandmates [[Joey Fatone]], [[Chris Kirkpatrick]] and [[JC Chasez]] were in attendance; [[Justin Timberlake]], who was then headlining his [[The 20/20 Experience World Tour]], was not present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lance-bass-is-married-get-759787?source=gravity |title=LANCE BASS IS MARRIED: GET THE DETAILS |first=Joceyln |last=Vena |website =[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=December 21, 2014 |access-date=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonial event was filmed and televised in a special [[E!]] presentation: ''Lance Loves Michael: The Lance Bass Wedding'' that aired on February 5, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprotoeu.mtiny.com/article.ftl?id=608304&amp;cc=ND |title=Lance Bass and Michael Turchin Are Officially Married--Find Out Which 'N Sync Member Performed at the Wedding |author=Carrie Dillivio |website=[[E!

===Spaceflight plans===
[[File:Bassnasa.jpg|upright|thumb|Bass's official cosmonaut photo, September 2002]]
In February 2002, Lena Banks, a space advocate and founder/producer of Think Tank Ink Productions, contacted Lance Bass to propose his involvement in her Youngest Person in Space project. Banks brought her longtime associate David Krieff of Destiny Productions on board and through a series of events in August 2002, Bass entered [[astronaut|cosmonaut]] training in [[Star City, Russia]].&lt;ref name="Space Review"/&gt; Bass was considered as the US host of a space competition show to be entitled ''The Big Mission'', which had been successful in Denmark, in which several contestants would go through rigorous training in order to win a seat on a Russian [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] [[space capsule]]. However, the game show concept was reconsidered, as the producers of the show decided it would be a much better idea to shoot a documentary of a celebrity actually training and going into space, and airing it on a major network. Lena Banks came up with the idea of the Youngest Person in Space many years before [[Dennis Tito]] had his historical flight. Through a series of events in early 2002 the chance of using Bass was presented when a colleague mentioned her space project to a friend and the friend's daughter shouted out, "Lance Bass wants to go into space!" The girl, who was an NSYNC fan, learned of Bass' lifelong dream of space travel when she read it online via a MTV forum.&lt;ref name="Space Review" /&gt; Lena Banks spoke to Lance Bass's management who then went to him with the proposal.  "At first he thought we were joking," Lena Banks remarks. "I assured him it was for real; he accepted and we moved forward with the project."

In order to be admitted into training, Bass had to go through strenuous physicals that saved his life. It was discovered he had [[cardiac arrhythmia]], and he agreed to undergo heart surgery to correct it. Prior to this, in 1999, he collapsed after a concert because of his condition.&lt;ref name="Heart Surgery"&gt;{{cite web|date=May 17, 2002|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2002-05-17#celeb4  |title=Lance Bass Has Heart Surgery |publisher=WENN|accessdate=July 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several months of training, Bass received cosmonaut certification and went on to Houston's [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) to take part in astronaut training.  He was scheduled to fly into space on the [[Soyuz TMA-1]] mission that was to be launched on October 30, 2002. The capsule was scheduled to fly to the [[International Space Station]] and land in a desert in [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="Cosmonaut 2" /&gt;

Several months before Bass was scheduled to fly, the original deal to air the documentary about Bass fell through. Bass's camp turned to MTV, who initially agreed to sponsor the trip but then backed out over "payment, insurance, and indemnification issues."&lt;ref name="Space Review" /&gt; Shortly after, all of Bass's other sponsorships fell through, including one sponsor that pulled out because they worried about the image of their brand possibly being tarnished if Bass were to die on the mission.&lt;ref name="Space Review" /&gt; Bass was eventually rejected from the program, and was replaced on the flight by Russian cosmonauts [[Yury Lonchakov]], [[Sergei Zalyotin]] and Belgium's [[Frank De Winne]].&lt;ref name="Yuri" /&gt;

====Space advocacy====
In 2003, Bass began serving as [[World Space Week]]'s Youth Spokesman.&lt;ref name="Space Review" /&gt; Bass has stated that he believes young people becoming more interested in [[space exploration]] "will help the future of our planet".&lt;ref name="Space Chat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space-explorers.com/internal/events/viewlog.html?bass2005|title=Transcript of Space Explorers chat with Lance Bass, World Space Week 2005|publisher=Space-Explorers.com|accessdate=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2005, Bass spent World Space Week traveling to American high schools speaking with students about space exploration and encouraging them to explore careers in the fields of science and mathematics.&lt;ref name="NSS"/&gt; Bass is a member of the [[National Space Society]], a non-profit educational [[space advocacy]] organization founded by Dr. [[Wernher von Braun]].&lt;ref name="NSS" /&gt; Bass has served on the National Space Society's [[Board of governors]] since October 2004, alongside other space advocates such as actor [[Tom Hanks]] and author and [[futurist]] Sir [[Arthur C. Clarke]].&lt;ref name="NSS" /&gt; In a 2007 interview with ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, Bass stated that he "absolutely" still intends on going to space, and that he hopes to work on a space documentary.&lt;ref name="BassGQ" /&gt; Bass has also retained fluency in Russian, which he was required to learn during his training.&lt;ref name="Russian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Multilingual |date=December 8, 2007 |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12082007/gossip/pagesix/multilingual_119455.htm |author=Page Six staff. |publisher=Page Six |accessdate=December 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210070104/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12082007/gossip/pagesix/multilingual_119455.htm |archivedate=December 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autobiography===
{{Main|Out of Sync}}
Following public response surrounding his coming out, Bass announced that he was releasing an autobiography. The book, entitled ''Out of Sync'', was published on October 23, 2007.&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press. |date=March 7, 2007|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2007-03-07-lance-bass_N.htm |title=Lance Bass Writes "Out of Sync" Memoir|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-written by ''[[The New York Times]]'' best-selling biographer Marc Eliot, who also wrote the book's introduction, and was published by [[Simon Spotlight Entertainment]], a division of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref name="NYTimesBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon &amp; Schuster"&gt;{{cite web |author=Simon Spotlight Entertainment |url=http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=1&amp;pid=536749 |title=Simon &amp; Schuster: Out of Sync |accessdate=September 28, 2007 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 208-page book covers what Bass describes as "the first chapter" in his life, from his childhood growing up in rural Mississippi, to his efforts to obtain a seat on a Russian space capsule and the proceeding financial issues he had with his sponsors, and culminating with Bass's decision to go public with his [[sexuality]].&lt;ref name="Book" /&gt; The book includes details about boyfriends that he kept from family and friends, and recounts NSYNC's 2002 decision to go on an "extended hiatus". Bass stated that [[Justin Timberlake]] was the sole reason NSYNC did not get back together.&lt;ref name="NYTimesBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon &amp; Schuster" /&gt; ''Out of Sync'' debuted on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for the week of November 11, 2007.&lt;ref name="BestSeller" /&gt;

===Philanthropy and causes===
Bass has been involved with a number of charities during his career. In 2001, Bass founded The Lance Bass Foundation, a non-profit organization that was designed to meet the health needs of low-income children.&lt;ref name="Cosmonaut 1" /&gt; In 2003, Bass donated $30,000 US to establish the Amber Pulliam [[Special Education]] Endowment at The [[University of Southern Mississippi]].&lt;ref name="Amber Pulliam"&gt;{{cite web | author=Tisdale, David|title=Northeast Jones High Senior Makes Mark on Southern Miss | publisher = University of Southern Mississippi | url=http://www.usm.edu/pr/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=717 | accessdate=August 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The endowment is in honor of his younger cousin, Amber Pulliam, who has [[Down syndrome]], and was established to financially aid students from Mississippi's [[Pine Belt (Mississippi)|Pine Belt]] who plan a career in special education.&lt;ref name="Amber Pulliam" /&gt;

After 2005's [[Hurricane Katrina]], Bass launched "uBid For Hurricane Relief", a celebrity auction to benefit victims of the hurricane, with uBid.com.&lt;ref name="Katrina"&gt;{{cite web|title=uBid For Hurricane Relief Effort |url=http://www.ubid.com/about/Press_room/Press37.asp |date=2006-03-01 |publisher=uBid.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013092638/http://ubid.com/about/Press_room/Press37.asp |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from the auction were split between the [[Child Welfare League of America]], The [[Brett Favre]] Fourward Foundation, and [[Ashton Kutcher]]'s RockWorks Foundation.&lt;ref name="Katrina" /&gt; Many of Bass's family members in Mississippi were directly affected by the hurricane.&lt;ref name="Katrina Family"&gt;{{cite news|title = Media Pushes for Government Action on Hurricane Disaster|work=Showbiz Tonight|publisher = [[CNN.com]]| date = September 2, 2005|url =http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0509/02/sbt.01.html  |accessdate = November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Bass appeared on an episode of ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' with a donation to a [[Russians|Russian]] woman to save a camp for disabled children in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/extreme-makeover-home-edition/episode-guide/episode-307-teas-family |title=Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&amp;nbsp;– Season Three&amp;nbsp;– Teas Family |date=October 15, 2005 |accessdate=January 22, 2014 |publisher=ABC |quote=Lance Bass also makes a donation to a former camper to save a similar camp back in her native Russia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203194209/http://abc.go.com/shows/extreme-makeover-home-edition/episode-guide/episode-307-teas-family |archivedate=February 3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucy Barker''' is a fictional character that appears in some versions of the story ''[[Sweeney Todd]]''.

==Character overview==
In the original legend and in the earliest melodramas and plays, Sweeney Todd has no wife or backstory and is the primary villain of the stories he appears in. His wife Lucy first appears in [[Christopher Bond]]'s play. She is the faithful and loving wife of [[Sweeney Todd|Benjamin Barker]] and mother of [[Johanna Barker]], whose life is destroyed by the horrible [[Judge Turpin]], who exiles her husband in order to have her all to himself. Soon afterward, Turpin rapes her, so she then poisons herself with [[arsenic]]. She does survive, but goes insane and disappears to live as a poor beggar, surviving on alms. Mistakenly believing her to be dead, Barker undertakes a long string of murders, with the ultimate goal of killing Turpin in order to avenge the destruction of his family.

== In ''Sweeney Todd'' ==
Lucy Barker is the wife of Benjamin Barker, a barber in London's [[Fleet Street]]. They are happily married and have a new baby—Johanna Barker. Judge Turpin is immediately jealous of Benjamin because of  Lucy's beauty and has Barker falsely arrested and exiled so that he may obtain her all for himself. Lucy ignores his pursuit, staying faithful to her husband, never once leaving home. Finally, she is lured to Turpin's estate, led to believe that the judge feels responsible for her plight and wants to help her.

This is not the case, however: Lucy arrives at Turpin's masquerade ball, where he drugs and [[rape]]s her. Lucy is so distraught that she attempts to kill herself with poison, but survives and is driven completely insane. She forgets everyone and everything she held dear and wanders the streets of London as a [[Homelessness|homeless]] beggar.

When Benjamin Barker, under the alias of "[[Sweeney Todd (character)|Sweeney Todd]]", returns years later, [[Mrs. Lovett]], who was in love with him, leads him to believe that Lucy is dead. Lucy shows evident distaste for Mrs. Lovett, calling her a witch and constantly hanging around her meat pie shop. Eventually, when Johanna is upstairs at the barber shop, Lucy pursues her up the stairs, believing Turpin's minion Beadle Bamford to be in Todd's shop. Todd then shows up and Lucy begins to recognize him. He, however, does not recognize her, cuts her throat and drops her body down the chute. Downstairs, after Todd has killed Judge Turpin, Lovett recognizes Lucy's body and scrambles to get rid of her.

Todd enters and discovers that he had just killed his beloved wife, whereupon Lovett concedes that she lied to him because she was in love with him. Enraged, Todd throws Lovett in the oven to burn to death. Stricken with remorse, Todd holds Lucy's body and has his throat cut with his very own razor by [[Tobias Ragg]], leaving them dead in each other's arms (in the film version, Todd willingly allows Tobias to cut his throat in revenge).

Etheridge is known for her mixture of "confessional lyrics, pop-based folk-rock, and raspy, smoky vocals."&lt;ref name="All Music" /&gt; She has also been a gay and lesbian activist since her public coming out in January 1993.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of gay and lesbian pop culture"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VGrrAiSNAkC&amp;pg=PT108&amp;lpg=PT108&amp;dq=Etheridge+iconic+gay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YQT2fEkngL&amp;sig=UmA4jdBGHyC5OKTQVbdIFWBUGIk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Tk35S6rUG8H88AaS1-yzCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Etheridge%20iconic%20gay&amp;f=false|title=Melissa Etheridge |author=Luca Prono|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has received fifteen [[Grammy Award]] nominations throughout her career, winning two, in 1993 and 1995. In 2007, she won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for "[[I Need to Wake Up]]" from the film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''. In September 2011, Etheridge received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467228/melissa-etheridge-lands-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star |title=Melissa Etheridge Lands Hollywood Walk of Fame Star|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==

Etheridge was born in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], the younger of two girls of Elizabeth (Williamson), a computer consultant, and John Etheridge, an [[American Constitution]] teacher at [[Leavenworth High School]]. Her father was a high school psychology teacher, counselor and [[athletic director]] at her alma mater, Leavenworth High School. He died in August 1991. Her mother was a homemaker and a computer analyst and is now retired.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Etheridge attended David Brewer School, which is still located at 17th and Osage Streets. She graduated in 1979 from Leavenworth High School (LHS) at 10th Avenue and Halderman. She was a member of the first "Power and Life" musical/dance group at LHS. Her childhood home was at 1902 Miami Street.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Etheridge's interest in music began early; she picked up her first guitar at 8. She began to play in all-men country music groups throughout her teenage years, until she moved to Boston to attend [[Berklee College of Music]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

While at Berklee, Etheridge played the club circuit around Boston. After three semesters, Etheridge decided to drop out of Berklee and head to Los Angeles to attempt a career in music.&lt;ref name="All Music" /&gt;  Etheridge was discovered in a bar called Vermie's in Pasadena, CA. She had made some friends on a women's soccer team and those new friends came to see her play. One of the women was Karla Leopold, whose husband, Bill Leopold, was a manager in the music business. Karla convinced Bill to see her perform live. He was impressed, and has remained a pivotal part of Etheridge's career ever since.&lt;ref name=autobiography&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5_4DEtjV0vcC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=carla+leopold+%2B+etheridge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-3LTGfzTdq&amp;sig=xUszXiYspkFatC9h8fylYUxGeFs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ijgQTLLSMIq4NrS8kf8C&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Truth Is ...: My Life in Love and Music|last1=Etheridge|first1=Melissa|last2=Morton |first2=Laura|year=2002|edition=2nd|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=72|isbn=978-0-307-76564-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This, in addition to her gigs in lesbian bars around Los Angeles, led to her discovery by [[Island Records]] chief Chris Blackwell. She received a publishing deal to write songs for movies including the 1986 movie [[Weeds (1987 film)|Weeds]].&lt;ref name="CMT.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/melissa-etheridge|title=Melissa Etheridge|author=cmt.com|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, prior to her signing, Etheridge sent her demo to [[Olivia Records]], a lesbian record label, but was ultimately rejected. She saved the rejection letter, signed by "the women of Olivia", which was later featured in ''[[Intimate Portrait (TV series)|Intimate Portrait: Melissa Etheridge]]'', the [[Lifetime Television]] documentary of her life.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Career==
===1988–1992: Road to rock stardom===
After an unreleased first effort that was rejected by Island Records as being too polished and glossy, she completed her stripped-down self-titled debut in just four days. Her eponymous debut album ''[[Melissa Etheridge (album)|Melissa Etheridge]]'', released in 1988, was an underground hit, and the single, "[[Bring Me Some Water]]", a hit on radio, was nominated for a Grammy.&lt;ref name="CMT.com" /&gt;

At the time of the album's release, it was not generally known that Etheridge was a lesbian. While on the road promoting the album, she paused in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], to be interviewed for the syndicated radio program ''Pulsebeat—Voice of the Heartland'', explaining the intensity of her music by saying: "People think I'm really sad—or really angry. But my songs are written about the conflicts I have...I have no anger toward anyone else."&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, James L. (2005) "Go, Girl, Go! The Women's Revolution in Music," Schirmer Trade Books, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; She invited the radio syndication producer to attend her concert that night. He did and was surprised to find himself one of the few men in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, James L. (2005) "Go, Girl, Go! The Women's Revolution in Music," Schirmer Trade Books, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Etheridge followed up her first album's success by contributing background vocals to [[Don Henley]]'s album ''[[The End of the Innocence (album)|The End of the Innocence]]''. She went into the studio and recorded her second album ''[[Brave and Crazy]]'' which was released in 1989.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

''Brave and Crazy'' followed the same musical formula as her eponymous debut garnering a Grammy nomination. The album peaked at #22 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] (equal to her first album). Etheridge then went on the road, like one of her musical influences, [[Bruce Springsteen]], and built a loyal fan base.&lt;ref name="Biography.com" /&gt; Etheridge has covered his songs "[[Thunder Road (song)|Thunder Road]]" and "[[Born to Run (song)|Born to Run]]" during live shows.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In 1992, Etheridge released her third album, ''[[Never Enough (Melissa Etheridge album)|Never Enough]]''. Similar to her prior two albums, ''Never Enough'' didn't reach the top of the charts peaking at #21 but gave Etheridge her first Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] for her single "Ain't It Heavy". ''Never Enough'' was considered a more personal and mature album from Etheridge at that time. With rumors circulating around her sexuality (Etheridge was not out yet at this point), the album seemed to inadvertently address these rumors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r6883|pure_url=yes}}|title=Never Enough – Melissa Etheridge|publisher=AllMusic|date=March 17, 1992|accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Etheridge established a performing arts scholarship at Leavenworth High School in honor of her father. She said her father used to "spend his weekends driving me to Kansas City and all points around there so I could play in bands.

The success of ''Yes I Am'' helped increase sales of Etheridge's earlier albums.

Etheridge's follow-up to ''Yes I Am'' was the moderately successful ''[[Your Little Secret]]''. The album was not as well received by critics as Etheridge's prior recordings. Featuring a lead single of the same name, "[[Your Little Secret]]" is the highest charting album of Etheridge's career, having reached #6 on the ''Billboard'' album charts; however, the album spent only 41 weeks on the chart.

The year 2001 saw the release of ''[[Skin (Melissa Etheridge album)|Skin]]'', an album she described as "the closest I've ever come to recording a concept album. It has a beginning, middle and end.

Despite positive reviews, ''Skin'' sold less than 500,000 copies. On the Billboard charts, it peaked at #9 but dropped out of the Top 200 after just 12 weeks. The single "[[I Want to Be in Love]]" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female]] (losing to [[Lucinda Williams]]). The video clip of this song starred [[Jennifer Aniston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHBN_4PRYBo|title=Melissa Etheridge – I Want To Be In Love|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=October 8, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etheridge told the ''[[Washington Blade]]'' in an interview that "my belief is that cancer comes from inside you and so much of it has to do with the environment of your body...It's the stress that will turn that gene on or not...I really encourage people to go a lot longer and further before coming to that conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lou Chibbaro|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/06/13/rippin-tearin-strippin/|title=Melissa Etheridge on Wolf Trap and drastic health steps &amp;#124; Washington|work=[[Washington Blade]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Andrea Geduld, the director of the Breast Health Resource Center at Mt. Sinai Hospital, she told KMBZ.com that Etheridge's comments were out of line and that she finds Etheridge's criticism of Jolie puzzling, given that Jolie's choice to have a double mastectomy couldn't have been an easy one, "we wouldn't criticize someone for wearing a seatbelt to reduce the risk of dying in an accident, so I'm not sure why we would criticize someone for having a mastectomy when we know it cuts their risk of getting cancer."  Experts also caution that some of Etheridge's statements are not accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmbz.com/Experts-Melissa-Etheridge-s-Comments-on-Angelina-J/16627766|title=Experts: Melissa Etheridge's Comments On Angelina Jolie Out Of Line|website=KMBZ.com|date=|accessdate=October 26, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010840/http://www.kmbz.com/Experts-Melissa-Etheridge-s-Comments-on-Angelina-J/16627766|archivedate=March 5, 2016|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 interview with [[CNN]] after the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' and ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'', Etheridge stated that she planned to marry her partner [[Linda Wallem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/26/entertainment-us-usa-courts-gaymarriage-idUSBRE95P16B20130626 |title=Singer Melissa Etheridge to wed after gay marriage ruling|agency=Reuters|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple married on May 31, 2014 in [[San Ysidro Ranch]] in Montecito, California, two days after they both turned 53.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/melissa-etheridge-linda-wallem-marry-california|title=Melissa Etheridge Weds Linda Wallem|publisher=''People''|author=K.C. Baker|date=May 31, 2014|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etheridge was featured on a 2015 episode of ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (U.S. TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6545653/melissa-etheridge-who-do-you-think-you-are-exclusive-clip|title=Exclusive: Watch Melissa Etheridge Discover Her Heritage on 'Who Do You Think You Are?'|publisher=''Billboard''|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2014, Etheridge partnered with a California medical marijuana dispensary to make cannabis-infused wine. Etheridge and Greenway Compassionate Relief in Santa Cruz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cannabis-infused-wine-delivers-a-full-body-buzz-says-melissa-etheridge/|author=Parvati Shallow|title=Cannabis-infused Wine Delivers a "Full Body Buzz" Says Melissa Etheridge|publisher=CBSNews|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; started small, making a few barrels of reds infused with CBD{{spnd}}THC's medical non-high inducing counterpart{{spnd}}that sold quickly. "The vineyards were afraid the white wines would turn green and that no one would want to drink a green wine," Etheridge said. Etheridge has since expanded her selection of No Label wine tinctures to include a Shiraz, a Grenache and eventually a Cabernet.

A 2016 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that she was currently wearing [[hearing aids]].&lt;ref name="TimesMothDaugh"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/fashion/melissa-etheridge-brad-pitt-debate-night.html|title=A Mother-Daughter Night With Melissa Etheridge|author=Katherine Rosman|date=October 7, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2017|quote=How does a rock star begin an evening?

''In this [[Japanese name]], the family name is Hanada.''

'''Hanada Miki''' (花田　ミキ,&lt;ref name="松岡p8" /&gt; 9 September 1914&amp;nbsp;– 1 August 2006) is a Japanese researcher of health nursing and health advisor.

She devoted herself to saving lives and health of people in Aomori Prefecture after the [[WWII]], making efforts in building the educational institute for nurses, resolving towns and villages without health nurses from the standpoint of health administration, and establishing the system of rescue and nursing in remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=March 1976|title=通常総会特別講演 農村の人達の健康を守るために|url=http://www.kouseiren-ta.or.jp/pagedata/n-tnouson/kaisi/kaisi_7/070101.pdf|format=PDF|journal=富山県農村医学研究会誌|publisher=富山県農村医学研究会|volume=7|page=10|id={{NCID|AN00175384}}|quote=和書|accessdate=2015-10-31 &lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://megalodon.jp/2015-1026-1237-49/www.kouseiren-ta.or.jp/pagedata/n-tnouson/kaisi/kaisi_7/070101.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-26 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her attitude has been handed down to a number of people who engage in nursing in Aomori even in Heisei period. Having worked as a military nurse during the war, she is known as a person who kept on telling her experiences during the war through self-published books　because of an unwavering belief that "everything that stands against life is evil".&lt;ref name="松岡p8" /&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Before and during WWII ===
After graduating from Aomori Hirosaki Girls' High School (later Aomori Prefectural Hirosaki Chuo High School), she had to give up the further study because of the financial difficulty of her family and decided to be independent as a nurse.&lt;ref name="佐藤"&gt;{{Harvnb|佐藤|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="永沢p30"&gt;{{Harvnb|永沢ほか|1989|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining her career in [[Japanese Red Cross Society]] (JRCS) and Morioka Nursing School, she started to work for Aomori Branch of JRCS in 1934. She was called up as a [[military nurse]] after the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1937, thus she spent almost all her youth in the battlefields.&lt;ref name="松岡p214"&gt;{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|pp=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, she suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and [[typhoid fever]] on the [[hospital ship]]s then went into the Hiroshima Military Hospital (later Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital &amp; Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital). Although she had not chosen to be a nurse due to humanitarianism, she was impressed with devoted nursing by a nurse while hospitalized there, which greatly changed her thought of health nursing.{{Sfn|松岡|2010|pp=24–25}}&lt;ref name="永沢p155"&gt;{{Harvnb|永沢ほか|1989|pp=155–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She returned to the military after recovering from the typhoid fever. Gradually she agonized herself with the death of many soldiers and the reality that soldiers who recovered from wounds in the hospital go to their death again, she harbored her resentment against war itself{{Sfn|松岡|2010|pp=12–34}} finally concluding that "everything that stands against life is evil". At least by way of resisting the war, she continued to send the wills of soldiers dying in bed to their families without being noticed by the inspectors.&lt;ref name="寺沢"&gt;{{Harvnb|寺沢|1989|pp=153–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, 1943, she returned home because her tuberculosis was not cured. After studying hard, she got the certifications of a teacher of nursing and of a health nurse.&lt;ref name="永沢p155" /&gt; She became the head nurse of the nursing school in Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital which opened in the same year in Hachinohe and started to live in the residential hall together with her students.&lt;ref name="松岡p214" /&gt;

=== Reform of nursing ===
In 1947, when the Association of Japanese Midwives, Nurses and Health Nurses (later [[Japanese Nursing Association]]) was established as one of the reforms of nursing by [[United States Army Air Corps|GHQ]], she undertook the foundation of its branch in Aomori.

It started with only 6 students.|quoted from Kaneko{{Harvnb|金子|1992|p=268}}}}In&amp;nbsp;1949, the outbreak of [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] occurred in Hachinohe. The vaccine had not been developed in those days, and newspapers reported that phenomenon was a rare case in the world. Hanada, receiving the request from the doctor who was in charge of it, went to Tokyo for studying the treatment. She got the information materials of Kenny Method which was effective in Australia from GHQ with the help for JRCS. Curing people in Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital every day, she introduced the method to the public through newspaper articles.&amp;nbsp;

In the reform of nursing at the postwar time, Hanada continued to studying American style nursing to find that education of nurses in Japan is far behind America. In order to have the society recognize nurses as a profession, she tried to establish an educational institute of nursing, following the [[Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery]] in London. Her desire was achieved by opening the Aomori-ken Koto Kango Gakuin (later&amp;nbsp;Aomori University of Health and Welfare). However, there was only one applicant at first, which proved that&amp;nbsp;Hanada's thought had hardly been accepted to the public yet. A newspaper article titled "Hated Prefectural College of Nursing" denounced her building an unnecessary, nonurgent school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=嫌われた県立看護学院 応募者がたった一人 ナイチンゲールは昔の夢?|date=28 October 1951|publisher=東奥日報社|page=2|newspaper=[[東奥日報]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="金子p268"&gt;{{Harvnb|金子|1992|pp=268–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; She visited high schools around Aomori in order to attract students by introducing Florence Nightingale with her handmade picture-story shows and to explain the importance of nursing education.&lt;ref name="金子p268" /&gt; Thanks to her efforts, the school had 38 applicants&lt;ref name="松岡p92" /&gt; the following year. Hanada also worked there as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[[花田ミキ#CITEREF.E6.9D.BE.E5.B2.A12010|松岡 2010]], p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Actions in the Prefectural Government ===
Accompanying the establishment of this prefectural institute, the Nursing Unite of Medical Department was founded in&amp;nbsp;Aomori Prefectural Government. Hanada was asked to be the unit chief because she was the very person who proposed to establish the educational institute. In 1950, a year before the College of Nursing opened, she quit the Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital and started to work in the Government. This post was the top hierarchy in the educational system of nursing in Aomori.&lt;ref name="木村p256"&gt;{{Harvnb|木村|2012|pp=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that a woman from outside of the Prefectural Government&amp;nbsp;got the position of a unit chief for the first time attracted tremendous interest amongst mass media at that time, not only because women in those days rarely had a position title but also because even male officers with more than 10 years' experiences had difficulty in getting the position like hers.&lt;ref&gt;松岡 2010, pp. 92–97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="松岡p92"&gt;{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|pp=92–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Hanada visited Iwate Prefecture to study the health action by Iwate National Health Insurance Organization regarding Society-Managed Health Insurance&amp;nbsp;had been active for a long time outstandingly in Tohoku Area. After returning, she cooperated with the same organization in Aomori to contribute to spreading their actions. While working on it, she discussed the health problems with the residents to realize the need to send health nurses around Aomori, following the examples like Kochi where the problems had successfully been resolved.&lt;ref name="木村p266"&gt;{{Harvnb|木村|2012|pp=250–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, in order to resolve the [[infant mortality]] rate of Aomori that was the highest in Japan those days, Hanada started a campaign called "Mottara Korosuna Undo (the Never Kill If You Get Pregnant Campaign)" together with health nurses and midwives. She gave mothers bleached cotton to support their wombs if they notify their pregnancy to the Prefectural Government early for the purpose of raising awareness of not having fetuses die. This community-based campaign enabled health nurses to build relationships while visiting households steadily and honestly.&lt;ref name="松岡p120" /&gt;

In those days, approximately half of all the towns or villages in Aomori, especially remote areas, had no health nurse because of difficult financial situations of such communities and lack of health nurses who hoped to work there. In order to resolve this problem, Haken Hoken-fu Seido (The Temporary Health Nurse System) devised by Hanada began in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;木村 2012, pp. 234&lt;/ref&gt; This system allowed graduates from Prefectural College of Nursing to be employed as officials of Aomori Prefecture and sent to each town or village with traveling expenses paid by the government.&lt;ref name="松岡p120"&gt;{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|pp=120–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system increased the number of health nurses who accepted to work for remote areas as their period of toleration for some years before going back to cities. Moreover, some of them married and settled in their places of appointment to keep working there.&lt;ref name="松岡p120" /&gt; Although 29 towns and villages had no health nurse in 1962, the establishment of the system of sending at least 2 of them in these areas in 1971 allowed all areas in Aomori Prefecture to have health nurses.&lt;ref&gt;金子 1992, pp. 273&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the maintenance of this system of health nursing was impossible without the leadership of both Hanada and Takeuchi Shunkichi,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;木村 2012, pp. 256–265.&lt;/ref&gt; who was the local governor in those days and had similar experiences to Hanada as a war correspondent.&lt;ref name="松岡p120" /&gt;

Hanada retired the Aomori Prefectural Government in 1973. Her position as the Health Nursing Supervisor at retirement was the highest of all female governors those days.&lt;ref name="松岡p120" /&gt; She won the Public Health Award held by Dai-ichi Life Group in the same year, and To-o Award by To-o Daily Press in the following year.&lt;ref name="松岡p120" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.47news.jp/CI/200707/CI-20070722-8583726.html|title=故花田ミキさん偲び「語る会」|date=22 July 2007|publisher=www.pnjp.jp/ 全国新聞ネット|newspaper=[[47NEWS]]|accessdate=2015-12-27|archiveurl=http://megalodon.jp/2015-1026-1232-41/www.47news.jp/CI/200707/CI-20070722-8583726.html|archivedate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Actions as a Health Nursing Researcher ===
After retiring the local government, Hanada worked as a freelance researcher of health nursing. In 1950, she got the position of the head of Aogiri-kai in Japan Red Cross in Aomori (hereafter Aogiri-kai),&lt;ref name="佐藤" /&gt; a mutual support organization composed of unmarried women who studied nursing in JRCS, where she made her active base.&lt;ref name="松岡p120" /&gt; She actively accepted many requests of lectures and interviews.&lt;ref name="松岡p166"&gt;{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|pp=166–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to counter the threat from aging society, Hanada started Kango Ginko (Nursing Bank) organized by Aogiri-kai in 1980. The system was to have elderly people help work each other through the special tickets instead of money, where Hanada announced herself as the president. Although it was a pioneering system, it did not take its root in the society.&lt;ref name="松岡p157"&gt;{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|pp=157–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, Aogiri-kai, the Association of Social Workers in Health Services of Aomori, and the Federation of Regional Women's Organization in Aomori cooperated starting telephone counseling services for senior citizens called "Koreisha 110 ban (number 110 for senior citizens)". This system developed later, resulting in organizing "Volunteer Ajisai", where the three organizations and the branch office of Japanese Nursing Association collaborate with each other. Hanada also worked as its caretaker.

In 1994, Hanada was nominated for [[Florence Nightingale Medal]]. Even though this is the most prestigious award in the world as a nurse, she rejected to receive it. She told the reason in the bulletin of Aogiri-kai titled ''Aogiri-kai Dayori'' as a previous military nurse and a person who experienced the WWII as below;&lt;ref name="松岡p120" /&gt;{{Quote frame|Then I got to have a belief; I have to tell and hand down the foolishness of wars throughout my life. I have to live together with the spirits of many people who were killed in the war. As a person in the generation involved in the war, I will not forget the feeling of atonement. If I should have a chance to receive any award as a person who participated in the war, I will reject it.|Quoted from Matsuoka{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|pp=138–139}}}}Within the same year, she self-published the collection of her war stories as a military nurse, ''Kataritsugitai'' (I Want To Hand This Down). Also in 1997, she published the Tanka collection titled ''Oki Nao Kiezu'' (Fire Has Not Yet Disappeared),&amp;nbsp;hoping to tell many people her experiences of the war. It was hard to transmit experiences of the war as memories of it was gradually fading after half a century of the postwar period. Despite that, she continued to self-publishing her war stories and sent them to her friends.&lt;ref name="佐藤" /&gt;&lt;ref name="松岡p166" /&gt;

=== Late life ===
In 1998, Hanada resigned the head of Aogiri-kai on account of old age. She stayed away from people who were in close relationships before, only keeping in touch with them by exchanging letters. It is said this was because she did not like to show old and weak herself to people.&lt;ref&gt;松岡 2010, pp. 186–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Hanada died for the liver cancer at the age of 91. She was unmarried throughout her life because she lost the chance because of the war. Based on her will, her body was given to the Faculty of Medicine in Hirosaki University and the funeral was not held. Her last words as a pacifist, which was sent to her younger brother, was published in her obituary in To-o Daily Press and impressed the readers.&lt;ref name="松岡p8"&gt;{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;松岡 2010, pp.204–213.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote frame|I believe the spirits of 3150 thousand people who were killed in that war transformed into the Constitution of Japan. As the shield of not fighting and not being involved in wars in the future, I deeply pray this article 9 in the peace Constitution will be protected.|Matsuoka&amp;nbsp;{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|pp=8–9}}}}

== Evaluation ==
Hanada and Satoe Kamimura, who led health nursing in Kochi Prefecture in Showa era, were called "Miki Hanada in Aomori for the East, Satoe Kamimura in Kochi for the West".&lt;ref name="松岡p120" /&gt; They were also called "Emperor Kamimura for the West, Emperor Hanada for the East"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by people who engaged in nursing in those days because of their leadership and humanity. Compared with Kamimura, Hanada is remarkable in that she seriously regarded the action by local residents and labor movement by health nurses. This is because of their different career experiences; when Kamimura started to work as a health nurse, the purpose of the work had already been unified for cooperation in the all-out war, while Hanada had been an expert in nursing activities before the unique health nursing system in Aomori Prefecture started.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;木村 2012, pp.266–268&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, since she regarded the residents and labors seriously, she often clashed not only with the administration when working for the hospital but also with the top management and the government when working for Aomori Prefectural Government. When she tried to improve the working condition of nurses in the hospital, the doctors taunted her to be so Americanized.&lt;ref&gt;松岡 2010, pp. 70–89.&lt;/ref&gt; When the innovative councilors criticized the way of governing health nursing in Aomori prefectural assembly, the false rumor that Hanada stirred them to do it flew.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hanada herself was severely told off by her boss even though she knew nothing.&lt;ref name="金子p272"&gt;{{Harvnb|金子|1992|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also clashed with her boss when tackling on the health nursing in remote areas, which made her write resignation letters several times.&lt;ref name="金子p272" /&gt; It is said that she endured these hardships remembering the encouragement across the border by Grace Elizabeth Alt in GHQ.

The previous nurses in Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital describe Hanada as a person who always thought of nurses as their head in the prewar era when the social position of women was low and working women were received prejudice; {{Quote frame|The head nurse Hanada was the one who regarded seriously the improvement of nurses' position and the model of nurses in the society. She claimed that we must improve ourselves as working women and that we should honor ourselves as professional nurses. [...] I heard there was much disagreement between her and the director of the hospital and chief secretary. But there is no reform without clashes. Hanada was the one who carried it out.|Matsuoka&amp;nbsp;{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|p=80}}}}{{Quote frame|The head nurse Hanada was said to be a leftist because she tried to reform nursing. She, a human who was called the head nurse Hanada, was the representative of us nurses.|Matsuoka{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|p=80}}}}One of Hanada's students in Aomori-ken Koto Kango Gakuin, who later worked as a professor in Aomori University of Health and Welfare, Faculty of Health Science, Department of Nursing, told the feature of her lectures like below;{{Quote frame|Miss. Hanada lectured really impressively. She told about health and lives of local people as well as about protecting daily life based on her own experiences. This made her lectures really vigorous. She frequently told us about the war. [...] What she told us was quite real [...].|Matsuoka{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|p=194}}}}The Chief of public health department of Aomori Prefectural Government in those days called her "giant", evaluating her activities there like below;{{Quote frame|There is something different in her point of view from other officers. Before working in the Prefectural Government, she belonged to the military and Hachinohe Red Cross Hospital, where she took care of seriously ill people and went through many dreadful scenes. Because of these, she had the developed eyes to see the reality. [...] She was very assertive in both planning and negotiation. She should be suitable for an administrative officer.|Matsuoka{{Harvnb|松岡|2010|p=135}}}}"Mottara Korosuna Undo" promoted by her in Aomori Prefectural Government was worth Nobel Prize in that the campaign remarkably contributed to the reduction of infant death rates by improving the local nursing services.&lt;ref&gt;金子 1992, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were contrary opinions that the word "Korosuna (Never kill)" was too direct and shocking for a slogan. Additionally, some criticized distributing bleached cotton as bribing women with stuff they want, others insisted that Aomori Prefecture was regarded as the representative of backward prefecture because the bleached cotton was thought to be out of date.&lt;ref name="松岡p120" /&gt;

The system to send health nurses formulated by Hanada in the following year called "Aomori Method" was paid a special attention to and highly evaluated all over Japan.&lt;ref name="松岡p120" /&gt; After this system was established, no town or village suffered from the tough situation without health medical services. Despite that, the system was hard to be accepted by the personnel department and the general affairs department in the prefectural government because it had to employ health nurses, who each town and village normally should have employed by themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="松岡p120" /&gt;

The "Nurse Bank", which she formulated as the resolution of aging society after retiring the prefectural government, was paid much attention to by mass media since the system was pioneering. However, the reason for its unsuccess is indicated as following; that it was not the right time; that the leader had already retired the official; and that she lacked people who could always assist her.&lt;ref name="松岡p157" /&gt; Despite that, both the Association of Social Workers in Health Services of Aomori and the Federation of Regional Women's Organization in Aomori were interested in the "Nurse Bank" as a supportive system for aged people, joining "Koreisha 110 ban" which had the same purpose.&lt;ref name="佐藤" /&gt;

"Koreisha 110 ban" was reputed to make multiplier effects on account of cooperation of three different types of associations and organizations. Some customers those says made full use of the counseling service, talking for 40 minutes. It was rare in those days for several different parties to cooperate with each other but Hanada bridged them with her caring personality,&lt;ref name="松岡p166" /&gt; according to the vice president of the Association of Social workers in Health Services of Aomori at the time.&amp;nbsp;The Social Welfare Council in Aomori has the similar service "Fukushi Anshin Denwa (Welfare and Security Hot Line)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aosyakyo.or.jp/citizens/%E7%A6%8F%E7%A5%89%E5%AE%89%E5%BF%83%E9%9B%BB%E8%A9%B1%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%93%E3%82%B9%E4%BA%8B%E6%A5%AD/|title=福祉安心電話サービス事業|publisher=aosyakyo.or.jp/ 青森社会福祉協議会 &lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://megalodon.jp/2015-1025-0740-28/aosyakyo.or.jp/citizens/%E7%A6%8F%E7%A5%89%E5%AE%89%E5%BF%83%E9%9B%BB%E8%A9%B1%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%93%E3%82%B9%E4%BA%8B%E6%A5%AD/ |archivedate=2015-10-25 --&gt;|accessdate=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;", whose predecessor is "Koreisha 110 ban" run by Hanada.&lt;ref name="松岡p166" /&gt;

'''Operation Binatang'''  was an Australian [[covert operation]] conducted by the [[Services Reconnaissance Department]] (SRD) during  [[World War Two]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BINATANG, copy I|url=https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=235155|via=National Archives of Australia|date=1944-1945|accessdate=25 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525052732/https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=235155|archivedate=25 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An agent of [[Z Special Unit]] was to be landed on the north coast of Java to recruit more men who would give active assistance to the allied cause.
The operation was conceived in January 1944 but owing to the shortage of available submarines and the priority of [[Operation_Hornbill_(World_War_Two)|Operation Hornbill]] it was delayed.  When Hornbill was aborted arrangements were made for the mission to commence in February 1945.

The agent chosen was Q272298 Private John Charles Buxton of “Z” Special Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=4637074|title=BUXTON JOHN CHARLES : Service Number - Q272298|date=1939-1948|accessdate=25 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525052726/https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=4637074|archivedate=25 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buxton was born in [[Semarang]] to an English father and Javanese mother and escaped to Australia from Japanese occupied Java in 1943 aboard a lugger.  As he was familiar with the area,  Buxton would probably have more success than [[Operation_Tiger_(Java)|Operation Tiger]], which was a series of operations  conducted by the [[Netherlands East Indies Forces Intelligence Service]] (NEIFIS), almost all ended in disaster.[[File:HMS Telemachus.jpg|thumb|HMS Telemachus|right]]
The insertion into Japanese occupied Java was to be carried out on 24 February 1945 along the coast near Ujung Piring (Cape Piring) not far from the town of [[Jepara]] and approximately 80km north east of Semarang.  [[HMS_Telemachus_(P321)|HMS Telemachus]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael White, Australian Submarines volume 2, pg 1302 ATOM 2015&lt;/ref&gt; arrived at the location but owing to bad weather after 3 days Lt Cdr [[Bill_King_(Royal_Navy_officer)|W D A King]] RN abandoned the landing and proceeded with the patrol before returning to Fremantle via Darwin where Buxton was disembarked on 30 March 1945.[[File:USS Blueback ss326.jpg|thumb|USS Blueback ss326|right]]

On 12 May 1945 Buxton left Fremantle aboard [[USS_Blueback_(SS-326)|USS Blueback]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael White, Australian Submarines volume 2, pg 1315 ATOM 2015&lt;/ref&gt; (Lt Cdr M K Clementson USN). He was successfully inserted at Cape Piring on 19 May 1945 and after obtaining identity documents made his way to Semarang.  Buxton was able to recruit a group of local men who were willing to help the allies and then the Japanese surrendered.  He made contact with Lt Col [[Laurens_van_der_Post|van der Post]] and the newly arrived allies in Batavia and was then returned to Australia via Singapore.

After the war Buxton left the army and joined the RAAF but because he could not prove his British nationality he was ordered to leave Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=4309745|title=BUXTON JOHN CHARLES |date=1939-1948|via=National Archives in Australia|accessdate=25 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525052726/https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=4309745|archivedate=25 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1949 he gained permission to enter New Caledonia and join the French Foreign Legion.  He was assigned to the [[3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment]], amphibious division.  In May 1954 he was wounded at the [[Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu|Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] and died 3 weeks later.

'''Paul Frederic Bennewitz, Jr.''' (September 29, 1927 - June 23, 2003) was an [[United States|American]] businessman and [[UFO]] investigator who originated [[UFO conspiracy theory|UFO conspiracy theories]] in the 1980s. He was the son of Stella A. Sharp and Paul Frederic Bennewitz, Sr. (1900-1949).

==Overview==
Bennewitz claimed the existence of a plot involving an extensive network of UFO bases tied to an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] colonization and control scheme to subjugate the human race. After he saw the hypnosis sessions of Myrna Hansen, who claimed to have UFO experiences, he became convinced that [[cattle mutilation]]s were due to aliens. As a result, Bennewitz claimed to have uncovered evidence of aliens controlling humans through electromagnetic devices, and furthermore claimed that UFOs were regularly flying near [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] and the nearby Manzano [[Nuclear Weapons]] Storage Facility and Coyote Canyon Test Area.&lt;ref name="Donovan2011" /&gt;

Convinced that he was intercepting electronic communications originating from alien spacecraft located outside of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], Bennewitz soon believed that he had located a secret alien facility that he called [[Dulce Base]]. By 1982, Bennewitz began to spread his ideas regarding Dulce Base to others in the [[UFOlogy]] community. In 1988 he wrote a paper entitled "Project Beta" detailing how the base might be successfully attacked.&lt;ref name="Barkun2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Barkun|title=A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA111|accessdate=16 April 2012|date=4 May 2006|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-24812-0|pages=111–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennewitz detailed his assertions to the [[Aerial Phenomena Research Organization]], who regarded him as a [[delusion|deluded]] [[Paranoia|paranoid]]. UFOlogist [[Bill Moore (ufologist)|William Moore]] claims that he tried to push Bennewitz, who had been in a mental health facility on three occasions after suffering severe delusional paranoia, into a mental breakdown by feeding him false information about aliens.&lt;ref name="Donovan2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barna William Donovan|title=Conspiracy Films: A Tour of Dark Places in the American Conscious|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJkhqU1IXHAC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=Conspiracy+Films:+A+Tour+of+Dark+Places+in+the+American+Conscious+bennewitz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CGqMT6rfHOf40gHK0o3bCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 April 2012|date=24 July 2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3901-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former special agent for the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations Richard Doty claimed that in the 1980s he was tasked with hoaxing documents and feeding false information to UFO researchers, including Bennewitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rojas|first1=Alejandro|title=Ex-Air Force Law Enforcement Agent Says He Hoaxed Major UFO Mythologies Posted: 05/13/2014 7:48 pm EDT|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alejandro-rojas/exair-force-law-enforceme_b_5312650.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 1996 El-Sayah was named by the Synod of the Maronites to the [[Archeparchy of Haifa and the Holy Land]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/haif0.htm gcatholic.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Northern Israel in the Galilee as well as to  [[Maronite Catholic Patriarchal Exarchate of Jordan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/jord0.htm gcatholic.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maronite Catholic Patriarchal Exarchate of Jerusalem and Palestine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/jeru5.htm gcatholic.org]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He received his episcopal consecration on October 5, 1996 by [[Nasrallah Pierre Cardinal Sfeir]], [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Maronite Patriarch of Antioch]] and his co-consecrators were [[Boutros Gemayel]], archbishop of the Archeparchy of Cyprus, and [[Roland Aboujaoudé]], [[Auxiliary Bishop|Auxiliary bishop]] of Antioch.

Paul Nabil El-Sayah called for a more consensual coexistence of Christian denominations in the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120711075221/http://kathpress.vivolum.net/site/focus/archivmeldungen/nahostsynode/article/663.html kathpress.vivolum.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Skewes''' (born 1957) is an American university professor and political activist best known for his candidacy for [[president of the United States]] as the nominee of the [[American Party of South Carolina]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]].

==Early life and education==
Skewes was born in [[Glastonbury, Connecticut]], and earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Forensic Science]] from the [[University of New Haven]] in 1979, going on to receive a [[Master of Science]] in Poultry Physiology from the [[University of Florida]] in 1982 and a [[Ph.D.]] in Animal Physiology from [[Virginia Tech]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="clemson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Skewes|url=http://www.clemson.edu/cafls/faculty_staff/profiles/pskewes|website=clemson.edu|publisher=[[Clemson University]]|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PETER SKEWES|url=http://www.americanpartysc.com/peter-skewes.html|website=americanpartysc.com|publisher=[[American Party of South Carolina]]|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the 1985 recipient of the Graduate Student Research Manuscript Award from the [[Poultry Science Association]].&lt;ref name="ps"/&gt;

==Career==

===Academia===
Skewes began teaching animal and veterinary science at [[Clemson University]] in 1985; there, he studies [[animal welfare]] issues and the behavior of [[domestic animal]]s.&lt;ref name="chester"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Travis|title=Skewes walks the walk|url=http://www.onlinechester.com/content/skewes-walks-walk|accessdate=3 August 2016|work=Chester News and Reporter|date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamagna|first1=Maria|title=The short life of a chicken is about to improve — guess who's paying for it?|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-life-of-a-chicken-is-about-to-improve-guess-whos-paying-for-it-2016-07-01|accessdate=3 August 2016|work=[[MarketWatch]]|date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Clemson, in addition to his teaching and research duties, Skewes served as chair of the university's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brutzman|first1=Anna|title=Clemson officials: Lab animal investigations prompted change|url=http://www.independentmail.com/news/education/clemson-officials-lab-animal-investigations-prompted-change-ep-412956809-349203261.html|accessdate=3 August 2016|work=Independent Mail|date=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skewes also serves on the editorial board of the scholarly journal ''[[Poultry Science Association|Poultry Science]]''.&lt;ref name="ps"&gt;{{cite news|title=Association Notes|url=http://ps.oxfordjournals.org/content/93/12/local/back-matter.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2016|work=Poultry Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
In May 2016 Skewes won the nomination of the [[American Party of South Carolina]] in a three-way contest; the party had been founded in 2014 by former South Carolina Superintendent of Education [[Jim Rex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=American Party of SC nominates candidates for a handful of offices|url=http://www.wrhi.com/2016/05/american-party-of-sc-nominates-candidates-for-a-handful-of-offices-125200|accessdate=3 August 2016|work=[[WRHI]]|date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Skewes, he was motivated to run for president because, for the first time in his life he was "not going to be able to vote for the president with a clear conscience", regardless of which of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates were ultimately nominated by their respective parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clemson professor walking 240 miles in campaign for president as American Party candidate|url=http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/local/pickens-county/2016/07/18/clemson-professor-walking-240-miles-campaign-president-american-party-candidate/87259600/|accessdate=3 August 2016|work=Greenville Online|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his campaign, he walked 240 miles across [[South Carolina]] as part of a [[publicity stunt]] to raise awareness for his candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnett|first1=Ron|title=Clemson professor walking 240 miles in campaign for president|url=http://www.heraldonline.com/news/local/article90778197.html|accessdate=3 August 2016|work=[[Greenville News]]|date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rex commented on Skewes' walk that it was "a testament to the fact that the American Party has an ability to attract a different type of person to run for public office".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PHOTO: No "stop" in this presidential candidate, party says|url=http://www.statehousereport.com/2016/07/29/photo-no-stop-in-this-presidential-candidate-party-says/|accessdate=4 August 2016|work=Statehouse Report|publisher=Statehouse Report LLC|date=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Skewes' campaign website, he advocated eliminating [[Super PAC]]s, abolishing the [[United States Electoral College]], supporting family planning education to "reduce unplanned pregnancies", and instituting "a national drug registry to reduce abuse of prescription drugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Platform|url=https://peterforpresident.us/stable-country/|website=peterforpresident.us|publisher=Peter Skewes for President|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skewes told the ''[[Greenville News]]'' that he would consider his candidacy a success if he placed third in the presidential vote in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clemson professor walking 240 miles in campaign for president|url=http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article90739427.html|accessdate=4 August 2016|work=[[Greenville News]]|publisher=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]|date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skewes ultimately placed eighth out of eight candidates, receiving 3,221 votes, or about 0.2-percent of the total ballots cast in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Overall 2016 South Carolina Presidential Election Results|url=http://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president/south-carolina/|accessdate=11 November 2016|work=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

=== Sterling-Winthrop case ===

In 1986, Wilmshurst, a [[cardiology|cardiologist]] then working at [[St. Thomas' Hospital]], London, approached ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper with a substantial dossier detailing alleged misconduct in the development of [[Amrinone]], a cardiac drug manufactured by [[Sterling-Winthrop]]. The drug was supported by a study at [[Harvard Medical School]] and published in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], whose lead author was [[Eugene Braunwald]], a leader in his field. Wilmshurst's group ran a series of experiments on the promising new drug but found no effect on [[contractility]] and frequent life-threatening [[side effect]]s. Wilmshurst reported these findings to Sterling-Winthrop, who asked him to suppress the data. He refused, and they retaliated by threatening litigation. He continued the research and published his adverse findings in abstracts and conference presentations, until Sterling-Winthrop staff removed all stocks of the drug from the hospital pharmacy. A review by the Netherlands Committee for the Evaluation of Medicine found substantial discrepancies between the record cards of Wilmshurst's group and those submitted by Sterling-Winthrop. Wilmshurst showed that they had falsified the records, suppressing the adverse events he had reported. He then contacted the UK's Committee for the Safety of Medicines and discovered that Sterling-Winthrop had also failed to report the adverse events to the UK; they had also threatened the UK Government with closure of a large manufacturing plant in the UK. Sterling-Winthrop subsequently reported over 1,400 adverse events to the US Federal [[Food and Drug Administration]], and terminated research and marketing in the US, while continuing to market the drug in the developing world. Finally, after a substantial ''Guardian'' feature, they withdrew the oral drug entirely in 1986.&lt;ref name="BMJ-Smith"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2012/10/10/richard-smith-a-successful-and-cheerful-whistleblower/ | title=Richard Smith: A successful and cheerful whistleblower | publisher=''[[BMJ]]'' | work=BMJ blog | accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SWJPCC" /&gt; In 2003 he was given the Health Watch Award for this work.&lt;ref name="SenseAboutSci"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/british-cardiologist-sued-by-american-company-for-a-canadian-article.html | title=British cardiologist sued by American company for a Canadian article | publisher=Sense About Science | accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NMT Medical case ===

In 2000, Wilmshurst published a paper linking [[migraine]] to [[patent foramen ovale]], a common cardiac condition affecting up to one in four people. This led [[NMT Medical]] to develop a PFO closure device branded [[STARflex]]. Wilmshurst was recruited as part of the "Migraine Intervention with STARflex Technology" (MIST) trial. The number of patients and potential value of the market (estimated in excess of $15bn) drove NMT's stock price to $25/share. A substantial discrepancy emerged between [[echocardiogram]] result interpretations of the implanting cardiologists and Wilmshurst's review. Wilmshurst reported a significantly higher proportion (one in three versus four in sixty-five) with residual [[cardiac shunt]]s. An independent review backed Wilmshurst's figures.&lt;ref name="SWJPCC" /&gt; Less than a fortnight after returning from a conference in Washington where he discussed his results, Wilmshurst was contacted by lawyers for NMT making accusations of "seriously defamatory allegations". The first NMT libel suit was lodged in 2007, and drew media attention.&lt;ref name="BBC-intensifies"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11678725 | title=NMT libel case intensifies for cardiologist |author= Ghosh, Pallab |date=November 2, 2010 | work=BBC News | accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NMT served four separate writs on Wilmshurst. The courts demanded that they lodge £200,000 due to their parlous financial state and the likelihood of failing in the action.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Setback"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/dec/01/company-suing-peter-wilmshurst-libel |author=Sample, Ian |date=December 1, 2010 | title=Setback for US company suing cardiologist Peter Wilmshurst for libel | work=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NMT declared bankruptcy after pursuing Wilmshurst for over three years.&lt;ref name="Guardian-Bankrupt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/21/us-company-suing-doctor-libel | title=US company suing British doctor for libel goes out of business | work=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bawa-Garba Case ===
In light of the [[Hadiza Bawa-Garba case]], Dr Peter Wilmhurst has both referred himself to the GMC, as well as asking the regulatory body to both remove himself from the register, and scrutinise his medical practice. This is due to the ongoing concern felt by medical practitioners in England with the GMC's outcome and appeal (successfully won) against Bawa-Garba. Multiple parties have been concerned about the outcome of this hearing, as well as the repercussions on current medical practice.&lt;ref name="Urged-Reporting"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.k481 | title=Expert urges doctors to report themselves to GMC | work=[[The BMJ]] | accessdate=Feb 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Libel reform ==

Wilmshurst's experience, along with [[British Chiropractic Association v Singh]], have been cited as catalysts for the UK's libel reform campaign, leading to the [[Defamation Act 2013]].&lt;ref name="THES"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/opinion/defamation-act-2013-what-scientists-need-to-know/2010434.article | title=What does the Defamation Act mean for academics? | work=Times Higher Education Supplement | date=2014-01-16 | accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IrishTimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/defamation-actions-which-can-chill-or-stifle-scientific-debate-1.681019 | title=Defamation actions which can chill or stifle scientific debate | work=Irish Times | date=2010-06-21 | accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndexOnCensorship"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.indexoncensorship.org/tag/peter-wilmshurst/ | title=Five ludicrous libel cases | publisher=Index On Censorship | accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''guerra dels armanyaguesos'' in 1389, Ramon led a regiment of [[cavalry]] in the area around [[Torroella de Montgrí]] and [[Palafrugell]].&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Gerónimo Zurita]], ''Anales'', X, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The young poet [[Guillem de Masdovelles]] fought under Ramon in these campaigns against [[Bernard VII of Armagnac]] and composed a ''[[sirventesch]]'' dedicated to him. It was probably sometime before this war that Ramon had a falling out with [[Guerau de Queralt i de Rocabertí]].

In 1392 Ramon purchased the castle of [[Solivella]] and its jurisdiction, both high and low, for 16,500 Aragonese ''[[Solidus (coin)#France|sous]]'' from John I. From 1395 to 1397 and again from 1398 to 1401 he served as governor of the [[Kingdom of Majorca]]. His lieutenant was [[Berenguer de Montagut]].

'''Samuel Parris''' (1653{{spaced ndash}}February 27, 1720) was the [[Puritanism|Puritan]] minister in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] during the [[Salem witch trials]]. He was also the father of one of the afflicted girls, and the uncle of another.{{sfn|Gragg|1990}}

==Life and career==
Samuel Parris, son of Thomas Parris, was born in [[London]], England to a family of modest financial success and religious nonconformity.{{sfn|Gragg|1990|pp=1–2}} Samuel immigrated to [[Boston]] in the early 1660s, where he attended [[Harvard College]] at his father's behest. When his father died in 1673, Samuel left Harvard to take up his inheritance in [[Barbados]], where he maintained a sugar plantation.

In 1680, after a hurricane hit Barbados, damaging much of his property, Parris sold a little of his land and returned to Boston, where he brought his slave Tituba and married Elizabeth Eldridge.{{sfn|Gragg|1990|pp=14–32}} Eldridge was noted by many as being incredibly beautiful, and was said to be one of the most beautiful women in Salem Village.&lt;ref name="acab" /&gt;{{sfn|Fisk|1704}} Together they had three children, Thomas Parris, [[Elizabeth Parris]], and Susannah Parris. Although the plantation supported his merchant ventures, Parris was dissatisfied with his lack of financial security and began to look to the ministry. In July 1689, he became [[Religious minister|minister]] of Salem Village (now [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]]), Massachusetts.

Salem Village was a contentious place to live and was known to be quarrelsome by neighbouring towns and villages.{{sfn|Gragg|1990|pp=39–76}} Its dispersed settlement pattern may have resulted in a lack of a sense of common purpose that may have united more orderly and arranged communities.{{sfn|Gragg|1990|pp=45–46}} Parris was the fourth minister appointed in a series of unsuccessful attempts to keep a permanent minister. James Bayley (1673–79) and [[George Burroughs]] (1680–83) each stayed only a few years, departing after the congregation failed to pay their full rates. [[Deodat Lawson]] (1684–88) left with less contention. Further tension was caused by Parris' delay in accepting the position and his inability to resolve his parishioners' disputes. There were also disputes over Parris' compensation. In October 1691, the town decided to stop paying his wages. The issue was further antagonized by Parris' perceived arrogance when he purchased gold candlesticks for the meetinghouse and new vessels for the sacraments. These issues, and others that were more personal between the villagers, continued to grow unabated.{{sfn|1949|pp=26–28}}

The events which led to the [[Salem witch trials]] began when Parris' daughter, [[Betty Parris|Betty]], and her cousin, [[Abigail Williams (Salem witch trials)|Abigail Williams]], accused Parris' slave [[Tituba]] of [[witchcraft]]. Parris beat Tituba until she confessed herself a witch, and John Indian, her husband, began accusing others. The delusion spread, many were apprehended, most of whom were imprisoned. During the 16-month duration of the Salem witch trials phenomenon, 19 persons were hanged, and one, [[Giles Corey]], was pressed to death.

During a 1692 sermon, Parris declared that "as in our text [John 6:10] there was one [devil] among the 12 [disciples]… so in our churches God knows how many Devils there are," encouraging antagonistic villagers to locate and destroy "witches" who, as it happened, were frequently individuals with whom Parris and his key allies, the Putnam family, had taken umbrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historyofmassachusetts.org/reverend-samuel-parris/|title=Reverend Samuel Parris: Was He to Blame for the Salem Witch Trials?|author=Rebecca Beatrice Brooks |date=September 8, 2015|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Parris had been an active prosecutor in the witchcraft cases, in 1693, his parish brought charges against Parris for his part in the trials.&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|Fisk|1900}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rines|1920}} Parris apologized in his essay ''Meditations for Peace'', which he presented in November 1694.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{harvnb|Stearns|1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Increase Mather]] led a church council which then vindicated him.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

Parris was then involved in a dispute with his congregation over parsonage land he had seized to compensate himself for salary he was owed. The dispute found its way to an [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]] court, which, in 1697, ordered his salary to be paid and the land to be returned.  By 1696, however, he had found his situation untenable. He resigned that year and left Salem. Records in the ''[[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] Deeds'' indicate it likely he returned to business in Boston in 1697.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

His wife Elizabeth died in 1696. In 1699, he remarried, to Dorothy Noyes, in Sudbury.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; He preached two or three years at [[Stow, Massachusetts|Stow]]. He then moved to [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] (1704/05).&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab/&gt; He also preached six months in [[Dunstable, Massachusetts|Dunstable]] in 1711.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt; He died on February 27, 1720, in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]].&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

==Fiction==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Parris features in [[Arthur Miller]]'s play ''[[The Crucible]],'' set against the backdrop of the [[Salem Witch Trials|witch trials]]. In the play, his daughter [[Elizabeth Parris]] is the first to become ill because of supposed and she is accused of [[witchcraft]]. In the [[The Crucible (1957 film)|1957]] and [[The Crucible (1996 film)|1996]] film adaptations of Miller's play, he was portrayed by [[Jean Debucourt]] and [[Bruce Davison]], respectively.

Parris is also a character in ''[[Tituba of Salem Village]]'' by [[Ann Petry]], another work of fiction relating to the witch trials.

In the novel ''Supernatural: One Year Gone'', Parris is portrayed as having been manipulated by the real witches into starting the trials and also manipulated the girls to accuse his enemies and rivals to get rid of them. At the end of the novel, after the truth is revealed, he swears to put an end to the innocent women.

'''Rufus George Perryman''' (October 23, 1892 – January 2, 1973),&lt;ref name="eagle"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Bob| last1= Eagle| first2= Eric S.| last2= LeBlanc| year= 2013| title= Blues: A Regional Experience| edition= | publisher= Praeger| location= Santa Barbara, California| pages= 269| isbn= 978-0313344237}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as '''Speckled Red''', was an American [[blues]] and [[boogie-woogie]] piano player and singer&lt;ref name="Music"/&gt; noted for his recordings of "The [[Dirty Dozens]]", exchanges of insults and vulgar remarks that have long been a part of [[African-American]] folklore.

==Life and career==
Speckled Red was born in [[Hampton, Georgia]]. He was the older brother of [[Piano Red]]. Their nicknames were derived from both men being [[albino]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/encyclopaedia/s/S171.HTM |title=– Speckled Red |work=MusicWeb Encyclopaedia of Popular Music |publisher=MusicWeb-International.com |accessdate=2008-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023002447/http://www.musicweb-international.com/encyclopaedia/s/S171.HTM |archivedate=October 23, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers were separated by almost a generation and never recorded together. Speckled Red and Piano Red both played in a raucous goodtime barrelhouse boogie-woogie style, although Speckled Red played slow blues more often. Both recorded versions of "The Right String (But the Wrong Yo-Yo)", Speckled Red in 1930 and Piano Red, who had a hit with the song 20 years later.

Prior to his birth the family had moved for brief periods to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], and then [[Atlanta, Georgia]], after his father violated Jim Crow laws, before settling in [[Hampton, Georgia]]. The family, consisting of Perryman and seven brothers and sisters, had little musical background. Speckled Red was a self-taught piano player,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnlink.emory.edu/~libmlm/pianored.html |title=Piano Red |publisher=Leanlink.emory.edu |accessdate=2008-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706133714/http://www.learnlink.emory.edu/~libmlm/pianored.html |archivedate=July 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced primarily by his idol Fishtail and by [[Charlie Spand]], James Hemingway and [[William Ezell]] and initially inspired by Paul Seminole in a movie theatre. He also learned to play the organ at his church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/music/artist/bio/0,,495891,00.html#bio|title=Piano Red|publisher=Artistdirect.com | accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By his mid-teens he was playing house parties and juke joints. He moved back to Detroit in his mid-20s to play anywhere he could, including nightclubs and brothels, and was noticed by a Brunswick Records talent scout just before he left for [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where he was located by Jim Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delmark.com/delmark.601.htm|title=Speckled Red – The Dirty Dozens|publisher=Delmar.com|accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was here that he had his first recording sessions, resulting in two classics for Brunswick, "Wilkins Street Stomp" and the hit "The Dirty Dozens". Although the lyrics were sung rather than spoken, with its elaborate [[word play|wordplay]] and earthy subject matter, "The Dirty Dozens" is considered in some respects a precursor of [[rap music]].

"I want all you women to fall in line&lt;br&gt;
"And shake yo shimmy like i'm shakin' mine&lt;br&gt;
"You shake yo shimmy and you shake it fast&lt;br&gt;
"If you can't shake the shimmy, shake yo' yas yas yas"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
"You a dirty mistreater, a robber and a cheater&lt;br&gt;
"Stick you in a dozens and yo pappy is yo cousin&lt;br&gt;
"And yo mama do the lawdylawd"

The following year, 1930, he recorded again, this time in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], resulting in most notably "The Dirty Dozens No. 2," which was not nearly as successful and the pianist was without a contract or label and again playing making the rounds at Memphis venues and in St. Louis bars. His 1938 session work in [[Aurora, Illinois]], with the [[slide guitar]] player [[Robert Nighthawk]] and the [[mandolinist]] Willie Hatcher for [[Bluebird Records]], was steady and long but also unsuccessful, and sometime in the 1940s he moved back to St. Louis and continued his career of playing in taverns. He also worked as a laborer in a public produce market until servicemen returned home to heavy lifting jobs.

==Revival and death==
Charlie O'Brien, a St. Louis policeman and something of a blues aficionado who applied many of his professional investigative methods to track down old bluesmen during the 1950s, "rediscovered" Speckled Red on December 14, 1954, who subsequently was signed to [[Delmark Records]] as the label's first blues artist. He experienced a small revival of interest in his music during the late 1950s and 1960s, his abilities still considerable, and worked around the St. Louis-area jazz scene, regularly as the intermission pianist for the Dixie Stompers, performing concerts with Dixie Mantinee and the St. Louis Jazz Club, played the Goldenrod Showboat, and played the [[University of Chicago Folk Festival]] in 1961, went to [[Dayton]], Ohio, with [[Gene Mayl]]'s Dixieland Rhythm Kings, and toured Europe in 1959 with [[Chris Barber]]. Several recordings were made in 1956 and 1957 for the Tone, Delmark, [[Folkways Records|Folkways]], and Storyville record labels.

His age, however, had become a factor, and the remainder of the 1960s saw scattered performances. He died of cancer on January 2, 1973, in St. Louis, at the age of 80.&lt;ref name="Dead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/1970.html|title=The Dead Rock Stars Club: The 1970s|publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodora Kantakouzene''' ({{lang-el|Θεοδώρα Καντακουζηνή}}; died after 1381) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] princess, the daughter of Emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] and the fifth wife of the [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Orhan Gazi]].{{sfn|PLP|loc=10940. &lt;Καντακουζηνὴ&gt; Θεοδώρα}}

== Life ==
Theodora was one of the three daughters of Emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] by his wife [[Irene Asanina]]. The historian [[Nikephoros Gregoras]] erroneously calls her "Maria" in one passage.{{sfn|PLP|loc=10940. &lt;Καντακουζηνὴ&gt; Θεοδώρα}} In January 1346, to cement her father's alliance with the rising [[Ottoman emirate]] and to prevent the Ottomans from giving their aid to the Empress-regent [[Anna of Savoy]] during the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–47|ongoing civil war]], she was betrothed to the Ottoman ruler, [[Orhan Gazi]].{{sfn|Nicol|1996|pp=76–77}} The marriage took place in the summer of the same year. Her parents and sisters escorted her to [[Selymbria]], where Orhan's representatives, including grandees of his court and a cavalry regiment, arrived on a fleet of 30 ships. A ceremony was held at Selymbria, where Orhan's envoys received her and escorted her to the Ottoman lands in [[Bithynia]], across the [[Marmara Sea]], where the actual wedding took place.{{sfn|Nicol|1996|pp=77–78}}

Theodora remained a Christian after her marriage, and was active in supporting the Christians living under Ottoman rule.{{sfn|PLP|loc=10940. &lt;Καντακουζηνὴ&gt; Θεοδώρα}}{{sfn|Nicol|1996|p=78}} In 1347 she gave birth to her only son, [[Şehzade Halil]], who was captured by Genoese pirates for ransom while still only a child. The Byzantine emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] was instrumental in his eventual release. Later, Halil married Irene, a daughter of John V Palaiologos and Theodora's sister, [[Helena Kantakouzene]].

Except for a three-day sojourn in Constantinople in February 1347, in the aftermath of her father's victory in the civil war,{{sfn|Nicol|1996|p=89}} Theodora remained at the Ottoman court until Orhan's death in 1362. After that, she apparently returned to Constantinople, where she lived with her sister, the Empress [[Helena Kantakouzene|Helena]], in the palace.{{sfn|PLP|loc=10940. &lt;Καντακουζηνὴ&gt; Θεοδώρα}}{{sfn|Nicol|1996|pp=146, 179}} She is last known to have been held imprisoned at [[Galata]] during the brief reign of [[Andronikos IV Palaiologos]] there in 1379–81.{{sfn|PLP|loc=10940. &lt;Καντακουζηνὴ&gt; Θεοδώρα}}

==Depictions in fiction==

A fictionalised form of her character is the subject of [[Bertrice Small]]'s novel ''[[Adora (novel)|Adora]]'', published 1980.

'''William Johnson McDonald''' (December 21, 1844 &amp;ndash; February 8, 1926, though some sources give his date of death as February 6
) was a [[Paris, Texas]] banker who left $850,000 (the bulk of his fortune) to the [[University of Texas System]] to endow an astronomical observatory.&lt;ref name="EvansMulholland2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David S. Evans|author2=J. Derral Mulholland|title=Big and Bright: A History of the McDonald Observatory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVbUAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165|date=13 September 2013|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=978-0-292-75900-8|pages=165–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bequest was unexpected, and his will was contested, but after prolonged legal disputes the university received the money.&lt;ref name="HTO" /&gt; At the time, the university had no faculty of astronomy, so in 1932 it formed a collaboration with [[Otto Struve]] at the [[University of Chicago]], who supplied astronomers.

The [[McDonald Observatory]] is named after him, with Otto Struve becoming the first director.

McDonald was the eldest of the three sons of Sarah Johnson and Henry Graham McDonald of [[Paris, Texas]]. As a young man, he was a private in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army.&lt;ref name="UCL" /&gt; He became wealthy through his businesses as a lawyer and a banker, but remained frugal his entire life. He never married and had no children.&lt;ref name="HTO" /&gt;

From the 2000s until his death, he was a controversial figure in the eyes of the public and fought against [[LGBT rights opposition|opponents of homosexuality]] and homosexual psychopath theorists. Throughout his school years, he had been pushed away from a similar peer group. In December 2002, he planned to leave school in order to attend [[Seil High School]]. From 1999 to 2003, he was active in the anti-LGBT discrimination movement, the [[LGBT rights movement]], and homophobia opposition movement.

His family were school teachers.&lt;ref name="rapido"&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/584808.html 나의 일곱번째 친구는 누구입니까] Hamgyeorye 2013.04.26 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was bullied throughout his school years, and eventually dropped out of Incheon High School in 2002.&lt;ref name="suja"&gt;[http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=10130417112314 "가식적인 기독교에 깨달음을"…어느 10대의 죽음] 프레시안 2013.04.21&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this bullying, he often took tranquillisers, and sleeping pills.&lt;ref name="clemen"&gt;[http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0000121232&amp;CMPT_CD=A0289 "슬퍼 맙시다. 다시 떠나보내지 맙시다"] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140324183754/http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0000121232&amp;CMPT_CD=A0289 |date=March 24, 2014 }} Ohmynews 2003.05.04 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Yun was part of discussions and disputes on the Internet forums, and endured a great deal of homophobia until his death. Yun created an Interpia 98 homepage, but his website was visited by an internet terrorist, and due to personal attacks in 2002, he closed his homepage.

He awoke to his sexual identity during his time in middle school. He was recognized for his [[sexual identity problems]], and as a result of this, he was picked on.&lt;ref name="bhitto"&gt;[http://www.sisapress.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7901 죽음으로 마감한 ‘커밍아웃’] The Sisajournal 2003.05.15 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was excluded by his peer group and his neighbourhood due to discrimination.&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; On October 8, 2002, he was sent to a psychiatric clinic by his family, despite his emphatic claims that he was not a psychopath.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; He was dependent on [[green tea]] (녹차), rosary, tobacco, alcohol, foundation and hypnotics,&lt;ref name="clemen"/&gt; which became known metaphorically as his "six friends"&lt;ref name="rapido"/&gt; as Korean writer [[Kwak Byong-chan]] was based on his one nickname ''Yook Woo-dang'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/opinion/column/588397.html 지상에 천국을 일군 한 동성애인의 꿈] Hangyeorye 2013.05.21 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also means "six friends" in the Hangul language. In his last years of life, it was Yun's favorite phrase for the majority of his activity and content, and was used as a signature.

His family disapproved of his [[homosexuality]] and [[homophobia|pressured him to be heterosexual]], but Yun said, "I can't be heterosexual and don't want to be heterosexual.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt;" He was thoroughly isolated, about which he would complain in his diary. In October 2002, one diary entry from Yun said, "I do not think I'm abnormal. In this world born and living right-handed, also naturally left-handed is born and living. This road exists as also another road exists. Most persons use the well-worn path, but I have to go on a lone desolate path.&lt;ref name="suja"/&gt;" He enjoyed reading, ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' and ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''.

=== Poetry and writings ===
During his adolescence, he tried to drown his pain in writing and also went to volunteer in orphanages and disabled groups. Some famous quotes from his works include the following:

: ''"The world is hatred to like monster for we / So we living lurking place here and there / do you know, but this we is one of human. (Complain)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20130423029028 “동성애는 사람이 사람 좋아하는 문제… 이상한가요”] The Seoulnews 2013-04-23, 29 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;"''

: ''"Before you say, going to heaven to believe in Jesus Christ/ Pastor! begin with you first conduct. / after death, you when excuse see to Jesus?(one Pastor)&lt;ref name="didros"&gt;[http://www.mediatoday.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=109051 10년전 기독 청소년 ‘육우당’이 왜 목을 맨 지 아십니까?] 미디어오늘 2013.04.27 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;"''

Another famous poem by Yun, "Reborn", reads:

: ''"My soul was transform for the flower rain / after I went to your side / You are so insensibility to this me / Dear You please listen to My sweet soft whisper.&lt;ref name="suja" /&gt;"''

Yun hinted of the censorship present in South Korean society through his many works and stories. He often embedded satire within his poems, prose, novels and social criticism, yet still sang softly about love.

After completing elementary school, Yun wrote poetry and prose, but the majority of his work was given the notoriety to not be seen or read, due to his sexual identity. In his writings, he openly confessed his disappointment in prejudices and conventions, superstition and the remnants of blind faith, and the tradition of clinging to old customs, which strongly dominated the lives of many in South Korea.

: ''"Possibly before die, never I will not get a good evaluation eponymous poet. A heterosexual and asceticism and moralism, formalism aim for this society, because I am only just heretic and deviants.&lt;ref name="bhitto" /&gt;"''

He harbored ill feelings towards South Korean political leaders due to the institutionalized homophobia rampant in South Korea, and because the majority of South Korean political figures were opposed to homosexuality, feeling that it violated [[Conservatism|traditional social norms and values]].

He was deeply upset by the assertion by political figures that his work violated traditional Korean social mores, due to the conservative attitudes prevalent in South Korean society.&lt;ref name="bhitto"/&gt;

=== LGBT rights movement ===
From March 1, 2000, he attended [[Seil High-school]] in [[Bupyeong-gu]]. However, in December 2002, he dropped out of high school. After leaving school, he moved to the [[Dongdaemun District]] in [[Seoul]] and became involved in the literary and LGBT activist scene. Due to the widespread criticism of the homosexual themes in his writings, especially by fundamental Christians, he was unable to write under his real name despite wanting to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsmaker.khan.co.kr/khnm.html?mode=view&amp;code=115&amp;artid=201304291149471&amp; &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;특집| 차별금지법 논란&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;‘차별의 범위’에 무슨 내용 담겼길래?] wikly Kyonghyang 1024 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=3408 교회는 성(性)소수자를 향한 차별과 혐오에 침묵할 것인가?] Catollic news 2010.04.22 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he used the pseudonym Yook Woo Dang, a reference to the six objects he relied on most - green tea, cosmetic foundation, alcohol, tobacco, rosary beads and sleeping pills.

After the year 2000, Yun objected to the theory that [[HIV]] and related infections are directly transmitted by homosexuals, who were considered to be vectors for the virus. In his objection, he stated that the theory was a groundless assumption. Early on in the movement, he was a person who persuaded people that homophobia was unacceptable and fought against discriminatory objections to homosexuality on the internet. In January 2002, he became a long-distance activist. In January 2001, he joined the D [[Sijo]](시조 詩調) poet club and W Sijo poet club,&lt;ref name="bhitto"/&gt; with a rank as a student member. He continued his activity and contributed many writings, including poetry, to [[Sijo]] for a period of two years.&lt;ref name="bhitto"/&gt; In February 2001, he joined and later worked for the organization [[Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaus.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=14405 또 한 명의 게이가 자살하기를 바라는 건가] medias 2010.11.02 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became a [[conscientious objector]] to Korea's conscription military service.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; Yun emphasised that viewing homosexuality as sinful and denying acceptance for homosexuals as 'children of God' is wrong, whereas some Conservative Christian groups' ideology viewed it as anti-biblical activity.&lt;ref name="jonnon"&gt;[http://sarangbang.or.kr/kr/info/hrinput/hr_content.html?seqnum=11561 한 동성애자의 죽음을 통한 절규] 인권운동사랑방 No.2325, 2003.04.29 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn of 2002, Yun sought after more volunteers or full-time employees for the [[Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea]].&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; His earnest desires were approved for March of the following year.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt;

=== Other activity ===
In January 2003, he was hired to work in a gay bar in [[Gangnam-gu]], [[Seoul]]. However, due to anxiety, he soon retired from the job.&lt;ref name="bhitto"/&gt; Afterwards, parallel with several part-time jobs, he committed to become a civil and human rights activist. On March 24, 2003, he became a full-time employee of [[Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea]].&lt;ref name="suja"/&gt; He participated in media censorship-opposition movements. Yun was repetitively insistent, particularly with some South Koreans who were intent on trampling many artists, entertainers and writers, even though pop culture was fresh with a variety of creativity and various artists. They were condemned in the name of morals and ethics.

Yun was an LGBT rights activist, and during this time participated in the abolition movement of LGBT and LGBT related media which was regarded as "youth Harmful media specified"(청소년 유해 매체). At the same time, he always attended anti-war and peace rallies in Jongro, Seoul.&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; Slowly, he became the leading representative in anti-war and peace movements  as a guest speaker.&lt;ref name="bhitto"/&gt; Additionally, he participated in an opposition campaign in Seoul which aimed to prevent the government from sending troops overseas to participate in the [[Iraq War|Iraq war]].&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; On April 3, he was a determined participant in the [[Conscientious objector|Conscientious objection to military service]](양심적 병역 거부).&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; Yun declared his refusal the wholesale slaughter of innocent peoples. Also, he participated in the sex worker rights movement and antidiscrimination movements, sex workers discrimination opposition movements. also with joint to [[Ableism]] objection movements.

=== Conflict with fundamentalist Christianity ===
South Korean fundamentalist Christians and some South Korean Christian denominations hated on homosexuality. For a long time, fundamentalist Christians and some Christian denominations believed that homosexuals and transgender individuals were "crazy". In the year 2000, Yun disputed with them. Yun insisted that homosexuality was not a [[mental illness]] and that it was personal taste. Although Yun was a devout Catholic, there was an immense amount of criticism by Christianity on homosexuality. It is known that he largely despaired.&lt;ref name="ralbo"&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/rights/584469.html 소년의 자살 10년 지났지만…동성애 따가운 시선은 여전] The Hangyeorye 2013.04.24 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2003, the [[South Korea]]n [[National Human Rights Commission of Korea]] Association made a formal announcement that the LGBT and LGBT-related media regarded as "youth Harmful media specified" was human rights abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=4468 신앙인의 고뇌 담은 동성애자 이야기 발간] 가톨릭뉴스 지금여기 2010.12.08 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was welcoming and at the same time condemning of some of the more Christian groups, while government agencies instigated that there was sexual corruption. Yun debated them by setting forth counterarguments and objections to contribute to daily newspapers. Two day later, some South Korean conservative Christian groups said, "Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed to the wrath of God for judgment of sulfur, sexual depravity because homosexuals. the Bible strictly forbids homosexuality. Commission has to withdraw the decision.&lt;ref name="didros"/&gt;"; they argued that homosexuality disrupted the natural order and caused HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohmynews.com/nws_web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0001369587 동성애자 천주교 형제의 죽음, 그후 6년 변한 건 없다] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128114257/http://www.ohmynews.com/nws_web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0001369587 |date=January 28, 2015 }}  오마이뉴스 2010.04.22 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, he said:

"Homosexuals is one of people, ye is dangerous psychopath also see to one of Human, anyway ye is Homosexuals is only see to non-human animals, demons?"{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

He vigorously protested, but his objections were viewed to still not be acceptable, so on April 13 he made a real name contribution to Hnagyeorye:&lt;ref name="rasons"&gt;[http://legacy.www.hani.co.kr/section-001042000/2003/04/001042000200304131819236.html 동성애자도 인권 존중해야 약자희생 모는 편견 곤란] Hangyeorye 2003.04.13 {{ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, he withdrew from Catholic society, causing a backlash of Christian fundamentalist homophobia,&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; which was later taken back in the following two days.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; Afterwards, he prayed daily, with a desire for homosexuals to not be discriminated by his God.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt; Yun Hyon-seok was determined to commit suicide from this point, due to the anger and hatred against many homosexual Christians.

=== Death ===
In April 2003, Hyon-seok and other human-rights activists were making preparations for a May Day meeting.&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; For a long time, he was a devout Christian, despite the criticism from other Christians because of his sexual identity. Yun had been disappointed for a long time, but he was devoted to his religion.&lt;ref name="ripists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smualjung"/&gt; He had immediately suffered [[Homophobia|homosexual discrimination]] and contempt. On 26 April 2003, he committed suicide at Dongdaemun street in [[Seoul]] by hanging himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newamericamedia.org/2014/02/queer-rights-activists-in-south-korea-step-up-efforts-to-support-lgbtq-youth.php Queer Rights Activists in South Korea Step Up Efforts to Support LGBTQ Youth]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26 at 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm, Yun was reported to have been drinking alcohol.
