'''''Ahimsa''''' is an [[heritage register|heritage-listed]] residence and meditation meeting place located at 67 Cobran Road, [[Cheltenham, New South Wales|Cheltenham]], [[Hornsby Shire]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was designed by and built by [[Marie Byles]] during 1937. It is also known as '''''Ahimsa''''', '''''The Hut of Happy Omen''''' and '''''Sentosa'''''. The property is owned by the [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW). It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 1 March 2002.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5051253|Ahimsa|hr=01494|fn=H00/00225/001|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|Marie Byles}}
In 1935 [[Marie Beuzeville Byles]] purchased {{convert|3.5|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land on the outskirts of Cheltenham. A few years later she designed and built a small one-bedroom house. Perched on a large rock and built of unpainted fibro, oiled timber, random rubble and with a roof glazed terracotta the structure melds well with its bushland setting. Except for a vegetable garden near the house, the remainder of the site was left in its native state.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

Marie Byles shared with [[Walter Burley Griffin]] the objective of integrating structures with the natural landscape and vegetation. Although there is no documented record to prove that Griffin's work influenced her, it seems highly likely that she was favorably impressed by the houses he designed for her friends and sought to incorporate some of their qualities into ''Ahimsa''.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

Marie Byles was not an architect and, not surprisingly, her work as a designer is less accomplished than Griffin's. Some specific differences are that he preferred flat roofs while her house has a more conventional terracotta pitched roof; Griffin experimented with prefabricated building materials where as Marie used fibro (even in the 1930s this was a very conventional material); but they shared the goal of building small scale, understated and low cost houses which fitted unobtrusively into the Australian bush.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

Born in England in 1900, Byles studied law at [[The University of Sydney]] graduating in 1924 to become the first woman in NSW to practice as a solicitor. She was a remarkable woman who was passionately involved in preserving wilderness areas. She was a keen mountaineer and travelled to [[Norway]], [[China]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]] in search of unclimbed peaks. In 1938 she led an all women team in an attempt to scale a {{convert|6100|m|adj=on}} peak, [[Mount Sansate]] in Western China. The expedition failed due to adverse weather conditions. In Australia her determined, active nature led her to become an early lobbyist for what we now know as [[national park]]s.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

Byles was one of the early members of The Sydney Bushwalker's Club and was responsible for drawing the attention of the [[New South Wales Department of Lands|NSW Lands Department]] to the wilderness area around Maitland Bay on the central coast north of Sydney. She was appointed Trustee of [[Bouddi National Park]] and organised working bees amongst the bushwalkers to maintain the area.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

The [[Beecroft, New South Wales|Beecroft]]-Cheltenham Civic Trust was established by her as a "non-progress association" which worked for the closure of roads in the area and the planting of native trees and shrubs. She worked with the Bradley sisters (Joan and Eileen) to rid the bush of weeds around her property, and practiced organic gardening techniques all her life. She always slept outside on an open verandah, never drove a car, and walked everywhere, usually with a rucksack. 

In 1941 while on a bushwalk, where one of the members was taken ill, Byles shouldered his pack, his carriers and her own, and in consequence her feet were permanently damaged. From that time onwards she could manage short bushwalks only, and mountain climbing became impossible.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt; Always interested in eastern religions, in particular the ideas of [[Gandhi]], her disability gave her more time to research and write. In the late 1940s she took up medication and later traveled to [[India]] and [[Myanmar|Burma]] to undergo instruction. In the 1950s Byles built a hut in her garden called the Hut of Happy Omen, which she made available to meditation groups. By this time she had adopted the most ascetic form of South East Asian Buddhism.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

The name [[Ahimsa]] is derived from Gandhi's teachings and means peace or non-violence.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

One night in 1966, while sleeping on her open verandah Byles was physically assaulted and sustained serious injuries including a fractured skull. She declined to charge her assailant. After a period of convalescence she returned to live alone on the estate still sleeping out in the open air. Miss Byles gave up her legal practice in 1970, four years after the attack.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

In 1970 Miss Byles gave the property to the National Trust of Australia, remaining in residence as Honorary Curator. Concerned that the one-bedroom house might be too small for her successor, she developed a plan for an addition comprising a one room detached pavilion.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

Marie Byles died at ''Ahimsa'' on 21 November 1979.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494-2405&gt;{{Cite paper|title=Ahimsa - Cheltenham -Background Paper, Board Meeting no. 55, Agenda item 5j| author=Levins, Macarthur, Ecob, Marni, Gilbert| year=1995 | url=http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/portal/article/viewArticle/163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;&lt;!-- tricky quoting a ref from a searched link where SHR only quoted the authors and you'll have no way of reading it.  --&gt;

== Description ==
Ahimsa has an area of {{convert|1.348|ha}} and is [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]] with a much larger area of bushland, Pennant Hills Park, to the north.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494-2406&gt;Beecroft Cheltenham Civic Trust 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The vegetation is described as dry sclerophyll (hard leafed) bushland on [[Sydney sandstone]] and is typical of the flora associated with the Northern Hills District of Sydney.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

The northwest, northeast and part of the southeast boundaries are delimited by unmade road reserves, Malton Road (part) and Lyne Road (also known as Cobram Road). It is located on a small ridge, formerly and unofficially called Native Rose Ridge, on the inside of a sharp curve in a creek draining the Beecroft Cheltenham area. This creek subsequently joins [[Devlins Creek]]. The upper parts of ''Ahimsa'' are relatively flat but the groundslopes off in a series of small Hawkesbury Sandstone cliffs in a north by north-west direction to the fire trail and towards Pennant Hills Park. There are many flat sandstone outcrops and small cliffs.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

;Buildings 
The buildings include ''Ahimsa'', The Hut of Happy Omen, the toilets, which were all built before the land was sold to the Trust, Sentosa, a detached bedsitter which was approved in principle in November 1975. A [[carport]] was built onto The Hut in 1977. ''Ahimsa'' is a small one-bedroom house built of unpainted fibro, oiled timber and random rubble with a pitched roof of glazed terracotta. There is a brick fireplace in the living room and a large north-facing open [[Veranda|verandah]] looking over the gully. The Hut of Happy Omen is basically an open [[shed]] built of unpainted fibro with a roof of corrugated fibro. At some time it has been extended to incorporate a kitchenette and a shower stall. Sentosa is an open plan bedsitter also constructed of fibro with a [[skillion roof]] of corrugated fibro.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

Marie Byles' design principles are best expressed in this quotation from her: 'No Painting whatever anywhere - Any woodwork to be treated with linseed raw oil (saves unkeep): External walls are to be fibro; Corrugated (sic) fibro (long experience has shown fiber to be lasting, with no upkeep).'&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

Paths were made by volunteers and Marie Byles' bushwalking friends.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494-2407&gt;Levins 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

=== Condition ===

As at 27 June 2000, the physical condition was good.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

=== Modifications and dates ===
An absorption trench was constructed in 1975 to contain surface run off from properties adjacent to ''Ahimsa'' as the Trust was afraid that excessive run off would encourage weed growth.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

One cave has been altered and an attractive two metre high Hawkesbury Sandstone [[retaining wall]] was constructed many years ago near the path from the northern gate.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

Despite her wish that no plants foreign to it, even from other parts of Australia, should be planted several native plants not indigenous to Ahimsa have been planted.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494-2411/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
As at 27 January 2010, ''Ahimsa'' and surrounding landscape stand as a testimony to Marie Byles' life and vision as a feminist and a conservationist. These subjects are of increasing interest to contemporary Australians and are helping to share our culture. Aesthetically, the small scale understated buildings fit unobtrusively into the Australian bushland. The peaceful atmosphere of the property gives visitors an insight into the character of the woman who gave the property to the National Trust. The bushland and topographical features, and the property's close proximity to the state reserve next door, form an intact natural area indicative of the appearance of this area prior to human occupation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494-2407/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

''Ahimsa'' was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

The history of the property is very much the culmination of the ideology practiced by Marie Byles. Marie Byles has been one of the foremost protagonists of national parks as a mechanism to conserve nature. She was one of the early members of Sydney Bushwalkers' Club joining it in 1929 being a keen bushwalker. She was also the first woman lawyer in Australia, which gave her a certain amount of confidence. This confidence coupled with her interest and dedication to the cause of nature conservation became an asset to the nature conservation lobby in Australia. The creation of the Bouddi National Park is identified as a result of the unrelenting efforts by Marie Byles.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494-2411&gt;{{cite book|last=Maini|first=Rajeev|date=|title=Conservation Management Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

The small scale understated buildings fit unobtrusively into the Australian bushland. The peaceful atmosphere of the property gives the visitors an insight into the character of the woman who gave the property to the National Trust. The bushland and topographical features, and the property's close proximity with the state reserve next door form an intact natural area indicative of the appearance of this area prior to human occupation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494-2407/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

The buildings and their landscape stand as a testimony to Marie Byles' life and vision as a feminist and a conservationist. These subjects are of increasing interest to contemporary Australians and are helping to shape our culture.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494-2407/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The property as the only example of a manifestation of the concern for environmental issues and sustainable development in Australia. ''Ahimsa'' is an important active part of the ecosystem of [[Lane Cove National Park]] due to the topography of the property. Ahimsa is important as a soft visual edge to Lane Cove National Park and as a part of its visual image. An example of dry sclerophyll bushland on Sydney sandstone in the Northern Hills Region.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494-2411/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Uniqueness of the property as the only example of an early manifestation of the concern for environmental issues and sustainable development in Australia. Uniqueness of the property as the only example of the early efforts to introduce various sections of the society to living in harmony with nature by creating a physical focus (Hut of Happy Omens) and encouraging its use.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494-2411/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''

The property is representative of the beliefs of Marie Byles as a collection of rudimentary buildings in a bushland setting.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494-2408&gt;Ecob, Macarthur 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1494/&gt;&lt;!-- this isn't linked further in SHR either and it's not ont he link I showed for the other --&gt;

[[Sheikh]] '''Al-Hajj Salim Suwari''' was a 13th-century [[West African]] [[Soninke people|Soninke]] ''[[karamogo]]'' ([[Islamic]] scholar) who focused on the responsibilities of Muslims minorities residing in a non-Muslim society. He formulated an important theological rationale for [[Pacifism in Islam|peaceful]] coexistence with the non-Muslim ruling classes called the Suwarian tradition, which survives to this day despite the pressures of modernism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tv4TBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT131&amp;dq=Sheikh+Al-Hajj+Salim+Suwari+suwarian+tradition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPsqmr5fTXAhVm8IMKHehECMIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=suwarian%20tradition&amp;f=false|title=Native Peoples of the World: An Encyclopedia of Groups, Cultures and Contemporary Issues|last=Danver|first=Steven L.|date=2015-03-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317463993|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The spread of Islam throughout West Africa was a concomitant of long-distance trade by [[Mande languages|Mande]]-speaking Muslim traders and craftsmen known as ''Dyula''. Since Muslims in these regions lived in the ''dar al-kufr'' (House of Unbelievers), they needed legitimization for trading with unbelievers – an activity viewed with disdain by some North African Muslim jurists. Sheikh Al-Hajj Salim Suwari focused on providing a solution to this and other related issues. Hailing from the [[Sahelian]] town of [[Dia, Mali|Ja]] (Dia) in the core [[Mali]] area, Al-Hajj Salim Suwari had performed the pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]] several times and devoted his intellectual career to developing an understanding of the faith that would assist Muslim minorities in residing in "[[pagan]]" lands (''[[Divisions of the world in Islam|dar al-kufr]]'').

==Suwarian Tradition==
Sheikh Suwari formulated the obligations of [[Dyula people|Dyula]] minorities residing across West Africa into something dubbed the ''Suwarian tradition''. It stressed the need for Muslims to coexist peaceably with unbelievers, and so justified a separation of religion and politics. The Suwarian prescription for peaceful coexistence involved seven main precepts: (a) unbelievers are ignorant, not wicked: (b) it is Allah's design that some people remain ignorant longer than others: (c) Muslims must nurture their own learning and piety and thereby furnish good examples to non-Muslims around them, so they will know how to behave when they are converted: (d) they could accept the [[jurisdiction]] of non-Muslim authorities, as long as they had the necessary protection and conditions to practice the faith in accordance with the ''[[sunnah]]'' of the [[Prophet Muhammed]]. In this teaching Suwari followed a strong predilection in [[Political aspects of Islam|Islamic political philosophy]] for any government, albeit non-Muslim or tyrannical, as opposed to none: (e) The military ''[[jihad]]'' was a resort only in self-defense if the faithful were threatened. (f) Suwari discouraged ''[[dawah]]'' ([[proselytizing]]), instead contending that [[Allah]] would bring non-Muslims to Islam in His own way; it was not a Muslim's responsibility to decide when ignorance should give way to belief: (g) Muslims must ensure that, by their commitment to education and learning, they keep their observance of the Law free from error.&lt;ref&gt;See Wilks in Levtzion and Pouwels 2000:98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence of the Suwarian Tradition===
Suwarians articulate an ideological level, without straying from [[orthodoxy]], the peculiarities of the situation in which Muslims found themselves in the period following the collapse of [[Mali Empire|imperial Mali]]. Described by author Nehemia Levtzion as "accommodationist Islam", it created a praxis to enable Muslims to function within essentially non-Muslim societies, accommodating their interests to those of the wider society while at the same time combating erosion of their distinctive Muslim identity.&lt;ref&gt;N. Levtzion, ''Eighteenth Century Renewal &amp; Reform in Islam'', [[Syracuse University|Syracuse University Press]], 1987, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Since their form of Islam was capable of accommodating traditional cults, the ''dyula'' often served as priests, [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]]s and counselors at the courts of [[animist]] rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Launay, R., ''Beyond the Stream: Islam &amp; Society in a West African Town''. Berkeley, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The Suwarian tradition was a realistic rationale for Muslims living in the woodland and forest regions of West Africa over the past five or six centuries. It was not without tension that came in part from the missionary dimension of Islam itself; it was challenged by Muslim reformers in recent centuries. Its neat compartments were obscured by occasional intermarriage between merchants and rulers. But the Suwarian tradition was resilient and useful, and it is probably similar to the positions of many African Muslim communities who found themselves in situations of inferior numbers and force, took advantage of their networks for trade, and enjoyed good relations with their "pagan" hosts.&lt;ref&gt;David Robinson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jZEL3kdcQggC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=%22salim+suwari%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=54KSPv1hgr&amp;sig=Kcu6OC2WRz2tSbw0Fg3iNzSH81w&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kY4uSpP3MYyItAO4pdnCCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#PPA59,M1 ''Muslim Societies in African History'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of the Suwarian School==
Al-Hajj Salim's scholarly activity was centered on the town of [[Jagha]] in the ''[[Sudan (region)|bilâd as-sûdân]]'' (Western Sudan), but his influence was greatest along the southern fringes of the Manding trade network, and corresponds to the period of the disintegration of the old [[Mali Empire|Malian empire]]. From the accounts of [[Ivor Wilks]] and [[Lamin Sanneh]] it is difficult to date the lifespan of Salim Suwari. Wilks dates his life around the late 15th century, while Sanneh thinks he lived two centuries earlier, around the late 13th century. Differences notwithstanding, Wilks intimates that his teachings were nurtured by his followers in [[Niger]], [[Senegal]] and middle section of the Niger river from where they conveyed the tradition to the Voltaic region in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Wilks describes it as "pacifistic and quietist in content," implying a tolerant and respectful approach to non-Muslims, while in the words of Sanneh, one of the imperatives of the tradition is its "travel or mobility (''al-safar'') involving the penetration of distant lands for the purposes of religion."&lt;ref&gt;See Wilks, "''Wa and the Wala''," p. 98, and also Sanneh, "''The Crown and the Turban''," p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly Legacy==
The Suwari school of thought was a scholarly discipline that enjoyed a substantial number of ''[[ulema]]'' as well as a long history among West African Muslims. Ivor Wilks observes that "almost all of the ''[[isnad|asanid]]'', scholarly chains owned by Muslim scholars of [[Ghana]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[Burkina Faso]] converge on the highly revered figure of [[Kong Liman Abbas]]" whose own chain can be traced backwards "in twelve teaching generations to Al-Hajj Salim Suwari." Wilks traces a long chain of scholars and students that passed through the tradition of Suwari, ranging from Saghanugu Liman of [[Bobo-Dioulasso]] (Burkina Faso), Ibrahim bin al-Mustapha of [[Wa, Ghana]], Al-Amin bin Muhammad al-Abyad Kulibali of [[Kong, Côte d'Ivoire]] to Sa’id bin Abd al-Qadir, of Wa.

It may not be stretching the point to suggest that the same tradition of ''ulema'', especially the [[Kamaghaté]], [[Wattara]] of the [[Soninke Wangara]] [[patronym]], were the influential Muslims and traders in [[Kumasi]] in the years before the late 1890s when the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] Muslims migrated in large waves to Kumasi after the collapse of [[Salaga]]. It is probable that the Suwari tradition swept through greater parts of the [[Islam in Ghana|Ghanaian Muslim communities]] – Wenchi, Wa, [[Gonja people|Gonja]], Dagbon, and among some of the Kumasi Muslims, excluding the Hausas and other Muslims of [[Nigerian]] origin. And His great grandson Shiek Alhaj Baba Suwari of Wenchi in Ghana also contributed to massive spread of Islam in the sub-region.

The [[Jakhanke people]] also trace their spiritual ancestry to al-Hajj Salim Suwari, and since they believed that the spirits of dead saints kept guard over their followers and interceded for them before Allah, the graves of al-Hajj Salim and other great teachers were centers for pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I3mVUEzm8xMC&amp;pg=PA414&amp;lpg=PA414&amp;dq=%22salim+suwari%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0Vv_Y4AhlP&amp;sig=9lpV2MzSynm8m6eKqGv1Zpa37lY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kY4uSpP3MYyItAO4pdnCCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#PPA415,M1 A History of Islamic Societies]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert Caraco''' (8 July 1919 – 7 September 1971) was a [[French Uruguayan|French-Uruguayan]] philosopher, writer, essayist and poet of [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Turkish Jewish]] descent. He is known for his two major works, ''Post Mortem'' (1968) and [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously published]] ''Bréviaire du chaos'' (1982). He is often compared to the philosophers and writers such as [[Emil Cioran]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Nicolás Gómez Dávila]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref name="illusion"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1818603.Breviario_del_caos | title=Breviario del caos | accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Albert Caraco was born [[Istanbul]] on 8 July 1919 to a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name="chaos"&gt;{{cite book | title=Le Bréviaire du Chaos | publisher=L'Age d'Homme | author=Caraco, Albert | year=1982 | location=Lausanne | isbn=2825109894}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family relocated in Vienna, Prague and later in Berlin, before settling in Paris. He attended to [[Lycée Janson de Sailly]] and graduated from [[EDHEC Business School (Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales du Nord)|Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="illusion"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://illusioncity.net/albert-caraco/ | title=Albert Caraco biography | publisher=illusioncity.net | date=17 June 2012 | accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same year, Caraco and his family fled to South America due to [[Nazi]] threat and approaching [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="chaos"/&gt; His family received  Uruguayan citizenship and converted to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="bio-fr"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://albertcaraco.free.fr/ | title=Albert Caraco | accessdate=29 May 2014 |language= French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1940s, Caraco published a series of poems and plays.&lt;ref name="illusion"/&gt;

In 1946, Caraco returned to Paris, where he spent the rest of his life. Inspired by [[Monasticism|monastic discipline]], he devoted himself to writing, although he renounced his Catholic faith.&lt;ref name="bio-fr"/&gt; His mother's death in 1969, which was widely documented in his work, ''Post mortem'', had a negative effect on his state. On 7 September 1971, following his father's death, he committed suicide. Most of his unreleased works were posthumously published by L'Age d'Homme publishing company.&lt;ref name="bio-fr"/&gt;

An article regarding Caraco's works and life, written by [[Louis Nucéra]], was published on 4 May 1984 in ''[[Le Monde]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://albertcaraco.free.fr/agoniesdunreprouve.htm | title=Les agonies d'un réprouvé | publisher=[[Le Monde]] | date=4 May 1984 | author=Nucéra, Louis |language= French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ali Hujwiri was born in [[Ghazni]], in present-day [[Afghanistan]], in around 1009 to Uthman ibn Ali or Bu Ali. He is a direct descendant of Prophet [[Muhammad]] through his father who was a direct descendant of Al-Imam [[Hasan ibn Ali]]. His genealogical chain goes back eight generations to [[Ali]].&lt;ref&gt; Hasan, Masudul, ''Hazrat Data Ganj Bakhsh: a spiritual biographyʾ'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alī al-Hujwīrī, ''Kashf al-maḥjūb'', trans. Reynold A. Nicholson, Leiden 1911, intro&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the autobiographical information recorded in his own ''Kashf al-maḥjūb'', it is evident that Ali Hujwiri travelled "widely through the [[Ghaznavid Empire]] and beyond, spending considerable time in [[Baghdad]], [[Nishapur]], and [[Damascus]], where he met many of the pre-eminent Ṣūfīs of his time."&lt;ref&gt;Strothmann, Linus, "Dātā Ganj Bakhsh, Shrine of", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson; see also ʿAlī al-Hujwīrī, ''Kashf al-maḥjūb'', trans. Reynold A. Nicholson, Leiden 1911, intro.&lt;/ref&gt; In matters of [[fiqh|jurisprudence]], he received training in the [[Hanafi]] [[maddhab|rite]] of [[maddhab|orthodox Sunni law]] under various teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Strothmann, Linus, "Dātā Ganj Bakhsh, Shrine of", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson; see also ʿAlī al-Hujwīrī, ''Kashf al-maḥjūb'', trans. Reynold A. Nicholson, Leiden 1911, intro.&lt;/ref&gt; As for his [[tasawwuf|Sufic]] training, he was linked through his teacher al-Khuttalī to al-Husrī, [[Abu Bakr Shibli]] (d. 946), and [[Junayd of Baghdad]] (d. 910).&lt;ref&gt;Alexander D. Knysh, ''Islamic mysticism. A short history'' (Leiden 2000), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; For a short period of time, the mystic is believed to have lived in [[Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;Hosain, Hidayet and Massé, H., "Hud̲j̲wīrī", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P.

Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P.

Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs&lt;/ref&gt; His last few years, however, were not free of struggle, as he was imprisoned for some time for "the lack of the books he had left at [[Ghazni]]."&lt;ref&gt;Hosain, Hidayet and Massé, H., "Hud̲j̲wīrī", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P.

===Companions of Muḥammad===
====Abu Bakr====
Ali Hujwiri described the [[Rashidun caliphate|first caliph of Islam]] [[Abu Bakr]] (d. 634) as "the Greatest Truthful,"&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; and deemed him "the leader (''imām'') of all the folk of this [[Sufism|Path]]."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Eulogizing Abu Bakr's piety, Ali Hujwiri praised him for how "he gave away all his wealth and his clients, and clad himself in a woolen garment, and came to the Messenger Muhammad "&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 32 (trans. slightly altered)&lt;/ref&gt; and stated elsewhere that he "is placed by the Sufi shaykhs at the head of those who have adopted the contemplative life."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; In conclusion, Ali Hujwiri stated: "The whole sect of Sufis have made him their patron in stripping themselves of worldly things, in fixity, in eager desire for poverty, and in longing to renounce authority. He is the leader of the Muslims in general, and of the Sufis in particular."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

====Umar====
Ali Hujwiri described the [[Rashidun caliphate|second caliph of Islam]] [[Umar]] (d. 644) as one "specially distinguished by sagacity and resolution,"&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; and said that "the Sufis make him their model in wearing a patched garment and rigorously performing the duties of religion."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He further praised Umar for his "very exalted station" in combining a life of worldly duties with intense and consistent spiritual devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;
====Uthman====
Regarding the third of the  [[Rashidun caliphate|Rightly-Guided Caliphs]] of the early Islamic community, [[Uthman]] (d. 656), Ali Hujwiri stated that the "Sufis take Uthman as their exemplar in sacrificing life and property, in resigning their affairs to God, and in sincere devotion."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ali====
With respect to the [[Rashidun caliphate|fourth of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs of Islam]], [[Ali]] (d. 661), Ali Hujwiri stated: "His renown and rank in this [[Sufism|Path]] were very high. He explained the principles of Divine Truth with exceeding subtlety.... Ali is a model for the Sufis in respect to the truths of outward expressions and the subtleties of inward meanings, the stripping of one's self of all property either of this world or of the next, and consideration of the Divine Providence."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; He also approvingly cited [[Junayd of Baghdad]]'s saying: "Ali is our Shaykh as regards the principles and as regards the endurance of affliction."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dancing===
According to Ali Hujwiri, purely secular [[dancing]] "has no foundation either in the religious law of Islam or in the path of Sufism, because all reasonable men agree that it is a diversion when it is in earnest, and an impropriety when it is in jest."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he censured "all the traditions cited in its favour" as "worthless."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; As for the legitimate ecstatic experiences of some Sufis, whose bodies convulsed when their "heart [throbbed] with exhilaration and rapture" on account of their intense [[love of God]],&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Hujwiri declared that these movements only outwardly resembled dancing and opined that "those who call it 'dancing' are utterly wrong. It is a state that cannot be explained in words: 'without experience no knowledge.'"&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctors of law===
====Abu Hanifa====
Regarding [[Abu Hanifa]] (d. 772), the traditionally recognized founder of the [[Hanafi]] [[maddhab|school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence]], Ali Hujwiri stated: "He is the Imām of Imāms (lit. 'Leader of Leaders') and the exemplar of the [[Sunni]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;
====Ahmad ibn Hanbal====
Regarding [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] (d. 855), the traditionally recognized founder of the [[Hanbali]] [[maddhab|school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence]], Ali Hujwiri stated: "He was distinguished by devoutness and piety, and was the guardian of the Traditions of the Messenger. Sufis of all sects regard him as blessed. He associated with great shaykhs ... his miracles were manifest and his intelligence sound. The doctrines attributed to him today by certain [[anthropomorphist]]s are inventions and forgeries; he is to be acquitted of all notions of that sort. He had a firm belief in the principles of religion, and his creed was approved by all the theologians.... He is clear of all [the slander] that is alleged against him."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), pp. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family of Muḥammad===
====Hasan====
Regarding the grandson of [[Muhammad]] and son of [[Ali]], [[Hasan ibn Ali]] (d. 670), Ali Hujwiri described him as one "profoundly versed in [spiritual truths]" and as one of "the true saints and shaykhs" of the Islamic community.&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
====Husayn====
With respect to the younger grandson of [[Muhammad]] and son of [[Ali]], [[Husayn ibn Ali]] (d. 680), Ali Hujwiri emphatically declared: "He is the martyr of [[Karbala]] and all Sufis are agreed that he was in the right. So long as the Truth was apparent, he followed it; but when it was lost he drew the sword and never rested until he sacrificed his dear life for God's sake."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;
====Jafar al-Sadiq====
Ali Hujwiri described [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] (d. 765), the great-grandson of [[Husayn]], as one "celebrated among the Sufi shaykhs for the subtlety of discourse and his acquaintance with spiritual truths."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;
====Muhammad al-Baqir====
Regarding the grandson of [[Husayn]], [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] (d. 733), Ali Hujwiri stated: "He was distinguished for his knowledge of the abstruse science and for his subtle indications as to the meaning of the [[Quran]]."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;
====Zayn al-Abidin====
Ali Hujwiri praised [[Zayn al-Abidin]] (d. 713), the son of [[Husayn]], for being of "the character of those who have attained perfect rectitude."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law and jurisprudence===
As a [[Sunni Muslim]], Ali Hujwiri believed it was a spiritual necessity to follow one of the [[maddhab|orthodox schools of religious law]], being himself a staunch follower of the [[Hanafi]] [[maddhab|school]] of [[maddhab|orthodox Sunni jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;Hosain, Hidayet and Massé, H., "Hud̲j̲wīrī", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs: "Although he was a Sunni and a Hanafi...".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strothmann, Linus, "Dātā Ganj Bakhsh, Shrine of", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson: "Al-Hujwīrī followed the Ḥanafī school and is connected through his teacher, al-Khuttalī, to al-Husrī, al-Shiblī (d. 334/945), and al-Junayd (d. 297/910) of Baghdad (Knysh, 133)."&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Ali Hujwiri condemned as "heretics" all those who espoused mystical doctrines without following all the precepts of the [[Shariah|religious law]] (''sharīʿah'').&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; He further denounced all those "who held that ... when the Truth is revealed the Law is abolished."&lt;ref&gt;Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; For Ali Hujwiri, then, all true and orthodox mystical activity needed to take place within the boundaries of the religious law.&lt;ref&gt;See Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry===
Ali Hujwiri deemed it lawful to listen to virtuous [[poetry]], saying: "It is permissible to hear poetry. The [[Muhammad|Messenger]] heard it, and the [[Sahaba|Companions]] not only heard it but also spoke it."&lt;ref&gt;See Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these reasons, he censured those who "declare that it is unlawful to listen to any poetry whatever, and pass their lives in defaming their brother Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;See Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the hearing of secular poetry, however, Ali Hujwiri's opinion was far stricter, and he deemed it "unlawful" to hear poetry or love-songs that enticed the hearer to [[carnal]] desires through detailed descriptions "of the face and hair and mole of the beloved."&lt;ref&gt;See Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 398&lt;/ref&gt; In conclusion, he stated that those who regarded the hearing of such poetry "as absolutely lawful must also regard looking and touching as lawful, which is infidelity and heresy."&lt;ref&gt;See Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 398&lt;/ref&gt;
===Saints===
Ali Hujwiri supported the orthodox belief in the existence of [[wali|saints]].&lt;ref&gt;See Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he stated: "You must know that the principle and foundation of Sufism and Knowledge of God rests on sainthood, the reality of which is unanimously affirmed by all the teachers, though every one has expressed himself in a different language."&lt;ref&gt;See Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, he said: "God has saints whom He has specially distinguished by His Friendship and whom He has chosen to be the governors of His Kingdom and has marked out to manifest by His Actions and has peculiarly favored with diverse kinds of miracles and has purged of natural corruptions and has delivered from subjection to their lower soul and passion, so that all their thoughts are of Him and their intimacy is with Him alone. Such have been in past ages, and are now, and shall be hereafter until the [[Day of Resurrection]], because God exalted this community above all others and has promised to preserve the religion of Muhammad.... The visible proof [of [[Islam]]] is to be found among the saints and the elect of God." &lt;ref&gt;See Hujwiri, ''Kashf al-Mahjub'', trans. R. A. Nicholson (Lahore: Sang-e-Meel Publications, 2007), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
===''Kashf al-maḥjūb''===
{{main article|Kashf ul Mahjoob}}
Ali Hujwiri is perhaps most famous for writing what has been described as "the earliest formal treatise on Ṣūfism in Persian,"&lt;ref&gt;Strothmann, Linus, "Dātā Ganj Bakhsh, Shrine of", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson.&lt;/ref&gt; the renowned ''[[Kashf ul Mahjoob|Kashf al-maḥjūb]]'' (''[[Kashf ul Mahjoob|Unveiling of the Hidden]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Strothmann, Linus, "Dātā Ganj Bakhsh, Shrine of", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson.&lt;/ref&gt; The work presents itself as an introduction to the various aspects of orthodox Sufism, and also provides biographies of the greatest saints of the Islamic community.&lt;ref&gt;Strothmann, Linus, "Dātā Ganj Bakhsh, Shrine of", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Kashf al-maḥjūb'' is the only work of Ali Hujwiri that has remained until today.&lt;ref&gt;Hosain, Hidayet and Massé, H., “Hud̲j̲wīrī”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5408">'''Alice Ambrose Lazerowitz''' (November 25, 1906&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; January 25, 2001) was an [[American philosopher]], logician, and author.

==Early life and education==
Alice Loman Ambrose was born in [[Lexington, Illinois]] and orphaned when she was 13 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shook|first=John R.|title=Dictionary of modern American philosophers|year=2005|publisher=Thoemmes|location=Bristol|isbn=1843710374}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied philosophy and mathematics at [[Millikin University]] (1924–28).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Ambrose Lazerowitz|url=http://sophia.smith.edu/blog/smithipedia/faculty-staff/lazerowitz-alice-ambrose/|work=Smithpedia|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing her PhD at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1932, she went to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] ([[Newnham College]]) to study with [[G. E. Moore]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], where she earned a second PhD in 1938.

==Wittgenstein==
Having become a close disciple of Wittgenstein, Ambrose later related her association with him in ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: Philosophy and Language'' (1972), a volume co-edited with her husband [[Morris Lazerowitz]]. Along with fellow student [[Margaret MacDonald (philosopher)|Margaret MacDonald]] she secretly (since he did not allow this) made notes during Wittgenstein's lectures, which were later published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambrose|first=Alice|title=Wittgenstein's lectures : Cambridge, 1932-1935; from the notes of Alice Ambrose and Margaret Macdonald|year=1979|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631101411}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of a select group of students to whom Wittgenstein dictated the so-called [[Blue and Brown Books]], which outline the transition in Wittgenstein's thought between his two major works, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' and ''Philosophical Investigations''. Wittgenstein terminated their association abruptly in 1935 when Ambrose decided, with encouragement from G.E.Moore, to publish an article entitled "Finitism in Mathematics" in the philosophical journal ''Mind''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ambrose|first=Alice|title=Finitism in Mathematics|journal=Mind|year=1935|volume=44|issue=174|pages=186–203|doi=10.1093/mind/XLIV.174.186}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was intended to give an account of Wittgenstein's position on the subject.

==Career==
Ambrose began her career at the University of Michigan when she returned to the United States in 1935. She then took a position in [[Smith College]] in 1937, where she remained for the rest of her career. She was awarded the Austin and Sophia Smith chair in Philosophy in 1964 and became Professor Emeritus in 1972. From 1953-68 she was editor of the ''[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]''. 
She worked chiefly in logic and mathematical philosophy, writing a primer on the subject with her husband which became a widely used textbook and was known as "Ambrose and Lazerowitz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambrose|first=Alice|title=Fundamentals of Symbolic Logic|year=1948|publisher=Rinehart}}&lt;/ref&gt; She collaborated with her husband on a number of works: ''Fundamentals of Symbolic Logic'' (1948), ''Logic: The Theory of Formal Inference'' (1961), ''Philosophical Theories'' (1976) and ''Essays in the Unknown Wittgenstein'' (1984). Even after her retirement she continued to teach and guest lecture at Smith and other universities around the country until her death, at the age of 94, on January 25, 2001.

Her personal papers are held at Smith College Archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Ambrose Lazerowitz Papers|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/smitharchives/manosca101.html|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ārjava''' (Sanskrit: आर्जव) literally means sincerity, straightness and non-hypocrisy.&lt;ref name=jsinha&gt;J Sinha, {{Google books|VCwmmWXJBqEC|Indian Psychology|page=142}}, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidas, {{oclc|1211693}}, page 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+arjava&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Arjava] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the ten [[Yamas]] in ancient Hindu and Jaina texts.&lt;ref name="KN Aiyar 1914 pages 173-176"&gt;KN Aiyar (1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, Kessinger Publishing, {{ISBN|978-1164026419}}, Chapter 22, pages 173-176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
''Ārjava'' means straightness, sincerity and harmony in one’s thought, words and actions towards oneself and towards others.&lt;ref name=jsinha/&gt; [[Pandurang Vaman Kane|Kane]] translates ''arjava'' as straightforwardness.&lt;ref&gt;PV Kane (1974), History of Dharmaśāstra: (ancient and Mediæval Religious and Civil Law in India), Vol 2, Issue 1, {{oclc|134943}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is explained in ancient Indian texts as “self-restraint from hypocrisy", and "the absence of hypocrisy”. It is included as one of several ethical virtuous restraints in an individual's path to spirituality. The Maharashtrian poet Vāmana in Avigita, at xvi.1, posits ''arjava'' is a form of honesty and purity in a person, and an essential virtue so that one may treat everyone equally, whether that other is one’s child, wife, relative, friend, a stranger, someone hostile or oneself without any discrimination.&lt;ref name=jsinha/&gt;

The ethical concept of ''Arjava'' is synonymously referred to as ''Adambha'' (अदम्भ, composite word from अ+दम्भ). Adambha also means&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=adambha+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Adambha] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; non-deceitful, straightforwardness and sincerity. It is listed as a virtue in the Indian Epics.&lt;ref name=ianp/&gt;

==Literature==
Arjava is one of the ten yamas listed by [[Shandilya Upanishad|Śāṇḍilya Upanishad]],&lt;ref name="KN Aiyar 1914 pages 173-176"/&gt; as well as by Svātmārāma.&lt;ref name=svatmaram&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hatha Yoga Pradipika|author=Svātmārāma|author2=Pancham Sinh |publisher = Forgotten Books|edition= 5|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sBFttVx6ukC|ISBN= 9781605066370|page=14|quote=&lt;br&gt;Quote - अथ यम-नियमाः&lt;br&gt; अहिंसा सत्यमस्तेयं बरह्यछर्यम कश्हमा धृतिः &lt;br&gt; दयार्जवं मिताहारः शौछम छैव यमा दश}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorenzen|first1=David|title=The Kāpālikas and Kālāmukhas|date=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520018426|pages=186–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merging with Śiva: Hinduism's contemporary metaphysics |last= Subramuniya |publisher= Himalayan Academy Publications|year= 2003|location= |isbn= 9780945497998 |page=155 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JupkNVxfwHgC |accessdate=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the virtuous restraints (yamas) taught in ancient Indian texts. The other nine [[yamas]] are [[Ahiṃsā]] (अहिंसा): Nonviolence, [[Satya]] (सत्य): truthfulness, [[Asteya]] (अस्तेय): not stealing, [[Brahmacharya]] (ब्रह्मचर्य): celibacy and not cheating on one’s spouse, [[Forgiveness#Hinduism|Kṣamā]] (क्षमा): forgiveness,&lt;ref name=ss&gt;Stuart Sovatsky (1998), Words from the Soul: Time East/West Spirituality and Psychotherapeutic Narrative, State University of New York, {{ISBN|978-0791439494}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dhrti|Dhṛti]] (धृति): fortitude, [[Compassion#Hinduism|Dayā]] (दया): compassion,&lt;ref name=ss/&gt; [[Mitahara|Mitāhāra]] (मितहार): measured diet, and [[Shaucha|Śauca]] (शौच): purity, cleanliness.

In some texts, such as by [[Adi Sankara]], this virtue is called as ''bhavasamsuddhi'', and explained as purity of motive and freedom of mind from hypocrisy, both in one’s social conduct, as well as within oneself where one’s thoughts, words and actions resonate.&lt;ref name=jsinha/&gt; It is considered as a virtue that empowers one to act and live without anxiety, anger, prejudice, inner conflict or confusion. It is also discussed in [[Bhagwad Gita]] in verse 17.16.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple (2009), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438428420}}, page 649&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahabharata, in Book 12 Chapter 60, lists ''Adambha'' (non-hypocrisy) as a virtue along with ''Akrodha'' (non-anger), ''Kshama'' (forgiveness) and others.&lt;ref name=ianp&gt;Ian Proudfoot, Ahiṃsā and a Mahābhārata Story, Faculty of Asian Studies, Australian National University, {{ISBN|978-0731501434}}, page 185&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, in Chapter 278, the Epic explains how and why hypocrisy arises, suggesting that it is a derivative of the sin of covetousness, greed and attachment to superficial possessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b100.htm Shanti Parva] The Mahabharata, Section CCLXXIII, KM Ganguli (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt; Patanjali's treatise on Yoga lists only five [[yamas]], which includes non-covetousness and non-possessiveness (''Asteya'' and ''Aparigraha'' respectively), but does not include ''Arjava''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Woods | first =James Haughton (translator) | year =2003 | title = The yoga-system of Patañjali; or, The ancient Hindu doctrine of concentration of mind | url=https://archive.org/details/yogasystemofpata00wooduoft|publisher =Courier Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-43200-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5516">'''The Book of the Secret Supper''' (''Cena Secreta''), also known as '''''Interrogatio Iohannis''''' (''The Questions of John''), '''''The Book of John the Evangelist''''' and '''''The Gospel of the Secret Supper'''''.

''The Book of the Secret Supper'' was an important [[Catharism|Cathar]] scripture. Originally a [[Bogomilism|Bogomil]] [[Apocrypha|apocryphal text]] from [[Bulgaria]], possibly based on a now lost [[Paulicianism|Paulican]] treatise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last= Barnstone|editor1-first= Willis|editor2-last= Meyer|editor2-first= Marvin|date= 2003|title= The Gnostic Bible|url= |location= Boston|publisher= Shambala|page= 740|isbn= 978-1590306314|editor1-link= Willis Barnstone| editor2-link= Marvin Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Book of the Secret Supper'' was translated into [[Latin]] and introduced to [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] in the late 12th century, then taken to [[Provence]] before the [[Albigensian Crusade]] by the Cathar [[bishop]] Nazarials or Nazario.

Two manuscripts survive; one was found in the archives of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] in the [[France in the Middle Ages|French]] town of [[Carcassonne]] in [[Languedoc]], a Cathar stronghold, and the other was kept in the National Library of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. There are significant differences between the two texts indicating independent manuscript traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://gnosis.org/library/Interrogatio_Johannis.html|title= Interrogatio Johannis|last= Owens|first= Lance S.|website= The Gnostic Society Library - Cathar Texts and Rituals|publisher= The Gnostic Society Library|access-date= December 1, 2018|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A postscript added to the Carcassonne manuscript by the Inquisitors states, "This is the Secret of the heretics of Concorrezzo, brought from Bulgaria by Nazarials, their bishop. It is full of errors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1-last= Wakefield |author1-first= Walter L. | author2-last= Evans |author2-first= Austin P. |date= 1991|title= Heresies of the High Middle Ages |url= |location= New York|publisher= Columbia Univ. Press |page= 458|isbn= 978-0231096324 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
''The Book of the Secret Supper'' is a [[first-person narrative]] beginning "I, John…" in which [[John the Evangelist]] poses a series of questions to [[Jesus]] at a secret supper in the [[Kingdom of Heaven (Gospel of Matthew)|kingdom of heaven]]. 

===Creation===
The book begins with the story of the [[Dualistic cosmology#Gnosticism|opposing forces]] of the [[God in Christianity|Invisible Father]], the creator of good, and [[Devil in Christianity|Satan]], the creator of evil, who shines white before his fall and burns red after.

Jesus tells John how Satan took over the world, descending from the [[third heaven]] and recruiting [[Christian angelology|angels]] to join him “according to the plan of the Governor Most High.” Satan brought forth all living things, plants, animals, fish and birds, then created man and woman from clay, animating the man with an angel from the second heaven and the woman with an angel from the first heaven. The angels were distressed at having to inhabit material forms. Satan encouraged them to [[Christian views on sin|sin]], but they did not know how. Satan filled the woman with a longing for sin, then took the form of a serpent and seduced her. He then filled Adam with lust for debauchery with the result that all their children were offspring of the devil and of the serpent.

===Nativity===
Jesus then describes his own birth, telling John that the Father sent an angel, in the form of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], to receive Him in the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]. Jesus descended from the [[Seven Heavens|seventh heaven]] and came forth from her ear. Satan then sent [[Elijah]] in the form of [[John the Baptist]] to give a false [[baptism]] by water, but John is warned that only baptism in spirit by Jesus can bring about the [[Absolution|remission of sin]]. Those baptized with water marry, but those baptized in the spirit remain celibate.

===Last Judgement===
The final part of the book is a description of the [[Last Judgement]] when those who have followed an angelic life shall be honored, while those who lived a life of iniquity shall find wrath, fury and distress in everlasting fire. Satan, after waging war upon the just, will be bound with unbreakable bonds and cast into a pool of fire. Then the Son of God will sit on the right hand of his Father, the righteous will be set among the choirs of angels, God shall be in the midst of them and wipe away their tears, and of His kingdom there shall be no end for ever and ever.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7827">'''Clinical equipoise''', also known as the '''principle of equipoise''', provides the ethical basis for medical research that involves assigning patients to different treatment arms of a [[clinical trial]]. The term was first used by Benjamin Freedman in 1987.&lt;ref name="Freedman"&gt;Freedman, B. (1987) 'Equipoise and the ethics of clinical research'. ''The New England Journal of Medicine'', 317, (3):141–145.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, clinical equipoise means that there is genuine uncertainty in the expert medical community over whether a treatment will be beneficial. This applies also for off-label treatments performed before or during their required clinical trials.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

An ethical dilemma arises in a clinical trial when the investigator(s) begin to believe that the treatment or intervention administered in one arm of the trial is significantly outperforming the other arms. A trial should begin with a [[null hypothesis]], and there should exist no decisive [[Empirical evidence|evidence]] that the intervention or drug being tested will be superior to existing treatments or effective at all. As the trial progresses, the findings may provide sufficient evidence to convince the investigator of the intervention or drug’s efficacy. Once a certain threshold of evidence is passed, there is no longer genuine uncertainty about the most beneficial treatment, so there is an ethical imperative for the investigator to provide the superior intervention to all participants. Ethicists contest the location of this evidentiary threshold, with some suggesting that investigators should only continue the study until they are convinced that one of the treatments is better, and with others arguing that the study should continue until the evidence convinces the entire expert medical community.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The extent to which major research ethics policies endorse clinical equipoise varies. For instance, the Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pre.ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique/initiatives/tcps2-eptc2/Default/|title=Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans|last=TCPS2|first=|date=|website=Panel of Research Ethics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; endorses it; whereas, the [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use]] (ICH) does not. With regard to clinical equipoise in practice, there is evidence that industry-funded studies disproportionately favor the industry product, suggesting unfavorable conditions for clinical equipoise. In contrast, a series of studies of national cancer institute funded trials suggests an outcome pattern consistent with clinical equipoise.&lt;ref&gt;Djulbegovic, B. (2009) The Paradox of Equipoise: The Principle That Drives and Limits Therapeutic Discoveries in Clinical Research. ''Cancer Control'', 16, (4): 342–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Shaw and Chalmers argued early on that "If the clinician knows, or has good reason to believe, that a new therapy (A) is better than another therapy (B), he cannot participate in a comparative trial of Therapy A versus Therapy B. Ethically, the clinician is obligated to give Therapy A to each new patient with a need for one of these therapies."&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;Shaw, L., A.M. &amp; T. Chalmers, M.D. (1970) 'Ethics in Cooperative Clinical Trials'. ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 169, 487–495.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers would thus face an ethical dilemma if they wanted to continue the study and collect more evidence, but had compelling evidence that one of the tested therapies was superior. They further stated that any results should be withheld from the researchers during the trial until completion to avoid this ethical dilemma and ensure the study’s completion.

This method proved to be difficult in modern research, where many clinical trials have to be performed and analyzed by experts in that field.  Freedman proposed a different approach to this ethical dilemma called '''clinical equipoise'''.  Clinical equipoise occurs "if there is genuine uncertainty within the expert medical community&amp;nbsp;— not necessarily on the part of the individual investigator&amp;nbsp;— about the preferred treatment."&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt; Clinical equipoise is distinguished from '''theoretical equipoise''', which requires evidence on behalf of the alternative treatments to be exactly balanced and thus yields a very fragile epistemic threshold for favoring one treatment over the other. Theoretical equipoise could be disturbed, for example, by something as simple as anecdotal evidence or a hunch on the part of the investigator. Clinical equipoise allows investigators to continue a trial until they have enough statistical evidence to convince other experts of the validity of their results, without a loss of ethical integrity on the part of the investigators.

Equipoise is also an important consideration in the design of a trial from a patient’s perspective. This is especially true in [[randomized controlled trials]] (RCTs) for [[surgical]] interventions, where both trial and control arms are likely to have their own associated risks and hopes for benefits. The condition of the patient is also a factor in these risks. Ensuring that trials meet the standards of clinical equipoise is an important part of patient recruitment in this regard; it is likely that past trials that did not meet conditions of clinical equipoise suffered from poor recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Lilford, R. et al. 'Trials in surgery', ''British Journal of Surgery'', (2004), 91, 6–16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Miller and Brody argue that the notion of clinical equipoise is fundamentally misguided. The ethics of therapy and the ethics of research are two distinct enterprises that are governed by different norms. They state, “The doctrine of clinical equipoise is intended to act as a bridge between therapy and research, allegedly making it possible to conduct RCTs without sacrificing the therapeutic obligation of physicians to provide treatment according to a scientifically validated standard of care. This constitutes [[therapeutic misconception]] concerning the ethics of clinical trials, analogous to the tendency of patient volunteers to confuse treatment in the context of RCTs with routine medical care.”&lt;ref&gt;Miller, F. G. and H. Brody. 'A Critique of Clinical Equipoise: Therapeutic Misconception in the Ethics of Clinical Trials', ''The Hastings Center Report'', (2003), 33, (3): 19–28&lt;/ref&gt; Equipoise, they argue, only makes sense as a normative assumption for clinical trials if one assumes that researchers have therapeutic obligations to their research participants. 
Further criticisms of clinical equipoise have been leveled by Robert Veatch&lt;ref&gt;Veatch, R. ‘The Irrelevance of Equipoise’, ''Journal of Medical Philosophy'', (2007), 32, (2): 167–183&lt;/ref&gt; and by Peter Ubel and Robert Silbergleit.&lt;ref&gt;Ubel, P. and Robert Silbergleit .‘Behavioral Equipoise: A Way to Resolve Ethical Stalemates in Clinical Research’, ''The American Journal of Bioethics'', (2011), 11, (2): 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dennis Vincent Brutus''' (28 November 1924&amp;nbsp;– 26 December 2009) was a [[South Africa]]n activist, educator, journalist and poet best known for his campaign to have South Africa banned from the [[Olympic Games]] due to its controversial racial policy of [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/dennis-brutus | title = Dennis Brutus South Africa Online | accessdate = 2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Born in [[Salisbury (Rhodesia)|Salisbury]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] to South African parents, Brutus was of indigenous Khoi, Dutch, French, English, German and Malaysian ancestry. His parents moved back home to [[Port Elizabeth]] when he was aged four, and young Brutus was classified under [[South Africa]]'s [[apartheid]] racial code as "coloured".&lt;ref name="DBT01"&gt;[https://books.google.lu/books?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC "The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography"], ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt;

Brutus was a graduate of the [[University of Fort Hare]] (BA, 1946) and of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], where he studied law. He taught English and [[Afrikaans]] at several high schools in South Africa after 1948, but was eventually dismissed for his vocal criticism of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith A. P.

===Activist===
Brutus was an activist against the apartheid government of South Africa in the 1960s. He learned politics in the [[Trotsky]]ist movement of the Eastern Cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dennis+Brutus:+a+memorial+statement.-a0219588353|title=Dennis Brutus: a memorial statement. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not an accomplished athlete in his own right, he was motivated by the unfairness of selections for athletic teams. He joined the Anti-Coloured Affairs Department organisation (Anti-CAD), a Trotskyist group that organised against the Coloured Affairs Department, which was an attempt by the government to institutionalise divisions between [[Black people|blacks]] and [[coloureds]].

Brutus was a co-founder of the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC), an organization that would be heavily influential in the banning of [[Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics]] in 1964. In 1961, Brutus was banned for his political activities as part of SANROC.  As South Africa attempted, in 1968, to get back into the Olympics by arguing that they would field multi-racial teams, SANROC successfully pointed out that those teams were chosen on a segregated basis, leading to South Africa's continued ban from 1968 until 1992.&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"&gt;George Houser, ''No One Can Stop the Rain: Glimpses of Africa's Freedom Struggle''(New York: Pilgrim Press, 1989), 273-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and jail===
In 1963, Brutus was arrested for trying to meet with an International Olympic Committee (IOC) official; he was accused of breaking the terms of his "banning," which were that he could not meet with more than two people outside his family, and he was sentenced to 18 months in jail. However, he "jumped bail" by trying to leave South Africa to attend the IOC meeting in Baden-Baden, West Germany, on behalf of SANROC and while in [[Mozambique]], on a Rhodesian passport, the Portuguese secret police arrested him and returned him to South Africa. There, while trying to escape, he was shot in the back at point-blank range. After only partly recovering from the wound, Brutus was sent to [[Robben Island]] ... for 16 months, five in solitary." He was in the cell next to [[Nelson Mandela]]'s. Brutus was in prison when news of the country's suspension from the 1964 [[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympics]], for which he had campaigned, broke.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"/&gt;

Brutus was forbidden to teach, write and publish in South Africa. His first collection of poetry, ''Sirens, Knuckles and Boots'', was published in [[Nigeria]] while he was in prison. The book received the [[The Mbari Club|Mbari Poetry Prize]], awarded to a black poet of distinction, but Brutus turned it down on the grounds of its racial exclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;Josh MacPhee, [https://justseeds.org/242-mbari-publishing/ "242: Mbari Publishing"], ''Justseeds'', 20 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Brutus, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Mbari+prize+&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xc8hf72JPU&amp;sig=CCSXqnTGthL_lRgo6ZrdD9jM1Lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6qtWyhZbXAhUIY1AKHeVyC_UQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mbari%20prize%20&amp;f=false ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''] (edited by Bernth Lindfors), James Currey, 2011, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of 14 books.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;

===Release from jail===
After he was released, in 1965, Brutus left South Africa on an exit permit, which meant he could never return home while the apartheid regime stayed in power. He went into exile in the  [[United Kingdom|Britain]],where he first met [[George Houser]], the Executive Director of the [[American Committee on Africa]] (ACOA).  South Africa made a concerted effort to get reinstated to the Olympic Games in Mexico City in 1968. Its Prime Minister John Vorster outlined a new policy of fielding a multi-racial team.  At first the IOC accepted this new policy and was going to allow South Africa to compete, but SANROC pointed out that there would be no mixed sporting events within South Africa and therefore all South African athletes chosen for the Games would be chosen under a segregated framework. In 1967, Brutus came to the United States under the auspices of the ACOA on a speaking tour; where he acquainted Americans more closely with the present situation in South Africa, informed American sports organizations about the segregated conditions that South African athletes must endure, and raised money to support the ACOA's Africa Defense and Aid Fund to support the defense of those charged under the apartheid laws.  The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa  which represented the independent African nations at the IOC threatened to boycott if South Africa was included in the 1968 Games.  In cooperation with SANROC, the ACOA organized a boycott of American athletes in February 1968.  [[Jackie Robinson]], the first African American athlete to break to color barrier in [[Major League Baseball]], published a statement calling for continued suspension of South Africa from the Olympic Games. Asa result of the international pressure, the IOC relented and kept South Africa out of the Olympic Games from 1968 until 1992.&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACOA, "Announcing Dennis Brutus," found at: http://africanactivist.msu.edu/document_metadata.php?objectid=32-130-B92 [accessed on 27 October 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACOA, "Statement by Jackie Robinson and K.C.

In 1983, Brutus won the right to stay in the [[United States]] as a political refugee, after a protracted legal struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley Clendenin, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/14/us/black-poet-an-exile-for-10-years-battles-us-deportation-to-africa.html "Black poet, an exile for 10 years, battles U.S. Deportation to Africa"], ''The New York Times'', 14 January 1982.

===Return to South Africa, poetry and activism===
He returned to South Africa and was based at the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]], where he often contributed to the annual [[Poetry Africa]] Festival hosted by the university and supported activism against neo-liberal policies in contemporary South Africa through working with [[NGO]]s. 
In December 2007, Brutus was to be inducted into the South African Sports Hall of Fame. 
At the induction ceremony, he publicly turned down his nomination, stating: 

{{quote|It is incompatible to have those who championed racist sport alongside its genuine victims. It's time—indeed long past time—for sports truth, apologies and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Weekly'', 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

According to fellow writer [[Olu Oguibe]], interim Director of the Institute for African American Studies at the [[University of Connecticut]], "Brutus was arguably Africa's greatest and most influential modern poet after [[Leopold Sedar Senghor]] and [[Christopher Okigbo]], certainly the most widely-read, and no doubt among the world's finest poets of all time. More than that, he was a fearless campaigner for justice, a relentless organizer, an incorrigible romantic, and a great humanist and teacher."

Brutus died of [[prostate cancer]] on 26 December 2009, at his home in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref name=bond/&gt;&lt;ref name=demo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7edc02ba-f73d-11de-9fb5-00144feab49a.html |title=Poet, political prisoner and a campaigner to the end |publisher=www.ft.com|author= Martin, Jurek|date=2 January 2010&lt;!-- 02:00 --&gt;|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by two sisters, eight children including his son Anthony, nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;

In [[process theology]] '''dipolar theism''' is the position that in order to conceive a perfect God, one must conceive Him as embodying the "good" in sometimes-opposing characteristics, and therefore cannot be understood to embody only one set of characteristics.

For instance, here are some characteristics commonly associated with God:
:One — Many
:Transcendent — Immanent
:Eternal — Temporal
:Mutable — Immutable
:Merciful — Just
:Simple — Complex

Dipolar theism holds that in each pair, both of the characteristics contain some element of good.  In order to embody all perfections, therefore, God must embody the good in ''both'' characteristics, and cannot be limited to one, because a God limited to one would suffer the limits of the one, and lack the good in the other.

For instance, there is a "good" in being just, and also a good in being merciful.  In being just, God determines that the good are rewarded and the evil are punished.  In being merciful, God forgives those who sin.  It follows, therefore, that a God that was ''only'' just or ''only'' merciful would be less than perfect.  Dipolar theism holds that a perfect God must embody the good in ''both'' of those characteristics.  Thus, a perfect God has the "good" characteristics of justice ''and'' the good characteristics of mercy.

Alternatively, there is good in having absolute power, and good in leading by persuasion.  For a God to be perfect, he cannot rule solely by [[predestination]], because then he would lack the good possessed by a God who led by persuasion.  God must therefore embody the "good" in both power and persuasion. From this conclusion, some reject the existence of an [[omnipotent]] God.

==Critique of dipolar theism==
Those rejecting dipolar theism argue that it fails to distinguish between what we ''think'' God is and what God ''actually'' is.  Just because we think God should be a certain way in order to embody our idea of perfection does not mean he embodies those characteristics in reality.  

This critique is analogous to the critique of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]'s [[ontological argument]] by [[Gaunilo]]: "Just because I can imagine a perfect island does not mean that it actually exists.  Things are what they are no matter what I think they should be."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1323">The '''Epistle of Eugnostos''' is one of many [[Gnostic]] tractates from the [[Nag Hammadi library]], discovered in [[Egypt]] in 1945. The Nag Hammadi codices contain two full copies of this tractate. The [[epistle]] was a familiar literary convention of Antiquity; it is not to be supposed that this essay is an actual letter written by a man named ''Eugnostos'' ("right thinking", sometimes Eugnostus).

The text is devoid of any specifically Christian themes or associations, and simply describes the esoteric cosmology of the gnostics. The similarity with the cosmology in ''[[The Sophia of Jesus Christ|Sophia of Jesus Christ]]'' led [[Douglas M. Parrott]] to conclude that that work was an adaption of this Epistle for a Christian audience. Parrott places the two side by side for comparison  in his translation for ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English'', edited by Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;Parrott, Douglas, translation and introduction of "Eugnostos the Blessed" and "The Sophia of Jesus Christ" in ''The Nag Hammadi Library'', James Robinson, editor. 1990:220-243&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11170">'''Ernesto Buonaiuti''' (April 24, 1881 – April 20, 1946) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[historian]], [[philosopher]] of [[religion]], Catholic priest and anti-fascist. He lost his [[Chair (academic)|chair]] at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]] owing to his opposition to the [[Italian Fascism|Fascists]]. As a scholar in [[History of Christianity]] and religious philosophy he was one of the most important exponents of the [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|modernist]] current.

== Life ==
Buonaiuti was born in [[Rome]] on April 24, 1881. He was ordained priest on December 19, 1903, and began his studies working with the historian of religion [[Salvatore Minocchi]]. He made use of the [[Positivism (philosophy)|positive method]] in his study of [[History of Christianity#Early Christianity (c.33–325)|early Christianity]] in his book ''Il cristianesimo primitivo e la Politica imperiale romana'' ("Primitive Christianity and Roman Imperial Politics", 1911).

At the age of 24 he founded the magazine ''Rivista storico-critica delle scienze teologiche'' ("Historical-critical Review of the Theological Sciences"), in order to propagate his vision of religious culture in Italy, and after that he directed  the magazine ''Ricerche religiose'' ("Religious Researches"). Those magazines were soon banned by the church and placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'', the index of publications to be considered as forbidden to Catholic readers.

On January 25, 1925 he was punished with [[excommunication]], which was confirmed several times, because in his works he defended the ideas of the [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|modernist current]], particularly in ''Il programma dei modernisti'' ("The Modernists' Program", 1908) and ''Lettere di un prete modernista'' ("Letters from a Modernist Priest", 1908).

In his [[autobiography]] ''Il pellegrino di Roma'' ("The Pilgrim from Rome", 1945), Buonaiuti reconstructed the history of his conflict with the Catholic Church, of which he continued to claim himself a "loyal son", even after his excommunication.

From 1925 he was Professor of History of Christianity at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]]; however, after the [[Lateran treaty|Concordat]] in 1929, the University forbade him to teach and to examine students, and he was given non-academic tasks, such as library investigation and the writing of research papers. In 1931 his university chair was definitively revoked, because he refused to swear the "oath of loyalty" to Fascism (all teachers were forced by law to swear an oath of loyalty to the Fascist government, and those who refused were fired).

In 1945, after the Allied victory in the [[Second World War]] he was restored to his rank of university professor, but he was not allowed to give lectures, since, according to the [[bureaucracy]] and the laws resulting from the Concordat, which were retained by the new government, teaching in any Italian State University was forbidden to any excommunicated priest.

He died on April 20, 1946 in Rome.

== Works ==
The complete works of Buonaiuti are very extensive: he wrote more than three thousand works, including books and articles, among them the ponderous ''Storia del Cristianesimo'' ("History of Christianity") in three volumes, his autobiography (''Il pellegrino di Roma'') and many studies about [[Gioacchino da Fiore]] (''Gioacchino da Fiore: i tempi, la vita, il messaggio'') and [[Martin Luther]] (''Lutero e la riforma in Germania'').

=== ''Storia del Cristianesimo'' ===
The three books of ''Storia del Cristianesimo'' were published between 1942 and 1943; the first volume is about ancient times, the second is about the Middle Ages and the third is about the modern era.
It is considered Buonaiuti's most significant academic work. As he himself wrote in his autobiography of 1945, the work was motivated by apologetic reasons: "in order to draw up the definitive balance-sheet of Christian action in history, now that from a thousand signs one could easily and certainly deduce that Christianity was approaching its hour of dramatic expiration".

The main theme of the work revolves around the mystic and moral character of [[Christianity]] and its subsequent transformation into a philosofico-theological system and a bureaucratic organization. In Buonaiuti's view, the main religions are not speculative views of the world or rational schematizations of reality, but normative indications of a set of pre-rational and spiritual behaviours. Christianity, born as an announcement of [[palingenesis]], implied a huge social program "which imposed a progressive conceptual enrichment and an increasingly rigid disciplinary organization. To live and bear fruit in the world, Christianity was condemned to lose its nature and degenerate" (''Storia del cristianesimo'', I, p.&amp;nbsp;15 and seq.). The only chance of salvation for the [[Christian Church|Church]] and all of modern society is, in Buonaiuti's view, the restoration of the elementary values of primitive Christianity: love, pain, regret, death.

=== ''Il Pellegrino di Roma'' (also ''La generazione dell'esodo'') ===
The title of this autobiographical work, published in [[Rome]] in 1945, cites a definition that the Italian historian [[Luigi Salvatorelli]] gave of him, entitling one of his [[essay]]s "Ernesto Buonaiuti, pellegrino di Roma" to emphasize Buonaiuti's love for the [[Catholic Church]], despite the grave disciplinary sanctions he had to face (''La Cultura'', XII, 1933, pp.&amp;nbsp;375–391). Buonaiuti claims as his own two works of a modernist tendency published anonymously in 1908: ''Lettere di un prete modernista'' ("Letters from a Modernist Priest"), which he considered "a youth's sin", and ''Il Programma dei Modernisti'' ("The Modernists' Program"). His modernist positions are motivated by scientific reasons ([[Biblical criticism]] and [[exegesis]]). Initially his modernism seemed similar to the positions of Protestant [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theologians]] like [[Albrecht Ritschl]] and [[Adolf von Harnack]]; however, after researching spirituality in the ancient world, from [[Zarathustra]] to [[Tragedy#Greek tragedy|the Greek tragedians]], Buonaiuti began to recognize in pre-Christian spiritual experiences an anticipation of the Christian view of life. Buonaiuti claimed to be [[Catholic]] and to want to stay so ''usque dum vivam'' ("as long as I live"), as he wrote to the [[theology]] [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] of the [[University of Lausanne]], which had offered him a chair in [[History of Christianity]] if he joined the [[Calvinism|Calvinist Church]].

== Buonaiuti and John XXIII ==

Buonaiuti was an exact contemporary in Rome with Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, who was elected to the papacy as [[John XXIII]] in 1958. According to Roncalli's biographer [[Peter Hebblethwaite]] the two men were initially close friends, and this connection may have played a part in the future pope's abrupt removal from a seminary post early in his career,&lt;ref&gt;John XXIII: Pope of the Council. London: Chapman, 1984. {{ISBN|0-225-66419-4}} Revised edition Fount Paperbacks, 1994. Abridged edition Continuum, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the "Suspected of Modernism" entry which was made against Roncalli's name in his official record in the Vatican archives, something he would later refute by inserting, in his own hand "I, Pope John XXIII, have never been a Modernist".&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, L, 1973, I Will be Called John, London, Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly the friendship was never repudiated, and according to theologian Giovanni Gennari, Roncalli (who was assisted by Buonaiuti in saying his first Mass in 1904) is known to have used material written by the future excommunicate in teaching Church History.&lt;ref name="tradition"&gt;http://www.traditioninaction.org/ProgressivistDoc/A_171_Buonaiuti.html, accessed March 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Historians generally agree that the association did not taint Roncalli's orthodoxy, even if he is known to have retained a certain regard for his erstwhile colleague. Indeed [[Cardinal Capovilla]],  who was secretary to John XXIII, attributes to his late superior the following sentiments:

{{blockquote|If "poor Fr. Ernesto" had met with less harsh and stiff treatment from the Curia and more "tenderness" – he actually used that word – which now seems more and more important, perhaps his entire story would have been different. He added these two historical facts of his case: Buonaiuti remained unmarried until his death, keeping the promise of priests, and every day until his death he never failed to recite the Breviary, specific prayers said by priests and religious of the Church Catholic...&lt;ref name="tradition"/&gt;}}

== Portrayal in film ==

[[Ricky Tognazzi]]'s 2003 film ''[[The Good Pope]]'' has a character called Nicola Catania who is loosely based on Buonaiuti, although a certain amount of licence is employed. The movie has Catania, a priest deposed for Modernism, keeping vigil in [[St. Peter's Square]] as John XXIII, who had been his friend in the seminary lies dying. In actuality, Buonaiuti died in 1946 and Roncalli in 1963.

Bánáthy]], [[Riane Eisler]], [[Jack Corliss|John Corliss]], [[Francisco Varela]], [[Vilmos Csanyi]], [[Gyorgy Kampis]], [[David Loye]], [[Jonathan Schull]] and [[Eric Chaisson]] of the initially secret General Evolutionary Research Group.&lt;ref name=belabio&gt;{{cite web | title=Autoiography: Béla H. Bánáthy |url=http://www.whitestag.org/history/founders/bio_bela.html |author = [[Bela H.

Their goal was to explore whether it might be possible to use the [[chaos theory]] to identify a new [[Evolution|general theory of evolution]] that might serve as a path to a better world.

=== Club of Budapest ===
In 1993, in response to his experience with the [[Club of Rome]], he founded the [[Club of Budapest]] to, in his words, "centre attention on the evolution of human values and consciousness as the crucial factors in changing course — from a race towards degradation, polarization and disaster to a rethinking of values and priorities so as to navigate today's transformation in the direction of humanism, ethics and global sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Akashic field theory ===
László's  2004 book, ''Science and the Akashic Field: An Integral Theory of Everything'' posits a field of information as the substance of the [[cosmos]]. Using the  [[Sanskrit]] and [[Vedic language|Vedic]] term for "[[space]]", ''[[Akasha]]'', he calls this information field the "Akashic field" or "A-field". He posits that the "quantum vacuum" (see [[Vacuum state]]) is the fundamental energy and information-carrying field that informs not just the current universe, but all universes past and present (collectively, the "[[Metaverse]]").

László believes that such an informational field can explain why our universe appears to be [[Fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] so as to form galaxies and conscious lifeforms; and why [[evolution]] is an informed, not random, process. He believes that the [[hypothesis]] solves several problems that emerge from [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]], especially [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] and [[quantum entanglement]].

===The Immortal Mind===
László became interested in the consciousness theories of Anthony Peake, (who in turn was an admirer of László’s work on the Akashic Field). Peake, whose background was in the [[social sciences]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/alumni/ouralumni/alumnipublications/ Warwick authors - Warwick University alumni &amp; friends]&lt;/ref&gt; had sought to explain the fact that [[altered states of consciousness]] (such as [[deja vu]], [[dreams]], [[psychedelic drug]] experiences, [[meditation]], [[near death experience]]) sometimes seem to feature [[precognition]] and [[premonitions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptiko.com/anthony-peake-near-death-experiences-versus-actual-death/ Anthony Peake on near-death experiences versus actual death experiences - Skeptiko interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Peake had produced a tentative synthesis of the ancient idea of the “[[Eternal Return]]” with modern ideas like the [[simulation argument]], the [[holographic universe]], and the [[many worlds interpretation]]. In Peake’s hypothesis, one lives variants of the same life repeatedly, and a premonition is in fact a memory of the past.&lt;ref&gt;The Labyrinth of Time by Anthony Peake, Arcturus Publishing Ltd 2012 (prologue)&lt;/ref&gt; Peake became a Consciousness Studies Department Member at Ervin László’s Center For Advanced Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ervinlaszlo.academia.edu/AnthonyPeake Anthony Peake | Center for Advanced Studies - Academia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; László collaborated with Anthony Peake on the book ''The Immortal Mind: Science and the Continuity of Consciousness Beyond the Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NdrCBAAAQBAJ ''The Immortal Mind: Science and the Continuity of Consciousness Beyond the Brain'' by Ervin László and Anthony Peake 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macroshift theory ===
In his book ''You Can Change the World'', László  promotes a linking of [[NGO|non-government organizations]] promoting [[sustainable development]], using the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;"You Can Change the World" By Ervin Laszlo, Contributor Mikhail Gorbachev, 
SelectBooks, Inc., 2004, {{ISBN|1-59079-057-X}}, pg. 14-16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autobiography===
László has written an autobiography entitled ''Simply Genius! And Other Tales from My Life'', published by Hay House Publishers in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivera |first=Jeff |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a10970.asp |title=Pitching An Agent: Waterside Productions |publisher=Mediabistro |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In an essay, [[Stan Grof|Stanislav Grof]] compared László's work to that of [[Ken Wilber]], saying "Where Wilber outlined what an integral theory of everything should look like, Laszlo actually created one."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanislavgrof.com/pdf/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Transpersonal%20Psychology-Grof.pdf Grof, "A Brief History of Transpersonal Psychology", 14] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716130649/http://www.stanislavgrof.com/pdf/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Transpersonal%20Psychology-Grof.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Free and Independent Faction''' or '''Free and Independent Fraction''' ({{lang-ro|Fracțiunea Liberă și Independentă}}, sometimes ''Fracțiunea Liberală și Independentă'', "Independent Liberal Faction",&lt;ref name="cndrol"&gt;"Condeie", in ''[[România Liberă]]'', December 6 (18), 1886, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scurtu, p. 154; Totu, pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; commonly ''Fracționiștii'', "The F(r)actionalists") was a [[Romanian nationalism|nationalist]] and [[National liberalism|national-liberal]] party in [[Romania]], regionally centered on [[Western Moldavia]]. Originally informal, and defined by its adversaries, the Faction mainly comprised pupils and followers of the philosopher [[Simion Bărnuțiu]]. During most of its existence, it had as its recognized leader the academic and polemicist [[Nicolae Ionescu]].

Consolidated during the election of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]] as ''[[Domnitor]]'', the Faction opposed his rule, favoring either an [[elective monarchy]] with a native prince or a republican system. Factionalist [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]] bordered on violent [[xenophobia]], endorsing [[economic antisemitism]] and [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-Germanism]]. The party also stood for democratization, including radical [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and a reshaping of the [[census suffrage]], while its regional ethos resulted in support for [[federalism]], then [[communalism]]. Such stances created tension between the Factionalists and most other groups on [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|the left-liberal fringe]], making the Faction an uneasy partner in the "Red" government alliances of the 1860s and '70s. They were also opposed in Moldavia by the conservative club ''[[Junimea]]'', with whom the Faction had a consuming rivalry, and by moderate liberals such as [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], who drained the Faction of its votes after 1877.

Ionescu's career peaked in 1876, when he was [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in the "Red" cabinet of [[Ion Brătianu]], and began to separate himself from the Factionalists. He was deposed for his opposition to the [[Romanian War of Independence|war of independence]], by which time the Faction was steadily declining in importance. In the 1880s, after a brief alliance with the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]], the Faction dissolved into the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]].

==Beginnings==
The origins of Bărnuțiu's movement can be traced back to "the very last years"&lt;ref&gt;Marton, p. 26. See also Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Alexander John Cuza]] rule as ''[[Domnitor]]'' over the "[[United Principalities]]", which confederated [[Moldavia]] with neighboring [[Wallachia]]. The group was centered on the last Moldavian capital, [[Iași]], where Bărnuțiu and Ionescu were both active as educators. Following Bărnuțiu's death in 1864, the Faction had for its "chiefs" [[Alexandru Gheorghiu]], [[Alecu D. Holban]], [[Theodor Lateș]], [[Dimitrie Tacu]], Iorgu Tacu, alongside Constantin Corjescu and his brother Dimitrie. As noted by their one-time colleague [[George Panu]], they were "students and disciples of Bărnuțiu", who "had hypnotized them, had inoculated into them his fanatical ideas; they spoke like him, they dressed like him, they walked like him, and quite clearly they thought like him."&lt;ref&gt;Panu, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Defining itself as "national and liberal",&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Bărnuțianism was strongly [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] and [[Primordialism|primordialist]], circulating the claim that [[Vlach law|old Romanian law]] was purely [[Roman law]] (''see [[Origin of the Romanians]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, p. 98; Marton, p. 144; Panu, pp. 13–14; Xenopol, pp. 504–506&lt;/ref&gt; On such grounds, it conceived Romania as a modern reconstruction of the [[Roman Republic]], secured by [[protectionism]], [[anti-German sentiment]], and [[economic antisemitism]],&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, pp. 97–98; Puiu (2010), pp. 219, 221, 224, 228; Xenopol, pp. 504–506&lt;/ref&gt; going as far as to propose the expulsion of all foreigners from Romanian soil.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 77–78, 98; Scurtu, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Another eccentricity was the Factionalists' project for a [[Land reform in Romania|complete land reform]], redistributing all available land among Romanian nationals.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 78–79, 98; Marton, p. 144; Puiu (2010), p. 221, 228–229; Scurtu, p. 154; Xenopol, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most other groups existing before the creation of an independent [[Kingdom of Romania]] in the 1880s, the "vaguely liberal"&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; or "most originally liberal"&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Faction was somewhat diffuse, identified by voluntary allegiance rather than formal membership, and was mainly a [[parliamentary party]].&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 30–31, 241; Scurtu, p. 154; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 128–130, 142&lt;/ref&gt; Its earliest rally point was the gazette ''Tribuna Română'' ("Romanian Tribune"), published in 1866 as the self-styled exponent of "truly liberal and independent convictions".&lt;ref name="Puiu 2010, p. 220"&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having a longer history, the party was only formalized around January 1867, following a speech by its recognized leader, who was by then [[Nicolae Ionescu]]—his claim to speak for a "free and independent faction" was picked up as a derisive [[exonym]] by his adversaries, then accepted by the "Faction" itself; ideally, however, Ionescu favored [[non-partisan democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), pp. 100, 103–104; Xenopol, pp. 504, 525&lt;/ref&gt; A professor of law and brother of the agronomist [[Ion Ionescu de la Brad]], Ionescu had played a marginal role the [[Moldavian Revolution of 1848|Moldavian]] and [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Wallachian Revolutions of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, pp. 91–95&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856–1858, he had also supported the unionist [[National Party (Romania)|National Party]], putting out the French edition of ''[[Steaua Dunării]]'' from Brussels. His effort was partly financed by the Moldavian statesman [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], with whom Ionescu had an on and off friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the suzerainty of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Cuza's regime took steps toward solidifying the Principalities, which became the nucleus of modern Romania; however, it alienated the political class with its expansive authoritarianism. The liberal wing, or "Reds", envisioned a ceremonial role for the monarchy, within a democratized country: they "admired Cuza's democratism [but] despised his [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] methods".&lt;ref&gt;Marton, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; "Red" leaders joined conservatives and centrists in forming a "[[monstrous coalition]]" of conspirators, who toppled Cuza in February 1866 and began a search for a foreign ''Domnitor'' to inaugurate a [[hereditary monarchy]]. Eventually, after [[Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders|Philippe of Belgium]] withdrew from the race, [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] became a main candidate for the throne. The Faction itself took a distinct position against the Carlist consensus. Bărnuțian postulates allowed Factionalists to argue that a single Romanian vote against a foreign dynasty was the exercise of a [[Natural and legal rights|natural right]], and would invalidate all other opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 76–77, 515; Panu, pp. 13–14; Xenopol, p. 505&lt;/ref&gt; Still frequenting the National Party, D. Tacu took a more moderate position: like [[Vasile Pogor]] and [[Titu Maiorescu]], he was only opposed to Carol specifically, and demanded a prince from [[Romance-speaking Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, pp. 503, 506&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, a [[Romanian prince referendum, 1866|plebiscite on the monarchy]] confirmed Carol as ''Domnitor'', 685,969 votes to 224.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Constituent Chamber]] of [[Bucharest]] during the [[Romanian general election, April 1866|parallel race]], six Factionalists abstained during the vote to proclaim Carol as the hereditary ruler. Seated among the left and far-left of Chamber, they were: Ionescu, Tacu, Lateș, Nicolae Iamandi, Ianache Lecca, and Ioan Negură.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, p. 146; Puiu (2011), p. 102; Xenopol, p. 506&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking from the rostrum at the time, Ionescu, who represented six Moldavian [[Counties of Romania|counties]],&lt;ref name="Puiu 2011, p. 99"&gt;Puiu (2011), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; voiced his admiration of Cuza's constitutional law, since "although despotic, it yielded decent fruit, being applied with a sense of liberalism."&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

==1866 troubles==
[[File:Prefect Grigore M. Sturdza vs. the antisemites of Iaşi, May 25, 1866.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Grigore Sturdza]]'s proclamation upon retaking control of [[Iași]] in May 1866, condemning the "barbaric propaganda" of local antisemites]]
While their initial opposition to Carol had by then been reduced to abstentionism, the Factionalists' core constituency of Iași experienced a separatist rebellion, instigated by [[Calinic Miclescu]], Constantin Moruzi Pecheanu, Teodor Boldur-Lățescu, and Nicu Ceaur-Aslan.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 13–14, 329; Xenopol, pp. 482–500. See also Balan, pp. 70–71; Marton, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was almost immediately quashed, but moderate federalism was preserved by a plan of moving the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice|Court of Cassation]] to Iași, making that city a [[judicial capital]] of Romania. In the city itself, the Faction's "group of electors" held meetings during which some advocated full federalism with a separate civilian government for Moldavia. A motion supporting a preferential treatment for Iași was proposed by the lawyer Gheorghe Cigaras with support from Ceaur-Aslan—and also signed by Gheorghiu, Holban, Alexandru M. Șendrea, Petre Suciu, Tacu, Sandu Dudescu, [[Grigore Cobălcescu]], [[Anastasie Fătu]] and [[Vasile Gheorghian]], alongside priests [[Iosif Bobulescu]], [[Neofit Scriban]], and Climent Nicolau.&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, pp. 492, 496–498&lt;/ref&gt; However, to the dismay of other deputies who endorsed decentralization (including Tacu and Lateș), Ionescu spoke out against the Court of Cassation proposal, as he expected Iași to be more thoroughly assisted by government.&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, pp. 489–499&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol was ultimately able to take the throne, but, during the same period, there was a breakdown of consensus inside the "monstrous coalition", with heated debates over the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|passing of the Constitution]]. A "White" party, comprising centrist and conservative elements, backed Carol's hands-on and gradualist approach to institutional modernization. As claimed by the independent radical [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], the emerging anti-liberal coalition, a "scandalous phenomenon", "always paralyzed Romanianism with alienism, and democracy with reaction".&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Although "too archaic", Hasdeu claimed, the Faction "rekindled the Romanian spirit" and mounted resistance against "cosmopolitan ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; Defining itself as "decentralist and anti-absolutist unionist", the Faction was organizing throughout Western Moldavia, relying on a network of academics, schoolteachers, and youths.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), pp. 220, 228. See also Scurtu, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Bârlad]], its "national-liberal" chapter was supported by local intellectuals, including brothers Ion and Constantin Codrescu, Ioan Popescu, and [[Scarlat Vârnav]].&lt;ref&gt;Antonovici, pp. XIV–XVII, 258&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this context, a deeper controversy erupted over what Hasdeu referred to as "alienism": the issue of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jews]] and their [[Jewish Emancipation|political emancipation]], which the "Reds" and the Faction opposed. In May 1866, while a petition to block Jews from obtaining commercial rights was signed by Ionescu and circulated throughout Moldavia,&lt;ref name="Puiu 2010, p. 224"&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; antisemitic riots possibly instigated by the Faction erupted in Iași, Bârlad, [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] and [[Botoșani]]. The clampdown was led by [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefect]] [[Grigore Sturdza]], and resulted in the temporary arrest of various party leaders, including Fătu, Gheorghian, Gheorghiu, Holban and Suciu—alongside sympathizers such as [[Petru Poni]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, pp. 510–512&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by historian [[A. D. Xenopol]] (who was for a while a Factionalist sympathizer),&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Partidul...", p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; antisemitism was only present "up front" within the Moldavian Faction and taken up in Wallachia by [[Cezar Bolliac]], but also spread out, more discreetly, among the other political groups.&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, pp. 518–519, 570&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolphe Stern]], the Jewish community leader, decried the Faction's "mystical and intransigent dogmatism", infused with an "awful hatred" by the "pseudo-intellectual" Bărnuțiu.&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Reds" and the Factionalists were pushed into cooperating with each other, mainly because the "Reds" were virtually unrepresented in Moldavian cities,&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp. 22–24; Maiorescu, pp. 19, 80; Ornea, p. 253; Puiu (2010), pp. 225–226; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; but remained distinct parties; in crucial moments, the Faction voted against radicalism, rallying with the centrists.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, p. 26; Puiu (2010), pp. 225–226; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 125, 128&lt;/ref&gt; The Factionalists' extreme nationalism and antisemitism embarrassed most of the "Reds", who generally refrained from directly associating with the Faction outside of elections.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 26, 143–148&lt;/ref&gt; The other side of the alliance was also avoiding any direct association. Seen as a purely "egotistic" force by its allies,&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; the Faction always feared that the liberals were secretly "right-wing".&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 223 and (2011), pp. 100, 103&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in 1886 by Holban, the Faction also viewed "Reds" as "counterfeit [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]]", or as cosmopolitans whose stance was essentially "anti-national".&lt;ref name="masca"&gt;[[Alecu D. Holban]], "Masca jos!", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', October 1 (13), 1886, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The core disputes of 1866 centered on the reestablishment of a [[Senate of Romania|Romanian Senate]], with its implication of elitism. Hasdeu claimed at the time that "its maintenance costs us some millions a year, but provides us with no benefit, other than that it passes for a fine ornament and emanates a fragrance."&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu and the "Red" [[Nicolae Voinov]] proposed a number of successive projects, all of which were [[Unicameralism|unicameral]].&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), pp. 222–223; Xenopol, pp. 525–528&lt;/ref&gt; While supporters of [[bicameralism]] insisted that the Senate would function as a Romanian [[House of Lords]], the Factionalists and their allies ridiculed this claim when it came to [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar nobility]]. Hasdeu wrote that, in Romania, "most of the old [boyar] families have gone extinct and were replaced by a make-believe aristocracy, newly born and lacking those glorious traditions which support English aristocrats; and on the other hand, most of our notabilities, political, literary and even parliamentary, have their roots in the mass of the people".&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with mounting support for bicameralism, Ionescu and Tacu conceded defeat but, alongside [[Christian Tell]] and [[Alexandru G. Golescu]], still supported limiting the power of Senate to vote on the budget.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; However, they endorsed a bill which, if passed, would have given Senate the authority to try government ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Like various deputies on the left, they still resented the distribution of [[census suffrage]], arguing that their bourgeois voters—portrayed by Ionescu's as a "[[Estates of the realm|third-estate]]" backbone of constitutionalism—were underrepresented in the 3rd Electoral College.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 32, 174–175, 244; Puiu (2010), p. 222 and (2011), pp. 103–104; Xenopol, pp. 535–538&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu supported a two-college system and found it deplorable that, under the provisions for [[weighted voting]], peasants had a 1:40,000 ratio of representation, and landowners a 1:40.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 222 and (2011), pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Faction, like the entire political class, rejected both [[universal suffrage]] and [[direct democracy]], seeing Romanians, and peasants especially, as fundamentally immature for enfranchisement.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, p. 263; Puiu (210), p. 222 and (2011), pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concordia alliance==
In October 1866, after "difficult" negotiations with the [[Sublime Porte]],&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Carol also secured his international recognition, which relieved the need for consensus and allowed party politics to develop further. Following the [[Romanian general election, November 1866|election of November]], in which Ionescu became a perennial deputy for [[Roman County]],&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; the legislature was split evenly between "Reds", "Whites", and a heterogeneous coalition of Cuza loyalists and Moldavian separatists; the parties of "the left", including the Faction, had some 20 deputy seats.&lt;ref&gt;Scurtu, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; During later contests for the new Senate seats, a more complex "Red" coalition emerged. Formalized as the Concordia Agreement in March 1867, it also included a group of moderates led by Kogălniceanu.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp. 14–21; Marton, pp. 75–76, 183, 191; Puiu (2010), pp. 217–218; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 122–125, 128&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a Kogălniceanu rival, Ionescu never signed up to the Concordia platform, and his colleagues only adhered to some of its tenets.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 217; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 125, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing the configuration of Chamber, this alliance toppled the moderate [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion Ghica]], producing three successive radical cabinets, respectively headed by [[Constantin A. Crețulescu]], [[Ștefan Golescu]], and [[Nicolae Golescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp. 14–15; Marton, pp. 75–76, 143–144, 153, 191–200, 285; Puiu (2010), pp. 217–219, 225–226; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 122–125, 128. See also Maiorescu, pp. 80, 439, 515–517; Panu, p. 99; Totu, pp. 123–147&lt;/ref&gt; These inaugurated investment in public works, modified electoral laws, and reduced the powers of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Minister of Internal Affairs]], "Red" doctrinaire [[Ion Brătianu]] worked to influence elections in favor the Concordia group, especially [[Romanian general election, 1867|during December 1867]].&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 191–200; Scurtu, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; The new majority had some 85 seats in Chamber,&lt;ref&gt;Scurtu, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; of which some 14 were Factionalists—known to include Ionescu, Fătu, Gheorghiu, A. D. Holban, Lateș, Negură, Suciu, D. Tacu, Voinov, Ianache Lecca, Dumitru Lupașcu, Mantu Rufu, I. Strejescu, and Dumitru Țanu Vidrașcu.&lt;ref name="revp4-68"&gt;"Revista politica", in ''[[Ghimpele]]'', Nr. 4/1868, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Vârnav, winner of the 4th college seat for [[Tutova County|Tutova]], died mysteriously before confirmation. His partisans claimed that he had been poisoned by Jews, sparking another antisemitic riot.&lt;ref&gt;"Bucurescĭ 28 Îndrea 1867/9 Cărindariŭ 1868", in ''[[Românul|Romanulu]]'', December 25–29, 1867, p. 1105; "D–luĭ Redactore alŭ d̦iaruluĭ Românulŭ", in ''Romanulu'', January 1–3, 1868, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faction was awarded the [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber Presidency]], held by Fătu, but remained suspicious of the "Reds".&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; The staunch "ethnic protectionism" and "hysteric xenophobia" of both nationalist parties, including their claim that Jews were incapable of [[Jewish assimilation|assimilating]],&lt;ref&gt;Marton, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; ensured that the Constitution only granted citizenship to Christians. Moreover, at Internal Affairs, Brătianu went against Carol's advice, ordering "severe measures against the Jews and foreign 'vagabonds'."&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 24, 155&lt;/ref&gt; Such policies were reportedly advocated, and imposed on him, by the Faction.&lt;ref&gt;Balan, p. 68; Brătescu, pp. 15–22; Gafița, pp. 97–98; Maiorescu, pp. 515–517; Puiu (2010), pp. 221–222, 225–226; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 125; Totu, pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; During the interval, thirty-one deputies, Fătu included, presented a bill with exceptionally harsh antisemitic provisions, but this was defeated by an ad-hoc Chamber majority.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Lateș also proposed to only grant Christians the "political right" of owning land; his bill was also defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 519&lt;/ref&gt; The xenophobic stance was reportedly gaining momentum in Moldavia, with Factionalist professors expressing "aversion" toward [[Westernization]], and purposefully ignoring "foreign literature and art".&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; Their protectionism blended with [[natalism]] in another proposal, advanced at one time by Suciu, which would have overtaxed [[bachelor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, p. 45; Săteanu, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 1867 to October 1870, in times of "maximum political strife",&lt;ref&gt;Marton, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu put out the Factionalist newspaper ''Dreptatea'' ("Justice" or "Fairness"). As outlined here, the ideology of Factionalism also comprised fringe positions, including [[criticism of Christianity]]—Ionescu viewed conversion to Christianity as a prerequisite of citizenship and the [[state religion]],&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 224 and (2011), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; but argued that the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] was too indebted to [[Judaism]] and "the Greeks".&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 144, 147&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the promise of full land reform, Moldavian regionalism resurfaced as [[communalism]]: the Faction believed that the executive should be closely monitored by the Chamber, and stood by the notion that [[Communes of Romania|communes]] were autonomous units of the state. On this point, Factionalists were irreconcilable with the "Reds", who favored quick centralization and a [[unitary state]].&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 147–149, 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; The regionalist agenda was expanded on by another Factionalist newspaper, ''D̦iorile'' ("The Dawn"), accused by other liberals of wanting to "divide the country into [[satrap]]ies".&lt;ref name="revp4-68"/&gt;

Despite this, and although the Faction voted against development loans from the [[Oppenheim family]], Ionescu also supported the common nationalist agenda, favoring [[Romanian leu|a national currency]] and the construction of a centralized transport infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), pp. 218, 225–226 and (2011), pp. 107–109&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond its advocacy of xenophobic restrictions, the Faction also viewed itself as a watchdog for individual freedoms, and lauded the introduction of jury trials as a testing ground for extended suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 147, 258–261, 263&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu in particular favored a focus on [[civics]], rather than [[vocational education]], in the state-funded primary schools.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 130–138&lt;/ref&gt; From March 1868, Ionescu and Ianache Lecca were also instrumental in reforming the nationwide Civic Guard, which acted as a reserve and police force. Their project called for the Guard to no longer be a paramilitary wing of the "Red" caucus, and become a more reliable ''[[Landwehr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Totu, pp. 140–145&lt;/ref&gt;

Brătianu confirmed Ionescu's suspicions in April 1868, when he canvassed direct support for the "Reds" at Iași. His trip was a disappointment, drawing a mob which protested violently against his schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, p. 23, See also Puiu (2010), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Romanian Senate election, 1868|July 1868 race]], Ionescu took a seat in the Senate, where he remained until 1870.&lt;ref name="Puiu 2011, p. 99"/&gt; His leaving the Factionalist leadership in Chamber was deplored as a major loss by his replacement, Gheorghiu.&lt;ref name="Puiu 2010, p. 220"/&gt; However, the Faction still dominated Moldavian politics, enlisting affiliations from the moderate liberal [[Gheorghe Mârzescu]]&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), pp. 219–220, 228&lt;/ref&gt; and from urban professionals, variously including Dimitrie Anghel (father of [[Dimitrie Anghel|the poet]]), [[Scarlat Pastia]], [[Miltiade Tzony]], and [[Ștefan Micle]].&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Partidul...", p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1868, it also had the support of [[Ion Creangă]], a rebellious priest and aspiring writer who attended electoral meetings and Faction primaries. It was during these that Creangă clashed with the local "White" orator, [[Iacob Negruzzi]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Streinu]], "Ion Creangă", in [[Șerban Cioculescu]], [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', p. 260. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973. See also Săteanu, pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Junimea'' and "White" consolidation==
Iași was by then home to a cultural and political club, called ''[[Junimea]]'', which soon presented a structured opposition to both Ionescu's group, and, from 1870, a distinct branch of the "White" movement; it was able to attract within its ranks some of the junior Factionalists, including Creangă, Panu, and Xenopol, as well as conservatives such as Negruzzi. ''Junimea''{{'}}s Wallachian founder, [[Titu Maiorescu]], published essays directly attacking the cornerstones of Bărnuțiu's politics, and Romanian liberalism as a whole, from the implicit position of [[liberal conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, pp. 301–303; Maiorescu, pp. 21, 48–50, 73–84; Marton, pp. 160–163; Ornea, pp. 77–78, 252–258&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he rejected the Faction's ideas on land reform as "communistic", expressing his astonishment that an anti-state party had been allowed to govern at all.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 78–80, 99–109, 515–526&lt;/ref&gt; Maiorescu's friend [[Petre P. Carp]] also attacked Factionalism through his newspaper, ''Térra'', which declared itself the voice of true liberalism in its constitutionalist, monarchist, version.&lt;ref&gt;Balan, ''passim''; Marton, pp. 154–160&lt;/ref&gt; Especially through Carp, ''Junimism'' condemned the Faction's xenophobia, and called for the protection of Romanian Jews;&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, pp. 98, 100–101; Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, pp. 301, 303; Marton, p. 155; Ornea, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Maiorescu also described Ionescu's party "ephemeral", defined by its "hatred of foreigners, and in particular Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, p. 19. See also Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt;

The Factionalists took notice of such reactions, and the conflict between them and the ''Junimists'' became exceptionally bitter—the two camps were deadly enemies to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, pp. 97–102; Ghenghea, p. 116; Marton, p. 146; Ornea, p. 253; Panu, pp. 18–19, 26–29, 45–46, 48, 57, 64–65, 73, 105, 113; Puiu (2010), p. 227; Săteanu, pp. 7–12, 38–39, 42, 254, 331; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 125 and "Partidul...", p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Factionalist propaganda portrayed the ''Junimists'' as "[[Freemasonry in Romania|Freemasons]]" and as "hirelings" of the external enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Balan, p. 71; Gafița, p. 101. See also Panu, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This political dispute highlighted earlier rivalries, which began in 1864, when Maiorescu and Ionescu accused each other of adultery.&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, p. 100; Săteanu, pp. 10–12&lt;/ref&gt; Factionalists Suciu and Cobălcescu had also lodged a legal complaint against Maiorescu, claiming, spuriously so, that he lacked Romanian citizenship and was therefore ineligible for political office.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 439–440; Săteanu, pp. 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; On the ''Junimist'' side, the response was provided by Negruzzi, who published number of pamphlets depicting Ionescu and the Factionalists as irrational demagogues.&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, pp. 101–102; Panu, pp. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; ''Junimea'' also kept a record of "inanities" published in the Factionalist newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Panu, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Red" series in government ended in November 1868, when Carol, troubled by the excesses of antisemitism, began selecting his ministers from the moderate right.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp. 26–27; Marton, pp. 24, 28–29, 33, 74–76, 200–202. See also Maiorescu, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; Carol also apologized for the sufferings of his Jewish subjects, which led the Faction to issue a protest; its senators also voted against the N. Golescu government when it did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Brătescu, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu supported Golescu and Brătianu's definition of the Jews as "vagabonds", but declared his disappointment at their moderation.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; As noted at the time by Carp, Brătianu was shying away from official antisemitism, and only instrumenting it through "anarchy" and "the rabble in the streets"; the Faction, he argued, was at least consistent in seeking out a legal method.&lt;ref&gt;"Romani'a. Adunarea deputatiloru. Sedinti'a de la 26 aprilie 8 maiu 1868", in ''Federatiunea'', Nr. 68/1868, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

The Concordia alliance crumbled before the [[Romanian general election, 1869|election of March 1869]], with Kogălniceanu, who resented the Golescus' external policies,&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), pp. 216–217, 218; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 124–125, 128&lt;/ref&gt; joining [[Dimitrie Ghica]]'s ministry. The election itself was a sound defeat for the left: the "Reds" took 10 seats in Chamber and the Faction only 8, with the moderates and "Whites" sharing 120.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 23–25, 200–201, 215–219. See also Scurtu, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were widespread reports and complaints that Kogălniceanu had advised local authorities to condone fraud and to intimidate the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 201–219, 238–241, 286; Săteanu, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt; According to one account, the defector Mârzescu, serving as Prefect of [[Iași County]], personally ensured that Kogălniceanu won a deputy's seat against Ionescu.&lt;ref&gt;Săteanu, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1870, a new majority of moderates was formed around D. Ghica and [[Manolache Costache Epureanu|Manolache Epureanu]]—calling themselves the "Party of Order"—, with the adherence of [[Efrem Ghermani]] and [[Cezar Bolliac]]. According to Hasdeu, this was a "broth of boyars and democrats", existing only to keep "the Reds and the Faction" out of office.&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, pp. 268–269&lt;/ref&gt; Hasdeu also accused Epureanu of wanting to naturalize and introduce Jews into the country, under the guise of constitutionalism: "So the Constitution will appear to be standing, although trampled upon by the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, pp. 271–272&lt;/ref&gt; He called for an antisemitic unification—of liberals, radicals and nationalists—into a "great party of action", "purified of all things bastard, all things cosmopolitan".&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, pp. 270–273&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republicanism==
[[File:M. B. Baer - Trageţi dreptŭ la inimă, Ghimpele, 7 iun 1870.JPG|thumb|270px|June 1870 caricature in the "Red" gazette ''[[Ghimpele]]'', showing the [[Manolache Costache Epureanu|Epureanu]] cabinet (including [[Petre P. Carp]]) shooting down he protesters in [[Pitești]]; the gibbon "Scarlat", a stand-in for [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], is shown ordering the atrocity]]
As noted by historian Silvia Marton, the marginalized "Reds" first began talking of republicanism in the early months of 1869—"chipping away at Carol's strength and authority" despite their setbacks.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; While Ionescu attended official functions honoring the ''Domnitor'' well into 1869,&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 221 and (2011), p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; the Faction discarded its early project for a native dynasty (which it now deemed "the imperialistic regime") and, like the Wallachian radicals, embraced republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 26–28, 144–146&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Factionalist deputies such as Ion Codrescu still expressed a hope that the throne could stand for "the country as a whole", and reaffirmed their conditional support for Carol.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The republican drift was accentuated by the [[Romanian general election, 1870|elections of May 1870]]. These were entirely manufactured by Carol, who was arguably overstepping constitutional bounds.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 28–30, 157–158, 173, 221, 284–287&lt;/ref&gt; They took place in a climate of violence and uncertainty, with riots in Bucharest, [[Giurgiu]], and [[Pitești]].&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, p. 274; Marton, pp. 153, 221–241&lt;/ref&gt; In his editorial of June 3, Hasdeu called Epureanu a "butcher", but warned that "a nation is like iron: the more you strike at it, the more it will harden."&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Epureanu managed to set up a "Hen and Fledgling Cabinet" that included ''Junimist'' Carp at [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Affairs]]. This was an early sign of the success of anti-Factionalism in Moldavia, where ''Junimea'' was growing into a political movement. The election, however, produced 34 deputies who, according to Hasdeu, stood for the "independent current, whose banner, the one it raised only yesterday, has managed to overwhelm with its vigor the authoritarian school."&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside Ionescu, I. Codrescu, Fătu, Gheorghiu, A. D. Holban, Negură, Suciu, Voinov, and Tacu, these were: [[Stroe Belloescu]], [[Constantin Bosianu]], [[Alexandru Lăzărescu-Laerțiu]], [[Gheorghe Lecca]], [[Costache Negri]], [[Nicolae Gr. Racoviță]], [[Nicolae Rosetti-Bălănescu]], [[George D. Vernescu]], I. Adrian, Ion Agarici, N. Bossie, Costin Brăescu, D. Comănăsceanu, Leon Eraclide, E. Filipescu, I. Gâlcă, M. Ganea, P. Georgiade, V. Holban, Dumitru Lupașcu, George Mantu, L. Moldoveanu, Constantin Scafesu, G. Sefendache, G. Vucenicu.&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; This count may include "Red" sympathizers: according to Marton, the Faction only had 25 deputies, and the "Reds" 32—at 57 seats, their alliance actually had a slim majority; government was backed by neutral "Whites", and by a slim majority of senators.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, p. 221–222. See also Scurtu, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the caucus of various liberal groups and tendencies was especially weak, ridiculed by outsiders as a "perfectly undecided" legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chamber, Voinov had verbal duels with moderates such as [[Constantin Boerescu]] over suspicions of electoral fraud by [[political boss]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 223–225&lt;/ref&gt; During such bouts, he insisted that the Civic Guard had moral a duty to "rise up and protect" the people.&lt;ref&gt;Totu, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; There were other calls for a revolution in Wallachia, all sparked by popular support for the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]—while Carol and some of his ministers favored the [[North German Confederation|German coalition]]. In radical circles, despite an awareness that France was under an illiberal regime, the war was depicted as a struggle "between freedom and despotism."&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 17, 33–34, 133–136&lt;/ref&gt; After some reluctance, with Ionescu noting that nobody in Europe cared about Romania's positioning,&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Francophile]] tenets were also taken up by the Factionalists. In Chamber, Ionescu and Gheorghiu spoke against neutrality, asking Epureanu and Carp to at least express moral sympathy for France, and proposing that Chamber be put in control of foreign policies.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 246, 247–250, 264&lt;/ref&gt;

By August, Wallachian radicals became involved in the incident known as "[[Republic of Ploiești]]", which ended in a police round-up of prominent "Reds". Several were tried for sedition, but acquitted by a sympathetic jury.&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, pp. 285–287, 311–312; Maiorescu, pp. 19–26; Marton, pp. 42–69, 91–95, 124–132; Puiu (2011), p. 102; Totu, pp. 239–244&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dreptatea'' condemned the "ridiculous rebellion", arguing that its instigators were inconsistent democrats, and dwelling on the older critique of Wallachian centralism; the "republic", Ionescu theorized, would only have reinforced the subjugation of Moldavian communes, while also imposing a one-party regime.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 145–146, 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; This denunciation, Marton notes, was possibly prompted by fear of prosecution—in Chamber, Negură and Ionescu pushed through a declaration that denounced sedition, but also proclaimed their support for democratic change and for more parliamentary control.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 258–259, 263&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Ionescu expressed solidarity with the chief conspirator, [[Alexandru Candiano-Popescu]].&lt;ref name="Puiu 2011, p. 102"&gt;Puiu (2011), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The Faction then announced its alternative program to devolve the country into an [[elective monarchy]], as a necessary transition to full republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting dispute led to a [[motion of no confidence]], and Epureanu was deposed. This marked Ion Ghica's return as Prime Minister, a temporary arrangement which seemed to satisfy both the "Reds" and the Faction.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 250–252, 268–270. See also Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, pp. 289–295&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with mounting opposition, Carol threatened to resign, and another conspiracy, headed by [[Eugeniu Carada]], prepared to take over government; the status quo was preserved only after Brătianu asked Carada to rescind.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 141, 166, 264–272&lt;/ref&gt; The "Reds" reverted to an earlier stance, and endorsed Carol as the legitimate ''Domnitor''; Ionescu and the Faction agitated for the election of a Romanian monarch, but superficially endorsed legalism, and recognized Carol as a legitimate ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 268–272, 281. See also Puiu (2010), pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catargiu's ascendancy==
[[File:Paserile de prada, Asmodeu, 14 apr 1874.png|thumb|320px|April 1874 cartoon in the "Red" magazine ''Asmodeu'': Romania as a young warrior, stripped down by [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]] raptors and the [[Coat of arms of Prussia|Prussian eagle]]]]
The period was also marked by another controversy, called "[[Strousberg Affair]]", which tarnished the early history of [[Căile Ferate Române|Romanian railways]], rekindled xenophobia, and endangered Romania's relations with the [[German Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 26–36, 247, 486–487; Marton, pp. 138, 272–284&lt;/ref&gt; This scandal emerged from laws that the Faction had approved of or abstained on (excluding Lăzărescu-Laerțiu, who was an early opponent of the deal);&lt;ref&gt;Th. I. Focșăneanul, "''Stroĭe Corbeanul'' de Alexandru Lazarescul (Laerțiŭ). Operă postumă, precedată de viața și operele luĭ. (Urmare)", in ''Revista Literară'', Nr. 9/1892, pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, it was largely attributed to the German and Jewish scheming.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 138, 274–275, 282. See also Puiu (2010), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Following the anti-German riot at [[Casa Capșa]], which he blamed on poor crowd control, Carol ordered Ghica's cabinet to resign. After again threatening to resign himself, he eventually settled on creating a "White" cabinet under [[Lascăr Catargiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 27–36; Marton, pp. 279–281&lt;/ref&gt; The situation upset Factionalist deputies: alongside their "Red" colleague [[Nicolae Fleva]], Ionescu, Gheorghiu and Codrescu alleged that Catargiu was being forced on them by the [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian military]], and more discreetly by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 280–284&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1871, Carol and Foreign Minister [[Gheorghe Costaforu]] traveled to Moldavia, contacting the monarchist circles, in particular ''Junimea''.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, arch-conservatives and some of their ''Junimist'' backers caused a stir with their endorsement of [[Grigore Sturdza]]'s bills to amend the constitution. These endorsed a more stringent limitation of suffrage, the screening of senators by the ''Domnitor'', the [[Death penalty in Romania|death penalty]] for murder, and curbs on press freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 54–71, 320–334; Ornea, pp. 258–262, 264–265&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, Sturdza and his allies also favored opening the country to [[Regat Germans|German colonists]].&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, p. 297; Maiorescu, pp. 65–66, 69; Ornea, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; These proposals went unanswered, with Ionescu and Kogălniceanu threatening a revolt of the people.&lt;ref name="Puiu 2010, p. 224"/&gt; However, the conservative trend was consolidated in the [[Romanian general election, 1871|May 1871 election]]. The opposition was again coalesced: the Factionalists, the "Reds", and Kogălniceanu all stood for the "convened liberal party" or "the left";&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 226; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, the "Whites" had a solid win. It inaugurated five years of conservative government, with Catargiu as Prime Minister, while conspiratorial republicans, including Brătianu and [[C. A. Rosetti]], failed to win seats.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 13–15, 138–139&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking for the far-left opposition, Hasdeu claimed that the election had been rigged, since intellectuals and aristocrats such as Maiorescu and Sturdza had been elected by peasant voters in the 4th College.&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, pp. 295–297&lt;/ref&gt;

Catargiu's administration brought the "routinization of political conflict", which, although violent in tone, remained mindful of constitutional arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 13–15, 165–173&lt;/ref&gt; It also witnessed the peak of reciprocal attacks between ''Junimea'' and the Faction: as deputy, and then as [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Education Minister]], Maiorescu began investigating the politicization of higher learning, and in particular the work of Ionescu and other Factionalists at [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|Iași University]].&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 73–109, 234–240, 285–287, 342–384, 439–476, 504–528; Panu, p. 113; Puiu (2010), p. 227 and (2011), pp. 111–114; Ornea, pp. 262–269. See also Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Such measures prompted Cobălcescu, who represented the University, to resign from Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 518–521&lt;/ref&gt; However, both Maiorescu and Ionescu were incensed when a "White" minister, [[Christian Tell]], forced provincial academics to choose between their chairs and their deputy seats in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 114–123; Ornea, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871–1874, the dispute between Ionescu and Maiorescu focused on the rural communes, their administration and economy. The new law of 1874 imposed centralization, allowing government to select mayors from a pool of elected councilors.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 147–149&lt;/ref&gt; In his interventions, Ionescu supported communal autonomy as the basis for democratic self-government. Instead, Maiorescu noted that the democratic experiment had only created frail institutions, and proposed to curb this with "feudalism", by giving rich landowners over-representation in communal councils.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 214–227. See also Puiu (2011), pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, at Iași, Holban, Tacu and the Corjescus mounted the opposition against a ''Junimist'' communal administration, headed by Mayor [[Nicolae Gane]] and Prefect [[Leon C. Negruzzi]] (Iacob's brother). As Ceaur-Aslan lost an auction to pave the city streets, a Factionalist newspaper, ''Uniunea Liberală'' ("Liberal Union"), claimed that Gane's public works were a graft from the Catargiu [[spoils system]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghenghea, pp. 116–118. See also Săteanu, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1872, Gane and Holban almost dueled over the insinuations.&lt;ref&gt;Ghenghea, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionescu was also highly critical of the Conservative laws on labor contracts, arguing that hired hands had been stripped of all means to pressure their landowning employers.&lt;ref name="Puiu 2010 p. 222"&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 222 and (2011), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Maiorescu also took a more protectionist stance than Sturdza, Costaforu, and Factionalists such as Ceaur-Aslan, demanding that foreign investors be barred from buying land in Romania for a period of ten years; his opponents only demanded a two-year term.&lt;ref&gt;Maiorescu, pp. 186–192&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu, for his part, supported the establishment of native [[credit union]]s with the introduction of unrestricted capitalism, and spoke out against state monopolies for tobacco and alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), pp. 105–107&lt;/ref&gt;

==1875 return==

Bottom left is the "Center", depicted as a headless calf ready for purchase]]
From early 1871,&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, pp. 297–300; Marton, pp. 281, 286–287; Puiu (2010), p. 226; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 121–126&lt;/ref&gt; the "Reds" began talks of fusion with the Factionalists and with all other liberal clubs. The cause was popularized by the two new Factionalist organs: ''Uniunea Liberală'' and ''Gazeta de Bacău'' ("Bacău Gazette").&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, pp. 298–300. See also Panu, p. 105; Scurtu, p. 154; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; These negotiations took years: the alliance, also known as the coalition of "[[Stephen Bartlett Lakeman|Mozhar Pasha]]", only transformed itself into the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL) in 1875 or after. According to some accounts, the Faction joined the coalition, but not the party.&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 124–136 and "Partidul...", pp. 102, 105–111&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources suggest that the Faction, including its rural chapters, was "folded into the bosom of the Liberal Party".&lt;ref name="Puiu 2010, p. 227"&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romanian general election, 1875|elections of that year]] also created an understanding between Epureanu's "independent conservative" faction and Brătianu, allowing them to govern together.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, pp. 269, 272–275; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 125–126. See also Maiorescu, pp. 192, 256–257, 320–334, 521–522, 580–582&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Romanian general election, 1876|electoral sweep of 1876]], 18 Factionalists, including Ionescu, took seats as PNL deputies.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 227; Scurtu, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; The PNL's secure victory, and a subsequent rapprochement with Carol, toned down republicanism, which was only expressed by dissenters such as Rosetti and Carada.&lt;ref&gt;Marton, pp. 138–143, 166&lt;/ref&gt; As leader of the Faction, his name absent from the cabinet proposal,&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu also continued to voice the old credo, insisting that the republic was "the most liberal, most democratic, most perfect" regime.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 221 and (2011), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Against the changing consensus, he also defended alleged perpetrators of antisemitic violence.&lt;ref name="Puiu 2010, p. 224"/&gt;

With Brătianu as head of government, Ionescu served briefly as Vice President of Chamber.&lt;ref name="Puiu 2011, p. 99"/&gt; Following a reshuffle, during which the moderates again withdrew and the Faction became an important partner in government,&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed Foreign Minister. The younger Factionalist, [[Ștefan C. Șendrea]], was one of his trusted secretaries.&lt;ref name="cndrol"/&gt; Their policy still differed from the PNL's: Ionescu did not look favorably on the project to shed Ottoman suzerainty, and felt that Romania should declare herself a [[neutral country]].&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, pp. 91, 102; Puiu (2010), pp. 225, 227, 229 and (2011), pp. 109–110; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 135–137&lt;/ref&gt; Since the guarantees of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] would have been voided by independence, he feared that the country would end up under a foreign occupation,&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 225 and (2011), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; and was especially troubled by any empowerment of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in office, Ionescu also toned down his own protectionism. He supported fixed [[tariff]]s against Kogălniceanu's free-trade agenda, but argued that [[import substitution industrialization]] generated "bad, overpriced merchandise"; by 1877, he endorsed reciprocal free-trade agreements with the major exporters of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; In other areas, the Faction took the initiative for asserting Romanian autonomy. By December 1876, Factionalist deputies, led by [[Andrei Vizanti]], submitted a project to set up the [[National Bank of Romania]]. The motion, criticized in the press as amateurish, was eventually defeated in that form.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
This period in government preceded the Faction's ultimate downfall. Now identified as one of the "center-left" parliamentary leaders, Ionescu parted with the Faction during his tenure, leaving his Moldavian colleagues in Chamber as an unaffiliated group.&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1877, Kogălniceanu, [[George D. Vernescu]] and other moderates withdrew from the embryonic PNL, leaving it to be taken over by the "Reds"; the Faction remained aligned with the "Mozhar Pasha" group.&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 128–129, 135&lt;/ref&gt; Its list of adversaries included, from April, a Moderate Liberal Party—formed in Moldavia by Kogălniceanu and Mârzescu, alongside [[Eugeniu Alcaz]], [[Vasile Conta]], and [[Telemac Ciupercescu]]. Also antisemitic, this new group saw itself as a morally superior alternative on the left, specifically designed to replace the Faction.&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Partidul...", pp. 114–117, 127&lt;/ref&gt; Kogălniceanu in particular criticized Ionescu's performance at Foreign Affairs, accusing him of incompetence and of wasting government resources on the Factionalist [[political machine]]; he called on Brătianu to renounce his alliance with Ionescu's "insignificant liberal group".&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Partidul...", pp. 108–111, 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; He achieved this goal the same month, when he himself took up the position of Foreign Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", pp. 137–138 and "Partidul...", pp. 110–111, 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; Other Factionalists continued to serve in more minor positions: Gheorghian was Prefect of Iași County, but constantly pressured by the Moderate Liberals into resigning.&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 141 and "Partidul...", pp. 117, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Managed by Brătianu and Kogălniceanu, and under a temporary truce between the PNL and the "Whites",&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, pp. 270–271&lt;/ref&gt; the country [[Romanian War of Independence|pursued her independence]], entering the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]]. On May 9, 1877, as Kogălniceanu proclaimed national sovereignty, Ionescu was one of two deputies to abstain.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2010), p. 225 and (2011), p. 109; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; As a Factionalist senator, Voinov voted against independence.&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; However, other Factionalists, including Vizanti and Tzony, enlisted for service in the Civic Guard of Iași, training alongside adversaries such as Carp, Maiorescu, and Pogor.&lt;ref&gt;Totu, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Ionescu resumed his campaigning for a more liberal regime for land-and-labor disputes. He and Vizanti proposed state regulations of contracts between landowners and peasants, as well as a continued system of land distribution from state property to landless veterans.&lt;ref name="Puiu 2010 p. 222"/&gt;

[[File:M. B. Baer- Intimpinarea dlui C. A. Roseti la întoarcerea'i în patrie, Bobârnacul, 4 mar 1879.png|thumb|370px|Antisemitic cartoon published in ''Bobârnacul'' after the [[Congress of Berlin]]. It shows [[C. A. Rosetti]], in ''[[shtreimel]]'', ''[[kaftan]]'' and ''[[payot]]'', as a patron of the Jews]]
By February 1878, various Factionalists were questioning Ionescu's authority, and considering a merger with either the PNL or the Moderate Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The PNL "Reds" were again nominally allied with the Faction, pushing aside Kogălniceanu—the latter's party sided instead with a Conservative-Liberal group, headed by the old anti-Factionalist Sturdza.&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Partidul...", pp. 123–125&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Romanian general election, 1878|election of April]], the PNL list in Iași was headlined by the former ''Junimist'' [[Vasile Alecsandri]], with Fătu, Gheorghian, Gheorghiu, Holban, Pastia, and A. Șendrea among the lesser candidates; ''Junimea'' and the Conta–Mârzescu–Ciupercescu group ran on the Conservative-Liberal ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Săteanu, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; As Minister of the Interior, C. A. Rosetti visited Iași and met with the Factionalist leaders at România Hotel. Fearful of not losing electoral power and hence offices, they vetoed Rosetti's plan to rewrite the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Partidul...", p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The party soon switched tactics: Tacu and his younger disciple, Coco Dimitrescu-Iași, were putting out the group's newspaper, ''Mișcarea Națională'' ("National Movement"), strongly anti-government and critical of Brătianu's "[[Byzantinism]]".&lt;ref name="masca"/&gt; The debates over antisemitism were rekindled by the [[Congress of Berlin]], which asked Romania to naturalize its Jews. The PNL divided itself over the issue, and the Factionalists reemerged with their old nationalist message. However, they found themselves unable to compete with a younger category of antisemitic activists, rallied by Conta.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Conta Kernbach, "Biografia lui B. Conta (Adăugiri și îndreptări)", in ''[[Viața Romînească]]'', Nr. 10–11–12/1915, pp. 56–62&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu objected to the liberalization of citizenship laws, describing them the process as a "stain on modern Romanian society."&lt;ref name="Puiu 2010, p. 224"/&gt; While Rosetti and his ''[[Românul]]'' advocated a compromise, Ionescu and Vernescu proposed defying the international consensus, even at the risk of independence not being recognized; they only recommended naturalizing those Jews "who will ask us to".&lt;ref name="gtr9979"&gt;"Revista diuaristica", in ''[[Gazeta de Transilvania|Gazet'a Transilvaniei]]'', Nr. 72/1879, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Tzony took a more moderate position, advocating citizenship rights for Jewish war veterans and, "in due time", emancipation for the community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;"Bucuresci, 27 Iuniu", in ''Telegraphul'', June 28, 1879, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
During the [[Romanian general election, 1879|election of 1879]], Factionalists endorsed Catargiu's catch-all [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]], and ran on a common list. The alliance was defeated, obtaining only 15 seats in Chamber; a full merger between the two parties was not attempted, with the Conservatives noting that they "needed no such grafting."&lt;ref&gt;"Arena ziarelor", in ''[[România Liberă]]'', June 18, 1880, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1880, with most of the Moderate Liberals absorbed into the PNL,&lt;ref&gt;Știrbăț, "Partidul...", pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu and some who had debuted with the Faction, including Ștefan Șendrea, joined Vernescu's own Sincere Liberal Party, which sought to reclaim the middle-class vote.&lt;ref name="cndrol"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), p. 110; Scurtu, p. 154; Știrbăț, "Marea formațiune...", p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu was for a while a member of the Central Committee of that party,&lt;ref name="Puiu 2011, p. 110"&gt;Puiu (2011), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; which was sometimes referred to as the "Vernescu–Ionescu liberal faction".&lt;ref name="gtr9979"/&gt; According to seething diary entries by ''Domnitor'' Carol, in 1881 Catargiu, Vernescu and Ionescu had formed "something like a party", and were [[filibuster]]ing in Chamber against PNL laws.&lt;ref name="Puiu 2011, p. 110"/&gt;

Allied with Rosetti, Ionescu was unable to make the constitution itself more liberal, but, in 1882, managed to reform the labor contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), pp. 105, 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; By then, he had renounced the cause of republicanism, backing the [[Kingdom of Romania]] upon its proclamation in March 1881. H was also warning against anti-state agitation by the socialists and foreign "[[Nihilist movement|Nihilists]]", while rejecting a PNL project to place all radicals under police supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), pp. 102, 108&lt;/ref&gt; In socialist circles, Holban and Tzony were known for participating in the crackdown against Moldavian socialism: allegedly, they engineered the persecution of [[Nikolai Sudzilovsky]], [[Theodor Speranția]], and [[Ioan Nădejde]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Gîrbea, "Asupra învățămîntuluĭ la noĭ", in ''[[Contemporanul]]'', Nr. 10/1888, pp. 307–311&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1880, the PNL chapters in Moldavia had begun a focused campaign to "coerce [the Faction] into merging with the National Liberal party."&lt;ref&gt;Antonovici, p. XV&lt;/ref&gt; As a sign of this rapprochement, in 1882 several old Factionalist parliamentarians, including Ionescu, supported measures to fold the Civic Guard into the regular army.&lt;ref&gt;Totu, pp. 280–288&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Romanian general election, 1884|election of 1884]], Tacu, Ștefan Șendrea, Gheorghiu and their colleagues left the Faction to take up PNL seats in Chamber, being criticized by the anti-Brătianu camp for their quick transformation into disciplined party cadres.&lt;ref name="masca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Noua Constituție", in ''[[Lupta]]'', July 26, 1884, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Ionescu won a deputy's seat at Roman, returning to Chamber for a final term in the [[Romanian general election, October 1888|October 1888 election]], but at Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), pp. 99–100, 102&lt;/ref&gt; His Sincere Liberals still existed, absorbing remnants of the Moderate Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;Scurtu, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu was again hostile to Carol, now [[King of the Romanians]], objecting to the creation of a Crown Domain under [[Ioan Kalinderu]] and defending Tzony when the latter was indicted for ''[[lèse-majesté]]''.&lt;ref name="Puiu 2011, p. 102"/&gt; Following the peasant riots of [[Ilfov County]], put down by a Conservative administration, he asked for a formal inquiry—although he also supported the Conservative focus on a [[balanced budget]].&lt;ref&gt;Puiu (2011), pp. 107, 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Conservative reports, in 1887 the Faction still existed as a distinct chapter within the PNL "collective", kept alive by the [[spoils system]] and working to "falsify public opinion" on the side of the PNL.&lt;ref&gt;Tutoveanu, "Din districte. Alegerile de la Bêrlad, IV", in ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', June 2 (14), 1887, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Ionescu was an unaffiliated deputy, but loosely associated with [[George Panu]]'s [[Radical Party (Romania)|Radicals]]; his own son Eugen had joined ''Junimea''{{'}}s parliamentary group.&lt;ref&gt;"Votul fortificațiunilor", in ''[[România Liberă]]'', April 6 (18), 1889, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Ionescu Sr eventually joined the PNL in 1890, after which his political involvement was reduced to occasional speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Gafița, pp. 103–107&lt;/ref&gt; Like Eugen, who also joined the PNL, Ionescu remained essentially an outsider, "free and independent" within the party.&lt;ref name="Puiu 2010, p. 227"/&gt; In contrast, Holban, who still regarded himself as the Factionalist leader,&lt;ref&gt;Scurtu, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; crossed the floor and, by 1894, was one of the Conservative bosses in Iași—alongside Sturdza and ''Junimists'' such as Pogor and the Negruzzis.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Șuțu, ''Iașii de odinioară, I'', pp. 1–4, 8, 14, 120–121. Iași: Tipografia Lumina Moldovei, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, Hasdeu wrote the Faction's epitaph, noting that it had burned its "rather short fuse", whereas ''Junimea'', being able to canvass outside Moldavia, "lasted longer."&lt;ref&gt;Hasdeu &amp; Eliade, pp. 301–302&lt;/ref&gt;

Until September 2012, he was [[professor]] of Arabic and Islamic studies and the holder of the M.S. Sofia Chair in Arabic Studies at the [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. A scholar of religion, philosophy, and Arabic and Islamic literature and culture, his fields of specialization include [[Qur'an|Qur'anic studies]], [[Islamic philosophy|Arabic philosophy]], Christian- and Judeo-Arabic thought, and [[Islam]] in modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/htc/dxh/bios.htm|title=Conference Participant Biography|publisher=MIT }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMffGQKgJ9EC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=georges+tamer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NfeiNHHwtq&amp;sig=1DCVcvDmybg4JfhRWHaMRDrwvhQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iXKfTO_mK-aznAfm4q39DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=georges%20tamer&amp;f=false|title=Excerpt from a text on Kierkegaard research|publisher=Google }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has previously taught at the [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität Berlin]], the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|University of Erlangen-Nürnberg]], and the [[Central European University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/tagungsberichte/id=1684&amp;view=pdf|title=Islam through Jewish Eyes, Judaism through Muslim Eyes|publisher=Free University of Berlin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://staff.aub.edu.lb/~webybult/29.html|title=Archived edition of vol.48-49 (2000/2001) of al-Abhath: Journal of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, American University of Beirut|publisher=American University of Beirut }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and scholarly activity==
{{Unreferenced section|date= July 2017}}

Infected by [[poliomyelitis|polio]] as an infant in [[Lebanon]], Tamer was unable to attend elementary school and relied on [[autodidactic]] learning and private tutoring.  After attending high school in Lebanon for one year, Tamer moved to [[Germany]] where he studied philosophy, sociology and theology in [[Frankfurt]] ''inter alios'' with [[Jürgen Habermas]].  He obtained his MA in Philosophy from the Freie Universität Berlin in 1995 and was granted a Ph.D. in Philosophy in 2000.  He completed his [[habilitation]] in Islamic Studies at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg in 2007.

Tamer is a highly productive researcher throughout Europe, the United States, and the Middle East, having taken part in a number of research bodies and [[:wikt:colloquium|colloquia]] attached to institutes of higher education.  These include the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton University|Princeton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hs.ias.edu/05-06memlist.htm |title=Members of the School of Historical Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, 2005-2006 |publisher=Princeton University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821223608/http://www.hs.ias.edu/05-06memlist.htm |archivedate=2010-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Working Group on Modernity and Islam at the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin|Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin]].  He has planned and hosted interdisciplinary conferences on [[Maimonides]], [[humor]] in Arabic culture, migration in Germany, and, most recently, on the influential Muslim thinker [[al-Ghazali]].

A member of the [[Antiochian Orthodox Church]], Tamer founded a parish in Berlin.  He has participated in several ecumenical activities and [[interfaith dialogue]] groups in Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4527">'''Giovanna Borradori''' is Professor of Philosophy and Media Studies at [[Vassar College]]. Borradori is a specialist in [[Social and political theory]], [[Aesthetics]], and the philosophy of [[terrorism]]. A crucial focus of her work is fostering new avenues of communication between rival philosophical lineages, including the analytical and Continental traditions, [[liberalism]] and [[communitarianism]], as well as [[deconstruction]] and [[Critical Theory]]. To invigorate this exchange, she pioneered the scholarly interview as a new philosophical genre.

== Writings == 
In her anthology, ''Recoding Metaphysics: The New Italian Philosophy,'' Borradori presented late 20th-century Italian thinkers, such as [[Gianni Vattimo]], [[Massimo Cacciari]], [[Mario Perniola]],and [[Emanuele Severino]], to the American audience. In ''The American Philosopher: Conversations with Quine, Davidson, Putnam, Nozick, Danto, Rorty, Cavell, MacIntyre, Kuhn,'' she pressed her interlocutors to reflect on their relation to history, the weight of tradition in philosophy, and their encounters with [[pragmatism]] and [[logical positivism]]. ''The American Philosopher'' was one of the first critical examinations of the historical and institutional context in which contemporary American philosophy operates.

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], Borradori became a strong voice in the study of terrorism from a philosophical perspective. Her latest book, ''Philosophy in a Time of Terror: Dialogues with [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Jacques Derrida]],'' seeks to evaluate the full philosophical and political significance of 9/11 in conversation with two important European thinkers. Overcoming their historical enmity, Habermas and Derrida appear in her book side by side for the first time in their lives. Borradori's book opened the way for their critical collaboration on the public sphere, which continued with a declaration of support for the anti-war demonstrations of February 15, 2003. Entitled, "February 15, or, What Binds Europeans Together: Plea for a Common Foreign Policy, Beginning in Core Europe," their joint statement appeared simultaneously in major European newspapers and was later published in "[[Old Europe, New Europe, Core Europe]]" (Verso, 2005).

In ''Philosophy in a Time of Terror'', Borradori asserts that militant religious [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] explicitly reject [[secularization]] and [[modernity]], which constitute the conceptual foundations of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. This leads Borradori to claim that an appropriate response to 9/11 must reach "as far as a critical reassessment of the validity of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project" (10).

While Habermas's allegiance to Enlightenment principles has been uncontroversial, Derrida's explicit defense of them is an important achievement of this book. Another remarkable result is to have identified [[Immanuel Kant]] as a key reference point in the post-9/11 world. Guided by Borradori's questions, Habermas and Derrida discuss their different interpretations of Kant's legacy, both agreeing, however, with the crux of his political philosophy: the legitimacy of international legal and political institutions as a condition for global justice.

He is a senior disciple of the  [[Hsuan Hua]], and is currently the director of the [[Berkeley Buddhist Monastery]], a branch monastery of the [[Dharma Realm Buddhist Association]]. He is probably best known for a pilgrimage he made for two years and six months from 1977-1979. Called a ''three steps, one bow'' pilgrimage, Heng Sure and his companion Heng Chau (Martin Verhoeven), bowed from South Pasadena to Ukiah, California, a distance of 800 miles, seeking world peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz-arts-entertainment-lifestyles/literature-poetry-book-reviews/6153-the-bowers-that-be.html|title = The Bowers That Be|last = Harrison|first = Anne-Marie|date = December 17, 2014|work = Good Times|access-date = August 20, 2015|via = |publication-place = [[Santa Cruz, California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FINDING MY RELIGION / Buddhist pastor Heng Sure talks about his 2½-year pilgrimage up the California coast|url = http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/FINDING-MY-RELIGION-Buddhist-pastor-Heng-Sure-3175631.php|accessdate = 2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Toledo, Ohio]], he attended [[DeVilbiss High School (Toledo, Ohio)|DeVilbiss High School]], Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan, and later attended the [[University of California at Berkeley]] from 1971-1976. During his time at the university, Heng Sure was active in theatre. At an early age, Heng Sure learned Chinese from studying the language in high school and by means of his sister, who worked at the [[U.S. Information Agency]]. After receiving his masters in Oriental languages, he met his teacher, Hsuan Hua, who would later ordain him in 1976 at the [[City of Ten Thousand Buddhas]], as "Heng Sure" a Dharma name which means "Constantly Real." 
Heng Sure earned an MA degree in Oriental Languages from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1976 and a PhD in Religion from the Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, in 2003.

Heng Sure currently gives lectures in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to the public and through [[webcasts]]. Heng Sure also gives lectures in many parts of the world on various subjects, such as the sutras and [[veganism]]. He is also an accomplished musician and guitarist.

In 2008, Heng Sure published his first [http://www.dharmaradio.org/paramita/index.htm music CD "Paramita: American Buddhist Folk Songs"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16392">'''Information ethics''' has been defined as "the branch of ethics that focuses on the relationship between the creation, organization, dissemination, and use of information, and the ethical standards and moral codes governing human conduct in society".&lt;ref&gt;Joan, Reitz M. "Information Ethics." Online Dictionary For Library And Information Science. N.p., 2010. Web. &lt;http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_i.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''information ethics'' was first coined by Robert Hauptman and used in the book ''Ethical challenges in librarianship''. It examines the morality that comes from information as a resource, a product, or as a target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Froehlich|first1=Thomas|title=A brief history of information ethics|url=http://bid.ub.edu/13froel2.htm|website=bid.ub.edu|publisher=Kent State University|date=December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a critical framework for considering moral issues concerning informational [[privacy]], moral agency (e.g. whether artificial agents may be moral), new environmental issues (especially how agents should behave in the [[infosphere]]), problems arising from the life-cycle (creation, collection, recording, distribution, processing, etc.) of information (especially ownership and copyright, [[digital divide]], and [[digital rights]]). It is very vital to understand that librarians, archivists, information professionals among others, really understand the importance of knowing how to disseminate proper information as well as being responsible with their actions when addressing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carbo|first1=Toni|last2=Almagno|first2=Stephen|title=Information Ethics: The Duty, Privilege and Challenge of Educating Information Professionals|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/8351/librarytrendsv49i3j_opt.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information ethics has evolved to relate to a range of fields such as [[computer ethics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Floridi |title=Information Ethics: On the Theoretical Foundations of Computer Ethics |journal=Ethics and Information Technology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=37–56 |first1=Luciano |date=1999 |url=http://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/~floridi/pdf/ieotfce.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109054139/http://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/~floridi/pdf/ieotfce.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; medical ethics, journalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Floridi|first1=Luciano|title=Information ethics, its nature and scope|journal=ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society|date=June 2005|volume=35|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[philosophy of information]].

Dilemmas regarding the life of information are becoming increasingly important in a society that is defined as "the information society". The explosion of so much technology has brought information ethics to a forefront in ethical considerations.  Information transmission and literacy are essential concerns in establishing an ethical foundation that promotes fair, equitable, and responsible practices. Information ethics broadly examines issues related to ownership, access, privacy, security, and community.  It is also concerned with relational issues such as "the relationship between information and the good of society, the relationship between information providers and the consumers of information".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Library and Information Center Management|last=Moran|first=Barbara A.|last2=Stueart|first2=Robert D.|last3=Morner|first3=Claudia J.|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=2013|isbn=|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=321|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information technology affects common issues such as copyright protection, intellectual freedom, accountability, privacy, and security. Many of these issues are difficult or impossible to resolve due to fundamental tensions between Western moral philosophies (based on rules, democracy, individual rights, and personal freedoms) and the traditional Eastern cultures (based on relationships, hierarchy, collective responsibilities, and social harmony).&lt;ref&gt;[[M.G. Martinsons and D. Ma]] (2009) [http://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/vol10/iss11/2/ "Sub-Cultural Differences in Information Ethics across China: Focus On Chinese Management Generation Gaps"], ''Journal of the Association for Information Systems'' 10.11, 957-973.&lt;/ref&gt; The multi-faceted dispute between [[Google]] and the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] reflects some of these fundamental tensions.

Professional codes offer a basis for making ethical decisions and applying ethical solutions to situations involving information provision and use which reflect an organization's commitment to responsible information service. Evolving information formats and needs require continual reconsideration of ethical principles and how these codes are applied.  Considerations regarding information ethics influence "personal decisions, professional practice, and [[public policy]]".&lt;ref&gt;E. Elrod and M. Smith (2005). "Information Ethics", in ''Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics'', ed. by [[Carl Mitcham]]. Vol. 2: D-K (1004-1011). Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, ethical analysis must provide a framework to take into consideration "many, diverse domains" (ibid.) regarding how information is distributed.

The main, peer-reviewed, academic journals reporting on information ethics are the ''[[Journal of the Association for Information Systems]]'', the flagship publication of the [[Association for Information Systems]], and [http://www.springerlink.com/content/1572-8439/ ''Ethics and Information Technology''], published by Springer.

==History==

The field of information ethics has a relatively short but progressive history having been recognized in the United States for nearly 20 years.&lt;ref name=brief&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Froehlich |first1=Thomas |title=A Brief History of Information Ethics |journal=Textos Universitaris de Biblioteconomia i Documentació |issn=1575-5886 |publisher=Universitat de Barcelona |volume=13 |date=December 2004 |url=http://bid.ub.edu/13froel2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the field are in librarianship though it has now expanded to the consideration of ethical issues in other domains including computer science, the internet, media, journalism, management information systems, and business.&lt;ref name=brief/&gt;

Evidence of scholarly work on this subject can be traced to the 1980s, when an article authored by Barbara J. Kostrewski and Charles Oppenheim and published in the ''[[Journal of Information Science]]'', discussed issues relating to the field including confidentiality, information biases, and quality control.&lt;ref name=brief/&gt; Another scholar, Robert Hauptman, has also written extensively about information ethics in the library field and founded the ''[[Journal of Information Ethics]]'' in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slais.ubc.ca/courses/libr500/09-10-wt2/www/M_Kerr-WWW/index.htm|title=Introduction|last1=Kerr|first1=Michael|date=29 March 2010|website=Ethics And Information Management In The 21st Century|publisher=University of British Columbia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331012412/http://www.slais.ubc.ca/courses/libr500/09-10-wt2/www/M_Kerr-WWW/index.htm|archivedate=31 March 2012|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Censorship ==
[[Censorship]] is an issue commonly involved in the discussion of information ethics because it describes the inability to access or express opinions or information based on the belief it is bad for others to view this opinion or information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathiesen|first=Kay|date=2008|title=Censorship and Access to Expression|url=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~pchatter/2011/pepi/The_Handbook_of_Information_and_Computer_Ethics.pdf|journal=The Handbook of Information and Computer Ethics|volume=|pages=573–585|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources that are commonly censored include books, articles, speeches, art work, data, music and photos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Censorship can be perceived both as ethical and non-ethical in the field of information ethics.

Those who believe censorship is ethical say the practice prevents readers from being exposed to offensive and objectionable material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Topics such as sexism, racism, homophobia, and anti-semitism are present in public works and are widely seen as unethical in the public eye.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duthie|first=Fiona|date=July 2013|title=Libraries and the Ethics of Censorship|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00049670.2010.10735994|journal=Australian Library Journal|volume=53|pages=85–94|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is concern regarding the exposure of these topics to the world, especially the young generation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Australian Library Journal states proponents for censorship in libraries, the practice of librarians deciphering which books/ resources to keep in their libraries, argue the act of censorship is an ethical way to provide information to the public that is considered morally sound, allowing positive ethics instead of negative ethics to be dispersed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to the same journal, librarians have an "ethical duty" to protect the minds, particularly young people, of those who read their books through the lens of censorship to prevent the readers from adopting the unethical ideas and behaviors portrayed in the books.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, others in the field of information ethics argue the practice of censorship is unethical because it fails to provide all available information to the community of readers. British philosopher John Stuart Mill argued censorship is unethical because it goes directly against the moral concept of [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fallis|first=Don|date=2007|title=Information Ethics for 21st Century Library Professionals|url=https://arizona.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10150/105520/fallislibraryhitech.pdf;jsessionid=35BF2DD362188EBF8A902CBD7F146BC6?sequence=1|journal=Library Hi Tech|volume=25|pages=2–12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mill believes humans are unable to have true beliefs when information is withheld from the population via censorship and acquiring true beliefs without censorship leads to greater happiness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to this argument, true beliefs and happiness (of which both concepts are considered ethical) cannot be obtained through the practice of censorship. Librarians and others who disperse information to the public also face the dilemma of the ethics of censorship through the argument that censorship harms students and is morally wrong because they are unable to know the full extent of knowledge available to the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The debate of information ethics in censorship was highly contested when schools removed information about evolution from libraries and curriculums due to the topic conflicting with religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this case, advocates against ethics in censorship argue it is more ethical to include multiple sources information on a subject, such as creation, to allow the reader to learn and decipher their beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Security and Privacy ==
Ethical concerns regarding international security, surveillance, and the right to privacy are on the rise.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pretorius|first=Joelien|date=April 2003|title=Ethics and International Security in the Information Age|url=|journal=Defense &amp; Security Analysis|volume=19| issue =  2|pages=165–175|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issues of security and privacy commonly overlap in the field of information, due to the interconnectedness of online research and the development of [[Information technology|Information Technology (IT)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kernaghan|first=Kenneth|date=June 2014|title=Digital dilemmas: Values, ethics, and information technology|url=|journal=Canadian Public Administration|volume=57| issue =  2|pages=295–317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the areas surrounding security and privacy are identity theft, online economic transfers, medical records, and state security.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quigley|first=Marian|date=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Information and Ethics Secuirty|url=|journal=Information Science Reference|volume=|pages=660|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies, organizations, and institutions use databases to store, organize, and distribute user's information—with or without their knowledge.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Medical Records ===
The more recent trend of medical records is to digitize them. The sensitive information secured within medical records makes security measure vitally important.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stahl, Doherty, Shaw, Janicke|first=Bernd Carsten, Neil F., Mark, Helge|date=November 2013|title=Critical Theory as an Approach to the Ethics of Information Security|url=|journal=Springer Science+Business Media|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethical concern of medical records is great within the context of emergency wards, where any patient records can be accessed at all times.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Within an emergency ward, patient medical records need to be available for quick access; however, this means that all medical records can be accessed at any moment within emergency wards with or without the patient present.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== International Security ===
Warfare has also changed the security of countries within the 21st Century. After the events of 9-11 and other terrorism attacks on civilians, surveillance by states raises ethical concerns of the individual privacy of citizens. The [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act 2001]] is a prime example of such concerns. Many other countries, especially European nations within the current climate of terrorism, is looking for a balancing between stricter security and surveillance, and not committing the same ethical concerns associated with the USA Patriot Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levi, Wall|first=Michael, David S.|date=June 2004|title=Technologies, Security, and Privacy in the Post-9/11 European Information Society|url=|journal=Journal of Law and Society|volume=31| issue =  2|pages=194–220|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; International security is moving to towards the trends of cybersecurity and unmanned systems, which involve the military application of IT.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Ethical concerns of political entities regarding [[information warfare]] include the unpredictability of response, difficulty differentiating civilian and military targets, and conflict between state and non-state actors.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

[[File:The poet James Beattie as depicted on the Scott Monument.JPG|thumb|260px|The poet James Beattie as depicted on the [[Scott Monument]]]]
'''James Beattie''' [[FRSE]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|t|i}}; 25 October 1735 – 18 August 1803) was a Scottish poet, [[moral philosopher|moralist]] and philosopher.

==Career==
He became schoolmaster of the parish of Fordoun in 1753. He took the position of usher at the grammar-school of Aberdeen in 1758.

In 1760, he was, to his surprise, appointed Professor of [[moral philosophy]] at [[Marischal College]] (later part of [[Aberdeen University]]) as a result of the influence exerted by his close friend, Robert Arbuthnot of Haddo.  &lt;ref&gt;A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen, Robert Chambers, 1835&lt;/ref&gt;In the following year he published a volume of poems, ''The Judgment of Paris'' (1765), which attracted attention. The two works, however, which brought him most fame were ''[[An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth]]'', and his poem of ''The Minstrel''. The ''Essay'', intended as an answer to [[David Hume]], had great immediate success, and led to an introduction to the King, a pension of £200, and the degree of [[LL.D.]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. The first book of ''The Minstrel'' was published in 1771 and the second in 1774, and constitutes his true title to remembrance, winning him the praise of [[Samuel Johnson]]. It contains much beautiful descriptive writing.

Beattie was prominent in arguing against the institution of [[slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= A North East Story: Abolishing the Slave Trade| url =http://www.abdn.ac.uk/slavery/7p1.htm | accessdate = 2009-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; notably in his ''Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth'' (1770), and in ''Elements of Moral Science'' (1790-1793) where he used the case of [[Dido Belle]] to argue the mental capacity of blacks.&lt;ref&gt;page 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Beattie was an amateur cellist and member of the Aberdeen Musical Society. He considered questions of music philosophy in his essay ''On Poetry and Music'' (written 1762, published 1776), which was republished several times and translated into French in 1798. His poem "The Hermit" was set to music by [[Tommaso Giordani]] (1778).&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=James Beattie|author=David Johnson|access-date=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beattie was co-founder of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1783.

==Personal life==
James Beattie was born the son of a shopkeeper and small farmer at [[Laurencekirk]] in the [[Kincardineshire|Mearns]], and educated at Marischal, graduating in 1753.

Beattie underwent much domestic sorrow in his later years, which broke down his own health and spirits. His wife, Mary ''née'' Dunn, whom he had married in 1767, went mad and was committed to a Musselburgh asylum. His two promising sons both died: James Hay in 1790 aged 22 from "nervous atrophy", and Montagu in 1796 aged 18 after a short illness.  

He relinquished his duties at Marischal in 1797. That year he became afflicted with rheumatism, and in 1799 he had a stroke of palsy. He died in Aberdeen in 1803 and is buried there in St Nicholas' Churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/beattie_james.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia Britannica, Or Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature, Volume 4, page 477&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A biographical sketch, ''An Account of the Life of James Beattie, LL.D.'', was published in 1804 by [[Alexander Bower]].&lt;ref name=DNB00&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Bower, Alexander|last=Sutton|first=Charles William|authorlink=Charles William Sutton|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Robert Burns]] informed Mrs Frances Dunlop in a letter that the idea of using [[Coila (muse)|Coila]] as the name of his poetic muse first came to him from Beattie's use of a muse named 'Scota' in his Scots language poem of 1768 titled ''To Mr Alexander at Lochlee.''

Beattie is one of the sixteen Scottish poets and writers depicted on the [[Scott Monument]] on [[Princes Street]] in [[Edinburgh]]. He appears on the left side of the east face.

'''Josef Zezulka''' (1912–1992) (sometimes translated as Joseph Zezulka) was a Czech [[philosopher]], [[Alternative medicine|healer]] and the founder of the biotronics discipline. He is the author of many philosophical works. BYTÍ - EXISTENCE - A Philosophy for Life is his most famous work. The work encompasses specific topics such as the birth of space and its life, evolution of a being, karma, vegetarianism and life energetics.

==Biography==
''Excerpted from the book The Life of Přinašeč - a Bringer &lt;ref&gt;Tomáš Pfeiffer. Život přinašeče [The Life of Přinašeč - a Bringer]. Dimenze 2+2 Praha, 2012,  http://www.dub.cz/cs/zivot-prinasece.php&lt;/ref&gt;''
Josef Zezulka was born in Brno on 30 March 1912 but he lived in [[Prague]] all his life. He ran a sweet shop before the Second World War. During the war he was actively involved in the Western resistance, and after the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état his sweet shop was confiscated. He worked as an accountant in the [[National Museum (Prague)|National Museum]] and later, as a result of further persecution, as a museum guard. However, he is well known for his other activities – the life philosophy of Existence and, as part of it, biotronics - both initiated by him at Easter 1945 when he experienced a kind of awakening, a state of open consciousness, and thereupon he practised and developed them both for all his lifetime.

In 1968, with the assistance of the Czechoslovak Minister of Health, Mr. Vlček, biotronics got closer to its incorporation within the national healthcare system but all those efforts were interrupted by the August 1968 occupation by the Warsaw Pact allied forces. In 1982 Josef Zezulka conducted research into biotronics treatment in the Vimperk hospital. The research was managed by the Psychoenergetic Laboratory of Professor Kahuda. Josef Zezulka practised healing mainly in his own flat where people used to go and seek help. He practised healing for more than 40 years.

His lectures on the philosophy of Existence were more or less secret (the communist Czechoslovakia period was not favourable for such activities) and numerous lectures were held in various private flats. One of the exceptions was the International Congress on Psychotronic Research held in Prague in 1973, where he gave a very successful public speech. At the same time he was secretly writing the teaching down while his friends were transcribing and making copies of his books and essays. The essays were also published in western countries within various publications.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Krippner, Alberto Villoldo: The Realms of Healing, 3rd ed. (Celestial Arts Press) (rev. ed. 1977) {{ISBN|0-89087-474-3}} pp. 177-195 https://books.google.cz/books?hl=cs&amp;id=uXsoAQAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=zezulka&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Krippner: Psychoenergetic Systems: The Interface of Consciousness, Energy and Matter (Gordon &amp; Breach) 1979 pp. 131-133 https://books.google.cz/books?hl=cs&amp;id=exp_AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=stanley+Krippner%3A+Psychoenergetic+Systems+google+books&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=zezulka&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophical-religious books were published only after 1989. He died in 1992.

==Josef Zezulka Biotronics==
It was Josef Zezulka who conceived and fulfilled the word ''biotronics'' as one of the [[Alternative medicine|healing]] forms.&lt;ref name="zivotni-energie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zivotni-energie.cz/josef-zezulka.html|publisher=zivotni-energie.cz|title=Josef Zezulka &amp;#124; ZIVOTNI ENERGIE|accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zezulka, humans are made of three basic components: matter, spirit and vitality.&lt;ref&gt;ZEZULKA Josef, Bytí životní filosofie [BYTÍ - EXISTENCE - A Philosophy for Life], Dimenze 2+2, 2012, p. 22,  http://www.dub.cz/cs/josef-zezulka-byti-zivotni-filosofie-online-kniha.php&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases are subject to the same categorization. Zezulka’s biotronics pertains to complementing and harmonization of the vital body forces in particular. He claims that every human has a basic quota of body forces that are necessary for life.&lt;ref&gt;collected by Tomáš Pfeiffer, Zezulkova Biotronika [Zezulka’s Biotronics], Dimenze 2+2, 2012,  http://www.dub.cz/cs/zezulkova-biotronika-online-kniha.php&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, each organ and cell has its own force system. All these systems are interlinked, and the healer-biotronic focuses healing on those force systems when they are disrupted or harmed. Zezulka practised healing completely free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;https://theses.cz/id/aah71i/fenomn_litelstv_-_cd_verze.pdf, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; His disciple and entrusted successor Tomáš Pfeiffer says that biotronics does not replace medicine&lt;ref name="dub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dub.cz/cs/biotronika-rozhovor-s-tomasem-pfeifferem.php|publisher=dub.cz|title=BIOTRONIKA - rozhovor s Tomášem Pfeifferem|accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but wants to take care of a vital forces area in which conventional medicine is failing. Currently, Petition for Support of Biotronics is being carried out; it is aimed at having biotronics accepted into the public healthcare system&lt;ref name="dub2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dub.cz/en/petition-for-support-of-biotronics.php|publisher=dub.cz|title=Petition for support of biotronics|accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; – which is what also Josef Zezulka was striving for.

==Filozofie Bytí [Philosophy of Existence]==
''Excerpted from the book BYTÍ - EXISTENCE - A Philosophy for Life &lt;ref&gt;ZEZULKA Josef, Bytí životní filosofie [BYTÍ - EXISTENCE - A Philosophy for Life], Dimenze 2+2, 2012, p. 22,  http://www.dub.cz/cs/josef-zezulka-byti-zivotni-filosofie-online-kniha.php&lt;/ref&gt; ''

His philosophy of Existence encompasses a wide range of philosophical and religious phenomena. It also deals with [[cosmology]] and [[biophysics]]. The Podstata (God) from which everything that exists emerged by dividing. This gave rise to matter, spirit, and vitality that permeates the first two, bringing them to life. Matter, spirit and vitality are composed of four basic elements which are centripetal force, centrifugal force, heat and cold; Josef Zezulka calls this process and division The Creative Four. All is subject to the same laws of nature. He sees cycles, oscillation in everything – in the breath of a man, in the breath of the planet (cycles of the seasons), but also in the so-called breath of universe where four phases cyclically rotate. We are currently in the centripetal-cold phase during which everything is cooling down. In this phase matter and spirit permeated through each other and therewith the first being emerged, the first ‘I am’.

A being develops, it reincarnates into higher and higher species. The process of rebirth ([[reincarnation]]) is an integral part of the teaching as well as the so-called Law of Reflection (Zákon odrazu) which is known as [[Karma]] by the people of India. The law states that whatever the being does, it receives the same back, usually in its next life. Over time more and more new evolutionary species emerge. The particularity of the concept is that it does not end with humans, however, he claims that after humans a higher species will emerge, then even a higher one and so forth and so on. The whole cycle shall be completed by merging with God – Podstata. It also emphasises the planetary cycles, e.g. the [[Platonic year]] that lasts about 24,000 years – on the ridge of which a crisis period apparently rises; we currently live in one such period, and this is why there are those disturbances and terror in the world.

[[Vegetarianism]] is strongly emphasised in the teaching, here the term ''You shall not kill'' is extended to all animals. An integral part is the contemplation on the meaning of life which, according to Josef Zezulka, is ''To be a positive component of the Creative Work''. Time represents another variable he describes as follows:  there is in fact no time, everything still exists, persists. Only we, with our consciousness as we live our life, are firmly fixed to time. Furthermore, he divides the thinking into equal parts: belief (intuition) and knowledge (reason). It is a mistake to solely believe, it is a mistake to solely use reason. Ideal is the balance – [[kalokagathia]].

'''Józef Stanisław Tischner''' (12 March 1931 – 28 June 2000) was an eminent [[Poland|Polish]] [[priest]] and [[philosopher]]. The first chaplain of the [[trade union]], "[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]" (Polish ''Solidarność''), he was an exceptional [[moral authority]] and one of the most admired figures in Poland, both during and after the anti-communist uprising.

Tischner was born in [[Stary Sącz]] to a [[Góral]] family and grew up in the village Łopuszna in the south east of Poland. He studied at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]. In the 1970s he became an important writer of the opposition movement against the socialist government of the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. In 1980s he was considered the semi-official chaplain of the Solidarity movement, and was praised by [[Pope John Paul II]]. 

After the fall of communism in 1989, he continued preaching the importance of [[ethics]] in the new [[capitalism|capitalist]] Poland. In September 1999, Tischner received the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]], Poland's highest decoration.

Tischner remains a controversial figure to the Polish right-wing and Catholic episcopacy. He frequently criticized Polish religiousness by calling it as flat (shallow) as a pancake, he also accused the Polish clergy of being extremely conservative, engaged in politics and anti-Semitic.

Fellow of [[Collegium Invisibile]] as a professor of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.edu.pl/index.php?id=tutorzy&amp;kat=Czlonkowie |title=List of Fellows |publisher=ci.edu.pl |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Kraków]] on 28 June 2000. 

== Publications ==

Tischner wrote and published more than 600 articles and books.

His two main works, in which he explained his original philosophical concepts, are: 
*''The Philosophy of Drama (Filozofia dramatu)'' (1998) 
*''The Controversy over Human Existence (Spór o istnienie człowieka)'' (1998)

Most notable among his [[Góral]] themed works is:
*''A Goral History of Philosophy (Historia filozofii po góralsku)'' (1997)

'''Logic''' (from the {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λογική|λογική]]|logikḗ}}&lt;ref name="argumentative"/&gt;), originally meaning "the word" or "what is spoken", but coming to mean "thought" or "reason", is a subject concerned with the most general laws of [[truth]],&lt;ref&gt;Due to Frege, see the [[Definitions of logic]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now generally held to consist of the systematic study of the [[Logical form|form]] of [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[inference]]. A valid inference is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the inference and its [[consequent|conclusion]]. (In ordinary discourse, inferences may be signified by words such as ''therefore'', ''hence'', ''ergo'', and so on.)

There is no universal agreement as to the exact scope and subject matter of logic (see {{section link||Rival conceptions}}, below), but it has traditionally included the classification of arguments, the systematic exposition of the 'logical form' common to all valid arguments, the study of [[inference]], including [[fallacies]], and the study of [[semantics]], including [[paradox]]es.  Historically, logic has been studied in [[philosophy]] (since ancient times) and [[mathematics]] (since the mid-19th century), and recently logic has been studied in [[computer science]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], and other fields.

==Concepts==
{{rquote|right|Upon this first, and in one sense this sole, rule of reason, that in order to learn you must desire to learn, and in so desiring not be satisfied with what you already incline to capably think, there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy: Do not block the way of inquiry.|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], "First Rule of Logic"}}
The concept of [[logical form]] is central to logic. The validity of an argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content. Traditional [[syllogism|Aristotelian syllogistic logic]] and modern symbolic logic are examples of formal logic.
* '''[[Informal logic]]''' is the study of [[natural language]] [[Logical argument|arguments]]. The study of [[fallacies]] is an important branch of informal logic. Since much informal argument is not strictly speaking deductive, on some conceptions of logic, informal logic is not logic at all.  See 'Rival conceptions', below.
* '''[[Mathematical formalism|Formal logic]]''' is the study of [[inference]] with purely formal content. An inference possesses a ''purely formal content'' if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule, that is, a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. The works of [[Aristotle]] contain the earliest known formal study of logic. Modern formal logic follows and expands on Aristotle.&lt;ref name="The Basic Works"/&gt; In many definitions of logic, [[logical consequence|logical inference]] and inference with purely formal content are the same. This does not render the notion of informal logic vacuous, because no formal logic captures all of the nuances of natural language.
* '''[[Mathematical logic#Symbolic logic|Symbolic logic]]''' is the study of symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; Symbolic logic is often divided into two main branches: [[propositional logic]] and [[predicate logic]].
* '''[[Mathematical logic]]''' is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of [[model theory]], [[proof theory]], [[set theory]], and [[recursion theory]].

However, agreement on what logic is has remained elusive, and although the field of [[universal logic]] has studied the common structure of logics, in 2007 Mossakowski et al. commented that "it is embarrassing that there is no widely acceptable formal definition of 'a logic'".&lt;ref&gt;T. Mossakowski, [[Joseph Goguen|J. A. Goguen]], R. Diaconescu, A. Tarlecki, "What is a Logic?", [[Logica Universalis]] 2007 Birkhauser,  pp. 113–133.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical form===
{{main article|Logical form}}
Logic is generally considered '''formal''' when it analyzes and represents the ''form'' of any valid argument type. The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. Simply put, to formalize simply means to translate English sentences into the language of logic.

This is called showing the ''logical form'' of the argument. It is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical. It requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic (such as gender and declension, if the argument is in Latin), replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic (such as "but") with logical conjunctions like "and" and replacing ambiguous, or alternative logical expressions ("any", "every", etc.) with expressions of a standard type (such as "all", or the [[universal quantifier]] ∀).

Second, certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters. Thus, for example, the expression "all Ps are Qs" shows the logical form common to the sentences "all men are mortals", "all cats are carnivores", "all Greeks are philosophers", and so on.  The schema can further be condensed into the [[formula]] ''A(P,Q)'', where the letter ''A'' indicates the judgement 'all - are -'.

The importance of form was recognised from ancient times. Aristotle uses variable letters to represent valid inferences in ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', leading [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] to say that the introduction of variables was "one of Aristotle's greatest inventions".&lt;ref name="Aristotle's syllogistic from the standpoint of modern formal logic"/&gt; According to the followers of Aristotle (such as [[Ammonius Saccas|Ammonius]]), only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, not those given in concrete terms. The concrete terms "man", "mortal", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders ''P'', ''Q'', ''R'', which were called the "matter" (Greek ''hyle'') of the inference.

There is a big difference between the kinds of formulas seen in traditional term logic and the [[predicate calculus]] that is the fundamental advance of modern logic.  The formula ''A(P,Q)'' (all Ps are Qs) of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex formula &lt;math&gt;\forall x. (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))&lt;/math&gt; in predicate logic, involving the logical connectives for [[universal quantification]] and [[material conditional|implication]] rather than just the predicate letter ''A'' and using variable arguments &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; where traditional logic uses just the term letter ''P''.  With the complexity comes power, and the advent of the predicate calculus inaugurated revolutionary growth of the subject.

=== Semantics ===
{{main article|Semantics of logic}}

The validity of an argument depends upon the meaning or ''semantics'' of the sentences that make it up.

Aristotle's [[Organon]], especially ''[[On Interpretation]]'', gives a cursory outline of semantics which the [[scholastic logic]]ians, particularly in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, developed into a complex and sophisticated theory, called [[Supposition Theory]].  This showed how the truth of simple sentences, expressed schematically, depend on how the terms 'supposit' or ''stand for'' certain extra-linguistic items.  For example, in part II of his [[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]], [[William of Ockham]] presents a comprehensive account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of simple sentences, in order to show which arguments are valid and which are not.  Thus "every A is B' is true if and only if there is something for which 'A' stands, and there is nothing for which 'A' stands, for which 'B' does not also stand." &lt;ref&gt;''Summa Logicae'' Part II c.4 transl. as ''Ockam's Theory of Propositions'', A. Freddoso and H. Schuurman, St Augustine's Press 1998, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern logic defined semantics purely as a relation between ideas.  [[Antoine Arnauld]] in the [[Port Royal Logic]], says that 'after conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas, and, finding that some belong together and some do not, we unite or separate them. This is called ''affirming'' or ''denying'', and in general ''judging''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnauld, ''Logic or the Art of Thinking'' Part 2 Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus truth and falsity are no more than the agreement or disagreement of ideas.  This suggests obvious difficulties, leading [[John Locke|Locke]] to distinguish between 'real' truth, when our ideas have 'real existence' and 'imaginary' or 'verbal' truth, where ideas like harpies or centaurs exist only in the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, 1690.  [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], IV. v. 1-8)&lt;/ref&gt;  This view ([[psychologism]]) was taken to the extreme in the nineteenth century, and is generally held by modern logicians to signify a low point in the decline of logic before the twentieth century.

Modern semantics is in some ways closer to the medieval view, in rejecting such psychological truth-conditions.  However, the introduction of [[quantifier (logic)|quantification]], needed to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]], rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics.  The main modern approach is ''model-theoretic semantics'', based on [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[semantic theory of truth]].  The approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of [[interpretation function]]s from them to some predefined [[domain of discourse]]: an interpretation of [[first-order predicate logic]] is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of [[individual]]s, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values "true" and "false".  Model-theoretic semantics is one of the fundamental concepts of [[model theory]].  Modern semantics also admits rival approaches, such as the [[proof-theoretic semantics]] that associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences, an approach that ultimately derives from the work of [[Gerhard Gentzen]] on [[structural proof theory]] and is heavily influenced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy, especially his aphorism "meaning is use".

===Inference===
''Inference'' is not to be confused with ''implication''.  An implication is a sentence of the form 'If p then q', and can be true or false.  [[Stoic logic|The Stoic logician]] [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo of Megara]] was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true.  An inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form 'p therefore q'.  An inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid.  However, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication 'if p then q' is ''true'', the inference 'p therefore q' is ''valid''.  This was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo, who said that the implication 'if it is day, it is night' is true only at night, so the inference 'it is day, therefore it is night' is valid in the night, but not in the day.

The theory of inference (or 'consequences') was systematically developed in medieval times by logicians such as [[William of Ockham]] and [[Walter Burley]].  It is uniquely medieval, though it has its origins in Aristotle's [[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]] and [[Boethius]]' ''De Syllogismis hypotheticis''.  This is why many terms in logic are Latin.  For example, the rule that licenses the move from the implication 'if p then q' plus the assertion of its antecedent p, to the assertion of the consequent q is known as [[modus ponens]] (or 'mode of positing').  Its Latin formulation is 'Posito antecedente ponitur consequens'.  The Latin formulations of many other rules such as 'ex falso quodlibet' (anything follows from a falsehood), 'reductio ad absurdum' (disproof by showing the consequence is absurd) also date from this period.

However, the theory of consequences, or of the so-called '[[hypothetical syllogism]]' was never fully integrated into the theory of the 'categorical syllogism'.  This was partly because of the resistance to reducing the categorical judgment 'Every S is P' to the so-called hypothetical judgment 'if anything is S, it is P'.  The first was thought to imply 'some S is P', the second was not, and as late as 1911 in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] article on Logic, we find the Oxford logician T.H. Case arguing against Sigwart's and Brentano's modern analysis of the universal proposition.

===Logical systems===
{{main article|Formal system}}
A formal system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction. It consists of an alphabet, a language over the alphabet to construct sentences, and a rule for deriving sentences. Among the important properties that [[logical system]]s can have are:
* '''[[Consistency proof|Consistency]]''', which means that no theorem of the system contradicts another.&lt;ref name="Bergmann, Merrie 2009"/&gt;
* '''[[Validity (logic)|Validity]]''', which means that the system's rules of proof never allow a false inference from true premises.
* '''[[completeness (logic)|Completeness]]''', which means that if a formula is true, it can be proven, i.e. is a ''theorem'' of the system.
* '''[[Soundness]]''', meaning that if any formula is a theorem of the system, it is true. This is the converse of completeness. (Note that in a distinct philosophical use of the term, an argument is sound  when it is both valid and its premises are true).&lt;ref&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ Validity and Soundness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some logical systems do not have all four properties. As an example, [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] show that sufficiently complex formal systems of arithmetic cannot be consistent and complete;&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt; however, first-order predicate logics not extended by specific [[axiom]]s to be arithmetic formal systems with equality can be complete and consistent.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Mathematical Logic"/&gt;

===Logic and rationality===
{{main article|Logic and rationality}}
{{confusing|section|date=May 2016}}
As the study of argument is of clear importance to the reasons that we hold things to be true, logic is of essential importance to [[rationality]].  Here we have defined logic to be "the systematic study of the form of arguments"; the reasoning behind argument is of several sorts, but only some of these arguments fall under the aegis of logic proper.

[[Deductive reasoning]] concerns the [[logical consequence]] of given premises and is the form of reasoning most closely connected to logic. On a narrow conception of logic (see below) logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most of what is called informal logic from the discipline.

There are other forms of reasoning that are rational but that are generally not taken to be part of logic.  These include [[inductive reasoning]], which covers forms of inference that move from collections of particular judgements to universal judgements, and [[abductive reasoning]],&lt;ref name=abduction&gt;On [[abductive reasoning]], see:
* Magnani, L. ''Abduction, Reason, and Science: Processes of Discovery and Explanation''. Kluwer Academic Plenum Publishers, New York, 2001. xvii. 205 pages. Hardcover, {{isbn|0-306-46514-0}}.

* Bunt, H. &amp; Black, W. ''Abduction, Belief and Context in Dialogue: Studies in Computational Pragmatics''. (Natural Language Processing, 1.) John Benjamins, Amsterdam &amp; Philadelphia, 2000. vi. 471 pages. Hardcover, {{isbn|90-272-4983-0}}, {{ISBN|1556197942}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a form of inference that goes from observation to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data (observation) and seeks to explain relevant evidence. The American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) first introduced the term as "guessing".&lt;ref name=guess&gt;See [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/abduction Abduction] and [http://www.commens.org/dictionary/term/retroduction Retroduction] at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', and see Peirce's papers:
* "On the Logic of drawing History from Ancient Documents especially from Testimonies" (1901), ''Collected Papers'' v. 7, paragraph 219.
* "PAP" ["Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism"], MS 293 c. 1906, ''New Elements of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 319–320.
* A Letter to F. A. Woods (1913), ''Collected Papers'' v. 8, paragraphs 385–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce said that to ''abduce'' a hypothetical explanation &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from an observed surprising circumstance &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is to surmise that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may be true because then &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; would be a matter of course.&lt;ref name=HL&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1903), Harvard lectures on pragmatism, ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, [http://www.textlog.de/7664-2.html paragraphs 188–189].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, to abduce &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; involves determining that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is [[necessary and sufficient conditions|sufficient (or nearly sufficient), but not necessary]], for &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

While inductive and abductive inference are not part of logic proper, the methodology of logic has been applied to them with some degree of success.  For example, the notion of deductive validity (where an inference is deductively valid [[if and only if]] there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false) exists in an analogy to the notion of inductive validity, or "strength", where an inference is inductively strong if and only if its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion.  Whereas the notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of [[semantics]], inductive validity requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations. The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association [[rule induction]], while others may use [[mathematical model]]s of probability such as [[decision tree]]s.

===Rival conceptions===
{{Main article|Rival conceptions of logic}}
Logic arose (see below) from a concern with correctness of [[argumentation]]. Modern logicians usually wish to ensure that logic studies just those arguments that arise from appropriately general forms of inference. For example, Thomas Hofweber writes in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' that logic "does not, however, cover good reasoning as a whole. That is the job of the theory of [[rationality]]. Rather it deals with inferences whose validity can be traced back to the formal features of the representations that are involved in that inference, be they linguistic, mental, or other representations."&lt;ref name="stanford-logic-onthology"/&gt;

Logic has been defined{{by whom|date=September 2016}} as "the study of arguments correct in virtue of their form".  This has not been the definition taken in this article, but the idea that logic treats special forms of argument, deductive argument, rather than argument in general, has a history in logic that dates back at least to [[logicism]] in mathematics (19th and 20th centuries) and the advent of the influence of mathematical logic on philosophy.  A consequence of taking logic to treat special kinds of argument is that it leads to identification of special kinds of truth, the logical truths (with logic equivalently being the study of logical truth), and excludes many of the original objects of study of logic that are treated as informal logic.  [[Robert Brandom]] has argued against the idea that logic is the study of a special kind of logical truth, arguing that instead one can talk of the logic of [[material inference]] (in the terminology of [[Wilfred Sellars]]), with logic making explicit the commitments that were originally implicit in informal inference.&lt;ref name="brandom-2000" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}}

==History==
{{Main article|History of logic}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Aristotle]], 384–322&amp;nbsp;BCE.]]
In Europe, logic was first developed by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="achievement"/&gt; [[Aristotelian logic]] became widely accepted in science and mathematics and remained in wide use in the West until the early 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="mtu"/&gt; Aristotle's system of logic was responsible for the introduction of [[hypothetical syllogism]],&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; [[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[modal logic]],&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]],&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; as well as influential terms such as [[terminology|terms]], [[predicables]], [[syllogisms]] and [[proposition]]s. In [[Europe]] during the later medieval period, major efforts were made to show that Aristotle's ideas were compatible with [[Christian]] faith. During the [[High Middle Ages]], logic became a main focus of philosophers, who would engage in critical logical analyses of philosophical arguments, often using variations of the methodology of [[scholasticism]]. In 1323, [[William of Ockham]]'s influential ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]]'' was released. By the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in [[Ludvig Holberg|Holberg]]'s satirical play ''[[Erasmus Montanus]]''.

The [[Logic in China|Chinese logical]] philosopher [[Gongsun Long]] ({{nowrap|c. 325–250 BCE}}) proposed the paradox "One and one cannot become two, since neither becomes two."&lt;ref name="propositions"/&gt; In China, the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic, however, was repressed by the [[Qin dynasty]] following the legalist philosophy of [[Han Feizi]].

In India, the [[Anviksiki]] school of logic was founded by [[Indian logic|Medhatithi Gautama]] (c. 6th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;S. C. Vidyabhusana (1971). ''A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools'', pp. 17–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations in the scholastic school, called [[Nyaya]], continued from ancient times into the early 18th&amp;nbsp;century with the [[Navya-Nyaya]] school. By the 16th&amp;nbsp;century, it developed theories resembling modern logic, such as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s "distinction between sense and reference of proper names" and his "definition of number", as well as the theory of "restrictive conditions for universals" anticipating some of the developments in modern [[set theory]].&lt;ref name="Chakrabarti"/&gt; Since 1824, Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and has had an influence on important 19th-century logicians such as [[Charles Babbage]], [[Augustus De Morgan]], and [[George Boole]].&lt;ref name="Indian logic: a reader"/&gt; In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, Western philosophers like Stanislaw Schayer and Klaus Glashoff have explored Indian logic more extensively.

The [[Syllogism|syllogistic]] logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-19th&amp;nbsp;century, when interest in the [[foundations of mathematics]] stimulated the development of symbolic logic (now called [[mathematical logic]]). In 1854, George Boole published ''[[The Laws of Thought|An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities]]'', introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as [[Boolean logic]]. In 1879, Gottlob Frege published ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]] notation. From 1910 to 1913, [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] published ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt; on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in symbolic logic. In 1931, [[Gödel]] raised serious problems with the foundationalist program and logic ceased to focus on such issues.

The development of logic since Frege, Russell, and [[Wittgenstein]] had a profound influence on the practice of philosophy and the perceived nature of philosophical problems (see [[analytic philosophy]]) and [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Logic, especially sentential logic, is implemented in computer [[Digital electronics|logic circuits]] and is fundamental to [[computer science]]. Logic is commonly taught by university philosophy departments, often as a compulsory discipline.

=={{vanchor|Types}}==
===Syllogistic logic===
{{main article|Aristotelian logic}}
[[File:Johannesmagistris-square.jpg|thumb|A depiction from the 15th century of the [[square of opposition]], which expresses the fundamental dualities of syllogistic.]]

The ''[[Organon]]'' was [[Aristotle]]'s body of work on logic, with the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' constituting the first explicit work in formal logic, introducing the syllogistic.&lt;ref name="Aristotle"/&gt; The parts of syllogistic logic, also known by the name [[term logic]], are the analysis of the judgements into propositions consisting of two terms that are related by one of a fixed number of relations, and the expression of inferences by means of [[syllogism]]s that consist of two propositions sharing a common term as premise, and a conclusion that is a proposition involving the two unrelated terms from the premises.

Aristotle's work was regarded in classical times and from medieval times in Europe and the Middle East as the very picture of a fully worked out system. However, it was not alone: the [[Stoics]] proposed a system of [[propositional logic]] that was studied by medieval logicians. Also, the [[problem of multiple generality]] was recognized in medieval times. Nonetheless, problems with syllogistic logic were not seen as being in need of revolutionary solutions.

Today, some academics claim that Aristotle's system is generally seen as having little more than historical value (though there is some current interest in extending term logics), regarded as made obsolete by the advent of propositional logic and the [[predicate calculus]]. Others use Aristotle in [[argumentation theory]] to help develop and critically question argumentation schemes that are used in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[legal]] arguments.

{{Quotation|I was upset. I had always believed logic was a universal weapon, and now I realized how its validity depended on the way it was employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Name of the Rose|last=Eco|first=Umberto|publisher=Vintage|year=1980|isbn=9780099466031|location=London|pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Propositional logic===
{{main article|Propositional calculus}}
A propositional calculus or logic (also a sentential calculus) is a formal system in which formulae representing propositions can be formed by combining [[atomic propositions]] using [[logical connectives]], and in which a system of formal proof rules establishes certain formulae as "theorems".  An example of a theorem of propositional logic is &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;, which says that if A holds, then B implies A.

===Predicate logic===
[[File:BS-12-Begriffsschrift Quantifier1-svg.svg|thumb|[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[Begriffschrift]]'' introduced the notion of quantifier in a graphical notation, which here represents the judgement that &lt;math&gt;\forall x. F(x)&lt;/math&gt; is true.]]
{{main article|Predicate logic}}
Predicate logic is the generic term for symbolic formal systems such as [[first-order logic]], [[second-order logic]], [[many-sorted logic]], and [[infinitary logic]].  It provides an account of [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]] general enough to express a wide set of arguments occurring in natural language.   For example, [[Bertrand Russell]]'s famous [[barber paradox]], "there is a man who shaves all and only men who do not shave themselves" can be formalised by the sentence &lt;math&gt;(\exists x ) (\text{man}(x) \wedge (\forall y) (\text{man}(y) \rightarrow (\text{shaves}(x, y)  \leftrightarrow \neg \text{shaves}(y, y))))&lt;/math&gt;, using the non-logical predicate &lt;math&gt;\text{man}(x)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that ''x'' is a man, and the non-logical relation &lt;math&gt;\text{shaves}(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that ''x'' shaves ''y''; all other symbols of the formulae are logical, expressing the universal and existential [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]], [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[Material conditional|implication]], [[negation]] and [[biconditional]].

Whilst Aristotelian syllogistic logic specifies a small number of forms that the relevant part of the involved judgements may take, predicate logic allows sentences to be analysed into subject and argument in several additional ways—allowing predicate logic to solve the [[problem of multiple generality]] that had perplexed medieval logicians.

The development of predicate logic is usually attributed to [[Gottlob Frege]], who is also credited as one of the founders of [[analytical philosophy]], but the formulation of predicate logic most often used today is the first-order logic presented in [[Principles of Mathematical Logic]] by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] in 1928. The analytical generality of predicate logic allowed the formalization of mathematics, drove the investigation of [[set theory]], and allowed the development of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s approach to [[model theory]]. It provides the foundation of modern [[mathematical logic]].

Frege's original system of predicate logic was second-order, rather than first-order. [[Second-order logic]] is most prominently defended (against the criticism of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and others) by [[George Boolos]] and [[Stewart Shapiro]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Modal logic===
{{main article|Modal logic}}
In languages, [[Linguistic modality|modality]] deals with the phenomenon that sub-parts of a sentence may have their semantics modified by special verbs or modal particles. For example, "''We go to the games''" can be modified to give "''We should go to the games''", and "''We can go to the games''" and perhaps "''We will go to the games''". More abstractly, we might say that modality affects the circumstances in which we take an assertion to be satisfied. Confusing modality is known as the [[modal fallacy]].

[[Aristotle]]'s logic is in large parts concerned with the theory of non-modalized logic. Although, there are passages in his work, such as the famous [[problem of future contingents|sea-battle argument]] in ''[[De Interpretatione]]'' § 9, that are now seen as anticipations of modal logic and its connection with [[potentiality]] and time, the earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by [[Avicenna]], who ultimately developed a theory of "[[Temporal logic|temporally]] [[Modal logic|modalized]]" syllogistic.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 |title=History of logic: Arabic logic |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the study of necessity and possibility remained important to philosophers, little logical innovation happened until the landmark investigations of [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] in 1918, who formulated a family of rival axiomatizations of the alethic modalities. His work unleashed a torrent of new work on the topic, expanding the kinds of modality treated to include [[deontic logic]] and [[epistemic logic]].  The seminal work of [[Arthur Prior]] applied the same formal language to treat [[temporal logic]] and paved the way for the marriage of the two subjects. [[Saul Kripke]] discovered (contemporaneously with rivals) his theory of [[Kripke semantics|frame semantics]], which revolutionized the formal technology available to modal logicians and gave a new [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] way of looking at modality that has driven many applications in [[computational linguistics]] and [[computer science]], such as [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]].

===Informal reasoning and dialectic===
{{main article|Informal logic|Logic and dialectic}}
The motivation for the study of logic in ancient times was clear: it is so that one may learn to distinguish good arguments from bad arguments, and so become more effective in argument and oratory, and perhaps also to become a better person. Half of the works of Aristotle's [[Organon]] treat inference as it occurs in an informal setting, side by side with the development of the syllogistic, and in the Aristotelian school, these informal works on logic were seen as complementary to Aristotle's treatment of [[rhetoric]].

This ancient motivation is still alive, although it no longer takes centre stage in the picture of logic; typically [[dialectic]]al logic forms the heart of a course in [[critical thinking]], a compulsory course at many universities.  Dialectic has been linked to logic since ancient times, but it has not been until recent decades that European and American logicians have attempted to provide mathematical foundations for logic and dialectic by formalising dialectical logic. [[Dialectical logic]] is also the name given to the special treatment of dialectic in [[Hegel]]ian and [[Marx]]ist thought.  There have been pre-formal treatises on argument and dialectic, from authors such as [[Stephen Toulmin]] (''The Uses of Argument''), [[Nicholas Rescher]] (''Dialectics''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Dialectics: A Controversy-Oriented Approach to the Theory of Knowledge|url=http://ojs.uwindsor.ca/ojs/leddy/index.php/informal_logic/article/view/2809|date=1978|journal=Informal Logic|volume=1|issue=#3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Stephen|title=Nicholas Rescher: Philosophical Dialectics|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25075-philosophical-dialectics-an-essay-on-metaphilosophy/|date=2006|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|issue=2006.07.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jacquette, Dale|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|title=Reason, Method, and Value: A Reader on the Philosophy of Nicholas Rescher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T65moyMMioYC|date=2009|publisher=Ontos Verlag|isbn=3110329050}}&lt;/ref&gt; and van Eemeren and Grootendorst ([[Pragma-dialectics]]).  Theories of [[defeasible reasoning]] can provide a foundation for the formalisation of dialectical logic and dialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue.  Such games can provide a formal [[game semantics]] for many logics.

[[Argumentation theory]] is the study and research of informal logic, fallacies, and critical questions as they relate to every day and practical situations. Specific types of dialogue can be analyzed and questioned to reveal premises, conclusions, and fallacies. Argumentation theory is now applied in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[law]].

===Mathematical logic===
{{main article|Mathematical logic}}
Mathematical logic comprises two distinct areas of research: the first is the application of the techniques of formal logic to mathematics and mathematical reasoning, and the second, in the other direction, the application of mathematical techniques to the representation and analysis of formal logic.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Elementary Mathematical Logic"/&gt;

The earliest use of mathematics and [[geometry]] in relation to logic and philosophy goes back to the ancient Greeks such as [[Euclid]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle"/&gt; Many other ancient and medieval philosophers applied mathematical ideas and methods to their philosophical claims.&lt;ref name="Prior Analytics"/&gt;

One of the boldest attempts to apply logic to mathematics was the [[logicism]] pioneered by philosopher-logicians such as [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Mathematical theories were supposed to be logical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and the programme was to show this by means of a reduction of mathematics to logic.&lt;ref name="Principia"/&gt; The various attempts to carry this out met with failure, from the crippling of Frege's project in his ''Grundgesetze'' by [[Russell's paradox]], to the defeat of [[Hilbert's program]] by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]s.

Both the statement of Hilbert's program and its refutation by Gödel depended upon their work establishing the second area of mathematical logic, the application of mathematics to logic in the form of [[proof theory]].&lt;ref name="Introduction to Mathematical Logic5"/&gt; Despite the negative nature of the incompleteness theorems, [[Gödel's completeness theorem]], a result in [[model theory]] and another application of mathematics to logic, can be understood as showing how close logicism came to being true: every rigorously defined mathematical theory can be exactly captured by a first-order logical theory; Frege's [[proof calculus]] is enough to ''describe'' the whole of mathematics, though not ''equivalent'' to it.

If proof theory and model theory have been the foundation of mathematical logic, they have been but two of the four pillars of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Barwise (1982) divides the subject of mathematical logic into model theory, proof theory, set theory and recursion theory.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Set theory]] originated in the study of the infinite by [[Georg Cantor]], and it has been the source of many of the most challenging and important issues in mathematical logic, from [[Cantor's theorem]], through the status of the [[Axiom of Choice]] and the question of the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]], to the modern debate on [[large cardinal]] axioms.

[[Recursion theory]] captures the idea of computation in logical and [[arithmetic]] terms; its most classical achievements are the undecidability of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] by [[Alan Turing]], and his presentation of the [[Church–Turing thesis]].&lt;ref name="Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity"/&gt; Today recursion theory is mostly concerned with the more refined problem of [[complexity class]]es—when is a problem efficiently solvable?—and the classification of [[Turing degree|degrees of unsolvability]].&lt;ref name="Theory of computation: formal languages, automata, and complexity6"/&gt;

===Philosophical logic===
{{main article|Philosophical logic}}
[[Philosophical logic]] deals with formal descriptions of ordinary, non-specialist [[Natural language|("natural") language]], that is strictly only about the arguments within philosophy's other branches. Most philosophers assume that the bulk of everyday&lt;!--was: "normal" proper--&gt; reasoning can be captured in logic if a method or methods to translate ordinary language into that logic can be found. Philosophical logic is essentially a continuation of the traditional discipline called "logic" before the invention of mathematical logic. Philosophical logic has a much greater concern with the connection between natural language and logic. As a result, philosophical logicians have contributed a great deal to the development of non-standard logics (e.g. [[free logic]]s, [[tense logic]]s) as well as various extensions of [[classical logic]] (e.g. [[modal logic]]s) and non-standard semantics for such logics (e.g. [[Saul Kripke|Kripke]]'s [[supervaluationism]] in the semantics of logic).

Logic and the philosophy of language are closely related. Philosophy of language has to do with the study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Epistemology and Cognition|first=Alvin I.|last=Goldman|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=9780674258969|page=293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XwhBw2jMqMC&amp;pg=PA293|quote=untrained subjects are prone to commit various sorts of fallacies and mistakes}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Intelligence, Mind, and Reasoning: Structure and Development|volume=106|series=Advances in Psychology|editor1-first=A.|editor1-last=Demetriou|editor2-first=A.|editor2-last=Efklides|publisher=Elsevier|year=1994|isbn=9780080867601|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkukZOU2pzIC&amp;pg=PA194}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational logic===
{{main article|Computational logic|Logic in computer science}}
[[File:Register transfer level - example toggler.svg|right|thumb|300px
|A simple toggling circuit is expressed using a logic gate and a synchronous register.]]
Logic cut to the heart of computer science as it emerged as a discipline: [[Alan Turing]]'s work on the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' followed from [[Kurt Gödel]]'s work on the [[incompleteness theorems]]. The notion of the general purpose computer that came from this work was of fundamental importance to the designers of the computer machinery in the 1940s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers predicted that when human knowledge could be expressed using logic with [[mathematical notation]], it would be possible to create a machine that reasons, or artificial intelligence. This was more difficult than expected because of the complexity of human reasoning. In [[logic programming]], a program consists of a set of axioms and rules. Logic programming systems such as [[Prolog]] compute the consequences of the axioms and rules in order to answer a query.

Today, logic is extensively applied in the fields of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer science]], and these fields provide a rich source of problems in formal and informal logic. [[Argumentation theory]] is one good example of how logic is being applied to artificial intelligence. The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] in particular regards:
* Section F.3 on [[Logics and meanings of programs]] and F.4 on [[Mathematical logic and formal languages]] as part of the theory of computer science: this work covers [[formal semantics of programming languages]], as well as work of [[formal methods]] such as [[Hoare logic]];
* [[Boolean logic]] as fundamental to computer hardware: particularly, the system's section B.2 on [[Arithmetic and logic structures]], relating to operatives [[logical conjunction|AND]], [[negation|NOT]], and [[logical disjunction|OR]];
* Many fundamental logical formalisms are essential to section I.2 on artificial intelligence, for example [[modal logic]] and [[default logic]] in [[Knowledge representation formalisms and methods]], [[Horn clause]]s in logic programming, and [[description logic]].

Furthermore, computers can be used as tools for logicians. For example, in symbolic logic and mathematical logic, proofs by humans can be computer-assisted. Using [[automated theorem proving]], the machines can find and check proofs, as well as work with proofs too lengthy to write out by hand.

===Non-classical logic===
{{Main article|Non-classical logic}}
The logics discussed above are all "[[Principle of bivalence|bivalent]]" or "two-valued"; that is, they are most naturally understood as dividing propositions into true and false propositions. [[Non-classical logic]]s are those systems that reject various rules of [[Classical logic]].

Hegel developed his own [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectic logic]] that extended [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s transcendental logic but also brought it back to ground by assuring us that "neither in heaven nor in earth, neither in the world of mind nor of nature, is there anywhere such an abstract 'either–or' as the understanding maintains. Whatever exists is concrete, with difference and opposition in itself".&lt;ref name="philosophical"/&gt;

In 1910, [[Nicolai A. Vasiliev]] extended the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction and proposed the law of excluded fourth and logic tolerant to contradiction.&lt;ref name="Brenner2008"/&gt; In the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] investigated the extension of the traditional true/false values to include a third value, "possible", so inventing [[ternary logic]], the first [[multi-valued logic]] in the Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Logic For Dummies|first=Mark|last=Zegarelli|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=9781118053072|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xm0-0Rs2GVoC&amp;pg=PA30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logics such as [[fuzzy logic]] have since been devised with an infinite number of "degrees of truth", represented by a [[real number]] between 0 and 1.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

[[Intuitionistic logic]] was proposed by [[L.E.J. Brouwer]] as the correct logic for reasoning about mathematics, based upon his rejection of the [[law of the excluded middle]] as part of his [[intuitionism]]. Brouwer rejected formalization in mathematics, but his student [[Arend Heyting]] studied intuitionistic logic formally, as did [[Gerhard Gentzen]]. Intuitionistic logic is of great interest to computer scientists, as it is a [[constructive logic]] and sees many applications, such as extracting verified programs from proofs and influencing the design of [[programming language]]s through the [[formulae-as-types correspondence]].

[[Modal logic]] is not truth conditional, and so it has often been proposed as a non-classical logic. However, modal logic is normally formalized with the principle of the excluded middle, and its [[relational semantics]] is bivalent, so this inclusion is disputable.

==Controversies==
==="Is Logic Empirical?"===
{{details|Is Logic Empirical?}}
What is the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] status of the [[Classical logic|laws of logic]]? What sort of argument is appropriate for criticizing purported principles of logic? In an influential paper entitled "[[Is Logic Empirical?]]"&lt;ref name="Is Logic Empirical?"/&gt; [[Hilary Putnam]], building on a suggestion of [[W. V. Quine]], argued that in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe, for example as the laws of [[mechanics]] or of [[general relativity]], and in particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic: if we want to be [[philosophical realism|realists]] about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory, then we should abandon the [[principle of distributivity]], substituting for classical logic the [[quantum logic]] proposed by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]].&lt;ref name="The Logic of Quantum Mechanics"/&gt;

Another paper of the same name by [[Michael Dummett]] argues that Putnam's desire for realism mandates the law of distributivity.&lt;ref name="Truth and Other Enigmas"/&gt; Distributivity of logic is essential for the realist's understanding of how propositions are true of the world in just the same way as he has argued the principle of bivalence is. In this way, the question, "Is Logic Empirical?" can be seen to lead naturally into the fundamental controversy in [[metaphysics]] on [[realism versus anti-realism]].

===Implication: Strict or material===
{{main article|Paradoxes of material implication}}
The notion of implication formalized in classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language by means of "if&amp;nbsp;... then&amp;nbsp;...", due to a number of problems called the [[paradoxes of material implication]].

The first class of paradoxes involves counterfactuals, such as ''If the moon is made of green cheese, then 2+2=5'', which are puzzling because natural language does not support the [[principle of explosion]]. Eliminating this class of paradoxes was the reason for [[C. I. Lewis]]'s formulation of [[strict implication]], which eventually led to more radically revisionist logics such as [[relevance logic]].

The second class of paradoxes involves redundant premises, falsely suggesting that we know the succedent because of the antecedent: thus "if that man gets elected, granny will die" is materially true since granny is mortal, regardless of the man's election prospects. Such sentences violate the [[Gricean maxim]] of relevance, and can be modelled by logics that reject the principle of [[monotonicity of entailment]], such as relevance logic.

===Tolerating the impossible===
{{main article|Paraconsistent logic}}
[[Hegel]] was deeply critical of any simplified notion of the [[law of non-contradiction]]. It was based on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s idea that this law of logic also requires a sufficient ground to specify from what point of view (or time) one says that something cannot contradict itself. A building, for example, both moves and does not move; the ground for the first is our solar system and for the second the earth. In Hegelian dialectic, the law of non-contradiction, of identity, itself relies upon difference and so is not independently assertable.

Closely related to questions arising from the paradoxes of implication comes the suggestion that logic ought to tolerate [[inconsistency]]. [[Relevance logic]] and [[paraconsistent logic]] are the most important approaches here, though the concerns are different: a key consequence of [[classical logic]] and some of its rivals, such as [[intuitionistic logic]], is that they respect the [[principle of explosion]], which means that the logic collapses if it is capable of deriving a contradiction. [[Graham Priest]], the main proponent of [[dialetheism]], has argued for paraconsistency on the grounds that there are in fact, true contradictions.&lt;ref name="stanford7"/&gt;{{clarify|this is a provocative statement that deserves an inline example or Wikipedia explanation of some sort|date=October 2016}}

===Rejection of logical truth===
The philosophical vein of various kinds of skepticism contains many kinds of doubt and rejection of the various bases on which logic rests, such as the idea of logical form, correct inference, or meaning, typically leading to the conclusion that there are no [[logical truth]]s. This is in contrast with the usual views in [[philosophical skepticism]], where logic directs skeptical enquiry to doubt received wisdoms, as in the work of [[Sextus Empiricus]].

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] provides a strong example of the rejection of the usual basis of logic: his radical rejection of idealization led him to reject truth as a "...&amp;nbsp;mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms—in short&amp;nbsp;... metaphors which are worn out and without sensuous power; coins which have lost their pictures and now matter only as metal, no longer as coins."&lt;ref name="nietzsche"/&gt; His rejection of truth did not lead him to reject the idea of either inference or logic completely, but rather suggested that "logic [came] into existence in man's head [out] of illogic, whose realm originally must have been immense. Innumerable beings who made inferences in a way different from ours perished".&lt;ref name="nietzsche8"/&gt; Thus there is the idea that logical inference has a use as a tool for human survival, but that its existence does not support the existence of truth, nor does it have a reality beyond the instrumental: "Logic, too, also rests on assumptions that do not correspond to anything in the real world".&lt;ref name="nietzsche9"/&gt;

This position held by Nietzsche however, has come under extreme scrutiny for several reasons. Some philosophers, such as [[Jürgen Habermas]], claim his position is self-refuting—and accuse Nietzsche of not even having a coherent perspective, let alone a theory of knowledge.&lt;ref name="nietzsche10"/&gt; [[Georg Lukács]], in his book ''The Destruction of Reason'', asserts that, "Were we to study Nietzsche's statements in this area from a logico-philosophical angle, we would be confronted by a dizzy chaos of the most lurid assertions, arbitrary and violently incompatible."&lt;ref name="marxists"/&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] described Nietzsche's irrational claims with "He is fond of expressing himself paradoxically and with a view to shocking conventional readers" in his book ''A History of Western Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=A History of Western Philosophy And Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day|year=1945|publisher=Simon and Schuster|url=http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf/|page=762|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528221822/http://www.ntslibrary.com/PDF%20Books/History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laurentius Scupulus.jpg|thumb|200px|Lorenzo Scupoli ''Laurentius Scupulus'']]
'''Lorenzo''' ('''Lawrence''') '''Scupoli''' (ca. 1530 &amp;ndash; 28 November 1610) was the author of ''Il combattimento spirituale'' (''The Spiritual Combat''), one of the most important [[Literature|work]]s of [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[spirituality]].

==Life==
Scupoli was from [[Otranto]] in [[Apulia]]. At baptism, he received the name Francesco (Francis). Being already in a mature age in 1569, he joined the [[Theatines]]. He took [[Holy Orders]] exceptionally fast, after eight years.

In 1585 he was accused of breaking the rule. He was arrested for a year and deprived of the [[priesthood|priestly]] faculties. Finally he was [[wikt:exculpation|exculpated]] from blame, but he had to wait for it almost till his death. He used to endure the injust accusations and punishments with [[humility]], sacrificing the suffering for various intentions.

==''The Spiritual Combat''==
[[File:Il combattimento spirituale.png|thumb|200px|Il combattimento Spirituale ''The Spiritual Combat'']]
In 1589 in [[Venice]] the first edition of the work of his life was printed. At once it gained huge esteem and became a [[bestseller]]. During the first 20 years it was published 60 times and translated into German, [[Latin]], French, English and Spanish. Next there were made Portuguese, [[Croatian language|Croatian]], Polish, [[Armenian language|Armenian]], Greek (by [[Nicodemus the Hagiorite]]), [[Arabian language|Arabian]] and Japanese versions. In the 19th century, Russian monk [[Theophan the Recluse|Theophanes]] paraphrased it, writing ''The Invisible Fight'', a book which had big influence on the [[Orthodox Church]]. Until now there were as much as 600 editions of ''The Spiritual Combat''.

The ''Combat'' is a practical manual of living. At first it teaches that the sense of life is incessant fighting against [[egotism|egoistic]] longings and replacing them with sacrifice and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. The one who does not do this loses, and [[suffering|suffers]] in [[Hell]]; the one who does it, trusting not in his own, but [[God]]'s power, triumphs and is happy in Heaven. The work of Scupoli analyses various usual situations and advises how to cope with them, preserving a pure [[conscience]] and improving [[virtue]]. It emphasizes also the boundless goodness of God, which is the cause of all good. What is bad originates from the human who rebels against God.

==Biography==
Born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], Wilson earned a [[Bachelor's degree|BA]] from [[Vassar College]] in 1960 and received her Ph.D. in [[philosophy]] from [[Harvard University]] five years later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While at Harvard she was a student of [[Burton Dreben]].&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophy Family Tree: https://webspace.utexas.edu/deverj/personal/philtree/philtree.html&lt;nowiki/&gt;.site retired from service information verifiable via  https://web.archive.org/web/20120124195321/https://webspace.utexas.edu/deverj/personal/philtree/philtree.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at Harvard in 1960-61 and then studied at [[Oxford University]] in 1963-64. Wilson spent the early years of her career as an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Columbia University]] (1965-1967), and went on to teach at the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]] between 1967 and 1970.

In 1970, Wilson became the first female member of faculty in the philosophy department at Princeton&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; when she was appointed as an associate professor of philosophy.  Wilson was promoted to full professor in 1975, and in 1998 was finally named Stuart Professor of Philosophy.  During her tenure at Princeton she shared a department with other prominent philosophers including [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Harry Frankfurt]], [[Gilbert Harman|Gil Harman]], [[Bas van Fraassen]], [[Paul Benacerraf]] and [[Richard Jeffrey]] (she can be seen pictured with many of the same in a 1979 faculty photograph [https://philosophy.princeton.edu/about/seventies-snapshot here]).  Wilson taught courses in [[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] and other early modern philosophers as well as the [[Philosophy of Religion]].  In her scholarship, Wilson focused on the history of early modern philosophy, the philosophy of religion, the [[philosophy of mind]], and the theory of perception.  Author of ''[http://philpapers.org/s/Margaret%20Dauler%20Wilson Descartes]'' (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1978), as well as of many articles on 17th and 18th-century metaphysics and epistemology, some of which are collected in her, ''[https://www.amazon.com/Ideas-Mechanism-Margaret-Dauler-Wilson/dp/0691004714 Ideas and Mechanism]'' (1999), Wilson was also editor of ''The Essential Descartes'' (1969) and co-editor (with D. Brock and R. Kuhns) of ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0136641105 Philosophy: An Introduction]'' (1972).

Margaret Wilson has been described as "the most eminent English-language historian of early modern philosophy of her generation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/8525737F00583BEB/file/C125737F0061E4BAC125756D005F8BC3/$FILE/leibniz_1999_0009_0000_0001_0015.pdf|title=Margaret Dauler Wilson: A Life in Philosophy|last=Wilson|first=Catherine|date=|website=Philosophy Documentation Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was awarded many honors over the course of her distinguished career, and was among only a handful of prominent female philosophers in a field overwhelmingly dominated by men.&lt;ref&gt;"How can we end the male domination of philosophy?" https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/nov/26/modern-philosophy-sexism-needs-more-women&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;What Is Philosophy's Problem With Women?: http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/09/09/philosophy_has_a_woman_problem_let_s_try_to_figure_out_why.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In the Humanities, Men Dominate the Fields of Philosophy and History": http://chronicle.com/article/Men-Dominate-Philosophy-and/135306/&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson won a [[Guggenheim fellowship]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gf.org/fellows/all-fellows/margaret-dauler-wilson/|title=MARGARET DAULER WILSON|last=|first=|date=|website=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[American Council of Learned Societies]] fellowship in 1982.  She was also a Centennial Medalist of the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1989, and was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1992. In 1994, Wilson received Princeton University's Howard T. Behrman Award for distinguished achievement in the humanities.

Active in professional organizations, Wilson served as vice-president of the Eastern Division of the [[American Philosophical Association]] (APA) for 1993-94 and for 1994-95. She also served on a number of APA committees, including the Subcommittee on the Status of Women in the Profession.  President of the [[Leibniz Society of North America]] from 1985–90, she was a member of numerous other associations, such as the Hobbes Society, the Hume Society, the North American Spinoza Society and the British Society for the History of Philosophy. Wilson served as a juror for the Arts and Humanities for the 1997 [[Heinz Foundation]] awards. Wilson died at the age of 59 on August 27, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/98/x0913/0913-obit.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, the Margaret Dauler Wilson Biennial Philosophy Conference has been held in her honor &lt;ref&gt;Margaret Wilson Conferences: http://sites.google.com/site/margaretwilsonconferences/&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016, the Department of Philosophy at Princeton University began an occasional series of lectures in her name.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The inaugural lecture was given by [[Christia Mercer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philosophy.princeton.edu/content/christia-mercer-will-give-departments-inaugural-margaret-dauler-wilson-occasional-lecture|title=Christia Mercer will give the Department's Inaugural Margaret Dauler Wilson Occasional Lecture. {{!}} Department of Philosophy|website=philosophy.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of several of Wilson's former students who themselves went on to become prominent philosophers, others include [[Janet Broughton]], Lisa J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20790">[[File:Max bense.jpg|thumb|Max Bense (1969)]]
'''Max Bense''' (February 7, 1910 in [[Strasbourg]] – April 29, 1990 in [[Stuttgart]]) was a [[Germany|German]] philosopher, writer, and publicist, known for his work in [[philosophy of science]], [[logic]], [[aesthetics]], and [[semiotics]]. His thoughts combine [[natural sciences]], [[art]], and [[philosophy]] under a collective perspective and follow a definition of reality, which – under the term ''existential rationalism'' – is able to remove the separation between humanities and natural sciences.

==Life==
Max Bense spent his early childhood in his birthplace Strasbourg and in 1918 his family was deported from [[Alsace-Lorraine]] as a consequence of [[World War I]]. Starting in 1920, he attended grammar school in [[Cologne]] and after 1930 he studied physics, chemistry, mathematics, geology, and philosophy at the [[University of Bonn]]. During his studies, his interest in literature is revealed by several contributions to newspapers, journals, and broadcast, for which he wrote several [[radio drama]]s. In 1937 he received his doctor's degree (Dr. phil. nat.) with his dissertation "Quantenmechanik und Daseinsrelativität" ([[Quantum Mechanics]] and Relativity of ''[[Dasein]]''). He used the term ''Relativity of Dasein'', which he adopted from [[Max Scheler]], for explaining that novel theories do not have to contradict classical science. Bense – declared opponent of [[national socialism]] – knowingly opposed the [[Deutsche Physik]] of the Nazi regime (cf. [[Johannes Juilfs]]), which rejected the [[theory of relativity]] due to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[Jew]]ish origin. Therefore, he did not receive his postdoctoral qualification.

In 1938, Bense initially worked as a physicist at the [[Bayer AG]] in [[Leverkusen]]. After the outbreak of [[World War II]] he was a soldier, firstly as a meteorologist, then as a medical technician in [[Berlin]] and [[Georgenthal]], where he was mayor for a short time after the end of the war. In 1945 the [[University of Jena]] appointed him to [[curator]] (Chancellor of the University) and offered him the possibility of postdoctoral work ([[habilitation]]), which was likely to be cumulative, at the Social-Pedagogic Faculty, which was followed by an appointment to [[Professor#Main positions 2|Professor extraordinarius]] of philosophical and scientific [[propaedeutics]].

In 1948, Bense fled from the political development of the [[Soviet occupation zone]] to [[Boppard]]; and he was appointed as a guest professor in philosophy and theory of science by the [[University of Stuttgart]] in 1949, and as senior lecturer (associate professor) there in 1950. In 1955, Bense raised a controversy concerning [[Mythology|mythologizing]] tendencies of German postwar culture. Thereupon he became the target of public [[polemics]], resulting in a postponement of his appointment to [[professor#Main positions 2|full professor]] until 1963.

In addition, he worked at the adult education center in [[Ulm]] and at the [[Ulm School of Design]] from 1953 to 1958; he was also guest professor at the [[Hamburg College for Visual Arts]] from 1958 to 1960 and in 1966/67.

Max Bense became professor [[emeritus]] on February 7, 1978 and died in 1990 as an internationally accredited scientist.

==Philosophy==
[[File:Max Bense Raum und Ich 1934.JPG|thumb|"Raum und Ich" ("Space and Ego"), Bense's first publication (Berlin 1934)]]

===Mathematics in art and language===
Already in his first publication, "Raum und Ich" ("Space and Ego"; 1934), Bense combined theoretical philosophy with mathematics, semiotics, and aesthetics; this remained his thematic emphasis. For the first time, he phrased a rational aesthetics, which defines the components of language – words, syllables, [[phoneme]]s – as a statistical language repertoire, and which opposes literature that is based upon meaning. Conversely, Bense studied the concept of style, which he applied to mathematics – following [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]' ''Mathesis Universalis'' –, designing a universal [[markup language]]. "Die Mathematik in der Kunst" ("Mathematics in Art"; 1949) was his starting point for investigating mathematical principles of form in the history of art. From this, Bense developed a perspective to see the mathematical spirit in works of literary art, especially in [[Meter (poetry)|metrics]] and [[rhythm]]. Bense's thoughts assumed the correlation of a mathematical and linguistic consciousness, which have a common origin and have grown into complementary modes of thought. He considered the [[atomism|atomistic structures]] of the linguistic modes to be equivalent. By using non-interpretable basic elements (characters) and rules or operators, these forms give meaning, impart information and make stylistically formed language possible. He considered the aesthetic and the semantic information to be generally separated and not to be defined until they are used. This was the first German integration of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s work into the field of aesthetics.

Some of Bense's knowledge is based on the investigations of the American mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]]. Thus some termini like "redundancy" and "entropy" have to be equated with "Ordnungsmaß" and "Materialverbrauch" (consumption of material) from Birkhoff's aesthetics research.

===Technology and ethics===
Bense considered the destruction of the social and intellectual middle-class world since the beginning of the 20th century a parallel to the destruction of the concept of [[being]] in philosophy. He saw the natural world replaced by an artificial one. As a forerunner of the computer age, Bense thought about the technical counterparts of human existence; unlike many of his contemporaries he considered machines as pure products of human intelligence, having [[algorithm]]s as a basis, but soon he posed ethical questions, which were not discussed in [[Technology assessment|ethics of technology]] until decades later. His pragmatic views of technology, influenced by [[Walter Benjamin]], which lacked either belief in progress or its rejection, brought him the criticism of [[Theodor W. Adorno]] – and again put him in the role of the opposition.

===Structural analysis of language===
Inspired by [[neuroscience]], [[Information technology|informatics]], and the occupation with electronic calculating machines, but also by Wittgenstein's concept of the [[language-game]], Bense tried to put into perspective or to extend the traditional view of literature. In that, he was one of the first philosophers of culture who integrated the technical possibilities of the [[computer]] into their thoughts and investigated them across disciplinary boundaries. He statistically and [[topology|topologically]] analysed linguistic phenomena, subjected them to questions of [[semiotic]], [[information theory]], and [[communication theory]] using [[structuralism|structuralistic]] approaches. Thus Bense became the first theoretician of [[concrete poetry]], which was started by [[Eugen Gomringer]] in 1953, and encouraged e.g. [[Helmut Heißenbüttel]], [[Claus Bremer]], [[Reinhard Döhl]], [[Ludwig Haring]], and [[Franz Mon]] to perform further experiments, and also had influence on [[Ernst Jandl]]'s language deconstruction (see also [[Stuttgarter Gruppe/Schule]]).

===Discussion with writers===
In his work with literature and literary language, Bense was not content with only theoretical considerations; he had close contact to authors like [[Alfred Andersch]] and [[Arno Schmidt]]. His constructions of analogy to [[visual arts]] made major contributions to the understanding of [[cubism]] and [[dadaism]].

===Understanding of science===
As a theoretician of science, Bense represented the ''synthetic intellectual concept,'' where classical [[humanism]] and modern technology constructively complement one another. From this concept of science, he hoped for progressive knowledge, which must always be ethically scrutinized, and at the same time, for the prevention of regression. Because of that, Bense argued for [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and put himself into that tradition.

After 1984 Max Bense applied his theories of visual art to screen media. Because of that, early thoughts of [[media studies]] concerning the [[internet]], especially the concept of [[digital poetry]], may be traced back to Bense.

'''''Modern Meat: Antibiotics, Hormones, and the Pharmaceutical Farm''''' is a 1984 book by [[Orville Schell]] on [[intensive animal farming]] and [[antibiotic use in livestock]].

==Reviews==

One reviewer said that the book is a "startling introduction to today's mass-producing factory farms" but that it had the flaw of the author's "unrestrained personal bias and overdramatization of issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/1022/102209.html |title='Modern Meat' raises tough questions for consumers to chew on; Modern Meat: Antibiotics, Hormones, and the Pharmaceutical Farm, by Orville Schell. |first=Cynthia B. |last=Marquand |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=22 October 1984 |accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reviewer said that the book was controversial and "warns of subtle—but potentially dangerous—long-range effects of 'pharmaceutical farming.'"&lt;ref name="People"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faber|first1=Nancy|title=Orville Schell Beefs About Cattle and Chemicals in a Controversial Book, Modern Meat|journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=September 24, 1984|volume=22|issue=13|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20088734,00.html|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer summarized the book's coverage as descriptions of "the indiscriminate use of ""subtherapeutic"" antibiotics in animal feeds (probably contributing to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in both human and animal hosts); the use of diethylstilbestrol and other hormones; and (more briefly) the USDA meat-inspection programs--plus the industry's search for what could be described as nonfood feeds to simplify the stoking of four-footed machines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/orville-schell-5/modern-meat-antibiotics-hormones-and-the-pharma/ |title=MODERN MEAT: Antibiotics, Hormones and the Pharmaceutical Farm by Orville Schell |author=staff |work=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=1 April 1984 |accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Cattlemen's Beef Association]] called the book "one-sided" and "seriously flawed".&lt;ref name="People"/&gt; Consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]] called the book "precise and gripping".&lt;ref name="People"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11698">'''Moral syncretism''' consists of the attempt to reconcile disparate or contradictory [[Morality|moral beliefs]], often while melding the [[ethics|ethical]] practices of various schools of thought.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==The role of moral syncretism==
The requirements of a global ethic call for "a minimal basic [[consensus]] relating to binding values, irrevocable standards and moral attitudes, which can be affirmed by all religions despite their undeniable dogmatic or theological differences and should also be supported by non-believers."&lt;ref name="Global Ethic and Human Responsibilities"&gt;{{cite web | title=Global Ethic and Human Responsibilities | author=[[Hans Küng]] | work=Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, Santa Clara University (2007) | url=http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/focusareas/global_ethics/laughlin-lectures/global-ethic-human-responsibility.html | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It cannot, however, make the specific ethics of the different [[religions]] and [[philosophies]] around the world superfluous or obsolete, nor should it strive to do so.&lt;ref name="Global Ethic and Human Responsibilities"/&gt;

[[Syncretism]] tends to facilitate coexistence and constructive interaction between different cultures ([[intercultural competence]]), a factor that has recommended it to rulers of multi-ethnic [[empire|realm]]s. Conversely the rejection of syncretism, usually in the name of "[[piety]]" and "orthodoxy," may help to generate, bolster or authorize a sense of [[Cultural identity|cultural unity]] in a well-defined minority or majority. While strengthening the ethical [[Cultural identity|identity]] of the [[subculture|subgroup]], this is often detrimental to the [[Cooperation|unity]] of the whole.

==Morality independent of religion==
A [[cornerstone]] of moral syncretism is that [[religion]] cannot be morality's only arbiter.

The [[Dalai Lama]], for example, has said that compassion and affection are human values that are independent of religion: "We need these human values. I call these [[secular ethics]], secular beliefs. There’s no relationship with any particular religion. Even without religion, even as nonbelievers, we have the capacity to promote these things."&lt;ref name="The Dalai Lama Interview"&gt;{{cite web | author=Amitabh Pal | title=The Dalai Lama Interview | work=The Progressive (January 2006) | url=http://www.progressive.org/mag_intv0106 | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion is also supported by the [[traditional]] [[Judeo-Christian]] concept of [[natural law]]. In his book ''On Law, Morality and Politics'', [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] identifies the innate rational nature of humans as being what defines moral law: "The rule and measure of human acts is the reason, which is the first principle of human acts."&lt;ref name="Natural Law"&gt;{{cite web | title=Natural Law | work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2006) | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n/natlaw.htm | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not, however, mean secular ethics and religion are mutually exclusive. In fact, many principles, such as the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|Golden Rule]], are present in both systems, and some religious people, as well as some [[Deists]], prefer to adopt a rational approach to ethics.

===Atheism and morality===
Most [[atheists]] argue that no religious basis is necessary for one to live an ethical life.&lt;ref name="Is Atheism Consistent With Morality?"&gt;{{cite web | title=Is Atheism Consistent With Morality? | author=Mark I. Vuletic | work=Modern Documents, The Secular Web Library (2001) | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mark_vuletic/moral.html | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that atheists are as motivated towards moral behavior as anyone, or more, citing a range of non-theistic sources of moral behavior including: parental love, their conventional (or advanced) [[education|educated upbringing]], natural [[empathy]], [[compassion]] and the [[humanism|humane concern]]; respect for [[norm (social)|social norms]], [[criminal law]] stemming from [[natural law]], [[Police|police or other enforced order]] (and in some cases [[social order|society]]); and a desire for a good reputation and self-esteem. According to this view, ethical behavior is a natural consequence of altruistic motivation, not stemming from divine or tenet-prescribed system of punishment or reward [[Karma|in life]] and/or after death, though experiences and tentative expectations may instead play a role in forming and strengthening a moral atheist's motivations and ethics, united in rejection of any theory of all human beings' [[afterlife]]. Thus while atheism does not entail any particular moral philosophy, many atheists are drawn towards philosophies and worldviews such as: [[secular humanism]], [[empiricism]], [[objectivist philosophy|objectivism]], or [[utilitarianism]], which provide a moral framework that is not founded on faith in deities.{{or|date=January 2013}}

===Humanist ethics===
[[Humanism|Humanists]] endorse [[Moral universalism|universal morality]] based on the commonality of [[human nature]] and the belief that knowledge of right and wrong is based on our understanding of individual and joint interests, rather than a system of ethics stemming from a transcendental or arbitrarily local source, rejecting [[faith]] completely as a basis for moral action. The humanist ethics goal is a search for viable individual, social and political principles of conduct, judging them on their ability to enhance human well-being and individual responsibility.

The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU) is the worldwide umbrella organization for those adhering to the Humanist life stance. Member organisations and individual members are required to accept the following statement:

:Humanism is a [[democracy|democratic]] and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality.

Humanism is also known to adopt principles of the [[Golden Rule (ethics)|Golden Rule]]. As [[Oscar Wilde]] once said, "Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live." This emphasizes a respect for other people's identities and ideals.

===School of Economic Science===
The [[School of Economic Science]] (SES) is an [[organisation]] based in [[Mandeville Place]], [[London]], founded by Leon MacLaren in 1937. Originally constituted to facilitate the study of [[economics]], over time it came to focus on [[philosophy]], particularly the [[Hindu]] tradition of [[Advaita Vedanta]].&lt;ref name="Welcome to the School of Economic Science"&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome to the School of Economic Science | work=School of Economic Science, www.schooleconomicscience.org | url=http://www.schooleconomicscience.org/ | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North America]], the SES is also known as the [[School of Practical Philosophy]], or by other similar names.

==Religions that incorporate moral syncretism==
Several groups have taken on the challenge of establishing a [[world community]] through  doctrine, faith and practice.

===Unitarian Universalism===
[[Unitarian Universalism]] is a [[liberal religion|theologically liberal]] [[List of religions#Unitarian Universalism|religion]] characterized by its support of "a free and responsible search for truth and meaning."&lt;ref name="A Free and Responsible Search for Truth and Meaning"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Free and Responsible Search for Truth and Meaning |work=A Sermon by the Rev. James R. Bridges |url=http://home.hvc.rr.com/uucrt/a_free_and_responsible_search_fo.htm |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212144944/http://home.hvc.rr.com/uucrt/a_free_and_responsible_search_fo.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This principle permits Unitarian Universalists a wide range of beliefs and practices. Some communities even offer a class called "Building Your Own Theology."

Many Unitarian Universalists consider themselves [[humanism|humanists]], while others hold [[Christian]], [[Buddhist]], [[Jew]]ish, [[pagan]], [[atheist]], [[agnostic]], [[pantheist]], or other beliefs.  Some choose to attach no particular theological label to their idiosyncratic combination of beliefs.  Others consider themselves to be Unitarian Universalists in theology and seek moral orientation in the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|Unitarian Universalist Association's]] [[Unitarian Universalism#Seven Principles and Purposes|Seven Principles]] and [[Unitarian Universalism#Six Sources|Six Sources]].  This diversity of views is considered a strength, since the emphasis is placed on a common search for a meaningful existence, rather than an adherence to a particular [[doctrine]].

===Universal Sufism===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Soefiembleem.gif|thumb|The symbol of Universal Sufism, "Tughra Inayati"]] --&gt;
The philosophy of [[Universal Sufism]] revolves around a [[Cooperation|unity]] of all people and [[religion]]s, as well as the ability to find [[beauty]] in all things. It is a form of [[Sufism]] that does not exist within the traditional framework of [[Islam]] and  was most likely influenced by [[Advaita]] philosophy. Universal Sufism is characterised by its respect (if not inclusion) for other devotional traditions and its disapproval of miracles.

It is mandated that Universal Sufis should strive to "realize and spread the knowledge of Unity, the religion of Love, and Wisdom, so that the biases and prejudices of faiths and beliefs may, of themselves, fall away, the human heart overflow with love, and all hatred caused by distinctions and differences be rooted out."&lt;ref name="The 3 Objects of the Sufi Movement"&gt;{{cite web | title=The 3 Objects of the Sufi Movement | work=Hazrat Pir-o-Murshid Inayat Khan, Sufi Ruhaniat International (1956-2006) | url=http://www.ruhaniat.org/readings/3Objects.php | accessdate=2007-06-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070307134652/http://www.ruhaniat.org/readings/3Objects.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darwin's Pangenesis.svg|thumb|upright=2|[[Charles Darwin]]'s pangenesis theory postulated that every part of the body emits tiny particles called gemmules which migrate to the [[gonad]]s and are transferred to offspring. Gemmules were thought to develop into their associated body parts as offspring matures. The theory implied that changes to the body during an organism's life would be inherited, as proposed in [[Lamarckism]].]]

'''Pangenesis''' was [[Charles Darwin]]'s hypothetical mechanism for [[heredity]], in which he proposed that each part of the body continually emitted its own type of small organic particles called '''gemmules''' that aggregated in the [[gonad]]s, contributing heritable information to the [[gamete]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holterhoff, Kate |date=2014 |title=The History and Reception of Charles Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=47 |pages=661–695 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9377-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented this 'provisional hypothesis' in his 1868 work ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', intending it to fill what he perceived as a major gap in evolutionary theory at the time. The etymology of the word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''pan'' (a prefix meaning "whole", "encompassing") and ''genesis'' ("birth") or ''genos'' ("origin"). Pangenesis mirrored ideas originally formulated by [[Hippocrates]] and other pre-Darwinian scientists, but built off of new concepts such as [[cell theory]], explaining cell development as beginning with gemmules which were specified to be necessary for the occurrence of new growths in an organism, both in initial development and regeneration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|last=de Beer|first=Gavin|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=1965|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also accounted for [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] and the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] concept of the inheritance of acquired characteristics, as a body part altered by the environment would produce altered gemmules. This made Pangenesis popular among the neo-Lamarckian school of evolutionary thought.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This hypothesis was made effectively obsolete after the 1900 rediscovery among [[biologist]]s of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of the [[Mendelian inheritance|particulate nature of inheritance]].

==Early history==

Pangenesis was similar to ideas put forth by [[Hippocrates]], [[Democritus]] and other pre-Darwinian scientists in proposing that the whole of parental organisms participate in heredity (thus the prefix ''pan'').&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zirkle | first1 = Conway | authorlink = Conway Zirkle | year = 1935 | title = The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis | url = | journal = [[The American Naturalist]] | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin wrote that Hippocrates' pangenesis was "almost identical with mine—merely a change of terms—and an application of them to classes of facts necessarily unknown to the old philosopher."&lt;ref name="Deichmann 2010"&gt;Deichmann, Ute. (2010). ''Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology''. Springer. pp. 41-42. {{ISBN|978-90-481-9901-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science historian [[Conway Zirkle]] wrote that:

{{quote|The hypothesis of pangenesis is as old as the belief in the inheritance of acquired characters. It was endorsed by [[Hippocrates]], [[Democritus]], [[Galen]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Lactantius]], [[St. Isidore of Seville]], [[Bartholomeus Anglicus]], [[St. Albert the Great]], [[St. Thomas of Aquinas]], [[Pietro de' Crescenzi|Peter of Crescentius]], [[Paracelsus]], [[Jerome Cardan]], [[Levinus Lemnius]], [[Nicolas Venette|Venette]], [[John Ray]], [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], [[Charles Bonnet|Bonnet]], [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertius]], [[Albrecht von Haller|von Haller]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Zirkle demonstrated that the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics had become fully accepted by the 16th century and remained immensely popular through to the time of Lamarck's work, at which point it began to draw more criticism due to lack of hard evidence.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; He also stated that pangenesis was the only scientific explanation ever offered for this concept, developing from Hippocrates' belief that "the semen was derived from the whole body."&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; In the 13th century, pangenesis was commonly accepted on the principle that semen was a refined version of food unused by the body, which eventually translated to 15th and 16th century widespread use of pangenetic principles in medical literature, especially in gynecology.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; Later pre-Darwinian important applications of the idea included hypotheses about the origin of the differentiation of races.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt;

A theory put forth by [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] in 1745 called for particles from both parents governing the attributes of the child, although some historians have called his remarks on the subject cursory and vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |date=1981 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674364462 |pages=328, 646}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|last=de Beer|first=Gavin|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|year=1965|isbn=|location=Garden City, New York|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] developed a hypothetical system of heredity much like Darwin's pangenesis, wherein 'organic molecules' were transferred to offspring during reproduction and stored in the body during development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hull, David L. (1988). ''Science as a Process: An Evolutionary Account of the Social and Conceptual Development of Science''. University of Chicago Press. p. 86. {{ISBN|0-226-36051-2}} "As Darwin was to discover many years later, Buffon had devised a system of heredity not all that different from his own theory of pangenesis."&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on Buffon's views, Darwin stated, "If Buffon had assumed that his organic molecules had been formed by each separate unit throughout the body, his view and mine would have been very closely similar."&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935"/&gt;

In 1801, [[Erasmus Darwin]] advocated a hypothesis of pangenesis in the third edition of his book ''[[Zoonomia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Deichmann, Ute. (2010). ''Darwinism, Philosophy, and Experimental Biology''. Springer. p. 42. {{ISBN|978-90-481-9901-3}} "Among the other authors were Buffon, who proposes "organic molecules" with affinities to various organs, and, in particular, Erasmus Darwin, who in 1801 anticipated his grandson's concept of pangenesis, suggesting that small particles were given off by parts of the bodies of both parents; and that they are circulated in the blood, ending in the sexual organs from where they could be combined during reproduction in order to form the nucleus of an offspring."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1809, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] in his ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'' put forth evidence for the idea that characteristics acquired during the lifetime of an organism, either from effects of the environment or  may be passed on to the offspring.  Charles Darwin first had significant contact with [[Lamarckism]] during his time at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] in the late 1820s, both through [[Robert Edmond Grant]], whom he assisted in research, and in Erasmus's journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=E.

In 1861, Irish physician [[Henry Freke]] developed a variant of pangenesis in his book ''Origin of Species by Means of Organic Affinity''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Macalister|Macalister, Alexander]]. (1870). ''Reviews and Bibliographical Notices''. In ''[[Irish Journal of Medical Science|Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science]], Volume 50''. Fannin and Company. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Freke proposed that all life was developed from microscopic organic agents which he named ''granules'', which existed as 'distinct species of organizing matter' and would develop into different biological structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a944AAAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-a944AAAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1|title=On the origin of species by means of organic affinity|last=Freke|first=Henry|date=1861|publisher=Longman and Co.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, four years before the publication of ''Variation'', [[Herbert Spencer]] in his book ''Principles of Biology'' proposed a theory of "physiological units" similar to Darwin's gemmules, which likewise were said to be related to specific body parts and responsible for the transmission of characteristics of those body parts to offspring.&lt;ref name="Deichmann 2010"/&gt; He also supported the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] idea of transmission of acquired characteristics.

Darwin had debated whether to publish a theory of heredity for an extended period of time due to its highly speculative nature. He decided to include pangenesis in ''Variation'' after sending a 30 page manuscript to his close friend and supporter [[Thomas Huxley]] in May 1865, which was met by significant criticism from Huxley that made Darwin even more hesitant.&lt;ref name="Geison69" /&gt; However, Huxley eventually advised Darwin to publish, writing: "Somebody rummaging among your papers half a century hence will find Pangenesis &amp; say 'See this wonderful anticipation of our modern Theories—and that stupid ass, Huxley, prevented his publishing them'"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4875.html | title = Letter 4875 – Huxley, T. H. to Darwin, C. R., 16 July (1865) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's initial version of pangenesis appeared in the first edition of ''Variation'' in 1868, and was later reworked for the publication of a second edition in 1875.

==Theory==

=== Darwin ===
Darwin's pangenesis theory attempted to explain the process of [[sexual reproduction]], inheritance of traits, and complex [[developmental biology|developmental]] phenomena such as cellular [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] in a unified mechanistic structure.&lt;ref name="Geison69"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Geison | first1=G.

When passed on to offspring via the reproductive process, gemmules were thought to be responsible for developing into each part of an organism and expressing characteristics inherited from both parents.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Darwin thought this to occur in a literal sense: he explained cell proliferation to progress as gemmules to bind to more developed cells of their same character and mature. In this sense, the uniqueness of each individual would be due to their unique mixture of their parents’ gemmules, and therefore characters.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Similarity to one parent over the other could be explained by a quantitative superiority of one parent's gemmules.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|date=May 2008|title=A new perspective on Darwin’s Pangenesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00036.x|journal=Biological Reviews|language=en|volume=83|issue=2|pages=141–149|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x|issn=1464-7931|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yongshen Lu points out that Darwin knew of cells' ability to multiply by self-division, so it is unclear how Darwin supposed the two proliferation mechanisms to relate to each other.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He did clarify in a later statement that he had always supposed gemmules to only bind to and proliferate from developing cells, not mature ones.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/?docId=letters/DCP-LETT-6442.xml;query=gemmule;brand=default|title=To Scientific Opinion|last=Darwin|first=Charles|date=October 20, 1869|work=Darwin Correspondence Project|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin hypothesized that gemmules might be able to survive and multiply outside of the body in a letter to J.

[[File:Gemmule cell proliferation (pangenesis).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Darwin's description of cell proliferation using pangenesis theory in ''The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication'']]

Some gemmules were thought to remain dormant for generations, whereas others were routinely expressed by all offspring. Every child was built up from selective expression of the mixture of the parents and grandparents' gemmules coming from either side. Darwin likened this to gardening: a flowerbed could be sprinkled with seeds "most of which soon germinate, some lie for a period dormant, whilst others perish."{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=276}} He did not claim gemmules were in the blood, although his theory was often interpreted in this way. Responding to [[Fleming Jenkin]]'s review of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', he argued that pangenesis would permit the preservation of some favourable variations in a population so that they wouldn't die out through blending.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=283}}

Darwin thought that environmental effects that caused altered characteristics would lead to altered gemmules for the affected body part. The altered gemmules would then have a chance of being transferred to offspring, since they were assumed to be produced throughout an organisms life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, pangenesis theory allowed for the Lamarckian idea of transmission of characteristics acquired through use and disuse. Accidental gemmule development in incorrect parts of the body could explain deformations and the 'monstrosities' Darwin cited in ''Variation''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== De Vries ===
[[Hugo de Vries]] characterized his own version of pangenesis theory in his 1889 book ''Intracellular Pangenesis'' with two propositions, of which he only accepted the first:

:I. In the cells there are numberless particles which differ from each other, and represent the individual cells, organs, functions and qualities of the whole individual. These particles are much larger than the chemical molecules and smaller than the smallest known organisms; yet they are for the most part comparable to the latter, because, like them, they can divide and multiply through nutrition and growth. They are transmitted, during cell-division, to the daughter-cells: this is the ordinary process of heredity.
:II. In addition to this, the cells of the organism, at every stage of development, throw off such particles, which are conducted to the germ-cells and transmit to them those characters which the respective cells may have acquired during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Vries|first=Hugo|title=Intracellular Pangenesis|url=http://www.esp.org/books/devries/pangenesis/facsimile/|accessdate=May 2, 2015|date=1910|origyear=1889|page=63|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vries also coined the term 'pangene' which 20 years later was shortened by [[Wilhelm Johannsen]] to [[gene]].

=== Other variants ===
Science historian [[E. Janet Browne|Janet Browne]] points out that while [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Carl von Nägeli]] also put forth ideas for systems of inheritance involving gemmules, their version of gemmules differed in that it contained "a complete microscopic blueprint for an entire creature."{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=281}} Spencer published his theory of "physiological units" three years prior to Darwin's publication of ''Variation''.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt;

She goes on to say that Darwin believed specifically in gemmules for each body part because they might explain how environmental effects could be passed on as characteristics to offspring.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=281}}

Interpretations and applications of pangenesis continued to appear frequently in medical literature up until [[August Weismann|Weismann's]] experiments and subsequent publication on germ-plasm theory in 1892.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1935" /&gt; For instance, an address by Huxley spurred on substantial work by Dr. James Ross in linking ideas found in Darwin's pangenesis to the [[germ theory of disease]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Graft Theory of Disease: Being an Application of Mr. Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis to the Explanation of the Phenomena of the Zymotic Diseases|last=Ross|first=James|publisher=Lindsay and Blakiston|year=1872|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross cites the work of both Darwin and Spencer as key to his application of pangenetic theory.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Collapse ==

=== Galton's experiments on rabbits ===
Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]] conducted wide-ranging inquiries into heredity which led him to refute Charles Darwin's hypothetical theory of pangenesis. In consultation with Darwin, he set out to see if gemmules were transported in the blood.  In a long series of experiments from 1869 to 1871, he transfused the blood between dissimilar breeds of rabbits, and examined the features of their offspring. He found no evidence of characters transmitted in the transfused blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bulmer|2003|pp=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Galton|Galton]] was troubled because he began the work in good faith, intending to prove Darwin right, and having praised pangenesis in ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869. Cautiously, he criticized his cousin’s theory, although qualifying his remarks by saying that Darwin's gemmules, which he called "pangenes," might be temporary inhabitants of the blood that his experiments had failed to pick up.{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=291–292}}

Darwin challenged the validity of Galton's experiment, giving his reasons in an article published in ''Nature'' where he wrote:&lt;ref name=Darwin1871&gt;{{cite journal |author=Darwin, Charles R. |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=27 April 1871 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1751&amp;viewtype=side&amp;pageseq=1 |title=Pangenesis |journal=Nature.

{{quote|Now, in the chapter on Pangenesis in my ''Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,'' I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any circulating system. It is, indeed, obvious that the presence of gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood." He goes on to admit: "Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.&lt;ref name=Darwin1871/&gt;}}

After the circulation of Galton's results, the perception of pangenesis quickly changed to severe skepticism if not outright disbelief.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[August Weismann]]'s idea, set out in his 1892 book ''Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung'' (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/weismann_keimplasma_1892|title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung|author=Weismann, August|date=1892|publisher=Fischer|location=Jena|trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A theory of inheritance}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that the hereditary material, which he called the [[germ plasm]], and the rest of the body (the [[Somatic (biology)|soma]]) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. This distinction is commonly referred to as the [[Weismann barrier|Weismann Barrier]]. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails across multiple generations, was proposed as a proof of the non-existence of Lamarckian inheritance, although Peter Gauthier has argued that [[Weismann's experiment]] showed only that injury did not affect the germ plasm and neglected to test the effect of Lamarckian use and disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gauthier|first=Peter|date=March–May 1990|title=Does Weismann's Experiment Constitute a Refutation of the Lamarckian Hypothesis?|journal=BIOS|volume=61|pages=6–8|jstor=4608123|number=1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weismann argued strongly and dogmatically for Darwinism and against neo-Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40193707|title=Neo-Lamarckism and the evolution controversy in France, 1870-1920|last=1940-|first=Persell, Stuart Michael,|date=1999|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=077348275X|location=Lewiston, NY|oclc=40193707}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to [[Eclipse of Darwinism|its eclipse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution: The History of an Idea|last=Bowler|first=Peter J.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-520-23693-6|edition=3rd completely rev. and expanded|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=253–256|authorlink=Peter J.

=== After pangenesis ===

Darwin's pangenesis theory was widely criticised, in part for its [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] premise that parents could [[inheritance of acquired characters|pass on traits acquired]] in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|last2=Li|first2=Xiuju|date=2014-09-23|title=Has Darwin's Pangenesis Been Rediscovered?|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/11/1037/2754242|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=64|issue=11|pages=1037–1041|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu151|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the neo-Lamarckians of the time seized upon pangenesis as evidence to support their case.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Italian Botanist Federico Delpino's objection that gemmules' ability to self-divide is contrary to their supposedly innate nature gained considerable traction; however, Darwin was dismissive of this criticism, remarking that the particulate agents of small pox and scarlet fever seem to have such characteristics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lamarckism fell from favour after [[August Weismann]]'s research in the 1880s indicated that changes from use (such as lifting weights to increase muscle mass) and disuse (such as being lazy and becoming weak) were not heritable.&lt;ref name="ImaginaryLamarck"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.textbookleague.org/ |title=The Textbook Letter |last=Ghiselin |first=Michael T. |publisher=The Textbook League |publication-date=September–October 1994 |contribution=Nonsense in schoolbooks: 'The Imaginary Lamarck' |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |accessdate=2008-01-23 |contribution-url=http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q |title=A History of the Life Sciences |last=Magner |first=Lois N. |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]], [[CRC Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-203-91100-6 |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some scientists continued to voice their support  in spite of Galton's and Weismann's results: notably, in 1900 Karl Pearson wrote that pangenesis "is no more disproved by the statement that ‘gemmules have not been found in the blood,’ than the atomic theory is disproved by the fact that no atoms have been found in the air."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=PSwRAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=The+Grammar+of+Science&amp;ots=T5EHpFM1SO&amp;sig=1AasXoTNJ_snuqbDZwDknU7ilks#v=snippet&amp;q=atomic%20theory&amp;f=false|title=The Grammar of Science|last=Pearson|first=Karl|publisher=Adam and Charles Black|year=1900|isbn=9785877362529|location=London|pages=335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the rediscovery of Mendel's Laws of Inheritance in 1900 led to pangenesis being fully set aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Beer|first1=Gavin|title=Charles Darwin: A Scientific Biography|date=1965|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company|location=Garden City, NY|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Huxley has observed that the later discovery of [[chromosome]]s and the research of [[T.

Some of Darwin's pangenesis principles do relate to heritable aspects of [[phenotypic plasticity]], although the status of gemmules as a distinct class of organic particles has been firmly rejected. However, starting in the 1950s, many research groups in revisiting Galton's experiments found that heritable characteristics could indeed arise in rabbits and chickens following DNA injection or blood transfusion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Yongsheng|date=2008|title=A new perspective on Darwin's Pangenesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00036.x|journal=Biological Reviews|volume=83|issue=2|pages=141–149|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1940's in the work of Sopikov and others, and was later corroborated by researchers in Switzerland as it was being further developed by the Soviet scientists.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosin, I.

Darwin himself had noted that "the existence of free gemmules is a gratuitous assumption"; by some accounts in modern interpretation, gemmules may be considered a prescient mix of DNA, RNA, proteins, prions, and other mobile elements that are heritable in a non-Mendelian manner at the molecular level.&lt;ref name="Geison69" /&gt;&lt;ref name="West=Eberhard08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West-Eberhard |first1=M.

'''Peace testimony''', or '''testimony against war''', is a shorthand description of the action generally taken by members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) for peace and against participation in war. Like other [[Quakers#Practical theology|Quaker testimonies]], it is not a "belief", but a description of committed actions, in this case to promote peace, and refrain from and actively oppose participation in war.  Quakers' original refusal to bear arms has been broadened to embrace protests and demonstrations in opposition to government policies of war and confrontations with others who bear arms, whatever the reason, in the support of [[peace]] and active [[nonviolence]].  Because of this core testimony, the Religious Society of Friends is considered one of the traditional [[peace churches]].

== General explanation ==
[[File:QuakersPennsylvanie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Quakers in Pennsylvania meeting with Native Americans]]
[[Religious Society of Friends|Friends']] peace testimony is largely derived from beliefs arising from the teachings of [[Jesus]] to love one's enemies and Friends' belief in the [[inner light]].  Quakers believe that nonviolent confrontation of evil and peaceful reconciliation are always superior to violent measures.  Peace testimony does not mean that Quakers engage only in passive resignation; in fact, they often practice passionate activism.

The Peace Testimony is probably the best known testimony of Friends. The belief that violence is wrong has persisted to this day, and many [[conscientious objector]]s, advocates of [[non-violence]] and [[anti-war]] activists are Friends. Because of their peace testimony, Friends are considered as one of the historic [[peace church]]es. In 1947 Friends as a worldwide religious group were awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], which was accepted by the [[American Friends Service Committee]] and the then London Yearly Meeting's Friends Service Committee, now called Britain Yearly Meeting [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness|Peace &amp; Social Witness]] on behalf of all Friends. The Peace Testimony has not always been well received in the world; on many occasions Friends have been imprisoned for refusing to serve in military activities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Some Friends today regard the Peace Testimony in even a broader sense, [[tax resistance|refusing to pay the portion of the income tax]] that goes to fund the military. Yearly Meetings in the United States, Britain and other parts of the world endorse and support these Friends' actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Quaker Faith &amp; Practice | publisher = Britain Yearly Meeting | date = 1999 | pages = 1.02.31 | isbn = 0-85245-306-X | author = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quaker Council for European Affairs]] campaigns in the European Parliament for the right of conscientious objectors in Europe not to be made to pay for the military. Some do pay the money into peace charities and still get goods seized by bailiffs or money taken from their bank accounts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In America, others pay into an [[escrow]] account in the name of the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which the IRS can only access if they give an assurance that the money will only be used for peaceful purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyym.org/purchasequarter/peacetax.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Yearly meetings in the US run escrow accounts for conscientious objectors, both within and outside the Society.

Many Friends engage in various non-governmental organizations such as [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]] serving in some of the most violent areas of the world. Quaker author [[Howard Brinton]], for example, served in the American Friends Service Committee during World War I.

== Development of Quaker beliefs about peace ==
{{See also|Christian pacifism}}
[[George Fox]], perhaps the most influential early Quaker, made a declaration in 1651 that many see as the first declaration of Friends' beliefs on peace:
&lt;ref name=fox&gt;[http://www.quaker.org/minnfm/peace/fox_1651.htm Fox 1651]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1660 [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of King Charles II]] and a clamp-down on religious radical groups such as the [[Fifth Monarchists]], 
:I told [the Commonwealth Commissioners] I lived in the virtue of that life and power that took away the occasion of all wars and I knew from whence all wars did rise, from the lust, according to James's doctrine... I told them I was come into the covenant of peace which was before wars and strifes were. 

A number of letters and statements were written this year, as much to remove any suspicion that Friends might have been involved in violent political activity as a desire to make their position clear. Margaret Fell wrote a letter to King Charles II that was co-signed "in unity" by a number of prominent Friends, including Fox:

:We are a people that follow after those things that make for peace, love, and unity; it is our desire that others' feet may walk in the same, and do deny and bear our testimony against all strife, and wars, and contentions that come from the lusts that war in the members, that war against the soul, which we wait for and watch for in all people, and love and desire the good of all.&lt;ref name="full text"&gt;''A declaration from the harmless and innocent people of God, called Quakers'', London: 1660, as quoted in: Britain Yearly Meeting [Ed] ''[http://www.qhpress.org/quakerpages/qwhp/mf2king.htm Margaret Fell's Letter to the King on Persecution]'', 1660&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well-known statement of this belief &lt;ref name="fox 2"&gt;from [http://www.hallvworthington.com/gfjournal6b.html#peace George Fox's Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; was stated later that year in a declaration to King [[Charles II of England]] in 1660 by George Fox and 11 others. This excerpt is commonly cited:

:All bloody principles and practices we do utterly deny, with all outward wars, and strife, and fightings with outward weapons, for any end, or under any pretence whatsoever, and this is our testimony to the whole world. That [[spirit of Christ]] by which we are guided is not changeable, so as once to command us from a thing as evil and again to move unto it; and we do certainly know, and so testify to the world, that the spirit of Christ, which leads us into all Truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdoms of this world.&lt;ref name="full text two"&gt;''A declaration from the harmless and innocent people of God, called Quakers'', London: 1660, as quoted in: Britain Yearly Meeting [Ed] ''Quaker Faith and Practice: the book of Christian discipline of the Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends in Britain'' London: 1994,  24:04.
The extract quoted is considerably abridged from the original declaration - full text of the original declaration is available: [http://www.quaker.org/minnfm/peace/A%20Declaration%20to%20Charles%20II%201660.htm A Declaration from the harmless and innocent people of God, called Quakers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Quakers initially opposed this statement because it did not deny use of the sword to the magistrate or ruler of the state.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}  It also contained no prohibition against paying taxes for purposes of war, something that would trouble Friends to the present.

== Friends' testimony to peace ==
[[File:NobelPrize2.jpg|thumb|right|In 1947, the Religious Society of Friends was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. The peace testimony of Friends is their best known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1947/press.html The Nobel Peace Prize 1947 - Presentation Speech&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Quakers have engaged in peace testimony by protesting against wars, refusing to serve in armed forces if drafted, seeking [[conscientious objector]] status when available, and even to participating in acts of [[civil disobedience]]. Not all Quakers embrace this testimony as an absolute; for example, there were Friends that fought in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. Some others were firm [[:Category:Christian pacifists|Christian pacifists]]. During extreme circumstances it has been difficult for some Quakers to engage in and uphold this testimony, yet Friends have almost universally been committed to the ideal of peace, even those who have felt the need to compromise on their testimony. Apart from the specific question of war, other ways in which [[Religious Society of Friends|Friends]] have testified to peace have included [[vegetarianism]] and a commitment to [[restorative justice]].

The Religious Society of Friends was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1947.  The Nobel Prize was awarded to Friends for Friends' work to relieve suffering and feed many millions of starving people during and after both world wars. The Nobel prize was accepted by the [[American Friends Service Committee]], along with the UK's [[Quaker Peace and Social Witness|Friends Service Council]] on behalf of all Quakers.

The first paragraph of the Presentation Speech reads:
"The Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament has awarded this year's Peace Prize to the Quakers, represented by their two great relief organizations, the Friends Service Council in London and the American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia."&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1947/press.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''Persianism''' is used to describe any process of forming or transforming a phenomenon into something which has [[Iranian peoples|Persian]] (Iranian) traits and peculiarities.

Persianism can also mean a school of thought which emphasises the study of Persian culture and informing others about it. It is said by the scholar Ofira Seliktar that Shi'ism and Persianism overlap in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;P. 138 ''Failing the crystal ball test the Carter administration and the fundamentalist revolution in Iran'' by Ofira Seliktar;  NetLibrary, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar [[Muhammad Iqbal]] wrote, "''The conquest of Persia meant not the conversion of Persia to Islam, but the conversion of Islam to Persianism!''"&lt;ref&gt;P. 82 ''Thoughts and Reflections of Iqbal.'' By Muhammad Iqbal&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of how the Persians regained governance of their country, the scholar [[Philip Khuri Hitti]] writes, "Arabianism fell, but Islam under a new guise, that of Persianism, marched on triumphantly."&lt;ref&gt;P. 536 ''History of Syria, Including Lebanon and Palestine'' By Phillip K. Hitti&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of linguistics, Persianism is the [[Persian language|Persian]] pronunciation of a word.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9232">'''Philosophical analysis''' (from {{lang-el|Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση}}) is the techniques typically used by [[philosopher]]s in the [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]] that involve "breaking down" (i.e. analyzing) philosophical issues. Arguably the most prominent of these techniques is the analysis of [[concept]]s (known as ''conceptual analysis'').

==Method of analysis==
While analysis is characteristic of the analytic tradition in philosophy, what is to be analyzed (the ''analysandum'') often varies. Some philosophers focus on analyzing linguistic phenomena, such as [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], while others focus on psychological phenomena, such as [[sense data]]. However, arguably the most prominent analyses are of concepts or [[proposition]]s, which is known as ''conceptual analysis'' (Foley 1996).

Conceptual analysis consists primarily in breaking down or analyzing concepts into their constituent parts in order to gain knowledge or a better understanding of a particular philosophical issue in which the concept is involved (Beaney 2003). For example, the [[problem of free will]] in philosophy involves various key concepts, including the concepts of freedom, moral responsibility, determinism, ability, etc. The method of conceptual analysis tends to approach such a problem by breaking down the key concepts pertaining to the problem and seeing how they interact. Thus, in the long-standing debate on whether [[free will]] is compatible with the doctrine of [[determinism]], several philosophers have proposed analyses of the relevant concepts to argue for either [[compatibilism]] or [[incompatibilism]].

A famous author of conceptual analysis at its best is Bertrand Russell's [[theory of descriptions]]. Russell attempted to analyze propositions that involved ''definite descriptions'' (such as "The tallest spy"), which pick out a unique individual, and ''indefinite descriptions'' (such as "a spy"), which pick out a set of individuals. Take Russell's analysis of definite descriptions as an example.&lt;ref&gt;Note that this explication is only of a part of Russell's theory of descriptions and is quite brief and oversimplified.&lt;/ref&gt; Superficially, definite descriptions have the standard subject-predicate form of a proposition. For example, "The present [[king of France]] is [[baldness|bald]]" appears to be predicating "baldness" of the subject "the present king of France". However, Russell noted that this is problematic, because there is no present king of France (France is [[France#Republics and Empires (1792-)|no longer a monarchy]]). Normally, to decide whether a proposition of the standard subject-predicate form is true or false, one checks whether the subject is in the extension of the predicate. The proposition is then true if and only if the subject is in the extension of the predicate. The problem is that there is no present king of France, so the present king of France cannot be found on the list of bald things or non-bald things. So, it would appear that the proposition expressed by "The present king of France is bald" is neither true nor false. However, analyzing the relevant concepts and propositions, Russell proposed that what definite descriptions really express are not propositions of the subject-predicate form, but rather they express existentially quantified propositions. Thus, "The present king of France" is ''analyzed'', according to Russell's theory of descriptions, as "There exists an individual who is currently the king of France, there is only one such individual, and that individual is bald." Now one can determine the [[truth value]] of the proposition. Indeed, it is false, because it is not the case that there exists a unique individual who is currently the king of France and is bald—since there is no present king of France (Bertolet 1999).

==Controversy==
While the method of analysis is characteristic of contemporary analytic philosophy, its status continues to be a source of great controversy even among analytic philosophers. Several current criticisms of the analytic method derive from W.V. Quine's famous rejection of the [[analytic–synthetic distinction]]. While Quine's critique is well-known, it is highly controversial.

Further, the analytic method seems to rely on some sort of definitional structure of concepts, so that one can give necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept. For example, the concept "bachelor" is often analyzed as having the concepts "unmarried" and "male" as its components. Thus, the definition or analysis of "bachelor" is thought to be an unmarried male. But one might worry that these so-called necessary and sufficient conditions do not apply in every case. Wittgenstein, for instance, argues that language (e.g., the word 'bachelor') is used for various purposes and in an indefinite number of ways. Wittgenstein's famous thesis states that meaning is determined by use. This means that, in each case, the meaning of 'bachelor' is determined by its use in a context. So if it can be shown that the word means different things across different contexts of use, then cases where its meaning cannot be essentially defined as 'married bachelor' seem to constitute counterexamples to this method of analysis. This is just one example of a critique of the analytic method derived from a critique of definitions. There are several other such critiques (Margolis &amp; Laurence 2006). This criticism is often said to have originated primarily with Wittgenstein's ''Philosophical Investigations''.

A third critique of the method of analysis derives primarily from psychological critiques of [[intuition (psychology)|intuition]]. A key part of the analytic method involves analyzing concepts via "intuition tests". Philosophers tend to motivate various conceptual analyses by appeal to their intuitions about thought experiments. (See DePaul and Ramsey (1998) for a collection of current essays on the controversy over analysis as it relates to intuition and [[reflective equilibrium]].)

In short, some philosophers feel strongly that the analytic method (especially conceptual analysis) is essential to and defines philosophy—e.g. Jackson (1998), Chalmers (1996), and Bealer (1998). Yet, some philosophers argue that the method of analysis is problematic—e.g. Stich (1998) and Ramsey (1998). Some, however, take the middle ground and argue that while analysis is largely a fruitful method of inquiry, philosophers should not limit themselves to only using the method of analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9387">The '''philosophy of chemistry''' considers the [[methodology]] and underlying assumptions of the [[science]] of [[chemistry]].  It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams.  For much of its history, [[philosophy of science]] has been dominated by the [[philosophy of physics]], but the [[philosophy|philosophical]] questions that arise from chemistry have received increasing attention since the latter part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Weisberg"&gt;Weisberg, M. (2001). [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/why-not-a-philosophy-of-chemistry Why not a philosophy of chemistry?] ''American Scientist.''

Retrieved April 10, 2009 from http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00000254/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundations of chemistry==
Major philosophical questions arise as soon as one attempts to define chemistry and what it studies.  [[Atom]]s and [[molecule]]s are often assumed to be the fundamental units of chemical theory,&lt;ref name="Schummer"&gt;Schummer, Joachim. (2006). Philosophy of science. In ''Encyclopedia of philosophy, second edition.'' New York, NY: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; but traditional descriptions of molecular structure and [[chemical bond]]ing fail to account for the properties of many substances, including [[metallic bond|metals]] and [[Coordination complex#Electronic properties of metal complexes|metal complexes]]&lt;ref name="Gammon"&gt;Ebbing, D., &amp; Gammon, S. (2005). ''General chemistry.'' Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aromaticity]].&lt;ref name="PLK"&gt;Pavia, D., Lampman, G., &amp; Kriz, G. (2004). ''Organic chemistry, volume 1.'' Mason, OH: Cenage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, chemists frequently use non-existent chemical entities like [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance structures]]&lt;ref name="Gammon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PLK" /&gt; to explain the structure and reactions of different substances; these explanatory tools use the language and graphical representations of molecules to describe the behavior of chemicals and chemical reactions that in reality do not behave as straightforward molecules.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Some chemists and philosophers of chemistry prefer to think of substances, rather than microstructures, as the fundamental units of study in chemistry.  There is not always a one-to-one correspondence between the two methods of classifying substances.&lt;ref name="Schummer" /&gt;  For example, many rocks exist as mineral complexes composed of multiple ions that do not occur in fixed proportions or spatial relationships to one another.&lt;ref name="Gammon" /&gt;

A related philosophical problem is whether chemistry is the study of substances or reactions.&lt;ref name="Schummer" /&gt;  Atoms, even in a solid, are in perpetual motion and under the right conditions many chemicals react spontaneously to form new products.  A variety of environmental variables contribute to a substance's properties, including temperature and pressure, proximity to other molecules and the presence of a magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Schummer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gammon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PLK" /&gt;  As Schummer puts it, "Substance philosophers define a chemical reaction by the change of certain substances, whereas process philosophers define a substance by its characteristic chemical reactions."&lt;ref name="Schummer" /&gt;

Philosophers of chemistry discuss issues of [[symmetry]] and [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] in nature. [[organic chemistry|Organic]] (i.e., [[carbon]]-based) [[molecule]]s are those most often chiral. [[Amino acid]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s and [[sugar]]s, all of which are found exclusively as a single [[enantiomer]] in organisms, are the basic chemical units of [[life]]. [[Chemists]], [[biochemistry|biochemists]], and [[biologists]] alike debate the origins of this [[homochirality]]. Philosophers debate facts regarding the origin of this phenomenon, namely whether it emerged contingently, amid a lifeless [[racemic]] environment or if other processes were at play. Some speculate that answers can only be found in comparison to [[extraterrestrial life]], if it is ever found. Other philosophers question whether there exists a bias toward assumptions of nature as symmetrical, thereby causing resistance to any evidence to the contrary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

One of the most topical issues is determining to what extent physics, specifically, quantum mechanics, explains chemical phenomena. Can chemistry, in fact, be reduced to physics as has been assumed by many, or are there inexplicable gaps? Some authors, for example, [[Roald Hoffmann]],&lt;ref&gt;The Same and Not the Same (Columbia, 1995, pp. 19-20)&lt;/ref&gt; have recently suggested that a number of difficulties exist in the reductionist program with concepts like aromaticity, pH, reactivity, nucleophilicity, for example. The noted philosopher of science, [[Karl Popper]], among others, predicted as much.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Philosophers of chemistry==
Several [[philosophers]] and [[scientists]] have focused on the philosophy of chemistry in recent years, notably, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] philosopher [[Jaap van Brakel]], who wrote ''The Philosophy of Chemistry'' in 2000, and the [[Malta|Maltese]] philosopher-chemist [[Eric Scerri]], editor of the journal "Foundations of Chemistry" and author of ''Normative and Descriptive Philosophy of Science and the Role of Chemistry in Philosophy of Chemistry'', 2004, among other articles.  Scerri is especially interested in the philosophical foundations of the [[periodic table]], and how physics and chemistry intersect in relation to it, which he contends is not merely a matter for science, but for philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scerri

Although in other fields of science students of the method are generally not practitioners in the field, in chemistry (particularly in synthetic organic chemistry) intellectual method and philosophical foundations are often explored by investigators with active research programmes.  [[Elias James Corey]] developed the concept of "[[retrosynthesis]]" published a seminal work "The logic of chemical synthesis" which deconstructs these thought processes and speculates on computer-assisted synthesis.  Other chemists such as [[K. C. Nicolaou]] (co-author of ''Classics in Total Synthesis'') have followed in his lead.

'''Same-sex intimacy''' refers to a relationship between two friends of the same sex that has many components of a sexually intimate relationship (e.g. self-disclosures, emotional expressiveness, unconditional support, physical contact and trust),&lt;ref&gt;Michael Monsour, "Meanings of Intimacy in Cross- and Same-Sex Friendships", ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'' 9, no. 2 (1992): 277.&lt;/ref&gt; but not necessarily sexual intimacy or sexual contact.  The term can apply to the exploration of sexuality outside the home, as well as to the physical activities shared between two friends.&lt;ref&gt;John D'Emilio and Estelle B. Freedman, ''Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1988), 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary applications include the "[[bromance]]" culture, referring intimate bonds formed between male friends in films such as ''[[I Love You, Man]]'', as well as the familial bonds exhibited by close female friends, propagated in the mainstream media by television shows such as ''[[Sex and the City]]''.

== History ==

=== Historical context ===
{{See also|Sexuality of Abraham Lincoln}}
In ''Love Stories: Sex Between Men Before Homosexuality'', American [[LGBT]] historian [[Jonathan Ned Katz]] explores notable incidents of same-sex love prior to the creation of the word "[[homosexual]]"—a time that Katz describes as "the universe before that great sexual divide."&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, ''x''&lt;/ref&gt;  Katz's research suggests that prior to distinguishing this [[Wikt:binary|binary]] (heterosexual-homosexual), men felt freer to explore feelings of intense intimacy for other men without feeling judged or stigmatized by societal views. Katz writes, "We may refer to early-nineteenth-century men's acts or desires as gay or [[Heterosexuality|straight]], homosexual, [[heterosexual]], or [[bisexual]], but that places their behaviors and lusts within our sexual system, not the system of their time."&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  One example that Katz examines in his book is the relationship between [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his friend [[Joshua Fry Speed]]. In 1837, the two men began rooming together their first night of meeting, sharing Speed's double bed for the sake of logic and convenience, and quickly developed a close relationship. The two maintained an intimate bond until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's death]] in 1865. Although there is no evidence that Lincoln and Speed had a sexual physical relationship, Speed once stated about his relationship with Lincoln that "no men were ever more intimate."&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual policing ===

Throughout the 1700s, there was an extensive sexual policing of young people. The restrictions in place included mandatory chaperones when on dates and attending public events, as well as other socially acceptable customs such as [[bundling (tradition)|bundling]]. The latter refers to times when a male courter would spend the night in the same bed as his female companion—which was often both necessary and practical, as many courters lived a fair distance from their love interests and the majority of homes had limited beds. When bundling, both partners remained fully clothed and wrapped in separate blankets, sometimes with a "bundling board" between their bodies, to ensure that no sexual activity would take place.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Many intimate same-sex friendships were developed as a response to such sexual policing practices. Intimate relationships between friends were considered a socially acceptable method of sexual expression outside of marriage, as well an outlet for emotional desire that was otherwise limited at this time.

In ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', [[Michel Foucault]] explores the theory of the [[repressive hypothesis]]: the belief that throughout the 1800s, sex was not spoken about because of the heavy sexual policing taking place throughout the [[Victorian Era]]. Foucault argues that the Repressive Hypothesis was hypocritical and inaccurate, as, in actuality, sex was discussed at great lengths at this time.&lt;ref name=Repressive&gt;Michel Foucault, "The Repressive Hypothesis", ''The History of Sexuality: An Introduction'' (New York: Vintage, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;  The restrictions, Foucault argued, were in reference to who was permitted to discuss sex and desire and in what situation.&lt;ref name=Repressive/&gt;  For instance, citizens were encouraged to disclose their sexual desires and fantasies to Catholic priests in the name of repentance. Foucault's research on the repressive hypothesis and similar myths about how sexuality was discussed and perceived in the Victorian Era demonstrates further how sexual practices were policed, regulated, and monitored by those in power.

=== Sodomy ===

In the 1800s, "[[sodomy]]" referred to a number of sexual activities that were perceived as deviant. These acts included anal and oral sex outside of marriage, bestiality, masturbation, the "spending of your seed upon another man," and the corrupting youth to partake in any of these activities.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 30-31"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;  Officially, these acts were punishable by death, but [[sodomy|sodomites]] were seldom executed for their crimes. This is because these actions were seen as singular acts for which one could repent. Instead, most offenders were whipped publicly, burned with hot irons, or banished from their towns. All of these punishments were determined and carried out by the church.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 30-31"/&gt;  None of these activities branded an individual a "sodomite", for example, but rather as an individual who committed an act of sodomy.

=== Courtly love and sonnet writing ===

At its conception, the term "[[courtly love]]" referred to the extensive code created to control the intense feelings of love between a knight and a married woman of a higher social standing.&lt;ref&gt;Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s.v. "Courtly love," (8th ed., Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  The knight in question would perform great acts of bravery in her name in order to demonstrate his love for her from afar. In later years, the definition of "courtly love" expanded to signify any admiration for a peer and, further, the notion that it was an acceptable form of admiration to create writings or art about your beloved.

The most notable example of frequent and common instances of courtly love occurs in the writings of [[William Shakespeare]]. Shakespeare wrote many sonnets to young men that he admired, praising their beauty, intelligence and virility.&lt;ref&gt;Rictor Norton, [http://rictornorton.co.uk/shakespe.htm "Enter Willie Hughes as Juliet: Or, Shakespeare's Sonnets Revisited"] Gay History and Literature Canon, last modified June 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   He addressed sonnets 1-126 to "Fair Youth"—an individual who is commonly interpreted to be male—and later, in Sonnet 20, refers to the boy as the "master-mistress of [his] passion."&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, [http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/179/the-sonnets/3259/sonnet-20/ "Sonnet 20"] ''The Sonnets'', Lit2Go Edition (1609)&lt;/ref&gt; Additional examples of Shakespeare writing of same-sex intimacy and courtly love are within his [[procreation sonnets]]. In these poems, Shakespeare encourages a young man to marry and have children to preserve his beauty, using loving and occasionally romantic language to communicate his message.&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, [http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/179/the-sonnets/3240/sonnet-1/ "Sonnet 1"] ''The Sonnets'', Lit2Go Edition, (1609)&lt;/ref&gt;   Additionally, it is believed by many scholars that Shakespeare's famous [[Sonnet 18]] ("Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?") is also about a man, as he dedicated his book of sonnets to an unidentified "Mr. W.H."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Foster, "Master W.H., R.I.P." PMLA 102 (1987): 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Same-sex and "free love" communes ===

While sexuality was heavily policed and regulated in the 1600s, there were many individuals who disagreed with government policies and who opted to rebel. The most notable example of such an instance is [[Thomas Morton (colonist)|Thomas Morton]], an English adventurer who wished to live outside of the family-centric, religion-driven settlements being created by the Christian pilgrims. In 1625, Morton founded [[Merrymount (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Merrymount]]: a commune that opposed the beliefs that he so despised.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  His followers practiced interracial, pre- and extra-marital relationships, polygamy, as well as many forms of same-sex intimacy, union, and sexual expression.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The acceptance of same-sex contact within this context helped to lay the groundwork for same-sex communes that followed.

In the 1860s, [[Martha McWhirter]], a married woman living in Belton, Texas, established a community for women who wished to live together away from their husbands, either permanently or part-time. McWhirter's commune allowed for married women to experience emotional relationships without the risk of pregnancy, as well as experience "sensual pleasures" such as mineral baths and other soothing exercises amidst the company of other women.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 81"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 81&lt;/ref&gt;  While not strictly an expression of same-sex intimacy, this community allowed a socially acceptable way for women to explore friendships and their personal erotic desires outside of the confines of heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 81"/&gt;

== Exploring sexuality outside marriage and the family ==

While same-sex intimate friendships gave the participants a much-needed confidant and companion, the realization of self outside of one's family was also important to the formation of these friendships. Following the period of time in which families lived in one room and children learned about sexuality from their parents,&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 56&lt;/ref&gt;  a different outlet was necessary for sexual growth among youth.  Oftentimes, the practice of a same-sex intimate friendship mirrored that of a heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, this was considered a socially acceptable method of seeking companionship outside of marriage. As a result, often men and women were encouraged to find companions to spend time with.

=== Academia ===

[[Boarding school]]s and [[women's college]]s encouraged same-sex intimate friendships because of limited access to males and "socializ[ation]…into a world which valued female sensibility and female bonds."&lt;ref name="D'Emilio  191"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 191&lt;/ref&gt;  Within boarding schools girls formed strong bonds with each other in the absence of other outlets for their emotions and impulses.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio  191"/&gt;  "Smashing" was a term used during the 1860s and 1870s to describe the intensely romantic relationships paralleling heterosexual courtship formed between young women in formal academic settings.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 126"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 126&lt;/ref&gt;  In "Smashing: Women’s Relationships Before the Fall", [[Nancy Sahli]] writes "…when a Vassar girl takes a shine to another she straightaway enters upon a regular course of bouquet sendings, interspersed with tinted notes…candies, locks of hair perhaps, and many other tender tokens, until at last the object of her attentions is captured, the two become inseparable, and the aggressor is considered by her circle of acquaintances as—''smashed''."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Sahli, "Smashing: Women's Relationships Before the Fall", ''Chrysalis'' 8 (1979): 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Having a crush on, or strong feelings for another girl was common, and celebrated within magazines and other works of fiction.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio  191"/&gt;

It was the first time for many women in college that they were away from their families and in the public sphere and most were socializing or living with other women who had similar interests and aspirations.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 192"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 192&lt;/ref&gt;  There was no longer a requirement to wed if a woman decided to become an academic and, because of this, women felt free to continue living with their female companions indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 193&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[Boston marriage]]s", or partnerships in which women lived and worked together, shared a bed, and planned how to spend their money together, became commonplace. Many professional, young women opted for this arrangement in order to remain financially and emotionally independent of male support.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 192"/&gt;

College also supported intimate same-sex friendships between males for similar reasons (i.e.: ventures out in to the public sphere, distance from families, easier access to entertainment and friends). Fraternities offered an opportunity for men to live together easily and develop bonds with other males while living in close quarters.

=== Related physical intimacy ===

[[Bosom sex]] was often practised between young women. This refers to the act of revealing or fondling of the breasts by a female companion, often while in bed. Bosom sex signified a deep bond and trust between the women performing it. While this practice was not inherently sexual, it is one of the more documented forms of physical intimacy within same sex intimate friendships and today would certainly be categorized as a sexual act.&lt;ref name="Hansen 160-61"&gt;Karen V. Hansen, "'No Kisses Is Like Youres': An Erotic Friendship Between Two African-American Women During the Mid-Nineteenth Century", ''Gender &amp; History'' 7, no. 2. (1995): 160-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[No Kisses Is Like Youres]]", Professor [[Karen V. Hansen]] discusses the relationship between Rebecca Primus and Addie Brown: two African American women who shared an intimate long-distance friendship in the 1860s that spanned over nine years and took place mostly through correspondence.&lt;ref name="Hansen 160-61"/&gt;  The preserved letters from this time articulate a friendship that was loving and supportive, and, at times, sexually-charged. Addie writes fondly of her memories sharing a bed with Rebecca and of the incidents of "bosom sex" that they experienced together.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1995, 160&lt;/ref&gt;  Addie also frequently refers to Rebecca as her "beloved", writing, "Yours {{sic|for ever}}, until death parts us."&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 1995, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often held hands, kissed, or caressed while in private settings with other women. This behaviour was acceptable and often encouraged within society as long as these women made no genital contact, the actions were done in a private setting, and such intimacy was not performed in front of men.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 126"/&gt;  Therefore, it was not unusual for women to write notes that mirrored the style and content of love letters to each other, even if one or both of the correspondents were married.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 127"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 127&lt;/ref&gt;  Women often made statements in these letters that they had the desire to make love to one another, which expressed a desire to court and not necessarily to touch.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Anna and [[Emily Dickinson]] both often wrote to married friends expressing their desire to be with their female counterparts, and anxiety to be so far away from each other.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 127"/&gt;

Working class girls, who were experiencing a separation from their family and the ability to venture out into the public sphere for the first time, also found other ways to explore and express their sexuality. Along with intimacy in same-sex friendships, women would often attend [[cabarets]] together, or else avail themselves of the readily available entertainments in the city.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 130&lt;/ref&gt;  They may even attend a [[peepshow]] together, bringing their intimacy into the public by viewing other women together in a sexual light.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Young men also often put themselves in hypersexual situations with their intimate same-sex friends, without directly being sexual with them.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;   In ''[[Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America]]'', [[John D'Emilio]] specifically references Fred Ryman and his friend Claude Macy, whom Ryman "can truly say [he] love[s]" who seek out a prostitute together.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 110&lt;/ref&gt;  This was common practice among men who experienced intimate same-sex friendships, and is a practice that has carried on in contemporary times with strip clubs and other such activities.

Whether or not there was also sexual intimacy within these relationships is debatable, as homosexuality was still observed as a punishable offense in the United States of America and the intense need to keep sexuality within the private sphere and away from the public sphere was still present.

=== Formation of homosexuality ===

In 1892, American neurologist [[Charles G. Chaddock]] wrote about same-sex desire in a German health textbook, making the first mention of the word "homosexuality". Chaddock defines homosexuality as the "great diminution or complete absence of sexual feeling for the opposite sex with the substitution of sexual feeling and instinct for the same sex." This is the general understanding we have of the word homosexual today, although at that time homosexuality was still seen as "contrary sexual instinct."&lt;ref&gt;"homosexuality, n.", OED Online, (Oxford University Press: 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the term "homosexual" and the understanding that same-sex sexual desire existed changed the meanings of same-sex intimate friendships. While there had always been some physical aspects to same-sex intimate friendships, now such acts were thrown into a negative light. Sodomy and other activities were no longer seen as single, repentable actions, but instead as a lifestyle choice.&lt;ref&gt;John D'Emilio and Estelle B. Freedman, ''Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row Publishers, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

American poet [[Walt Whitman]] identified his feelings of same-sex attraction as "[[adhesive love]]": something falling outside of same-sex intimacy because of its homoerotic undertones.  Whitman first mentions adhesive love in Leaves of Grass, referring to it as an alternative take on "manly love" or the love of men for men.&lt;ref name="Katz 109"&gt;Jonathan Ned Katz, ''Love Stories: Sex Between Men Before Homosexuality'' (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2001), 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  He expands on this feeling through several of his poems, talking about his "hot wishes" for strange men he meets in the dark.&lt;ref name="Katz 109"/&gt;  Whitman saw manly love as a sexual expression that did not necessarily go against gender binaries, but, rather, challenged the [[capitalistic]] and Christian-centric spirit of the current American democracy.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 127"/&gt;  Whitman understood adhesive love as necessary aspect of comradeship and male bonding.  He did not identify as a homosexual, as the word was not largely recognised. However, he wrote extensively about his erotic physical encounters with young men,&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 170&lt;/ref&gt; and by the end of his life had begun to question his sexual identity, as a result of some prodding by homosexual writer [[John Addington Symonds]].&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th century, homosexuality began to be recognized as something outside of church law and was discussed in the medical community.&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 226"&gt;D'Emilio 1988, 226&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexuality became an identifier of a person, the manifestation of their "[[true nature]]".&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 226"/&gt;  Terms such as "[[Third gender|third sex]]", "[[urning]]", "[[tribad]]" and "[[:wikt:Invert#Noun|invert]]" were used interchangeably with "homosexual".&lt;ref name="D'Emilio 226"/&gt;  In response, sodomy between two willing participants of legal age was officially legalized in New York State in the late 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 270&lt;/ref&gt;  However, public outrage against homosexuality, the fierce protection of Christian moral standards, and the desire to appear tough on "[[sexual perversion]]" caused all acts of sodomy to be criminalized until well into the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Katz 2001, 69&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usages ==

Same-sex intimacy has carried over into the contemporary era. Though our view of it has changed, much of what happens within intimate same-sex friendships remains the same.  The two most popular representations of intimate—and often co-dependent—same-sex friendships in modern popular culture are "bromances" among men and the "BFF" culture among women.

=== Bromance ===
{{Main|Bromance}}

Bromance, like the previous forms of same-sex intimacy, allows men to explore their sexuality and experience intimacy outside of a heterosexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth J. Chen, "Caught in a Bad Bromance", ''Texas Journal of Women and the Law'' 21, no. 2 (2012): abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bromance culture encourages men to find intimate friends or "[[heterosexual life partners]]"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', directed by Kevin Smith (1999; Santa Monica, CA: Lions Gate Entertainment), DVD&lt;/ref&gt; in order to experience the closeness and benefits of friendship. This is something that men have often been denied within constructions of modern masculinity.

One example of a bromance relationship in contemporary popular culture was portrayed in the film ''[[I Love You, Man]]'' (2009). In this movie, male characters Peter and Sydney meet and quickly develop a fast and close friendship. Peter is thrilled with his new best friend, but is also hyper-aware of the social confines and emotional restrictions of a same-sex male friendship.&lt;ref&gt;''I Love You, Man'', directed by John Hamburg (2009: Universal City, CA: DreamWorks SKG), DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;  He states, "I’m really nervous. There are no rules for male friendships."&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Whipp, "'I Love You, Man' and the Rules of Male Friendship", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (Los Angeles, CA), March 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of bromance relationships are visible in current popular culture. Examples include:

* ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'' (Dale and Saul)
* ''[[Knocked Up]]''
* ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]''
* ''[[Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle]]'' (Harold and Kumar)
* ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' (Harry and Lloyd)
* ''[[Clerks]]'', etc. (Jay and Silent Bob)
* ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'' (Evan and Seth)
* ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (Frodo and Sam)
* ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' (SpongeBob and Patrick)

=== "BFF" culture ===
{{Main|Best friends forever}}

BFF ("best friend forever") relationships are similar to bromances, but instead emphasize the close friendships between women. BFF culture is generally more socially acceptable and less stigmatized than close relationships between men, as women have been historically and socially conditioned to seek out and embrace the friendship of other women.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Simon, [http://www.blogher.com/term-bff-best-friend-forever-harmful-girls’-friendships "BFFs &amp; Mean Girls: Why Best Friends Forever Can Be Harmful to Girls"] BlogHer Editors. November 8, 2011. Accessed November 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  BFF culture can also be referred to as "[[womance]]".

One example of a BFF relationship that closely links to historical examples of same-sex intimacy is that of Meredith and Cristina on ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''. Two surgical interns, the women are drawn to each other because of the fact that they are stubborn and determined to succeed in the male dominated platform of surgery.  They become fast friends, and talk to each other about everything.  Their relationship blossoms into one of same-sex intimacy, with them hugging and holding hands when they walk, sharing a bed platonically, and later raising Meredith's daughter together while she is temporarily separated from her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Highfill,  [http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/05/14/greys-anatomy-meredith-cristina/ "'Grey's Anatomy': Why Meredith and Cristina Are the Best Female Friends on TV"] | EW.com. EW.com. May 14, 2014. Accessed November 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like bromance relationships, many different BFF relationships are visible in popular culture. Some examples of these relationships are visible in:

* ''[[Sex and the City]]''
* ''[[The Golden Girls]]''
* [[The Spice Girls]] (pop group)
* ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''
* ''[[Daria]]'' (Daria and Jane)
* ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'' (Thelma and Louise)
* ''[[Laverne and Shirley]]'' (Laverne and Shirley)
* ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]''
* [[The Suicide Girls]]

In contemporary society, the label "[[intimate partner]]" can now be applied to any individual who is in an emotionally, physically and/or mentally fulfilling relationship, be it same- or opposite-sexed, and does not necessarily apply only to those have physical sex.  Intimate partners are not defined only by sexual contact; the definition is as broad as same-sex intimate friendships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.relationships.org.au/relationship-advice/faqs/what-is-intimacy-and-why-is-it-so-important "What Is Intimacy and Why Is It so Important?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210001937/http://www.relationships.org.au/relationship-advice/faqs/what-is-intimacy-and-why-is-it-so-important |date=2015-02-10 }} - Relationships Australia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4015">[[File:John Calvin 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|John Calvin]]

'''''Sensus divinitatis''''' ("sense of divinity"), also referred to as ''sensus deitatis'' ("sense of deity") or ''semen religionis'' ("seed of religion"), is a term first used by French Protestant reformer [[John Calvin]] to describe a hypothetical human sense. Instead of knowledge of the environment (as with, for example, smell or sight), the ''sensus divinitatis'' is alleged to give humans a knowledge of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Helm | first=Paul | year=1998 | title=John Calvin, the Sensus Divinitatis, and the noetic effects of sin | journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion | volume=43 | issue=2 | pages=87–107 | doi=10.1023/A:1003174629151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Calvin's view, there is no reasonable non-belief. [[Neo-Calvinism|Neo-Calvinists]] who adhere to the [[presuppositional apologetics|presuppositionalist]] school of [[Christian apologetics]] sometimes appeal to a ''sensus divinitatis'' to argue that there are no genuine [[atheism|atheists]]:

{{quote|That there exists in the human mind and indeed by natural instinct, some sense of Deity [''sensus divinitatis''], we hold to be beyond dispute, since God himself, to prevent any man from pretending ignorance, has endued all men with some idea of his Godhead…. …this is not a doctrine which is first learned at school, but one as to which every man is, from the womb, his own master; one which nature herself allows no individual to forget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Institutes of the Christian Religion|last=Calvin|first=Jean|publisher=Westminster/John Knox Press,U.S.|ISBN=0-664-22028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Analytic philosophy|Analytic philosopher]] [[Alvin Plantinga]] of the [[University of Notre Dame]] posits a modified form of the ''sensus divinitatis'' whereby all have the sense, only it does not work properly in some humans, due to sin's [[nous|noetic]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alvin|last=Plantinga|title=Warranted Christian Belief|ISBN=0-19-513192-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Reformed epistemology]])

[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], the 18th-century American Calvinist preacher and theologian, claimed that while every human being has been granted the capacity to know God, successful use of these capacities requires an attitude of "true benevolence".

==Criticism==

Philosopher Steven Maitzen claimed in 2006 that the [[demographics]] of religious belief make the existence of the ''sensus divinitatis'' unlikely, as this sense appears so unevenly distributed.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal| last = Maitzen| first = Steven | title = Divine hiddenness and the demographics of theism| journal = Religious Studies| volume = 42| pages = 177–191| publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2006| url = http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_Hiddenness.pdf| doi = 10.1017/S0034412506008274| accessdate =2012-01-26 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Maitzen may{{according to whom|date=October 2013}} have confused [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]'s ''sensus dei''{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} with ''sensus divinitatis''—''sensus divinitatis'' (a religious sense) only necessitates a core religious/faith component to one's beliefs, whereas the ''sensus dei'' aims at a natural knowledge of God—compare ''In the Twilight of Western Thought'' by [[Herman Dooyeweerd]] (1894–1977).&lt;ref&gt;

This model diverges from earlier [[rationalist]] theories of morality, such as of [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]'s [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stage theory of moral reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Current Formulation of Kohlberg’s Theory and a Response to Critics|url = http://www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000272945|journal = Human Development|pages = 94-100|volume = 28|issue = 2|doi = 10.1159/000272945|first = Charles|last = Levine|first2 = Lawrence|last2 = Kohlberg|first3 = Alexandra|last3 = Hewer}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Haidt]] (2001) de-emphasizes the role of reasoning in reaching moral conclusions. Haidt asserts that moral judgment is primarily given rise to by [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], with reasoning playing a smaller role in most of our moral decision-making. Conscious thought-processes serve as a kind of [[post hoc theorizing|post hoc]] justification of our decisions.

His main evidence comes from studies of "moral dumbfounding"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McHugh|first=Cillian|last2=McGann|first2=Marek|last3=Igou|first3=Eric R.|last4=Kinsella|first4=Elaine L.|date=2017-10-04|title=Searching for Moral Dumbfounding: Identifying Measurable Indicators of Moral Dumbfounding|url=http://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.79|journal=Collabra: Psychology|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1525/collabra.79|issn=2474-7394|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where people have strong moral reactions but fail to establish any kind of rational principle to explain their reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, Jonathan. The righteous mind. Pantheon: 2012. Loc 539, Kindle ed. In footnote 29, Haidt credits the neology of the term ''moral dumbfounding'' to social/experimental psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]].  &lt;/ref&gt; An example situation in which moral intuitions are activated is as follows: Imagine that a brother and sister sleep together once. No one else knows, no harm befalls either one, and both feel it brought them closer as siblings. Most people imagining this [[incest]] scenario have very strong negative reaction, yet cannot explain why.&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, Jonathan. The righteous mind. Pantheon: 2012. Loc 763 Kindle ed.&lt;/ref&gt;  Referring to earlier studies by [[Howard Margolis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Patterns, Thinking, and Cognition: A Theory of Judgment by Howard Margolis. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987, 332 pp. (ISBN 0-226-50527-8)|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00131728909335595|journal = The Educational Forum|date = 1989-06-30|issn = 0013-1725|pages = 199-202|volume = 53|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/00131728909335595|first = Burton L.|last = Grover}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, Haidt suggests that we have [[Unconscious cognition|unconscious]] intuitive [[heuristics]] which generate our reactions to morally charged-situations, and underlie our moral behavior. He suggests that when people explain their moral positions, they often miss, if not hide, the core premises and processes that actually led to those conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, Jonathan. The righteous mind. Pantheon: 2012. Loc 1160 Kindle ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SocialIntuitionistCC.jpg|thumbnail|400px|right]]

Haidt's model also states that moral reasoning is more likely to be interpersonal than private, reflecting social motives (reputation, alliance-building) rather than abstract principles. He does grant that interpersonal discussion (and, on very rare occasions, private reflection) can activate new intuitions which will then be carried forward into future judgments.

==Reasons to doubt the role of cognition==

Haidt (2001) lists four reasons to doubt the cognitive primacy model championed by Kohlberg and others.&lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2001). "The emotional dog and its rational tail: A social intuitionist approach to moral judgment." ''Psychological Review, 108'', 814-834.&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is considerable evidence that many evaluations, including moral judgments, take place automatically, at least in their initial stages (and these initial judgments anchor subsequent judgments).
# The moral reasoning process is highly biased by two sets of motives, which Haidt labels "relatedness" motives (relating to managing impressions and having smooth interactions with others) and "coherence" motives (preserving a coherent identity and worldview).
# The reasoning process has repeatedly been shown to create convincing post hoc justifications for behavior that are believed by people despite not actually correctly describing the reason underlying the choice.  This was demonstrated in a classic paper by Nisbett and Wilson (1977).
# According to Haidt, moral action covaries more with moral emotion than with moral reasoning.

==Objections to Haidt's model==
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
Joseph Paxton and [[Joshua_Greene_(psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] (2010) review evidence suggesting that moral reasoning plays a significant role in moral judgment, including counteracting automatic tendencies toward bias.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, J., &amp; Greene, J. (2010). "Moral reasoning: Hints and allegations." ''Topics in Cognitive Science, 2'', 511-527.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greene and colleagues have proposed an alternative to the social intuitionist model suggesting that [[deontological]] moral judgments, which involve rights and duties, are driven primarily by intuition, while [[utilitarian]] judgments aimed at promoting the greater good are underlain by controlled cognitive reasoning processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4899">'''Stefan Błachowski''' ([[Opawa, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Opawa]], 19 May 1889 – 31 January 1962, [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[psychologist]] and professor at [[Poznań University]].

==Life==
Błachowski was the son of a military physician, Konstanty Błachowski, and Maria Niklas. He graduated from ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' no. V in [[Lwów]] (Lviv) and in 1907 began studying [[philosophy]], psychology and [[philology]] at [[Lwów University]]. In 1909 he transferred briefly to [[Vienna University]], then to [[Göttingen University]] (1909–13: psychology, physics, biology). In 1913 he studied biology again at Vienna and successfully defended his doctoral thesis at Göttingen.

In 1914-1919 Błachowski worked at [[Lwów University]], where he was an assistant lecturer (''starszy asystent'') and from 1917 an [[assistant professor]] (''docent'') of philosophy, and from 1918 librarian of the university library. He spent several years (1914–16) of his employment at Lwów University at [[World War I]] fronts, and in 1918-19 he participated as a volunteer in the defense of [[Lwów]].

In 1919 he transferred to [[Poznań University]], where he was an [[associate professor]] (''profesor nadzwyczajny''), then a [[professor]] (''profesor zwyczajny'', 1921), director of the Chair of Psychology (1919–60), dean of Humanities (1934–37), pro-rector (1938–39 and 1945–46) and rector (1946–48). In 1945-47 he was a member of the National Council (''Rada Narodowa'') at the Ministry of Education (''Ministerstwo Oświaty''). During [[World War II]] he conducted underground teaching in [[Warsaw]].

He did research in [[psychophysiology]], the [[psychology of religion]], and the psychology of [[memory]]. He was the first in Poland to conduct experimental studies of [[religious]] [[psychoses]]. He was likewise a pioneer in Polish studies of memory and [[mathematical]] abilities. He studied the role of [[imagination]], memory, [[erudition]], the [[subconscious]] and [[idea]]s in [[scientific]] [[creativity]]. He initiated Polish research in [[sports psychology]].

In the 1930s Błachowski helped establish a psychology institute at [[Wilno University]]. After [[World War II]], as pro-rector and rector of [[Poznań University]], he rebuilt the university's psychology institute, library and professors' houses, which had been burned by the Germans.

Błachowski maintained contacts with many world authorities in psychology, including [[Jean Piaget]].

==Works==
Błachowski published over a hundred scientific studies, including:

&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of Sufism have been referred to as "Sufis" (Arabic plurals: {{Rtl-lang|ar|صُوفِيَّة}} ''ṣūfiyyah''; {{Rtl-lang|ar|صُوفِيُّون}} ''ṣūfiyyūn''; {{Rtl-lang|ar|مُتَصَوُّفََة}} ''mutaṣawwifah''; {{Rtl-lang|ar|مُتَصَوُّفُون}} ''mutaṣawwifūn'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Historically, Sufis have often belonged to different ''[[tariqa|ṭuruq]]'', or "orders" – congregations formed around a grand master referred to as a ''[[wali]]'' who traces a direct [[silsilah|chain of successive teachers]] back to the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Editors |first= The |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/583591/tariqa |title= tariqa &amp;#124; Islam |publisher= Britannica.com |date= 2014-02-04 |accessdate= 29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These orders meet for spiritual sessions (''[[majalis]]'') in meeting places known as ''[[Zawiya (institution)|zawiyas]]'', ''[[khanqah]]s'' or ''tekke''.{{sfn|Glassé|2008|p= 499}} They strive for ''[[ihsan]]'' (perfection of worship), as detailed in a ''[[hadith]]'': "Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him; if you can't see Him, surely He sees you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Bin Jamil Zeno|first= Muhammad|title= The Pillars of Islam &amp; Iman |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=u-bNf9xCULsC&amp;pg=PA19 |year= 1996|publisher= Darussalam|isbn= 978-9960-897-12-7|pages= 19–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufis regard Muhammad as ''[[al-Insān al-Kāmil]]'', the primary perfect man who exemplifies the morality of God,{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|Walker|2014|p= 446}} and see him as their leader and prime spiritual guide.

All Sufi orders trace most of their original precepts from Muhammad through his cousin and son-in-law [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Ali]], with the notable exception of one.

Although the overwhelming majority of Sufis, both pre-modern and modern, were and are adherents of [[Sunni Islam]], there also developed certain strands of Sufi practice within the ambit of [[Shia Islam]] during the late medieval period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Although Sufis were opposed to dry legalism, they strictly observed Islamic law and belonged to various schools of Islamic jurisprudence and theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Schimmel |first= Annemarie |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sufism |title= Sufism &amp;#124; Islam |publisher= Britannica.com |date= 2014-11-25 |access-date= 2018-06-26|quote=Opposed to the dry casuistry of the lawyer-divines, the mystics nevertheless scrupulously observed the commands of the divine law. [...] It should be noted that the mystics belonged to all schools of Islamic law and theology of the times.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufis have been characterized by their [[asceticism]], especially by their attachment to ''[[dhikr]]'', the practice of remembrance of God, often performed after prayers.&lt;ref&gt;''A Prayer for Spiritual Elevation and Protection'' (2007) by Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi, Suha Taji-Farouki&lt;/ref&gt; They gained adherents among a number of Muslims as a reaction against the worldliness of the early [[Umayyad Caliphate]] (661–750)&lt;ref name="FirstDynasty"&gt;

and have spanned several continents and cultures over a millennium, initially expressing their beliefs in Arabic and later expanding into [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Urdu]], among others.{{sfn|Sells|1996|p= 1}} Sufis played an important role in the formation of Muslim societies through their missionary and educational activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Schimmel |first= Annemarie |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sufism |title= Sufism|publisher= Britannica.com |date= 2014-11-25 |access-date= 2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[William Chittick]], "In a broad sense, Sufism can be described as the interiorization, and intensification of Islamic faith and practice."{{sfn|Chittick|2007|p= 22}}

==Terminology==

The term ''Sufism'' came into being not by Islamic texts or Sufis themselves but by [[Orientalism#British Orientalism|British Orientalists]] who wanted to create an artificial divide between what they found attractive in Islamic civilisation (i.e. Islamic spirituality) and the negative stereotypes that were present in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] about Islam. These British orientalists, therefore, fabricated a divide that was previously non-existent.&lt;ref name="earnst"&gt;Chittick (2008), p.6&lt;/ref&gt; {{Better source|date=November 2018}}

Historically, Muslims have used the originally Arabic word ''taṣawwuf'' ({{lang|ar|تصوف}}) to identify the practice of Sufis.&lt;ref name="qamar"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=t1ORAgAAQBAJ&amp;|title=Striving for Divine Union: Spiritual Exercises for Suhraward Sufis|author=Qamar-ul Huda|pages=1–4|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream scholars of Islam define ''Tasawwuf'' or Sufism as the name for the inner or [[wikt:esoteric|esoteric]] dimension of Islam&lt;ref&gt;Alan Godlas, University of Georgia, [http://www.uga.edu/islam/Sufism.html ''Sufism's Many Paths''], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; which is supported and complemented by outward or [[exoteric]] practices of Islam, such as [[sharia]].{{sfn|Guénon|2001}} In this view, "it is absolutely necessary to be a Muslim" to be a true Sufi, because Sufism's "methods are inoperative without" Muslim "affiliation".{{sfn|Glassé|2008|p=500}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://worldsufimission.org|title= World Sufi Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Islamic scholars themselves are not by any means in agreement about the meaning of the word "sufi".{{sfn|Chittick|2007}}

Sufis themselves claim that ''Tasawwuf'' is an aspect of Islam similar to ''sharia'',&lt;ref name="qamar"/&gt; inseparable from Islam and an integral part of Islamic belief and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Chittick (2008), p.3,4,11&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Sufi scholars have defined ''Tasawwuf'' as "a science whose objective is the reparation of the heart and turning it away from all else but God".&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Zarruq, Zaineb Istrabadi, Hamza Yusuf Hanson. ''The Principles of Sufism''. Amal Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Sufis such as [[Bayazid Bastami]], [[Rumi]], [[Haji Bektash Veli]], [[Junayd of Baghdad]], [[Al-Ghazali]], and [[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani|Sayyid Ali Hamadani]], define Sufism as purely based upon the tenets of Islam and the teachings of Muhammad.{{sfn|Chittick|2007}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/corrections_popular.html |title= Corrections of Popular Versions of Poems From Rumi's Divan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/self-discovery.html |title=Rumi and Self-Discovery |author=Ibrahim Gamard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasr"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IgVtq3kNCrYC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=origins+of+tasawwuf#v=onepage&amp;q=origins%20of%20tasawwuf&amp;f=false |title=An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines |publisher= |accessdate=17 January 2015 |isbn=9780791415153 |author1=Nasr |first1=Seyyed Hossein Nasr |date=1993-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The original meaning of ''sufi'' seems to have been "one who wears wool (''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣūf}}'')", and the  [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] calls other etymological hypotheses "untenable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=William C. Chittick|title=Sufism. Sūfī Thought and Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|authors=Massington, L., Radtke, B., Chittick, W.C., Jong, F. de., Lewisohn, L., Zarcone, Th., Ernst, C, Aubin, Françoise and J.O. Hunwick|title=Taṣawwuf|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_islam_COM_1188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woollen clothes were traditionally associated with ascetics and mystics.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; [[Al-Qushayri]] and [[Ibn Khaldun]] both rejected all possibilities other than ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣūf}}'' on linguistic grounds.&lt;ref name=exeg&gt;Rashid Ahmad Jullundhry, ''Qur'anic Exegesis in Classical Literature'', pg. 56. [[New Westminster]]: [[The Other Press]], 2010. {{ISBN|9789675062551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation traces the lexical root of the word to ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣafā}}'' ''({{lang|ar|صفاء}})'', which in Arabic means "purity". These two explanations were combined by the Sufi al-Rudhabari (d. 322 AH), who said, "The Sufi is the one who wears wool on top of purity".&lt;ref&gt;''The Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition Guidebook of Daily Practices and Devotions'', p. 83, Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mac.abc.se/home/onesr/f/Sufism%20in%20Islam.htm |title=Sufism in Islam |publisher=Mac.abc.se |accessdate=13 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417203708/http://mac.abc.se/home/onesr/f/Sufism%20in%20Islam.htm |archivedate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested that the word comes from the term ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ahl aṣ-ṣuffah}}'' ("the people of the bench"), who were a group of impoverished companions of Muhammad who held regular gatherings of ''dhikr''. These men and women who sat at [[al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] are considered by some to be the first Sufis.&lt;ref&gt;The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies by Clinton Bennett, p 328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sufiway.net/1sec4=ORigSUF811326.html |title=Origin of sufism – Qadiri |publisher=Sufi Way |year=2003 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Sufism could also be a neologism of German origin coined by [[August Tholuck]] in his first book ''Sufismus, sive theosophia Persarum pantheistica'', published in Latin in Berlin in 1821.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==History==
{{main|History of Sufism}}

===Origins===
[[File:Rashidun Caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib - علي بن أبي طالب.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|Ali is considered to be the "Father of Sufism" in Islam.&lt;ref name="alim.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alim.org/library/biography/khalifa/content/KAL/79/1|title=Khalifa Ali bin Abu Talib - Ali, The Father of Sufism - Alim.org|publisher=|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to [[Carl W. Ernst]] the earliest figures of Sufism are Muhammad himself and his companions (''[[Sahabah]]'').&lt;ref name="carl1"&gt;{{citation|title=Tasawwuf [Sufism]|publisher=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World|year=2003|author=Carl W. Ernst}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufi orders are based on the ''"bay‘ah"'' (&lt;big&gt;بَيْعَة&lt;/big&gt; ''bay‘ah'', &lt;big&gt;مُبَايَعَة&lt;/big&gt; ''mubāya‘ah'' "pledge, allegiance") that was given to Muhammad by his ''Ṣahabah''. By pledging allegiance to Muhammad, the Sahabah had committed themselves to the service of God. According to Islamic belief, by pledging allegiance to Muhammad, the ''Sahabah'' pledged allegiance to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://naqshbandi.org/teachings/topics/taking-initiation-bayah/|title=Taking Initiation (Bay`ah)|publisher=Naqshbandi Sufi Way}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=4VswAAAAYAAJ&amp;|title=Classical Islam and the Naqshbandi Sufi tradition|page=644|publisher=Islamic Supreme Council of America|author=Muhammad Hisham Kabbani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carl1"/&gt;

{{quote|Verily, those who give Bai'âh (pledge) to you (O Muhammad) they are giving Bai'âh (pledge) to Allâh. The Hand of Allâh is over their hands. Then whosoever breaks his pledge, breaks it only to his own harm, and whosoever fulfils what he has covenanted with Allâh, He will bestow on him a great reward. — [Translation of Quran, 48:10]}}

Sufis believe that by giving ''bayʿah'' (pledging allegiance) to a legitimate Sufi [[shaykh]], one is pledging allegiance to Muhammad; therefore, a spiritual connection between the seeker and Muhammad is established. It is through Muhammad that Sufis aim to learn about, understand and connect with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naqshbandi.org/teachings/topics/taking-initiation-bayah/|title=Taking Initiation (Bay`ah) {{!}} The Naqshbandiyya Nazimiyya Sufi Order of America: Sufism and Spirituality|website=naqshbandi.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali is regarded as one of the major figures amongst the ''Sahaba'' who have directly pledged allegiance to Muhammad, and Sufis maintain that through Ali, knowledge about Muhammad and a connection with Muhammad may be attained. Such a concept may be understood by the ''hadith'', which Sufis regard to be authentic, in which Muhammad said, "I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=O8HbK6QUhl8C&amp;pg=PA461|title=Journal of a Sufi Odyssey|author=Shaykh Tariq Knecht|publisher=Tauba Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eminent Sufis such as [[Ali Hujwiri]] refer to Ali as having a very high ranking in ''Tasawwuf''. Furthermore, Junayd of Baghdad regarded Ali as [[sheikh]] of the principals and practices of ''Tasawwuf''.&lt;ref name="alim.org"/&gt;

Historian Jonathan A.C. Brown notes that during the lifetime of Muhammad, some companions were more inclined than others to "intensive devotion, pious abstemiousness and pondering the divine mysteries" more than Islam required, such as [[Abu Dhar al-Ghifari]]. [[Hasan al-Basri]], a [[Tabi‘un|tabi]], is considered a "founding figure" in the "science of purifying the heart".&lt;ref name=brown-58&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Brown|first1 = Jonathan A.C.|authorlink=Jonathan A.C.

Practitioners of Sufism hold that in its early stages of development Sufism effectively referred to nothing more than the internalization of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/english/Contemporary/2002/08/article03.shtml IslamOnline.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724160152/http://www.islamonline.net/english/Contemporary/2002/08/article03.shtml |date=July 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one perspective, it is directly from the Qur'an, constantly recited, meditated, and experienced, that Sufism proceeded, in its origin and its development.&lt;ref&gt;Massignon, Louis. ''Essai sur les origines du lexique technique de la mystique musulmane''. Paris: Vrin, 1954. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Other practitioners have held that Sufism is the strict emulation of the way of Muhammad, through which the heart's connection to the Divine is strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imam Birgivi]], ''The Path of Muhammad'', WorldWisdom, {{ISBN|0-941532-68-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern academics and scholars have rejected early Orientalist theories asserting a non-Islamic origin of Sufism,&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sufism] Encyclopædia Britannica, Retrieved on August 1st, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus is that it emerged in [[Western Asia]]. Many have asserted Sufism to be unique within the confines of the Islamic religion, and contend that Sufism developed from people like Bayazid Bastami, who, in his utmost reverence to the [[sunnah]], refused to eat a watermelon because he did not find any proof that Muhammad ever ate it.{{sfn|Chittick|2007}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Nasr|first=Hossein|authorlink=Hossein Nasr|title=An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IgVtq3kNCrYC&amp;pg=PA192|year=1993|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1515-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the late medieval mystic [[Jami]], [[Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]] (died c. 716) was the first person to be called a "Sufi".&lt;ref name=exeg/&gt;

Important contributions in writing are attributed to [[Uwais al-Qarani]], [[Hasan of Basra]], [[Harith al-Muhasibi]], [[Abu Nasr as-Sarraj]] and [[Said ibn al-Musayyib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sufism The Formative Period|last=Karamustafa|first=Ahmet|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=0520252691|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruwaym]], from the second generation of Sufis in Baghdad, was also an influential early figure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ridgeon|first=Lloyd|title=Morals and Mysticism in Persian Sufism: A History of Sufi-Futuwwat in Iran|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBnHBQAAQBAJ|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-97058-0}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khallikan]]'s Biographical Dictionary, translated by [[William McGuckin de Slane]].

Karamustafa, ''Sufism: The Formative Period'', pg. 58. [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]: [[University of California Press]], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sufism had a long history already before the subsequent institutionalization of Sufi teachings into devotional orders (''tarîqât'') in the early Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;J. Spencer Trimingham, ''The Sufi Orders in Islam'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-512058-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Naqshbandi order is a notable exception to general rule of orders tracing their spiritual lineage through Muhammad's grandsons, as it traces the origin of its teachings from Muhammad to the first [[Islamic Caliph]], Abu Bakr.&lt;ref name="SupremeCouncil"&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Islam and the Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition|last=Kabbani|first=Muhammad Hisham|publisher=Islamic Supreme Council of America|year=2004|isbn=1-930409-23-0|page=557|authorlink=Hisham Kabbani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Sufi orders have influenced and been adopted by various Shi'i movements, especially [[Isma'ilism]], which led to the [[Safaviyya]] order's conversion to Shia Islam from Sunni Islam and the spread of [[Twelver]]ism throughout Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Daftary |Farhad |2013 |A History of Shi'i Islam |New York NY |I.B.

===As an Islamic discipline===

[[File:Dance_of_Sufi_Dervishes.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|Dancing dervishes, by [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād]] (c. 1480/1490)]]

Existing in both Sunni and Shia Islam, Sufism is not a distinct sect, as is sometimes erroneously assumed, but a method of approaching or a way of understanding the religion, which strives to take the regular practice of the religion to the "supererogatory level" through simultaneously "fulfilling ... [the obligatory] religious duties"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and finding a "way and a means of striking a root through the 'narrow gate' in the depth of the [[rūḥ|soul]] out into the domain of the pure arid unimprisonable [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Spirit]] which itself opens out on to the Divinity."&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Jonathan AC Brown - What is Sufism?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFatRwdPm0|publisher=youtube.com|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin Lings 1983, p.15"/&gt; Academic studies of Sufism confirm that Sufism, as a separate tradition from Islam apart from so-called ''pure Islam'', is frequently a product of [[Orientalism|Western orientalism]] and modern [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Pittman ''Classical Spirituality in Contemporary America: The Confluence and Contribution of G.I. Gurdjieff and Sufism'' Bloomsbury Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-441-13113-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mystic and ascetic aspect of Islam, it is considered as the part of Islamic teaching that deals with the purification of the inner self. By focusing on the more spiritual aspects of religion, Sufis strive to obtain direct experience of God by making use of "intuitive and emotional faculties" that one must be trained to use.&lt;ref&gt;Trimingham (1998), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tasawwuf'' is regarded as a science of the soul that has always been an integral part of Orthodox Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/misc/faridi.htm|title=The Meaning of Tasawwuf|last=Faridi|first=Shaikh Shahidullah|website=www.masud.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Al-Risala al-Safadiyya'', [[ibn Taymiyyah]] describes the Sufis as those who belong to the path of the Sunna and represent it in their teachings and writings.

Ibn Taymiyya's Sufi inclinations and his reverence for Sufis like [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] can also be seen in his hundred-page commentary on ''Futuh al-ghayb'', covering only five of the seventy-eight sermons of the book, but showing that he considered ''tasawwuf'' essential within the life of the Islamic community.

In his commentary, Ibn Taymiyya stresses that the primacy of the ''sharia'' forms the soundest tradition in ''tasawwuf'', and to argue this point he lists over a dozen early masters, as well as more contemporary [[shaykhs]] like his fellow [[Hanbali]]s, al-Ansari al-Harawi and Abdul-Qadir, and the latter's own shaykh, Hammad al-Dabbas the upright. He cites the early shaykhs (shuyukh al-salaf) such as [[Al-Fuḍayl ibn ‘Iyāḍ]], [[Ibrahim ibn Adham]], [[Maruf Karkhi|Ma`ruf al-Karkhi]], [[Sirri Saqti]], Junayd of Baghdad, and others of the early teachers, as well as [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], Hammad, Abu al-Bayan and others of the later masters— that they do not permit the followers of the Sufi path to depart from the divinely legislated command and prohibition.

Al-Ghazali narrates in ''Al-Munqidh min al-dalal'':
{{quote|The vicissitudes of life, family affairs and financial constraints engulfed my life and deprived me of the congenial solitude. The heavy odds confronted me and provided me with few moments for my pursuits. This state of affairs lasted for ten years, but whenever I had some spare and congenial moments I resorted to my intrinsic proclivity. During these turbulent years, numerous astonishing and indescribable secrets of life were unveiled to me. I was convinced that the group of Aulia (holy mystics) is the only truthful group who follow the right path, display best conduct and surpass all sages in their wisdom and insight. They derive all their overt or covert behaviour from the illumining guidance of the holy Prophet, the only guidance worth quest and pursuit.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}}}

===Formalization of doctrine===

In the eleventh-century, Sufism, which had previously been a less "codified" trend in Islamic piety, began to be "ordered and crystallized" into [[tariqa|orders]] which have continued until the present day. All these orders were founded by a major Islamic scholar, and some of the largest and most widespread included the [[Qadiriyya]] (after [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] [d. 1166]), the [[Rifa'i]]yya (after [[Ahmed al-Rifa'i]] [d. 1182]), the [[Chishti Order|Chishtiyya]] (after [[Moinuddin Chishti]] [d. 1236]), the [[Shadiliyya]] (after [[Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili]] [d. 1258]), the Hamadaniyyah (after [[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani|Sayyid Ali Hamadani]] [d. 1384], the Naqshbandiyya (after [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]] [d. 1389]).&lt;ref name="Seyyed Hossein Nasr 2007 p. 76"&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''The Essential Seyyed Hossein Nasr'', ed. William C. Chittick (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2007), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular perception in the West,&lt;ref name="Martin Lings 1983, p.16"&gt;Martin Lings, ''What is Sufism?'' (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2005; first imp. 1983, second imp. 1999), p.16&lt;/ref&gt; however, neither the founders of these orders nor their followers ever considered themselves to be anything other than orthodox Sunni Muslims,&lt;ref name="Martin Lings 1983, p.16"/&gt; and in fact all of these orders were attached to one of the [[maddhab|four orthodox legal schools]] of Sunni Islam.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt;&lt;ref name="themuslim500.com"/&gt; Thus, the [[Qadiriyya]] order was [[Hanbali]], with its founder, [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], being a renowned  jurist; the [[Chishti Order|Chishtiyya]] was [[Hanafi]]; the [[Shadiliyya]] order was [[Maliki]]; and the Naqshbandiyya order was [[Hanafi]].&lt;ref&gt;Massington, L., Radtke, B., Chittick, W.C., Jong, F. de., Lewisohn, L., Zarcone, Th., Ernst, C, Aubin, Françoise and J.O.

"Hanafi," "Hanbali," and "Maliki," and under "mysticism in..." for each.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is precisely because it is historically proven that "many of the most eminent defenders of Islamic orthodoxy, such as [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], [[Ghazali]], and the Sultan Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn ([[Saladin]]) were connected with Sufism"&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2008, p. 4"&gt;Titus Burckhardt, ''Introduction to Sufi Doctrine'' (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2008, p. 4, note 2&lt;/ref&gt; that the popular studies of writers like [[Idries Shah]] are continuously disregarded by scholars as conveying the fallacious image that "Sufism" is somehow distinct from "Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''What is Sufism?''

Towards the end of the first millennium, a number of manuals began to be written summarizing the doctrines of Sufism and describing some typical Sufi practices. Two of the most famous of these are now available in English translation: the ''[[Kashf ul Mahjoob|Kashf al-Mahjûb]]'' of [[Ali Hujwiri]] and the ''Risâla'' of Al-Qushayri.&lt;ref&gt;The most recent version of the ''Risâla'' is the translation of Alexander Knysh, ''Al-Qushayri's Epistle on Sufism: Al-risala Al-qushayriyya Fi 'ilm Al-tasawwuf'' ({{ISBN|978-1859641866}}). Earlier translations include a partial version by Rabia Terri Harris (''Sufi Book of Spiritual Ascent'') and complete versions by Harris, and Barbara R. Von Schlegell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of al-Ghazali's greatest treatises are the ''Revival of Religious Sciences'' and what he termed "its essence", the ''[[Kimiya-yi sa'ādat]]''. He argued that Sufism originated from the Qur'an and thus was compatible with mainstream Islamic thought and did not in any way contradict Islamic Law—being instead necessary to its complete fulfillment. Ongoing efforts by both traditionally trained Muslim scholars and Western academics are making al-Ghazali's works more widely available in English translation, allowing English-speaking readers to judge for themselves the compatibility of Islamic Law and Sufi doctrine. Several sections of the ''Revival of Religious Sciences'' have been published in translation by the Islamic Texts Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fonsvitae.com/sufism.html|title=Home|publisher=Fons Vitae|date=|accessdate=29 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924014336/http://www.fonsvitae.com/sufism.html|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abridged translation (from an Urdu translation) of ''The Alchemy of Happiness'' was published by Claud Field ({{ISBN|978-0935782288}}) in 1910.

===Growth of influence===
[[File:Jahangir with sufi.jpg|thumb|upright=1| A [[Mughal miniature]] dated from the early 1620s depicting the [[Mughal emperor]] [[Jahangir]] (d. 1627) preferring an audience with Sufi [[saint]] to his contemporaries, the [[Ottoman Sultan]] and the [[King of England]] [[James I]] (d. 1625); the picture is inscribed in [[Persian language|Persian]]: "Though outwardly shahs stand before him, he fixes his gazes on dervishes."]]
Historically, Sufism became "an incredibly important part of Islam" and "one of the most widespread and omnipresent aspects of Muslim life" in [[Islamic Civilization during the European Renaissance|Islamic civilization]] from the early medieval period onwards,&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is orthodox Islam possible without Sufism? - Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad (Dr. Timothy Winter)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQWNeGyRu0k|publisher=youtube.com|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Jonathan AC Brown - What is Sufism?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFatRwdPm0|publisher=youtube.com|date=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it began to permeate nearly all major aspects of Sunni Islamic life in regions stretching from [[India]] and [[Iraq]] to the [[Balkans]] and [[Senegal]].&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

The rise of Islamic civilization coincides strongly with the spread of Sufi philosophy in Islam. The spread of Sufism has been considered a definitive factor in the spread of Islam, and in the creation of integrally Islamic cultures, especially in Africa&lt;ref&gt;For the pre-modern era, see Vincent J. Cornell, ''Realm of the Saint: Power and Authority in Moroccan Sufism'', {{ISBN|978-0-292-71209-6}}; and for the colonial era, Knut Vikyr, ''Sufi and Scholar on the Desert Edge: Muhammad B. Oali Al-Sanusi and His Brotherhood'', {{ISBN|978-0-8101-1226-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Asia. The [[Senussi]] tribes of [[Libya]] and the [[Sudan]] are one of the strongest adherents of Sufism. Sufi poets and philosophers such as [[Khoja Akhmet Yassawi]], Rumi, and [[Attar of Nishapur]] (c. 1145 – c. 1221) greatly enhanced the spread of Islamic culture in [[Anatolia]], [[Central Asia]], and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Lewisohn, ''The Legacy of Medieval Persian Sufism'', Khaniqahi-Nimatullahi Publications, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''Islam: Religion, History, and Civilization'', HarperSanFrancisco, 2003. (Ch. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Sufism also played a role in creating and propagating the culture of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] world,&lt;ref&gt;Dina Le Gall, ''A Culture of Sufism: Naqshbandis in the Ottoman World, 1450–1700'', {{ISBN|978-0-7914-6245-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in resisting European imperialism in North Africa and South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur F. Buehler, ''Sufi Heirs of the Prophet: The Indian Naqshbandiyya and the Rise of the Mediating Sufi Shaykh'', {{ISBN|978-1-57003-783-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 13th and 16th centuries, Sufism produced a flourishing intellectual culture throughout the Islamic world, a "Golden Age" whose physical artifacts survive.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In many places a person or group would endow a [[waqf]] to maintain a lodge (known variously as a ''zawiya'', ''khanqah'', or ''tekke'') to provide a gathering place for Sufi adepts, as well as lodging for itinerant seekers of knowledge. The same system of endowments could also pay for a complex of buildings, such as that surrounding the [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] in Istanbul, including a lodge for Sufi seekers, a [[hospice]] with kitchens where these seekers could serve the poor and/or complete a period of initiation, a library, and other structures. No important domain in the civilization of Islam remained unaffected by Sufism in this period.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Danner, ''The Islamic Tradition: An introduction''. Amity House. February 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Current Sufi orders include [[Alians]], [[Bektashi Order]], [[Mevlevi Order]], [[Ba 'Alawiyya]], [[Chishti Order]], [[Jerrahi]], Naqshbandi, [[Mujaddidi]], [[Ni'matullāhī]], [[Qadiriyya]], [[Qalandariyya]], [[Qadiriyya#Sarwari Qadiri|Sarwari Qadiriyya]], [[Shadhili]]yya, [[Suhrawardiyya]], Saifiah (Naqshbandiah), and [[Uwaisi]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The relationship of Sufi orders to modern societies is usually defined by their relationship to governments.&lt;ref&gt;Masatoshi Kisaichi, "The Burhami order and Islamic resurgence in modern Egypt." ''Popular Movements and Democratization in the Islamic World'', pg. 57. Part of the New Horizons in Islamic Studies series. Ed. Masatoshi Kisaichi. London: Routledge, 2006. {{ISBN|9781134150618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey and Persia together have been a center for many Sufi lineages and orders. The Bektashi were closely affiliated with the Ottoman [[Janissaries]] and are the heart of Turkey's large and mostly liberal [[Alevism|Alevi]] population. They have spread westwards to [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]], [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kosovo]], and, more recently, to the United States, via [[Albania]].

Sufism is popular in such African countries as [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Senegal]], where it is seen as a mystical expression of Islam.{{sfn|Babou|2007|p=184–6}} Sufism is traditional in Morocco, but has seen a growing revival with the renewal of Sufism under contemporary spiritual teachers such as [[Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi]]. Mbacke suggests that one reason Sufism has taken hold in Senegal is because it can accommodate local beliefs and customs, which tend toward the [[mysticism|mystical]].{{sfn|Mbacké|Hunwick|2005}}

The life of the Algerian Sufi master [[Abdelkader El Djezairi]] is instructive in this regard.{{sfn|Chodkiewicz|1995|p=introduction}} Notable as well are the lives of [[Amadou Bamba]] and [[El Hadj Umar Tall]] in [[West Africa]], and [[Sheikh Mansur]] and [[Imam Shamil]] in the [[Caucasus]]. In the twentieth century, some Muslims have called Sufism a superstitious religion which holds back Islamic achievement in the fields of science and technology.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2260?_hi=6&amp;_pos=2 |title=Sufism – Oxford Islamic Studies Online |publisher=oxfordislamicstudies.com|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Westerners have embarked with varying degrees of success on the path of Sufism. One of the first to return to Europe as an official representative of a Sufi order, and with the specific purpose to spread Sufism in Western Europe, was the [[Sweden|Swedish]]-born wandering Sufi [[Ivan Aguéli]]. [[René Guénon]], the French scholar, became a Sufi in the early twentieth century and was known as Sheikh Abdul Wahid Yahya. His manifold writings defined the practice of Sufism as the essence of Islam, but also pointed to the universality of its message. Other spiritualists, such as [[George Gurdjieff]], may or may not conform to the tenets of Sufism as understood by orthodox Muslims.

Other noteworthy Sufi teachers who have been active in the West in recent years include [[Bawa Muhaiyaddeen]], [[Inayat Khan]], [[Nazim Al-Haqqani]], [[Javad Nurbakhsh]], [[Bulent Rauf]], [[Irina Tweedie]], [[Idries Shah]], [[Muzaffer Ozak]], [[Nahid Angha]], and [[Ali Kianfar]].

Currently active Sufi academics and publishers include [[Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee]], [[Nuh Ha Mim Keller]], [[Nooruddeen Durkee|Abdullah Nooruddeen Durkee]], [[Waheed Ashraf]], [[Omer Tarin]], Ahmed abdu r Rashid and [[Timothy Winter]].

==Aims and objectives==
[[File:Tome of Shah Rukn-e-Alam.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam]] located in [[Multan]], [[Pakistan]]. Known for its multitude of Sufi shrines, Multan is nicknamed the ’’City of Saints’’.]]

While all Muslims believe that they are on the pathway to Allah and hope to become close to God in [[Paradise]]—after death and after the [[Last Judgment]]—Sufis also believe that it is possible to draw closer to God and to more fully embrace the [[divine presence]] in this life.&lt;ref name="uga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uga.edu/islam/sufismintro.html |title=Sufism, Sufis, and Sufi Orders: Sufism's Many Paths|publisher=uga.edu|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief aim of all Sufis is to seek the pleasing of God by working to restore within themselves the primordial state of ''[[fitra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili|authorlink=Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili|title=The School of the Shadhdhuliyyah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=res8GwAACAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Islamic Texts Society|isbn=978-0-946621-57-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Sufis, the outer law consists of rules pertaining to worship, transactions, marriage, judicial rulings, and criminal law—what is often referred to, broadly, as "[[qanun (law)|qanun]]". The inner law of Sufism consists of rules about repentance from sin, the purging of contemptible qualities and evil traits of character, and adornment with virtues and good character.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Emin Er, ''Laws of the Heart: A Practical Introduction to the Sufi Path'', Shifâ Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teachings===
[[File:Porte mosquee Sidi Boumediene Tlemcen.jpg|thumb|Entrance of [[Sidi Boumediene Mosque]] in [[Tlemcen]], [[Algeria]], built to honor the 12th-century Sufi master [[Abu Madyan]]]]

To the Sufi, it is the transmission of divine light from the teacher's heart to the heart of the student, rather than worldly knowledge, that allows the adept to progress. They further believe that the teacher should attempt inerrantly to follow the Divine Law.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Nur ad-Din Durkee, ''The School of the Shadhdhuliyyah, Volume One: Orisons''; see also Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, ''Classical Islam and the Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition'', {{ISBN|978-1-930409-23-1}}, which reproduces the spiritual lineage (''silsila'') of a living Sufi master.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Moojan Momen]] "one of the most important doctrines of Sufism is the concept of ''al-Insan al-Kamil'' "the Perfect Man". This doctrine states that there will always exist upon the earth a "[[Qutb]]" (Pole or Axis of the Universe)—a man who is the perfect channel of grace from God to man and in a state of [[wilayah]] (sanctity, being under the protection of Allah). The concept of the Sufi Qutb is similar to that of the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Shi'i Imam]].&lt;ref name=qutb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Mohammad Najib-ur-Rehman Madzillah-ul-Aqdus|title=Sultan Bahoo: The Life and Teachings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA277|year=2015|publisher=Sultan ul Faqr Publications|isbn=978-969-9795-18-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this belief puts Sufism in "direct conflict" with Shia Islam, since both the Qutb (who for most Sufi orders is the head of the order) and the Imam fulfill the role of "the purveyor of spiritual guidance and of Allah's grace to mankind". The vow of obedience to the Shaykh or Qutb which is taken by Sufis is considered incompatible with devotion to the Imam".&lt;ref name="qutb"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Momen|first=Moojan|authorlink=Moojan Momen|title=An Introduction to Shiʻi Islam: The History and Doctrines of Twelver Shiʻism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B0OL5Z8S-V0C&amp;pg=PA209|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-03531-5}}, page 209&lt;/ref&gt;

As a further example, the prospective adherent of the Mevlevi Order would have been ordered to serve in the kitchens of a hospice for the poor for 1001 days prior to being accepted for spiritual instruction, and a further 1,001 days in solitary retreat as a precondition of completing that instruction.&lt;ref&gt;See Muhammad Emin Er, ''Laws of the Heart: A Practical Introduction to the Sufi Path'', Shifâ Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-1-6}}, for a detailed description of the practices and preconditions of this sort of spiritual retreat.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A view of darbar sharif.JPG|thumb|left|The Darbar Sharif of [[Shams Ali Qalandar]], located in [[Hujra Shah Muqeem]], Pakistan]]

Some teachers, especially when addressing more general audiences, or mixed groups of Muslims and non-Muslims, make extensive use of [[parable]], [[allegory]], and [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;See examples provided by Muzaffar Ozak in ''Irshad: Wisdom of a Sufi Master'', addressed to a general audience rather than specifically to his own students.&lt;/ref&gt; Although approaches to teaching vary among different Sufi orders, Sufism as a whole is primarily concerned with direct personal experience, and as such has sometimes been compared to other, non-Islamic forms of [[mysticism]] (e.g., as in the books of [[Hossein Nasr]]).

Many Sufi believe that to reach the highest levels of success in Sufism typically requires that the disciple live with and serve the teacher for a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/742957142|title=Islamic cultures and societies to the end of the eighteenth century|last=Knysh|first=Alexander|publisher=|others=Irwin, Robert, 1946-|year=|isbn=9781139056144|location=Cambridge|pages=|chapter=Sufism|oclc=742957142}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the folk story about [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]], who gave his name to the Naqshbandi Order. He is believed to have served his first teacher, Sayyid Muhammad Baba As-Samasi, for 20 years, until as-Samasi died. He is said to then have served several other teachers for lengthy periods of time. He is said to have helped the poorer members of the community for many years and after this concluded his teacher directed him to care for animals cleaning their wounds, and assisting them.&lt;ref&gt;Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, ''Classical Islam and the Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition'', {{ISBN|978-1-930409-23-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotion to Muhammad is an exceptionally strong practice within Sufism.&lt;ref name="carl"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=o58K2t344YQC|title=The Cambridge Companion to Muhammad|page=130|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=Carl W. Ernst|others=Muḥammad as the Pole of Existence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufis have historically revered Muhammad as the prime personality of spiritual greatness. The Sufi poet [[Saadi Shirazi]] stated, "He who chooses a path contrary to that of the prophet, shall never reach the destination. O Saadi, do not think that one can treat that way of purity except in the wake of the chosen one."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Gholamreza Aavani|title=Glorification of the Prophet Muhammad in the Poems of Sa'adi|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumi attributes his self-control and abstinence from worldly desires as qualities attained by him through the guidance of Muhammad. Rumi states, "I 'sewed' my two eyes shut from [desires for] this world and the next – this I learned from Muhammad."{{sfn|Gamard|2004|p=169}} [[Ibn Arabi]] regards Muhammad as the greatest man and states, "Muhammad's wisdom is uniqueness (''fardiya'') because he is the most perfect existent creature of this human species. For this reason, the command began with him and was sealed with him. He was a Prophet while Adam was between water and clay, and his elemental structure is the Seal of the Prophets."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Seals of Wisdom (Fusus al-Hikam)|author=Ibn Arabi|url=https://bewley.virtualave.net/fusus27.html|others=Aisha Bewley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attar of Nishapur]] claimed that he praised Muhammad in such a manner that was not done before by any poet, in his book the ''Ilahi-nama''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Fariduddin Attar|title=Ilahi-nama – The Book of God|others=John Andrew Boyle (translator)|quote=''Thou knowest that none of the poets have sung such praise save only I.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fariduddin Attar stated, "Muhammad is the exemplar to both worlds, the guide of the descendants of Adam. He is the sun of creation, the moon of the celestial spheres, the all-seeing eye...The seven heavens and the eight gardens of paradise were created for him, he is both the eye and the light in the light of our eyes."&lt;ref name="attar"&gt;{{citation|author=Fariduddin Attar|title=Ilahi-nama – The Book of God|others=John Andrew Boyle (translator)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufis have historically stressed the importance of Muhammad's perfection and his ability to intercede. The persona of Muhammad has historically been and remains an integral and critical aspect of Sufi belief and practice.&lt;ref name="carl"/&gt; Bayazid Bastami is recorded to have been so devoted to the ''[[sunnah]]'' of Muhammad that he refused to eat a watermelon because he could not establish that Muhammad ever ate one.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tasawwuf.co/writings/love_allah/love_chapter9.pdf|title=The Signs of a Sincere Lover|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calligraphic_representation_of_Muhammad's_name.jpg|right|thumb|The name of Muhammad in [[Arabic calligraphy]]. Sufis believe the name of Muhammad is holy and sacred.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}]]
In the 13th century, a Sufi poet from [[Egypt]], [[Al-Busiri]], wrote the ''al-Kawākib ad-Durrīya fī Madḥ Khayr al-Barīya'' (The Celestial Lights in Praise of the Best of Creation) commonly referred to as ''[[Al-Burda|Qaṣīdat al-Burda]]'' ("Poem of the Mantle"), in which he extensively praised Muhammad.&lt;ref name="celestial"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=F-nY3_DXo-gC|author=Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych|title=The Mantle Odes: Arabic Praise Poems to the Prophet Muhammad|publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This poem is still widely recited and sung amongst Sufi groups all over the world.&lt;ref name="celestial"/&gt;

====Sufi beliefs about Muhammad====

According to Ibn Arabi, Islam is the best religion because of Muhammad.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|Walker|2014|p=446}} Ibn Arabi regards that the first entity that was brought into existence is the reality or essence of Muhammad (''al-ḥaqīqa al-Muhammadiyya''). Ibn Arabi regards Muhammad as the supreme human being and master of all creatures. Muhammad is therefore the primary [[role model]] for human beings to aspire to emulate.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|Walker|2014|p=446}} Ibn Arabi believes that God's attributes and names are manifested in this world and that the most complete and perfect display of these divine attributes and names are seen in Muhammad.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|Walker|2014|p=446}} Ibn Arabi believes that one may see God in the mirror of Muhammad, meaning that the divine attributes of God are manifested through Muhammad.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|Walker|2014|p=446}} Ibn Arabi maintains that Muhammad is the best proof of God and by knowing Muhammad one knows God.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|Walker|2014|p=446}} Ibn Arabi also maintains that Muhammad is the master of all of humanity in both this world and the afterlife. In this view, Islam is the best religion, because Muhammad is Islam.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|Walker|2014|p=446}}

Sufis maintain that Muhammad is ''Al-Insān al-Kāmil''. Sufis believe that aid and support may be received from Muhammad, even today. Sufis believe that Muhammad listens to them when they call upon him. Sufis strive towards having a relationship with Muhammad and seeking to see Muhammad in a dream is a common Sufi practice.

===Sufism and Islamic law===
[[File:Fatehpur Sikri near Agra 2016-03 img03.jpg|thumb|left|Tomb of [[Salim Chishti]], [[Fatehpur Sikri]], [[Agra]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]]]

Sufis believe the ''sharia'' (exoteric "canon"), ''[[tariqa]]'' ("order") and ''[[haqiqa]]'' ("truth") are mutually interdependent.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Emin Er, ''The Soul of Islam: Essential Doctrines and Beliefs'', Shifâ Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-0-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufism leads the adept, called ''[[salik]]'' or "wayfarer", in his ''sulûk'' or "road" through different stations (''[[maqaam]]'') until he reaches his goal, the perfect ''[[tawhid]]'', the existential confession that God is One.{{sfn|Schimmel|2013|p=99}} Ibn Arabi says, "When we see someone in this Community who claims to be able to guide others to God, but is remiss in but one rule of the Sacred Law—even if he manifests miracles that stagger the mind—asserting that his shortcoming is a special dispensation for him, we do not even turn to look at him, for such a person is not a sheikh, nor is he speaking the truth, for no one is entrusted with the secrets of God Most High save one in whom the ordinances of the Sacred Law are preserved. (''Jamiʿ karamat al-awliyaʾ'')".&lt;ref&gt;(source: [pp. 778–795 of ''The Reliance of the Traveller'', by Shaykh Nuh Ha Meem Keller])&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amman Message]], a detailed statement issued by 200 leading Islamic scholars in 2005 in [[Amman]], specifically recognized the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. This was adopted by the Islamic world's political and temporal leaderships at the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] summit at Mecca in December 2005, and by six other international Islamic scholarly assemblies including the International Islamic Fiqh Academy of Jeddah, in July 2006. The definition of Sufism can vary drastically between different traditions (what may be intended is simple [[tazkiah]] as opposed to the various manifestations of Sufism around the Islamic world).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ammanmessage.com/ The Amman Message Summary]. Retrieved on Feb 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional Islamic thought and Sufism===
[[File:Tomb of said-ul-Auliya sayyid Ali hamadani.jpg|thumb|left|Tomb of Sayyid Ali Hamadani, [[Kulob]], [[Tajikistan]] ]]
The literature of Sufism emphasizes highly subjective matters that resist outside observation, such as the subtle states of the heart. Often these resist direct reference or description, with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance, much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication, which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. Also, some groups emerged that considered themselves above the ''sharia'' and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.

For these and other reasons, the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm. Some scholars, such as Al-Ghazali, helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it. [[William Chittick]] explains the position of Sufism and Sufis this way:
{{quote|In short, Muslim scholars who focused their energies on understanding the normative guidelines for the body came to be known as jurists, and those who held that the most important task was to train the mind in achieving correct understanding came to be divided into three main schools of thought: theology, philosophy, and Sufism. This leaves us with the third domain of human existence, the spirit. Most Muslims who devoted their major efforts to developing the spiritual dimensions of the human person came to be known as Sufis.{{sfn|Chittick|2007}}}}

===Traditional and Neo-Sufi groups {{anchor|Neo-Sufism}}===
[[File:5861-Linxia-Yu-Baba-Gongbei-main-building-roof.jpg|thumb|The mausoleum (''[[gongbei (Islamic architecture)|gongbei]]'') of [[Ma Laichi]] in [[Linxia City]], China]]

The traditional Sufi orders, which are in majority, emphasize the role of Sufism as a spiritual discipline within Islam. Therefore, the ''sharia'' (traditional Islamic law) and the [[Sunnah]] are seen as crucial for any Sufi aspirant. One proof traditional orders assert is that almost all the famous Sufi masters of the past [[Caliphate]]s were experts in ''sharia'' and were renowned as people with great ''[[Iman (concept)|Iman]]'' (faith) and excellent practice. Many were also ''[[Qadi]]s'' (sharia law judges) in courts. They held that Sufism was never distinct from Islam and to fully comprehend and practice Sufism one must be an observant Muslim.

"Neo-Sufism," "pseudo-Sufism," and "universal Sufism" are terms used to denote modern, Western forms or appropriations of Sufism that do not require adherence to shariah, or the Muslim faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Universal_Sufism.html?id=kXYwAAAAYAAJ|title=Universal Sufism|first=Hendrikus Johannes|last=Witteveen|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Element|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[L.P. Elwell-Sutton|Elwell-Sutton, L. P.]] (May 1975). "Sufism &amp; Pseudo-Sufism". Encounter XLIV (5): 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are not always accepted by those it is applied to. For example, the Afghan-Scottish teacher [[Idries Shah]] has been described as a neo-Sufi by the Gurdjieffian [[James Moore (Cornish author)|James Moore]].&lt;ref name="gurdjieff-legacy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gurdjieff-legacy.org/40articles/neosufism.htm |title=Neo-Sufism: The Case of Idries Shah by James Moore |publisher=gurdjieff-legacy.org |accessdate=26 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724030211/http://www.gurdjieff-legacy.org/40articles/neosufism.htm |archivedate=24 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufi Order Ināyati|The Sufi Order in the West]] was founded by [[Inayat Khan]], teaching the essential unity of all faiths, and accepting members of all creeds. [[Sufism Reoriented]] is an offshoot of it charted by the [[syncretism|syncretistic]] teacher [[Meher Baba]]. The [[Golden Sufi Center]] exists in England, Switzerland and the United States. It was founded by [[Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee]] to continue the work of his teacher [[Irina Tweedie]], herself a practitioner of both [[Hinduism]] and neo-Sufism. Other Western Sufi organisations include the Sufi Foundation of America and the [[International Association of Sufism]].

Western Neo-Sufi practices may differ from traditional forms, for instance having mixed-gender meetings and less emphasis on the Qur'an.

==Theoretical perspectives==
[[File:Munqidh min al-dalal (last page).jpg|thumb|The works of Al-Ghazali firmly defended the concepts of Sufism within the Islamic faith.]]

Traditional Islamic scholars have recognized two major branches within the practice of Sufism, and use this as one key to differentiating among the approaches of different masters and devotional lineages.&lt;ref name="Heart 2008"&gt;Muhammad Emin Er, ''Laws of the Heart: A Practical Introduction to the Sufi Order'', Shifâ Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand there is the order from the signs to the Signifier (or from the arts to the Artisan). In this branch, the seeker begins by purifying the lower self of every corrupting influence that stands in the way of recognizing all of creation as the work of God, as God's active Self-disclosure or theophany.&lt;ref&gt;For a systematic description of the diseases of the heart that are to be overcome in order for this perspective to take root, see Hamza Yusuf, ''Purification of the Heart: Signs, Symptoms and Cures of the Spiritual Diseases of the Heart'', {{ISBN|978-1-929694-15-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the way of Imam Al-Ghazali and of the majority of the Sufi orders.

On the other hand, there is the order from the Signifier to His signs, from the Artisan to His works. In this branch the seeker experiences divine attraction (''[[jadhba]]''), and is able to enter the order with a glimpse of its endpoint, of direct apprehension of the Divine Presence towards which all spiritual striving is directed. This does not replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from a different point of entry into the path. This is the way primarily of the masters of the Naqshbandi and [[Shadhili]] orders.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning this, and for an excellent discussion of the concept of attraction (''jadhba''), see especially the Introduction to Abdullah Nur ad-Din Durkee, ''The School of the Shadhdhuliyyah, Volume One: Orisons'', {{ISBN|977-00-1830-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary scholars may also recognize a third branch, attributed to the late [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] scholar [[Said Nursi]] and explicated in his vast Qur'an commentary called the [[Risale-i Nur]]. This approach entails strict adherence to the way of Muhammad, in the understanding that this wont, or ''[[sunnah]]'', proposes a complete devotional spirituality adequate to those without access to a master of the Sufi way.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Emin Er, ''al-Wasilat al-Fasila'', unpublished MS.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contributions to other domains of scholarship===
Sufism has contributed significantly to the elaboration of theoretical perspectives in many domains of intellectual endeavor. For instance, the doctrine of "subtle centers" or centers of subtle cognition (known as ''[[Lataif-e-sitta]]'') addresses the matter of the awakening of spiritual intuition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nurmuhammad.com/HeartLevels/coverLataif5levelsofheart.htm Realities of The Heart] Lataif&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these subtle centers or ''latâ'if'' are thought of as faculties that are to be purified sequentially in order to bring the seeker's wayfaring to completion. A concise and useful summary of this system from a living exponent of this tradition has been published by [[Muhammad Emin Er]].&lt;ref name="Heart 2008"/&gt;

[[Sufi psychology]] has influenced many areas of thinking both within and outside of Islam, drawing primarily upon three concepts. [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] (both an [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|imam]] in the [[Shia]] tradition and a respected scholar and link in chains of Sufi transmission in all Islamic sects) held that human beings are dominated by a lower self called the [[nafs]] (self, ego, person), a faculty of spiritual intuition called the [[qalb]] (heart), and [[ruh]] (soul). These interact in various ways, producing the spiritual types of the tyrant (dominated by ''nafs''), the person of faith and moderation (dominated by the spiritual heart), and the person lost in love for God (dominated by the ''ruh'').{{sfn|Schimmel|2013}}

Of note with regard to the spread of Sufi psychology in the West is [[Robert Frager]], a Sufi teacher authorized in the [[Khalwati]] [[Jerrahi]] order. Frager was a trained psychologist, born in the United States, who converted to Islam in the course of his practice of Sufism and wrote extensively on Sufism and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Robert Frager, ''Heart, Self &amp; Soul: The Sufi Psychology of Growth, Balance, and Harmony'', {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0778-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sufi cosmology]] and [[Sufi metaphysics]] are also noteworthy areas of intellectual accomplishment.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Devotional practices of Sufis==
[[File:Dhikr Rifa-iyya.jpg|thumb|Sufi gathering engaged in ''dhikr'']]
The devotional practices of Sufis vary widely. This is because an acknowledged and authorized master of the Sufi path is in effect a physician of the heart, able to diagnose the seeker's impediments to knowledge and pure intention in serving God, and to prescribe to the seeker a course of treatment appropriate to his or her maladies. The consensus among Sufi scholars is that the seeker cannot self-diagnose, and that it can be extremely harmful to undertake any of these practices alone and without formal authorization.&lt;ref&gt;Hakim Moinuddin Chisti, ''The Book of Sufi Healing'', {{ISBN|978-0-89281-043-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prerequisites to practice include rigorous adherence to Islamic norms (ritual prayer in its five prescribed times each day, the fast of Ramadan, and so forth). Additionally, the seeker ought to be firmly grounded in supererogatory practices known from the life of Muhammad (such as the "sunna prayers"). This is in accordance with the words, attributed to God, of the following, a famous ''[[Hadith Qudsi]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My servant draws near to Me through nothing I love more than that which I have made obligatory for him. My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is also necessary for the seeker to have a correct creed (''aqidah''),&lt;ref&gt;For an introduction to the normative creed of Islam as espoused by the consensus of scholars, see Hamza Yusuf, ''The Creed of Imam al-Tahawi'', {{ISBN|978-0-9702843-9-6}}, and Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Maghnisawi, ''Imam Abu Hanifa's Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar Explained'', {{ISBN|978-1-933764-03-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and to embrace with certainty its tenets.&lt;ref&gt;The meaning of ''certainty'' in this context is emphasized in Muhammad Emin Er, ''The Soul of Islam: Essential Doctrines and Beliefs'', Shifâ Publishers, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-0-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued to his or her credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).

Sufi practices, while attractive to some, are not a ''means'' for gaining knowledge. The traditional scholars of Sufism hold it as absolutely axiomatic that knowledge of God is not a psychological state generated through breath control. Thus, practice of "techniques" is not the cause, but instead the ''occasion'' for such knowledge to be obtained (if at all), given proper prerequisites and proper guidance by a master of the way. Furthermore, the emphasis on practices may obscure a far more important fact: The seeker is, in a sense, to become a broken person, stripped of all habits through the practice of (in the words of Imam Al-Ghazali) solitude, silence, sleeplessness, and hunger.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular the introduction by T. J. Winter to Abu Hamid Muhammad al-Ghazali, ''Al-Ghazali on Disciplining the Soul and on Breaking the Two Desires: Books XXII and XXIII of the Revival of the Religious Sciences'', {{ISBN|978-0-946621-43-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magic may have also been a part of some Sufi practices, notably in India.&lt;ref&gt;Akbar Ahmed, Diiscovering Islam, Making sense of Muslim History and Society, {{ISBN|0-415-28525-9}}(Pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2017}}

===Dhikr===
{{main|Dhikr}}
[[File:Isma allah zat-new.png|thumb|left|The name of Allah as written on the disciple's heart, according to the Sarwari Qadri Order]]
''Dhikr'' is the remembrance of Allah commanded in the [[Qur'an]] for all [[Muslims]] through a specific devotional act, such as the repetition of divine names, supplications and aphorisms from ''hadith'' literature and the Quran. More generally, ''dhikr'' takes a wide range and various layers of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Jawadi Amuli, [http://islamiceducationcenter.org/pdf/dhikr_and_the_wisdom_behind_it.pdf "Dhikr and the Wisdom Behind It"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes ''dhikr'' as any activity in which the Muslim maintains awareness of Allah. To engage in ''dhikr'' is to practice consciousness of the Divine Presence and [[Love of God#Islam|love]], or "to seek a state of godwariness". The Quran refers to Muhammad as the very embodiment of ''dhikr'' of Allah (65:10–11). Some types of ''dhikr'' are prescribed for all Muslims and do not require Sufi initiation or the prescription of a Sufi master because they are deemed to be good for every seeker under every circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;Hakim Moinuddin Chisti ''The Book of Sufi Healing'', {{ISBN|978-0-89281-043-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''dhikr'' may slightly vary among each order. Some Sufi orders&lt;ref name="naqshbandi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naqshbandi.org/dhikr/difference.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970529081521/http://naqshbandi.org/dhikr/difference.htm |archivedate=1997-05-29 |dead-url=yes |title=The Naqshbandi Way of Dhikr |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=26 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; engage in ritualized ''dhikr'' ceremonies, or ''[[sema]]''. ''Sema'' includes various forms of worship such as [[recitation]], [[singing]] (the most well known being the [[Qawwali]] music of the Indian subcontinent), [[instrumental music]], [[dance]] (most famously the [[Sufi whirling]] of the [[Mevlevi order]]), [[incense]], [[meditation]], [[religious ecstasy|ecstasy]], and [[altered state of consciousness|trance]].&lt;ref&gt;Touma 1996, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Sufi orders stress and place extensive reliance upon ''dhikr''. This practice of ''dhikr'' is called ''[[Dhikr-e-Qulb]]'' (invocation of Allah within the heartbeats). The basic idea in this practice is to visualize the Allah as having been written on the disciple's heart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goharshahi.net/images/books_files/menar-e-noor_files/What%20is%20Remembrance%20and%20what%20is%20Contemplation.htm What is Remembrance and what is Contemplation?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415182616/http://www.goharshahi.net/images/books_files/menar-e-noor_files/What%20is%20Remembrance%20and%20what%20is%20Contemplation.htm |date=2008-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muraqaba===
{{main|Muraqaba}}
The practice of ''muraqaba'' can be likened to the practices of [[meditation]] attested in many faith communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sultan-bahoo.com/en/tafakkur-and-muraqbah-meditation-and-concentration.html#Tafakkur-Muraqbah|title=Muraqaba|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609000104/http://www.sultan-bahoo.com/en/tafakkur-and-muraqbah-meditation-and-concentration.html#Tafakkur-Muraqbah|archivedate=2015-06-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While variation exists, one description of the practice within a Naqshbandi lineage reads as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He is to collect all of his bodily senses in concentration, and to cut himself off from all preoccupation and notions that inflict themselves upon the heart. And thus he is to turn his full consciousness towards God Most High while saying three times: "''Ilahî anta maqsûdî wa-ridâka matlûbî''—my God, you are my Goal and Your good pleasure is what I seek". Then he brings to his heart the Name of the Essence—Allâh—and as it courses through his heart he remains attentive to its meaning, which is "Essence without likeness". The seeker remains aware that He is Present, Watchful, Encompassing of all, thereby exemplifying the meaning of his saying (may God bless him and grant him peace): "Worship God as though you see Him, for if you do not see Him, He sees you". And likewise the prophetic tradition: "The most favored level of faith is to know that God is witness over you, wherever you may be".&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Emin Er, ''Laws of the Heart: A Practical Introduction to the Sufi Path'', {{ISBN|978-0-9815196-1-6}}, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sufi whirling===
{{Main|Sufi whirling}}
[[File:Whriling dervishes, Rumi Fest 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Whirling Dervishes]], at Rumi Fest 2007]]
[[Sufi whirling]] (or ''Sufi spinning'') is a form of [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]] or physically active [[meditation]] which originated among Sufis, and which is still practised by the Sufi [[Dervish]]es of the [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] order. It is a customary dance performed within the ''sema'', through which dervishes (also called ''semazens'', from [[Persian language|Persian]] {{lang|fa|سماعزن}}) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or kemal. This is sought through abandoning one's [[nafs]], [[Ego (spirituality)|egos]] or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on [[God]], and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the [[Solar System]] orbiting the sun.&lt;ref name="MOA sema"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|title=The Sema of the Mevlevi|publisher=Mevlevi Order of America|accessdate=2009-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121221021339/http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm|archivedate=2012-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As explained by Sufis:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whirlingdervishes.org/whirlingdervishes.htm The Whirling Dervishes of Rumi]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (''tennure'') represents the ego's shroud. By removing his black cloak (''hırka''), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevlâna Jalâluddîn Rumi says, "All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Music ===
''[[Qawwali]]'' is a form of Sufi devotional music popular in [[South Asia]], usually performed at ''[[dargah]]s''. Sufi saint [[Amir Khusrow]] is said to have infused Persian, Arabic Turkish and [[Indian classical music|Indian classical]] musical styles to create the genre in the 13th century. The songs are classified into [[hamd]], [[Na`at|na'at]], [[manqabat]], [[marsiya]] or [[ghazal]], among others. The songs lasting for about 15 to 30 minutes, are performed by a group of singers, and instruments including the [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[tabla]] and [[dholak]] are used. Pakistani singing maestro [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] is credited with popularizing [[qawwali]] all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320015139/http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/nusrat_fateh_ali_khan_28502/en_US|title=Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan : National Geographic World Music|date=2013-03-20|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Walī'' ({{lang-ar|ولي}}, plural {{transl|ar|''ʾawliyāʾ''}} {{lang|ar|أولياء}}) is an Arabic word whose literal meanings include "custodian", "protector", "helper", and "friend."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ejtaal.net/aa/#hw4=1302,ll=3066,ls=79,la=4919,sg=1252,ha=906,br=1072,pr=171,aan=742,mgf=869,vi=392,kz=3008,mr=805,mn=1581,uqw=1902,umr=1196,ums=1010,umj=961,ulq=1833,uqa=460,uqq=444 Hans Wehr, p.  1289]&lt;/ref&gt; In the vernacular, it is most commonly used by Muslims to indicate an Islamic [[saint]], otherwise referred to by the more literal "friend of God."&lt;ref name="John Renard 2008"&gt;John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008); Idem., ''Tales of God Friends: Islamic Hagiography in Translation'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009), et passim.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radtke etal"&gt;Radtke, B., Lory, P., Zarcone, Th., DeWeese, D., Gaborieau, M., F.

Radtke, ''Drei Schriften des Theosophen von Tirmid̲'', ii (Beirut-Stuttgart, 1996), pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt; and particular verses of the [[Quran]] and certain ''hadith'' were interpreted by early Muslim thinkers as "documentary evidence"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; of the existence of saints.

Since the first Muslim hagiographies were written during the period when Sufism began its rapid expansion, many of the figures who later came to be regarded as the major saints in Sunni Islam were the early Sufi mystics, like [[Hasan of Basra]] (d. 728), [[Farqad Sabakhi]] (d. 729), [[Dawud Tai]] (d. 777-81) [[Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya]] (d. 801), [[Maruf Karkhi]] (d. 815), and Junayd of Baghdad (d. 910).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; From the twelfth to the fourteenth century, "the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of Sufism ... into orders or brotherhoods."&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"&gt;Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam: Language and Meaning'' (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2009), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In the common expressions of Islamic piety of this period, the saint was understood to be "a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples."&lt;ref name="Titus Burckhardt 2009 p. 99"/&gt;

===Visitation===
{{Main|Ziyara}}
[[File:Bidokht 8810 (19)-W.jpg|thumb|275.994x275.994px|Sufi mosque in Esfahan, Iran]]
In popular Sufism (i.e. devotional practices that have achieved currency in world cultures through Sufi influence), one common practice is to [[Ziyarat|visit or make pilgrimages]] to the tombs of saints, renowned scholars, and righteous people. This is a particularly common practice in South Asia, where famous tombs include such saints as [[Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani|Sayyid Ali Hamadani]] in [[Kulob]], Tajikistan; [[Afaq Khoja|Afāq Khoja]], near [[Kashgar]], China; [[Lal Shahbaz Qalandar]] in [[Sindh]]; [[Ali Hajwari]] in [[Lahore]], Pakistan; [[Bawaldin Zikrya]] in [[Multan]] Pakistan; [[Moinuddin Chishti]] in [[Ajmer]], India; [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] in [[Delhi]], India; and [[Shah Jalal]] in [[Sylhet]], Bangladesh.

Likewise, in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]], Morocco, a popular destination for such pious visitation is the [[Zaouia Moulay Idriss II]] and the yearly visitation to see the current Sheikh of the Qadiri Boutchichi [[Tariqah]], Sheikh Sidi Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi to celebrate the [[Mawlid]] (which is usually televised on Moroccan National television).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Miracles===
{{Main|Karamat}}

In Islamic mysticism, ''karamat'' ({{lang-ar|کرامات}} ''karāmāt'', pl. of {{lang|ar|کرامة}} ''karāmah'', lit. generosity, high-mindedness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hans Wehr, J. Milton Cowan| year=1979 | title=A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic|publisher=Spoken Language Services|edition=4th|url=https://ejtaal.net/aa/#q=krm}}&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to supernatural wonders performed by [[Wali|Muslim saints]]. In the technical vocabulary of Islamic religious sciences, the singular form ''karama'' has a sense similar to ''[[charism]]'', a favor or spiritual gift freely bestowed by God.&lt;ref name=karama&gt;Gardet, L., “Karāma”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; The marvels ascribed to Islamic saints have included supernatural physical actions, predictions of the future, and "interpretation of the secrets of hearts".&lt;ref name=karama/&gt; Historically, a "belief in the miracles of saints (''karāmāt al-awliyāʾ'', literally 'marvels of the friends [of God]')" has been "a requirement in Sunni Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, "Faithful Dissenters," ''Journal of Sufi Studies'' 1 (2012), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecution==
{{Main|Persecution of Sufis}}
{{see also|Sufi–Salafi relations}}
Persecution of Sufis and Sufism has included destruction of Sufi shrines and mosques, suppression of orders, and discrimination against adherents in a number of Muslim-majority countries. The Turkish Republican state banned all Sufi orders and abolished their institutions in 1925 after Sufis opposed the new secular order. The Iranian Islamic Republic has harassed Shia Sufis, reportedly for their lack of support for the government doctrine of "[[Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|governance of the jurist]]" (i.e., that the supreme [[Shiite]] jurist should be the nation's political leader).

In most other Muslim countries, attacks on Sufis and especially their shrines have come from [[Salafis]] who believe that practices such as [[Mawlid#Other uses of the term|celebration of the birthdays of Sufi saints]], and dhikr ("remembrance" of God) ceremonies are [[bid‘ah]] or impure innovation, and polytheistic ([[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]]).&lt;ref name="ibrahim"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/may/10/islam-sufi-salafi-egypt-religion Salafi intolerance threatens Sufis] |Baher Ibrahim |guardian.co.uk |10 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mir&gt;{{cite web|last=Mir|first=Tariq|title=Kashmir: From Sufi to Salafi|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/kashmir-sufi-resurgence-salafi-islam-belief-conflict-rising-salafism-muslim-islam|work=November 5, 2012|publisher=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=violence&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamopediaonline.org/country-profile/egypt/salafists/salafi-violence-against-sufis|title=Salafi Violence against Sufis|publisher=[[Islamopedia Online]]|accessdate=24 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530232126/http://www.islamopediaonline.org/country-profile/egypt/salafists/salafi-violence-against-sufis|archive-date=2013-05-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent Sufis==

===Abdul-Qadir Gilani===
[[File:Roof hafez tomb.jpg|thumb|right|[[Islamic geometric patterns|Geometric tiling]] on the underside of the dome of Hafiz Shirazi's tomb in [[Shiraz]]]]

[[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]] (1077–1166) was a Persian [[Hanbali]] jurist and Sufi based in [[Baghdad]]. Qadiriyya was his patronym. Gilani spent his early life in Na'if, the town of his birth. There, he pursued the study of [[Hanbali]] law. [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]] gave Gilani lessons in [[fiqh]]. He was given lessons about ''hadith'' by Abu Bakr ibn Muzaffar. He was given lessons about Tafsir by Abu Muhammad Ja'far, a commentator. His Sufi spiritual instructor was Abu'l-Khair Hammad ibn Muslim al-Dabbas. After completing his education, Gilani left Baghdad. He spent twenty-five years as a reclusive wanderer in the desert regions of Iraq. In 1127, Gilani returned to Baghdad and began to preach to the public. He joined the teaching staff of the school belonging to his own teacher, [[Abu Saeed Mubarak Makhzoomi]], and was popular with students. In the morning he taught ''hadith'' and ''[[tafsir]]'', and in the afternoon he held discourse on the science of the heart and the virtues of the Quran.

===Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili===

[[Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili]] (died 1258), the founder of the [[Shadhiliyya]] order, introduced ''dhikr jahri'' (the remembrance of God out loud, as opposed to the silent ''dhikr''). He taught that his followers need not abstain from what Islam has not forbidden, but to be grateful for what God has bestowed upon them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shazuli.com/thareeqush-shukr.html|title=Thareeqush Shukr|publisher=Shazuli.com|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the majority of Sufis, who preach to deny oneself and to destroy the ego-self (''[[nafs]]'') "Order of Patience" (Tariqus-Sabr), Shadhiliyya is formulated to be "Order of Gratitude" (Tariqush-Shukr). Imam Shadhili also gave eighteen valuable ''[[Manzil|hizbs]]'' (litanies) to his followers out of which the notable ''Hizb al-Bahr''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deenislam.co.uk/mix/Hizb_ul_Bahr.htm|title=Deen islam -Hizb ul Bahr – Litany of the Sea|publisher=|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is recited worldwide even today.

Bayazid Bastami is a very well recognized and influential Sufi personality. Bastami was born in 804 in [[Bastam]]. Bayazid is regarded for his devout commitment to the [[Sunnah]] and his dedication to fundamental Islamic principals and practices.

===Bawa Muhaiyaddeen===
[[Bawa Muhaiyaddeen]] (died 1986) is a Sufi Sheikh from Sri Lanka. He was first found by a group of religious pilgrims in the early 1900s meditating in the jungles of Kataragama in Sri Lanka (Ceylon). Awed and inspired by his personality and the depth of his wisdom, he was invited to a nearby village. Since that time, people of all walks of life from paupers to prime ministers belonging to all religious and ethnic backgrounds have flocked to see Sheikh Bawa Muhaiyaddeen to seek comfort, guidance and help. Sheikh Bawa Muhaiyaddeen tirelessly spent the rest of his life preaching, healing and comforting the many souls that came to see him.

===Ibn Arabi===
Muhyiddin Muhammad b. 'Ali [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn 'Arabi]] (or Ibn al-'Arabi) (AH 561 – AH 638; July 28, 1165 – November 10, 1240) is considered to be one of the most important Sufi masters, although he never founded any order (''tariqa''). His writings, especially al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya and Fusus al-hikam, have been studied within all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of ''tawhid'' (Divine Unity), though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to initiates. Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of ''wahdat al-wujud'' (the Oneness of Being). He himself considered his writings to have been divinely inspired. As he expressed the Way to one of his close disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servant-hood (''ʿubudiyya''), and that there may never be in your soul a longing for any existing thing'.&lt;ref&gt;K. al-Wasa'il, quoted in ''The Unlimited Mercifier'', Stephen Hirtenstein, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junayd of Baghdad===
[[File:Shams al-Ma'arif.jpg|thumb|A manuscript of Sufi [[Islamic theology]], ''[[Shams al-Ma'arif]]'' (The Book of the Sun of Gnosis), was written by the [[Algeria]]n Sufi master [[Ahmad al-Buni]] during the 12th century.]]

Junayd of Baghdad (830–910) was one of the great early Sufis. His order was Junaidia, which links to the golden chain of many Sufi orders. He laid the groundwork for sober mysticism in contrast to that of God-intoxicated Sufis like al-Hallaj, Bayazid Bastami and Abusaeid Abolkheir. During the trial of al-Hallaj, his former disciple, the Caliph of the time demanded his fatwa. In response, he issued this fatwa: "From the outward appearance he is to die and we judge according to the outward appearance and God knows better". He is referred to by Sufis as Sayyid-ut Taifa—i.e., the leader of the group. He lived and died in the city of Baghdad.

===Mansur Al-Hallaj===
[[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] (died 922) is renowned for his claim, ''Ana-l-Haqq'' ("I am The Truth"). His refusal to recant this utterance, which was regarded as [[apostasy]], led to a long trial. He was imprisoned for 11 years in a Baghdad prison, before being tortured and publicly dismembered on March 26, 922. He is still revered by Sufis for his willingness to embrace torture and death rather than recant. It is said that during his prayers, he would say "O Lord! You are the guide of those who are passing through the Valley of Bewilderment. If I am a heretic, enlarge my heresy".&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of the Saints, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moinuddin Chishti===
[[File:Sufi Prayer Book LACMA M.87.21.jpg|thumb|A Mughal-era Sufi prayer book from the Chishti order]]

[[Moinuddin Chishti|Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti]] was born in 1141 and died in 1236. Also known as ''Gharīb Nawāz'' ("Benefactor of the Poor"), he is the most famous Sufi saint of the Chishti Order. Moinuddin Chishti introduced and established the order in the Indian subcontinent. The initial spiritual chain or silsila of the Chishti order in India, comprising Moinuddin Chishti, [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki|Bakhtiyar Kaki]], [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar|Baba Farid]], [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] (each successive person being the disciple of the previous one), constitutes the great Sufi saints of Indian history. Moinuddin Chishtī turned towards India, reputedly after a dream in which Muhammad blessed him to do so. After a brief stay at Lahore, he reached [[Ajmer]] along with Sultan [[Muhammad of Ghor|Shahāb-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori]], and settled down there. In Ajmer, he attracted a substantial following, acquiring a great deal of respect amongst the residents of the city. Moinuddin Chishtī practiced the Sufi ''Sulh-e-Kul'' (peace to all) concept to promote understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya===
[[File:Rabia al-Adawiyya.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of Rabi'a [[Mill (grinding)|grinding grain]] from a [[Persian language|Persian]] dictionary]]

[[Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya]] or Rabia of Basra (died 801) was a mystic who represents countercultural elements of Sufism, especially with regards to the status and power of women. Prominent Sufi leader [[Hasan of Basra]] is said to have castigated himself before her superior merits and sincere virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Leila. ''Women and Gender in Islam''. Yale University Press, 1992, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabi'a was born either a slave or a servant of very poor origin, released by her master when he awoke one night to see the light of sanctity shining above her head.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Leila. ''Women and Gender in Islam''. Yale University Press, 1992, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabi'a al-Adawiyya is known for her teachings and emphasis on the centrality of the love of God to a holy life.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Leila. ''Women and Gender in Islam''. Yale University Press, 1992, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; She is said to have proclaimed, running down the streets of [[Basra]], Iraq:
{{quote | text = O God! If I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell, and if I worship You in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise. But if I worship You for Your Own sake, grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty. | source = Rabi'a al-Adawiyya}}

She died in [[Jerusalem]] and is thought to have been buried in the [[Chapel of the Ascension (Jerusalem)|Chapel of the Ascension]].

== Shrines ==
A ''[[Dargah]]'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: درگاه ''dargâh'' or درگه ''dargah'', also in [[Urdu]]) is a [[shrine]] built over the grave of a revered religious figure, often a Sufi [[saint]] or [[dervish]]. Sufis often visit the shrine for [[ziyarat]], a term associated with religious visits and pilgrimages. Dargahs are often associated with Sufi eating and meeting rooms and hostels, called ''[[khanqah]]'' or hospices. They usually include a mosque, meeting rooms, Islamic religious schools ([[madrassas]]), residences for a teacher or caretaker, hospitals, and other buildings for community purposes.

==Major Sufi orders==
{{main|Tariqa|List of Sufi orders}}
[[File:Syariah-thariqah-hakikah2.jpg|thumb|"Tariqat" in the Four Spiritual Stations: The Four Stations, ''sharia'', tariqa, [[haqiqa]]. The fourth station, ''[[marifa]]'', which is considered "unseen", is actually ''the center'' of the ''haqiqa'' region. It is the essence of all four stations.]]

The term ''Tariqa'' is used for a school or order of Sufism, or especially for the mystical teaching and spiritual practices of such an order with the aim of seeking [[haqiqa|ḥaqīqah]] (ultimate truth). A tariqa has a [[murshid]] (guide) who plays the role of leader or spiritual director. The members or followers of a tariqa are known as ''[[Murid|murīdīn]]'' (singular ''murīd''), meaning "desirous", viz. "desiring the knowledge of knowing God and loving God".&lt;ref&gt;SILVA FILHO, Mário Alves da.

===Chishti===
{{main|Chishti Order}}

The Chishti Order ({{lang-fa|{{big|چشتیہ}}}}) was founded by ([[Khawaja]]) [[Abu Ishaq Shami]] ("the Syrian"; died 941) who brought Sufism to the town of [[Chisht]], some 95 miles east of [[Herat]] in present-day Afghanistan. Before returning to the Levant, Shami initiated, trained and deputized the son of the local [[Emir]] (Khwaja) [[Abu Ahmad Abdal]] (died 966). Under the leadership of Abu Ahmad's descendants, the ''Chishtiyya'' as they are also known, flourished as a regional mystical order.

===Naqshbandi===
{{main|Naqshbandi}}

The Naqshbandi order is one of the major Sufi orders of Islam, previously known as Siddiqiyya as the order stems from Mohammad through Abū Bakr as-Șiddīq. It is considered by some to be a "sober" order known for its silent ''dhikr'' (remembrance of God) rather than the vocalized forms of ''dhikr'' common in other orders. The word "''Naqshbandi''" ({{lang|fa|{{big|نقشبندی}}}}) is [[Persian language|Persian]], taken from the name of the founder of the order, [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]]. Some have said that the translation means "related to the image-maker", some also consider it to mean "Pattern Maker" rather than "image maker", and interpret "Naqshbandi" to mean "Reformer of Patterns", and others consider it to mean "Way of the Chain" or "[[Silsilat al-dhahab]]".

===Nimatullahi===

The order is one of the most widespread of the Sufi orders in the Islamic world, and has a huge presence in [[Central Asia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Balkans]] and much of [[East Africa|East]] and [[West Africa]]. The Qadiriyyah have not developed any distinctive doctrines or teachings outside of mainstream Islam. They believe in the fundamental principles of Islam, but interpreted through mystical experience.

===Senussi===
{{main|Senussi}}

Senussi is a religious-political Sufi order established by [[Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi]]. Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi founded this movement due to his criticism of the Egyptian [[ulema]].

==Reception==

===Perception outside Islam===
[[File:Sudan sufis.jpg|thumb|A choreographed Sufi performance on a Friday in Sudan]]
Sufi mysticism has long exercised a fascination upon the Western world, and especially its Orientalist scholars.&lt;ref name=Geaves /&gt; Figures like Rumi have become well known in the United States, where Sufism is perceived as a peaceful and apolitical form of Islam.&lt;ref name=Geaves&gt;Ron Geaves, Theodore Gabriel, Yvonne Haddad, Jane Idleman Smith: ''Islam and the West Post 9/11'', Ashgate Publishing Ltd., p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=23704 |last1=Corbett |first1=Rosemary R. |title=Making Moderate Islam: Sufism, Service, and the "Ground Zero Mosque" Controversy |publisher=Stanford University Press |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orientalists have proposed a variety of diverse theories pertaining to the nature of Sufism, such as it being influenced by [[Neoplatonism]] or as an [[Aryan race|Aryan]] historical reaction against "[[Semitic people|Semitic]]" cultural influence.&lt;ref name="nasr"/&gt; [[Hossein Nasr]] states that the preceding theories are false according to the point of view of Sufism.&lt;ref name="nasr"/&gt;

The Islamic Institute in Mannheim, Germany, which works towards the integration of [[Europe]] and Muslims, sees Sufism as particularly suited for interreligious dialogue and intercultural harmonisation in democratic and pluralist societies; it has described Sufism as a symbol of tolerance and [[humanism]]—nondogmatic, flexible and non-violent.&lt;ref&gt;Jamal Malik, John R. Hinnells: ''Sufism in the West'', Routledge, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Philip Jenkins]], a Professor at Baylor University, "the Sufis are much more than tactical allies for the West: they are, potentially, the greatest hope for pluralism and democracy within Muslim nations." Likewise, several governments and organisations have advocated the promotion of Sufism as a means of combating intolerant and [[Islam and violence|violent strains of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Philip Jenkins|authorlink1=Philip Jenkins|title=Mystical power|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/01/25/mystical_power/?page=full|publisher=Globe Newspaper Company|accessdate=26 June 2014|date=January 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Chinese and Russian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Tom Parfitt|title=The battle for the soul of Chechnya|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/22/chechnya.tomparfitt|accessdate=26 June 2014|agency=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; governments openly favor Sufism as the best means of protecting against Islamist subversion. The British government, especially following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], has favoured Sufi groups in its battle against [[Muslim extremist]] currents. The influential [[RAND Corporation]], an American think-tank, issued a major report titled "Building Moderate Muslim Networks," which urged the US government to form links with and bolster&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sufism: Of saints and sinners|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12792544|publisher=The Economist Newspaper|accessdate=26 June 2014|date=Dec 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim groups that opposed Islamist extremism.

===Influence on Judaism===
{{Original research section|date=July 2017}}
{{see also|Jewish philosophy}}
Both Judaism and Islam are monotheistic. There is evidence that Sufism did influence the development of some schools of Jewish philosophy and ethics. In the first writing of this kind, we see "Kitab al-Hidayah ila Fara'iḍ al-Ḳulub", ''[[Duties of the Heart]]'', of [[Bahya ibn Paquda]]. This book was translated by [[Judah ibn Tibbon]] into [[Hebrew]] under the title "Ḥōḇōṯ Ha-lleḇāḇōṯ".&lt;ref&gt;''A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Bahya ibn Paquda's Duties of the Heart'', Diana Lobel&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The precepts prescribed by the [[Torah]] number 613 only; those dictated by the intellect are innumerable.}}

It is noteworthy that in the ethical writings of the Sufis [[Al-Kusajri]] and [[Harawi (genre)|Al-Harawi]] there are sections which treat of the same subjects as those treated in the "Ḥovot ha-Lebabot" and which bear the same titles: e.g., "Bab al-Tawakkul"; "Bab al-Taubah"; "Bab al-Muḥasabah"; "Bab al-Tawaḍu'"; "Bab al-Zuhd". In the ninth gate, Baḥya directly quotes sayings of the Sufis, whom he calls ''Perushim''. However, the author of the ''Ḥōḇōṯ Ha-lleḇāḇōṯ'' did not go so far as to approve of the asceticism of the Sufis, although he showed a marked predilection for their ethical principles.

[[Avraham son of Rambam|Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon]], the son of the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]], believed that Sufi practices and doctrines continue the tradition of the Biblical prophets. See Sefer Hammaspiq, "Happerishuth", Chapter 11 ("Ha-mmaʿaḇāq") s.v. hithbonen efo be-masoreth mufla'a zo, citing the Talmudic explanation of Jeremiah 13:27 in Chagigah 5b; in Rabbi Yaakov Wincelberg's translation, "The Way of Serving God" (Feldheim), p.&amp;nbsp;429 and above, p.&amp;nbsp;427. Also see ibid., Chapter 10 ("Iqquḇim"), s.v. wa-halo yoḏeʾaʿ atta; in "The Way of Serving God", p.&amp;nbsp;371.

Abraham Maimuni's principal work is originally composed in [[Judeo-Arabic]] and entitled "כתאב כפאיה אלעאבדין" ''Kitāb Kifāyah al-'Ābidīn'' ("A Comprehensive Guide for the Servants of God"). From the extant surviving portion it is conjectured that Maimuni's treatise was three times as long as his father's Guide for the Perplexed. In the book, Maimuni evidences a great appreciation for, and affinity to, Sufism. Followers of his path continued to foster a Jewish-Sufi form of pietism for at least a century, and he is rightly considered the founder of this pietistic school, which was centered in [[Egypt]].

The followers of this path, which they called, interchangeably, Hasidism (not to be confused with the [later] [[Jewish]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement) or Sufism (''Tasawwuf''), practiced spiritual retreats, solitude, fasting and sleep deprivation. The Jewish Sufis maintained their own [[Sufi order|brotherhood]], guided by a religious leader—like a Sufi [[sheikh]].&lt;ref name="revues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcrfj.revues.org/index2312.html |title=Jewish pietism of the Sufi type |author=Mireille Loubet |publisher=bcrfj.revues.org|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===

The 13h century Persian poet [[Rumi]], is considered one of the most influential figures of Sufism, as well as one of the greatest poets of all time.

Trika in Sanskrit means "three" and it is often described  many triad systems eleborated in Kashmiri Shaivism.  

One Trika Triad is the power of will, knowledge and action. Any action of any being, including God, is subject to three fundamental energies: Ichcha, Kriya and Ngana.&lt;ref&gt;The Trika Śaivism of Kashmir, Moti Lal Pandit, pag. 14&lt;/ref&gt;. Ichcha or Will is in the beginning of any action or process.Jnana by which the action is clearly expressed first in mind, before it is put into action.Then comes Kriyā, the energy of action,  Anu is a ''microcosm'', a complete image, on a reduced scale, of the ''macrocosm'', and in permanent resonance on multiple levels with the ''macrocosm'' (universe). The resonance (link) between the ''microcosm'' and the ''macrocosm'' is [[Shakti|Sakti]], the only one who can help ''Anu'' recover his lost knowledge - that he is one with [[Shiva|Siva]]. This is all possible because of the completely free will of [[Shiva|Siva]] - [[Svatantrya]] Sakti.

'''Tsang Lap Chuen''' (Chinese: 曾立存) is a Chinese philosopher in the analytic tradition. He is known for his theory of the sublime in which he presents the notion of limit-situations in life as being central to the human experience.

==Personal life==
[[File:Tsang in Oxford in 2012.jpg|thumb|Tsang in Oxford in 2012]]
Tsang was born in [[Wuhua County]], Guangdong, China on 7 October 1943, the son of Tsang Kwok Ying (1906–1999), District Minister of [[:zh:基督教香港崇真會|Tsung Tsin Mission]] (formerly Basle Mission) of Hong Kong, and Wong Kun Tsing (1916–2014), a devout Christian committed to the church and family. They moved to Hong Kong when he was two years old.&lt;ref&gt; [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tsang_L._C._1946_HK.jpg A picture of Tsang (center) with siblings taken in Kau Yan Church, Hong Kong in 1946.] &lt;/ref&gt; Today he and his wife Tse Wai Yee live in Hong Kong. They have two sons, Tze Yee and Tze Yan.

==Education and work==

From 1969 to 1974, he continued his study at HKU for a PhD in philosophical method, which ended with his withdrawal due to gradual digression of his research interests. From 1975 until 2004, he was a faculty member&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~cpro/enews2004/20040512.htm ''HKBU e-News'', Wed. 12 May, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; in general education and religious studies at [[Hong Kong Baptist University]]; from 1978 to 1979, its exchange professor to [[Malone University|Malone College]], USA; and, from 1995 to 2000, head of its Department of Religion and Philosophy.

From 1985 to 1991 Tsang re-enrolled for the PhD program at HKU, this time in philosophy of religion, with the research topic of existential wonder.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Tsang Lap Chuen, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-2005.1991.tb07064.x/abstract "Wittgenstein, World and Wonder," ''New Blackfriars'', Vol. 72, No. 850 (1991), pp. 269–277]; reprinted in {{harvp|Tsang|1998|pp=147–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; To place the topic in a historical context, his supervisor F.C.T. Moore introduced him to Kant’s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' on the concept of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tsang|1998|pp=vii, xiii–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, he worked out a thesis&lt;ref&gt;The thesis is entitled [http://hub.hku.hk/handle/10722/34484 ''A Theory of the Sublime'' (1991), The HKU Scholars Hub.] See also ''The University of Hong Kong Gazette'', Vol. XL, No. 1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; on a new theory of the sublime in the tradition of [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]], [[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful|Burke]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], later published as ''The Sublime: Groundwork towards a Theory'' by the recommendation of [[Joseph A. Munitiz]], then the Master of [[Campion Hall, Oxford]].

==Theory of the Sublime==
In the light of [[Wittgenstein]] on "language games", [[Levi-Strauss#The structuralist approach to myth|Lévi-Strauss]] on "ritual and myth" and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] on "ideas and dreams",&lt;ref&gt;See also references in the book to F.C.T. Moore, [[Dan Sperber]], [[Martin Hollis (philosopher)|Martin Hollis]], [[Bernard Williams]], Robert C. Roberts, [[Harry Frankfurt]] and Malcolm Budd.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsang develops a conceptual framework of [i] construal, [ii] evocation, [iii] affectivity and [iv] instantiation, giving a coherent account of the elements that can be distinguished in the phenomenon of the sublime,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tsang|1998|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the event of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] as an exemplary instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tsang|1998|pp=45-46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the experience of the sublime, Longinus emphasises our contemplation and thought reaching the limit of the natural order of grandeur; Burke our self-preservation in situations which defy our existing capacities; and Kant our transcendence of the natural order as supersensible beings. Each of them is concerned with an aspect of the sublime which Tsang characterises, in general terms, as that which transports us to a self-realization at the limit of our existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tsang|1998|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory Tsang proposes, the sublime is concerned with a limit-situation in life and our self-realization in it such that the core of all experience of the sublime is an intensified awareness of our self-realization at a life-limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tsang|1998|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life-limits are of three kinds, the top limit to our being which borders on that which transcends the natural and the human, the bottom limit to our being which borders on the non-existent, and the median limit which designates the bloom of our being in its domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tsang|1998|pp=38–39}}. By our very nature, we desire affirmation at the summit, preservation at the basis, and equilibrium in the domain of being; {{harvp|Tsang|1998|p=125}}. Typical instances evocative of the sublime in the natural order are, e.g., [[Mount Everest]], a precipitous cliff and the fall of leaves in autumn, respectively; {{harvp|Tsang|1998|pp=41–42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; We come to an intensified awareness of our self-realization at a life-limit in our encounter with an object which is so construed that it elicits a set of thoughts and reactions pertaining to certain themes, including the limits of our powers and abilities, and the importance of being able to go up to or even beyond those limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tsang|1998|p=25}}. For instance, the Crucifixion may be construed in terms of the sublime in its three senses. As an object construed in terms of the sublime at the top limit in the affirmative mode, the Crucifixion may be looked upon as an authentic expression of autonomy at its perfection. As an object construed in terms of the sublime at the bottom limit in the preservative mode, the Crucifixion may be regarded as the infliction of the utmost torture on a human being. And then, as an object construed in terms of the sublime at the median limit in the appreciative mode, the Crucifixion may be depicted as God's act of reconciliation with man, making peace on earth. {{harvp|Tsang|1998|pp=45–46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As such the sublime is concerned with the notion of a limit to what can be said and thought and willed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tsang|1998|pp=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sublime is not an object ''per se'', but a particular manner in which certain objects are construed and are evocative of certain thoughts and reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tsang|1998|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no one common property of sublime objects, no one single emotional state in sublime experiences, which is an essential feature of the sublime.&lt;ref name="Tsang_14"&gt;{{harvp|Tsang|1998|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the sublime is but a notion in the mind and heart of the person in relation to the object, any object,&lt;ref&gt;Any object, be it a thing, an event, a thought, an action, a situation, or the like. {{harvp|Tsang|1998|p=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which is confronted as sublime.&lt;ref name="Tsang_14"/&gt; However, from the standpoint of an external observer, one is able to distinguish in the experience of the sublime that which presupposes the universality of certain concepts and human characteristics and that which belongs to particular cultural and social forms and varies from culture to culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tsang|1998|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See further explanation of the theory in Alasdair MacIntyre's [https://books.google.com/books?id=coTmxVPKsRcC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=the+sublime+foreword&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lOACk6Lbft&amp;sig=yg10udFuZyq0NJjeF56jdndHNFw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2l8tUL30CcW0iQeX44G4Dw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20sublime%20foreword&amp;f=false.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6535">In [[philosophy]], the '''unity of the proposition''' is the problem of explaining how a sentence in the [[indicative mood]] expresses more than just what a list of [[proper name]]s expresses.

== History ==

The problem was discussed under this name by [[Bertrand Russell]], but can be traced back to [[Plato]]. In Plato's ''[[Sophist_(dialogue)|Sophist]]'', the simplest kind of sentence consists of just a proper name and a [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[terminology|term]] (i.e. a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]). The name refers to or picks out some [[individual]] [[object (philosophy)|object]], and the predicate then says something about that individual.

The difficulty is to explain how the predicate does this.  If, as Plato thinks, the predicate is the name of some universal [[concept]] or [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/ form], how do we explain how the sentence comes to be [[Truth|true]] or false?  If, for example, "[[Socrates]] is wise" consists of just a name for Socrates, and a name for the universal concept of [[Wisdom]], how could the sentence be true ''or'' false?  In either case, the "Socrates" [[Sign (linguistics)|signifies]] Socrates, and the predicate signifies Wisdom.  But the sentence ''[[Logical assertion|asserts]]'' that Socrates is wise.  The assertion of wisdom must consist in the assertion of some relation between Socrates and Wisdom.  What is this relation?

The problem was discussed much later by [[F. H. Bradley|Francis Bradley]].  If we assume that a sentence consists of two objects and a relation that connects them, and we represent this by three names, say John, loving, Mary, how do we express the fact that John loves Mary?  For "John", "loving" and "Mary" would name the objects they do, even if this were not a fact.  This is known as [[Bradley's regress]].

== Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein ==

The problem became significant in the early development of [[set theory]].  Set membership is a [[Formal set theory|formal]] [[Knowledge representation|representation]] of the relation between the two parts of the proposition, and there are certain philosophical problems connected with this, as [[Frege]] realised when he investigated the distinction between [[concept and object]].  Assume that "Shergar is a horse" analyses into what "Shergar" names (an "Object", according to Frege), and what "is a horse" names (a "Concept").  Objects are fundamentally different from concepts, otherwise we get the problem of the unity of the proposition.  A predicate cannot function as the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a sentence.  But what are we doing when we talk about the concept ''is a horse''? Aren't we using the expression "the concept ''is a horse''", and isn't that a subject expression, which refers (on Frege's account) to an Object? Yes, says Frege, and on that account the concept ''is a horse'' is not a concept at all. This is a [[dogma]] that even Frege's most faithful followers found difficult to swallow.

The difficulty was discussed in detail in ''[[Principia Mathematica|The Principles of Mathematics]]'' by Russell, who saw no resolution.

:There appears to be an ultimate notion of assertion, given by the verb, which is lost as soon as we substitute a verbal noun, and is lost when the proposition in question is made the subject of some other proposition. ...Thus the contradiction which was to have been avoided, of an entity which cannot be made a logical subject, appears to have here become inevitable.  This difficulty, which seems to be inherent in the very nature of truth and falsehood, is one with which I do not know how to deal with satisfactorily.  ...I therefore leave this question to the [[logic]]ians with the above brief indication of a difficulty. (§ 52)

Consider e.g. "A differs from B".  The constituents of this proposition are simply A, difference and B.  The proposition relates A and B, using the words "is ... from" in "A is different from B".  But if we represent this contribution by words for relations, as e.g. "A &lt;R&gt; difference &lt;R&gt; B" we are back to a list of terms, we are essentially back at Bradley's regress.
	
: A proposition, in fact, is essentially a ''unity'', and when analysis has destroyed the unity, no enumeration of constituents will restore the proposition. The verb, when used as a verb, embodies the unity of the proposition, and is thus distinguishable from the verb considered as a term, though I do not know how to give a clear account of the distinction. (§ 52)

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] addresses the problem early on in the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.  In section 2.01 he claims that "states of affairs" are combinations of objects. In section 2.03 he explains that nothing is needed to link the objects, since the objects ''hang together''.  The arrangement of words that in the sentence corresponds to the arrangement or ''structure'' of objects in the [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] expressed by the sentence. This is the so-called [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#The picture theory|picture theory of the proposition]].

The American [[integral (philosophy)|integral]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Ken Wilber]] uses the term  '''worldcentric''' to describe an advanced stage of [[ethics|ethical]] development. This involves a broadening of the spiritual horizon through the formulation of a transpersonal ethic in which we do not only desire the best for all people but for all living beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion|last=Visser|first=Frank|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2003|isbn=0791458156|location=New York|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this aspect where worldcentrism is viewed as an expansion of [[sociocentrism]] where one focuses beyond self-needs to also extend care about the group, community, and society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integral Ecology: Uniting Multiple Perspectives on the Natural World|last=Esbjorn-Hargens|first=Sean|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Michael|publisher=Shambhala Publications|year=2011|isbn=9780834824461|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that worldcentrism situates the positive aspects of [[egocentrism]] and sociocentrism in a larger context of concern so that consideration does not only include one's self or one's people but all peoples and all beings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Synonyms of ''worldcentric'' include ''global'' and ''[[planet]]ary''. 

There are also worldcentrists who maintain that living beings engage in autopoiesis (self-making, self-producing, and self-repairing), which renders these beings as ends-in-themselves and of equal ground value, in addition to whatever extrinsic or intrinsic value they possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Igniting Brilliance: Integral Education for the 21st Century|last=Dea|first=Willow|publisher=Integral Publishers LLC|year=2010|isbn=9781450722247|location=Tucson, AZ|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilber also sometimes refers to an ethical stage that is beyond the worldcentric, which he calls ''kosmocentric''. In a ''kosmocentric'' awareness, one experiences a release of attachments of the gross realm and a radical recognition of evolutionary processes so that an individual is compassionately called to action and becomes capable of letting the gravity of outcomes go.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wilber used to associate these advanced ethical stages with [[mysticism|mystical]] states, but since 2002 he has associated these advanced ethical stages with the development of complexity in the self-related lines of identity, studied by Susanne Cook-Greuter. (See "Integral Spirituality," Ken Wilber;  See also "Transcendence and Mature Thought in Adulthood," Susanne Cook-Greuter.)

'''İbrahim Hakkı Erzurumi''' (18 May 1703 - 22 June 1780), a popular [[sufi]] [[saint]] of [[Turkey]] from [[Erzurum]] in eastern [[Anatolia]] - [[mysticism|mystic]], [[poet]], [[author]], [[astronomer]], [[physicist]], [[psychologist]], [[sociologist]] and [[Islamic scholar]]. He was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Sufi]] philosopher&lt;ref&gt;Bayman, Henry (2001) ''The Station of No Station: Open Secrets of the Sufis'' North Atlantic Books, Berkeley, CA; {{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[encyclopedist]].  

==Life and Works==
{{Sufism}}
Having lost his mother and later his father at an early age, İbrahim Hakkı was raised by his uncle who educated him for a while. He met the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Mahmut I]] at [[Constantinople]] in 1747. He returned to Erzurum, and was continuously interested in religious and scientific matters. Having written fifteen books in the Manzum and regular styles, and a great number of Turkish, Arabic, and Persian amongst İbrahim Hakkı's most important works are the ''Divan'' and ''Marifetname''.

==Theology==
Core to Erzurumi's philosophy is that self-examination is absolutely necessary as part of the process of discovery of Allah: ''"Allah has revealed in His Divine Books, and has sent His prophets as guides to help lead us back to heedfulness. Only those who are able to wake up and rediscover that which is holy within themselves, can come close to our Creator, which is perfection."'' He is widely quoted for saying, "If we take a step towards Allah, He will come running to meet us."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crescentlife.com/spirituality/seven_levels.htm ''Seven Levels of Being'' by Shaikh [[Tosun Bayrak|Tosun Bayrak al-Jerrahi]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821112812/http://www.crescentlife.com/spirituality/seven_levels.htm |date=21 August 2006 }};&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islam4schools.com/Being%20Muslim.htm ''Being Muslim'' Hassan]&lt;/ref&gt;  Which is derived from a [[Hadith Qudsi|hadith qudsi]].&lt;ref&gt;Hadith Qudsi 15. On the authority of Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: Allah the Almighty said: "I am as My servant thinks I am. I am with him when he makes mention of Me. If he makes mention of Me to himself, I make mention of him to Myself; and if he makes mention of Me in an assembly, I make mention of him in an assembly better than it. And if he draws near to Me an arm's length, I draw near to him a fathom's length. And if he comes to Me walking, I go to him at speed." It was related by [[Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari|al-Bukhari]] (also by Muslim, at-Tirmidhi and Ibn-Majah). [http://sacredhadith.com/hadith-qudsi-15/ "Forty Hadith Qudsi" Sacred Hadith]&lt;/ref&gt;
