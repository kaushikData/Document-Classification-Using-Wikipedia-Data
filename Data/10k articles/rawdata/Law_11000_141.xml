'''A v Bottrill''' [2002] UKPC 44 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the awarding of exemplary damages.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |isbn=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Dr Bottrill was a [[pathologist]] in [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]]. Due to his negligence, he misread A's slides for cervical cancer, resulting in her delaying her treatment.

Barred by [[Accident Compensation Corporation|ACC]] law from pursuing Bottrill in court for ordinary damages for her suffering, A instead sued him for exemplary damages, which is a far higher standard to meet.

Her High Court claim in 1999 was dismissed, as well as her subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal.

==Decision==

The Privy Council upheld her appeal, and referred the matter back to court. The appeal was helped by new evidence of Dr Bottrill's negligence.

Footnote: Subsequent to her 1999 claim being dismissed, it was discovered that Bottrill had misread numerous other people's slides, causing a national uproar, resulting in a Commission of Inquiry.

{{Politics}}
The term '''administration''', as used in the context of government, differs according to [[jurisdiction]].
==United States==&lt;!-- This section is linked from Government --&gt;

In [[Americans|American]] usage, the term generally refers to the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] under a specific [[President of the United States|president]] (or [[Governor#United States|governor]], [[Mayor#United States|mayor]], or other local executive);  or the term of a particular executive; for example: "President Y's administration" or "Secretary of Defense X during President Y's administration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/administration administration noun – definition in American English Dictionary – Cambridge Dictionary Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also mean an executive branch agency headed by an administrator, as the [[Small Business Administration]] or the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].

The term "administration" has been used to denote the executive branch in [[presidential system]]s of government.

==Europe==
The term's usage in [[Europe]] varies by country, but most typically the word "administration" refers to [[management | managerial functions]] in general, which may include local governments, or the hierarchy of national and local government, that applies to a town or district. More specifically, it may refer to [[public administration]], the business of administering [[Policy|public policy]] as determined by government. However, outside France and Romania, this usage of the word is uncommon.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

For the British sense{{which?|date=January 2018}} of the word, most countries (be they [[English language|English-speaking]] or not) use the term ''government'', referring to the "administration" of [[Winston Churchill]] as the "Churchill government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/government_1 government noun (GROUP) – definition in British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus – Cambridge Dictionary Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true of the non-European members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].  An older, chiefly [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] usage, is the term [[Ministry (collective executive)| "ministry"]], as in "Churchill Ministry", which is still in official and academic use in Britain, Australia and Canada to refer the terms of [[prime ministers]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ministry Ministry – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the type of government, the word [[coalition]] may be used for a specific government. In the Netherlands, cabinet is the most-used term (as in "the [[fourth Balkenende cabinet]]"), although "coalition" or "government" are also used when one does not refer to a specific coalition (note that the two terms have slightly different meanings).

[[File:47148121 73274e8f1a.jpg|thumb|300px|Horse tripping is a controversial [[charreada]] event banned in nine US states.&lt;ref name=hardsell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=12386|title=Horse Tripping Ban a Tough Sell in Some States|work=TheHorse.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''welfare of animals in rodeo''' has been a topic of discussion for the industry, the public, and the law for decades.  Protests were first raised in the 1870s, and, in the middle twentieth century, laws were enacted to curb events using animals.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436"&gt;[[#Westermeier|Westermeier]]: 436&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) has worked with the rodeo industry (specifically, the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|PRCA]]) to establish rules improving [[animal welfare]] in rodeo and the treatment of rodeo animals.

Today, animal cruelty complaints in rodeo are still very much alive.  The PRCA (which governs about a third of the rodeos conducted in the United States annually) has provided rules for its members regarding [[animal welfare]].  However the concept of rodeo has changed from year to year, derving from the amount of people not in the event increasing. Some local rodeos have banned the use of certain rodeo tack including [[flank strap]]s and certain events such as [[steer tripping]].  Some ''[[charreada]]'' events staged in the United States saw a crack down in the early years of the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;[[#Brown|Brown]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
James Serpell stated in his ''In the Company of Animals'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps exaggerated to claim, as one author has, that the rodeo is 'the modern equivalent of the public hanging'. Nevertheless, these performances hinge on the violent subjugation of living animals, some of which are deliberately incited to frenzied violence by raking them with spurs, constricting the genital region with leather straps, or by thrusting an electric prod into the rectal area. At the same time they are often given bogus, malevolent names in order to deflect sympathy from their plight. Occasionally, they are maimed or killed, and many are forced to undergo the same terrifying ordeal several times a day. Yet the rodeo is presented to the American public as a harmless, red-blooded entertainment in which the cowboy – the epitome of wholesome, manly virtue – uses his courage and skill to overcome and subdue untamable, outlaw stock. Doubtless, the Romans employed similar fantasies to justify their activities in the [[Circus Maximus]].&lt;ref name="Serpell: 225"&gt;[[#Serpell|Serpell]]: 225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Protests were first raised regarding animal welfare in the 1870s, and, beginning in the 1930s, some states enacted laws curtailing rodeo activities and other events involving animals.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436" /&gt;  In the 1950s, the then Rodeo Cowboys Association worked with the [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) to establish regulations protecting the welfare of rodeo animals that were acceptable to both organizations. These regulations appear in the PRCA's annually-updated rule book. Rodeo saw its greatest growth in the 1970s and with it a rise in animal cruelty complaints.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436" /&gt;  The PRCA and AHA have insinuated that these charges exist solely for the fund-raising purposes of other humane interest groups.  The protests and complaints have made the PRCA realize that public education regarding rodeo and the welfare of animals needs to be undertaken if rodeo is to survive.&lt;ref name="Westermeier: 436" /&gt;

In his "Author's Note" to ''Chasing the Rodeo'' (2005, 2006) author W.K. Stratton states, "Without question, rodeo exploits animals for the entertainment of humans, causing injury and death to hundreds of horses and cattle each year." Stratton notes that as many as a dozen head of steer and calves will die annually at a single large rodeo like the [[Calgary Stampede]], and that many valuable roping horses have died over the years at the [[Pendleton Roundup]] which is conducted on slippery grass. He also points out that while PETA ([[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]) characterizes rodeo as "cruelty for a buck", conservative [[Matthew Scully]], a special assistant to and former speechwriter for President [[George W. Bush]] as well as author of ''[[Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy]]'' calls rodeo "gratuitous abuse of animals".  Stratton notes that he attended twenty plus rodeos and bullriding events in researching his book and saw "animals injured in the arena, some badly enough that they had to be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stratton|Stratton]]: 300&amp;ndash;302&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent assessments==
Modern rodeos in the United States are closely regulated and have responded to accusations of [[animal cruelty]] by instituting a number of rules to guide how rodeo animals are to be managed.&lt;ref name=PRCApdf&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080411122325/http://www.prorodeo.com/pdfs/AnimalWelfare.pdf ''Animal Welfare: The Care and Treatment of Professional Rodeo Livestock.'' PRCA {{dead link|date=May 2016}}] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by on-site independent veterinarians.  Reviewing  animal runs, the injury rate was documented 0.047% (16 animals in 33,991 runs.&lt;ref name="Sellnow2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=3233|author=Sellnow, L.|date=January 1, 2002|title=Rodeo horses|publisher=The Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a survey conducted by independent veterinarians at 57 PRCA rodeos found 0.053% (38 animal injuries in 71,743 animal exposures).&lt;ref name="Schonholtz2012"&gt;{{cite web|author=Schonholtz, C.|title=Professional rodeo horses are bred to buck |date=January 16, 2012|url=http://www.naiaonline.org/articles/article/professional-rodeo-horses-are-bred-to-buck#sthash.4WAHrlNx.dpbs|accessdate=May 28, 2012|publisher=National Animal Interest Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 survey reported an injury rate of 0.056% in 21 PRCA rodeos (15 animals in 26,584 performances).&lt;ref name="AVMA2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author=AVMA|title=Welfare of animals integral part of professional rodeos|date=January 15, 2001|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later PRCA survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of "slack" (competitions outside of the main competition events) indicated 27 animals were injured, i.e. 0.04%&lt;ref name="PRCApdf"/&gt;

In Australian rodeos, similar injury rates occur.  Basic injuries occur at a rate of 0.072% (one in 1,405), with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036% (one injury each 2,810 times an animal is used in competition).&lt;ref name="Australian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animals in rodeo|publisher=Australian Professional Rodeo Association|author=Welfare of animals integral part of professional rodeos|accessdate=May 28, 2016|url=http://www.prorodeo.com.au/files/uploaded/file/animalwelfare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of cruelty in US rodeos persist.   The PRCA acknowledges they sanction only about 30% of all rodeos, another 50% are sanctioned by other organizations and 20% are completely unsanctioned.&lt;ref name=PRCApdf/&gt; Several [[animal rights]] and animal welfare organizations keep records of accidents and incidents of possible animal abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharkonline.org/abuseinherent.mv SHARK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110002548/http://www.sharkonline.org/abuseinherent.mv |date=2011-11-10 }}''Animal Abuse Inherent in Rodeo''. Retrieved 6 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite various specific incidents of injury to support their statements,&lt;ref&gt;Renate Robey, "Horse Euthanized After Show Accident," Denver Post 16 January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and also point to examples of long-term breakdown,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Lipsher, "Veterinarian Calls Rodeos Brutal to Stock," Denver Post 20 January 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as reporting on injuries and deaths suffered by animals in non-rodeo events staged on the periphery of professional rodeo such as [[Chuckwagon racing|chuck wagon races]] and "Suicide Runs."{{clarify|What does this term mean?|date=May 2016}}  In terms of statistics on animal injury rate during rodeos, there appear to be no independent studies more recent than the 1994 study.

Groups such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) note incidents of animal injury, including an incident where a "bull [sic] suffered from a broken neck ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/issues/Animals-in-Entertainment/rodeo-cruelty-for-a-buck.aspx ''Rodeo: Cruelty for a Buck'']. Retrieved 23 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), practice sessions are often the scene of more severe animal welfare abuses than competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pp_en_rodeo ASPCA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123072049/http://www.aspca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=pp_en_rodeo |date=2008-11-23 }} "Animals in Entertainment: 5.4 Rodeo" 27 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toronto Medical Officer===
In 1990, when a major rodeo was planned for the [[Toronto]] [[Sky Dome]], [[Ontario, Canada]], the Toronto City Council requested the Toronto Medical Officer on Health to report on rodeo practices and whether "such practices could be deemed cruel to animals". The Medical Officer noted that animal handlers employed electric prods, flank straps, sharpened sticks, spurs and other tack were used to provoke animals into reacting in such a way as to make certain events thrilling for spectators, and thus it was unlikely to be enjoyable for livestock.&lt;ref name="Armstrong: 489"&gt;[[#Armstrong|Armstrong]]: 489&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medical Officer further noted that guidelines instituted to prevent animal abuse at sanctioned rodeos were paid little heed and calves suffered damage not readily visible such as bruised tracheal cartilage in roping events.  All bucking events were found by the Medical Officer to rely on the application of irritants to make the animals "fly" from the chutes.  The Medical Officer stated in his summary that in terms of a dictionary definition of cruelty, most rodeo events have the potential to cause injury, grief, or pain, and therefore can be considered cruel.  Although the Medical Officer did not say that the legal definition of cruelty had been met, he implied that it had been "reached, if not crossed."{{clarify|Is this a quote? If so, it is "stated, not implied"|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref name="Armstrong: 489"/&gt;

===Veterinarians===
E.J. Finocchio, DVM wrote the Rhode Island legislature urging a ban on calf roping: "As a large animal veterinarian for 20 years ... I have witnessed first hand the instant death of calves after their spinal cords were severed from the abrupt stop at the end of a rope when traveling up to 30 mph. I have also witnessed and tended calves who became paralyzed ... and whose tracheas were totally or partially severed ... Slamming to the ground has caused rupture of several internal organs leading to a slow, agonizing death for some of these calves."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Regan|Regan]]: 152&lt;/ref&gt;

C.J. Haber, a veterinarian with 30 years experience as a [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) meat inspector notes, "The rodeo folk send their animals to the packing house where ... I have seen cattle so extensively bruised that the only areas where the skin was attached [to the body] was the head, neck, legs, and belly. I have seen animals with six to eight ribs broken from the spine and at times puncturing the lungs."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Regan|Regan]]: 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions of animal groups==
[[File:Calf Roping Rodeo.JPG|thumb|A steer after being roped.]]

===The Calgary Humane Society (CHS)===
"The Calgary Humane Society opposes the use of animals for any form of entertainment in which they are placed at risk of suffering undue stress, pain, injury or death."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Statement|CHS]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Given its position on animals in entertainment, CHS opposes rodeo events like chuckwagon racing, calf-roping and steer wrestling that are the most often implicated in injury to animals.

While other organizations may wish to intervene through protest, or other means, CHS has found it can best protect the interests of the animals involved by working with organizations that put on such events.  Over more than a decade of work with the Calgary Stampede, Calgary Humane Society has been instrumental in significant changes that have reduced injuries (for example, changes to the chuckwagon track that reduced stress fractures to the legs of horses; penalizing of calf-roping that yanked the calf backward) and eliminated certain high risk events (like wild cow milking).

CHS does its work by providing recommendations to the organizations, by following up on public complaints, and by having its Peace Officers attending these events to ensure the province's Animal Protection Act (APA) is upheld.

Under Alberta and Canadian law, Calgary Humane Society's primary role in attendance of the Calgary Stampede is to enforce the Animal Protection Act of Alberta.Calgary Humane Society Peace Officers attend every day of the Stampede to monitor and ensure the animals are being properly treated i.e., food, water, shelter and care. They are also immediately on scene of any accident involving an animal  to ensure the animal is being treated promptly, efficiently and humanely, to document what happened, and to follow up with the unresolved cases.

CHS encourages concerned citizens to document their complaints and send them to the agencies and individuals listed in the attached document.

===The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS)===
[[The Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) takes a position of opposition to all rodeos and rodeo events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The HSUS opposes rodeos as they are commonly organized, since they typically cause torment and stress to animals; expose them to pain, injury, or even death; and encourage an insensitivity to and acceptance of the inhumane treatment of animals in the name of sport. Accordingly, we oppose the use of devices such as electric prods, sharpened sticks, spurs, flank straps, and other rodeo equipment that cause animals to react violently, and we oppose bull riding, bronco riding, steer roping, calf roping, "wild horse racing," chuck wagon racing, steer tailing, and horse tripping.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Statement|HSUS]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Humane Society of the United States came into being in 1954 as an offshoot of the American Humane Association (AHA), and initially tackled legislation regarding humane slaughter, the protection of laboratory animals and other issues. In the 1970s, the organization began eyeing rodeo and its "psychologically damaging" effect on children.

===The Vancouver Humane Society===
"Vancouver Humane Society is opposed to rodeo because most rodeo events involve the use of fear, stress or pain to make animals perform."  In Canada, the City of Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver have banned rodeos. For the most part, all animal welfare organizations in Canada oppose rodeo, including the Humane Society of Canada and the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies.&lt;ref name="VHS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouverhumanesociety.bc.ca/issues/animals_in_entertainment/rodeo |title=Rodeo: animal abuse for the sake of entertainment |work=Vancouver Humane Society|accessdate=April 1, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090318120749/http://www.vancouverhumanesociety.bc.ca/issues/animals_in_entertainment/rodeo| archivedate= 18 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HSC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=277&amp;Itemid=169 |title=Rodeos A Brutal Violent Spectacle Says The HSC |work=The Humane Society of Canada|accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)===
PETA criticizes the United States military in its annual expenditure of tax dollars to support the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR), stating that American tax dollars are fueling "horrific and cruel rodeo events".  PETA asserts that rodeo animals suffer fear and pain through the application of spurs, flank straps, prods, and tail-twisting.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aguilar|Aguilar]]: 157&lt;/ref&gt;

PETA has used some unorthodox methods to make its point. Moments after being crowned, [[Miss Rodeo America]] 2000 had a chocolate [[tofu]] 'cow pie' pushed in her face by a PETA member. PETA President, [[Ingrid Newkirk]], said in a statement that Miss Rodeo America should relinquish her crown for promoting cruelty to animals. "Now that she's got pie on her face, we hope Miss Rodeo America will find a little compassion in her heart," Newkirk said. The pageant is held in conjunction with the [[National Finals Rodeo]], an event PETA annually protests against, claiming the sport exploits animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Associated Press|AP]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA)===
The [[ASPCA]] has a policy statement on rodeo events that reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ASPCA is opposed to all rodeo events that involve cruel, painful, stressful and potentially harmful treatment of livestock, not only in performance but also in handling, transport and prodding to perform. The ASPCA recognizes the cruel treatment inflicted on many additional animals in the process of practicing to compete in rodeo events. Further, the ASPCA is opposed to children's rodeo events such as goat tying, calf riding and sheep riding ("mutton busting"), which do not promote humane care and respect for animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ASPCA|ASPCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The American Humane Association (AHA)===
The [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) used to campaign against rodeo through anti-rodeo literature but changed its strategy in the 1950s and began working with rodeo to establish rules to ensure the humane treatment of livestock.  The rules are updated as needed and published annually in the PRCA's rule book.  The AHA believes the exploitation of animals begins when "animals, people, and money" are mixed together, and what progress has been made is ascribed to a change in people's attitudes in general and the urban and college background of modern rodeo participants. Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has criticized the AHA for collaborating with rodeo and thereby lending respectability to its cruelties.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fredricksson|Fredricksson]]: 169&lt;/ref&gt;  The AHA has strict requirements for the treatment and use of animals in movie rodeo scenes. The use of electric prods and other artificial stimuli to make an animal perform are forbidden, for example.&lt;ref&gt;[[#American Humane Association|AHA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Australia (RSPCA Australia)===
The [[RSPCA Australia]] is opposed to rodeo. It has repeatedly called for rodeo to be banned,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rspcavic.org/campaigns_news/images/Media%20Releases/2008_03_Rodeo%20Ban.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21424365-2862,00.html | work=Herald Sun | title=RSPCA backs rodeo ban | first=Ian | last=Royall | date=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2009/01/08/48651_tasmania-news.html RSPCA moves on rodeos Tasmania News - The Mercury - The Voice of Tasmania&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  and has funded media campaigns urging public boycott of prominent international rodeos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rspcavic.org/campaigns_news/images/Media%20Releases/2008_04_stamp_out_rodeos.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Its policy statement reads:

{{quote|RSPCA Australia is opposed to rodeos because of the potential for significant injury, suffering or distress to the animals involved. The use of devices such as flank straps, spurs and electric prods contributes to the pain and suffering associated with this sport.

Where rodeos are permitted to be conducted, RSPCA Australia advocates the adoption of compulsory registration and licensing. Compliance with national standards for the management, housing and transport of rodeo animals must be made a condition of licensing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kb.rspca.org.au/RSPCA-Policy-C07-Rodeos_178.html RSPCA Policy C07 Rodeos], ''RSPCA Australia'', accessed February 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Responses==

===Rodeo===
The PRCA admits it only oversees about a third of the actual rodeos that occur in the United States annually, and, according to their own public relations information, the organization has taken steps to improve the welfare of animals. The organization says that most rodeo animals enjoy what they're doing.&lt;ref&gt;name="Serpell: 225"&lt;/ref&gt;  The PRCA's regulations and rules require, among other things, provisions for injured animals, [[veterinarian]]s on site at PRCA sanctioned rodeos, and [[spur]]s with dulled, free-spinning rowels.  Health regulations mandate vaccinations and blood testing of animals crossing state lines, and sick or injured animals are given appropriate veterinary care.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|PRCA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published by the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] (AVMA) in its Journal dated January 2001, Dr. James Furman, a former rodeo rider and mixed practice practitioner, stated at the organization's Animal Welfare Forum that ranchers provide their stock health and other care. When grilled about the possible damage to a calf's neck when he is roped and jerked to a sudden stop, Dr. Furman responded by observing that rodeo men have changed calf roping techniques; where they once roped and flipped a calf on its back they now try to spin the standing calf around.

''[[Charreada]]'' is amateur rodeo among Mexican Americans in the United States with family-owned arenas being operated for 200 teams in 12 states.  Eight states have cracked down on several traditional events including horse-tripping, an event in which the front legs of a running mare are roped causing her to fall, and steer tailing in which a steer is flipped to the earth by grabbing his tail. Some Mexican Americans have expressed concerns their culture is being unfairly targeted and point to the deaths of [[Eight Belles]] and other race horses as evidence that Anglo sports involving animals see few restrictions.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

Rodeo sometimes appears in court. A PRCA [[stock contractor]] faced animal cruelty charges regarding the use of a prod at a California rodeo in 2002. Testimony revealed a rodeo judge and a veterinarian had been consulted before the rodeo about a chute-stalling horse, and an agreement had been reached that if the horse stalled, the prod would be applied to protect all involved. California law stipulates a prod cannot be used on an animal in a holding chute unless necessary to protect participants and spectators.  The stock contractor was cleared of charges because the chute gate was open when the prod was used, and therefore it was not a holding chute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schonholtz|Schonholtz]]: Animal&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
In response to animal welfare and animal cruelty concerns, a number of laws have passed regulating rodeo. In the United Kingdom the [[Protection of Animals Act 1934]] effectively made rodeo, as it was then practiced, illegal in England, Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Garner Robert (1993) ''Animals, Politics and Morality'' Manchester, UK, Manchester University Press, p.88, {{ISBN|0-7190-3574-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2000, California became the first American state to prohibit the use of prods on any animal in a chute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]]: 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Stringent regulations have virtually eliminated rodeo in [[Rhode Island]], a state which also stipulates that any individual convicted of animal cruelty in a rodeo cannot participate as a rodeo contestant.  While there is no record in any state of anyone being convicted of cruelty to animals during the course of a rodeo, several states&amp;mdash;[[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Oregon]], [[Utah]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Wyoming]]&amp;mdash;all exempt rodeo from its anticruelty laws, making such convictions impossible. Eleven of the states immunize rodeo events from the provisions of the law, while Utah excludes rodeo animals from the definition of 'animal' in its anitcruelty laws. [[Idaho]] has declared exhibitions that are commonly considered acceptable cannot be charged with cruelty to animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnett|Curnett]]: 272&lt;/ref&gt;

After a video aired on [[NBC]] showing a bull breaking its leg in a 1991 [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] rodeo, the city banned controversial rodeo tack, specifically electric prods or shocking devices, flank or bucking straps, wire tie-downs, and sharpened or fixed spurs or rowels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]] 272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#People for the Ethical Treatment of AnimalsETA|PETA]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Pittsburgh also requires humane officers be provided access to any and all areas where animals may go&amp;ndash;specifically pens, chutes, and injury pens.&lt;ref&gt;[[#People for teh Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] does not allow anyone to conduct a rodeo within the city limits.&lt;ref&gt;[[#PETA|PETA]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Woodstock, Illinois]] made fighting or wrestling with any animal illegal, thus ending [[steer wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]]: 273&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ohio]] has restricted some rodeo practices, having outlawed unpadded flank and bucking straps and the use of electric prods on cattle and horses.    Rodeo was banned in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1934 when Parliament passed the Protection of Animals Act. [[Baltimore, Maryland]], [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]], and [[Pompano Beach, Florida]] have enacted legislation banning certain rodeo tack including [[bullwhip]]s.  [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] has banned rodeo within the city limits&amp;mdash;the only complete ban on rodeo in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curnutt|Curnutt]]: 272&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art equity''' is a proportionate [[ownership]] right that an individual or entity may claim against a physical representation of [[Art]]. Art Equity is distributed through organizations like the [[International art exchange]].

Art equity has many [[legal rights]] and any ownership stake is transferable pending the owner's permission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13296">'''Civil liberties in the United States''' are certain unalienable rights retained by (as opposed to privileges granted to) citizens of the United States under the [[Constitution of the United States]], as interpreted and clarified by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and lower federal courts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ontheissues.org/askme/civil_liberties.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil liberties]] are simply defined as individual legal and constitutional protections from entities more powerful than an individual, for example, parts of the government, other individuals, or corporations. The liberties explicitly defined, make up the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], including freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, and the [[right to privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://public.findlaw.com/civil-rights/civil-rights-basics/civil-rights-vs-liberties.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many liberties of people not defined in the Constitution, as stated in the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]]: ''The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.'' 

The extent of civil liberties and the periphery of the population of the United States who had access to these liberties has expanded over time. For example, the Constitution did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to determine who was eligible. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only [[White American|white]] male adult property owners to vote (about 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495904991|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&amp;pg=PT337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Kenneth|last1=Janda|first2=Jeffrey M.|last2=Berry|first3=Jerry|last3=Goldman|title=The challenge of democracy: government in America|date=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=9780618990948|page=207|edition=9. ed., update|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQ_iZMofnl0C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '[[Three-Fifths Compromise]]' allowed the southern slaveholders to consolidate power and maintain slavery in America for eighty years after the ratification of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;"We Hold These Truths to be Self-evident;" An Interdisciplinary Analysis of the Roots of Racism &amp; slavery in America Kenneth N.

====Free speech exceptions====

{{Main|United States free speech exceptions}}

[[United States free speech exceptions|The following types of speech are not protected constitutionally]]: defamation or false statements, child pornography, obscenity, damaging the national security interests, verbal acts, and fighting words. Because these categories fall outside of the First Amendment privileges, the courts can legally restrict or criminalize any expressive act within them. Other expressions, including threat of bodily harm or publicizing illegal activity, may also be ruled illegal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstamendment.com/firstamendment.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual freedom===
The concept of sexual freedom includes a broad range of different rights that are not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. The idea of sexual freedom has sprung more from the popular opinion of society in more recent years, and has had very little Constitutional backing. The following liberties are included under sexual freedom: sexual expression, sexual choices, sexual education, reproductive justice, and sexual health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glaa.org/archive/2010/woodhullreport1019.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual freedom in general is considered an implied procedure, and is not mentioned in the Constitution.  

Sexual freedoms include the freedom to have consensual sex with whomever a person chooses, at any time, for any reason, provided the person is of the age of majority. Marriage is not required, nor are there any requirements as to the gender or number of people you have sex with. Sexual freedom includes the freedom to have private consensual homosexual sex (''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'').

===Equal protection===

Equal protection prevents the government from creating laws that are discriminatory in application or effect.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2013}}
A '''closing argument''', '''summation''', or '''summing up''' is the concluding statement of each party's [[counsel]] reiterating the important [[Logical argument|arguments]] for the [[trier of fact]], often the jury, in a [[court case]]. A closing argument occurs after the presentation of [[evidence (law)|evidence]]. A closing argument may not contain any new information and may only use [[evidence (law)|evidence]] introduced at trial.  It is not customary to raise [[objection (law)|objection]]s during closing arguments, except for egregious behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cjm_38.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  However, such objections, when made, can prove critical later in order to preserve appellate issues.

In the United States, the [[plaintiff]] is generally entitled to open the argument. The [[defendant]] usually goes second. The plaintiff or prosecution is usually then permitted a final rebuttal argument.  In some jurisdictions, however, this form is condensed, and the prosecution or plaintiff goes second, after the defense, with no rebuttals.  Either party may [[waive]] their opportunity to present a closing argument.

During closing arguments, counsel may not (among other restrictions) vouch for the credibility of witnesses, indicate their personal opinions of the case, comment on the absence of evidence that they themselves have caused to be excluded, or attempt to exhort the jury to irrational, emotional behavior.

In some countries (e.g. France or Germany), in criminal cases, the defendant's counsel always makes his closing argument last, after the public prosecutor or any other party. Sometimes the defendant is allowed to address the court directly after his or her counsel's closing argument.

In a [[criminal law]] case, the [[prosecution]] will restate all the evidence which helps prove each [[wiktionary:element|element]] of the offence. In the USA, there are often several limits as to what the prosecution may or may not say, including precluding the prosecution from using a defendant's exercise of his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right to silence as evidence of [[guilt (law)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;See Cantrell, Charles L., Prosecutorial Misconduct: Recognizing Errors in Closing Argument, 26 Am. J. Trial Advoc. 535 (2003) http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1035&amp;context=charles_cantrell&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important restrictions on prosecutors, however, is against shifting the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], or implying that the defense must put on evidence or somehow prove the innocence of the defendant.

In some cases, a judge's presentation of the [[jury instruction]] is also known as summing up.  In this case, the judge is merely articulating the law and questions of fact upon which the jury is asked to [[deliberate]].

The purposes and techniques of closing argument are taught in courses on [[Trial Advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lubet, Steven; ''Modern Trial Advocacy'', NITA, New York, NY 2004 pp. 42 et. seq. {{ISBN|1556818866}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The closing is often planned early in the trial planning process.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S.; ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win''; Conatus, Boston, MA, 2012, p. 2; {{ISBN|0615676952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The attorneys will integrate the closing with the overall case strategy through either a theme and theory or, with more advanced strategies, a [[Litigation strategy#Lines of effort|line of effort]]. The prosecution should also state the main points and be sure to give their side of the argument and to be emotional.&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Tom (PhD) &amp; Schmid, Jill (PhD); Tsongas Litigation Consulting. [http://tsongas.com/article-posts/effective-opening-statements-and-closing-arguments/ Effective Opening Statements and Closing Arguments.]''King County Bar Bulletin.'' Dec. 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7385">In the [[law of evidence]], a '''credible [[witness]]''' is a person making [[testimony]] in a [[court]] or other [[tribunal]], or acting otherwise as a witness, whose [[credibility]] is [[witness impeachment|unimpeachable]].  A witness may have more or less credibility, or no credibility at all.  In the [[common law]] system, the term 'credible witness' may be used generally, to refer to testimony, or for the witnessing of certain documents.

Several factors affect witnesses' [[credibility]].  A credible witness is "competent to give evidence, and is worthy of belief."&lt;ref name="lectlaw"&gt;[http://www.lectlaw.com/def/c328.htm 'Lectric Law Library website definition of "credible witness"]. Last accessed October 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, a witness is deemed to be credible if they are recognized (or can be recognized) as a source of reliable information about someone, an event, or a phenomenon.

==Testifying in court==
In a wide variety of cases that use the rules of evidence, [[testimony]] must be given by credible witnesses.

In [[Scottish law]], a credible witness is one "whose credibility commends itself to the presiding magistrate ... the trustworthiness" of whom is good.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Words and Phrases legally defined]],'' Vol. 1, pp. 373-374, citing ''Manson v. Macleod'', 1918 SC(J) 60 at 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English law]], a credible witness is one who is ''not'' "speaking from [[hearsay]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Words and Phrases legally defined,'' Vol. 1, p. 374, citing ''R. v. Noakes'', 1 KB 581 (CCA 1917).&lt;/ref&gt;  In English:
{{quote|Credible seems here to be used in the way that people have employed it ever since it appeared in the English language in the fourteenth century: of something that is convincing or is capable of being believed.

==History==
Contesting the credibility of so-called "expert" witnesses rose into more common practice in the 1860s and 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=ODT18650918.2.23 |title=Law and Police |publisher=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=18 September 1865 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |quote=A strong effort was made to impeach her credibility as a witness... it is competent to prove that the witness is an expert and not a mere pretender.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xWNFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4bsMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4802,3268733 |title=Last Day of the Scandal Trial |publisher=[[Ithaca Democrat]] |date=8 July 1875 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |quote=There was an irreconcilable difference of opinion as to the credibility of witnesses on each side.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Witnessing of wills and documents==
Credible witnesses must be used to give meaning or existence to certain types of documents, such as a [[last will and testament]], [[codicil (will)|codicil]], [[apostille]], [[Deposition (law)|deposition]], [[interrogatories]], certified document, or government record.

For example, in most [[common law jurisdiction]]s, two or three  witnesses must sign their names to the Will at the [[attestation clause]] below the testimonium clause that is executed by the [[testator]].  The exact number of witnesses depend on the state or local law.  Under the English [[Statute of Wills]] of 1540, it was three witnesses.  Under modern [[New York law]], only two witnesses are required.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. EPTL § 3-2.1 (a) (4), found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWSNew York State Assembly government website], go to "EPT" (Estates Powers and Trusts Law), then Article 3, Part 2, and finally § 3-2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Canadian law]], a credible witness to a Will "means a witness not incapacitated by mental inbecility (sic), interest or crime."&lt;ref&gt;''Words and Phrases legally defined,'' Vol. 1, p. 374, citing ''Ryan v. Devereaux'', 26 UCR 100 at 107 (Ont. CA 1866).&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[authentication]] of a document, a credible witness is needed whose major duty is identify, to a [[notary public]], the signer of the document.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notary-92127.com/glossary.html San Diego Notary website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411023541/http://www.notary-92127.com/glossary.html |date=2010-04-11 }}.

{{Insolvency}}
'''Cross-border insolvency''' (sometimes called '''international insolvency''') regulates the treatment of financially distressed debtors where such debtors have assets or creditors in more than one country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency in Private International Law|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|author=Ian Fletcher|edition=2nd|year=2005|isbn=978-0199262502}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, cross-border insolvency is more concerned with the [[insolvency]] of [[corporation|companies]] that operate in more than one country rather than [[bankruptcy]] of individuals.  Like traditional [[conflict of laws]] rules, cross-border insolvency focuses upon three areas: choice of law rules, jurisdiction rules and enforcement of judgment rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=385|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in relation to insolvency, the principal focus tends to be the recognition of foreign insolvency officials and their powers.

==Theories of cross-border insolvency==
There are, broadly, three approaches to the administration of cross-border insolvency:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=386|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The territorial approach''', whereby each country exercises its own domestic insolvency laws in relation to all the debtor's property and all of the creditors located within its jurisdiction.  This approach does not recognise any extraterritorial dimension to insolvency law.
* '''The universalist approach''' (or ''universal approach''), whereby any cross-border insolvencies are administered pursuant to a single global insolvency regime, and all of the debtor's assets are distributed by a single insolvency office holder, regardless where the assets or claimants are located.
* '''Hybrid approach'''.  A number of hybrid approaches exist in theory or practice, including:
** [[Modified universalism]], whereby individual countries seek to identify the most relevant jurisdiction in which to conduct the proceedings, and all other states cooperate with and facilitate such proceedings (subject to limits of [[public policy]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jay Westbrook |date= |title=Global Solution to Multinational Default |url=http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/Insolvency%20Topics/Sovereign%20Insolvencies/18~_Global_Solution_to_Multinational_Default.pdf |journal=[[Michigan Law Review]] |year=2000 |volume=98 |page=2276 |doi=10.2307/1290306 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623122232/http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/Insolvency%20Topics/Sovereign%20Insolvencies/18~_Global_Solution_to_Multinational_Default.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or
** Co-operative territorialism, which is broadly predicated on territorialist approach supplemented by multi-lateral conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lynn LoPucki |date= |title=Cooperation in International Bankruptcy: A Post-Universalist Approach |url=http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/cornell-law-review/upload/Lopucki.pdf |journal=[[Cornell Law Review]] |year=1999 |volume=86 |page=696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universalist approach remains largely a holistic ideal and, for the most part, countries are divided into those with a purely territorial approach, and those that apply some form of hybrid approach.

==Development==

Historically, most legal systems have developed on a territorial basis, and this is as true in relation to bankruptcy laws as other areas.  However, from an early stage there have been piecemeal attempts to develop cross-border cooperation in insolvency matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=387|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In 1889 seven treaties were signed in Montevideo with the aim to harmonising [[private international law]] in the signatory states ([[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Uruguay]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|jstor=742785|title=The Treaties of Montevideo (1889)|author=Wyndham Bewes|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which related to the regulation of bankruptcies between member states.  The treaty was updated in 1930, and broadly provided for a system more closer to territorialism than universality, providing for multiple bankruptcy administrations in different states for multinational companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=f_yWaV_-_l4C&amp;pg=PT946&amp;lpg=PT946&amp;dq=Montevideo+Bankruptcy+Treaty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D-jm4fRiV6&amp;sig=jibUcGANCJ2UJY03tYpmJyVIWFU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CPiIVfrIO4G2-QHt6YO4Dw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Montevideo%20Bankruptcy%20Treaty&amp;f=false|title=Principles of International Insolvency|author=Philip Wood|publisher=[[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]]|location=29-080| year=2007 |isbn=9781847032102 |accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1933 Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden signed into law the [[Nordic Bankruptcy Convention]] which, although not a lengthy document, is still in force today and facilitates administration of cross border bankruptcies in the Scandinavia region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/country%20resources/Norway/Articles/1~_Nordic_Bankruptcy.pdf|title=The Nordic Bankruptcy Convention - An Introduction|author=Carl Hugo Parment|date=|accessdate=23 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623141319/http://test.iiiglobal.org/downloads/country%20resources/Norway/Articles/1~_Nordic_Bankruptcy.pdf|archivedate=23 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1980s the [[International Bar Association]] published a model law, the Model International Insolvency Co-operation Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elizabeth Somers |date= |title=The Model International Insolvency Cooperation Act: An International Proposal for Domestic Legislation |url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1571&amp;context=auilr |journal=[[American University International Law Review]] |year=2011 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately this model was not adopted by any country and the attempt was unsuccessful.

But from a comparatively early stage [[common law]] jurisdictions recognised the desirability of ensuring that insolvency officers from different jurisdictions received the necessary support to enable the efficient administration of estates.  Under English law one of the earliest recorded cases was ''Solomons v Ross'' (1764) 1 H Bl 131n.  In that case a firm in the Netherlands was declared bankrupt and assignees were appointed.  An English creditor had brought [[garnishment|garnishee proceedings]] in England to attach certain sums owing to the Dutch firm but Bathurst J held that the bankruptcy had vested all the firm's assets (including debts owed by English debtors) in the Dutch assignees, and the English creditor had  to surrender the fruits of the garnishee proceedings and prove in the Dutch bankruptcy.  In ''Re African Farms'' 1906 TS 373 an English company with assets in the [[Transvaal Colony]] was in [[winding-up]] in England, and the Chief Justice of the Transvaal confirmed that the English [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] would be recognised and that "recognition which carries with it the active assistance of the court", and that active assistance could include: "A declaration, in effect, that the liquidator is entitled to deal with the Transvaal assets in the same way as if they were within the jurisdiction of the English courts, subject only to such conditions as the court may impose for the protection of local creditors, or in recognition of the requirements of our local laws."  In ''Galbraith v Grimshaw'' [1910] AC 508 [[Andrew Murray, 1st Viscount Dunedin|Lord Dunedin]] stated that there should be only one universal process of the distribution of a bankrupt's property and that, where such a process was pending elsewhere, the English courts should not let actions in its jurisdiction interfere with that process.&lt;ref&gt;"Now so far as the general principle is concerned it is quite consistent with the comity of nations that it should be a rule of international law that if the court finds that there is already pending a process of universal distribution of a bankrupt's effects it should not allow steps to be taken in its territory which would interfere with that process of universal distribution." at 513&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first significant developments in relation to cross-border insolvency regimes which were widely adopted were (1) the UNCITRAL Model Law, and (2) the EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000.

==Modern regimes==

Two current regimes for international insolvencies have been implemented on something wider than a regional basis: the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, and the EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000.&lt;ref&gt;No 1346/2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Both regimes locate the ''centre of main interest'' (or "COMI") of the debtor.

===The UNCITRAL Model Law===
{{Main article|UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency}}
The [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] adopted a model law relating to cross-border insolvency on 30 June 1997.&lt;ref name=uncitral&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/insolvency/1997Model.html|title=UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (1997)|publisher=UNCITRAL|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At present 46 jurisdictions have substantially implemented the Model Law into their domestic legislation, including a number of states with both significant economies and large volumes of cross border trade—such as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, as well as leading emerging economies such as Mexico and [[South Africa]].

The basic concept of the Model Law is to establish what the "main proceedings" are in relation to any international insolvency.  All other proceedings are referred to as the "non-main proceedings".  The main proceedings are commenced where the debtor has its centre of main interest, or "COMI".&lt;ref name=uncitral /&gt;  Non-main proceedings may be commenced in any place where the debtor has a commercial establishment.  The Model Law does not require reciprocity between states, but focuses upon (i) ensuring that states give assistance to insolvency officials from other countries in relation to main proceedings and non-main proceedings, and (ii) eliminating preferences for local creditors over international ones.&lt;ref&gt;Model Law, Article 13, paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The following countries have substantially implemented the Model Law into their domestic legislation.&lt;ref name=Countries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/insolvency/1997Model_status.html|title=Status - UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (1997)|publisher=UNCITRAL|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000===

{{Main article|Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000}}

The [[Regulation (European Union)|EC Regulation]] on Insolvency Proceedings 2000 was passed on 29 May 2000 and came into effect on 31 May 2002.&lt;ref name=ECReg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32000R1346|title=Council regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings|publisher=Eur-Lex|date=|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EC Regulation, as its name applies, operates between member states of the [[European Union]], and focuses upon creating a framework for the commencement of proceedings and for the automatic recognition and co-operation between the different member states.  Unusually for a European regulation, the EC Insolvency Regulation does not seek to harmonise insolvency laws between the different member states.

Like the UNCITRAL Model Law, the EC Regulation also employs the concept of a centre of main interest (or "COMI").  The definition of the COMI is left to member states in their implementation of the Regulation, but paragraph (13) of the preamble states: 'The "centre of main interests" should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.'  If the COMI of an entity is outside of the European Union then the insolvency proceedings are not subject to the Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;''Re the Arena Corporation Ltd'' [2003] EWHC 3032 (Ch.), affirmed on appeal ([2004] EWCA Civ 371).&lt;/ref&gt;  In relation to [[corporation|companies]] there is a [[presumption (law)|presumption]] that the registered office is the COMI of the company, but this presumption can be (and often is) [[rebuttal|rebutted]].&lt;ref&gt;''Re AIM Underwriting Agencies'' [2004] EWHC Civ 2114; ''Re TXU Europe German Finance BV'' [2005] BCC 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EC Regulation does not define insolvency, but it does define insolvency proceedings as "...collective insolvency proceedings which entail the partial or total divestment of a debtor and the appointment of a liquidator."&lt;ref&gt;Article 1(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 3 divides proceedings into main proceedings and territorial proceedings.  Main proceedings are accorded extraterritorial effect throughout the European Union.  One of the concerns expressed in relation to the EC Regulation is that (other than a reference to the [[European Court of Justice]]) it provides no mechanism for determining which set of proceedings are the main proceedings if two or more jurisdictions claim their proceedings are the main proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd'' (Case C-341/04), [2006] ECR 1-701&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Insolvency Law|publisher=Jordans|author=Andrew Keay and Peter Walton|edition=2nd|year=2011|page=400|isbn=978-1846611193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of conflict==

In any attempt to harmonise or facilitate cross-border administration of insolvent companies, national insolvency regimes can take widely divergent approaches on certain key points:

* '''[[Secured creditor]]s.'''  Whether or not bankruptcy proceedings operate as a stay upon the enforcement of secured creditor's rights as a fundamental determinant in relation to the manner of conduct of any proceedings
* '''Corporate rehabilitation regimes.''' Bankruptcy systems predicated on trying to rehabilitate companies (such as [[Chapter 11]] in the United States, or [[administration order]]s in the United Kingdom) are fundamentally different in intent and effect to winding-up regimes that seeks to liquidate companies and distribute the proceeds to creditors.
* '''Set-off rights.''' Whilst certain countries allow creditors who have mutual claims with the debtor to [[set-off (law)|set-off]] those claims in full, others require the creditors to pay any sums owed to the debtor in full before claiming in the proceedings.  Within jurisdictions that do permit set-off, variations may arise as to whether set-off must be on an individual or group basis.&lt;ref&gt;In an insolvent liquidation, banks who provide loan finance are often key creditors. Similarly, most companies also have cash-at-bank as one of their assets.  The ability of banks to set-off those sums can be a material factor.&lt;/ref&gt;

United States|volume=346|page=389|pin=|year=1953}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision of the Court==
Justice [[Tom C. Clark|Clark]] delivered the opinion of the Court. 

The Court ruled that classification as minister is not available to all members of a sect notwithstanding doctrine that all are ministers; but part-time secular work does not, without more, disqualify member from satisfying the ministerial exemption.

'''Dropbox''' is a [[file hosting service]] operated by American company Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in [[San Francisco]], California, that offers [[cloud storage]], [[file synchronization]], [[personal cloud]], and [[Client (computing)|client]] software. Dropbox was founded in 2007 by [[MIT]] students [[Drew Houston]] and [[Arash Ferdowsi]] as a [[startup company]], with initial funding from [[seed accelerator]] [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]].

Dropbox can create a special folder on the user's computer, the contents of which are then synchronized to Dropbox's servers and to other computers and devices that the user has installed Dropbox on, keeping the same files up-to-date on all devices. Dropbox uses a [[freemium]] [[business model]], where users are offered a free account with a set storage size, with paid subscriptions available that offer more capacity and additional features. Dropbox Basic users are given 2&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s of free storage space. Dropbox Plus users are given 1&amp;nbsp;[[terabyte]] of storage space, as well as additional features, including advanced sharing controls, remote wipe, and an optional Extended Version History add-on. Dropbox offers computer apps for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] computers, and mobile apps for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Windows Phone]] smartphones and tablets. In March 2013, the company acquired [[Mailbox (application)|Mailbox]], a popular email app, and in April 2014, the company introduced [[Dropbox Carousel]], a photo and video gallery app. Both Mailbox and Carousel were shut down in December 2015, with key features from both apps implemented into the regular Dropbox service. In October 2015, it officially announced [[Dropbox Paper]], its [[collaborative]] document editor, in a reported effort to expand its operations towards businesses. As of March 2016, Dropbox has 500 million users.&lt;ref&gt; Benjamin Rains, Zacks. "[https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/311337/should-you-buy-dropbox-dbx-stock Should You Buy Dropbox (DBX) Stock?]." July 12, 2018. Retrieved July 16, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;
 
Dropbox has received praise, including the Crunchie Award in 2010 for Best Internet Application, and ''[[Macworld]]''`s 2009 Editor's Choice Award for Software. It has been ranked as one of the most valuable startups in the US and the world, with a valuation of over US$10&amp;nbsp;billion, and it has been described as one of Y Combinator's most successful investments to date. However, Dropbox has also [[Criticism of Dropbox|experienced criticism and generated controversy]] for issues including security breaches and privacy concerns.

Dropbox has a five star [[privacy]] rating from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2017|title=Who Has Your Back? Government Data Requests 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drew Houston (Dropbox) (6478266407).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dropbox founder Drew Houston]]
[[File:Arash Ferdowsi 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dropbox founder Arash Ferdowsi]]
Dropbox founder Drew Houston conceived the Dropbox concept after repeatedly forgetting his [[USB flash drive]] while he was a student at [[MIT]]. In a 2009 "Meet the Team" post on the Dropbox blog, he wrote that existing services at the time "suffered problems with Internet [[latency (engineering)|latency]], large files, [[software bug|bugs]], or just made me think too much". He began making something for his personal use, but then realized that it could benefit others with the same problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Ying |title=Meet the Team! (Part 1) |url=https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2009/02/meet-the-team-part-1/ |website=Dropbox Blog |publisher=Dropbox |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston founded Evenflow, Inc. in May 2007&lt;ref name="dropbox-ipo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1467623/000119312518055809/d451946ds1.htm|title=Form S-1 Registration Statement - Dropbox, Inc.|website=www.sec.gov|access-date=2018-10-22|quote="We were incorporated in May 2007 as Evenflow, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and changed our name to Dropbox, Inc. in October 2009."|date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the company behind Dropbox, and shortly thereafter secured seed funding from [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]].&lt;ref name="Initial funding"&gt;{{cite web |title=June 1, 2007: Dropbox - Funding RoundSeed |url=https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-round/06480ed05bdda6caeb0e365927f9c30b |website=CrunchBase |publisher=''[[TechCrunch]]'' |date=June 1, 2007 |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dropbox officially launched at 2008's [[TechCrunch]] Disrupt, an annual technology conference.&lt;ref name="Domain"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Kincaid |title=Dropbox Acquires The Domain Everyone Thought It Had: Dropbox.com |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/13/dropbox-acquires-the-domain-everyone-thought-it-had-dropbox-com/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to trademark disputes between Proxy, Inc. and Evenflow, Dropbox's official [[domain name]] was "''get''dropbox.com" until October 2009, when it acquired its current domain, "dropbox.com"&lt;ref name="Domain"/&gt;. In October 2009, Evenflow, Inc. was renamed to Dropbox, Inc.&lt;ref name="dropbox-ipo"/&gt;.

In an interview with ''[[TechCrunch]]''{{'}}s "Founder Stories" in October 2011, Houston explained that a demo video was released during Dropbox's early days, with one viewer being Arash Ferdowsi. Ferdowsi was "so impressed" that they formed a partnership. In regards to competition, Houston stated that "It is easy for me to explain the idea, it is actually really hard to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Zelman |title=(Founder Stories) Drew Houston: "Dropbox Users Save A Billion Files Every Three Days" |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/30/founder-stories-drew-houston-dropbox-users-save-a-billion-files-every-three-days/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 30, 2011 |accessdate=February 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 2010 report in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said that "since [founder Drew Houston] started reading [[Eric Ries]]' [[Lean startup]] blog about a year ago, the company has started trickling out new features when they are ready instead of waiting to launch a fully featured product.

==Business model==
Dropbox uses a freemium business model, where users are offered a free account with a set storage size, with paid subscriptions available that offer more capacity and additional features.&lt;ref name="Dropbox Plus"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Dropbox Plus? |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/6908?path=space_and_storage |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dropbox Basic users are given 2&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s of free storage space.&lt;ref name="Dropbox Plus"/&gt; This can be expanded through referrals; users recommend the service to other people, and if those people start using the service, the user is awarded with additional 500&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte]]s of storage space. Dropbox Basic users can earn up to 16&amp;nbsp;gigabytes through the referral program.&lt;ref name="Referral program"&gt;{{cite web |title=Earn more space by referring friends |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/54?path=space_and_storage |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dropbox Plus subscription (named Dropbox Pro prior to March 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Adams |title=Dropbox Pro is now Dropbox Plus |url=https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2017/03/dropbox-plus/ |website=Dropbox Blog |publisher=Dropbox |date=March 2, 2017 |accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) gives users 1&amp;nbsp;[[terabyte]] of storage space, as well as additional features, including:
* Advanced sharing controls: When sharing a link to a file or folder, users can set passwords and expiration limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shared links controls overview |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/5886 |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Remote wipe: If a device is stolen or lost, users can remotely wipe the Dropbox folder from the device the next time it comes online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Remote wipe overview |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/4227 |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Extended Version History": An available add-on, it makes Dropbox keep deleted and previous versions of files for one year, a significant extension of the default 30-day recovery time.&lt;ref name="Extended Version History"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is extended version history? |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/113 |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Dropbox announced changes to "Dropbox for Business" that would enable users to connect both their personal Dropbox and their business Dropbox to the same device, with each of the folders being "properly labeled for personal or work, and come with its own password, contacts, settings, and files". Furthermore, Dropbox announced shared audit logs, remote wipe for business administrators, and account transfers, as new features of its Business offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ilya |last=Fushman |title=Meet the all-new Dropbox for Business |url=https://blogs.dropbox.com/business/2013/11/meet-the-all-new-dropbox-for-business/ |website=Dropbox Business Blog |publisher=Dropbox |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dropbox for Business changes"&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Dropbox Hits 200M Users, Unveils New "For Business" Client Combining Work And Personal Files |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/13/dropbox-hits-200-million-users-and-announces-new-products-for-businesses/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Dropbox introduced "Smart Sync" for Business and Enterprise customers, a feature that lets [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] users see all files in the Dropbox folder, but only download specific files on-demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rob |last=Baesman |title=Introducing Dropbox Smart Sync and new collaboration tools |url=https://blogs.dropbox.com/business/2017/01/introducing-smart-sync-and-new-collaboration-tools/ |website=Dropbox Business Blog |publisher=Dropbox |date=January 30, 2017 |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Lynley |title=Dropbox’s Smart Sync lets users open a file stored only in the cloud like any normal file |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/30/dropboxs-smart-sync-lets-users-open-a-file-stored-only-in-the-cloud-like-any-normal-file/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=January 30, 2017 |accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to Dropbox Basic, Dropbox Plus users can also earn extra space through referrals. Plus users earn 1&amp;nbsp;gigabyte per referral, up to 32&amp;nbsp;gigabytes.&lt;ref name="Referral program"/&gt;

Dropbox Business is Dropbox's solution for corporations, adding more business-centered functionality for teams, including collaboration tools, advanced security and control, unlimited file recovery, user management and granular permissions, and options for unlimited storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Do more with Dropbox Business |url=https://www.dropbox.com/business |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For large organizations, Dropbox offers Dropbox Enterprise, the "highest tier" of its product offerings, adding domain management tools, an assigned Dropbox customer support member, and help from "expert advisors" on deployment and user training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Dropbox Enterprise? |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/9184?path=dropbox_business |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
The Dropbox software enables users to drop any file into a designated folder. The file is then automatically uploaded to Dropbox's cloud-based service and made available to any other of the user's computers and devices that also have the Dropbox software installed, keeping the file up-to-date on all systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is syncing and how does it work? |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/8839?path=syncing_and_uploads |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a file in a user's Dropbox folder is changed, Dropbox only uploads the [[block (data storage)|pieces of the file]] that have been changed, whenever possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Does Dropbox always upload/download the entire file any time a change is made? |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/8 |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a file or folder is deleted, users can recover it within 30 days. For Dropbox Plus users, this recovery time can be extended to one year, by purchasing an "Extended Version History" add-on.&lt;ref name="Extended Version History"/&gt;

Dropbox accounts that are not accessed or emails not replied in a year are automatically deleted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/23/dropbox-shows-how-it-manages-costs-by-deleting-inactive-accounts.html Dropbox shows how it manages costs by deleting inactive accounts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dropbox also offers a [[Local area network|LAN]] sync feature, where, instead of receiving information and data from the Dropbox servers, computers on the local network can exchange files directly between each other, potentially significantly improving synchronization speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is LAN sync? |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/137?path=syncing_and_uploads |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dropbox originally used [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s [[Amazon S3|S3]] storage system to store user files, but between 2014 and 2016 they gradually moved away from Amazon to use their own hardware, referred to as "Magic Pocket", due to Dropbox's description as "a place where you keep all your stuff, it doesn’t get lost, and you can always access it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cade |last=Metz |title=The epic story of Dropbox's exodus from the Amazon cloud empire |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=March 14, 2016 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, the company announced a major global network expansion, aiming to increase synchronization speeds while cutting costs.

Dropbox prevents sharing of copyrighted data, by checking the [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of files shared in public folders or between users against a [[blacklist]] of copyrighted material.

The '''European Convention on the Repatriation of Minors''' is a 1970 [[Council of Europe]] [[multilateral treaty|treaty]] which allows a state to request that other states return [[Minor (law)|minors]] to its legal jurisdiction.

==Content==
A state party to the Convention is empowered to demand from any state party the [[repatriation]] of any minor from the first state (the "requesting state") who is present in the second state (the "requested state"). A repatriation can be requested in three circumstances:
#the presence of the minor in the requested state is against the will of the legal guardians of the minor;
#the presence of the minor in the requested state is incompatible with a measure of protection or re-education taken in respect of the minor by government authorities of the requesting State; or
#the presence of the minor is necessary in the requesting state because there proceedings there with a view to taking measures of protection and re-education in respect of the minor.

If the requested state has legislation outside of the Convention which allows for the repatriation of minors upon request, the Convention also allows repatriation in cases where the requesting state deems the minor's presence in the requested state to be incompatible with the interests of the minor or the interests of the requesting state.

==Conclusion, signatures, and ratifications==
The Convention was concluded in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], on 28 May 1970. It was opened for ratification or accession by all states, including states not part of the Council of Europe. On the date of conclusion, it was signed by [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[West Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]]. It was later signed by [[Italy]] (1971), [[Turkey]] (1974), [[Greece]] (1980), and [[Malta]] (2015).

To enter into force, the Convention required three states to ratify or accede to it. In 1976, Turkey was the first country to ratify. Italy ratified the Convention in 1995 and Malta ratified in 2015. As a result, the Convention entered into force on 28 July 2015.

'''Factual association''' (''Association de Fait'' in [[French language|French]], ''Feitelijke Vereniging'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is a [[judicial]] [[technical term|term]] used in [[Continental Europe]]an [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], as well as in some derived law systems.

A factual association is an [[organization]] which only exists because of a common achievement or goal. When two people decide to develop something together, the factual association is born.  ''[[Stricto sensu]]'', it is a [[Club (organization)|club]] without a special judicial ground. The factual association can never be a part in [[contracts]], can never own [[property]], can never make [[donations]] or accept [[Will (law)|legacies]]. Every action made by the organization must be made in name of one of the members who will be [[Legal liability|personally responsible]] for the [[wikt:consequence|consequences]] of that action. 

To secure [[political]] [[independence]], in most European countries, political [[parties]] are factual associations. Because of that status, they can never be condemned as a whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15798">The '''Fishman Affidavit''' is a set of court documents submitted by ex-Scientologist [[Steven Fishman]] in 1993 in the federal case, ''Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz'' (Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx) [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]]).

The [[affidavit]] contained criticisms of the [[Church of Scientology]] and substantial portions of the [[Operating Thetan]] [[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] and course materials.

==Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz==
The documents were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by Steven Fishman on 9 April 1993 as part of ''Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz''. Along with [[Kendrick Moxon]] and Laurie Bartilson, [[Tim Bowles|Timothy Bowles]] was one of the lead attorneys for the Church of Scientology in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Fishman told the court that he had committed crimes on behalf of the Church. He also attested that he was assigned to [[murder]] his psychologist, Dr. Uwe Geertz, and then commit [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="greed"&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Behar |authorlink=Richard Behar |title=The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972865-1,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher= |id= |date=1991-05-06 |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doublecrossed"&gt;{{cite web | first = Tony | last = Ortega | title = Double Crossed | url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/double-crossed/full | work = [[Phoenix New Times]] | publisher = [[Village Voice Media]] | date = 1999-12-23 | accessdate = 2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;Fishman received a mail fraud conviction three years earlier, and he claimed being brainwashed by the Church and that he had committed the crime to cover the cost of his Scientology sessions. The court rejected Fishman’s defense and he was soon after sued for libel by Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowan |first1=Douglas E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91me_xjHB_gC&amp;vq=fishman&amp;dq=Scientology+xenu+internet+OT&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Religion Online: Finding Faith on the Internet |editor-last=Cowan |editor-first=Douglas E. |editor2-last=Dawson |editor2-first=Lome L. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |accessdate=2015-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As evidence, Fishman submitted course materials he said that he purchased from Ellie Bolger, a fellow Scientologist, and [[Richard Ofshe]], an expert witness for his defense. The Church says the documents were stolen and considers them to be [[copyright]]ed and a [[trade secret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/cyberlaw/scientology3.html |title=Court TV Library |date=1999-11-28 |accessdate=2007-08-22 |work=Court TV Online Legal Documents |quote=Plaintiff claims that these documents are protected from both unauthorized use and unauthorized disclosure under the copyright laws of the United States and under trade secret laws, respectively. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718105816/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/cyberlaw/scientology3.html |archivedate=2007-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other materials, the [[affidavit]] contains 61 pages of the allegedly trade-secret and copyrighted story of [[Xenu]].

The Fishman Affidavit contains much text from the old versions of the Operating Thetan levels. The versions of OT I to OT VII in the Fishman Affidavit are considered authentic as the church's [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC) brought [[copyright]] lawsuits over their release on the [[Internet]]. Fishman's description of [[OT VIII]] contains the accusation that [[Jesus]] was a [[pedophile]]. After initially asserting copyright to all the OT level descriptions in the affidavit, RTC amended its claim to remove the OT VIII description, calling it a forgery. Fishman stated that he had obtained his copy of OT VIII from Ofshe, a different source than his copies of the other OT Levels, purchased from a fellow Scientologist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/fishman.html Press Release by Steven Fishman], "Press Release: Scientology upper level references (OT materials) affirmed unsealed and in the public domain by United States Court of Appeals.", Pages 1-7., April 28, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology dropped its libel case against Fishman and Geertz in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Wayne | last = Garcia | title = Church of Scientology settles suit with PR firm | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51847739.html?dids=51847739:51847739&amp;FMT=FT | work = | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 1994-07-07 | quote=Earlier this year, Scientology dropped its libel case against former Scientologist Steve Fishman and his therapist, Uwe Geertz. | accessdate = 2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important side aspect of the case was the fact that several high-ranking Scientology officials and lead attorneys for the organization and former high-ranking Scientologists submitted declarations on their activities for the Church of Scientology, giving thereby insight into the internal ongoings of the Scientology management.

Among others, declarations were submitted by:

* Richard Aznaran &amp; Vicki Aznaran, former executives of the [[Religious Technology Center]]
* Jonathan Epstein, at that time International [[Finance Director]] of the [[Church of Scientology International]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Declaration Jonathan Epstein 1994.pdf|Declaration of Jonathan Epstein, Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman &amp; Uwe Geertz, Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Los Angeles, February 7th, 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posting to the Internet==
Although the Church of Scientology attempted to prevent others from receiving the document by continuously borrowing it, the text of this declaration and its exhibits were scanned, [[Optical character recognition|converted to text]], and posted onto the [[Usenet]] newsgroup [[alt.religion.scientology]] by ex-Scientologist [[Arnaldo Lerma|Arnie Lerma]].&lt;ref name="rtcvlerma"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/Scientology_cases/brinkema_rtc_washpost_112895.opinion |title = Civil Action No. 95-1107-A |accessdate = 2007-10-10 |publisher = [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material was then placed on the [[World Wide Web]] by [[David S. Touretzky]].

Lerma's newsgroup posting resulted in the August 1995 [[Scientology and the Internet|raid of his home]] for copyright violation on the materials, and the resulting lawsuit ''Religious Technology Center (Scientology) vs Arnaldo Lerma, Richard Leiby, and The Washington Post''.&lt;ref name="rtcvlerma"/&gt; U.S. Federal Judge [[Leonie Brinkema]] ruled that while Richard Leiby and the [[Washington Post]] had not violated copyright, Lerma was liable and fined $2,500 but with no costs awarded to Scientology. Judge Brinkema also stated that the primary motivation for the case was "to stifle criticism of Scientology in general and to harass its critics."&lt;ref name=nightmare&gt;{{cite web | first = Alan | last = Prendergast | title = Nightmare on the Net | url = http://www.westword.com/1997-03-06/news/nightmare-on-the-net/full | work = [[Westword|Denver Westword]] | publisher = [[Village Voice Media]] | date = 1997-03-06 | accessdate = 2008-07-08 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hushhush&gt;{{cite web | first = Alan | last = Prendergast | title = Hush-Hush Money | url = http://www.westword.com/1997-08-14/news/hush-hush-money/full | work = [[Westword|Denver Westword]] | publisher = [[Village Voice Media]] | date = 1997-08-14 | accessdate = 2008-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being posted to the newsgroup, the documents were mirrored on hundreds of websites worldwide.&lt;ref name="scholarship"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/OTIII |title=OT III Scholarship Page |accessdate = 2007-10-10 |publisher = David S. Touretzky}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology responded by [[lawsuit|suing]] a number of people and their [[Internet service provider]]s for [[Scientology and the Internet|copyright infringement]]. The defendants responded by challenging the church to prove it was actually the copyright holder of the disputed documents.

The other notable case in connection with this was against [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer [[Karin Spaink]]. The Church brought suit on copyright violation grounds for reproducing the source material, and claimed rewordings would reveal a trade secret. In 2003, Spaink won the case, with the court holding that her quotation of Scientology works was acceptable and expressing concern about Scientology's attempts to prevent discussion of its doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Wendy M. | last = Grossman | title = The mills of Xenu grind exceeding slow | url = http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=11516 | work = | publisher = [[The Inquirer]] | date = 2003-09-12 | accessdate = 2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church appealed but dropped the case after a negative advice on the appeal from the Attorney-General to the court in March 2005. In December 2005 the court dismissed the appeal, making the previous ruling final. The Church has no further possibility for appeal due to their dropping the case. The ruling also reversed earlier decisions affecting [[Hyperlinks|hyperlinking]].&lt;ref name="zdnetuk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/itmanagement/0,1000000308,39116197,00.htm |title = Hyperlinks remain legal after Scientology defeat |accessdate = 2007-10-10 |publisher = ZDNet UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the church have accused it of intentionally using lawsuits in these and other cases as [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|SLAPP]] suits, intended to silence their opposition. Critics of Steven Fishman have produced the affidavit of Kenneth D. Long, a Scientology executive, which states that Fishman received services from a Scientology mission, did a few introductory courses, never worked for the Church or [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights|CCHR]], and did not get any auditing or do any courses at the main Miami church, which would conflict with his claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_kl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516095709/http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_kl.html |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }} Affidavit of Kenneth D. Long, April 10, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Vicki Aznaran, a former Scientologist who was involved in anti-Scientology litigation before retracting her claims as part of a settlement with Scientology, gave a declaration through Scientology attorneys in which she states various allegations made by Steven Fishman and other church critics are untrue,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bernie.cncfamily.com/sc/Aznaran.htm] The Declaration of Vicki Aznaran&lt;/ref&gt; contradicting her previous declaration given in ''CSI v.

'''Hamilton v Papakura District Council''' (New Zealand) [2002] UKPC 9 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding liabililty under tort for negligence under [[Rylands v Fletcher]].&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Hamiltons grew [[hydroponic]] [[cherry tomato]]es, using the [[Papakura]] town water supply to supply their water needs. When they found their crop had been destroyed, they claimed that the water supply company and the local council were at fault, claiming that the water was contaminated by minute traces of herbicide in the water supply.

They claimed that this was a breach of the [[Sale of Goods Act]] [1908].

[[Jewish history|Jewish communities]] have existed across the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] since [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]. By the time of the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, these ancient communities had been ruled by various empires and included the [[Babylonian Jews|Babylonian]], [[Persian Jews|Persian]], [[Jews in Carthage|Carthaginian]], [[Hellenistic Jews|Greek]], [[Roman Jews|Roman]], [[Byzantine Jews|Byzantine]], [[Old Yishuv|Ottoman]] and [[Yemenite Jews]].

[[Islamic–Jewish relations|Jews under Islamic rule]] were given the status of [[dhimmi]], along with certain other pre-Islamic religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bat Ye'or (1985), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[second-class citizen]]s, these non-Muslim groups were nevertheless accorded certain rights and protections as "[[people of the book]]". During [[Jews in the Middle Ages|waves of persecution in Medieval Europe]], many [[Jewish refugees|Jews found refuge]] in Muslim lands.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1984 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula|Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula]] were invited to settle in various parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they would often form a prosperous [[model minority]] of merchants [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|acting as intermediaries for their Muslim rulers]].

Today, Jews residing in [[Muslim countries]] have been [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|reduced to a small fraction]] of their [[Historical Jewish population comparisons|former sizes]], with [[Jews in Iran|Iran]] and [[Jews in Turkey|Turkey]] being home to the largest remaining Jewish populations.

==Middle Ages==

===Muslim conquests===
{{main|History of the Jews in the Arabian Peninsula}}
There were, for a long but uncertain period, a significant number of Jews in [[Arabia]]. Historians claim that very large numbers of Jews – as many as 80,000 – arrived after the destruction of the [[First Temple]], to join others already long-established in places such as the oasis of [[Khaybar]] as well as the trading colonies in [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]] (where they had their own [[cemetery]]). Another theory posits that these Jews were refugees from [[Byzantine]] persecutions. Arab historians mention some 20 Jewish communities, including two of [[Kohanim]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''The Crisis of Islam'' (London, 2003), p. XXVII&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Medina]], written shortly after [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]], addressed some points regarding the civil and religious situation for the Jewish communities living within the city from an Islamic perspective. For example, the constitution stated that the Jews "will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs", and they "shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for theirs". After the [[Battle of Badr]], the Jewish tribe of [[Banu Qaynuqa]] breached treaties and agreements with Muhammad. Muhammad regarded this as [[casus belli]] and besieged the [[Banu Qaynuqa]]. Upon surrender the tribe was expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Kathir p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The following year saw the expulsion of the second tribe, the [[Banu Nadir]], accused of planning to kill the prophet Muhammad. The third major Jewish tribe in Medina, [[Banu Qurayza]] was eliminated after  betraying the Muslims during the [[Battle of the Trench]]. However, there were many Jewish communities in Medina who continued to live in Medina peacefully after these events such as [[Banu Awf]], [[Banu Harith]], [[Banu Jusham]] [[Banu Alfageer]], [[Banu Najjar]], [[Banu Sa'ida]], and [[Banu Shutayba]].&lt;ref&gt;Stillman ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irvin and Sunquist, ''History of the World Christian Movement'', Vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 2001), p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

In year 20 of the Muslim era, or the year 641 AD, Muhammad's successor the Caliph [[Umar]] decreed that Jews and Christians should be removed from all but the southern and eastern fringes of Arabia—a decree based on the uttering of the Prophet: "Let there not be two religions in Arabia". The two populations in question were the Jews of the [[Khaybar]] oasis in the north and the Christians of [[Najran]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''The Crisis of Islam'' (London, 2003) p. XXVII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''The Crisis of Islam'' (London, 2003), p. XXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; Only the Red Sea port of [[Jeddah]] was permitted as a "religious quarantine area" and continued to have a small complement of Jewish merchants.

===During the Caliphates===
[[Image:Al-andalus_229.png|thumb|A Jew and a Muslim playing chess in 13th century [[al-Andalus]].]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], Jewish people under Muslim rule experienced tolerance and integration.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"&gt;Cohen, Mark R. "[https://www.academia.edu/6560487/Neo_lachrymose_Conception_of_Jewish-Arab_History The Neo-Lachrymose Conception of Jewish-Arab History]." ''Tikkun'' 6.3 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}} Some historians refer to this time period as the "Golden Age" for the Jews, as more opportunities became available to them.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt; In the context of day-to-day life, Abdel Fattah Ashour, a professor of medieval history at Cairo University, states that Jewish people found solace under Islamic rule during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|56}} The Muslim rule at times didn't fully enforce the [[Pact of Umar]] and the traditional [[Dhimmi]] status of Jews; i.e., the Jews sometimes, as in eleventh-century [[Granada]], were not second-class citizens. Author Merlin Swartz referred to this time period as a new era for the Jews, stating that the attitude of tolerance led to Jewish integration into Arab-Islamic society.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|56}}

Social integration allowed Jews to make great advances in new fields, including mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, chemistry and philology,&lt;ref&gt;Cowling (2005), p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; with some even gaining political power under Islamic rule.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|55}} For example, the [[vizier]] of [[Baghdad]] entrusted his capital to Jewish bankers, Jews were put in charge of certain parts of maritime and slave trade, and [[Siraf]], the principal port of the caliphate in the 10th century, had a Jewish governor.&lt;ref&gt;Poliakov (1974), pg.68-71&lt;/ref&gt; Increased commercial freedom increased their integration into the Arab marketplace.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} [[Leon Poliakov]] writes that in the early ages of Islam, Jews enjoyed great privileges, and their communities prospered. No laws or social barriers restricted their commercial activities, and exclusive trade and craft guilds like those in Europe did not exist. Jews who moved to Muslim lands found themselves free to engage in any profession, resulting in less stigma than in Europe where such restrictions were still in force.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} This, coupled with more intense Christian persecution, encouraged many Jews to migrate to areas newly conquered by Muslims and establish communities there.

Although Jewish life improved under Islamic rule, an interfaith utopia did not exist.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}}  Jews still experienced persecution. Under Islamic Rule, the [[Pact of Umar]] was introduced, which protected the Jews but also established them as inferior.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|59}} Since the 11th century, there have been instances of [[pogrom]]s against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Jews_in_Arab_lands_(gen).html The Treatment of Jews in Arab/Islamic Countries]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[1066 Granada massacre]], the razing of the entire Jewish quarter in the [[Al-Andalus|Andalucian]] city of [[Granada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North Africa]], there were cases of violence against Jews in the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/morocjews.html|title=The Jews of Morocco}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other Arab lands including [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/egjews.html|title=The Jews of Egypt|work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/syrianjews.html|title=The Jews of Syria|work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yemen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/yemenjews.html|title=The Jews of Yemen|work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 15th century, the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] Jewish population was confined to segregated quarters known as [[mellah]]s. In cities, these were surrounded by walls and a [[fortified gateway]]. Rural ''mellahs'', however, were separate villages inhabited solely by Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/017/morocco.html The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G. Bennett]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Almohad]]s, who had taken control of much of Islamic Iberia by 1172, were far more fundamentalist in outlook than the [[Almoravides]], and they treated the ''dhimmis'' harshly. Jews and Christians were expelled from [[Morocco]] and [[Islamic Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 The Forgotten Refugees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051923/http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, some Jews, such as the family of [[Maimonides]], fled south and east to more tolerant Muslim lands, while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html Sephardim], ''Jewish Virtual Library'', Rebecca Weiner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, Joel L., ''Moses Maimonides: An Intellectual Portrait'' in ''The Cambridge Companion to Maimonides'' pp. 16-17 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1465, Arab mobs in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] slaughtered thousands of Jews, leaving only 11 alive, after a Jewish deputy vizier treated a Muslim woman in an offensive manner. The killings touched off a wave of similar massacres throughout [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsje.org/Jews%20Kicked%20out%20of%20Arab%20Lands%20Part%202.htm Jews kicked out of Arab Countries Part 2: The Persecution of Jews prior to 1948], Historical Society of Jews from Egypt&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Mark R. Cohen proposes a comparative approach to understanding Jewish life under Islamic rule, noting that Jews in Islamic lands often experienced less physical violence than Jews under Western Christendom.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} He posits that Muslims considered Jews less theologically threatening than Christians did, suggesting that the Christians wanted to establish a separate religious identity from Judaism, from which their faith split and diverged.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} According to him, instances of persecution were occasional, more the exception than the rule,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|59}} and claims of systemic persecution at the hands of Muslim rulers are myths created to bolster political propaganda.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|56}} {{dubious|date=April 2017}} The situation where Jews in the Muslim world both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times, but were widely persecuted there at other times, was summarised by G. E. Von Grunebaum:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Von Grunebaum, ''Eastern Jewry Under Islam'', 1971, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Seljuk Empire (1077-1307) and early Ottoman rule===
{{main|History of the Jews in Turkey}}
Jews have lived in [[Asia Minor]] for more than 2,400 years. Originally settling in Asia Minor in the Hellenistic era, they were expelled by Byzantines between the 5th and 11th centuries{{fact|date=November 2018}}, resettling there only after the conquest of much of Anatolia by Muslim [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] forces after the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. Jewish communities grew and thrived under the Seljuks, and later also under Ottoman rule, making it a safe haven for Jews fleeing from persecution elsewhere.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Early Modern Period==

===Ottoman Empire===
The [[Ottoman Empire]] served as a [[refugees|refuge]] for [[History of the Jews in Spain#Number of the exiles|Jewish refugees]] from [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish empire]], especially after the fall of Muslim Spain in 1492 and [[Alhambra decree|Edict of Expulsion]]. This continued through the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], as secret Jews and [[Marranos|forced converts]] continued to flee Spain. The [[Maghreb]] from North Africa similarly found refuge among the Ottomans, as large Arabian cities created their own restrictive Jewish quarters (''[[Mellah]]s'').

[[Image:Jews in Jerusalem 1890s.jpg|thumb|[[Photochrom]] of Jews in Jerusalem, in the 1890s.]]
In 1834, in [[Safed]], [[Ottoman Syria]], local Muslim Arabs carried out a massacre of the [[Old Yishuv|Jewish population]] known as the [[Safed Plunder]].&lt;ref name=bloch&gt;Bloch, Abraham P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mjxJAFawRasC&amp;pg=PA168 One a day: an anthology of Jewish historical anniversaries], 1987. pg. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkelstein1960"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Finkelstein|title=The Jews: their history, culture, and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-QDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 February 2012|year=1960|publisher=Harper|page=679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, the [[History of the Jews in Syria|Jews of Damascus]] were falsely accused of having murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having [[blood libel|used their blood]] to bake [[Matzo|Passover bread]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/reaction.html Americans React to Damascus Blood Libel]&lt;/ref&gt; A Jewish barber was tortured until he "confessed"; two other Jews who were arrested died under torture, while a third converted to Islam to save his life. Throughout the 1860s, the [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jews of Libya]] were subjected to what Gilbert calls punitive taxation. In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in [[Marrakech]] and [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in [[Morocco]]. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in [[Tunis]], and an Arab mob on [[Djerba|Jerba Island]] looted and burned Jewish homes, stores, and synagogues. In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1897, synagogues were ransacked and Jews were murdered in [[Tripolitania]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert179/&gt;

====Kurdistan====
{{main|Kurdish Jews}}
Jews lived in [[Kurdistan]] for thousands of years, before the final and mass migration in 1951-1952 to Israel. The Jews lived under the Ottoman Empire and under the Persian Empire for many years and following World War I, they lived mainly in Iraq, Iran and Turkey, some lived in Syria. Jews lived in many Kurdish urban centers such as Aqra, Dohuk, Arbil, Zakho, Sulaimaniya, Amadia, in Southern Kurdistan, in Saqiz, Bana and Ushno, in Eastern Kurdistan, in Jezira, Nisebin, Mardin and Diyarbakır in Turkey and in Qamishle in North-Western Syria. Jews lived as well in hundreds of villages in the rural and tribal area of Kurdistan, usually one or two families in a village, where they worked as weavers of traditional Kurdish clothing or as tenants of the ''agha'', the landlord or head of the village.

===Persia===
{{main|Persian Jews|History of the Jews in Iran}}
In 1656, all Jews were expelled from [[Isfahan]] and [[forced to convert to Islam]] because of a common belief that their Jewishness was impure. However, as it became known that the converts continued to practice [[Judaism]] in secret and because the treasury suffered from the loss of ''jizya'' collected from the Jews, in 1661 they were allowed to revert to Judaism, although they were still required to wear a distinctive patch on their clothing.&lt;ref name="littman1"&gt;Littman (1979), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, in the eastern Persian city of [[Meshed]], a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]]. The Jews themselves were violently forced to convert, narrowly avoiding complete massacre.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179-182.&lt;/ref&gt; There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.&lt;ref name="littman2"&gt;Littman (1979), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 168..&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- was: &lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;; this is no longer valid but may be in the history --&gt; In 1839, the [[Allahdad incident]], the Jews of [[Mashhad]], [[Iran]], now known as the Mashhadi Jews, were [[anusim|coerced into converting]] to [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Hadassah"&gt;{{cite web  |year=2003  |title=Mashhadi Jews in New-York  |url=http://dangoor.com/issue76/articles/76014.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote of [[Persian Jews]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town…; for they are considered as unclean creatures…  Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…  For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans…  If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults.  The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him… unmercifully…  If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods… Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)…, he is sure to be murdered."''&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bukhara===
A number of groups of [[Persian Jews]] have split off since ancient times, to the extent that they are now recognized as separate communities, such as the [[Bukharian Jews]] and [[Mountain Jew]]s.

Confined to [[ghetto|city quarters]], the [[Bukharan Jews]] were denied basic rights and many were forced to [[Chala (Jews)|convert]] to Islam. They had to wear black and yellow dress to distinguish themselves from the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Bukharan_Jews.html Bukharan Jews], Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}

===Zaydi Yemen===

Under the [[Zaydi]] rule, discriminatory laws became more severe against the [[Yemenite Jews]], which culminated in their eventual exile, in what later became known as the [[Exile of Mawza]]. They were considered to be impure, and therefore forbidden to touch a Muslim or a Muslim's food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, to walk to the left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim's or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by Islamic youth, a Jew was not allowed to defend himself. In such situations he had the option of fleeing or seeking intervention by a merciful Muslim passerby.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Communities in Exotic Places," by Ken Blady, [[Jason Aronson]] Inc., 2000, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-colonial era==

===Arab League===
{{further| Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
By the mid 1970s the vast majority of Jews [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|had left, fled or had been expelled]] from Arab and Muslim-majority  countries, moving primarily to Israel, France and the United States.&lt;ref name=Shenhav&gt;[[Yehouda Shenhav]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=k7FoMi-qY4kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Arab Jews: A Postcolonial Reading of Nationalism, Religion, and Ethnicity]&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed.&lt;ref name=Shenhav/&gt; In 1945, there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as [[Libya]], which once had a Jewish population of around 3 percent, similar to that of the [[American Jews|United States]] today), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.

The largest communities of Jews in Muslim countries exist in the non-Arab countries of [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]; both, however, are much smaller than they historically have been. Among Arab countries, the largest Jewish community now exists in [[Morocco]] with about 2,000 Jews and in Tunisia with about 1,000.

===Imperial Iran and Islamic Republic===
Judaism is the second-oldest religion still existing in Iran after [[Zoroastrianism]]. By various estimates, between 8,000 and 10,000 Jews remain in [[Iran]], mostly in [[Tehran]] and [[Hamedan]]. About one-third of the some 120,000-150,000 Iranian Jews in the mid-20th century fled the country during the 1950s, as a consequence of political instability. Most of the remaining 80,000-100,000 Jews fled during and following the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Today, the largest groups of Persian Jews are found in [[Israel]] (236,000-360,000 in 2014, including second-generation Israelis) and the [[United States]] (45,000, especially in the [[Los Angeles]] area, home to a large concentration of [[expatriate]] Iranians). There are also smaller communities in Western Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24606">'''Intelligence-led policing''' ('''ILP''') is a [[policing]] model built around the assessment and management of risk.&lt;ref name="Intelligence"&gt;Willem de Lint, “Intelligence in Policing and Security: Reflections on Scholarship,” Policing &amp; Society, Vol. 16, no. 1 (March 2006): 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intelligence officer]]s serve as guides to operations, rather than operations guiding intelligence.&lt;ref name="RCMP"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police, [http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/crimint/intelligence_e.htm “Intelligence-led policing: A Definition,”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515144758/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/crimint/intelligence_e.htm |date=2006-05-15 }} RCMP Criminal Intelligence Program. Retrieved 13 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Calls for intelligence-led policing originated in the 1990s, both in [[Policing in the United Kingdom|Britain]] and in the [[Policing in the United States|United States]].  In the U.S., [[Mark Riebling]]'s 1994 book [[Wedge - The Secret War between the FBI and CIA]] spotlighted the conflict between law enforcement and intelligence, and urged cops to become "more like spies."  Intelligence-led policing gained considerable momentum globally following the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] on the [[United States]]. It is now advocated by the leading police associations in [[North America]] and the UK.&lt;ref name="Intelligence-led"&gt;Edmund F. McGarrell, Joshua D. Freilich, and Steven Chermak, “Intelligence-led Policing as a Framework for Responding to Terrorism,” Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice, Vol. 23, no. 2 (May 2007): 142-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although intelligence-led policing builds on earlier paradigms, such as [[community policing]], [[problem-oriented policing]], and the partnership model of policing,&lt;ref name="Intelligence-led"/&gt; it originated as a rejection of the "reactive" focus on crime of [[community policing]], with calls for police to spend more time employing informants and surveillance to combat recidivist offenders.&lt;ref name="Audit Commission"&gt;Audit Commission "Helping With Enquiries: Tackling Crime Effectively" (London: HMSO, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,{{when|date=December 2014}} intelligence-led policing has undergone a 'revisionist'&lt;ref name="Uniform styles"&gt;Hale, C., Heaton, R. and Uglow, S. (2004) "Uniform styles? Aspects of police centralization in England and Wales", Policing and Society, Vol. 14, no. 3 (2004), 291-312.&lt;/ref&gt; expansion to allow incorporation of reassurance and neighbourhood policing.&lt;ref name="Managerialism"&gt;Maguire, M. and John, T. "Intelligence led policing, managerialism and community engagement: Competing priorities and the role of the National Intelligence Model in the UK", Policing and Society, Vol. 16 no. 1 (2006): 67-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Prior to intelligence-led policing, a responsive strategy was the main method of policing. However, as crime was perceived to outgrow police resources in the UK,{{when|date=August 2015}} there was a demand gap, and a call{{by whom|date=December 2014}} for a new strategy that would more efficiently use the resources available at the time &lt;ref name ="anderson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=R.|editor1-last=Smith|editor1-first=A.|title=Intelligence Led Policing: International Perspectives on Policing in the 21st Century|date=1994|publisher=International Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence Analysts|location=Lawrenceville, NJ|pages=5–8|chapter=Intelligence led policing: A British perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early development of intelligence-led policing took place in the UK. It was perceived that police were spending too much time responding to specific incidents, and not tackling the problem of repeat offenders. Therefore, reports by the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]]&lt;ref name ="Audit Commission"/&gt; in 1993 and [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary]] in 1997 advocated increased use of intelligence, surveillance and informants to target recidivist offenders, so that police could be more effective in fighting crime. The call was quickly taken up by some police forces, particularly the [[Kent Constabulary]].&lt;ref name = "ratcliffe1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ratcliffe|first1=Jerry|title=Intelligence-Led Policing|date=2008|publisher=Willan Publishing|location=Cullompton, Devon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Intelligence led policing was not a major proponent of policing styles until the September 11th terrorist attacks. Prior to these attacks the majority of all branches of the government would often not divulge any information to each other.
The main assumptions of this theory can be described by Ratcliffe’s 3i format. As shown by the figure below,the three I’s call for close cooperation between police chiefs and intelligence analysts in order to facilitate a strategy that will impact the criminal environment.&lt;ref name = "ratcliffe1" /&gt;
[[File:Figure 5-5 (3i model).tif|alt=history|thumb|&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931860419|title=Intelligence-led policing|last=Jerry|first=Ratcliffe,|isbn=9781138858985|edition=Second|location=London|oclc=931860419}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Misconceptions==
Oftentimes the intelligence in intelligence led policing is seen as the gathering of information, however the process does not start or begin there. The National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan (NCISP) which was introduced in 2003 contained 28 recommendations for major changes to policing and a process of collecting data. NCISP is a process of intelligence, also known as the [[intelligence cycle]].&lt;ref name="DOJ"&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/210681.pdf |title=Intelligence-Led Policing: The New Intelligence Architecture |publisher=Bureau of Justice Assistance |author=Peterson, Marilyn |date=September 2005 |id={{NCJ|210681}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligence is seen as information that has been gathered and analyzed. This can be done through computer software but usually that only simplifies data, instead to be considered intelligence it must be analyzed by a trained analyst.

==Camden Study==
[[Camden, New Jersey]] was once considered one of the most violent cities in the world. This was attributed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} to the large amount of violent crimes that were reported in the city.{{clarify|date=December 2014}} The large amount of violent crime was attributed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} to the disputed "gang corners". On these gang corners, rival gangs would often dispute territory boundaries of where they could sell drugs. A study found that the majority of crime took place in areas that had multiple gangs.&lt;ref name = "ratcliffe2"&gt;Ratcliffe, J.H. and Taniguchi, T. A. (in press) “Is crime higher around drug‐gang street corners? Two spatial approaches to the relationship between gang set spaces and local crime levels”. Crime Patterns and Analysis, Vol 1, Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Through interviews with police officers, the study also found that their focus was more on gang activity, rather than the location of said activity. Therefore, in order to change the environment, the police department of Camden would use a "location denial strategy", where a police officer would be placed in these locations until they were no longer disputed.{{clarify|date=December 2014}}

==United Kingdom==
Intelligence-led policing in the UK has been applied as a specialized police practice involving the identification and targeting of high-rate, chronic offenders, and devising strategic interventions based on that intelligence.&lt;ref name="Intelligence-led"/&gt; ILP originated as a problem-oriented strategy in Northern Ireland (Royal Ulster Constabulary) and was adopted by the Kent and Northumbria Constabularies in combating [[motor vehicle theft]] and other [[property crime]].

Kent prioritized{{when|date=December 2014}} its [[calls for service]], placing less priority on minor service calls, and referring them to other agencies, in order to provide police with more time to focus on the property crimes. Rather than reactively responding to individual incidents, a systematic analysis of offenses was conducted, which showed that a small number of offenders were responsible for a disproportionately large number of motor vehicle thefts in the area, as well as identifying repeat victims and problem areas. Using this knowledge to formulate a response, the automobile theft rate dropped significantly.&lt;ref name="Intelligence-led"/&gt; Since 2000, ILP has been enshrined in Britain as the philosophy underpinning the National Intelligence Model.

==United States==
Intelligence-led policing gained its momentum in the 1970s, when the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals announced that every law enforcement agency should immediately create system for gathering and analyzing data. However, agencies{{which|date=December 2014}} were not governed by policies and violated many civil liberties,{{which|date=December 2014}} resulting in many agencies shutting down their intelligence functions{{when|date=December 2014}} by court order or voluntarily.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1976, standards and policies were introduced{{by whom|date=December 2014}} to address the abuses that had taken place. These stated that an individual had to meet certain criminal criteria{{clarify|date=December 2014}} in order to be entered into intelligence files.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In the 1980s, Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS) Centers, a sharing system, were introduced throughout the nation to collect and store data on criminals.&lt;ref name ="Fusion Centers"/&gt;

The post-9/11 environment in the US, the "era of [[Homeland Security]]" for American policing,&lt;ref&gt;Willard M. Oliver, “The Fourth Era of Policing: Homeland Security,” International Review of Law Computers &amp; Technology, Vol. 20, nos. 1&amp;2 (March–July 2006): 49-62.&lt;/ref&gt; has increased demands for law enforcement to build global partnerships and to work more closely with local agencies to expand the capacity of the state to fight both crime and terrorism. Owing to the belief held by some{{who|date=December 2014}} that 9/11 and other terrorist attacks could have been prevented if not for intelligence failures, a key difference between intelligence-led policing and earlier strategies is that intelligence is no longer considered a specialized function for crime analysts or intelligence units.

Investigations following bombings of the rail systems in [[2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid]] and [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London]] and the arrest of suspected terrorists in [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[Florida]] suggested{{according to whom|date=December 2014}} that intelligence culled from a variety of sources may be the key to identifying suspects and successfully intervening to prevent attacks.&lt;ref name="Intelligence-led"/&gt;

On March 16, 2005, Department of Homeland Security Secretary [[Michael Chertoff]] outlined a risk-based approach to homeland security threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences when he said, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Risk management must guide our decision-making as we examine how we can best organize to prevent, respond, and recover from an attack . . . . Our strategy is, in essence, to manage risk in terms of these three variables – threat, vulnerability, consequence. We seek to prioritize according to these variables, to fashion a series of preventive and protective steps that increase security at multiple levels."&lt;ref&gt;DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, Prepared Remarks at George Washington University Homeland Security Policy Institute (Mar. 16, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006, [[Mark Riebling]] of the [[Center for Policing Terrorism]] published a doctrine on Intelligence-Led Policing. Riebling's model leverages both Israeli counter-terrorist tactics, and the NYPD's [[Broken Windows]] policing theories. Among the Broken Windows mechanisms, Riebling's doctrine blends [[problem solving]], [[environmental design]], [[community policing]], and [[public-private partnerships]].  Analyzing the operations of the Israeli National Police in Tel Aviv, Riebling notes approvingly that "investigation of the incident, even a traffic accident, is secondary to the number one goal—which is gathering intelligence.  "For instance, when they raided a bordello, where the patrons were primarily Arabs from different parts of the region, Israeli police were less concerned about the criminal activity, than with preparing intelligence reports on [[Racial profiling|who these people were]], and how they got into Israel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manhattan-institute.org/pdf/scr_04.pdf Mark Riebling, ''The New Paradigm: Merging Law Enforcement and Intelligence Strategies'', Center for Policing Terrorism, January 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its current conceptualization, intelligence-led policing is envisioned as a tool for information sharing both within law enforcement agencies and between all participants in the community, private sector, intelligence community, and public government. The concept aids law enforcement agencies in identifying threats and developing responses to prevent those threats from reaching fruition in America’s communities. There is no universally accepted definition of ILP, although the components of most definitions are the same or at least similar.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The collection and analysis of information related to crime and conditions that contribute to crime, resulting in an actionable intelligence product intended to aid law enforcement in developing tactical responses to threats and/or strategic planning related to emerging or changing threats.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, D. L. &amp; Carter, J. G. (2009). Intelligence Led Policing:  Conceptual Considerations for Public Policy. Criminal Justice Policy Review, 20(3), 310-325.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Researchers have argued that, while the British experience with ILP has provided an important foundation for U.S. initiatives, there are "important differences in legacy and functional responsibilities that limit the wholesale adoption of the British model in the United States. Among those limitations has been the array of post-9/11 federal standards for the American law enforcement intelligence process, including the new dimension of homeland security intelligence.  One of the differences between the British model and the U.S. model is that of balancing American constitutional rights, and the act of gathering intelligence." &lt;ref name ="Fusion Centers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Robert W.|last2=Davis|first2=Jennifer Elaine|editor1-last=Dunham|editor1-first=Roger G.|editor2-last=Albert|editor2-first=Geoffrey P.|title=Critical Issues in Policing|date=2010|publisher=Waveland Press Inc|location=Long Grove Il|chapter=Intelligence-Led Policing and Fusion Centers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the implementation of ILP is expected{{by whom|date=December 2014}} to be difficult for most U.S. law enforcement agencies, Carter and Carter argue that the experiences and foundation of CompStat and community policing serve as important springboards for success. Although there are substantive differences in the concepts, the similarities serve as reliable policy experiences to make implementation of ILP a functional reality" (p.&amp;nbsp;322)

==Canada==
In the Canadian context, the lineage of intelligence-led policing can be traced to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]’s failure to prevent the 1985 bombing of [[Air India flight 182]]. Post-event analysis concluded that if the RCMP had had a better relationship with the [[Sikh]] community in [[Vancouver]], they might have acquired actionable intelligence alerting them to the plot by extremists looking to establish an independent Sikh state in the [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] region of [[India]].

This was an impetus for the adoption of community policing, but it was soon realized that the focus on “community” was a distraction in that hardened targets are not easily penetrated through better police-community relations; rather, it is the “mode of information that is important.”&lt;ref name="Intelligence"/&gt; Consequently, the RCMP developed its CAPRA model (Clients, Analysis, Partnerships, Response, Assessment), which fits with, and has been re-cast as, intelligence-led policing.&lt;ref name="Intelligence"/&gt;

==New Zealand==
New Zealand has been experimenting with intelligence-led policing since the 1990s and has implemented it throughout the New Zealand Police, which is the national police organization in the country of New Zealand.  Intelligence-led policing is encouraged throughout the districts of the New Zealand Police, and is implemented throughout the country and is an implementation of intelligence-led policing throughout an entire country.&lt;ref name="darroch-mazerolle"&gt;Darroch, S., &amp; Mazerolle, L. (2013). Intelligence-Led Policing: A Comparative Analysis of Organizational Factors Influencing Innovation Uptake. Police Quarterly, 16(1), 3-37.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the results of this experiment is that there was little sharing of information between districts in New Zealand.  In the New Zealand study there were problems both organizational and behavioral that hindered the results of either using the information or gathering the information to make intelligence based decisions.  The New Zealand Police are now implementing more aspects of problem-oriented policing to their intelligence-led policing system.&lt;ref name="ratcliffe4"&gt;Ratcliffe, Jerry. "The Effectiveness Of Police Intelligence Management: A New Zealand Case Study." Police Practice &amp; Research 6.5 (2005): 435-451. Academic Search Premier. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime prevention implications==

ILP is often viewed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} as a management tool instead of a crime reduction strategy. Jerry Ratcliffe claims ten benefits of the use of intelligence led policing: 
# Supportive and informed command structure
# Intelligence-led policing is the heart of an organization‐wide approach
# Integrated crime and criminal analysis
# Focus on prolific and serious offenders
# Analytical and executive training available
# Both strategic and tactical tasking meetings take place
# Much routine investigation is screened out
# Data are sufficiently complete, reliable and available to support quality products that influence decision‐making
# Management structures exist to action intelligence products
# Appropriate use of prevention, disruption and enforcement

He argues that these all help prevent crime by creating a police force that is more efficient with its resources. There is also a growing recognition{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} within policing that external agencies may hold the key to long-term crime reduction. These agencies, such as local councils, housing authorities, and health and education departments, are believed to have a greater potential to impact a wider range of causal factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ericson|first1=R. V.|last2=Haggerty|first2=K. D.|title=Policing the Risk Society|date=1997|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; As agencies share information amongst each other, a larger "network of intelligence" is created, which proponents hope, when used effectively, will cause a substantial decrease in crime.&lt;ref name = "ratcliffe3"&gt;Ratcliffe, Jerry (2003) Trends &amp; Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
Intelligence-led policing is still in its early stages, and therefore lacks a universal conceptual framework that can be applied to disparate contexts as a policing paradigm. Implementation can also be difficult, because it requires police managers to “have faith in the intelligence process and in the judgments and recommendations of their intelligence staff.”&lt;ref name="RCMP"/&gt;

Some have also questioned whether the foundational ingredient - intelligence - has been properly considered, given that police and security professionals already have to contend with “information overload” from the huge databanks that have been built up in the intelligence process, and that increasing raw data is not the same as generating “knowledge” or actionable intelligence.&lt;ref name="Knowledge"&gt;Jean-Paul Brodeur and Benoit Dupont, “Knowledge Workers or ‘Knowledge’ Workers?,” Policing &amp; Society, Vol. 16, no. 1 (March 2006): 7-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

As intelligence-led policing represents a move towards surveillance, it focuses on information collection and analyzing data. However, the way that this data is collected is a concern for privacy advocates.&lt;ref name ="Fusion Centers"/&gt; The United States Supreme Court has not made any particular decisions in relation to searches that deal specifically with intelligence-led policing.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The cases that do cover most searches, such as ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'' (1961) and ''[[Terry v. Ohio]]'' (1968), were decided prior to the implementation of intelligence-led policing.&lt;ref name ="Newton-Welch"&gt;Newton, Samuel P., Welch, Teresa L. Understanding Criminal Evidence: A Case Method Approach. 2013. Wolters Kluwer. Frederick MO.&lt;/ref&gt; The question arises with intelligence-led policing of when a search has occurred.  The U.S. Supreme Court has given a two part test to determine a search in ''[[Katz v. United States]]'' (1967).  The first is an [[expectation of privacy]], and the second is that the expectation of privacy should be reasonable. The issue exists in what type of privacy expectation an individual can hope to have with technology. Technology has given officers access to information that was unobtainable in the past.&lt;ref name ="Newton-Welch"/&gt;

Finally, intelligence-led policing has been described as part of a larger trend of blurring the distinction between national security and domestic policing, risking the same perils that have tarnished policing in the past, such as political interference, violating civil liberties, and a greater potential for the abuse of police power with the increased secrecy that intelligence work entails.&lt;ref name="Knowledge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pickering|first1=Sharon|title=Border Terror: Policing, Forced Migration, and Terrorism|journal=Global Change, Peace &amp; Security|date=October 2004|volume=16|issue=3|pages=211–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were known during the colonial years to the [[French people|French]] as the '''Iroquois League''', and later as the '''Iroquois Confederacy''', and to the [[English people|English]] as the '''Five Nations''', comprising the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Oneida people|Oneida]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca people|Seneca]]. After 1722, they accepted the [[Tuscarora people]] from the Southeast into their confederacy and became known as the '''Six Nations'''.

The Iroquois have absorbed many other peoples into their tribes as a result of warfare, adoption of captives, and by offering shelter to displaced peoples. Culturally all are considered members of the clans and tribes into which they are adopted by families.

The historic [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] (Huron), [[Erie people|Erie]], and [[Susquehannock]], all independent peoples, also spoke [[Iroquoian languages]]. In the larger sense of linguistic families, they are often considered Iroquoian peoples because of their similar languages and cultures, all culturally and linguistically descended from the [[Proto-Iroquoian language|Proto-Iroquoian]] people and language; however, they were traditionally enemies of the nations in the Iroquois League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Daeg de Mott| first1=D.

==Names==

The most common name for the confederacy, '''Iroquois''', is of somewhat obscure origin. The first time it appears in writing is in the account of [[Samuel de Champlain]] of his journey to Tadoussac in 1603, where it occurs as "Irocois".&lt;ref&gt;Day, Gordon M. (Autumn, 1968). "Iroquois: An Etymology." ''Ethnohistory''. '''15(4)''': 389–402.&lt;/ref&gt; Other spellings appearing in the earliest sources include "Erocoise", "Hiroquois", "Hyroquoise", "Irecoies", "Iriquois", "Iroquaes", "Irroquois", and "Yroquois", as the French transliterated the term into their own phonetic system.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, I., "Synonymy." In G. Trigger (Ed.), ''Handbook of North American Indians: Northeast'' (Vol. 15, pp. 319–321). 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In the French spoken at the time, this would have been pronounced as [irokwe] or [irokwɛ].&lt;ref&gt;[e] pronunciation according to Goddard, 1978. [ɛ] pronunciation according to Day, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, several competing theories have been proposed for this name's ultimate origin—the earliest such proposal is by the Jesuit priest [[Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix]], who wrote in 1744:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The name Iroquois is purely French, and is formed from the [Iroquoian-language] term ''Hiro'' or ''Hero'', which means ''I have said''—with which these Indians close all their addresses, as the Latins did of old with their ''dixi''—and of ''Koué'', which is a cry sometimes of sadness, when it is prolonged, and sometimes of joy, when it is pronounced shorter.&lt;ref name="Quoted in Day, 1968"&gt;Quoted in Day, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1883, [[Horatio Hale]] wrote that the Charlevoix etymology was dubious, and that "no other nation or tribe of which we have any knowledge has ever borne a name composed in this whimsical fashion".&lt;ref name="Quoted in Day, 1968"/&gt; Hale suggested instead that the term came from [[Wyandot language|Huron]], and was cognate with Mohawk ''ierokwa'' "they who smoke" or Cayuga ''iakwai'' "a bear". [[John Napoleon Brinton Hewitt|J.N.B. Hewitt]] responded to Hale's etymology in 1888 by expressing doubt that either of those words exist in the respective languages. His preferred etymology at the time was from [[Innu language|Montagnais]] ''irin'' "true, real" and ''ako'' "snake", plus the French ''-ois'' suffix, though he later revised his theory to state that the source was [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] ''Iriⁿakhoiw''.&lt;ref&gt;Day, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H[ewitt], J.N. (1907). "Iroquois". In Hodge, Frederick Webb (Ed.) ''Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico'', pp 617–620.&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of these etymologies gained widespread acceptance. By 1978 [[Ives Goddard]] could write: "No such form is attested in any Indian language as a name for any Iroquoian group, and the ultimate origin and meaning of the name are unknown."&lt;ref name="Goddard, 1978"&gt;Goddard, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more modern etymology is that advocated by Gordon M. Day in 1968, who elaborates upon an earlier etymology given by Charles Arnaud in 1880. Arnaud had claimed that the word came from Montagnais ''irnokué'', meaning "terrible man", via the reduced form ''irokue''. Day proposes a hypothetical Montagnais phrase ''irno kwédač'', meaning "a man, an Iroquois", as the origin of this term. For the first element ''irno'', Day cites cognates from other attested Montagnais dialects: ''irinou'', ''iriniȣ'', and ''ilnu''; and for the second element ''kwédač'' he suggests a relation to ''kouetakiou'', ''kȣetat-chiȣin'', and ''goéṭètjg'' – names used by neighboring Algonquian tribes to refer to the Iroquois, Hurons, and [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|Laurentians]].&lt;ref&gt;Day, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Peter Bakker has proposed a [[Basque language|Basque]] origin for "Iroquois". Basque fishermen and whalers are known to have frequented the waters of the Northeast in the 1500s, so much so that a [[Algonquian–Basque pidgin|Basque-based pidgin]] developed for communication with the Algonquian tribes of the region. Bakker claims that it is unlikely that "-quois" derives from a root specifically used to refer to the Iroquois, citing as evidence that several other Indian tribes of the region were known to the French by names terminating in the same element, e.g. "Armouchiquois", "Charioquois", "Excomminquois", and "Souriquois". He proposes instead that the word derives from ''hilokoa'' (via the intermediate form ''irokoa''), from the Basque roots ''hil'' "to kill", ''ko'' (the locative genitive suffix), and ''a'' (the definite article suffix). In favor of an original form beginning with /h/, Bakker cites alternate spellings such as "hyroquois" sometimes found in documents from the period, and the fact that in the Southern dialect of Basque, the word ''hil'' is pronounced ''il''. He also argues that the /l/ was rendered as /r/ since the former is not attested in the phonemic inventory of any language in the region (including [[Malecite-Passamaquoddy language|Maliseet]], which developed an /l/ later). Thus the word according to Bakker is translatable as "the killer people". It is similar to other terms used by Eastern Algonquian tribes to refer to their enemy the Iroquois, which translate as "murderers".&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, Peter (1991). "A Basque etymology for the Amerindian tribal name ''Iroquois''." ''Anuario del Seminario de Filología Vasca'' (ASJU Geh). '''14(2)''': 1119–1124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, Peter (2002). "Amerindian Tribal Names in North America of Possible Basque Origin". In Artiagoitia, X., R.P.G. de Rijk, P. Goenaga, and J. Lakarra (Ed.), ''Erramau Boneta: Festschrift for Rudolf P. G. de Rijk'', pp. 105–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Nations historically referred to themselves by a different autonym, '''Haudenosaunee''', meaning "People of the Longhouse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/|title=Home - Haudenosaunee Confederacy|website=www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also occasionally preferred by scholars of Native American history, who consider the name "Iroquois" to be derogatory in origin.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Kasak, Ryan M. (2016). "A distant genetic relationship between Siouan-Catawban and Yuchi". In Rudin, Catherine and Bryan J. Gordon (Ed.) ''Advances in the Study of Siouan Languages and Linguistics'', pp. 5–38.&lt;/ref&gt; This name derives from two phonetically similar but etymologically distinct words in the [[Seneca language]]: ''Hodínöhšö:ni:h'', meaning "those of the extended house," and ''Hodínöhsö:ni:h'', meaning "house builders".&lt;ref&gt;Haudenosaunee. (n.d.). Retrieved January 27th, 2017, from http://www.yourdictionary.com/haudenosaunee.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chafe, Wallace (n.d.). ''English - Seneca Dictionary'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goddard, 1978"/&gt; The name "Haudenosaunee" first appears in English in [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1851), where it is written as ''Ho-dé-no-sau-nee''. The spelling "Hotinnonsionni" is also attested from later in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Lewis H. (1851). ''League of the Ho-dé-no-sau-nee or Iroquois''. Rochester: Sage &amp; Brother, Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Goddard, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate designation, '''Ganonsyoni''', is occasionally encountered as well.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in Graymont, Barbara (1972). ''The Iroquois in the American Revolution'', pp. 14–15; Rausch, David A. and Blair Schlepp, (1994). ''Native American Voices'', p 45; and Wolf, Eric R. (1982) ''Europe and the People Without History'', p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; This term derives from the Mohawk ''kanǫhsyǫ́·ni'' ("the extended house"), or from a cognate expression in a related Iroquoian language, and is frequently encountered in earlier sources variously spelled "Kanosoni", "akwanoschioni", "Aquanuschioni", "Cannassoone", "Canossoone", "Ke-nunctioni", or "Konossioni".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; More transparently, the Iroquois confederacy is also often referred to simply as the '''Six Nations''' (or, for the period before the entry of the Tuscarora in 1722, the '''Five Nations''').&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, 1978. This is frequently used on the official Haudenosaunee Confederacy website: http://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is '''Rotinonsionni''' in the [[Mohawk language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://1704.deerfield.history.museum/popups/glossary.do?shortName=rotinonsionni "Rotinonsionni, which is the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) word for Haudenosaunee".

The Iroquois Confederacy is believed to have been founded by [[Great Peacemaker|the Peacemaker]] in 1142, bringing together five distinct nations in the southern Great Lakes area into "The Great League of Peace".&lt;ref name="tIitAmRev"&gt;Graymont, Barbara. ''The Iroquois in the American Revolution'' (1972), pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Each nation within this Iroquoian confederacy had a distinct language, territory, and function in the League. Iroquois influence at the peak of its power extended into present-day Canada, westward along the Great Lakes and down both sides of the Allegheny mountains into present-day Virginia and Kentucky and into the [[Ohio valley|Ohio Valley]].

The League is governed by a Grand Council, an assembly of fifty chiefs or [[sachem]]s, each representing one of the [[clans]] of one of the nations.&lt;ref name="timeline1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zibNDBchPkMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=encyclopedia%20haudenosaunee&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=|title=Encyclopedia of the Haudenosaunee |page=135 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|accessdate=2010-04-02|isbn=978-0-313-30880-2|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Iroquois League (as the French knew them) or Five Nations (as the British knew them), occupied large areas of present-day New York State up to the St. Lawrence River, west of the Hudson River, and south into northwestern Pennsylvania. From east to west, the League was composed of the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]], [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca nation]]s. In or close to 1722, the [[Tuscarora tribe]] joined the League,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Anthony F.C. ''Tuscarora: A History''. Albany: SUNY Press, 2012. {{ISBN|9781438444314}}&lt;/ref&gt; having migrated from the Carolinas after being displaced by Anglo-European settlement. Also an [[Iroquoian language|Iroquoian]]-speaking people, the Tuscarora were accepted into what became the Six Nations.

Other independent Iroquoian-speaking peoples, such as the [[Erie people|Erie]], [[Susquehannock]], Huron (Wendat) and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]], lived at various times along the [[St. Lawrence River]], and around the [[Great Lakes]]. In the American Southeast, the [[Cherokee]] were an Iroquoian-language people who had migrated to that area centuries before European contact. None of these was part of the Haudenosaunee. Those on the borders of Haudenosaunee territory in the Great Lakes region competed and warred with the member nations.

When [[European colonization of the Americas#Early state-sponsored colonists|Europeans first arrived]] in North America, the Haudenosaunee were based in what is now the [[northeastern United States]], primarily in what is referred to today as [[Central New York]] and [[Western New York]], west of the [[Hudson River]] and through the [[Finger Lakes]] region, and [[upstate New York]] along the St. Lawrence River area downstream to today's Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/ethno/etb0170e.shtml |title=First Nations Culture Areas Index |work=the Canadian Museum of Civilization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French, Dutch and British colonists in both New France (Canada) and the what became the Thirteen Colonies recognized a need to gain favor with the Iroquois people, who occupied a significant portion of lands west of colonial settlements. Their first relations with them were for [[fur trading]], which was favorable and became lucrative to both sides. The colonists also sought to establish positive relations to secure their settlement borders.

For nearly 200 years the Iroquois were a powerful factor in North American colonial policy-making decisions. Alignment with Iroquois offered political and strategic advantages to the European colonies, but the Iroquois preserved considerable independence. Some of their people settled in mission villages along the St. Lawrence River, becoming more closely tied to the French. While they participated in French raids on Dutch and later English settlements, where some Mohawk and other Iroquois settled, in general the Iroquois resisted attacking their own peoples.

The Iroquois remained a politically unique, undivided, large Native American polity up until the American Revolution. The League kept its treaty promises to the British Crown. But when the British were defeated, they ceded the Iroquois territory without consultation; many Iroquois had to abandon their lands in the Mohawk Valley and elsewhere and relocate in the northern lands retained by the British. The Crown gave them land in compensation for the 5 million acres they had lost in the south, but it was not equivalent to earlier territory.

The Iroquois League has also been known as the "Iroquois Confederacy". Modern scholars distinguish between the League and the Confederacy.&lt;ref name="Richter11-12"&gt;Richter, "Ordeals of the Longhouse", in Richter and Merrill, eds., ''Beyond the Covenant Chain'', 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Fenton, ''Great Law and the Longhouse'', 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Shannon, ''Iroquois Diplomacy'', 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation, the Iroquois League refers to the ceremonial and cultural institution embodied in the Grand Council, while the Iroquois Confederacy is the decentralized political and diplomatic entity that emerged in response to European colonization. According to that theory, "The League" still exists. The Confederacy dissolved after the defeat of the British and allied Iroquois nations in the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name="Richter11-12" /&gt; Today's Iroquois/Six Nations people do not make any distinction between "The League" and "the Confederacy" and use the terms interchangeably, preferring the name Haudenosaunee Confederacy.

After the defeat of the British, they ceded most of the Iroquois territory to the United States, without bringing their allies to the negotiating table. Many of the Iroquois migrated to Canada, forced out of New York because of hostility to the British allies in the aftermath of a fierce war. Those remaining in New York were required to live mostly on reservations. In 1784, a total of 6,000 Iroquois had to confront 240,000 New Yorkers, with land-hungry New Englanders poised to migrate west. "Oneidas alone, who were only 600 strong, owned six million acres, or about 2.4 million hectares. Iroquoia was a land rush waiting to happen."&lt;ref name="brookhiser"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/19/arts/19iht-idside20.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Richard Brookhiser, "Iroquoia: A land lost in push by British empire and U.S. settlers," Book Review of Alan Taylor's ''The Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution''], ''New York Times'', 19 May 2006, accessed 16 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the major cessions of Iroquois land, the Oneida and others who gained reservations in New York faced increasing pressures for their lands. By the [[War of 1812]], they had lost control of considerable property.

The League has since been compared to a modern-day example of [[anarcho-communism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[libertarian socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colombus, the Indians, and Human Progress|last=Zinn|first=Howard|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Historiography===
Knowledge of Iroquois history stems from Haudenosaunee [[oral tradition]], archaeological evidence, accounts from [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missionaries, and subsequent European historians. Historian Scott Stevens credits the early modern European value for the written word over oral tradition and cultures as contributing to a prejudiced, racialized element within writings about the Iroquois that continued into the 19th century.{{sfn|Stevens|2013|p=149}} The [[historiography]] of the Iroquois peoples is a topic of much debate, especially regarding the American colonial period.{{sfn|Stevens|2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansen|first1=Bruce|title=Notes from the "culture wars": more annotations on the debate regarding the Iroquois and the origins of democracy|journal=American Indian Culture &amp; Research Journal|date=1999|volume=23|issue=1|pages=165–175|doi=10.17953/aicr.23.1.x7035734612286m5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesuit accounts of the Iroquois portrayed them as savages because of comparisons to French culture; the Jesuits perceived them to lack government, law, letters, and religion.&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=Scott Manning|title=The Historiography of New France and the Legacy of Iroquois Internationalism|journal=Comparative American Studies|date=2013|volume=11|issue=2|pages=148–165|doi=10.1179/1477570013Z.00000000037|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.153}} But the Jesuits made considerable effort to study their languages and cultures, and some came to respect them. A major problem with contemporary European sources from the 17th and 18th centuries, both French and British, was that Europeans, coming from a [[patriarchal]] society, did not understand the [[matrilineal]] kinship system of Iroquois society and the related power of women.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 page xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian historian D. Peter MacLeod, writing about the relationship between the Canadian Iroquois and the French in the time of the Seven Years' War, said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Most critically, the importance of [[clan]] mothers, who possessed considerable economic and political power within Canadian Iroquois communities, was blithely overlooked by patriarchal European scribes. Those references that do exist, show clan mothers meeting in council with their male counterparts to take decisions regarding war and peace and joining in delegations to confront the ''Onontio'' [the Iroquois term for the French governor-general] and the French leadership in Montreal, but only hint at the real influence wielded by these women".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eighteenth-century English historiography focuses on the diplomatic relations with the Iroquois, supplemented by such images as [[John Verelst|John Verelst's]] ''[[Four Mohawk Kings]]'', and publications such as the Anglo-Iroquoian treaty proceedings printed by [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;{{rp|p.161}} One historical narrative persistent in the 19th and 20th centuries casts the Iroquois as "an expansive military and political power&amp;nbsp;... [who] subjugated their enemies by violent force and for almost two centuries acted as the fulcrum in the balance of power in colonial North America".&lt;ref name=Stevens /&gt;{{rp|p.148}} Historian Scott Stevens noted that the Iroquois themselves began to influence the writing of their history in the 19th century, including [[Joseph Brant]] (Mohawk), and [[David Cusick]] (Tuscarora). [[John Arthur Gibson]] (Seneca, 1850–1912) was an important figure of his generation in recounting versions of Iroquois history in epics on the [[Great Peacemaker|Peacemaker]].&lt;ref name=G-W1992&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Arthur Gibson|author2=Hanni Woodbury|author3=Reginald Henry|author4=Harry Webster|author5= Alexander Goldenweiser|title=Concerning the League: The Iroquois League Tradition as Dictated in Onondaga by John Arthur Gibson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2991AAAAMAAJ |editor1=series editor John D.

===Formation of the League===
[[File:Atotarhoreceivingtwomohawkchieftains.png|thumb|Iroquois painting of Tadodaho receiving two Mohawk chiefs]]
The Iroquois League was established [[History of the Americas#Civilizations|prior to European contact]], with the banding together of five of the many Iroquoian peoples who had emerged south of the Great Lakes.&lt;ref name="AmHerTage"&gt;''The American Heritage Book of Indians'', American Heritage Publishing, Co., Inc., 1961, Editor: Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., LCcat#: 61-14871&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn
 |''The American Heritage encyclopedia'' relates that the Europeans learned about many of the interior tribes through the names given to them by the coastal tribes whom they first encountered. As the tribes were competitors and often enemies, the coastal peoples referred to the other tribes in terms that reflected their relations. The coastal tribes were among the large family of [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] speakers, such as the Eastern Amerindians of Canada (M'ik Maq and others), and the Lenape of the mid-Atlantic and Powhatan Confederacy of Virginia. The editors add, that Iroquois was a polite name from such people, and its meaning is 'from the south', people of the south, or such similar name.

The Onondagas, situated in the center, were the Fire Keepers as well as the [[Wampum]] Keepers. Onondaga was therefore, the capital, where the Grand Council was held and wampum records were kept. The local [[clan]] chiefs of each tribe meeting together as a unit were the federal chiefs of the League. The Mohawks, Onondagas, and Senecas were the Elder Brothers; The Oneidas and Cayugas, the Younger Brothers. The younger and elder brethren sat on opposite sides of the lodge and counseled across the fire with each other. The Onondagas sat in the middle and kept the balance between the two sides.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One theory argues that the League formed shortly after a [[solar eclipse]] on August 31, 1142, an event thought to be expressed in [[oral tradition]] about the League's origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johansen |first=Bruce |year=1995 |month= |title=Dating the Iroquois Confederacy |journal=Akwesasne Notes New Series |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=62–63 |id= |url=http://www.ratical.org/many_worlds/6Nations/DatingIC.html |accessdate=December 12, 2008 |quote=}}

}} and were much reduced after the [[Beaver Wars]] and high mortality from Eurasian infectious diseases. While the First Nations and Native Americans sometimes tried to remain neutral in the various colonial frontier wars, some also allied with one nation or another, through the [[French and Indian War]]. The Six Nations were split in their alliances between the French and British in that war, the North American front of the Seven Years' War. In warfare the tribes were decentralized, and often bands acted independently.

According to legend, an evil Onondaga chieftain named [[Tadodaho]] was the last converted to the ways of peace by The Great Peacemaker and Hiawatha. He was offered the position as the titular chair of the League's Council, representing the unity of all nations of the League.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080613223453/http://www.onondaganationschool.org/history/history.html "The History of Onondage'ga' "], Onondaga Nation School.&lt;/ref&gt; This is said to have occurred at [[Onondaga Lake]] near present-day [[Syracuse, New York]]. The title ''Tadodaho'' is still used for the League's chair, the fiftieth chief who sits with the Onondaga in council.

With the formation of the League, internal conflicts were minimized. The council of fifty thereafter ruled on disputes, seeking consensus in their decisions.&lt;ref name="AmHerTage"/&gt; Raids within the member tribes ended, and they directed warfare against competitors. This allowed the Iroquois to increase in numbers while their rivals declined.&lt;ref name="AmHerTage"/&gt; The political cohesion of the Iroquois rapidly became one of the strongest forces in 17th- and 18th-century northeastern North America. The confederacy did not speak for all five tribes, which continued to act independently. But about 1678,&lt;ref name="AmHerTage"/&gt; the council exerted more power in negotiations with the colonial governments of Pennsylvania and New York.&lt;ref name="AmHerTage"/&gt; Thereafter, the editors of American Heritage write the Iroquois became very adroit at playing the French off against the British,&lt;ref name="AmHerTage"/&gt; as individual tribes had played the Swedes, Dutch, and English.&lt;ref name="AmHerTage"/&gt; The editors of ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' magazine suggest the Iroquois spokesmen were as politically sophisticated as many a modern politician.&lt;ref name="AmHerTage"/&gt;

As has been noted above, other Iroquoian-language peoples were encountered by early European colonists. While the tribes raided each other, they also traded with the members of the Iroquois who were nearby.&lt;ref name="AmHerTage"/&gt; The explorer [[Robert La Salle]] in the 17th century identified the [[Mosopelea]] as among the Ohio Valley peoples defeated by the Iroquois in the early 1670s.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Augustus Hanna, ''The Wilderness Trail'', New York: Putnam Brothers, 1911, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Erie and peoples of the [[Allegheny River|upper Allegheny valley]] declined earlier during the [[Beaver Wars]].

According to one theory of early Iroquois history, after becoming united in the League, the Iroquois invaded the [[Ohio River Valley]] in the territories that would become the eastern [[Ohio Country]] down as far as present-day [[Kentucky]] to seek additional hunting grounds. They displaced about 1200 [[Siouan language|Siouan]]-speaking tribepeople of the [[Ohio River]] valley, such as the [[Quapaw]] (Akansea), Ofo ([[Mosopelea]]), and [[Tutelo]] and other closely related tribes out of the region.

===Expansion===
In ''[[Reflections in Bullough's Pond]]'', historian [[Diana Muir]] argues that the pre-contact Iroquois were an imperialist, expansionist culture whose cultivation of the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|corn/beans/squash agricultural complex]] enabled them to support a large population. They made war primarily against neighboring [[Algonquian peoples]]. Muir uses archaeological data to argue that the Iroquois expansion onto Algonquian lands was checked by the Algonquian adoption of agriculture. This enabled them to support their own populations large enough to have sufficient warriors to defend against the threat of Iroquois conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Diana, ''Reflections in Bullough's Pond'', University Press of New England, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The People of the Confederacy dispute whether any of this historical interpretation relates to the League of the Great Peace which they contend is the foundation of their heritage.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Iroq2.jpg|thumb|Engraving based on a drawing by Champlain of his 1609 voyage. It depicts a battle between Iroquois and Algonquian tribes near [[Lake Champlain]]]]
The Iroquois may be the ''Kwedech'' described in the oral legends of the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] nation of Eastern Canada. These legends relate that the Mi'kmaq in the late pre-contact period had gradually driven their enemies – the ''Kwedech'' – westward across [[New Brunswick]], and finally out of the Lower [[St. Lawrence River]] region. The Mi'kmaq named the last-conquered land ''Gespedeg'' or "last land," from which the French derived ''Gaspé''. The "Kwedech" are generally considered to have been Iroquois, specifically the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]]; their expulsion from Gaspé by the Mi'kmaq has been estimated as occurring c. 1535–1600.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard G. Hoffman, 1955, ''Souriquois, Etechemin, and Kwedech - - A Lost Chapter in American Ethnography''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}}

Around 1535, [[Jacques Cartier]] reported Iroquoian-speaking groups on the Gaspé peninsula and along the St. Lawrence River. Archeologists and anthropologists have defined the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]] as a distinct and separate group (and possibly several discrete groups), living in the villages of Hochelaga and others nearby (near present-day Montreal), which had been visited by Cartier. By 1608, when [[Samuel de Champlain]] visited the area, that part of the St. Lawrence River valley had no settlements, but was controlled by the Mohawk as a hunting ground. The fate of the Iroquoian people that Cartier encountered remains a mystery, and all that can be stated for certain is when Champlain arrived, they were gone.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=7}} On the Gaspé peninsula, Champlain encountered Algonquian-speaking groups. The precise identity of any of these groups is still debated. On 29 July 1609, Champlain assisted his allies in defeating a Mohawk war party by the shores of what is now called Lake Champlain, and again in June 1610, Champlain fought against the Mohawks.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=7=8}}

The Iroquois became well known in the southern colonies in the 17th century by this time. After the first English settlement in [[Jamestown, Virginia]] (1607), numerous 17th-century accounts describe a powerful people known to the [[Powhatan Confederacy]] as the ''Massawomeck'', and to the French as the ''Antouhonoron''. They were said to come from the north, beyond the [[Susquehannock]] territory. Historians have often identified the ''Massawomeck / Antouhonoron'' as the Haudenosaunee.

In 1649, an Iroquois war party, consisting mostly of Senecas and Mohawks, destroyed the Huron village of [[Wyandot people|Wendake]]. In turn, this ultimately resulted in the breakup of the Huron nation. With no northern enemy remaining, the Iroquois turned their forces on the [[Neutral Nation]]s on the north shore of Lakes Erie and Ontario, the Susquehannocks, their southern neighbor. Then they destroyed other Iroquoian-language tribes, including the [[Erie people|Erie]], to the west, in 1654, over competition for the fur trade.&lt;ref&gt;James F. Pendergast, 1991, ''The Massawomeck''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}} Then they destroyed the [[Mohicans]]. After their victories, they reigned supreme in an area from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Ocean; from the St. Lawrence River to the [[Chesapeake Bay]].&lt;ref name=gg8&gt;{{Cite book |first = Michael |last = Varhola |title = Grantville Gazette Volume VIII:Non-Fiction:New France in 1634 and the Fate of North America |publisher = Baen Books |date = 2006 |location = Newport, TN |doi=10.1125/0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time the Iroquois numbered about 10,000, insufficient to offset the European immigration of up to 100,000 people a year. They had become victims of their own success.&lt;ref name=gg8/&gt;

The Five Nations of the League established a trading relationship with the Dutch at Fort Orange (modern Albany, New York), trading furs for European goods, an economic relationship that profoundly changed their way of life and led to much over-hunting of beavers.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=8}}

Between 1665 and 1670, the Iroquois established seven villages on the northern shores of [[Lake Ontario]] in present-day [[Ontario]], collectively known as the [[Iroquois settlement of the northern shores of Lake Ontario|"Iroquois du Nord" villages]]. The villages were all abandoned by 1701.{{sfnp|Jordan|2013|p=37}}

Over the years 1670–1710, the Five Nations achieved political dominance of much of Virginia west of the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] and extending to the Ohio River valley in present-day West Virginia and Kentucky. As a result of the Beaver Wars, they pushed [[Siouan]]-speaking tribes out and reserved the territory as a hunting ground by [[right of conquest]]. They finally sold the British colonists their remaining claim to the lands south of the Ohio in 1768 at the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]].

===Beaver Wars===
{{See also|Beaver Wars}}

Beginning in 1609, the League engaged in a decades-long series of wars, the so-called [[Beaver Wars]], against the French, their [[Wyandot people|Huron]] allies, and other neighboring tribes, including the Petun, Erie, and Susquehannock.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=8}} Trying to control access to game for the lucrative fur trade, they put great pressure on the [[Algonquian peoples]] of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] (the [[Lenape]] or Delaware), the [[Anishinaabe]] peoples of the boreal [[Canadian Shield]] region, and not infrequently fought the English colonies as well. During the Beaver Wars, they were said to have defeated and assimilated the Huron (1649), Petun (1650), the [[Neutral Nation]] (1651),&lt;ref&gt;Reville, F. Douglas.

Warpaths: Invasions of North America. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional view is that these wars were a way to control the lucrative [[fur trade]] in order to access European goods on which they had become dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, D. ''The Ordeal of the Longhouse: The Peoples of the Iroquois League in the Era of European Colonization'', Chapel-Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Alan Taylor, ''American Colonies,'' Penguin Books, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2013}}

Recent scholarship has elaborated on this view, arguing that the Beaver Wars were an escalation of the "Mourning Wars", which were an integral part of early Iroquoian culture.&lt;ref&gt;Brandão, José A. ''Your Fyre Shall Burn No More: Iroquois Policy towards New France and Its Allies to 1701'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1997. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; This view suggests that the Iroquois launched large-scale attacks against neighboring tribes in order to avenge or replace the massive number of deaths resulting from battles or [[smallpox]] epidemics.

In 1628, the Mohawk defeated the [[Mahican]] to gain a monopoly in the fur trade with the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] at [[Fort Orange]] (present-day Albany), [[New Netherland]]. The Mohawk would not allow northern native peoples to trade with the Dutch.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=8}} By 1640, there were almost no beavers left on their lands, forcing the Iroquois to play the role of the middlemen in the fur trade, as Indian peoples to the west and north possessed the beavers with the thick pelts that the Europeans would pay the best price for.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=8}} In 1645, a tentative peace was forged between the Iroquois and the Huron, Algonquin, and French.

In 1646, [[Jesuit]] missionaries at [[Sainte-Marie among the Hurons]] went as envoys to the Mohawk lands to protect the fragile peace of the time. Mohawk attitudes toward the peace soured while the Jesuits were traveling, and their warriors attacked the party en route. The missionaries were taken to the village of ''[[Ossernenon]]'' (near present-day [[Auriesville]], New York), where the moderate Turtle and Wolf [[clans]] recommended setting the priests free. Angered, members of the Bear clan killed [[Jean de Lalande]], and [[Isaac Jogues]] on October 18, 1646.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=9}} The Catholic Church has commemorated the two French priests and Jesuit lay Brother [[René Goupil]] (killed 29 September 1642) &lt;ref name="puffin.creighton.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_28.html|title=home|date=11 August 2014|website=puffin.creighton.edu|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as among the eight [[North American Martyrs]].

In 1649 during the [[Beaver Wars]], the Iroquois used recently purchased Dutch guns to attack the Huron, who were allied with the French. These attacks, primarily against the Huron towns of [[Taenhatentaron]] (St. Ignace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=14461|title=HistoricPlaces.ca - HistoricPlaces.ca|website=www.historicplaces.ca|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and St. Louis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=14403|title=HistoricPlaces.ca - HistoricPlaces.ca|website=www.historicplaces.ca|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in what is now [[Simcoe County, Ontario|Simcoe County]], [[Ontario Province|Ontario]] were the final battles that effectively destroyed the [[Huron Confederacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, Bruce G. ''The Children of Aataentsic: A History of the Huron People to 1660'', McGill-Queen's University Press; Kingston and Montreal, 1987, p. 751&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuit missions in Huronia on the shores of Georgian Bay were abandoned in the face of the Iroquois attacks with the Jesuits leading the surviving Hurons east towards the French settlements on the St. Lawrence.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=9}} The Jesuit ''Relations'' expressed some amazement that the Five Nations had been able to dominate the area "for five hundred leagues around, although their numbers are very small".{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=9}} From 1651 to 1652, the Iroquois attacked the [[Susquehannock]], located to their south in present-day Pennsylvania, without sustained success.

In the early 17th century, the Iroquois Confederacy was at the height of its power, with a total population of about 12,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Parkman]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1653 the Onondaga Nation extended a peace invitation to New France. An expedition of Jesuits, led by [[Simon Le Moyne]], established [[Sainte Marie among the Iroquois|Sainte Marie de Ganentaa]] in 1656 in their territory. The Jesuits were forced to abandon the mission by 1658 as hostilities resumed, possibly because of the sudden death of 500 native people from an epidemic of [[smallpox]], a European [[infectious disease]] to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].

From 1658 to 1663, the Iroquois were at war with the Susquehannock and their [[Lenape]] and [[Province of Maryland]] allies. In 1663, a large Iroquois invasion force was defeated at the Susquehannock main fort. In 1663, the Iroquois were at war with the [[Sokoki]] tribe of the upper [[Connecticut River]]. Smallpox struck again, and through the effects of disease, famine, and war, the Iroquois were under threat of extinction. In 1664, an Oneida party struck at allies of the Susquehannock on Chesapeake Bay.

In 1665, three of the Five Nations made peace with the French. The following year, the Governor-General of New France, the Marquis de Tracy, sent the Carignan regiment under to confront the Mohawk and the Oneida.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=10}} The Mohawk avoided battle, but the French burned their villages, referred to as "castles" by the French, and crops.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=10}} In 1667, the remaining two Iroquois Nations signed a peace treaty with the French and agreed to allow their missionaries to visit their villages. The French Jesuit missionaries were known as the "black-robes" to the Iroquois, who began to urge that Catholic converts should relocate to the village of Caughnawga outside of Montreal.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=10}} This treaty lasted for 17 years.

====1670–1701====
[[File:5NationsExpansion.jpg|thumb|Iroquois conquests 1638–1711]]
Around 1670, the Iroquois drove the Siouan-speaking [[Mannahoac]] tribe out of the northern [[Virginia Piedmont]] region. They began to claim ownership of the territory by right of conquest. In 1672, the Iroquois were defeated by a war party of Susquehannock. The Iroquois appealed to the French for support and asked Governor Frontenac to assist them against the Susquehannock.

Some{{Which|date=July 2012}} old histories state that the Iroquois defeated the Susquehannock during this time period. As no record of a defeat has been found, historians have concluded that no defeat occurred.&lt;ref name="jennings135" /&gt; In 1677, the Iroquois adopted the majority of the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock into their nation.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1676, the Governor of New York colony, Edmund Andros, sent a letter to the chiefs of the Iroquois asking for their help in [[King Philip's War]] as the English colonists in New England were having much difficulty fighting the Wampanoag under the leadership of [[Metacom]].&lt;ref name="Parmenter pages 39-76"&gt;Parmenter, Jon "After the Mourning Wars: The Iroquois as Allies in Colonial North American Campaigns, 1676-1760" pages 39-76 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 64, Issue # 1, January 2007 page 42&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for guns from the English, which the Iroquois greatly valued, an Iroquois war party launched a devastating raid on the Wampanoag in February 1676, destroying villages and with them, supplies of food while taking many prisoners.&lt;ref name="Parmenter pages 39-76"/&gt;

By 1677, the Iroquois formed an alliance with the [[England|English]] through an agreement known as the [[Covenant Chain]]. By 1680, the Iroquois Confederacy was in a strong position, having eliminated the Susquehannock and the Wampanoag, taken vast number of captives to increase the size of their population, and had secured an alliance with the English that guaranteed supplies of guns and ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, Jon "After the Mourning Wars: The Iroquois as Allies in Colonial North American Campaigns, 1676-1760" pages 39-76 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 64, Issue # 1, January 2007 page 43&lt;/ref&gt; Together the allies battled to a standstill the [[France|French]], who were allied with the [[Wyandot people|Huron]]. These [[Iroquoian]] people had been a traditional and historic foe of the Confederacy. The Iroquois colonized the northern shore of Lake Ontario and sent raiding parties westward all the way to [[Illinois Country]]. The tribes of Illinois were eventually defeated, not by the Iroquois, but by the [[Potawatomi]].

In 1679, the Susquehannock, with Iroquois help, attacked Maryland's [[Piscataway Indian Nation|Piscataway]] and [[Mattawoman]] allies. Peace was not reached until 1685. During the same period, French Jesuit missionaries were active in Iroquoia, which led to a voluntary mass relocation of many Haudenosaunee to the St. Lawrence valley at [[Kahnawake]] and [[Kanesatake]] near Montreal.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Parmenter, Jon "After the Mourning Wars: The Iroquois as Allies in Colonial North American Campaigns, 1676-1760" pages 39-76 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 64, Issue # 1, January 2007 page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the intention of the French to use the Catholic Haudenosaunee in the St. Lawrence valley as a buffer to keep the Haudenosaunee allied with the English living in what is now upstate New York away from Montreal, the center of the French fur trade.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The attempts of both the English and the French to use their Haudenosaunee allies for their own purposes were foiled as the two groups of Haudenosaunee showed a "profound reluctance to kill one another".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Following the move of the Catholic Iroquois to the St. Lawrence valley, historians commonly describe the Iroquois living outside of Montreal as the Canadian Iroquois while the Iroquois who remained in the historical heartland of Iroquoia in modern upstate New York are described as the League Iroquois.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, D.

In 1684, the governor of New France, Joseph-Antoine Le Febvre de La Barre, decided to launch a punitive expedition against the Seneca, who were attacking French and Algonquian fur traders in the Mississippi river valley, and asked for the Catholic Haudenosaunee to contribute men for his expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, Jon "After the Mourning Wars: The Iroquois as Allies in Colonial North American Campaigns, 1676-1760" pages 39-76 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 64, Issue # 1, January 2007 pages 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; La Barre's expedition ended in fiasco in September 1684 when influenza broke out among the ''troupes de la Marine'' while the Canadian Iroquois warriors refused to fight, instead only engaging in verbal battles as they exchanged insults with the Seneca warriors.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Parmenter, Jon "After the Mourning Wars: The Iroquois as Allies in Colonial North American Campaigns, 1676-1760" pages 39-76 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 64, Issue # 1, January 2007 page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; King Louis XIV of France was not amused when he heard of La Barre's failure, which led him to sack La Barre as governor of New France, and sent as his replacement [[Jacques-René de Brisay de Denonville, Marquis de Denonville]], [[Governor of New France]] from 1685 to 1689, who arrived in August with orders from the king to crush the Haudenosaunee confederacy.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Parmenter, Jon "After the Mourning Wars: The Iroquois as Allies in Colonial North American Campaigns, 1676-1760" pages 39-76 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 64, Issue # 1, January 2007 page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sun King had instructed Denonville to ensure that the "grandeur" of France be respected even in the remote woods of North America.

[[File:5NationsCession.jpg|thumb|Map showing dates Iroquois claims relinquished, 1701–1796. Note: In the 1701 [[Nanfan Treaty]], the Five Nations abandoned their nominal claims to "beaver hunting" lands north of the Ohio in favor of England; however, these areas were still de facto controlled by other tribes allied with France.]] In 1684, the Iroquois invaded Virginia and Illinois territory again and unsuccessfully attacked French outposts in the latter. Trying to reduce warfare in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia, later that year, the Virginia Colony agreed in a conference at Albany to recognize the Iroquois' right to use the North-South path, known as the [[Great Warpath]], running east of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]], provided they did not intrude on the English settlements east of the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]].

In 1687, the Marquis de Denonville set out for [[Fort Frontenac]] (modern [[Kingston, Ontario]]) with a well-organized force. In July 1687 Denonville took with him on his expedition a mixed force of ''troupes de la Marine'', French-Canadian militiamen, and 353 Indian warriors from the Jesuit mission settlements, of which 220 were Haudenosaunee.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; They met with 50 hereditary [[sachem]]s from the [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] council fire, who came under a flag of truce in what on the north shore of Lake Ontario in what is now southern Ontario.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Denonville recaptured the [[fort]] for [[New France]] and seized, chained, and shipped the 50 Iroquois chiefs to [[Marseilles, France]], to be used as [[galley]] slaves.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Several of the Catholic Haudenosaunee were outraged at the way in which French enslaved a diplomatic party that had come under the flag of truce and had enslaved all of the Cayuga people living in several villages on the north shore of Lake Ontario, which led to least 100 of them to desert to the Seneca.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, Jon "After the Mourning Wars: The Iroquois as Allies in Colonial North American Campaigns, 1676-1760" pages 39-76 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 64, Issue # 1, January 2007 pages 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Denonville justified enslaving the people he encountered, saying that as an "civilized European" he did not respect the customs of "savages" and would do as he liked with them. On 13 August 1687, an advance party of French soldiers walked into a Seneca ambush and were nearly killed to a man; however the Seneca had mistaken the advance party for the main French force and fled when the main French force came up.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; The remaining Catholic Haudenosaunee warriors refused orders from Denonville to pursue the retreating Seneca.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

Denonville ravaged the land of the [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]], landing a French armada at [[Irondequoit Bay]], striking straight into the seat of Seneca power, and destroying many of its villages. Fleeing before the attack, the Seneca moved farther west, east and south down the [[Susquehanna River]]. Although great damage was done to the Seneca homeland, the Senecas' military might was not appreciably weakened. The Confederacy and the Seneca developed an alliance with the English who were settling in the east. The destruction of the Seneca land infuriated the members of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]. On August 4, 1689, they retaliated by burning to the ground [[Lachine, Quebec|Lachine]], a small town adjacent to [[Montreal]]. Fifteen hundred Iroquois warriors had been harassing Montreal defenses for many months prior to that.

They finally exhausted and defeated Denonville and his forces. His tenure was followed by the return of [[Comte de Frontenac|Frontenac]], who succeeded Denonville as Governor for the next nine years (1689–1698). Frontenac had been arranging a new plan of attack to lessen the effects of the Iroquois in North America. Realizing the danger of continuing to hold the sachems, he located the 13 surviving leaders of the 50 originally taken and returned with them to New France in October 1689. In 1690, Frontenac destroyed the village of Schenectady and in 1693 Frontenac burned down three Mohawk villages and took 300 prisoners.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=11}}

In 1696, Frontenac decided to take the field against the Iroquois, although at this time he was seventy-six years of age. Frontenac decided to target the Oneida and Onondaga this time, instead of the Mohawk whom were the favorite enemies of the French.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=11}} On July 6, he left Lachine at the head of a considerable force and traveled to the village of the Onondaga, where he arrived a month later. With support from the French, the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] nations drove the Iroquois out of the territories north of [[Lake Erie]] and west of present-day [[Cleveland, Ohio]], regions which they had conquered during the Beaver Wars.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, the Iroquois had abandoned their villages. As pursuit was impracticable, the French army commenced its return march on August 10. Under Frontenac's leadership, the Canadian militia became increasingly adept at [[guerrilla]] warfare, taking the war into Iroquois territory and attacking a number of English settlements. The Iroquois never threatened the French colony again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Frontenac et Palluau, Louis de Buade|volume=11|pages=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[King William's War]] (North American part of the [[War of the Grand Alliance]]), the Iroquois were allied with the English. In July 1701, they concluded the "[[Nanfan Treaty]]", deeding the English a large tract north of the Ohio River. The Iroquois claimed to have conquered this territory 80 years earlier. France did not recognize the validity of the treaty, as it had settlements in the territory at that time and the English had virtually none. Meanwhile, the Iroquois were negotiating peace with the French; together they signed the [[Great Peace of Montreal]] that same year.

===French and Indian Wars===
{{See also|French and Indian Wars}}

After the 1701 peace treaty with the French, the Iroquois remained mostly neutral. During the course of the 17th century, the Iroquois had acquired a fearsome reputation among the Europeans, and it was the policy of the Six Nations to use this reputation to play off the French against the British in order to extract the maximum amount of material rewards.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, Jon "After the Mourning Wars: The Iroquois as Allies in Colonial North American Campaigns, 1676-1760" pages 39-76 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 64, Issue # 1, January 2007 pages 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1689, the English Crown provided the Six Nations goods worth £100 in exchange for help against the French, in the year 1693 the Iroquois had received goods worth £600, and in the year 1701 the Six Nations had received goods worth £800.&lt;ref&gt;Parmenter, Jon "After the Mourning Wars: The Iroquois as Allies in Colonial North American Campaigns, 1676-1760" pages 39-76 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 64, Issue # 1, January 2007 page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Queen Anne's War]] (North American part of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]), they were involved in planned attacks against the French. [[Peter Schuyler]], mayor of Albany, arranged for three Mohawk chiefs and a Mahican chief (known incorrectly as the [[Four Mohawk Kings]]) to travel to London in 1710 to meet with [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in an effort to seal an alliance with the British. Queen Anne was so impressed by her visitors that she commissioned their portraits by court painter [[John Verelst]]. The portraits are believed to be the earliest surviving oil portraits of Aboriginal peoples taken from life.&lt;ref name="4kings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/4-kings/index-e.html |title=The Four Indian Kings |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mohawk-kings.jpg|frame|center|The four "Mohawk Kings" who travelled to London in 1710.]]

In the first quarter of the 18th century, the Iroquoian-speaking [[Tuscarora (tribe)#Subsequent History|Tuscarora]] fled north from the pressure of [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]] of [[North Carolina#History|North Carolina]] and intertribal warfare; they had been subject to having captives sold into [[Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian slavery]]. They petitioned to become the sixth nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. This was a non-voting position, but they gained the protection of the Haudenosaunee.

The Iroquois program toward the defeated tribes favored assimilation within the 'Covenant Chain' and Great Law of Peace, over wholesale slaughter. Both the Lenni Lenape, and the Shawnee were briefly tributary to the Six Nations, while subjected Iroquoian populations emerged in the next period as the [[Mingo]], speaking a dialect like that of the Seneca, in the Ohio region. During the War of Spanish Succession, known to Americans as "Queen Anne's War", the Iroquois remained neutral, through leaning towards the British.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=11}} Anglican missionaries were active with the Iroquois and devised a system of writing for them.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=11}}

[[File:Iroquois western goods.jpg|thumb|Iroquois engaging in trade with Europeans, 1722]]
In 1721 and 1722, Lt. Governor [[Alexander Spotswood]] of Virginia concluded a new [http://earlytreaties.unl.edu/treaty.00001.html Treaty at Albany] with the Iroquois, renewing the Covenant Chain and agreeing to recognize the Blue Ridge as the demarcation between the Virginia Colony and the Iroquois. But, as European settlers began to move beyond the Blue Ridge and into the [[Shenandoah Valley]] in the 1730s, the Iroquois objected. Virginia officials told them that the demarcation was to prevent the Iroquois from trespassing ''east'' of the Blue Ridge, but it did not prevent English from expanding ''west.'' Tensions increased over the next decades, and the Iroquois were on the verge of going to war with the Virginia Colony. In 1743, Governor [[Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet|Gooch]] paid them the sum of 100 pounds sterling for any settled land in the Valley that was claimed by the Iroquois. The following year at the [[Treaty of Lancaster]], the Iroquois sold Virginia all their remaining claims in the Shenandoah Valley for 200 pounds in gold.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Solomon Walton, 1900, ''Conrad Weiser and the Indian Policy of Colonial Pennsylvania,'' pp. 76-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French and Indian War]] (the North American theater of the [[Seven Years' War]]), the League Iroquois sided with the British against the French and their Algonquian allies, who were traditional enemies. The Iroquois hoped that aiding the British would also bring favors after the war. Few Iroquois warriors joined the campaign. By contrast, the Canadian Iroquois supported the French.

In 1711, refugees from is now southern-western Germany known as the Palatines appealed to the Iroquois clan mothers for permission to settle on their land.{{sfn|Paxton|2008|p=12}} By spring of 1713, about 150 Palatine families had leased land from the Iroquois.{{sfn|Paxton|2008|p=13}} The Iroquois taught the Palatines how to grow "the Three Sisters" as they called their staple crops of beans, corn and squash and where to find edible nuts, roots and berries.{{sfn|Paxton|2008|p=13}} In return, the Palatines taught the Iroquois how to grow wheat and oats, and how to use iron ploughs and hoes to farm.{{sfn|Paxton|2008|p=13}} As a result of the money earned from land rented to the Palatines, the Iroquois elite gave up living in longhouses and started living in European style houses, having an income equal to a middle-class English family.{{sfn|Paxton|2008|p=13}} By the middle of the 18th century, a multi-cultural world had emerged with the Iroquois living alongside German and Scots-Irish settlers.{{sfn|Paxton|2008|p=14}} The settlements of the Palatines were intermixed with the Iroquois villages.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=12}} In 1738, an Irishman, William Johnson, who was successful as a fur trader, settled with the Iroquois.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=12-13}} Johnson who become very rich from the fur trade and land speculation, learned the languages of the Iroquois while bedding as many of their women as possible, and become the main intermediary between the British and the League.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=12-13}} In 1745, Johnson was appointed the Northern superintendent of Indian Affairs, formalizing his position.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=13}}

On 9 July 1755, a force of British Army regulars and the Virginia militia under General Edward Braddock advancing into the Ohio river valley was almost completely destroyed by the French and their Indian allies at the Battle of the Monongahela.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=13}} Johnson, who had the task of enlisting the League Iroquois on the British side, led a mixed Anglo-Iroquois force to victory at Lac du St Sacrement, known to the British as Lake George.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=13}} In the [[Battle of Lake George]], a group of Catholic Mohawk (from ''[[Kahnawake]]'') and French forces ambushed a Mohawk-led British column; the Mohawk were deeply disturbed as they had created their confederacy for peace among the peoples and had not had warfare against each other. Johnson attempted to ambush a force of 1,000 French troops and 700 Canadian Iroquios under the command of Baron Dieskau, who beat off the attack and killed the old Mohawk war chief, Peter Hendricks.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=13}} On 8 September 1755, Diskau attacked Johnson's camp, but was repulsed with heavy losses.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=13}} Though the Battle of Lake George was a British victory, the heavy losses taken by the Mohawk and Oneida at the battle caused the League to declare neutrality in the war.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=13}} Despite Johnson's best efforts, the League Iroquois remained neutral for next several years, and a series of French victories at Oswego, Louisbourg, Fort William Henry and Fort Carillon ensured the League Iroquois would not fight on what appeared to be the losing side.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=14}}

In February 1756, the French learned from a spy, Oratory, an Oneida chief, that a British were stockpiling supplies at the [[Oneida Carry|Oneida Carrying Place]], a crucial portage between Albany and Oswego to support an offensive in the spring into what is now Ontario.&lt;ref name="MacLeod, D. Peter page 23"&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As the frozen waters melted south of Lake Ontario on average two weeks before the waters did north of Lake Ontario, the British would be able to move against the French bases at Fort Frontenac and Fort Niagara before the French forces in Montreal could come to their relief, which from the French perspective necessitated a preemptive strike at the Oneida Carrying Place in the winter.&lt;ref name="MacLeod, D. Peter page 23"/&gt; To carry out this strike, [[Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial|the Marquis de Vaudreuil]], the Governor-General of New France, assigned the task to Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry, an officer of the ''troupes de le Marine'', who required and received the assistance of the Canadian Iroquois to guide him to the Oneida Carrying Place.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 pages 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Iroquois joined the expedition, which left Montreal on 29 February 1756 on the understanding that they would only fight against the British, not the League Iroquois, and they would not be assaulting a fort.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 pages 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 1756, an Oswegatchie Indian traveler informed the expedition that the British had built two forts at the Oneida Carrying Place, which caused the majority of the Canadian Iroquois to want to turn back, as they argued the risks of assaulting a fort would mean too many casualties, and many did in fact abandon the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 1756, Léry's force of ''troupes de le Marine'' and French-Canadian militiamen, who had not eaten for two days, received much needed food when the Canadian Iroquois ambushed a British wagon train bringing supplies to Fort William and Fort Bull.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; As far as the Canadian Iroquois were concerned, the raid was a success as they captured 9 wagons full of supplies and took 10 prisoners without losing a man, and for them, engaging in a frontal attack against the two wooden forts as Léry wanted to do was irrational.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 pages 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Iroquois informed Léry "if I absolutely wanted to die, I was the master of the French, but they were not going to follow me".&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, about 30 Canadian Iroquois reluctantly joined Léry's attack on Fort Bull on the morning of 27 March 1756, when the French and their Indian allies stormed the fort, finally smashing their way in through the main gate with a battering ram at noon.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 pages 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 63 people in Fort Bull, half of whom were civilians, only 3 soldiers, one carpenter and one woman survived the [[Battle of Fort Bull]] as Léry reported "I could not restrain the ardor of the soldiers and the ''Canadians''. They killed everyone they encountered".&lt;ref name="MacLeod, D. Peter page 32"&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the French destroyed all of the British supplies and Fort Bull itself, which secured the western flank of New France.&lt;ref name="MacLeod, D. Peter page 32"/&gt; On the same day, the main force of the Canadian Iroquois ambushed a relief force from Fort William coming to the aid of Fort Bull, and did not slaughter their prisoners as the French did at Fort Bull; for the Iroquois, prisoners were very valuable as they increased the size of the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 pages 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crucial difference between the European and First Nations way of war was that Europe had millions of people, which meant that British and French generals were willing to see thousands of their own men die in battle in order to secure victory as their losses could always be made good; by contrast, the Iroquois had a considerably smaller population, and could not afford heavy losses, which could cripple a community. The Iroquois custom of "Mourning wars" to take captives who would become Iroquois reflected the continual need for more people in the Iroquois communities. Iroquois warriors were brave, but would only fight to the death if necessary, usually to protect their women and children; otherwise, the crucial concern for Iroquois chiefs was always to save manpower.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian historian D. Peter MacLeod wrote that the Iroquois way of war was based on their hunting philosophy, where a successful hunter would bring down an animal efficiently without taking any losses to his hunting party, and in the same way, a successful war leader would inflict losses on the enemy without taking any losses in return.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, D. Peter ''The Canadian Iroquois and the Seven Years' War'', Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2012 page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iroquois only entered the war on the British side again in late 1758 after the British took Louisbourg and Fort Frontenac.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=14}} At the Treaty of Fort Easton in October 1758, the Iroquois forced the Lenape and Shawnee who had been fighting for the French to declare neutrality.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=14}} In July 1759, the Iroquois helped Johnson take Fort Niagara.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=14}} In the ensuing campaign, the League Iroquois assisted General Jeffrey Amherst as he took various French forts by the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence valley as he advanced towards Montreal, which he took in September 1760.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=14}} The British historian Michael Johnson wrote the Iroquois had "played a major supporting role" in the final British victory in the Seven Years' War.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=14}} In 1763, Johnson left his old home of Fort Johnson for the lavish estate, which he called Johnson Hall, which become a center of social life in the region.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=14}} Johnson was close to two white families, the Butlers and the Croghans, and three Mohawk families, the Brants, the Hills, and the Peters.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=14}}

After the war, to protect their alliance, the British government issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], forbidding Anglo-European (white) settlements beyond the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Colonists largely ignored the order, and the British had insufficient soldiers to enforce it.

Faced with confrontations, the Iroquois agreed to adjust the line again in the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] (1768). [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet]], British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Northern District, had called the Iroquois nations together in a grand conference in western New York, which a total of 3,102 Indians attended.&lt;ref name="brookhiser"/&gt; They had long had good relations with Johnson, who had traded with them and learned their languages and customs. As [[Alan Taylor (historian)|Alan Taylor]] noted in his history, ''The Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution'' (2006), the Iroquois were creative and strategic thinkers. They chose to sell to the British Crown all their remaining claim to the lands between the Ohio and Tennessee rivers, which they did not occupy, hoping by doing so to draw off English pressure on their territories in the Province of New York.&lt;ref name="brookhiser"/&gt;

===American Revolution===
[[File:Joseph Brant (Mohawk) by Charles Bird King.jpg|thumb|[[Lithograph]] of the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] war and political leader Thayendanegea or [[Joseph Brant]]]]
During the [[American Revolution]], the Iroquois first tried to stay neutral. The Reverend Samuel Kirkland, a Congregational minister working as a missionary, pressured the Oneida and the Tuscarora for a pro-American neutrality while Guy Johnson and his cousin John Johnson pressured the Mohawk, the Cayuga and the Seneca to fight for the British.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=15}}  Pressed to join one side or the other, the Tuscarora and the Oneida sided with the colonists, while the Mohawk, Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga remained loyal to Great Britain, with whom they had stronger relationships. [[Joseph Louis Cook]] offered his services to the United States and received a Congressional commission as a lieutenant colonel—the highest rank held by any Native American during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov/bia/docs/oneida_deis_aug2806/Section3.6DEISAugust28th,2006.pdf Oneida Nation of New York Conveyance of Lands Into Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420112109/http://www.doi.gov/bia/docs/oneida_deis_aug2806/Section3.6DEISAugust28th%2C2006.pdf |date=2009-04-20 }} pp. 3-159, Department of Indian Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant together with John Butler and John Johnson raised racially mixed forces of irregulars to fight for the Crown.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=15}-16}} [[Molly Brant]] had been the common-law wife of Sir William Johnson, and it was through her patronage that her brother Joseph came to be a war chief.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=16}}

The Mohawk war chief [[Joseph Brant]], other war chiefs, and British allies conducted numerous operations against frontier settlements in the Mohawk Valley, including the [[Cherry Valley massacre]], destroying many villages and crops, and killing and capturing inhabitants. The destructive raids by Brant and other Loyalists led to appeals to Congress for help.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=16}} The Continentals retaliated and in 1779, [[George Washington]] ordered the [[Sullivan Campaign]], led by Col. [[Daniel Brodhead IV|Daniel Brodhead]] and General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]], against the Iroquois nations to "not merely overrun, but destroy", the British-Indian alliance. They burned many Iroquois villages and stores throughout western New York; refugees moved north to Canada. By the end of the war, few houses and barns in the valley had survived the warfare. In the aftermath of the Sullivan expedition, Brant visited Quebec City to ask General Sir Frederick Haildmand for assurances that the Mohawk and the other Loyalist Iroquois would receive a new homeland in Canada as compensation for their loyalty to the Crown if the British should lose.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=16}}

The American Revolution was a war that caused a great divide amongst the colonists between Patriots and Loyalists; it caused a divide between the colonies and Great Britain, and it also caused a rift that would break the Iroquois Confederacy. At the onset of the Revolution, the Iroquois Confederacy's Six Nations attempted to take a stance of neutrality. However, almost inevitably, the Iroquois nations eventually had to take sides in the conflict. It is easy to see how the American Revolution would have caused conflict and confusion among the Six Nations. For years they had been used to thinking about the English and their colonists as one and the same people. In the American Revolution, the Iroquois Confederacy now had to deal with relationships between two governments.&lt;ref name="Graymont, Barbara 1972"&gt;Graymont, Barbara. The Iroquois In The American Revolution. Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 1972. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iroquois Confederation's population had changed significantly since the arrival of Europeans. Disease had reduced their population to a fraction of what it had been in the past.&lt;ref name="Crawford, Neta 1994"&gt;Crawford, Neta. "A Security Regime among Democracies: Cooperation among Iroquois Nations." International Organization 48 (1994): 345-85. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it was in their best interest to be on the good side of whoever would prove to be the winning side in the war, for the winning side would dictate how future relationships would be with the Iroquois in North America. Dealing with two governments made it hard to maintain a neutral stance, because the governments could get jealous easily if the Confederacy was interacting or trading more with one side over the other, or even if there was simply a perception of favoritism. Because of this challenging situation, the Six Nations had to choose sides. The Oneida and Tuscarora decided to support the American colonists, while the rest of the Iroquois League (the Cayuga, Mohawk, Onondaga, and Seneca) sided with the British and their Loyalists among the colonists.

There were many reasons that the Six Nations could not remain neutral and uninvolved in the Revolutionary War. One of these is simple proximity; the Iroquois Confederacy was too close to the action of the war to not be involved. The Six Nations were very discontented with the encroachment of the English and their colonists upon their land. They were particularly concerned with the border established in the Proclamation of 1763 and the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768.&lt;ref name="Del Papa 1975"&gt;Del Papa, Eugene M. "The Royal Proclamation of 1763: Its Effect upon Virginia Land Companies." The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 83 (1975): 406-11. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the American Revolution, the authority of the British government over the frontier was highly contested. The colonists tried to take advantage of this as much as possible by seeking their own profit and claiming new land. In 1775, the Six Nations were still neutral when "a Mohawk person was killed by a Continental soldier".&lt;ref name="Crawford, Neta 1994"/&gt;{{rp|370}} Such a case shows how the Six Nations' proximity to the war drew them into it. They were concerned about being killed, and about their lands being taken from them. They could not show weakness and simply let the colonists and British do whatever they wanted. Many of the English and colonists did not respect the treaties made in the past.  "A number of His Majesty's subjects in the American colonies viewed the proclamation as a temporary prohibition which would soon give way to the opening of the area for settlement ... and that it was simply an agreement to quiet the minds of the Indians".&lt;ref name="Del Papa 1975"/&gt; The Six Nations had to take a stand to show that they would not accept such treatment, and they looked to build a relationship with a government that would respect their territory.

In addition to being in close proximity to the war, the new lifestyle and economics of the Iroquois Confederacy since the arrival of the Europeans in North America made it nearly impossible for the Iroquois to isolate themselves from the conflict. By this time, the Iroquois had become dependent upon the trade of goods from the English and colonists, and had adopted many European customs, tools, and weapons. For example, they were increasingly dependent on firearms for hunting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Graymont, Barbara. The Iroquois In The American Revolution. Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 1972. Print&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming so reliant, it would have been hard to even consider cutting off trade that brought goods that were a central part of everyday life.

As Barbara Graymont stated, "Their task was an impossible one to maintain neutrality. Their economies and lives had become so dependent on each other for trading goods and benefits it was impossible to ignore the conflict. Meanwhile they had to try and balance their interactions with both groups. They did not want to seem as they were favoring one group over the other, because of sparking jealousy and suspicion from either side". Furthermore, the English had made many agreements with the Six Nations over the years, yet most of the Iroquois' day-to-day interaction had been with the colonists. This made it a confusing situation for the Iroquois because they could not tell who the true heirs of the agreement were, and couldn't know if agreements with England would continue to be honored by the colonists if they were to win independence.

Supporting either side in the Revolutionary War was a complicated decision. Each nation individually weighed their options to come up with a final stance that ultimately broke neutrality and ended the collective agreement of the Confederation. The British were clearly the most organized, and seemingly most powerful. In many cases, the British presented the situation to the Iroquois as the colonists just being "naughty children". On the other, the Iroquois considered that "the British government was three thousand miles away. This placed them at a disadvantage in attempting to enforce both the Proclamation of 1763 and the Treaty at Fort Stanwix 1768 against land hungry frontiersmen."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;{{rp|49}} In other words, even though the British were the strongest and best organized faction, the Six Nations had concerns about whether they would truly be able to enforce their agreements from so far away.

The Iroquois also had concerns about the colonists. The British asked for Iroquois support in the war. "In 1775, the Continental Congress sent a delegation to the Iroquois in Albany to ask for their neutrality in the war coming against the British".&lt;ref name="Crawford, Neta 1994"/&gt;{{rp|370}} It had been clear in prior years that the colonists had not been respectful of the land agreements made in 1763 and 1768. The Iroquois Confederacy was particularly concerned over the possibility of the colonists winning the war, for if a revolutionary victory were to occur, the Iroquois very much saw it as the precursor to their lands being taken away by the victorious colonists, who would no longer have the British Crown to restrain them.&lt;ref name=MorganLH&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Lewis Henry|title=The League of the Iroquois|date=1995|publisher=JG Press|location=North Dighton, MA|isbn=1572151242}}. Note: reprint of 1904 book, [https://archive.org/details/hodenosaunee00morgrich League of the Ho-dé-no-sau-nee or Iroquois]&lt;/ref&gt; Continental army officers such as George Washington had attempted to destroy the Iroquois.&lt;ref name="Crawford, Neta 1994"/&gt;

On a contrasting note, it was the colonists who had formed the most direct relationships with the Iroquois due to their proximity and trade ties. For the most part, the colonists and Iroquois had lived in relative peace since the English arrival on the continent a century and a half before. The Iroquois had to determine whether their relationships with the colonists were reliable, or whether the English would prove to better serve their interests. They also had to determine whether there were really any differences between how the English and the colonists would treat them.

The war ensued, and the Iroquois broke their confederation. Hundreds of years of precedent and collective government was trumped by the immensity of the American Revolutionary War. The Oneida and Tuscarora decided to support the colonists, while the rest of the Iroquois League (the Cayuga, Mohawk, Onondaga, and Seneca) sided with the British and Loyalists. At the conclusion of the war the fear that the colonists would not respect the Iroquois' pleas came true, especially after the majority of the Six Nations decided to side with the British and were no longer considered trustworthy by the newly independent Americans. In 1783 the Treaty of Paris was signed. While the treaty included peace agreements between all of the European nations involved in the war as well as the newborn United States, it made no provisions for the Iroquois, who were left to be treated with by the new United States government as it saw fit.&lt;ref name="Graymont, Barbara 1972"/&gt;

===Post-war===
After the Revolutionary War, the ancient central fireplace of the League was re-established at [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]]. The United States and the Iroquois signed the treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1784 under which the Iroquois ceded much of their historical homeland to the Americans, which was followed by another treaty in 1794 at Canandaigua which they ceded even more land to the Americans.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=17}} The governor of New York state, [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], was constantly pressuring the Iroquois to sell their land to white settlers, and as alcoholism became a major problem in the Iroquois communities, many did sell their land in order to buy more alcohol, usually to unscrupulous agents of land companies.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=16-18}} At the same time, American settlers continued to push into the lands beyond the Ohio river, leading to a war between the Western Confederacy and the United States.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=17}} One of the Iroquois chiefs, Cornplanter, persuaded the remaining Iroquois in New York state to remain neutral and not to join the Western Confederacy.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=17}} At the same time, American policies to make the Iroquois more settled started to have some effect. Traditionally, for the Iroquois farming was woman's work and hunting was men's work; by the early 19th century, American policies to have the men farm the land and cease hunting were having effect.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=19}} During this time, the Iroquois living in New York state become demoralized  as more of their land was sold to land speculators while alcoholism, violence, and broken families became major problems on their reservations.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=19}} The Oneida and the Cayuga sold almost all of their land and moved out of their traditional homelands.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=19}}

By 1811, Methodist and Episcopalian missionaries established missions to assist the Oneida and Onondaga in western New York. However, white settlers continued to move into the area. By 1821, a group of Oneida led by [[Eleazar Williams]], son of a Mohawk woman, went to Wisconsin to buy land from the [[Menominee]] and [[Ho-Chunk]] and thus move their people further westward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Julia |last=Keen Bloomfield|title= The Oneidas |year=1908|page= 145 et seq|url=https://books.google.com/books/reader?id=Yow-AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;pg=GBS.PA326}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1838, the Holland Land Company used forged documents to cheat the Seneca of almost all of their land in western New York, but a Quaker missionary, Asher Wright, launched lawsuits that led to one of the Seneca reservations being returned in 1842 and another in 1857.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=19}} However, as late as the 1950s both the United States and New York governments confiscated land belonging to the Six Nations for roads, dams and reservoirs with the land being given to Cornplanter for keeping the Iroquois from joining the Western Confederacy in the 1790s being confiscated and flooded by the Kinzua Dam.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=19}} 
 
Captain Joseph Brant and a group of Iroquois left [[New York (state)|New York]] to settle in [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|the Province of Quebec]] (present-day [[Ontario]]). To partially replace the lands they had lost in the Mohawk Valley and elsewhere because of their fateful alliance with the British Crown, they were [[Haldimand Proclamation|given a large land grant]] on the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]], at [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation]]. Brant's crossing of the river gave the original name to the area: Brant's Ford. By 1847, European settlers began to settle nearby and named the village [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]]. The original Mohawk settlement was on the south edge of the present-day Canadian city at a location still favorable for launching and landing canoes. In the 1830s many additional Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca, Cayuga, and Tuscarora relocated into the [[Indian Territory]], the Province of [[Upper Canada]], and [[Wisconsin]].

===In the West===
Many Iroquois (mostly Mohawk) and Iroquois-descended [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis people]] living in [[Lower Canada]] (primarily at [[Kahnawake]]) took employment with the Montreal-based [[North West Company]] during its existence from 1779 to 1821 and became [[voyageurs]] or [[moutain man|free traders]] working in the [[North American fur trade]] as far west as the Rocky Mountains. They are known to have settled in the area around [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper's House]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalalbertamuseum.ca/onlineExhibit/southesk/rockyMountains_waniyandes.cfm|title=Southesk|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310174503/http://www.royalalbertamuseum.ca/onlineExhibit/southesk/rockyMountains_waniyandes.cfm|archivedate=2014-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly as far west as the [[Finlay River]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calverley.ca/Part01-FirstNations/01-039.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417060640/http://www.calverley.ca/Part01-FirstNations/01-039.html |archivedate=2014-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and north as far as the [[Pouce Coupe]] and [[Dunvegan Provincial Park|Dunvegan]] areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calverley.ca/Part01-FirstNations/01-040.html|title=THE IROQUOIS IN THE PEACE RIVER AREA|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417065214/http://www.calverley.ca/Part01-FirstNations/01-040.html|archivedate=2014-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they founded new Aboriginal communities which have persisted to the present day claiming either First Nations or Métis identity and indigenous rights. The [[Michel Band]], [[Mountain Métis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainmetis.com/pages/our_story.html|title=Mountain Métis Story|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseniwuche.com/our_story/ancestral_history.html|title=Ancestral History - Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada - Canada's Rocky Mountain Aboriginal People|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Alberta and the [[Kelly Lake, British Columbia|Kelly Lake]] community in British Columbia all claim Iroquois ancestry.

===The Canadian Iroquois===
During the 18th century, the Catholic Canadian Iroquois living outside of Montreal reestablished ties with the League Iroquois.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=20}} During the American Revolution, the Canadian Iroquois declared their neutrality and refused to fight for the Crown despite the offers of Sir [[Guy Carlton]], the governor of Quebec.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=20}} Many Canadian Iroquois worked for the both Hudson's Bay Company and the Northwest Company as a ''voyageurs'' in the fur trade in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=20}} In the War of 1812, the Canadian Iroquois again declared their neutrality.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=20}} The Canadian Iroquois communities at Oka and Kahnaweke were prosperous settlements in the 19th century, supporting themselves via farming and the sale of sleds, snowshoes, boats, and baskets.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=20}} In 1884, about 100 Canadian Iroquois were hired by the British government to serve as river pilots and boatmen for the relief expedition for the besieged General Charles Gordon in Khartoum in the Sudan, taking the force commanded by Field Marshal Wolsely up the Nile from Cairo to Khartoum.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=20}} On their way back to Canada, the Canadian Iroquois river pilots and boatmen stopped in London, where they were personally thanked by Queen Victoria for their services to Queen and Country.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=20}} In 1886, when a bridge was being built at the St. Lawrence, a number of Iroquois men from Kahnawke were hired to help built and the Iroquois workers proved so skilled as steelwork erectors that since that time, a number of bridges and skycrapers in Canada and the United States have been built by the Iroquois steelmen.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=20}}

==20th century==

===World War I===
During World War I, it was Canadian policy to encourage men from the First Nations to enlist in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] (CEF), where their skills at hunting made them excellent as snipers and scouts.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=6}} As the Iroquois Six Nations were considered to be the most warlike of all Canada's First Nations, and in turn, the Mohawk were considered to the most warlike of all the Six Nations, the government especially encouraged the Iroquois and above all the Mohawks to join the CEF.{{sfn|Winegard||2012|p=30}} About the half of the 4, 000 or so First Nations men who served in the CEF were Iroquois.{{sfn|Winegard|2012|p=76-77}} Men from the Six Nations reservation at Brantford were encouraged to join the 114th Haldimand Battalion (also known as "Brock's Rangers) of the CEF, where two entire companies including the officers were all Iroquois.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=6}} The 114th Battalion was formed in December 1915 and broken up in November 1916 to provide reinforcements for other battalions.{{sfn|Chartrand|2007|p=6}} Iroquois captured by the Germans were often subjected to cruel treatment. A Mohawk from Brantford, William Forster Lickers, who enlisted in the CEF in September 1914 was captured at the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915, where he was savagely beaten by his captors as one German officer wanted to see if "Indians could feel pain".{{sfn|Winegard|2012|p=112}} Lickers was beaten so badly that he was left paralyzed for the rest of his life, through the officer was well pleased to establish that Indians did indeed feel pain.{{sfn|Winegard|2012|p=112}}

The Six Nations council at Brantford tended to see themselves as a sovereign nation that was allied to the Crown through the Covenant Chain going back to the 17th century and thus allied to King George V personally instead of being under the authority of Canada.{{sfn|Winegard|2012|p=128}} One Iroquois clan mother in a letter sent in August 1916 to a recruiting sergeant who refused to allow her teenage son to join the CEF under the grounds that he was underage, declared the Six Nations were not subject to the laws of Canada and he had no right to refuse her son because Canadian laws did not apply to them.{{sfn|Winegard|2012|p=128}} As she explained, the Iroquois regarded the Covenant Chain as still being in effect, meaning the Iroquois were only fighting in the war because they were allied to the Crown and were responding to an appeal for help from their ally, King George V, who had asked them to enlist in the CEF.{{sfn|Winegard|2012|p=128}}

===League of Nations===
The complex political environment which emerged in [[Canada]] with the Haudenosaunee grew out of the Anglo-American era of European colonization. At the end of the [[War of 1812]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] shifted Indian affairs from the military to civilian control. With the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, civil authority, and thus Indian affairs, passed to Canadian officials with Britain retaining control of military and security matters. At the turn of the century, the Canadian government began passing a series of Acts which were strenuously objected to by the Iroquois Confederacy. During World War I, an act attempted to conscript Six Nations men for military service. Under the Soldiers Resettlement Act, legislation was introduced to redistribute native land. Finally in 1920, an Act was proposed to force citizenship on "Indians" with or without their consent, which would then automatically remove their share of any tribal lands from tribal trust and make the land and the person subject to the laws of Canada.&lt;ref name="Woo (2003)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woo|first1=Grace Li Xiu|title=Canada's Forgotten Founders: The Modern Significance of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Application for Membership in the League of Nations|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/lgd/2003_1/woo/|publisher=Law Social Justice &amp; Global Development Journal|accessdate=27 December 2014|date=30 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haudenosaunee hired a lawyer to defend their rights in the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court refused to take the case, declaring that the members of the Six Nations were British citizens. In effect, as Canada was at the time a division of the British government, it was not an international state, as defined by international law. In contrast, the Iroquois Confederacy had been making treaties and functioning as a state since 1643 and all of their treaties had been negotiated with Britain, not Canada.&lt;ref name="Woo (2003)" /&gt; As a result, a decision was made in 1921 to send a delegation to petition the King of England,&lt;ref name="Léger (1994)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=edited by Marie Léger; translated by Arnold|title=Aboriginal peoples : toward self-government|date=1994|publisher=Black Rose Books|location=Montréal|isbn=1-551640-11-2|pages=3–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGRVxZ0ZAt8C|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon Canada's External Affairs division blocked issuing passports. In response, the Iroquois began issuing their own passports and sent [[Levi General]],&lt;ref name="Woo (2003)" /&gt; the Cayuga Chief "Deskaheh,"&lt;ref name="Léger (1994)"/&gt; to England with their attorney. [[Winston Churchill]] dismissed their complaint claiming that it was within the realm of Canadian jurisdiction and referred them back to Canadian officials.

On 4 December 1922, [[Charles Stewart (Canadian politician)|Charles Stewart]], Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and [[Duncan Campbell Scott]], Deputy Superintendent of the [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Canadian Department of Indian Affairs]] traveled to Brantford to negotiate a settlement on the issues with the Six Nations. After the meeting, the Native delegation brought the offer to the tribal council, as was customary under Haudenosaunee law. The council agreed to accept the offer, but before they could respond, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] conducted a liquor raid on the Iroquois' Grand River territory. The siege lasted three days&lt;ref name="Woo (2003)" /&gt; and prompted the Haudenosaunee to send Deskaheh to Washington, DC, to meet with the chargé d'affaires of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] asking the Dutch Queen to sponsor them for membership in the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref name="Léger (1994)"/&gt; Under pressure from the British, the Netherlands reluctantly refused sponsorship.&lt;ref name="Un Chicanery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Un Chicanery|url=http://mohawknationnews.com/blog/2013/04/24/un-chicanery/|website=mohawknationnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deskaheh and the tribal attorney proceeded to [[Geneva]] and attempted to gather support. "On 27 September 1923, delegates representing [[Estonia]], [[Irish Free State|Ireland]], [[Panama]] and [[Sublime State of Persia|Persia]] signed a letter asking for communication of the Six Nations' petition to the League's assembly," but the effort was blocked.&lt;ref name="Woo (2003)" /&gt; Six Nations delegates traveled to the Hague and back to Geneva attempting to gain supporters and recognition,&lt;ref name="Léger (1994)"/&gt; while back in Canada, the government was drafting a mandate to replace the traditional Haudenosaunee Confederacy Council with one that would be elected under the auspices of the Canadian [[Indian Act]]. In an unpublicized signing on 17 September 1924, Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]] and Governor-General [[Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy|Lord Byng of Vimy]] signed the Order in Council, which set elections on the Six Nations reserve for 21 October. Only 26 ballots were cast.

The long-term effect of the Order was that the Canadian government had wrested control over the Haudenosaunee trust funds from the Iroquois Confederation and decades of litigation would follow.&lt;ref name="Woo (2003)" /&gt; In 1979, over 300 Indian chiefs visited London to oppose [[Patriation]] of the Canadian Constitution, fearing that their rights to be recognized in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 would be jeopardized. In 1981, hoping again to clarify that judicial responsibilities of treaties signed with Britain were not transferred to Canada, several Alberta Indian chiefs filed a petition with the British High Court of Justice. They lost the case but gained an invitation from the Canadian government to participate in the constitutional discussions which dealt with protection of treaty rights.&lt;ref name="Léger (1994)"/&gt;

===Oka Crisis===
In 1990, a long-running dispute over ownership of land at Oka, Quebec caused a violent stand-off. The Mohawk reservation at Oka had become dominated by a group called the Mohawk Warrior Society that emerged in smuggling across the U.S-Canada border and were well armed with assault rifles. On 11 July 1990, the Mohawk Warrior Society tried to stop the building of a golf course on land claimed by the Mohawk people, which led to a shoot-out between the Warrior Society and the ''Sûreté du Québec'' left a policeman dead.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} In the resulting [[Oka Crisis]], the Warrior Society occupied both the land that they claimed belonged to the Mohawk people and the Mercier bridge linking Montreal to the mainland.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} On 17 August 1990, Quebec Premier [[Robert Bourassa]] asked for the Canadian Army to intervene to maintain "public safety", leading to the deployment of the Royal 22&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Régiment to Oka and Montreal.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} The stand-off ended on 26 September 1990 with a melee between the soldiers and the warriors.{{sfn|Morton|1999|p=273}} The dispute over ownership of the land at Oka continues.

===US Indian termination policies===
''See: [[Indian termination policy|Indian Termination Policy]]''

In the period between [[World War II]] and [[The Sixties]] the US government followed a policy of [[Indian termination policy|Indian Termination]] for its Native citizens. In a series of laws, attempting to mainstream tribal people into the greater society, the government strove to end the U.S. government's recognition of tribal sovereignty, eliminate trusteeship over Indian reservations, and implement state law applicability to native persons. In general the laws were expected to create taxpaying citizens, subject to state and federal taxes as well as laws, from which Native people had previously been exempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/native_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=96 |title=U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 108, 83rd Congress, 1953.

On 13 August 1946 the [[Indian Claims Commission]] Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-726, ch. 959, was passed. Its purpose was to settle for all time any outstanding grievances or claims the tribes might have against the U.S. for treaty breaches, unauthorized taking of land, dishonorable or unfair dealings, or inadequate compensation. Claims had to be filed within a five-year period, and most of the 370 complaints that were submitted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/enrd/3147.htm|title=USDOJ: Environment and Natural Resources Division : Lead up to the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were filed at the approach of the 5-year deadline in August, 1951.&lt;ref name="Philip (2002)" &gt;{{harvnb|Philip (2002)|pp=21–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 1948 Congress enacted [Public Law 881] 62 Stat. 1224, which transferred criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by and against "Indians" to the State of New York. It covered all reservations lands within the state and prohibited the deprivation of hunting and fishing rights which may have been guaranteed to "any Indian tribe, band, or community, or members thereof." It further prohibited the state from requiring tribal members to obtain fish and game licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0427b.html#p427b|title=CONTENTdm|website=digital.library.okstate.edu|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within 2 years, Congress passed [Public Law 785] 64 Stat. 845, on 13 September 1950&lt;ref name="digital.library.okstate.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0518.html#p518a|title=CONTENTdm|website=digital.library.okstate.edu|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which extended New York's authority to civil disputes between Indians or Indians and others within the State. It allowed the tribes to preserve customs, prohibited taxation on reservations,&lt;ref name="Shattuck (1991)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymFLjaBFXqwC&amp;lpg|title= The Oneida Land Claims: A Legal History |first=George C. |last=Shattuck |publisher=Syracuse University Press |date=1991| pages = 168–169 |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaffirmed hunting and fishing rights. It also prohibited the state from enforcing judgments regarding any land disputes or applying any State Laws to tribal lands or claims prior to the effective date of the law 13 September 1952.&lt;ref name="digital.library.okstate.edu"/&gt; During congressional hearings on the law, tribes strongly opposed the passage, fearful that states would deprive them of their reservations. The State of New York disavowed any intention to break up or deprive tribes of their reservations and asserted that they did not have the ability to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shattuck (1991)|p. 169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 1953, [[United States Congress]] issued a formal statement, [[House concurrent resolution 108|House Concurrent Resolution 108]], which was the formal policy presentation announcing the official federal policy of Indian termination. The resolution called for the "immediate termination of the [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead]], [[Klamath people|Klamath]], [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Turtle Mountain Chippewa]], as well as all tribes in the states of [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Florida]], and [[Texas]]."  All federal aid, services, and protection offered to Native people were to cease, and the federal trust relationship and management of reservations would end.&lt;ref name="bloodstruggle"&gt;Wilkinson, Charles. ''Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations'. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Individual members of terminated tribes were to become full United States citizens with all the rights, benefits and responsibilities of any other United States citizen. The resolution also called for the [[Interior Department]] to quickly identify other tribes who would be ready for termination in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/native_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=96 House Concurrent Resolution 108] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608052514/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/native_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=96 |date=2007-06-08 }}, Digital History, University of Houston&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1953, a Federal task force began meeting with the tribes of the Six Nations. Despite tribal objections, legislation was introduced into Congress for termination.&lt;ref name="srmt-nsn.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srmt-nsn.gov/government/culture_and_history/|title=Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe - Culture and History|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220040158/http://www.srmt-nsn.gov/government/culture_and_history/|archivedate=2014-12-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed legislation involved more than 11,000 Indians of the Iroquois Confederation and was divided into two separate bills. One bill dealt with the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Oneida Indian Nation|Oneida]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]] and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] tribes and the other dealt with the [[Seneca Nation|Seneca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislation terminating federal controls over eight Indian groups submitted to congress|url=http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc012737.pdf|website=bia.gov|publisher=Department of the Interior|accessdate=18 April 2017|date=January 21, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arguments the Six Nations made in their hearings with committees were that their treaties showed that the United States recognized that their lands belonged to the Six Nations, not the United States and that "termination contradicted any reasonable interpretation that their lands would not be claimed or their nations disturbed" by the federal government.&lt;ref name="Johansen (2000)"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zibNDBchPkMC&amp;lpg|title= Encyclopedia of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy) |first=Bruce Elliott and Barbara Alice Mann |last=Johansen |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=2000| isbn = 0-313-30880-2 | page = 42 |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill for the Iroquois Confederation died in committee without further serious consideration.&lt;ref name="srmt-nsn.gov"/&gt;

Though only 127 Seneca families (about 500 people) were being dislocated, the legislation benefited the entire Seneca Nation, because the taking of the Indian land for the dam abridged a 1794 treaty agreement. In addition, the bill provided that within three years, a plan from the Interior Secretary should be submitted to Congress withdrawing all federal supervision over the Seneca Nation, though technically civil and criminal jurisdiction had lain with the State of New York since 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal64-1304836|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20141217174231/http://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal64-1304836|deadurl=yes|title=CQ Almanac Online Edition|date=17 December 2014|archivedate=17 December 2014|website=cqpress.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War===
For the Haudenosaunee, grief for a loved one who died was a powerful emotion that if not attended would cause all sorts of problems for the grieving who if left without consolation would go mad.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 531.&lt;/ref&gt; Rituals to honor the dead were very important and the most important of all was the Condolence ceremony to provide consolation for those who lost a family member or friend.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 531–532.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was believed that the death of a family member also weakened the spiritual strength of the surviving family members, it was considered crucially important to replace the lost family member by providing a substitute who could be adopted or alternatively could be tortured to provide an outlet for the grief.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 pages 530–532.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the "mourning wars".

One of the central features of traditional Iroquois life was the "mourning wars" when Haudenosaunee warriors would raid neighboring peoples in search of captives to replace those Haudenosaunee who had died.&lt;ref name="Richter pages 528"&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 532.&lt;/ref&gt; War for the Haudenosaunee was primarily for captives, and the usual factors that were considered benefits of war for the Europeans like expansion of territory or glory in battle did not count for the Haudeenosaunee, who only cared about taking captives.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 535.&lt;/ref&gt; A successful war party was one that had taken many prisoners without suffering losses in return; killing enemies was considered acceptable if necessary, but disapproved of as it reduced the number of potential captives.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Captives were seen as far more important than scalps. Additionally, war served as a way for young men to demonstrate their valor and courage, which was not only a prerequisite for becoming a chief, but also essential if one wanted to get married and hence have sex.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 530.&lt;/ref&gt; A man considered a coward was viewed as unattractive by Haudenosaunee women who saw bravery in war as a very attractive feature in a man.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; In the precontact era, war was relativity bloodless as First Nations peoples fought one another in suits of wooden armor.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 538.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1609, the French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] observed several battles between the Algonquins and the Iroquois which featured hardly any killing, which seemed to be the norm for First Nations wars.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; At a battle between the Algonquins and the Iroquois by the shores of Lake Champlain, the only people killed were two Iroquois warriors when Champlain demonstrated the power of his musket to his Algonquin allies.

The clan mothers would demand a "mourning war" to provide consolation and renewed spiritual strength for a family that lost a member to death by accusing the warriors of cowardice; either the warriors would go on a "mourning war" or would be marked as cowards forever, which make them unmarriageable.&lt;ref name="Richter pages 528"/&gt; At this point, the warriors would then usually leave to raid a neighboring people in search of captives.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 pages 532–533.&lt;/ref&gt; The captives were either adopted into Haudenosaunee families to become Haudenosaunee, or were to be killed after bouts of ritualized torture as a way of expressing rage at the death of a family member.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 533.&lt;/ref&gt; The male captives were usually received with blows as they were marched into the community, and were then all captives regardless of their sex or age were stripped naked and tied to poles in the middle of the community.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; After having sensitive parts of their bodies burned and some of their fingernails pulled out, the prisoners were allowed to rest and given food and water.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; In the following days, the captives had to dance naked before the community, and then it was decided if they were to be adopted or killed.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; If those who were adopted into the Haudenosaunee families made a sincere effort to become Haudenosaunee, then they would be embraced by the community, and if they did not, then they were swiftly executed.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;

Those slated for execution had to wear red and black facial paint and were "adopted" by a family who addressed the prisoner as "uncle", "aunt", "nephew" or "niece" depending on their age and sex, and would bring them food and water.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 534.&lt;/ref&gt; The captive would be executed after a day-long torture session of burning and removing body parts, which the prisoner was expected to behave with stoicism and nobility (an expectation not usually met) before being scalped alive, had hot sand applied to the exposed skull and finally killed by cutting out their hearts.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; Afterwards, the victim's body was cut and eaten by the community.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; The practice of ritual torture and execution together with cannibalism ended some time in the early 18th century, and by late-18th-century European writers like [[Philip Mazzei]] and [[James Adair (historian)|James Adair]] were denying that the Haudenosaunee engaged in ritual torture and cannibalism, saying they had seen no evidence of such practices during their visits to Haudenosaunee villages.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;

For Iroquois, the purpose of war was to take prisoners first and foremost, with the Onondaga chief Teganissorens telling the governor of New York, Sir [[Robert Hunter (governor)|Robert Hunter]], in 1711: "We are not like you Christians, for when you have prisoners of one another you send them home, by such means you can never rout one another".&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; The converse of this strategy was that the Iroquois would not accept losses in battle as it defeated the whole purpose of the "mourning wars", which was to add to their numbers, not decrease them.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; The French during their wars with the Haudenosaunee were often astonished when a war party that was on the verge of victory over them could be made to retreat by merely killing one or two of their number.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; The European notion of a glorious death in battle had no counterpart with the Haudenosaunee.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Death in battle was accepted only when absolutely necessary, and the Iroquois believed the souls of those who died in battle were destined to spend eternity as angry ghosts haunting the world in search of vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 pages 535-536.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, those who died in battle were never buried in community cemeteries, as it would bring the presence of unhappy ghosts into the community.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 536.&lt;/ref&gt;

For these reasons, the Haudenosaunee engaged in tactics that the French, the British and later on the Americans all considered to be cowardly.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; The Haudenosaunee preferred ambushes and surprise attacks, would almost never attack a fortified place or attack frontally, or would retreat if outnumbered.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; If Kanienkeh was invaded, the Haudenosaunee would attempt to ambush the enemy, or alternatively they would retreat behind the wooden walls of their villages to endure a siege.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; If the enemy appeared too powerful as when the French invaded Kanienkeh in 1693, the Haudenosaunee burned their villages and their crops and the entire population retreated into the woods to wait for the French to depart.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; The main weapons for the Iroquois were bows and arrows with flint tips and quivers made from corn husks.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}} Shields and war clubs were made from wood.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=36}} After contact was established with Europeans, metal knives and hatchets were extensively used together with tomahawks with iron or steel blades.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=36}} Before taking to the field, war chiefs would lead ritual purification ceremonies where the warriors would dance around a pole painted red.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=36}}

When European diseases that the Indians had no immunity to like smallpox devastated the Five Nations in the 17th century, causing thousands of deaths, the League began a period of "mourning wars" without precedent, which led to the virtual destruction of the Huron, Petun and Neutral peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 pages 537-538.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1640s, it is estimated that smallpox had reduced the population of the Haudenosaunee by least 50%, which required massive "mourning wars" to make up these losses.&lt;ref name="auto11"&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 537.&lt;/ref&gt; The American historian Daniel Richter wrote it was at this point that war changed from being sporadic, small-scale raids launched in response to individual deaths and became "the constant and increasing undifferentiated symptom of societies in demographic crisis".&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; Furthermore, the introduction of guns, which could pierce the wooden armor, made First Nations warfare bloodier and more deadly than it had been in the pre-contact era, ending the age when armed conflicts were more brawls than battles as Europeans would had understood the term.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; At the same time, guns could be only be obtained by trading furs with the Europeans, and once the Haudenosaunee exhausted their supplies of beaver by about 1640, they were forced to buy beaver pelts from Indians living further north, which led them to attempt to eliminate other middlemen in order to monopolize the fur trade in a series of "beaver wars".&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 539.&lt;/ref&gt; Richter wrote "the mourning war tradition, deaths from disease, dependence on firearms, and the trade in furs combined to produce a dangerous spiral: epidemics led to deadlier mourning wars fought with firearms; the need for guns increased the need for pelts to trade for them; the quest for furs provoked wars with other nations; and deaths in those wars began the mourning war cycle anew".&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt; From 1640 to 1701, the Five Nations was almost continuously at war, battling at various times the French, the Huron, the Erie, the Neutral, the Lenape, the Susquenhannock, the Petun, the Abenaki, the Ojibwa, and the Algonquins, fighting campaigns from Virginia to the Mississippi and all the way to what is now northern Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 541.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite taking thousands of captives, the Five Nations populations continued to fall, as diseases continued to take their toll while Jesuits, whom the Haudenosaunee were forced to accept after making peace with the French in 1667, encouraged Catholic converts to move to the St. Lawrence river valley.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 pages 542–543.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1640s, the Mohawks could field about 800 warriors, and the 1670s, could field only 300 warriors, which suggested a population decline.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Daniel "War and Culture: The Iroquois Experience" pages 528–559 from ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Volume 40, No. 4, October 1983 page 542.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melting pot===
The Iroquois League traditions allowed for the dead to be symbolically replaced through captives taken in "mourning wars", the blood feuds and vendettas that were an essential aspect of Iroquois culture.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Daniel K. The Ordeal of the Longhouse: The Peoples of the Iroquois League in the Era of European Colonization. Chapel-Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1992. 32&lt;/ref&gt; As a way of expediting the mourning process, raids were conducted to take vengeance and seize captives. Captives were generally adopted directly by the grieving family to replace the member(s) who had been lost.

This process not only allowed the Iroquois to maintain their own numbers, but also to disperse and assimilate their enemies. The adoption of conquered peoples, especially during the period of the [[Beaver Wars]] (1609-1701), meant that the Iroquois League was composed largely of naturalized members of other tribes. [[Cadwallader Colden]] wrote, "It has been a constant maxim with the Five Nations, to save children and young men of the people they conquer, to adopt them into their own Nation, and to educate them as their own children, without distinction; These young people soon forget their own country and nation and by this policy the Five Nations make up the losses which their nation suffers by the people they lose in war."  Those who attempted to return to their families were harshly punished; for instance, the French fur trader [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] was captured by an Iroquois raiding party as a teenager, was adopted by a Mohawk family, ran away to return to his family in [[Trois-Rivières]], and upon being recaptured was punished by having his fingernails pulled out and having one of his fingers cut to the bone.&lt;ref name="Fournier, Martin pages 33-34"&gt;Fournier, Martin ''Pierre-Esprit Radisson: Merchant Adventurer, 1636-1701'', Montreal: McGill University Press, 2002 pages 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Radisson was not executed as his adopted parents provided gifts to the families of the men Radisson had killed when he fled as compensation for their loss; several of the Huron who fled with Radisson were not so lucky and were executed.&lt;ref name="Fournier, Martin pages 33-34"/&gt;

By 1668, two-thirds of the Oneida village were assimilated Algonquians and Hurons. At Onondaga there were Native Americans of seven different nations and among the Seneca eleven.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; They also adopted European captives, as did the Catholic Mohawk in settlements outside Montreal. This tradition of adoption and assimilation was common to native people of the northeast but was quite different from European settlers' notions of combat.

===Settlement===
[[File:Theiroquoislonghouse.png|thumb|Traditional Iroquois [[longhouse]]]]
At the time of first European contact the Iroquois lived in a small number of large villages scattered throughout their territory. Each nation had between one and four villages at any one time, and villages were moved approximately every five to twenty years as soil and firewood were depleted.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Eric E.|title=Iroquois Population History and Settlement Ecology, AD 1500-1700|date=December 2008|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University|url=https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/8916|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These settlements were surrounded by a [[palisade]] and usually located in a defensible area such as a hill, with access to water.&lt;ref name=MohawkCountry /&gt; Because of their appearance with the palisade, Europeans termed them castles. Villages were usually built on level or raised ground, surrounded by log palisades and sometimes ditches.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=33}}

Within the villages the inhabitants lived in [[longhouse]]s. Longhouses varied in size from 15 to 150 feet long and 15 to 25 feet in breadth.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=33}} Longhouses were usually built of layers of elm bark on a frame of rafters and standing logs raised upright.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=33}} In 1653, Dutch official and landowner [[Adriaen van der Donck]] described a Mohawk longhouse in his ''Description of New Netherland''. 

{{quote|Their houses are mostly of one and the same shape, without any special embellishment or remarkable design. When building a house, large or small,—for sometimes they build them as long as some hundred feet, though never more than twenty feet wide—they stick long, thin, peeled hickory poles in the ground, as wide apart and as long as the house is to be. The poles are then bent over and fastened one to another, so that it looks like a wagon or arbor as are put in gardens. Next, strips like split laths are laid across these poles from one end to the other. ... This is then well covered all over with very tough bark. ... From one end of the house to the other along the center they kindle fires, and the area left open, which is also in the middle, serves as a chimney to release the smoke. Often there are sixteen or eighteen families in a house ... This means that often a hundred or a hundred and fifty or more lodge in one house.}} 

Usually, between 2 and 20 families lived in a single longhouse with sleeping platforms being 2 feet above the ground and food left to dry on the rafters.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=33}} A castle might contain twenty or thirty longhouses. In addition to the castles the Iroquois also had smaller settlements which might be occupied seasonally by smaller groups, for example for fishing or hunting.&lt;ref name="MohawkCountry" /&gt; Living in the smoke-filled longhouses often caused conjunctivitis.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}}

Total population for the five nations has been estimated at 20,000 before 1634. After 1635 the population dropped to around 6,800, chiefly due to the epidemic of [[smallpox]] introduced by contact with European settlers.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; The Iroquois lived in extended families divided clans headed by clan mothers that grouped into ''moieities'' ("halves"). The typical clan consisted of about 50 to 200 people.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=21}} The division of the Iroquois went as follows:
'''Cayuga''' 
''Moiety'' (A) clans: Bear, Beaver, Heron, Turtle, Wolf
''Moiety'' (B) clans: Turtle, Bear, Deer
'''Tuscarora'''
''Moiety'' (A) clans: Bear, Wolf
''Moeity'' (B) clans: Eel, Snipe, Beaver, Turtle, Deer
'''Seneca'''

''Moeity'' (B) clan: Bear, Hawk, Eel, Deer
'''Oneida'''
''Moeity'' (A) clan: wolf
''Moeity'' (B) clans: Bear, Turtle
'''Mohawk'''
''Moeity'' (A) clans: Wolf, Bear
''Moeity'' (B) clan: Turtle.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=21}} Government was by the 50 ''sachems'' representing the various clans who were chosen by the clan mothers.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=21}} Assisting the ''sachems'' were the "Pinetree Chiefs" who served as diplomats and the "War Chiefs" who led the war parties; neither the "Pinetree Chiefs" or the "War Chiefs" were allowed to vote at council meetings.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=22}}

By the late 1700s The Iroquois were building smaller log cabins resembling those of the colonists, but retaining some native features, such as bark roofs with smoke holes and a central fireplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kerber|first1=Jordan E.

The Iroquois are a mix of [[horticulture|horticulturalists]], farmers, fishers, gatherers and hunters, though their main diet traditionally has come from farming. The main crops they cultivated are corn, beans and squash, which were called the [[Three sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]] (''De-oh-há-ko'') and are considered special gifts from the Creator.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}} These crops are grown strategically. The cornstalks grow, the bean plants climb the stalks, and the squash grow beneath, inhibiting weeds and keeping the soil moist under the shade of their broad leaves. In this combination, the soil remained fertile for several decades. The food was stored during the winter, and it lasted for two to three years. When the soil in one area eventually lost its fertility, the Haudenosaunee moved their village. For the Iroquois, farming was traditionally women's work and the entire process of planting, maintaining, harvesting and cooking the "Three Sisters" were done by women.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}} At harvest time, Iroquois women would use corn husks to make hats, dolls, rope and moccasins.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}} Besides for the "Three Sisters", the Iroquois also eat artichokes, leeks, cucumbers, turnips, pumpkins, a number of different berries such blackberries, blueberries, gooseberries, etc. and wild nuts.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}} The "Three Sisters" were ground up into hominy and soups in clay pots, which were disregarded for metal pots after the contact was made with Europeans.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}}

Gathering is the traditional job of the women and children. Wild roots, greens, berries and nuts were gathered in the summer. During spring, sap is tapped from the [[maple]] trees and boiled into [[maple syrup]], and herbs are gathered for medicine. After the coming of Europeans, the Iroquois started to grow apples, pears, cherries, and peaches.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}}

The Iroquois hunted mostly deer but also other game such as wild turkey and migratory birds. Muskrat and beaver were hunted during the winter. Archaeologists have the bones of bison, elk, deer, bear, raccoon, and porcupines at Iroquois villages.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}}  Fishing was also a significant source of food because the Iroquois had villages mostly in the St.Lawrence and Great Lakes areas. The Iroquois used nets made from vegetable fiber with weights of pebbles for fishing.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}} They fished salmon, trout, bass, perch and whitefish until the St. Lawrence became too polluted by industry. In the spring the Iroquois netted, and in the winter fishing holes were made in the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Bial |first = Raymond |title = Lifeways: The Iroquois |publisher = Benchmark Books |year = 1999 |location = New York |isbn = 0-7614-0802-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allium tricoccum]] is also a part of traditional Iroquois cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, F. W. 1916 Iroquois Foods and Food Preparation. Ottawa. Canada Department of Mines (p. 118)&lt;/ref&gt; Starting about 1620, the Iroquois started to raise pigs, geese and chickens, which they had acquired from the Dutch.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}}

===Dress===
[[File:Seneca_man_in_traditional_costume.png|thumb|upright|Seneca man in traditional dress]]
In 1644 [[Johannes Megapolensis]] described Mohawk traditional wear. 

{{quote|In summer they go naked, having only their private parts covered with a patch. The children and young folks to ten, twelve and fourteen years of age go stark naked. In winter, they hang about them simply an undressed deer or bear or panther skin; or they take some beaver and otter skins, wild cat, racoon, martin, otter, mink, squirrel or such like skins ... and sew some of them to others, until it is a square piece, and that is then a garment for them; or they buy of us Dutchmen two and a half ells [about {{convert|170|cm|ft}}] of [[wiktionary:duffel|duffel]], and that they hang simply about them, just as it was torn off, without sewing it.&lt;ref name=MohawkCountry /&gt;}}

On their feet the Iroquois wore [[moccasin]]s, "true to nature in its adjustment to the foot, beautiful in its materials and finish, and durable as an article of apparel."&lt;ref name=MorganLH /&gt; 

{{quote|The moccason is made of one piece of deer-skin. It is seamed up at the heel, and also in front, above the foot, leaving the bottom of the moccasin without a seam. In front the deer-skin is gathered, in place of being crimped; over this part porcupine quills or beads are worked, in various patterns. The plain moccasin rises several inches above the ankle ... and is fastened with deer strings; but usually this part is turned down, so as to expose a part of the instep, and is ornamented with bead-work.&lt;ref name=MorganLH /&gt;}}

Moccasins of a sort were also made of corn husks.

In 1653 Dutch official [[Adriaen van der Donck]] wrote: 

{{quote|Around their waist they all [i.e.both men and women] wear a belt made of leather, whalefin, whalebone, or wampum. The men pull a length of duffel cloth—if they have it—under this belt, front and rear, and pass it between the legs. It is over half an ell [{{convert|35|cm|in}}] wide and nine quarter-ells [{{convert|155|cm|in}}] long, which leaves a square flap hanging down in front and back ... Before duffel cloth was common in that country, and sometimes even now when it cannot be had, they took for that purpose some dressed leather or fur—The women also wear a length of woolen cloth of full width [{{convert|165|cm|in}}] and an ell and a quarter [{{convert|90|cm|in}}] long, which comes halfway down the leg. It is like a petticoat, but under it, next to the body, they wear a deerskin which also goes around the waist and ends in cleverly cut pointed edging and fringes. The wealthier women and those who have a liking for it wear such skirts wholly embroidered with wampum ... As for covering the upper part of the body both men and women use a sheet of duffel cloth of full width, i.e. nine and a half quarter-ells, and about three ells {{convert|210|cm|in}} long. It is usually worn over the right shoulder and tied in a knot around the waist and from there hangs down to the feet.&lt;ref name=MohawkCountry /&gt;}}

During the 17th century, Iroquois clothing changed rapidly as a result of the introduction of scissors and needles obtained from the Europeans, and the British scholar Michael Johnson has cautioned that European accounts of Iroquois clothing from the latter 17th century may not have entirely reflected traditional pre-contact Iroquois clothing.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=36}} In the 17th century women normally went topless in the warm months while wearing a buckskin skirt overlapping on the left while in the winter women covered their upper bodies with a cape-like upper garment with an opening for the head.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=36-37}} By the 18th century, cloth colored red and blue obtained from Europeans became the standard material for clothing with the men and women wearing blouses and shirts that usually decorated with beadwork and ribbons and were often worn alongside sliver broaches.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}}

By the latter 18th century, women were wearing muslin or calico long, loose-fitting overdresses.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} The tendency of Iroquois women to abandon their traditional topless style of dressing in the warm months reflected European influence.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} Married women wore their hair in a single braid held in place by a comb made of bone, antler or silver while unmarried wore their hair in several braids.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} Warriors wore moccasins, leggings and short kilts and on occasion wore robes that were highly decorated with painted designs.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} Initially, men's clothing was made of buckskin and were decorated with porcupine quill-work and later on was made of broadcloth obtained from Europeans.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} The bodies and faces of Iroquois men were heavily tattooed with geometric designs and their noses and ears were pieced with rings made up of wampun or silver.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} On the warpath, the faces and bodies of the warriors were painted half red, half black.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} The men usually shaved most of their hair with leaving only a tuft of hair in the center, giving the name Mohawk to their hair style.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} A cap made of either buckskin or cloth tied to wood splints called the ''Gus-to-weh'' that was decorated with feathers was often worn by men.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} Buckskin ammunition pouches with straps over the shoulder together with belts or slashes that carried powder horn and tomahawks were usually worn by warriors.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} Quilled knife cases were worn around the neck.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=38}}  Chiefs wore headdresses made of deer antler.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} By the 18th century, Iroquois men normally wore shirts and leggings made of broadcloth and buckskin coats.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}} In the 17th and 18th centuries silver armbands and gorgets were popular accessories.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=37}}

By the 1900s most Iroquois were wearing the same clothing as their non-Iroquois neighbors. Today most nations only wear their traditional clothing to ceremonies or special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional Appearance|url=http://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/appearance.html|website=Haudenosaunee Confederacy|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iroquois_gustoweh_headdress.png|thumb|left|gusto'weh headdress]]
Men wore a cap with a single long feather rotating in a socket called a ''gustoweh''. Later, feathers in the gustoweh denote the wearer's tribe by their number and positioning. The Mohawk wear three upright feathers, the Oneida two upright and one down. The Onondaga wear one feather pointing upward and another pointing down. The Cayuga have a single feather at a forty-five degree angle. The Seneca wear a single feather pointing up, and the Tuscarora have no distinguishing feathers.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

[[File:Seneca_woman_in_traditional_costume.png|thumb|upright|Seneca woman in traditional dress]]
Writing in 1851 Morgan wrote that women's outfits consisted of a skirt (gä-kä'-ah) "usually of blue broadcloth, and elaborately embroidered with bead-work. It requires two yards of cloth, which is worn with the selvedge at the top and bottom; the skirt being secured about the waist and descending nearly to the top of the moccasin." Under the skirt, between the knees and the moccasins,  women wore leggings (gise'-hǎ), called ''[[pantalettes]]'' by Morgan, "of red broadcloth, and ornamented with a border of beadwork around the lower edge ... In ancient times the gise'-hǎ was made of deer-skin and embroidered with porcupine-quill work." An over-dress (ah-de-a'-da-we-sa) of [[muslin]] or [[calico]] was worn over the skirt, it is "gathered slightly at the waist, and falls part way down the skirt ... In front it is generally buttoned with silver broaches." The blanket (e'yose) is two or three yards of blue or green broadcloth "it falls from the head or neck in natural folds the width of the cloth, as the [[selvedge]]s are at the top and bottom, and it is gathered round the person like a shawl."&lt;ref name=MorganLH /&gt;

The women wore their hair very long and tied together at the back, or "tied at the back of the head and folded into a tress of about a hand's length, like a beaver tail ... they wear around the forehead a strap of wampum shaped like the headband that some was worn in olden times." "The men have a long lock hanging down, some on one side of the head, and some on both sides. On the top of their heads they have a streak of hair from the forehead to the neck, about the breadth of three fingers, and this they shorten until it is about two or three fingers long, and it stands right on end like a cock's comb or hog's bristles; on both sides of this cock's comb they cut all the hair short, except for the aforesaid locks, and they also leave on the bare places here and there small locks, such as aree in sweeping brushes and then they are in fine array."&lt;ref name=MohawkCountry /&gt; This is the forerunner to what is today called a "[[Mohawk hairstyle]]."

The women did not paint their faces. The men "paint their faces red, blue, etc."&lt;ref name=MohawkCountry /&gt;

===Women in society===
{{further|Clan Mother|Matriarchy}}
The Iroquois have historically followed a matriarchal system. No person is entitled to 'own' land, but it is believed that the Creator appointed women as stewards of the land. Traditionally, the Clan Mothers appoint leaders, as they have raised children and are therefore held to a higher regard. By the same token, if a leader does not prove sound, becomes corrupt or does not listen to the people, the Clan Mothers have the power to strip him of his leadership.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Katsithawi|title=Gender Roles among the Iroquois|url=https://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/tlc/publications/native-circle/native-circle-2003/ashley-thomas3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iroquois have traditionally followed a [[matrilineality|matrilineal system]], with women holding property and hereditary leadership passing through their lines. Historically women have held the dwellings, horses and farmed land, and a woman's property before marriage has stayed in her possession without being mixed with that of her husband. Men and women have traditionally had separate roles but both hold real power in the Nations. The work of a woman's hands is hers to do with as she sees fit. Historically, at marriage, a young couple lived in the longhouse of the wife's family. A woman choosing to divorce a shiftless or otherwise unsatisfactory husband is able to ask him to leave the dwelling and take his possessions with him.&lt;ref&gt;Benokraitis, Nijole V. (2011) Marriages &amp; Families, 7th Edition. Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey, p. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The children of a traditional marriage belong to their mother's [[clan]] and gain their social status through hers. Her brothers are important teachers and mentors to the children, especially introducing boys to men's roles and societies. The clans are matrilineal, that is, clan ties are traced through the mother's line. If a couple separates, the woman traditionally keeps the children.&lt;ref name=Wagner1999&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.now.org/nnt/summer-99/iroquois.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816164431/http://www.now.org/nnt/summer-99/iroquois.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2000-08-16 |title=Iroquois Women Inspire 19th Century Feminists |accessdate=2009-03-21 |last=Wagner |first=Sally Roesch |year=1999 |work=National NOW Times |publisher=[[National Organization for Women]] |location= |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief of a clan can be removed at any time by a council of the women elders of that clan. The chief's sister has historically been responsible for nominating his successor.&lt;ref name=Wagner1999/&gt; The [[clan mother]]s, the elder women of each clan, are highly respected. It is regarded as incest by the Iroquois to marry within one's matrilineal clan, but considered acceptable to marry someone from the same patrilineal clan.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, Thomas "On Iroquois Incest" pages 29-43 from ''Anthropologica'', Volume 10, Issue 1, 1968 pages 30-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual beliefs===
[[File:PSM V41 D760 An iroquois dancer in costume.jpg|thumb|upright|Member of the [[False Face Society]]]]
Like many cultures, the Iroquois' spiritual beliefs changed over time and varied across tribes. Generally, the Iroquois believed in numerous deities, including the [[Great Spirit]], the Thunderer, and the Three Sisters (the spirits of beans, maize, and squash). The Great Spirit was thought to have created plants, animals, and humans to control "the forces of good in nature", and to guide ordinary people.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=167}} [[Orenda]] was the Iroquoian name for the magical potence found in people and their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hewitt|first1=J. N. B.|title=Orenda and a Definition of Religion|journal=American Anthropologist|date=1902|volume=4|issue=1|pages=33–46|jstor=658926|doi=10.1525/aa.1902.4.1.02a00050}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iroquois believed in the ''orenda'', the spiritual force that flowed all things, and believed if people were respectful of nature, then the ''orenda'' would harnessed to bring about positive results.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=23}} There were three types of spirits for the Iroquois: 1) Those living on the earth 2) Those living above the earth and 3) the highest level of spirits controlling the universe from high above with the most highest being known variously as the Great Spirit, the Great Creator or the Master of Life.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=23}}

Sources provide different stories about Iroquois creation beliefs. Brascoupé and Etmanskie focus on the first person to walk the earth, called the Skywoman or Aientsik. Aientsik's daughter Tekawerahkwa gave birth to twins, Tawiskaron, who created vicious animals and river rapids, while Okwiraseh created "all that is pure and beautiful".{{sfn|Brascoupé|Etmanskie|2006|p=1328}}  After a battle where Okwiraseh defeated Tawiskaron, Tawiskaron was confined to "the dark areas of the world", where he governed the night and destructive creatures.{{sfn|Brascoupé|Etmanskie|2006|p=1328}} Other scholars present the "twins" as the Creator and his brother, Flint.{{sfn|Saraydar|1990|p=21}} The Creator was responsible for game animals, while Flint created predators and disease. Saraydar (1990) suggests the Iroquois do not see the twins as polar opposites but understood their relationship to be more complex, noting "Perfection is not to be found in gods or humans or the worlds they inhabit."{{sfn|Saraydar|1990|p=22}}

Descriptions of Iroquois spiritual history consistently refer to dark times of terror and misery prior to the Iroquois Confederacy, ended by the arrival of the [[Great Peacemaker]]. Tradition asserts that the Peacemaker demonstrated his authority as the Creator's messenger by climbing a tall tree above a waterfall, having the people cut down the tree, and reappearing the next morning unharmed.{{sfn|Saraydar|1990|p=22}} The Peacemaker restored mental health to a few of the most "violent and dangerous men", Ayonhwatha and Thadodaho, who then helped him bear the message of peace to others. {{sfn|Saraydar|1990|p=23}}

After the arrival of the Europeans, some Iroquois became [[Christianity|Christians]], among them the first Native American Saint, [[Kateri Tekakwitha]], a young woman of Mohawk-Algonquin parents. The Seneca sachem [[Handsome Lake]], also known as Ganeodiyo,{{sfn|Brascoupé|Etmanskie|2006|p=1329}} introduced a new religious system to the Iroquois in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Wallace |first = Anthony |title = Death and Rebirth of the Seneca |publisher = Vintage |date = April 12, 1972 |location = |pages =  |url =  |doi =  |id =  |isbn = 978-0-394-71699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporated Quaker beliefs along with traditional Iroquoian culture.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=167}} Handsome Lake's teachings include a focus on parenting, appreciation of life, and peace.{{sfn|Brascoupé|Etmanskie|2006|p=1329}}  A key aspect of Handsome Lake's teachings is the principle of equilibrium, wherein each person's talents combined into a functional community. By the 1960s, at least 50% of Iroquois followed this religion.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=167}}

Dreams play a significant role in Iroquois spirituality, providing information about a person's desires and prompting individuals to fulfill dreams. To communicate upward, humans can send prayers to spirits by burning tobacco.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=167}}

Iroquois ceremonies are primarily concerned with farming, healing, and thanksgiving. Key festivals correspond to the agricultural calendar, and include Maple, Planting, Strawberry, Green Maize, Harvest, and Mid-Winter (or New Year's), which is held in early February.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=167}} The ceremonies were given by the Creator to the Iroquois to balance good with evil.{{sfn|Saraydar|1990|p=22}} In the 17th century, Europeans described the Iroquois as having 17 festivals, but only 8 are observed today.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=23}} The most important of the ceremonies were the New Year Festival, the Maple Festival held in late March to celebrate spring, the Sun Shooting Festival which also celebrates spring, the Seed Dance in May to celebrate the planting of the crops, the Strawberry Festival in June to celebrate the ripening of the strawberries, the Thunder Ceremony to bring rain in July, the Green Bean Festival in early August, the Green Corn Festival in late August and the Harvest Festival in October.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=23}} Of all the festivals, the most important were the Green Corn Festival to celebrate the maturing of the corn and the New Year Festival.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=23}} During all of the festivals, men and women from the False Face Society, the Medicine Society and the Husk Face Society would dance wearing their masks in attempt to humor the spirits that controlled nature.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=23}} The most important of the occasions for the masked dancers to appear were the New Year Festival, which was felt to be an auspicious occasion to chase the malevolent spirits that were believed to cause disease.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=23}}

During healing ceremonies, a carved "False Face Mask" is worn to represent spirits in a tobacco-burning and prayer ritual. False Face Masks are carved in living trees, then cut free to be painted and decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, 1996, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; False Faces represent grandfathers of the Iroquois, and are thought to reconnect humans and nature and to frighten illness-causing spirits.{{sfn|Brascoupé|Etmanskie|2006|p=1329}} The [[False Face Society]] continues today among modern Iroquois. The Iroquois have three different medical societies. The False Face Company conducts rituals to cure sick people by driving away spirits; the Husk Face Society is made up of those had dreams seen as messages from the spirits and the Secret Medicine Society likewise conducts rituals to cure the sick.{{sfn|Johhson|2003|p=34}} There are 12 different types of masks worn by the societies.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=34}} The types of masks are
A) ''The Secret Society of Medicine Men and the Company of Mystic Animals''
1) Divided mask that painted half black and half red.
2) Masks with exaggerated long noses.
3) Horn masks
4) Blind masks without eye sockets.
B) ''Husk Face Society''
5) Masks made of braided corn
C) ''False Face Society''
6) Whistling masks
7) Masks with smiling faces.
8) Masks with protruding tongues.
9) Masks with exaggerated hanging mouths.
10) Masks with exaggerated straight lops.
11) Masks with spoon-lips.
12) Masks with a disfigured twisted mouth.
The "crooked face" masks with the twisted mouths, the masks with the spoon lips and the whistling masks are the Doctor masks.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=34}} The other masks are "Common Face" or "Beggar" masks that are worn by those who help the Doctors.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}} The Husk Face Society performs rituals to communicate with the spirits in nature to ensure a good crop, the False Face Society performs rituals to chase away evil spirits and the Secret Medicine Society performs rituals to cure diseases.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=24}} The grotesque masks represent the faces of the spirits that the dancers are attempting to please.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=34}} Those wearing Doctor masks blow hot ashes into the faces of the sick to chase away the evil spirits that are believed to be causing the illness.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=34}} The masked dancers often carried turtle shell rattles and long staffs.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=35}}

Condolence ceremonies are conducted by the Iroquois for both ordinary and important people, but most notably when sachems died. Such ceremonies were still held on Iroquois reservations as late as the 1970s.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=167}} After death, the soul is thought to embark on a journey, undergo a series of ordeals, and arrive in the sky world. This journey is thought to take one year, during which the Iroquois mourn for the dead. After the mourning period, a feast is held to celebrate the soul's arrival in the skyworld.

"Keepers of the faith" are part-time specialists who conduct religious ceremonies. Both men and women can be appointed as keepers of the faith by tribe elders.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=167}}

The Iroquois traditionally celebrate six major festivals throughout the year.&lt;ref name=MorganLH /&gt; These usually combine a spiritual component and ceremony, a feast, a chance to celebrate together, sports, entertainment and dancing. These celebrations have historically been oriented to the seasons and celebrated based on the cycle of nature rather than fixed calendar dates.

For instance, the Mid-winter festival, ''Gi'-ye-wä-no-us-quä-go-wä'' ("The supreme belief") ushers in the new year. This festival is traditionally held for one week around the end of January to early February, depending on when the new moon occurs that year.&lt;ref name=MorganLH /&gt;{{rp|pp.200–201}}

===Art===
Iroquois art from the 16th and 17th centuries as found on bowls, pottery and clay pipes show a mixture of animal, geometrical and human imagery.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=38}} Moose hair was sometimes attached to tumplines or burden straps for decorative effect.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=38}} Porcupine quillwork was sewn onto bags, clothing and moccasins, usually in geometrical designs.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=38}} Other designs included the "great turtle" upon North America was said to rest; the circular "skydome" and wavy designs.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=38}} Beads and clothes often featured semi-circles and waves which meant to represent the "skydome" which consisted of the entire universe together with the supernatural world above it, parallel lines for the earth and curved lines for the "celestial tree".{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=38}} Floral designs were first introduced in the 17th century, reflecting French influence, but did not become truly popular until the 19th century.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=38}} Starting about 1850 the Iroquois art began to frequently feature floral designs on moccasins, caps, pouches and pincushions, which were purchased by Euro-Americans.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=39}} The British historian Michael Johnson described the Iroquois artwork meant to be sold to whites in the 19th century as having a strong feel of "Victoriana" to them.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=39}} Silver was much valued by the Iroquois from the 17th century onward, and starting in the 18th century, the Iroquois became "excellent silversmiths", making silver earrings, gorgets and rings.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=39}}

===Games and sports===
The favorite sport of the Iroquois was ''[[lacrosse]]'' (O-tä-dä-jish′-quä-äge in Seneca).&lt;ref name=MorganLH /&gt; This version was played between two teams of six or eight players, made up of members of two sets of clans (Wolf, Bear, Beaver, and Turtle on one side vs. Deer, Snipe, Heron, and Hawk on the other among the Senecas). The goals were two sets of poles roughly {{convert|450|yd|m}} apart.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Morgan: "eighty rods"&lt;/ref&gt; The poles were about {{convert|10|ft|m}} high and placed about {{convert|15|ft|m}} apart.&lt;ref group=note&gt;"three rods"&lt;/ref&gt; A goal was scored by carrying or throwing a deer-skin ball between the goal posts using netted sticks—touching the ball with hands was prohibited. The game was played to a score of five or seven. The modern version of lacrosse remains popular as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Demirel|first1=Evin|title=A MILLENNIUM AFTER INVENTING THE GAME, THE IROQUOIS ARE LACROSSE'S NEW SUPERPOWER|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/21/a-millennium-after-inventing-the-game-the-iroquois-are-lacrosse-s-new-superpower.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular winter game was the ''[[Snow snake|snow-snake game]]''.&lt;ref name=MorganLH /&gt; The "snake" was a [[Carya ovata|hickory]] pole about {{convert|5–7|ft|m}} long and about {{convert|.25|in|cm}} in diameter, turned up slightly at the front and weighted with lead. The game was played between two sides of up to six players each, often boys, but occasionally between the men of two clans. The snake, or Gawa′sa, was held by placing the index finger against the back end and balancing it on the thumb and other fingers. It was not thrown but slid across the surface of the snow. The side whose snake went the farthest scored one point. Other snakes from the same side which went farther than any other snake of the opposing side also scored a point; the other side scored nothing. This was repeated until one side scored the number of points which had been agreed to for the game, usually seven or ten.

The ''Peach-stone game'' (Guskä′eh) was a gambling game in which the clans bet against each other.&lt;ref name=MorganLH /&gt;  Traditionally it was played on the final day of the Green Corn, Harvest, and Mid-winter festivals. The game was played using a wooden bowl about one foot in diameter and six peach-stones (pits) ground to oval shape and burned black on one side. A "bank" of beans, usually 100, was used to keep score and the winner was the side who won them all. Two players sat on a blanket-covered platform raised a few feet off the floor. To play the peach stones were put into the bowl and shaken. Winning combinations were five of either color or six of either color showing.

Players started with five beans each from the bank. The starting player shook the bowl; if he shook a five the other player paid him one bean, if a six five beans. If he shook either he got to shake again. If he shook anything else the turn passed to his opponent. All his winnings were handed over to a "manager" or "managers" for his side. If a player lost all of his beans another player from his side took his place and took five beans from the bank. Once all beans had been taken from the bank the game continued, but with the draw of beans now coming from the winnings of the player's side, which were kept out of sight so that no one but the managers knew how the game was going. The game was finished when one side had won all the beans.

The game sometimes took quite a while to play, depending on the starting number of beans, and games lasting more than a day were common.

The [[First Nations Lacrosse Association]] is recognized by the [[Federation of International Lacrosse]] as a sovereign state for international lacrosse competitions. It is the only sport in which the Iroquois field national teams and the only [[indigenous people]]'s organization sanctioned for international competition by any world sporting governing body.

===Naming conventions===
Each clan has a group of personal names which may be used to name members. The clan mother is responsible for keeping track of those names not in use, which may then be reused to name infants. When a child becomes an adult he takes a new "adult" name in place of his "baby" name. Some names are reserved for chiefs or faith keepers, and when a person assumes that office he takes the name in a ceremony in which he is considered to "resuscitate" the previous holder. If a chief resigns or is removed he gives up the name and resumes his previous one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Tooker| first1=Elisabeth| title=The Iroquois Ceremonial of Midwinter| date=1970| publisher=Syracuse University Press| isbn=978-0815621492| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8RNWdnJigQC&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=iroquois%20naming&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q=iroquois%20naming&amp;f=false| accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cannibalism===
Although the Iroquois are sometimes mentioned as examples of groups who practiced [[cannibalism]], the evidence is mixed as to whether such a practice could be said to be widespread among the Six Nations, and to whether it was a notable cultural feature. Some anthropologists have found evidence of ritual [[torture]] and cannibalism at Iroquois sites, for example, among the [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] in the sixteenth century.{{sfn|Bradley|1987|p=37}}{{sfn|Bradley|1987|p=54}} However, other scholars, most notably anthropologist William Arens in his controversial book, ''[[The Man-Eating Myth]]'', have challenged the evidence, suggesting the human bones found at sites point to [[Funeral|funerary practices]], asserting that if cannibalism was practiced among the Iroquois, it was not widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Arens| first1=William| title=The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and Anthropophagy| date=1980| publisher=Oxford| isbn=978-0195027938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern anthropologists seem to accept the probability that cannibalism did exist among the Iroquois,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Abler| first1=Thomas| title=Iroquois Cannibalism: Fact not Fiction| journal=Ethnohistory| date=1980| volume=27|issue=4| pages=309–316| jstor=481728| doi=10.2307/481728}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Thomas Abler describing the evidence from the Jesuit Relations and archaeology as making a "case for cannibalism in early historic times ... so strong that it cannot be doubted."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = | title = Iroquois Cannibalism: Fact not Fiction| last = Abler| first = Thomas S.| date = 1980| journal = Ethnohistory, 27, no. 4, Special Iroquois Issue, 309-315| doi = | pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars are also urged to remember the context for a practice that now shocks the modern Western society. Sanday reminds us that the ferocity of the Iroquois' rituals "cannot be separated from the severity of conditions ... where death from hunger, disease, and warfare became a way of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Sanday| first1=Peggy Reeves| title=Divine Hunger: Cannibalism as a Cultural System| date=1986| publisher=Cambridge| isbn=978-0521311144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missionaries Johannes Megapolensis, [[François-Joseph Bressani]], and the fur trader [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] present first-hand accounts of cannibalism among the Mohawk.  A common theme is ritualistic roasting and eating the heart of a captive who has been tortured and killed.&lt;ref name=MohawkCountry&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snow|first1=Dean R.|last2=Gehring|first2=Charles T.|last3=Starna|first3=William A.|title=In Mohawk Country|date=1996|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=0-8156-2723-8|pages=xix–xx|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1tbXzVpHtMsC|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "To eat your enemy is to perform an extreme form of physical dominance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://www.historytoday.com/richard-sugg/eating-your-enemy  | title = Eating Your Enemy| last = Sugg| first = Richard| date = July 2008| journal = History Today |volume=58 |issue=7| doi = | pmid = | access-date = May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''Slavery''' ===
As mentioned above in section 5.1 War, Haudenosaunee peoples participated in “mourning wars” to obtain captives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois#War|title=Iroquois|website=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leland Donald suggests in “Slavery in Indigenous North America” that captives and slaves were interchangeable roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge World History of Slavery|last=Donald|first=Leland|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-511-97540-0|editor-last=Eltis|editor-first=David|volume=3|location=Cambridge|pages=218-219|chapter=Slavery in Indigenous North America|editor-last2=Engerman|editor-first2=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been archaeological studies to support that Haudenosaunee peoples did in fact have a hierarchal system that included slaves.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=234}} Note that the term slave in Haudenosaunee culture is identified by spiritual and revengeful purposes, not to be mistaken for the term slave in the [[Slavery in the United States|African Slave Trade.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Starna|first=William|last2=Watkins|first2=Ralph|date=Winter 1991|title=Northern Iroquoian Slavery|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/482790|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=38|issue=1|pages=35-36|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capture'''

To obtain slaves, Haudenosaunee peoples battled in “mourning wars”.{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=37}}{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=218}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parmenter|first=Jon|date=2007|title=After the Mourning Wars: The Iroquois as Allies in Colonial North American Campaigns, 1676-1760|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4491596|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=64|issue=1|page=39|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the wars were over, Haudenosaunee warriors journeyed back to their villages with the new slaves they had captured. During these journeys, slaves were routinely tortured or even killed by their captors.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=218}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ordeal of the Longhouse: The Peoples of the Iroquois League in the Era of European Colonization|last=Richter|first=Daniel|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1992|isbn=0-8078-2060-1|location=Chapel Hill|pages=66|chapter=The Great League of War and Survival}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leland Donald writes that captives “were killed if they could not keep up, tried to escape, or members of the attacking party could not restrain their emotions”.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=218}} [[Daniel K. Richter|Daniel Richter]] suggests that keeping the pace may not have been an easy task, writing that “warriors might slowly lead prisoners by a rope between the lines of men, women and children [captives]”.{{sfn|Richter|1992|p=67}} If a prisoner survived all the obstacles on the march back to a Haudenosaunee village, the torture did not end. Slaves were mutilated and beaten for several days upon arrival by Haudenosaunee warriors.{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=46}} After the initiation process, slaves were either killed, or welcomed into the nation where they would be replacing a deceased member of that community.{{sfn|Richter|1992|p=68}}

'''Adoption Policy'''

Slaves brought onto Haudenosaunee territory were mainly adopted into families or kin groups that had lost a person.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=218}} Although if that person had been vital for the community they “were usually replaced by other kin-group members” and “captives were…adopted to fill lesser places”.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=220}} During adoption rituals, slaves were to reject their former life and be renamed as part of their “genuine assimilation”.{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=42}} The key goal of Haudenosaunee slavery practices was to have slaves assimilate to Haudenosaunee culture to rebuild population after one or many deaths.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=220}} Children{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=51}}and Indigenous peoples of neighbouring villages{{sfn|Richter|1992|p=65}} to the Haudenosaunee are said to have been good slaves because of their better ability to assimilate. That being said, the role of a slave was not a limited position and whenever slaves were available for capture they were taken, no matter their age, race, gender etc.{{sfn|Richter|1992|p=60}}

Once adopted, slaves in Haudenosaunee communities had potential to move up in society.{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=41}} Since slaves were replacing dead nation members, they took on the role of that former member if they could prove that they could live up to it.{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=41}} Their rights within the aforementioned framework were still limited though, meaning slaves performed chores or labor for their adoptive families.{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=51}} Also, there are a few cases where slaves were never adopted into families and their only role was to perform tasks in the village.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=218}} These types of slaves may have been used solely for exchange.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=222}} Slave trade was common in Haudenosaunee culture and it aimed to increase Haudenosaunee population.{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=39}}

'''Torture'''

Slaves were often tortured once captured by the Haudenosaunee. Torture methods consisted of, most notably, finger mutilation, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://moses.creighton.edu/kripke/jesuitrelations/relations_30.html|title=Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents|last=Lalemant|first=Hierosme|publisher=The Burrows Brothers Company|year=1899|editor-last=Thwaites|editor-first=Reuben Gold|volume=30|location=Cleveland|pages=243|language=French, Latin, Italian|translator-last=Alexander|translator-first=Finlow|chapter=Of the Treachery of the Hiroquois|editor-last2=Blair|editor-first2=Emma Helen|translator-last2=Bicknell|translator-first2=Percy Favor|translator-last3=Giese|translator-first3=William Frederic|translator-last4=Lindsay|translator-first4=Crawford|translator-last5=Price|translator-first5=William|translator-last6=Sober|translator-first6=Hiram Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=43}} Slaves endured torture not only on their journey back to Haudenosaunee nations, but also during initiation rituals and sometimes throughout their enslavement.{{sfn|Richter|1992|p=68}} Finger mutilation was common as a sort of marking of a slave.{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|pp=44,47}} In "Northern Iroquoian Slavery", Starna and Watkins suggest that sometimes torture was so brutal that captives died before being adopted.{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=44}} Initial torture upon entry into the Haudenosaunee culture also involved binding, bodily mutilation with weapons, and starvation, and for female slaves: sexual assault.{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=43}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bonds of Alliance: Indigenous and Atlantic Slaveries in New France|last=Rushforth|first=Brett|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4696-0135-9|location=Chapel Hill|pages=17|chapter=I Make Him my Dog/my Slave}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Richter|1992|p=68}}{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=50}} Starvation may have lasted longer depending on the circumstance. [[Louis Hennepin]] was captured by Haudenosaunee peoples in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century and recalled being starved during his adoption as one of "Aquipaguetin"’s replacement sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/cihm_18329|title=A new Discovery of a Large Country in the Northern America, Extending Above Four Thousand Miles [microform]|last=Hennepin|first=Louis|publisher=[Worcester, Mass.? : s.n.|others=Canadiana.org|year=1820|location=|pages=87-88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous slaves were also starved by their captors, such as Louis Hennepin was.{{sfn|Rushforth|2012|p=17}} If torture lead to the slave’s death, often times Haudenosaunee peoples ate the victim.{{sfn|Lalemant|1899|p=243}}{{sfn|Hennepin|1820|p=66}} The brutality of Haudenosaunee slavery wasn’t without its purposes though; torture was used to demonstrate a power dynamic between the slave and the “master” to constantly remind the slave that they were inferior.{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|p=47}}{{sfn|Rushforth|2012|p=41}}

'''Language'''

Language played another role in Haudenosaunee slavery practices. Slaves were often referred to as "domestic animals" or "dogs" which were equivalent to the word to "slave".{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|pp=48-49}} This use of language suggests that slaves were dehumanized, that slaves were "domesticated" and another that slaves were to be eaten as Haudenosaunee peoples ate dogs.{{sfn|Rushforth|2012|pp=19,38}}{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|pp=47-49}} [[Jacques Bruyas|Jaques Bruyas]] wrote a dictionary of the [[Mohawk language]] where the word “Gatsennen” is defined as "Animal domestique, serviteur, esclave" the English translation being "domestic animal, butler, slave".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_50269/page/n111|title=Radical Words of the Mohawk Language with Their Derivatives [microform]|last=Bruyas|first=Jacques|publisher=[Albany, N.Y.? : s.n.]|others=Canadiana.org|year=1863|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also more language accounts of slaves being compared to animals (mostly dogs) in [[Oneida language|Oneida]] and [[Onondaga language|Onondaga language.]]{{sfn|Starna and Watkins|1991|pp=48-49}} This language not only serves as a proof that slavery did exist, but also that slaves were at the bottom of the hierarchy.{{sfn|Rushforth|2012|p=19}}

'''Changes After Contact'''

Inevitably, Haudenosaunee slavery practices changed after European contact. With the arrival of European diseases came the increase in Haudenosaunee peoples obtaining captives as their population kept decreasing.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=221}}{{sfn|Richter|1992|p=53}} During the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century, Haudenosaunee peoples banded together to stand against settlers.{{sfn|Parmenter|2007|p=40}} By the end of the century, Haudenosaunee populations were mostly made up of captives from other nations{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=222}}. Among the Indigenous groups targeted by the Haudenosaunee were the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] who were captured in such large numbers that they lost their independence for a large period of time.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=222}}{{sfn|Richter|1992|p=61}} “Mourning wars” became essential to rebuild numbers, but also Haudenosaunee warriors began targeting French and later English colonizers.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=222}}{{sfn|Richter|1992|p=64}} Similarly to Indigenous slaves, European slaves were tortured by the Haudenosaunee using finger mutilation and sometimes cannibalism.{{sfn|Lalemant|1899|p=243}} European captives did not make for good slaves though because they resisted even more so than Indigenous captives and they did not understand rituals such as renaming and forgetting their past.{{sfn|Richter|1992|pp=71-72}} For this reason most European captives were either used as ransom or murdered upon arrival to Haudenosaunee territory.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=222}} A lot of Europeans were not captured though, and instead they became trading partners with the Haudenosaunee.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=221}} Indigenous slaves were now being traded amongst European settlers and some slaves even ended up in Quebec households.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=221}} In the end, European contact lead to adoptees outnumbering the Haudenosaunee in their own communities, these slaves were too hard to control in large numbers and so came the finality of Haudenosaunee slavery practices.{{sfn|Donald|2011|p=222}}

According to the Worldmark Encyclopedia of Cultures and Daily Life, The Iroquois Confederacy had 10,000 people at its peak, but by the 18th century, their population had decreased to 4,000, recovering only to 7,000 by 1910.{{sfn|Daeg de Mott|2009}}

According to data compiled in 1995 by Doug George-Kanentiio, a total of 51,255 Six Nations people lived in Canada. These included 15,631 Mohawk in Quebec; 14,051 Mohawk in Ontario; 3,970 Oneida in Ontario; and a total of 17,603 of the Six Nations at the Grand River Reserve in Ontario.&lt;ref name="doug"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratical.org/many_worlds/6Nations/population95.html |author= Doug George-Kanentiio |title= Iroquois population 1995 | publisher =Akwesasne Notes New Series |date= Fall{{ndash}}Winter 1995 |issue= Volume 1 #3 &amp; 4 |pages= 61  |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently according to the Six Nations Elected Council, some 12,436 on the [[Six Nations of the Grand River]] [[Indian reserve|reserve]], the largest [[First Nations]] reserve in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sixnations.ca/CommunityProfile.htm Community Profile], Six Nations Elected Council, December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; as of December 2014 and 26,034 total in Canada.&lt;ref name=MMS&gt;[http://www.sixnations.ca/MembershipDept.htm Lands/Membership Department], Six Nations Elected Council, December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, tribal registrations among the Six Nations in the United States numbered about 30,000 in total, with the majority of 17,566 in New York. The remainder were more than 10,000 Oneida in Wisconsin, and about 2200 Seneca-Cayuga in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="doug"/&gt; As the nations individually determine their rules for membership or citizenship, they report the official numbers. (Some traditional members of the nations refuse to be counted.)&lt;ref name="doug"/&gt; There is no federally recognized Iroquois nation or tribe, nor are any Native Americans enrolled as Iroquois.

In the [[2000 United States Census|2000 United States census]], 80,822 people identified as having Iroquois ethnicity (which is similar to identifying as European), with 45,217 claiming only Iroquois ancestry. There are the several reservations in New York: [[Cayuga Nation of New York]](~450{{citation needed|date=September 2015}},) [[St. Regis Mohawk Reservation]] (3248 in 2014),&lt;ref name="USCensusEst2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/SUB-EST2014.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523034651/https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/SUB-EST2014.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 23, 2015 |title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2014 |accessdate=June 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Onondaga Reservation]] (473 in 2014),&lt;ref name="USCensusEst2014"/&gt; [[Oneida Indian Nation]] (~ 1000{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}), [[Seneca Nation of New York]] (~8000{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}) and the [[Tuscarora Reservation]] (1100 in 2010{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}). Some lived at the [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin]] on the reservation there counting some 21,000 according to the 2000 census.

==Government==
[[File:Six Nations survivors of War of 1812.jpg|thumb|Mohawk leader [[John Smoke Johnson]] (right) with John Tutela and Young Warner, two other Six Nations [[War of 1812]] veterans. Photo: July 1882]]

The ''Grand Council of the Six Nations'' is an assembly of 56 ''Hoyenah'' ([[Tribal chief|chief]]s) or [[sachem]]s. Today, the seats on the Council are distributed among the Six Nations as follows:
* 14 Onondaga
* 10 Cayuga
* {{spaces|2}}9 Oneida
* {{spaces|2}}9 Mohawk 
* {{spaces|2}}8 Seneca 
* {{spaces|2}}6 Tuscarora 
When anthropologist [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] studied the Grand Council in the 19th century, he interpreted it as a [[central government]]. This interpretation became influential, but Richter argues that while the Grand Council served an important ceremonial role, it was not a government in the sense that Morgan thought.&lt;ref name="Richter11-12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; According to this view, Iroquois political and diplomatic decisions are made on the local level, and are based on assessments of community [[consensus]]. A central government that develops policy and implements it for the people at large is not the Iroquois model of government.

Unanimity in public acts was essential to the Council. In 1855, Minnie Myrtle observed that no Iroquois treaty was binding unless it was ratified by 75% of the male voters and 75% of the mothers of the nation.&lt;ref name=Wagner/&gt; In revising Council laws and customs, a consent of two-thirds of the mothers was required.&lt;ref name=Wagner/&gt; The need for a double supermajority to make major changes made the Confederacy a ''de facto'' [[consensus government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morden|first1=Michael|title=Treaty Federalism as Conflict Management: Indigenous- Settler Power Sharing in Canada|url=http://www.unifr.ch/federalismnetwork/assets/files/Best%20Papers%202011/Morden%20-%20Treaty%20Federalism%20in%20Canada.pdf|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women traditionally held real power, particularly the power to veto treaties or declarations of war.&lt;ref name=Wagner&gt;{{cite book |last=Wagner |first=Sally Roesch |editor1-first=Ron |editor1-last=Sakolsky |editor2-first=James |editor2-last=Koehnline |title=Gone To Croatan: Origins of North American Dropout Culture |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/473653.Gone_to_Croatan |accessdate=2015-09-23 |year=1993 |publisher=Autonomedia |location=Brooklyn, New York |isbn=0-936756-92-6 |pages=240–247 |chapter=The Iroquois Influence on Women's Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Grand Council of Sachems were chosen by the mothers of each clan. If any leader failed to comply with the wishes of the women of his tribe and the Great Law of Peace, the mother of his clan could demote him, a process called "[[firing|knocking off the horns]]". The deer antlers, an emblem of leadership, were removed from his headgear, thus returning him to private life.&lt;ref name=Wagner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Eldridge, Larry D. |title=Women and freedom in early America |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |year=1997 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=CrpC9UXJe_MC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 15] |isbn=0-8147-2198-2 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Councils of the mothers of each tribe were held separately from the men's councils. The women used men as runners to send word of their decisions to concerned parties, or a woman could appear at the men's council as an orator, presenting the view of the women. Women often took the initiative in suggesting legislation.&lt;ref name=Wagner/&gt;

===Wampum belts===
{{See also|Wampum}}
[[File:Chiefs of the Six Nations at Brantford, Canada, explaining their wampum belts to Horatio Hale September 14, 1871.jpg|left|thumb|Chiefs of the Six Nations explaining their wampum belts to [[Horatio Hale]], 1871]]

The term "wampum" refers to beads made from purple and white mollusk shells on threads of elm bark.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=36}} Species used to make wampum include the highly prized [[hard clam|quahog clam]] (''Mercenaria mercenaria'') which produces the famous purple colored beads. For white colored beads the shells from the [[channeled whelk]] (''Busycotypus canaliculatus''), [[knobbed whelk]] (''Busycon carica''), [[lightning whelk]] (''Sinistrofulgur perversum''), and [[Sinistrofulgur|snow whelk]] (''Sinistrofulgur laeostomum'') are used.&lt;ref name="wampum&amp;wampumbelts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ganondagan.org/wampum.html|title=Wampum &amp; Wampum Belts|publisher=Ganondagan|accessdate=2013-01-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721100104/http://www.ganondagan.org/wampum.html|archivedate=2012-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wampum was primarily used to make wampum belts by the Iroquois, which Iroquois tradition claims was invented by Hiawatha to console chiefs and clan mothers who lost family members to war.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=36}} Wampum belts played a major role in the Condolence Ceremony and in the raising of new chiefs.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=36}} Wampum belts are used to signify the importance of a specific message being presented. Treaty making often involved wampum belts to signify the importance of the treaty.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=36}} A famous example is "[[Two Row Wampum Treaty|The Two Row Wampum]]" or "Guesuenta", meaning "it brightens our minds", which was originally presented to the Dutch settlers, and then French, representing a canoe and a sailboat moving side-by-side along the river of life, not interfering with the other's course. All non-Native settlers are, by associations, members of this treaty. Both chiefs and clan mothers wear wampum belts as symbol of their offices.{{sfn|Johnson|2003|p=36}}

"The Covenant Belt" was presented to the Iroquois at the signing of the [[Treaty of Canandaigua|Canandaigua Treaty]]. The belt has a design of thirteen human figures representing symbolically the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of the United States. The house and the two figures directly next to the house represent the Iroquois people and the symbolic longhouse. The figure on the left of the house represent the Seneca Nation who are the symbolic guardians of the western door (western edge of Iroquois territory) and the figure to the right of the house represents the Mohawk who are the keepers of the eastern door (eastern edge of Iroquois territory).&lt;ref name="wampum&amp;wampumbelts"/&gt;

The Hiawatha belt is the national belt of the Iroquois and is represented in the Iroquois Confederacy flag. The belt has four squares and a tree in the middle which represents the original five nations of the Iroquois. Going from left to right the squares represent the Seneca, Cayuga, Oneida and Mohawk. The Onondaga are represented by an [[eastern white pine]] which represents the [[Tree of Peace]]. Traditionally the Onondaga are the peace keepers of the confederacy. The placement of the nations on the belt represents the actually geographical distribution of the six nations over their shared territory, with the Seneca in the far west and the Mohawk in the far east of Iroquois territory.&lt;ref name="wampum&amp;wampumbelts"/&gt;
[[File:Flag of the Iroquois Confederacy.svg|thumb|Haudenosaunee flag.]]
The Haudenosaunee flag created in the 1980s is  based on the Hiawatha Belt ... created from purple and white wampum beads centuries ago to symbolize the union forged when the former enemies buried their weapons under the Great Tree of Peace."&lt;ref name="flagwampum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/28214379.html|title=From beads to banner |publisher=Indian Country Today |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the original five nations that were united by the [[The Great Peacemaker|Peacemaker]] and Hiawatha. The [[tree]] symbol in the center represents an [[Eastern White Pine]], the needles of which are clustered in groups of five.&lt;ref name="iroquoisflag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.arizona.edu/ic/kmartin/School/iroqflag.htm |title=Haudenosaunee Flag |publisher=First Americans |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on the United States===
Historians in the 20th century have suggested the Iroquois system of government influenced the development of the United States's government.{{citation needed|date=December 2016|reason=What historians?}} Contact between the leaders of the English colonists and the Iroquois started with efforts to form an alliance via the use of treaty councils. Prominent individuals such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were often in attendance.{{citation needed|date=December 2016|reason=If this is true, there would be sources}} Bruce Johansen proposes that the Iroquois had a representative form of government.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, Bruce E. Forgotten Founders: Benjamin Franklin, The Iroquois, And The Rationale For The American Revolution. Ipswich, Mass. : Gambit, 1981. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Six Nations' governing committee was elected by the men and women of the tribe, one member from each of the six nations. Giving each member the same amount of authority in the council ensured no man received too much power, providing some of the same effect as the United States's future system of checks and balances.{{citation needed|date=December 2016|reason=This is a reasonable opinion, but whose opinion is it?}}

Consensus has not been reached on how influential the Iroquois model was to the development of United States' documents such as the [[Articles of Confederation]] and the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name=danile_usner_1992&gt;{{cite book  | last = Armstrong  | first = VI | title = I Have Spoken: American History Through the Voices of the Indians | publisher = Swallow Press| page = 14 | isbn= 0-8040-0530-3  | year = 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence thesis has been discussed by historians such as [[Donald A.

Res. 331, October 21, 1988 | publisher=United States Senate}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, [[Cornell University]] held a conference on the link between the Iroquois' government and the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kahonwes.com/iroquois/document1.html | accessdate=2012-05-20 | title=The Tree of Peace The Great Law of Peace: New World Roots of American Democracy by David Yarrow© September 1987 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703193225/http://www.kahonwes.com/iroquois/document1.html | archive-date=2012-07-03 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Jack N. Rakove]] challenge this thesis. [[Stanford University]] historian Rakove writes, "The voluminous records we have for the constitutional debates of the late 1780s contain no significant references to the Iroquois" and notes that there are ample European precedents to the democratic institutions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hnn.us/articles/12974.html | title=Did the Founding Fathers Really Get Many of Their Ideas of Liberty from the Iroquois? | publisher=[[George Mason University]] | accessdate=2011-01-05 | last = Rakove | first = J | date = 2005-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Francis Jennings]] noted that supporters of the thesis frequently cite the following statement by [[Benjamin Franklin]], made in a letter from Benjamin Franklin to James Parker in 1751:&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, Bruce E. Forgotten Founders: Benjamin Franklin, The Iroquois, And The 	Rationale For The American Revolution. Ipswich, Mass. : Gambit, 1981. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; "It would be a very strange thing, if six Nations of ignorant savages should be capable of forming a Scheme for such a Union ... and yet that a like union should be impracticable for ten or a Dozen English Colonies," but he disagrees that it establishes influence. Rather, he thinks Franklin was promoting union against the "ignorant savages" and called the idea "absurd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jennings F | authorlink = Francis Jennings |title=Empire of fortune: crown, colonies, and tribes in the Seven Years War in America |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VsBPyRfdHEAC&amp;pg=PA259#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 259n15] |isbn=0-393-30640-2 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anthropologist]] Dean Snow has stated that although Franklin's [[Albany Plan]] may have drawn inspiration from the Iroquois League, there is little evidence that either the Plan or the Constitution drew substantially from that source. He argues that "... such claims muddle and denigrate the subtle and remarkable features of Iroquois government. The two forms of government are distinctive and individually remarkable in conception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Snow DR |title=The Iroquois (The Peoples of America Series) |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1996 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=P7e82KQoX6IC&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 154] |isbn=1-55786-938-3 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the anthropologist [[Elizabeth Tooker]] has concluded that "there is virtually no evidence that the framers borrowed from the Iroquois." She argues that the idea is a myth resulting from a claim made by linguist and ethnographer [[John Napoleon Brinton Hewitt|J.N.B. Hewitt]] that was exaggerated and misunderstood after his death in 1937.&lt;ref name="Tooker"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Clifton JA |title=The Invented Indian: Cultural Fictions and Government Policies |publisher=Transaction Publishers |location=New Brunswick, N.J., U.S.A |year=1990 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ARbVmr941TsC&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 107–128] | chapter = The United States Constitution and the Iroquois League |isbn=1-56000-745-1 |oclc= |doi= | author = Tooker E}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tooker, the original Iroquois constitution did not involve representative democracy and elections; deceased chiefs' successors were selected by the most senior woman within the hereditary lineage in consultation with other women in the tribe.&lt;ref name="Tooker"/&gt;

The Haudenosaunee government has issued passports since 1923, when Haudenosaunee authorities issued a passport to Cayuga statesman Deskaheh ([[Levi General]]) to travel to the League of Nations headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/home/content/Iroquois-Nationals-forfeits-first-game-98603364.html |title=Indian Country Today Media Network.com |publisher=Indiancountrytoday.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, passports have been issued since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', July 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2001 these were accepted by various nations for international travel, but with increased security concerns across the world since the [[September 11 attacks]], this is no longer the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/15/iroquois-lacrosse-team-passports-visa-us-uk |title=Iroquois lacrosse team cleared to travel by America – then blocked by Britain |first=Ewen |last=MacAskill |work=The Guardian |date=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They called their confederation '''Ganonsyoni''', which means "The Lodge Extended Lengthwise", that is, a lodge that is "spread out far". All individuals and all the tribes of the Confederacy were considered as one family living together in one lodge. The Mohawks, dwelling furthest east, were Keepers of the Western Door. The Onondagas, situated in the center, were the Fire Keepers as well as the Wampam Keepers. Onondaga was therefore, the capital, where the Grand Council was held and wampum records were kept. The local clan chiefs of each tribe meeting together as a unit were the federal chiefs of the League. The Mohawks, Onondagas, and Senecas were the Elder Brothers; The Oneidas and Cayugas, the Younger Brothers. The younger and elder brethren sat on opposite sides of the lodge and counseled across the fire with each other. The Onondagas sat in the middle and kept the balance between the two sides.&lt;br /&gt;The date of the founding of the league is lost in antiquity. Historians and anthropologists have made estimates that range all the way from 1450 to 1660. Indian tradition follows the earlier date and assigns the founding to the work of two remarkable individuals. One was Deganawida, a Huron adopted by the Mohawks. The other was Hiawatha, his spokesman, an Onondaga who was also adopted by the Mohawks. ...

The '''Jubilee''' ({{lang-he-n|יובל}} ''yōḇel;'' [[Yiddish]]: ''yoyvl'') is the year at the end of seven cycles of ''[[shmita]]'' (Sabbatical years), and according to [[Bible|Biblical]] regulations had a special impact on the ownership and management of land in the [[Land of Israel]]; there is some debate whether it was the 49th year (the last year of seven sabbatical cycles, referred to as the Sabbath's Sabbath), or whether it was the following (50th) year. Jubilee deals largely with land, property, and property rights. According to Leviticus, slaves and prisoners would be freed, debts would be forgiven, and the mercies of God would be particularly manifest.  {{bibleref2|Leviticus|25:8-13|WEB}} states:
{{quote|You shall count off seven Sabbaths of years, seven times seven years; and there shall be to you the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years. Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout all your land. You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee to you; and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family. That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. In it you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself, nor gather from the undressed vines. For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat of its increase out of the field. In this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return to his property. ([[World English Bible|WEB]])}}

The biblical rules concerning Sabbatical years (''shmita'') are still observed by many religious [[Jews]] in [[Israel]], but the regulations for the Jubilee year have not been observed for many centuries. According to the Torah, observance of Jubilee only applies when the Jewish people live in the land of Israel according to their tribes. Thus, with the exile of the [[Israelites|tribes]] of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] (about 600 BCE), Jubilee has not been applicable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/196/Q3/ Yovel | Yovel | Jubilee Year]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Septuagint]] rendered the Hebrew ''yovel'' as "a trumpet-blast of liberty" (ἀφέσεως σημασία ''afeseos semasia''), and the [[Vulgate]] by Latin ''[[:wikt:iobeleus|iobeleus]]''. Traditionally, it was thought that the English term ''Jubilee'' derives from the Hebrew term ''yobel'' (via Latin ''{{lang|la|Jubilaeus}}''), which in turn derives from ''yobhel'', meaning ''ram'';&lt;ref&gt;''[[needs citation]]''&lt;/ref&gt; the Jubilee year was announced by a blast on a [[shofar]], an instrument made from a ram's horn, during that year's [[Yom Kippur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Leviticus|25:9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative etymology notes that the Latin verb ''[[:wikt:iubilo|iūbilō]]'', "shout for joy," predates the [[Vulgate]], and proposes that instead the Latin ''jubilo'' (meaning ''shout''), as well as Middle Irish ''ilach'' (victory cry), New English ''yowl'', and Ancient Greek ''iuzo'' (ἰύζω: shout), derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*yu-'' (shout for joy).&lt;ref&gt;[[J. P. Mallory|Mallory, J. P.]] and [[Douglas Q. Adams|Adams, D. Q.]] (2006). ''The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World'' New York: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-929668-2}}, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, the Hebrew term for "jubilee" is a borrowing from neighboring Indo-European languages, rather than deriving from another Hebrew word.

==Origin and purpose==
{{quote|This fiftieth year is sacred—it is a time of freedom and of celebration when everyone will receive back their original property, and slaves will return home to their families.|{{bibleref2|Leviticus|25:10|CEV}} ([[Contemporary English Version|CEV]] &amp;mdash; free translation)}}
{{quote|And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.|[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0325.htm Leviticus 25:10] (Jewish Publication Society translation &amp;mdash; more precise translation)}}
Ancient Near Eastern societies regularly declared noncommercial debts void, typically at the coronation of a new king or at the king’s order.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Graeber|Graeber. David]]. [[Debt: The First 5000 Years]]. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical scholars once argued that the Jubilee was an obvious development of the Sabbatical year.&lt;ref name="Cheyne_Black"/&gt; Rather than waiting for the 50th or 49th year, the [[Deuteronomic Code]] requires that Hebrew slaves be liberated during their 7th year of service,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|15:12|}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the [[Covenant Code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:2-6|}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some [[textual criticism|textual scholars]] regard as pre-dating the [[Holiness code]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Book of Ezekiel]], which some textual scholars also regard as earlier than the Holiness Code, refers to a ''year of liberty'' (&lt;big&gt;שנת דרור&lt;/big&gt;), during which property is returned to the original owner (or their heirs),&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|46:17|}}&lt;/ref&gt; (earlier written mentioning in Sum: ama-gi, ama-ar-gi, 'return to the mother') but the word &lt;big&gt;דרור&lt;/big&gt; is used by [[Jeremiah]] to describe the release of slaves during the Sabbatical year,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|34:14-15|}}&lt;/ref&gt; which various scholars take to imply that Ezekiel must have been referring to the sabbatical year.&lt;ref name="Cheyne_Black"/&gt; Scholars suspect that the transfer of these regulations to 49th or 50th year was a deliberate attempt to parallel the fact that [[Shavuot]] is 50 days after [[Passover]], and follows [[Counting of the Omer|seven weeks of harvest]];&lt;ref name="Cheyne_Black"/&gt; this parallel is regarded as significant in [[Kabbalah]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

According to the theories of [[Julius Wellhausen]] and others who have followed his approach, the Biblical chapters that contain the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation (chapters 25 and 27 of Leviticus) were part of the so-called "P" or [[Priestly Code]] that represented the last stage in the development of Israel's religion.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Wellhausen, ''Prolegomena to the History of Ancient Israel'' (New York: Meridian Books, 1957) 117-120. Originally published as ''Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels'' (Berlin, 1882; Eng. trans., 1885; 5th German edition, 1899; first published in 1878 as ''Geschichte Israels'').&lt;/ref&gt; If Wellhausen's theories of the formation of the Biblical canon were to be accepted, it would mean that these chapters necessarily were written in a late exilic or post-exilic period.

Wellhausen's theory that the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation was written in the [[Babylonian captivity|exilic]] or post-exilic period, specifically after the time of Ezekiel, has always been challenged by scholars who have maintained the traditional position of Judaism and Christianity for the Mosaic authorship of Leviticus. Recently, however, the theories of Wellhausen and others who date the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation to the exilic period or later have also been challenged by scholars who generally do not have a conservative view of the Bible. Yehezekel Kaufmann has argued that the book of Ezekiel quotes from the Sabbatical and Jubilee legislation of the [[Book of Leviticus]], which must have been in existence before Ezekiel's writings.&lt;ref&gt;Yehezekel Kaufmann, ''The Religion of Israel from its Beginning to the Babylonian Exile'' (trans. M. Greenberg; New York: Schocken Books, 1972) 433-435.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been expanded by Risa Levitt Kohn. Kohn examined in detail the 97 terms and phrases that are shared between Ezekiel and the Priestly Code.{{sfn|Kohn|2002a|p=30–85}}{{sfn|Kohn|2002b}} She concludes:
{{quote|In each of these examples, the direction of influence moves from P to Ezekiel. A term or expression with a positive connotation in P takes on a negative overtone in Ezekiel&amp;#133;Ezekiel parodies P language by using terms antithetically. It is virtually impossible to imagine that the Priestly Writer would have composed Israelite history by transforming images of Israel's apostasy and subsequent downfall from Ezekiel into images conveying the exceptional covenant and unique relationship between Israel and YHWH. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine that the Priestly Writer could have turned Ezekiel's land of exile (&lt;big&gt;ארץ מגוריהם&lt;/big&gt;) into Israel's land of promise, Israel's enemies (&lt;big&gt;קהל עמים&lt;/big&gt;) in to a sign of fecundity, or Israel's abundant sin (&lt;big&gt;במאד מאד&lt;/big&gt;) into a sign of YHWH's covenant. It is, however, plausible that Ezekiel, writing in exile, re-evaluated P's portrayal of Israel's uniqueness, cynically inverting these images so that what was once a "pleasing fragrance to YHWH" symbolizes impiety and irreverence.{{sfn|Kohn|2002a|p=84–85}}}}

John Bergsma provides a further argument against an exilic or post-exilic date for the codifying of the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation, saying that the ''[[Sitz im Leben]]'' (life situation) of the exilic or post-exilic period is not at all addressed by this legislation.
{{quote|Finally, if the only purpose of the jubilee legislation was to serve as a pretext for the return of the exiles' lands, certainly much simpler laws than the jubilee could have been written and ascribed to Moses. All that would be necessary is a short statement mandating the return of property to any Israelite who returned after being exiled. In point of fact, ''precisely such brief, pointed laws are extant in the Mesopotamian codes'', for example, the code of Hammurabi §27 and the Laws of Eshnuna §29. But on the contrary, the jubilee legislation ''never addresses the situation of exile''. The only form of land alienation addressed in the text is sale by owner. If the priesthood in the early Persian period really wanted a legal pretext for the return of lost lands, ''they would surely have written themselves a law that directly addressed their situation''.&lt;ref&gt;John Sietze Bergsma, ''The Jubilee from Leviticus to Qumran: A History of Interpretation'' (Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2007) 77. Italics are in the original.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bergsma therefore points out the incongruity of Wellhausen's ascribing an exilic or post-exilic date to the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation, since this would conflict with the ''Sitz im Leben'' of Israel during, and after, the exile. In addition, Bergsma shows that the problem that this legislation was addressing was a problem recognized by the kings of Babylon in the second millennium BC, which naturally suggests the possibility of a much earlier date of codification. These Babylonian kings (to whom could be added [[Ammi-Saduqa]]&lt;ref&gt;James B. Pritchard, ed., ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969) 526-528.&lt;/ref&gt;) occasionally issued decrees for the cancellation of debts and/or the return of the people to the lands they had sold. Such "clean slate" decrees were intended to redress the tendency of debtors, in ancient societies, to become hopelessly in debt to their creditors, thus accumulating most of the arable land into the control of a wealthy few. The decrees were issued sporadically. Economist [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]] maintains that the Biblical legislation of the Jubilee and Sabbatical years addressed the same problems encountered by these Babylonian kings, but the Biblical formulation of the laws presented a significant advance in justice and the rights of the people. This was due to the "clean slates" now being codified into law, rather than relying on the whim of the king. Furthermore, the regular rhythm of the Sabbatical and Jubilee years meant that everyone would know when the next release was due, thereby giving fairness and equity to both creditor and debtor.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hudson, "The Lost Tradition of Biblical Debt Cancellations," research paper at the Hentry George School of Social Science (New York: 1992) 35-37, available [http://www.Michael-hudson.com here.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hudson|1999|p=30–31}} Hudson therefore maintains that not only was the Levitical legislation a significant advance over the prior attempts to deal with indebtedness, but this legislation was also eminently practical, in contradiction to many Biblical interpreters who are not economists and who have labeled it "utopian."

== Regulations ==
The biblical regulations concerning the Jubilee year form part of the [[Holiness code]], which appears in the [[Torah]] as part of the collections of laws given on [[Mount Sinai]] or Mount Horeb. According to these regulations,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Jubilee was to be sounded once 49 years had been counted,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:8|}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising an ambiguity over whether the Jubilee was within the 49th year, or followed it as an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] in the 7-year sabbatical cycles; scholars and [[Rabbinic literature|classical rabbinical sources]] are divided on the question.&lt;ref name="Cheyne_Black"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

The biblical requirement is that the Jubilee year was to be treated like a Sabbatical year, with the land lying fallow, but also required the compulsory return of all property to its original owners or their heirs, except the houses of laymen within walled cities, in addition to the manumission of all Israelite [[indentured servant]]s.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

The biblical regulations state that the land was to rest a "Sabbath" when the Children of Israel came to the land God was giving them Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] (second century AD), stated that this verse meant that the counting was not to start until after the Israelites had gained control of Canaan, which the Seder Olam, based upon received tradition, placed at 14 years after their entry into the land.&lt;ref&gt;''Seder Olam Rabbah'', chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation has been largely adopted in later rabbinic scholarship. One reason for this interpretation of the Levitical text was that if counting started before the land was completely conquered, it would require the Israelites to return the land to the Canaanites within 50 years; similar nationalistic concerns about the impact of the Jubilee on land ownership have been raised by [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Israeli settlement|settlers]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; From a legal point of view, the Jubilee law effectively banned sale of land as [[fee simple]], and instead land could only be [[lease]]d for no more than 50 years. The biblical regulations go on to specify that the price of land had to be proportional to how many years remained before the Jubilee, with land being cheaper the closer it is to the Jubilee.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:14-17|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Length of the Jubilee cycle==
Since the 49th year was already a sabbatical year, the land was required to be left fallow during it, but if the 50th year also had to be kept fallow, as the Jubilee, then no new crops would be available for two years, and only the summer fruits would be available for the following year, creating a much greater risk of starvation overall;&lt;ref name="Cheyne_Black"&gt;Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judah the Prince]] contended that the jubilee year was identical with the sabbatical 49th year.&lt;ref&gt;Talmudic tractate ''Rosh Hashanah'' 9a&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of classical rabbis believed that the biblical phrase ''hallow the fiftieth year'',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:10|}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with the biblical promise that there would be three years worth of fruit in the ''sixth year'',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:21|}}&lt;/ref&gt; implies that the jubilee year was the 50th year.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The opinion of the [[Geonim]], and generally of later authorities, was that prior to the [[Babylonian captivity]] the Jubilee was the intercalation of the 50th year, but after the captivity ended the Jubilee was essentially ignored, except for the blast of the [[shofar]], and coincided with the sabbatical 49th year;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; the reason was that the Jubilee was only to be observed when the Jews controlled all of Canaan, including the territories of Reuben and Gad and the eastern half-tribe of Manasseh.

The length of the Jubilee cycle continues to be of interest to modern scholarship, as does the question of the practicality of the legislation, and whether it was ever put into effect on a nationwide basis. Regarding the length of the cycle, three significant scholarly studies devoted to the Jubilee and Sabbatical years agree that it was 49 years, while disagreeing somewhat on the interpretation of the other issues involved. These major studies were those of Benedict Zuckermann,&lt;ref&gt;Benedict Zuckermann, ''Treatise on the Sabbatical Cycle and the Jubilee'', trans. A Löwy; (New York: Hermon, 1974); originally published as "Ueber Sabbatjahrcyclus und Jobelperiode," in ''Jarhesbericht des jüdisch-theologischen Seminars "Fraenckelscher Stiftung"'' (Breslau, 1857).&lt;/ref&gt; Robert North,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|North|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jean-François Lefebvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lefebvre|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons given by these authors to support a 49-year cycle are both textual (examining all relevant Biblical texts) and practical.

Calendrical document 4Q319 from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] "represents a calendrical system based on the weekly rotation of the twenty-four priestly courses during a six-year period and constructed into six consecutive Jubilees, i.e. 294 years.".&lt;ref&gt;Geza Vermes, "The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English" ({{ISBN|0-14-027807-9}}), Calendric Signs (Otot) pp. 352-356.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textual and practical considerations===
An example of the textual argument is given by North in his comparison of {{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:15-16|}} with {{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:8-11|}}. The first passage establishes the timing, in days, for the Festival of Weeks (''[[Shavuot]]''), while the second prescribes the timing, in years, for the Jubilee.&lt;ref name="North_131"&gt;{{harvp|North|1954|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first passage, the start of counting for the Festival of Weeks is said to be "the day after the Sabbath" (''mimaharat ha-shabat'', {{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:15|}}), and is to end "the day after the seventh Sabbath" (''mimaharat ha-shabat ha-sheviyit'', {{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:16|}}). These seven weeks would constitute 49 days in most modern methods of reckoning.  Nevertheless, verse 16 says that they are to be reckoned as 50 days. This method of reckoning (sometimes called "inclusive numbering") is fairly common in Scripture; for example, the Feast of Tabernacles is to last for seven days ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:34-36|}}), but the last day is called the eighth day (v. 36). North found this comparison between Leviticus 23 (Feast of Weeks) and Leviticus 25 (Jubilees) to be "the strongest possible support for the ''forty-ninth'' year"&lt;ref name="North_131"/&gt; as the Jubilee year. His conclusion that the Jubilee was identical with the seventh Sabbatical year was followed by Lefebvre, for this as well as additional reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lefebvre|2003|pp=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consideration that the Jubilee was identical with the seventh Sabbatical year solves the various practical problems, as also addressed by these authors. If the Jubilee were separate from, and following the seventh Sabbatical year, then there would be two fallow years in succession. Lefebvre points out, however, that there is no support in Scripture for two voluntary fallow years in succession, even though some have misinterpreted {{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:21-22|}} as if this refers to a Jubilee year following a Sabbatical year, which is not the sense of the passage. Lefebvre shows that this cannot be the case because planting is mentioned for the eighth year; it is the year after a Sabbath, a year in which planting and harvesting resume.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lefebvre|2003|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another practical problem that would occur if the Jubilee cycle were 50 years is that, after the first cycle, the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles would be out of phase unless the seventh Sabbatical cycle was stretched to eight years. But Scripture gives no instructions for making such an adjustment. Instead, it is assumed that the two cycles will always be in phase so that the ''shofar'' can be sounded in the seventh year of the seventh Sabbatical cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lefebvre|2003|pp=159, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the consideration that the Jubilee year is an intercalated year separate and distinct from the Sabbatical cycles resolves an issue of the requirement for observation of the Torah of both {{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:3|}} and {{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:11|}}.  For in the former passage, the command is that sowing and pruning must occur for 6 consecutive years, whereas in the latter, the command is to neither sow, nor reap nor gather from untended vines in the Jubilee year.  If the Jubilee year is the 50th year as confirmed by {{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:10-11|}}, it must necessarily be a separate year from the first 49 years comprising the whole of the first seven Sabbatical cycles, therefore it cannot be identical with the seventh Sabbatical year as 49 does not equal 50.  Were the Jubilee year to be considered identical with year 1 of the following Sabbatical cycle, the requirement of observing 6 consecutive years of sowing and pruning could not be observed as only 5 years would therefore be available for sowing and reaping, not the specified six as {{bibleverse||Leviticus|25:3|}} requires. A lot of the misunderstanding is from not carefully reading the original Hebrew text. There was no requirement in the Law to observe 6 consecutive years of sowing. The command stated that you may sow for 6 years but in the 7th year the land must observe a sabbath rest. It would be a double negative to command the land to be sowed for 6 years in cases of famine and war.

===Historical considerations===
Although not cited by these authors, two historical arguments also argue for a 49-year cycle. The first is that the Samaritans celebrated a 49-year cycle.&lt;ref&gt;A. Neubauer, ''Chronique Samairitaine'' (1873), 3, 8 ff., cited in ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' (Jerusalem, Keter, 1972), 14.579.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Samaritans stopped counting for the Jubilee some hundreds of years ago, according to a recent report an effort is underway to determine the date when counting ceased in order to resume. The counting will again be according to a 49-year cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Young|2006|loc=p. 78, n. 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second historical argument has been presented to the effect that the two instances of a Jubilee mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (tractates ''Arakin'' 12a and ''Megillah'' 14b) appear to be proper historical remembrances, because the known calculation methods of rabbinic scholarship were incapable of correctly calculating the dates of the Jubilees mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Young|2006|pp=76-77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbinic (Talmudic) scholarship always assumed non-accession reckoning for kings, whereby the first partial year of a king was double-counted both for him and as the last year of the deceased king. This reckoning would give 47 years from the Jubilee mentioned in the 18th year of Josiah (''Megillah'' 14b) to the Jubilee that took place 14 years after Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians (''Arakin'' 12a), whereas the correct difference was 49 years (623 BC to 574 BC). This has been presented as additional evidence that the cycle was 49 years, and further that the cycles were being measured until the last Jubilee in the days of Ezekiel, when the stipulations of the Jubilee year, long neglected except in the counting of the priests, could no longer be observed because the people were captive in a foreign land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Young|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The date when counting began==
The [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] recognized the importance of the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles as a long-term calendrical system, and attempted at various places to fit the Sabbatical and Jubilee years into its chronological scheme. As mentioned above, the Seder Olam put forth the idea that the counting for these cycles was deferred until 14 years after entry into the land. The reasons for this are given in Seder Olam chapter 11. In Joshua chapter 14, Caleb mentions that he was 40 years old when he was sent out as a spy in the second year in the wilderness, and his present age was 85 (Joshua 14:7,10), which meant he received his inheritance seven years after entering Canaan. Rabbi Jose assumed that everyone else received their inheritance when Caleb did, or had already received it, so that the allotment of the land to the tribes was finished at this time. Because the division of the land took seven years, the conquest that followed must also have taken seven years. "One has to say that 14 years Israel spent at Gilgal, seven when they were conquering and seven when they were distributing." Then, after putting up the Tabernacle at Shiloh, "At that moment, they started to count years for tithes, Sabbatical years, and Jubilee years."&lt;ref&gt;Seder Olam chapter 11, translation by Heinrich W. Guggenheimer, ''Seder Olam: The Rabbinic View of Biblical Chronology'' (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation has been offered for Rabbi Jose's postponement of counting until 14 years had elapsed. In this same chapter 11 of the Seder Olam, Rabbi Jose stated (for unknown reasons) that Israel's time in its land must have lasted an integral number of Jubilee periods. If this were true, one of those periods should have ended at the beginning of the exile in 587 BC. Yet Rabbi Jose also believed that Ezekiel 40:1 marked the beginning of the seventeenth Jubilee, and this was 14 years after the city fell. In other words, the Jubilee came 14 years too late, according to the idea that the time in the land must comprise an integral number of Jubilee cycles. Rodger Young proposes that the knowledge of when a genuine Jubilee was due was the real reason for the supposition of a delay before the start of counting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reason for the fourteen-year delay in ''Seder ‘Olam'' 11 is that Rabbi Yose (primary author of the ''Seder ‘Olam'') had the ''idée fixe'' that the total time that Israel spent in its land must come out to an exact number of Jubilee cycles. If that had been the case, then we should have expected that 587 BC, when the exile began, would have been at the end of a Jubilee period. However, Rabbi Yose cited Ezek 40:1 as designating the time of the seventeenth Jubilee, and since he knew this was fourteen years after the city fell, he presumed that counting had been delayed for fourteen years so that he could account for the fourteen years between the fall of the city and the observance of the seventeenth Jubilee. He also mentioned the previous Jubilee, in the time of Josiah. As much as he would have liked to put these last two Jubilees fourteen years earlier in order to be consistent with his ''idée fixe'', Rabbi Yose could not do it because he knew these were historical dates, not dates that came from his own calculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Young|2007|loc=p. 178, n. 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is, of course, an alternative account of when counting started: at the entry into the land. This follows from a straightforward reading of the relevant text in Leviticus: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The {{Lord}} then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying, "Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'When you come into the land which I shall give you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the {{Lord}}. Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its crop, but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, a sabbath to the {{Lord}} . . . You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of years, ''namely'', forty-nine years. You shall then sound a ram's horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land. You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you (Leviticus 25:1-4, 8-10, NASB).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If counting is measured back 17 cycles from Ezekiel's Jubilee that began in Tishri of 574 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Young|2007|pp=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first year of the first cycle would have been 1406 BC. According to the religious calendar that started the year in Nisan, and in accordance with Joshua 5:10 that places the entry in the land in Nisan, Nisan of 1406 BC is the month and year when counting started. But 1406 BC is the year of entry into the land that is traditionally derived by another method, namely taking Thiele's date of 931/930 BC for the start of the divided kingdom after Solomon's death, in conjunction with 1 Kings 6:1 (Solomon's fourth year was 480th year of Exodus-era), to derive the date of the Exodus in 1446 BC. The method of determining the date of the Exodus and entry into Canaan from the Jubilee cycles is independent of the method of deriving these dates from 1 Kings 6:1, yet the two methods agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Young|2007|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological significance==
The text of the Book of Leviticus argues that the Jubilee existed because the land was the possession of [[Yahweh]], and its current occupiers were merely aliens or tenants, and therefore the land should not be sold forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Leviticus|25:23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Midrash]]ic sources argue that the Jubilee was created to preserve the original division of land between the [[Israelites|Israelite tribes]],&lt;ref name="Sifra, Behar Sinai, 7:1"&gt;Sifra, Behar Sinai, 7:1&lt;/ref&gt; as evidenced by the rabbinical tradition that the Jubilee should not be imposed until the Israelites were in control of Canaan.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; Leviticus also states that the Israelites were the servants of Yahweh,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Leviticus|25:55}}&lt;/ref&gt; which classical rabbis took as justification for the manumission of Israelite slaves at the Jubilee, using the argument that no man should have two masters, and thus, as the servants of Yahweh, the Israelites should not also be the servants of men.&lt;ref name="Sifra, Behar Sinai, 7:1"/&gt;

A further theological insight afforded by the Jubilee cycles is explained in Andrew Steinmann’s monograph on Biblical chronology. Steinmann has an extended discussion of the evidence for various pre-exilic Sabbatical years, and how they all occurred an integral number of seven-year periods before Ezekiel’s Jubilee (see the [[Historical Sabbatical Years]] article). He also notes that the date of the entry into the land implied by Ezekiel’s Jubilee (the seventeenth) is in exact agreement with the date calculated from 1 Kings 6:1 and Joshua 5:6. These chronological considerations are usually neglected in discussions of the legislation for the Jubilee and Sabbatical years, but Steinmann stresses their theological importance as follows:
{{quote|This illustrates one of the principles stated in the preface to the present book: that some historical insights will remain obscured until  the chronology of the period under discussion is determined properly. The Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles provide such historical insight. But they  do more: they also offer theological insights on  such important matters as the date and historicity of the Exodus and the origin of the Book of Leviticus. If, as has been argued, the times of the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles were known all the time that Israel was in its land, and, further, that the only adequate explanation that has yet been given for Ezekiel’s Jubilee being the seventeenth Jubilee is that the counting for these cycles actually started 832 years earlier, in 1406 BC, then it is logical to conclude the Lev 25–27, the texts that charter the Sabbatical years and the Jubilees, were in existence in the late fifteenth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew E. Steinmann, ''From Abraham to Paul: A Biblical Chronology'' (St. Louis: Concordia, 2011) 53.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Kindler v Canada (Minister of Justice)''''' &lt;ref&gt;[1991] 2 S.C.R. 779 {{Cite CanLII|source=scc|year=1991|num=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a landmark decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] where it was held that the government policy that allowed for [[extradition]] of convicted criminals to a country where they may face the [[death penalty]] was valid under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. The Court repeated this finding in ''[[Reference re Ng Extradition]]'' in 1991.  However, ''Kindler'' was essentially overruled in 2001 with ''[[United States v. Burns]]''.

After being convicted of murder in [[Pennsylvania]], Joseph Kindler escaped and fled to Canada.  He was captured, escaped again and was captured again.  Kindler then fought his extradition.  In a four-to-three decision the Court found that there was no violation of [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]] of the Charter (the [[right to life]], [[liberty]] and [[security of person]]) or [[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 12]] of the Charter (protection against [[cruel and unusual punishment]]).  The case cited an earlier extradition decision, ''[[Canada v. Schmidt]]'' (1987), which states extradition may be unconstitutional under section 7 if it "[[shocks the conscience]]."  In ''Kindler'', the Court noted that while [[Canada]] itself had abolished the death penalty, Canada should respect that most other countries had not.  This included the [[United States]], with which Canada shared cultural connections and an easily  crossed border.  Thus, extradition with the possibility of execution should not shock the conscience.

Kindler was ultimately returned to the United States.  On December 8, 2009, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Beard v. Kindler]]'' that Kindler's flight from the United States constituted an abandonment of his right to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;''Beard v. Kindler'', United States Supreme Court No. 08-992 (available at [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-992.pdf]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indian Wireless Telegraphs (Amateur Service) Rules, 1978]] lists five licence categories:&lt;ref name="wpc"&gt;Annexure V {{cite web|url=http://www.arsi.info/images/wpc78full.pdf|title=The Indian Wireless Telegraphs (Amateur Radio) Rules, 1978|year=1979|work=Ministry of Communications, Government of India|publisher=Controller of Publications, Civil Lines, New Delhi|pages=34|accessdate=2008-08-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010160640/http://www.arsi.info/images/wpc78full.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To obtain a licence, candidates must pass the [[Amateur Station Operator's Certificate]] examination conducted by the WPC.&lt;ref name="wpc-ax2"&gt;Appendix II {{cite web|url=http://www.arsi.info/images/wpc78full.pdf|title=The Indian Wireless Telegraphs (Amateur Radio) Rules, 1978|year=1979|work=Ministry of Communications, Government of India|publisher=Controller of Publications, Civil Lines, New Delhi|pages=34|accessdate=2008-08-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010160640/http://www.arsi.info/images/wpc78full.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The examination consists of two 50-mark written sections: Radio theory and practice, Regulations; and a practical test consisting of a demonstration of [[Morse code]] proficiency in sending and receiving.&lt;ref name="wpc-ax1"&gt;Annexure III, Appendix I, Section 2.3 {{cite web|url=http://www.arsi.info/images/wpc78full.pdf|title=The Indian Wireless Telegraphs (Amateur Radio) Rules, 1978|year=1979|work=Ministry of Communications, Government of India|publisher=Controller of Publications, Civil Lines, New Delhi|pages=34|accessdate=2008-08-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010160640/http://www.arsi.info/images/wpc78full.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After passing the examination, the candidate must clear a police interview. After clearance, the WPC grants the licence along with the user-chosen call sign. This procedure can take up to one year.&lt;ref name="cutabove"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-05-21/india/27883754_1_ham-radio-licence-operators|title=Ham operators are a cut above the rest|date=2007-05-21|work=[[Times of India]]|publisher=[[Times Group]]|accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This licence is valid for up to five years.&lt;ref name="wpc-sec12"&gt;Section 12 {{cite web|url=http://www.arsi.info/images/wpc78full.pdf|title=The Indian Wireless Telegraphs (Amateur Radio) Rules, 1978|year=1979|work=Ministry of Communications, Government of India|publisher=Controller of Publications, Civil Lines, New Delhi|pages=34|accessdate=2008-08-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010160640/http://www.arsi.info/images/wpc78full.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each licence category has certain privileges allotted to it, including the allotment of frequencies, output power, and the [[Types of radio emissions|emission modes]]. This article list the various frequencies allotted to various classes, and the corresponding emission modes and input [[direct current|DC]] power.

==Allotted spectrum==
The following table lists the frequencies that amateur radio operators in India can operate on.

*  Band refers to the [[ITU Radio Bands|International Telecommunication Union (ITU) radio band]] designation

==Emission designations==
{{main|Types of radio emissions}}

The [[International Telecommunication Union]] uses an internationally agreed system for classifying [[radio frequency]] signals. Each Type of radio emission is classified according to its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], method of [[modulation]], nature of the modulating signal, and Type of information transmitted on the carrier signal. It is based on characteristics of the '''signal''', not on the transmitter used.

An emission designation is of the form '''BBBB 123 45''', where '''BBBB''' is the bandwidth of the signal, '''1''' is a letter indicating the Type of modulation used, '''2''' is a digit representing the Type of modulating signal, '''3''' is a letter corresponding to the Type of information transmitted, '''4''' is a letter indicating the practical details of the transmitted information, and '''5''' is a letter that represents the method of [[multiplexing]].  The '''4''' and '''5''' fields are optional. For example, an emission designation would appear read as '''500H A3E''', where 500H translates to 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, and A3E is the emission mode as permitted.

The WPC has authorized the following emission modes:&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite book

==Licence categories==
{{further|Amateur radio licence categories in India}}
Two categories of amateur radio licence exist.

===Restricted Grade===
The Amateur Wireless Telegraph Station Licence, Restricted licence requires the same scores as the old term Grade II.The minimum age is 12 years.&lt;ref name="wpc-sec5"&gt;Section 5 {{cite web|url=http://www.arsi.info/images/wpc78full.pdf|title=The Indian Wireless Telegraphs (Amateur Radio) Rules, 1978|year=1979|work=Ministry of Communications, Government of India|publisher=Controller of Publications, Civil Lines, New Delhi|pages=34|accessdate=2008-08-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010160640/http://www.arsi.info/images/wpc78full.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licence allows the user to make [[radiotelegraphy]] (Morse code) and radiotelephony transmission in 12 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 100&amp;nbsp;W.

A Restricted Grade licence holder was previously authorized the use of radio telephony emission on frequency bands below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz on submission of proof that 100 contacts have been made with other amateur operators using [[continuous wave|CW]] (Morse code).&lt;ref name="wpc" /&gt; This has now since changed with restricted license holders being allowed phone (SSB) bands with the only restriction being the PEP(peak envelope power) limited to 50&amp;nbsp;W. Now Morse Code is not necessary for this exam

==Grounds for prosecution==
[[Kemalist]] and / or nationalist journalists were arrested on charges referring to the '''[[Ergenekon (organization)|Ergenekon]]''' case and several left-wing and Kurdish journalists were arrested on charges of engaging in propaganda for the '''[[PKK]]''' listed as a terrorist organization. The legal framework on '''organised crime''' and '''terrorism''' is imprecise and contains definitions which are open to abuse, leading to numerous indictments and convictions. Moreover, its interpretation by prosecutors and courts is uneven and is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights or the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, according to the European Commission. No clear distinction is made between incitement to violence and the expression of nonviolent ideas. The application of Articles 6 and 7 of the '''Anti-Terror Law''' in combination with Articles 220 and 314 of the '''Turkish Criminal Code''' leads to abuses; in short, writing an article or making a speech can still lead to a court case and a long prison sentence for membership or leadership of a terrorist organisation. Together with possible pressure on the press by state officials and the threat of possible firing of critical journalists, this situation can lead to a widespread self-censorship. Frequent website bans are a cause for serious concern and there is a need to revise the law on the internet.&lt;ref name="Turkey Progress Report 2012"&gt;The European Commission [http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/key_documents/2012/package/tr_rapport_2012_en.pdf Turkey Progress Report 2012]. Retrieved on 11 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Most journalists are in prison based on the following laws:
* The Anti-Terror Law of Turkey (also known as Terörle Mücadele Yasası, TMY), Articles 5 and 7 relating to articles of the Criminal Code on terrorist offences and organizations or assisting members of or making propaganda in connection with such organizations, as well as the lengthening of sentences;
* The Criminal Code of Turkey (also known as Türk Ceza Kanunu, TCK), Article 314 on establishing, commanding or becoming member of an armed organization with the aim of committing certain offences.&lt;ref name="Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe"&gt;{{cite news |title=Main findings of the table of imprisoned journalists in Turkey|author=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|url=http://www.osce.org/fom/89371|publisher=The Office of the Representative on Freedom of the Media|date=April 2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 3 types of journalists targeted ==
According to a report published by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Turkish authorities are engaging in widespread criminal prosecution and jailing of journalists, and are applying other forms of severe pressure to promote self-censorship in the press. The CPJ has found highly repressive laws, particularly in the penal code and anti-terror law; a criminal procedure code that greatly favors the state; and a harsh anti-press tone set at the highest levels of government. Turkey’s press freedom situation has reached a crisis point.&lt;ref name="Turkey's Press Freedom Crisis"&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists [http://cpj.org/reports/2012/10/turkeys-press-freedom-crisis.php Turkey's Press Freedom Crisis]. Retrieved on October 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This reports mentions 3 types of journalists targeted:

* investigative and critical reporters: victims of the anti-state prosecutions : The government’s broad inquiry into the Ergenekon plot ensnared '''investigative reporters'''. But the evidence, rather than revealing conspirators, points to a government intent on punishing critical reporters.
* Kurdish journalists: Turkish authorities conflate support for the Kurdish cause with terrorism itself. When it comes to Kurdish journalists, newsgathering activities such as fielding tips, covering protests, and conducting interviews are evidence of a crime. 
* collateral damages of the general assault on the press: The authorities are waging one of the world’s biggest anti-press campaigns in recent history. Dozens of writers and editors are in prison, nearly all on terrorism or other anti-state charges.&lt;ref name="Turkey's Press Freedom Crisis"/&gt;

==Concerns==
Concerns persisted over the rights of the defence, lengthy pre-trial detention and excessively long and catch-all indictments, leading to significantly enhanced public scrutiny of the legitimacy of these trials.&lt;ref name="Turkey Progress Report 2012"/&gt;

A report issued by the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media&lt;ref name="Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe"/&gt; describes a number of concerns concerning the case of arrested journalists in Turkey:
* Courts often impose exceptionally long imprisonment sentences. The longest conviction is 166 years and the longest jail sentence sought for a journalist is 3,000 years. 
* Many journalists face double life sentences if convicted, some without possibility for parole. Courts do not tend to grant pre-trial release of defendants. 
* There is concern that arrests and long pre-trial detentions without conviction are used as a form of intimidation. 
* Pre-trial detentions remain very long. In some cases journalists held in prison for up to three years are still awaiting trial. Some journalists have been imprisoned for more than five years while their trial is ongoing. 
* Journalists often face several trials and are often convicted for several offences. There is one journalist who faces 150 court cases.
* Media outlets reporting about sensitive issues (including terrorism or anti-government activities) are often regarded by the authorities as the publishing organs of illegal organizations. Courts often consider reporting about such issues as equal to supporting them.
* Journalists are often imprisoned in F-tipi cezaevi (F-type high security prisons), where they have to serve their time with the most dangerous criminals. It is also not uncommon to punish journalists with solitary confinement for extended time periods.

'''Monarchism''' is a movement that supports the [[monarchy]] as a form of [[government]].

{{Monarchism |expanded=all}}

==Ancient kingdoms and royal dynasties==

A monarch is the person at the head of a monarchy. This is a form of [[government]] in which a [[Sovereign state]] or country is ruled or controlled by an individual who typically inherits the throne by birth and rules for life or until abdication. Monarchs may be autocrats (absolute monarchy) or ceremonial heads of state who exercise the power, with actual authority vested in a [[parliament]] or other body (constitutional monarchy).

Monarchism is a system based on the belief that political power should be concentrated in one person who rules by [[decree]]. A monarchist is an individual who supports this form of government, independent from the person, the monarch.

{{homicide}}

'''Patricide''' is (i) the act of killing one's father, or (ii) a person who kills his or her father. The word ''patricide'' derives from the [[Latin]] word ''pater'' (father) and the Latin suffix ''-cida'' (cutter or killer). Patricide is a sub-form of [[parricide]], which is defined as an act of killing a close relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/patricide|title=Definition of PATRICIDE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patricides in myths and religions==
Patricide is a common archetype that is prevalent throughout many religions and cultures, and particularly in the mythology and religion of Greek culture. Some key examples of patricide from various cultures are included as follows:
* [[Apsu]], in the Babylonian creation epic the ''[[Enûma Elish]]'', was killed by his son Ea in the struggle for supremacy among the gods.
*In the mythology of the neighboring Mesopotamian [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] people the storm god [[Teshub]] kills his father [[Kumarbi]], sometimes jointly with his grandfather [[Anu]] in reciprocity for an attempted patricide by Kumarbi.
*In the Greek creation epic, first recorded in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', [[Cronus]] was jealous of his father [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]' power as ruler of the universe. Cronus thus killed or castrated his father. Cronus, in turn, was overthrown by his own son, [[Zeus]].
* [[Oedipus]] was [[destiny|fated]] to kill his father, a king, and marry his mother. His parents attempted to prevent this by leaving him on the side of a mountain as an infant. He was found and raised by a shepherd. Once grown, Oedipus meets his father while his father is travelling, but not knowing who he is, ends up killing him. He then unknowingly marries his mother to become king, ultimately fulfilling the prophecy.
* [[Pelias]] was killed by his daughters, who were deceived by [[Medea]] into thinking he could be resurrected.
* In the Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]], [[Babruvahana]] killed his father [[Arjuna|Arjun]], but Arjun was brought back to life by his wife, the snake goddess [[Uloopi]].
* In Chinese belief, people who commit patricide (or [[matricide]]) will be killed by a [[lightning]] strike as a punishment from filial and warrior deity [[Erlang Shen]].
* In [[Norse mythology]], [[Fafnir]] murdered his father [[Hreidmar]] to gain the cursed golden ring of [[Andvari]] that he had obtained. Some versions say that his brother [[Regin]] helped him.

The '''Mixed Courts of Egypt''' ({{lang-ar|المحاكم المختلطة}}, [[Romanization of Arabic|transliterated]]: ''Al-Maḥākim al-Mukhṭaliṭah'') ({{lang-fr|Tribunaux Mixtes d'Egypte}}) were founded in October 1875 by the [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha]]. Designed by [[Nubar Pasha|Nubar Nubarian Pasha]] (January 1825, İzmir, Ottoman Empire – January 14, 1899, Paris) to be part of the Khedive's great plans for Egypt, the Mixed Courts led to a radical reform of Egypt's chaotic nineteenth century legal system, where [[Consular court]]s competed with Government tribunals and religious courts for jurisdiction.  The completion of the [[Suez Canal]] (1869) and the development of the cotton trade had attracted many foreign interests and foreign nationals to Egypt.

The Mixed Courts had Codes, based on a civil law format inspired by the [[French Civil Code]] and British [[common law]] but with significant Islamic and local principles. Without suppressing the [[Consular court]]s which would have been diplomatically impossible the Mixed Courts were intended to streamline legal issues between foreign nationals, and between foreigners and Egyptians. Three courts were established in [[Cairo]], [[Mansoura, Egypt|Mansoura]] and in [[Alexandria]]; the proceedings were held in French.  Judges were appointed by the Khedive from leading Egyptian and foreign candidates. "The judiciary was at all times under the authority of the rulers of Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;S.W Hoyle, Mark (1991) "Mixed Courts of Egypt", (Arab and Islamic Law Series)&lt;/ref&gt; There were three districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=parPhilippe CHEVRANT-BRETON |url=http://theses.enc.sorbonne.fr/2000/chevrantbreton |title=L’abolition des capitulations et la suppression des tribunaux mixtes en Egypte (1937) |publisher=Theses.enc.sorbonne.fr |date=2013-07-22 |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the courts, hearing disputes between Egyptians and foreigners and between foreigners of different nationalities, was so successful that new, so-called Native courts were set up in 1883, after the [[History of Egypt under the British|British Occupation of 1882]]. The 1883 Codes were based on those of 1875, and the judges, mostly Egyptian, tended to follow the Mixed Courts’ interpretation of the law.

The Mixed Courts, by being the foremost judicial authority between 1875 and 1949 (when their functions were transferred to new National Courts) sat in times of political and social change in Egypt. Their decisions reflect the human and commercial history of the area, and involved complicated issues of law. The problems of sovereign immunity, sequestration of enemy property, international banking and maritime commerce were shadowed by the recognition and enforcement of divorces, legitimacy, and marriage contracts affecting people of different religions and nationalities. In between were a whole range of the usual types of legal disputes, such as trademarks and patents, and industrial injuries, without any developed theories at all that could be drawn upon for inspiration, either from inside or outside the country.

==Contribution==
What, if anything, did the Mixed Courts contribute to the present Egyptian codes? "The laws that were administered by the courts were now divided into 5 codes: (1) the Civil Code, (2) the Commercial Code, (3) the Maritime Code, (4) the Code of Procedure as regards the foregoing Codes, (5) the Penal Code."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grisby|first=W.E.|title=The Mixed Courts of Egypt|jstor=60235574}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The greatest change in 1949 was the Civil Code. The Maritime and the Commerce Codes were the old ones retained from 1883, and the Penal Code had been gradually updated.

The Criminal Codes differed from the other codes because it was only administered by the Mixed Courts to a slight extent; "because foreign governments were not willing to abandon their Civil Jurisdiction of their Consuls, therefore they were unwilling to give up the Criminal Code. This resulted in a compromise and what led to the Mixed Courts having very limited Jurisdiction in Criminal Matters. It only extended to simple police cases (contraventions), and to (1) offenses committed directly against the judges and officers of the Courts while in the exercise of their functions, as force or violence or bribery; (2) offense committed directly against the execution of the judgements of the Courts; (3) crimes imputed to judges and officers of the Courts, when they have committed them in the exercise of their functions, or in abusing their functions. The greater number of cases were still heard by the [[Consular court|Consular Courts]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grisby|first=W.E.|title=The Mixed Courts of Egypt|jstor=60235574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well before the closure of the Mixed Courts [[Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri]] Pasha was appointed as chairman of the Committee set up to draft a new Civil Code. He was assisted by many Egyptian jurists, and also by E Lambert, the French jurist. The result of this work was the 1949 Egyptian civil code, of 1149 Articles. The background to this eclectic and monumental work has already been described by Sanhouri himself. The 1949 Code was based on a mixture of the previous Mixed and Native codes, together with Egyptian jurisprudence, the Shari’a and various foreign codes from nearly 20 countries. The code was specifically drafted with the Shari’a in mind so that non-Islamic provisions were not consistent with it.&lt;ref&gt;S.W Hoyle, Mark (1991) "Mixed Courts of Egypt", (Arab and Islamic Law Series)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shari'a law==
Thus it may be seen that the custom of the country was upheld as a source of law, and natural law and equity, a major basis of Mixed Court jurisprudence, were both expressly included. In recent years, however, the overriding factor has been Islamic law, and this is now enshrined in the 1971 Constitution, as amended. The Shari’a is the principal source of legislation, and thus it follows that a more “Islamic” interpretation of the law will be in evidence. The Mixed Courts interpreted their codes in an Egyptian manner; the difference now is that an Islamic view, rather than simply an Egyptian one, will be taken, even though it can be argued{{By whom|date=April 2011}} that as the quality and confidence of the Egyptian judiciary grew in the years to 1949 the type of natural law and equity which was applied in the Mixed Courts was likely to be a blend of Muslim and Christian principles that eventually became more Muslim than Christian. The judges were not simply technicians, but interpreted rules, customs, and laws to give justice in Egypt. The 1949 code confirmed or re-established the Islamic viewpoint, and can be seen as influenced by the Mixed Courts jurisprudence only indirectly.

The Mixed Courts were established in 1875 to reform a chaotic situation. Their immediate effect was to make the Capitulatory Regime in Egypt less intolerable, because their establishment cured many ills, and stopped the fraudulent pursuit of claims by foreigners against the Egyptian government and other public Egyptian organisations.

A step forward in the unity of jurisdiction was the establishment of the Native courts in 1883, using codes based on the Mixed Codes. The Native courts and the Mixed Courts were national Egyptian courts. On their merger they became the National Courts.

Thus, giving justice in the name of Egypt, the Mixed Courts were Egyptian courts, and entitled to be regarded as such. Their codes were Egyptian codes and, together with the precedent that arose, were applied as Egyptian law to be used in the forum set aside for “mixed” disputes. There was a continuous creation, evolution, and progress in the law so that judgments were by no means restricted to simple interpretation of the relevant codes. Judgments were oriented towards the litigant. The question was, could the law help the parties and not, could the parties fit in with the written codes or existing law? People were no longer afraid of litigation, and the foremost principle of the rule of law, that no one, not even the ruler, was above the law was radical change for Egypt in the 1870s.

Foreign influence, and diplomatic and political claims against the Egyptian government, gave unscrupulous foreigners rights quite inconsistent with natural justice and equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoyle|first=Mark S.W.|title=The Mixed Courts of Egypt: An Anniversary Assessment|journal=Arab Law Quarterly|date=November 1985|volume=1|issue=1|page=62|jstor=3381673}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the establishment of the Mixed Courts reduced foreign abuse of the Egyptian system. Egypt before 1875 was a battleground of powerful forces. Foreign power was often exercised at the expense of Egyptian sovereignty. All this changed after 1875, as order grew from disorder and legal confidence was established. The Mixed Courts imposed the rule of law and thus began the transition of Egypt from a feudal country into a modern and structured state, with a legal climate conducive to commercial and social progress.

One of the reasons the judgments of the Mixed Courts were respected and trusted was that they were not seen by Egyptians as foreign law. In a slow and gradual way the consensus of Egyptian opinion shifted from favor to abolition. The Mixed Courts still had enough familiar principles to retain the confidence of the foreign community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoyle|first=Mark S.W.|title=The Mixed Courts of Egypt: An Anniversary Assessment|journal=Arab Law Quarterly|date=November 1985|volume=1|issue=1|page=64|jstor=3381673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An efficient system of law and enforcement obviated any necessity for self-help. Egypt was a notoriously litigious country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoyle|first=Mark S.W.|title=The Mixed Courts of Egypt: An Anniversary Assessment|journal=Arab Law Quarterly|date=November 1985|volume=1|issue=1|page=64|jstor=3381673}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to the benefit of her inhabitants from 1875 that a proper channel of dispute settlement existed between foreigners, and between foreigners and natives.

Parties felt that disputes should be left to settlement by the courts. They became conscious of having certain loosely defined rights. The practice of free legal aid meant that no one was denied justice through an ability to pay. Further, enforcement litigants could see that redress was available and real.

The Mixed Courts had only lasted for 74 years, an insignificant period of time in comparison to Egyptian history,{{According to whom|date=April 2011}} but covering years of profound change in Egypt, and often initiating or facilitating such change. 1949 saw the penultimate step in providing Egypt with a unified and modernized system of law, definitely Egyptian but clearly Western influenced.

==Conclusion==
The years 1926 to 1937 were years of great change. As the period drew to a close the final chapter in the history of the Mixed Courts began. In the 1920s they had seemed set to endure forever, but by the 1930s rapid and radical political change had sounded a warning note. In many ways the Mixed Courts had themselves encouraged the critical analysis, close reasoning, and scholarly research that had led to an educated elite of lawyers in Egypt. Those trained in law were at the front of nationalism, and in a way the Mixed Courts encouraged the very freedom of thought, independence of action, and respect for a national and sovereign rule of law which fostered much of the moderate nationalist opinion. By 1937 the merger of the Mixed Courts was agreed, by 1949 it was taking place.

In essence, this was true culmination of the 1875 reforms. From the beginnings of the Mixed Courts in 1875, to the Native Courts in 1883, and the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt|Montreux Convention]] reforms in 1937, the various jurisdictions of the Egyptian legal system drew closer together, while at the same time foreign consular jurisdiction lessened. Finally, the whole of Egypt's legal system became unified in 1956. The Mixed Courts paved the way for this to happen by the gradual cycle of reform, development and reform. The fusion of the Mixed and Native Courts provided an up-to-date and solid system.

The Mixed Courts established the rule of law in Egypt, developed a truly Egyptian court system and were the base on which the post-war Egyptian legal system rests. Their direct influence has waned and receded, but without their existence and work between 1875 and 1949, and without their conscientious and dedicated development and operation, the Egyptian legal system after the Second World War and until the present day would be quite different.

The '''National Assembly for Wales (Official Languages) Act 2012''' (anaw 1) ({{lang-cy|Deddf Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru (Ieithoedd Swyddogol) 2012}}) was an Act of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] that was given [[royal assent]] on 12 November 2012. It is significant in that it is the first Act passed in Wales to become law in over 600 years.&lt;ref name=CaerphObsNov2012&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.caerphillyobserver.co.uk/news/744753/first-welsh-act-passes-into-law/ |title=First Welsh Act passes into law |date=13 November 2012 |newspaper=Caerphilly Observer |accessdate=14 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/12/welsh-national-assembly-bill-law |title=Welsh assembly passes its first bill |first=Steven |last=Morris |date=12 November 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=14 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ITV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2012-11-12/first-welsh-law-for-600-years/ |title=First Welsh law 'for 600 years' |first=Adrian |last=Masters |date=12 November 2012 |work=ITV Wales |accessdate=14 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act consists principally of amendments to the [[Government of Wales Act 2006]], and provides that the National Assembly for Wales shall have two official languages, English and Welsh; and that they shall be treated equally.

It was not the first bill passed by the National Assembly for Wales, which was the bill for the [[Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Act 2012]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-19875643 |title=Legality of first Welsh bill challenged at Supreme Court |first=Toby |last=Mason |work=BBC News Wales |date=9 October 2012 |accessdate=14 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was the first to receive royal assent and so become law. The bill was passed by the National Assembly for Wales on 3 October 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.caerphillyobserver.co.uk/news/707416/welsh-and-english-become-official-languages-of-assembly-as-ams-pass-historic-bill/ |title=Welsh and English become official languages of Assembly as AMs pass historic Bill |date=4 October 2012 |newspaper=Caerphilly Observer |accessdate=14 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but then underwent a statutory [[Act of the National Assembly for Wales#Period of intimation and royal assent|period of intimation]], so that lawyers could verify that it fell within the remit of the National Assembly for Wales. Royal assent was given when the [[Welsh Seal]] was affixed to the Letters Patent by First Minister [[Carwyn Jones]] on 12 November 2012;&lt;ref name=CaerphObsNov2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=ITV /&gt; it was [[gazetted]] on 16 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60329 |date=16 November 2012 |pages=22047–22048  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Items of [[primary legislation]] passed by the National Assembly for Wales between 2008 and 2011 are known as [[Measure of the National Assembly for Wales|Assembly Measures]]. The original system of [[Welsh law]] was abolished under Henry VIII.

In its broadest sense, '''no-fault insurance''' is any type of [[insurance]] contract under which [[insured]]s are [[indemnified]] for losses by their own [[insurance company]], regardless of fault in the incident generating losses. In this sense, it is no different from [[first-party coverage]]. However, the term "no-fault" is most commonly used in the context of state/provincial [[automobile insurance]] laws in the United States, Canada, and Australia, in which a [[policyholder]] (and his/her passengers) are not only reimbursed by the policyholder’s own insurance company without proof of fault, but also restricted in the right to seek recovery through the civil-justice system for losses caused by other parties.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Description==

No-fault systems generally exempt individuals from the usual liability for causing body injury if they do so in a car collision; when individuals purchase "liability" insurance under those regimes, the insurance covers bodily injury of the insured and the insured's passengers caused by a car collision, regardless of which party would be liable under ordinary common law tort rules.  No-fault insurance has the goal of lowering premium costs by avoiding expensive [[litigation]] over the causes of the collision, while providing quick payments for injuries or loss of property.  Further, no-fault systems often grant "set" or "fixed" compensation for certain injuries regardless of the unique aspects of the injury or the individual injured. Workers compensation funds typically are run as "no fault" systems with usually a fixed schedule for compensation for various injuries.

Proponents of no-fault insurance argue that automobile collisions are inevitable and that at-fault drivers are not necessarily higher risk and should not necessarily be punished; moreover, they note that the presence of [[liability insurance]] insulates reckless or negligent drivers from financial disincentives of litigation; also, uninsured motorists are often "judgment proof" (i.e., can't and won't end up paying for their liability anyway), so that in regions with high numbers of such uninsured motorists, no-fault systems may make more sense. Furthermore, traditional insurance is regressive because drivers of inexpensive cars are liable for damage to any car, no matter its value, even though they only add a small amount of liability to the pool with their less valuable cars. This issue is fixed under a no-fault regime.

Critics of no-fault argue that dangerous drivers not paying for the damage they cause encourages excessive risky behavior, with only raised premiums and a higher risk rating as the potential consequence, and no jury awards or legal settlements. Detractors of no-fault also point out that legitimate victims with subtle handicaps find it difficult to seek recovery under no-fault.&lt;!-- ?? --&gt; Another criticism is that some no-fault jurisdictions have among the highest automobile-insurance premiums in the country, but this may be more a matter of effect than cause (e.g., the financial savings from no-fault may simply make it more popular in areas with higher automobile-collision risk, or high insurance rates may cause more drivers to go uninsured, increasing the attraction of a no-fault system).

==Origins==

The number of traffic accidents causing fatalities and debilitating injuries had become by the mid-1960s the source of a litigation explosion that was "straining (and in some areas overwhelming) the judicial machinery."&lt;ref name=Maryott&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/abaj52&amp;start_page=639&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=641|last=Marryott|first=Franklin J.|title=The Tort System and Automobile Claims: Evaluating the Keeton-O'Connell Proposal|work=American Bar Association Journal|volume=52|number=7|date=July 1966|pages=639–43, 639|accessdate=September 13, 2016|via=[[HeinOnline]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much legal thinking in academia was devoted to the question of whether the tort system should be replaced with another method of allocating risks of loss from accidents.&lt;ref&gt;''See'', ''e.g.'', {{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?public=false&amp;handle=hein.journals/ylr70&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=509|last=Calabresi|first=Guido|title=Some Thoughts on Risk Distribution and the Law of Torts|work=Yale Law Journal|volume =70|number=4|pages=499-53|date=March 1961|accessdate=September 13, 2016|via=[[HeinOnline]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical analyses were published showing the financial impact of automobile accidents.&lt;ref&gt;''See'', ''e.g.'', {{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?public=false&amp;handle=hein.journals/pnlr110&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=937|last1=Morris|first1=Clarence|last2=Paul|first2=James C.

Keeton]] of Harvard Law School and [[Jeffrey O'Connell]], then of the University of Illinois, in a law review article published in the Harvard Law Review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/hlr78&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=358|last1=Keeton|first1=Robert E.|last2=O'Connell|first2=Jeffrey|title=Basic Protection—A Proposal for Improving Automobile Claims Systems|work=Harvard Law Journal|volume=78|number=2|date=December 1964|pages=329–84|accessdate=September 13, 2016|via=[[HeinOnline]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consisted of two chapters of the book that they would publish the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keeton|first1=Robert E.|last2=O'Connell|first2=Jeffrey|title=Basic Protection for the Traffic Victim: A Blueprint for Reforming Automobile Insurance|location=Boston|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1965|lccn=65028434}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Keeton-O'Connell plan provided that all automobile owners would be required to purchase a new form of insurance, called "basic protection coverage," under which a victim has recourse for his net economic loss against the insurer of his own car, his host's car or, if the victim is a pedestrian, any car involved. Fault is not required to be shown except for of damages in excess of $10,000 for bodily injury, the deductible of $100 for bodily injury and property damage. Recoverable loss under this type of policy does not include pain and suffering and is reduced by damages recovered form other sources. The proposal generated immense discussion in legal and insurance publications with some concluding it was too "revolutionary."&lt;ref name=Maryott/&gt;

In 1967 Massachusetts state representative [[Michael Dukakis]], a 1960 graduate of Harvard Law School, introduced a modified version of the Keeton-O'Connell plan in the Massachusetts legislature.  The scheme was adopted in 1970.&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/hlrec52&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=152|last=Ward|first=Greg|title=No Fault Auto Insurance Faces Constitutionality Test Today|work=Harvard Law Record|pages=8–9, 15|volume=52|number=10|date=May 6, 1971|accessdate=September 13, 2016|via=[[HeinOnline]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law was challenged in court for claimed violations of numerous state and federal constitutional provisions.  The scheme was defended by the state attorney general and also Harvard Law School professors [[Archibald Cox]] and [[Philip Heymann]] in an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts overruled the objections in a unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/massachusetts/supreme-court/1971/360-mass-1-2.html Pinnick v. Cleary], 360 Mass. 1, 271 N.E.2d 592 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision opened the way for widespread adoption of no-fault automobile insurance schemes, a development that was encouraged by the federal [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref name=Ward/&gt;

==Overview in United States==
Most [[United States|U.S.]] states have a "traditional [[tort]]" liability system for auto insurance in which recovery is governed by principles of provable negligence. However, twelve U.S. states and the [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]] territory of [[Puerto Rico]] require policyholders to operate under a "no-fault" scheme in which individuals injured in automobile collisions are limited in their ability to seek recovery from other drivers or [[vehicle]] owners involved in a collision&lt;ref name=MSNMoney&gt;[http://money.msn.com/auto-insurance/is-no-fault-insurance-finished Is no-fault insurance finished?]. MSN Money.&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional 8 states have an "add-on" system in which the insureds retain the right to sue.&lt;ref name=MSNMoney/&gt;  In 2012, [[RAND Corporation]] published a study which found that costs were higher in no-fault systems.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson et al. (2012). [http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9505/index1.html What Happened to No-Fault Automobile Insurance?]. RAND Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of economic (medical and wage-loss) damages, most no-fault systems permit injured parties to seek recovery only for damages that are not covered by available first-party insurance benefits. In the case of non-economic (pain-and-suffering) damages, most no-fault systems permit injured parties to seek compensation only in cases of exceptionally "serious" injury, which can be defined in either of two ways:

* A quantitative '''monetary''' threshold that sets a specific dollar (or other currency) amount that must be spent on medical bills before a tort is allowed.  Disadvantages of this threshold are: (1) that it can encourage insureds (and their medical providers) to exaggerate medical costs through over-utilization, and (2) that, unless indexed, it can become ineffective over time because of inflationary effects on medical costs.
* A qualitative '''verbal''' threshold that states what categories of injuries are considered sufficiently serious to permit a tort (e.g., death, or permanent disability or disfigurement). The advantage of the verbal threshold is that it removes any incentive to inflate damage amounts artificially to meet some preset monetary loss figure. The primary disadvantage is that broad interpretation by the courts of the threshold can lead to over-compensation.

In three U.S. states – [[Kentucky]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]] – policyholders are permitted to choose between traditional tort and no-fault recovery regimes. Under such systems, known as “choice” or “optional” no-fault, policyholders must select between “full tort” and “limited tort” (no-fault) options at the time the policy is written or renewed; once the policy terms are set forth an insured may not change his/her mind without rewriting the policy.  In both Kentucky and New Jersey, policyholders who do not make an affirmative choice in favor of either full tort or limited tort are assigned the no-fault option by default; whereas in Pennsylvania, the full-tort option is the default.

Several U.S. states have experimented with and repealed their no-fault laws.  Twenty-four states originally enacted no-fault laws in some form between 1970 and 1975. [[Colorado]] repealed its no-fault system in 2003. [[Florida]]'s no-fault system [[Sunset provision|sunset]] on October 1, 2007, but the Florida legislature passed a new no-fault law which took effect January 1, 2008.

In terms of damages to vehicles and their contents, those claims are still based on fault. No-fault systems focus solely on issues of compensation for bodily injury. But it also works the other way: policies pay the medical bills for drivers and their companions independent of who was at-fault for the collision.

'''Paul Leon Stein''', AM, QC, (born 1939), is a former Australian lawyer and judge, and an authority on [[environmental law]].

==Early years and education==
Stein was born in London, England, on 4 January 1939. His parents were Hyman (Harry) Stein (1910–1980) and Sarah (Sadie) Stein née Henry (1908–1996); they had four children. Hyman Stein was a jazz musician who performed under the name Bing Stern. Stein has said, "We were not a poor family but my father's occupation as a musician did not allow for extras or luxuries."&lt;ref name="farewell"&gt;[http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/pages/SCO_speech_stein_110403 Transcript, ''Farewell Ceremony for the Honourable Justice Paul Stein upon the Occasion of his Retirement as a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales'', Supreme Court of New South Wales, 11 April 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416101949/http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/pages/SCO_speech_stein_110403 |date=16 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The family is said to have flipped a coin as a way to decide whether to emigrate to Australia or Canada, and Australia won the toss.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; Stein's elder brother and sister emigrated first, settling in Sydney. Stein, with the rest of his family, followed in 1953, on the [[Assisted Passage Migration Scheme]].

Before moving to Australia in 1953, Stein’s only experience of Andipodeans was an Australian schoolteacher who caned him for alleged cheating.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; Believing himself to be innocent, Stein has said of the experience, "I was not guilty but this plain injustice may have been the trigger for my rebellious streak."&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; In Sydney, Stein attended [[Sydney Boys High School]]. There, Stein reinstated the school’s football ([[soccer]]) team, which played for several years without formal recognition from the Sydney Boys High headmaster (either Gordon Barr or Kenneth John Andrews).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydneyboyshigh.com/archives/media-collection/?g2_itemId=825 Sydney Boys High School, ''Headmasters'', Sydney]&lt;/ref&gt; In protest at this lack of official recognition, Stein wrote letters to the Editor of the ''Sydney Morning Herald'', and refused to wear his high school uniform blazer.

Stein attended the [[Sydney Law School]], at [[The University of Sydney]] from 1957 to 1960. In his Articles of Clerkship, Stein’s master solicitor was Phillip Goldman, and later, John Pitman Webster of Uther Webster.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; During university Stein worked as a tram conductor in Sydney's eastern suburbs.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt;

==Career==

===Barrister &amp; Queens Counsel===

Stein was admitted to the bar in 1961.&lt;ref name="watchdog"&gt;'Barrister to be watchdog on the bureaucrats', ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 28 March 1977, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1964 Stein commenced at Mena House Chambers. He was part of the establishment of Forbes Chambers, Frederick Jordan Chambers, and Wardell Chambers.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; Stein took silk in 1981, and was a [[Queen's Counsel]] for two years before being appointed a judge of the [[District Court of New South Wales]].

At age thirty-eight, Stein was appointed Deputy Ombudsman of New South Wales, a position he held from 1977 to 1979.&lt;ref name="watchdog"/&gt; Stein was President of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board from 1979 to 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Goldie, 'Wran’s new man to fight discrimination', ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 26 June 1979, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein held numerous board and committee appointments, with particular involvement in social justice, civil liberties, and consumer advocacy issues. He was Chair of the Australian Consumers’ Association (now known as [[Choice (Australian consumer organisation)]] from 1974 to 1986, and Acting Chair of the Juvenile Leave Review Committee between 1985 and 1988. Stein was President of the Intellectually Handicapped Persons Review Tribunal from 1983 to 1989, and Chair of the Council of the Community Justice Centres of New South Wales between 1987 and 1993.

Stein was Chair of the Commission of Inquiry into the ACT Leasehold System in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.anu.edu.au/mac/Newsletters_and_Journals/ANU_Reporter/_pdf/vol_28_no_03/comment.html Julie P. Smith, 'Selling off the farm: will the ACT find cause for regret?,' ''ANU Reporter'', vol. 28, no. 3, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Board of the [[State Records Authority of New South Wales]] from 2001 to 2003. In 2012 Stein was Chair of the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority, and Chair of the Board of Governors of the New South Wales Law and Justice Foundation.&lt;ref name="Manly"&gt;[http://www.manly.nsw.gov.au/planning-and-development/miap-manly-independent-assessment-panel Manly Independent Assessment Panel, Manly Municipal Council, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently Chair of the NSW Environment Protection Authority (2012), and Chair of the Board of Governors of the NSW Law and Justice Foundation (2012).

==Contribution to environmental and planning law==

Among the contributions Stein has made to the law in his judicial career, one of the most significant is the development of the jurisprudence on [[ecologically sustainable development]]. It was the period at the Land and Environment Court where Stein made his most influential decisions, including ''State Pollution Control Commission v Caltex Refining Company Pty Ltd (1991)'', ''Corkhill v Hope (1991)'', and ''Corkhill v Forestry Commission of New South Wales (No 2) (1991)''.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; About the latter case, Justice [[James Spigelman]] said, "This was the first occasion in Australia that wildlife protection law was enforced against a government authority. It laid the foundation for future statutory regimes, both in this State and at the Commonwealth level."&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; In the seminal environmental law case ''Leatch v National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service (1993)'', Stein considered [[Precautionary Principle]]; this was the first time the principle had been applied in [[Common law]].&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt; Stein’s ability to write judgments swiftly and efficiently earned him the nickname 'Speedy' from fellow judges.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt;

On 10 December 2009 the Law Council of Australia held the symposium, "The future of environmental law: A symposium to mark the contribution of Paul Stein in the field of environmental and planning law".&lt;ref name="future"&gt;[http://epla.org.au/events/past-events/media/events/The%20Future%20of%20Environmental%20Law.pdf Law Council of Australia symposium, The future of environmental law: A symposium to mark the contribution of Paul Stein in the field of environmental and planning law, Sydney, 10 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The event included papers by Justice [[Peter McClellan]] QC, Justice [[Brian Preston]] SC, Professor Tim Bonyhady, and Emeritus Professor Ben Boer.&lt;ref name="future"/&gt;

==Contribution to legal and judicial education==

Stein has worked as a lecturer and author in the fields of local government and environmental law, and in judicial education. He was a Distinguished Visitor at Macquarie University's Centre for International and Environmental Law (MU-CIEL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mq.edu.au/research/centres_and_groups/muciel/collaboration "Collaboration" page, Centre for International and Environmental Law (MU-CIEL), Macquarie University, Sydney] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506023056/http://mq.edu.au/research/centres_and_groups/muciel/collaboration/ |date=6 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein is a patron of the ''Macquarie Journal of International and Comparative Environmental Law''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.mq.edu.au/research/law_journals/macquarie_journal_of_international_and_comparative_environmental_law Macquarie Journal of International and Comparative Environmental Law, Macquarie Law School, Sydney]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein was part of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]’s (UNEP) Global Judges Symposium on Sustainable Development and the Role of Law, 2002. This resulted in the creation of a ''Judicial Portal'', designed and developed by Stein, in co-operation with the World Conservation Union (IUCN).&lt;ref name="designed"&gt;[http://weavingaweb.org/pdfdocuments/Judicial%20PortalFactSheet.pdf Judicial Portal Fact Sheet, ‘Designed for judges with judges’, UNEP Global Judges Symposium, with the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]], Johannesburg, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The Judicial Portal was the world’s first Internet-based judicial communication network.&lt;ref name="designed"/&gt;

==Controversy and progressive politics==

As President of the Anti-Discrimination Board, in 1980 Stein raised objections to cartoons by [[Eric Jolliffe]], which depicted Aboriginal people.&lt;ref&gt;'The Jolliffe controversy: A storm in a bra-cup?' ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 21 August 1980, p. 2; Nancy Berryman, 'Cartoonist gets told to toe the colour line', ''Sun Herald'', 17 August 1980, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Stein argued that Jolliffe’s cartoons may cause offence because they represented Aboriginal people as intellectually inferior racial stereotypes. Also in 1980, Stein argued for the 1977 Anti-Discrimination Act to be amended to recognise discrimination on the basis of political belief, expression, and activity.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel Lukas, 'Politics and the worker, Change sought in law on discrimination', ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 4 August 1980, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A year earlier Stein rallied for discrimination law to include considerations of discrimination on the basis of disability.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Eckersley, 'Help for handicapped', ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 November 1979, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 the [[Anti-Discrimination Act 1977]] was amended to recognise persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;John Slee, 'Disabled win new job rights', ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 23 April 1981, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1981, Stein raised concerns about the discrimination of Indo-Chinese immigrants and refugees in Australia, calling for community education and leadership from government.&lt;ref name="Molloy_3"&gt;Susan Molloy and Richard Macey, 'Government urged to act to ease racial tensions', ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 February 1981, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 Stein called for an end to discrimination against Aboriginal people by police officers and judges, citing recent studies of arrests and incarceration.&lt;ref name="Molloy_3"/&gt; One controversial recommendation by the Anti-Discrimination Board, under Stein’s leadership, was the call for the [[age of consent]] for sexual activity to be lowered to fourteen.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Laurence, 'Report calls for age of consent to be lowered to 14', ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 26 January 1981, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein obtained some notoriety for making progressive statements about brothel laws in New South Wales. In 1989, as a judge of the [[Land and Environment Court of New South Wales]], Stein reportedly said that the New South Wales laws regarding prostitutes and brothels were "unsatisfactory and confusing", and the Land and Environment Court was not the forum in which to make moral judgments about prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Ray McCann, 'Judge regrets brothel laws', ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 13 September 1989, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9544">The '''Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensation for Personal Injury''', better known as the '''Pearson commission''' was a [[United Kingdom]] [[royal commission]], established in 1973 under the chairmanship of [[Colin Pearson, Baron Pearson|Lord Pearson]]. The '''commission''' reported in 1978 and made radical recommendations for [[tort reform]], Pearson believing that [[tort]]'s traditional role of compensation had become outdated with the rise of the [[welfare state]] since the end of [[World War II]]. He saw the [[Insurance|benefits]] system as having the primary role of providing compensation and security following an accident, and [[litigation]] as being secondary. As a result, the commission recommended a [[no-fault insurance]] scheme for [[road traffic accident|road traffic]] and industrial accidents, similar to the subsequent [[New Zealand]] [[Accident Compensation Corporation]], and a scheme of [[strict liability]] for [[consumer protection]]. However, the government's response was cool and the recommendations were not followed up, much to Pearson's disappointment.&lt;ref name="berlins"&gt;Berlins (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terms of reference ==
The '''commission's''' [[terms of reference]] were:&lt;ref name="berlins"/&gt;

==Recommendations==
'''Recovery of damages in tort''' - no profound changes were recommended but deduction from [[damages]] for social security benefits received was recommended and this was subsequently implemented. There was a further recommendation for the introduction of [[structured settlement]]s but this was not implemented until 1 April 2005 and without the [[inflation]]-proofing that the '''commission''' had recommended.&lt;ref&gt;[[Damages Act 1996]], s.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dow, D.  |author2=Lill, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Personal Injury and Clinical Negligence Litigation | location=London | publisher=CLP | year=2007 | isbn=1-905391-28-5 | pages=''pp''281–282 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Work injuries''' - a no-fault insurance scheme administered by the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] (DHSS), financed by employers and providing benefits at the level of the [[State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme]]. The scheme was also proposed to extend to the [[self-employed]] and injuries incurred during [[commuting]].

'''Road injuries''' - a no-fault insurance scheme administered by the DHSS, financed by a [[Tax|levy]] on [[petrol]], estimated at 1p per [[gallon]] (0.8p per [[litre]] at 2003 prices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Consumer Price Inflation since 1750 | author=O‘Donoghue, J.| journal=Economic Trends | volume=604 | year=2004 | pages=38–46, March | url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/article.asp?ID=726 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Air transport''', '''Sea and inland waterways''' - the '''commission''' noted that this was largely constrained by [[international convention]]s such as the [[Warsaw Convention]] but regretted the low level of settlements allowed.

'''Rail transport''' - a no-fault scheme was rejected in favour of proposed strict liability for accidents arising from movement of [[rolling stock]].

'''Products liability''' - a no-fault scheme was rejected and the strict liability scheme drafted by the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Commission of the European Union]] favoured. These European initiatives ultimately led to [[European Community]] [[Directive 85/374/EEC]] and the [[Consumer Protection Act 1987]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Giliker, P.  |author2=Beckwith, S.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Tort | publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell | location=London | isbn=0-421-85980-6 | pages='''9–014''' - '''9–038''' | edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Services in general''' - retention of existing remedies for the tort of [[negligence]].

'''Medical injuries''' - a no-fault scheme was not recommended but the '''commission''' held that the New Zealand and [[Sweden]] experience should be studied and reviewed. Strict liability for injury to human volunteers in [[clinical trial]]s was recommended. No such strict liability was introduced and subsequent volunteers often faced complex litigation as following the disastrous [[TGN1412]] trial in 2006.

'''Children''' - The '''commission''' proposed a general benefit for severely disabled children, no matter how their disability was caused, to be financed from general [[tax]]ation.

'''Vaccine damage''' - The '''commission''' proposed that this would be compensated by the general benefit for severely disabled children. Where [[vaccination]] took place on the recommendation of the government, strict liability was proposed.

'''Ante-natal injury''' - The '''commission''' proposed that this would be compensated by the general benefit for severely disabled children and by strict liability such as it applied to [[pharmaceuticals]]. The provisions of the [[Congenital Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act 1976]] should be restricted as it affected family members.

'''Occupiers' libaility''' - no change to law on [[occupiers' liability]] save the introduction of the Law Commissions recommendations on liability to [[trespass]]ers which ultimately led to the [[Occupiers' Liability Act 1984]].

'''Criminal injuries''' - activities of [[Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority]] endorsed and to be reviewed in the light of proposals for civil liability.

'''Animals''' - no change save for aligning [[Scottish law]] with that of [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

'''Exceptional risks''' - strict liability on "controllers of things or operations that by their unusually hazardous nature require supervision because of their potential for causing death or personal injury."

==Reception==
The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government expressed some caution over the recommendations, especially those as to no-fault compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=The Times | date=17 March 1978 | page=1, col.E | title=Government caution on injuries plan | author=Berlins, M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and insurance industry were hostile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=The Times | date=17 March 1978 | page=16, col.C | title=Civil liability and compensation proposals could be costly }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=The Times | date=18 March 1978 | page=1p, col.A | title=Insurance Counting the cost of Pearson | author=Allen, R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative Party came to power in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979]] and by 1983, the no-fault proposals, though not explicitly rejected, were falling into neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Pearson Commission: Recommendations, 29 November 1983 | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1983/nov/29/the-pearson-commission-recommendations | work=Hansard | date=29 November 1983 | accessdate=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Penguin Books Ltd. v. India Book Distributors and Others''''', was a decision of the [[Delhi High Court]] issued in 1984. [[Penguin Books|Penguin Books Ltd.]] of England brought a suit for perpetual [[injunction]] against the respondents, India Book Distributors of New Delhi, to restrain them from infringing Penguin's territorial license in 23 books, the subject matter of the suit.

==Facts==

A [[consent decree]] had been obtained in the [[United States]] stating that there shall be no restriction in regard to a book that is lawfully published for sale, import, export, distribution, or resale. Penguin Books Ltd. (PBL) holds territorial [[copyright]] license in some books under the [[Indian Copyright Act|Indian Copyright Act, 1957]]. The respondents, India Book Distributors, were distributing, importing or offering for sale thirteen of twenty three titles as American editions. A suit for personal injunction was brought against them restraining them from infringing on PBL's territorial license in the subject matter of the suit. The relief of [[temporary injunction]] was declined by a single judge on the ground of the US Court’s consent decree.

Clauses V and VI of the consent decree provide as follows:

:V. Each defendant is enjoined and restrained, directly or indirectly, from preventing or restricting any purchaser of a lawfully published book from importing or exporting such book to or from the United States or such purchaser from selling, distributing or providing for the resale of such Book to customers in United Slates interstate or foreign commerce."

:VI. "Nothing in this Final Judgment shall prevent any defendant, in and of itself, from acquiring, granting or otherwise transferring exclusive or non-exclusive copyright rights, or from exercising or authorizing the exercise of such rights under the copyright law of any country, including the United States, or from the assertion of such other statutory rights as such defendant may have, provided that no foreign copyright law or other foreign statutory right may be used by any defendant to exclude or restrict the importation or resale in the United States of a lawfully published Book.”

==Issues discussed==

1.	Contended that the consent decree is not a bar to asserting rights under the Copyright Act, 1956.
2.	It was contended by the plaintiff that the importation of American Editions for the purpose of resale is an infringement of copyright.
3.	Whether temporary injunction can be granted?

==The Court’s ruling==

Several contentions were raised.

'''1. Contended that the consent decree is not a bar to asserting rights under the Copyright Act, 1956.'''
It was prima facie evident that PBL had the license to the books in question. The Whitford Committee also observed that there is a practice of challenging the title is more often than not an abuse of process.
The court held that the consent decree has no extraterritorial application. The United States of America, being a foreign state, is an independent sovereign government which exercises sovereign authority over its own territory and in accordance with international law has no right to exercise sovereign authority beyond its own territory. The courts of India cannot recognize the writ of a District Court of the United States notwithstanding the principle of comity of nations. This is made abundantly clear from Clause VI which acts as a saving clause. The effect of the clause is that Clause V will not affect the statutory rights that belong to publishers under foreign regional arrangements.

It was also held by the Court that copyright law is territorial in nature and while US might disallow restrictions on the resale of books, the laws of US may not abrogate the effects of laws in the place where those books have been imported. Thus the importer will be forced to comply with the laws of the country to which he imports and he cannot defeat the rights of the exclusive license holder.

'''2. It was contended by the plaintiff that the importation of American Editions for the purpose of resale is an infringement of copyright.'''

'''Importation:'''

The court held that ‘Importation is forbidden unless a license has been given.’ The court said that the above idea needs to be respected as if it is not, then the purpose of granting exclusive licenses would be defeated, as would the idea of the national division of copyright which has been provided for in the International Copyright Convention.

The argument by the defendant was that importation of lawfully published books is not an infringement of copyright under the Act. The court was dismissed this argument by saying that the owner of copyright has been defined to include an exclusive license. Exclusive license in turn has been defined as a license having ‘any right comprised in the copyright’ in a work to the exclusion of all others including the owner of the copyright. The license may be limited in scope, time and territory.

Copyright has been defined to include the exclusive right, among others, to reproduce the work in any form and to publish the work. Furthermore, S. 51 of the Act deals with infringement. It says that copyright in a work will be infringed when an infringing copy of the work has been imported. Infringing copy of work has been defined as any work which has been imported in contravention to the provisions of the Act. The mainstay of S.51 is that a copyright is deemed to be infringed when any person does something which the Act confers as an exclusive right to the owner of the copyright.

The court holds in the judgment that the test of whether an imported work infringes copyright is laid down in S.53 (this section allows seizure of goods by the Registrar of Copyrights). The test is that whether the copy if made in India would infringe copyright? If so then it infringes upon copyright. This is because the essence of infringement is taking what is not yours. Copyright is a territorial right and has been regarded as something worth protecting in the ultimate public interest.

The court held that the import has infringed upon the copyright of PBL because if they are made here they would offend the copyright of PBL.

'''Publication'''

The court also held that the work has been published in India. To do this, the court said that for literary works publication is ‘the issue of copies of the work, either in whole or in part, to the public in a manner sufficient to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the public having regard to the nature of the work.’ 
The court held that the India Distributors is not guilty of primary infringement but is guilty of secondary infringement when it allows public distribution of titles.

'''3. Whether temporary injunction can be granted?'''

The last question is whether a temporary injunction can be granted. The court said that temporary injunctions are granted in cases where damages are an inadequate remedy. The test for this was laid down in American Cyanamid v. Ethicon. The following questions must be asked:
# Is there a serious issue to be tried ? If there is not no injunction will be issued. If yes, then  the next question is looked into by the court.
# Can the plaintiff be adequately be compensated with damages? If no, the court must see if the defendant can be adequately be compensated with the plaintiffs undertaking to pay at trial then an injunction shall be ordered.
# If there is no clear answer then the court shall look into who shall suffer greater inconvenience if the injunction is granted or not. This is called the balance of convenience test.
# If the balance of convenience test fails then the relative strength of each side’s case should be evaluated by looking at the affidavit evidence.

Injunctions in such cases will usually be granted, as most infringements constitute continuing offences and won’t be granted if the damage to the plaintiff would be out of proportion with the infringement.

==Significance==

This decision was useful in clarifying the law in India with regard to parallel importation. There was a change in law after the judgment where Section 14 of the Act was amended from "publication" to "issue of copies of the work to the public not being copies already in circulation."&lt;ref&gt;Copyright (Amendment Act), 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of this amendment which when read with S. 40, which says that all provisions of this will apply to works first published in any territory as if it was first published in India, would mean that all books published abroad would be akin to books published in India. So the same limitations should apply, including the doctrine of first sale. This has been the position taken by various commentators.&lt;ref name=exhaustion&gt;http://cis-india.org/a2k/publications/exhaustion.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Court, however, in the recent Eurokids&lt;ref&gt;MANU/MH/0938/2005&lt;/ref&gt; decision seemed not to have taken notice of the change in law and followed the reasoning given in the Penguin judgment.

The decision has also been criticized as it does not deal with the issue of [[privity of contract]] i.e. how are the terms of the license (namely the territorial limitation) being imposed on a third party who has no knowledge of the license and neither is a party to the license?&lt;ref name=exhaustion/&gt;

==Comparative analysis of other jurisdictions==

===United States===

The US believes in the doctrine of first sale which enables the resident of the US to resell legally obtained items without the copyright owners permission. In Kirstaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, The US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that the protections and exceptions offered under the copyright act are applicable anywhere and not copies made just in the US. So the first sale doctrine is applicable anywhere and parallel imports are allowed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/56491-a-textbook-case.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

Europe follows an idea of regional exhaustion where the first sale doctrine applies within the [[European Economic Area (EEA)]]. This is because the idea of free trade of goods is placed on a very high pedestal. However, for goods originating outside the EEA, the countries are free to enact law which stops parallel importation using copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aippi.org/download/commitees/240/WG240English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Poe v. Ullman''''', 367 U.S. 497 (1961),{{ref|citation}} was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case that held that [[plaintiff]]s lacked [[standing (law)|standing]] to challenge a [[Connecticut]] law that banned the use of [[contraceptives]] and banned [[physician|doctor]]s from advising their use because the law had never been enforced. Therefore, any challenge to the law was deemed [[ripeness (law)|unripe]] because there was no actual threat of injury to anyone who disobeyed the law. The same statute would later be challenged again (successfully) in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965).

==Harlan's dissent==
Justice Harlan dissented and, reaching the merits, took a broad view of the "liberty" protected by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] Due Process to include not merely state violations of one of the first eight amendments which had been held to be "incorporated" in the Fourteenth, but against any law which imposed on "liberty" unjustifiably. Harlan described the "liberty" protected by that clause as "a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints."

However, Justice Harlan specifically noted that laws regulating homosexuality, fornication, and adultery would be permitted under this analysis: 

{{quote|Yet the very inclusion of the category of morality among state concerns indicates that society is not limited in its objects only to the physical well-being of the community, [367 U.S. 497, 546] but has traditionally concerned itself with the moral soundness of its people as well. Indeed to attempt a line between public behavior and that which is purely consensual or solitary would be to withdraw from community concern a range of subjects with which every society in civilized times has found it necessary to deal. ''The laws regarding marriage which provide both when the sexual powers may be used and the legal and societal context in which children are born and brought up, as well as laws forbidding adultery, fornication and homosexual practices which express the negative of the proposition, confining sexuality to lawful marriage, form a pattern so deeply pressed into the substance of our social life that any Constitutional doctrine in this area must build upon that basis.'' Compare McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 . ''Adultery, homosexuality and the like are sexual intimacies which the State forbids altogether'', but the intimacy of husband and wife is necessarily an essential and accepted feature of the institution of marriage, an institution which the State not only must allow, but which always and in every age it has fostered and protected. ''It is one thing when the State exerts its power either to forbid extramarital sexuality altogether, or to say who may marry'', but it is quite another when, having acknowledged a marriage and the intimacies inherent in it, it undertakes to regulate by means of the criminal law the details of that intimacy.}}

==Impact==
Justice Harlan's general view has had enormous influence on the modern Supreme Court; Justice [[David Souter]] endorsed the general reasoning behind Justice Harlan's test in his concurrence in 1997's ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]].'' Souter wrote that Harlan's dissent used [[substantive due process]], and recent cases demonstrated the "legitimacy of the modern justification" for that approach.

{{Competition law}}
Though in general, each business may decide with whom they wish to deal, there are some situations when a '''refusal to deal''' may be considered an unlawful [[anti-competitive practice]], if it prevents or reduces [[competition]] in a [[Market (economics)|market]]. The unlawful behaviour may involve two or more companies refusing to use, buy from or otherwise deal with a person or business, such as a competitor, for the purpose inflicting some economic loss on the target or otherwise force them out of the market. A refusal to deal (also known as a group [[boycott]]) is forbidden in some countries which have restricted market economies, though the actual acts or situations which may constitute such unacceptable behaviour may vary significantly between jurisdictions. 

==Definitions==
Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission defines the refusal to deal as:

{{Quote|Agreements involving [[competitor]]s that involve restricting the supply of goods are prohibited if they have the purpose or effect of substantially lessening [[competition]] in a market in which the businesses operate.|Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission|Refusal to deal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Refusal to deal|date=1 January 2007|publisher=ACCC Publishing Unit|isbn=1-921227-28-1|url=http://www.accc.gov.au/publications/refusal-to-deal |author=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Indian Competition Act 2002 defines the refusal to deal as:
{{Quote|"Refusal to deal" includes any agreement which restricts, or is likely to restrict, by any method the persons or classes of persons to whom goods are sold or from whom goods are bought|The Competition Act|2002 (India) S4-d}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11749">''' Robert Hubert''' (c. 1640 – 27 October 1666) was a watchmaker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leasor|first=James|title=The plague and the fire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tgui1pU3ckQC&amp;pg=PA235|year=2001|publisher=House of Stratus|isbn=0-7551-0040-9|page=235|chapter=A Scapegoat is Hanged}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Rouen]], France, who was [[Wrongful execution|executed]] following his [[false confession]] of starting the [[Great Fire of London]].

==Great Fire of London==
{{main|Great Fire of London}}
Between 2 and 5 September 1666, a major fire broke out in [[Pudding Lane]] in the [[City of London]], and proceeded to destroy around 80 percent of the old city.

==Confession==
Hubert's confession, at first, was of starting a fire in [[Westminster]]. However, this story proved unsatisfactory, and his confession changed upon learning that the fire never reached Westminster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europeanhistory.about.com/od/ukandireland/a/agreatfirelon_4.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318195224/http://europeanhistory.about.com/od/ukandireland/a/agreatfirelon_4.htm |archive-date=2007-03-18 |publisher=About.com |title=The Great Fire of London 1666: Hunting For A Scapegoat |first=Robert |last=Wilde |quote=...at first he said he'd started it in Westminster, which the fire never even got near..." |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having learned that the fire started in [[Pudding Lane]], in the house of the baker Thomas Farriner (or Farynor), he then claimed to have thrown a crude fire grenade through the open window of the Farriner bakery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/09/01/the_odd_body_confessing_sam/ |title=What is a Confessing Sam? |work=[[The Register]] |date=1 September 2006 |access-date=3 September 2006 |first=Stephen |last=Juan |quote=Hubert confessed to having started the fire by throwing a crude fire grenade through an open bakery window.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He claimed to have acted with accomplices, who stopped the water cocks to sabotage the effort to put out the fire. Hubert's confessed motive was, apparently, that he was a French spy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldlondonmaps.com/viewspages/0157.html |title=The Great Fire of London, 1666 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705100148/http://www.oldlondonmaps.com/viewspages/0157.html |archive-date=2006-07-05 |quote=... he claimed to have had accomplices had stopped the water cocks for the water supply of London so that the fire could not be fought effectively (during the fire the reservoirs of water kept in the city for such an eventuality were strangely dry). Hubert (who claimed he was an agent for the French) ... |website=Old London Maps |publisher=Sara Douglass Enterprises |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an agent of the Pope.

==Trial and execution==
Hubert's confessions never seemed convincing. His retroactive change of story to fit the facts, though, was not the only reason. Hubert had not even been in London at the time that the fire broke out &amp;mdash; he had not even arrived in England until two days after the fire started.&lt;ref&gt;Juan (2006), ''The Register''.  "...Hubert, a sailor, had not arrived in England until two days after the fire started...".&lt;/ref&gt;  That he was not in the country at the time of the outbreak of fire is not in doubt, as testified, years later, by a captain of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] ship the ''Maid of Stockholm'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cercles.com/review/r1/hanson.html |title=Book Review: The Dreadful Judgement: The True Story of the Great Fire of London 1666 |first=Alain |last=Lauzanne |year=2001 |magazine=Cercles |issn=1292-8968 |quote=... a few years later the master of the Maid of Stockholm testified that the young man, who was bound for Rouen, was on board his ship when the fire broke out.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he personally had landed Hubert ashore two days after the outbreak of the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E3D81331F931A1575AC0A9649C8B63 |title=When London Started Over |first=Simon |last=Winchester |date=2002-09-22 |work=[[The New York Times]] |quote=Many years later a Swedish ship's captain testified that he had landed the watchmaker ashore two days after the fire had started.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having never seen the Farriner bakery, Hubert also did not know that it had no windows. What is more, he was judged so severely crippled that it would have been impossible for him to throw the claimed grenade.&lt;ref&gt;Juan (2006), ''The Register''. "[he] was never near the bakery where the fire started, and was so badly crippled that throwing anything was beyond him. If that were not enough, the bakery had no windows."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubert's confession is often attributed to a mental simplicity, an inability to understand what it was he was doing; a kind of "Confessing Sam" tendency. One source claims, though, that the confession was coerced "probably by an extreme form of torture".&lt;ref&gt;Winchester (2002), ''The New York Times''. "[he] was coerced into confessing (probably by an extreme form of torture) to having hurled a home-made chemical fireball into the bakery."&lt;/ref&gt;

As ''[[The London Gazette]]'' suggests, some put the disaster down to chance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] notwithstanding which suspicion, the manner of the burning all along in a Train, and so blowen forwards in all its way by strong Winds, make us conclude the whole was an effect of an unhappy chance, or to speak better, the heavy hand of God upon us for our sins [...]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''The London Gazette'', [[:File:London-gazette.gif|8 September 1666]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the many obvious flaws and impossibilities in Hubert's confession, a scapegoat was needed. Even the king, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was suspected of having instigated it, in order to punish the people of London for the execution of his [[Charles I of England|father]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Lauzanne (2001), ''Cercles''&lt;/ref&gt;  Nationalism was high with Britain embroiled in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], and many nationalities--the Dutch, French, Spanish, and Irish--were suspect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/learning/features_facts/tudor_stuart_london_2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427114020/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/learning/features_facts/tudor_stuart_london_2.html |archive-date=2006-04-27 |title=Investigate The Great Fire of London |publisher=[[Museum of London]] |access-date=2018-10-26 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frenchmen were particularly vulnerable, as illustrated by the murder of a Frenchman whose tennis balls were mistaken for 'balls of fire'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  Hubert, a foreigner and Frenchman, was a chief suspect, as suggested by the ''London Gazette'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Strangers, Dutch and French were, during the fire, apprehended, upon suspicion that they contributed mischievously to it, who are all imprisoned, and Informations prepared to make a severe inquisition [...]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Catholics were also chief suspects, and accusations were so formal as to be added to the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London|Monument]] in 1668, which stayed (with brief interruptions) until 1830:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the most dreadful Burning of this City; begun and carried on by the treachery and malice of the Popish faction.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, ''About.com''. "Catholics remained the favoured villain [...] the inscription remained until 1830."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hubert had convenient attributes. He was convicted and sentenced to death at the [[Old Bailey]].

Despite the contradictoriness of both Hubert's account and of public opinion, the Farriner family, in whose bakery the fire had started, was naturally under pressure &amp;mdash; they needed to show that their ovens had been doused properly&amp;mdash; and three members of the family were present in the jury.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, ''About.com''. "...the group judging him contained three members of the Farriner family. They vehemently denied any wrongdoing and claimed to have doused the ovens properly...".&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Farynor stated that, after midnight, he had:

&lt;blockquote&gt;gone through every room and found no fire, but in one chimney, where the room was paved with bricks, which fire I diligently raked up in embers [...] no window or door might let wind disturb them and that it was absolutely set on fire on purpose[...]&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Few of the jury at his trial actually believed Hubert guilty. One contemporary account claims that Hubert was "only accused upon his own confession; yet neither the judges nor any present at the trial did believe him guilty, but that he was a poor distracted wretch, weary of his life, and chose to part with it in this way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.trivia-library.com/c/time-and-history-100-am-the-great-london-fire.htm |chapter=Time and History 1:00 A.M.

"The Old Bailey jury, however, found that, "not having the fear of God before his eyes, but moved and led away by the instigation of the devil," Hubert had deliberately started the fire."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubert was hanged at [[Tyburn, London]], on 27 October 1666.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://col4.museumoflondon.org.uk/mediaLib/382/media-382948/original.pdf |title=Information on Robert Hubert |format=PDF |publisher=[[Museum of London]] |access-date=2018-10-26 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his body was being handed to the [[Company of Barber-Surgeons]] for dissection, it was torn apart by a crowd of Londoners.&lt;ref&gt;Lauzanne (2001), ''Cercles''.

[[Traffic law]] in [[China]] is still in its nascent stage {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} (see [[Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China]]). Therefore, the '''[[Traffic#Rules of the road|rules of the road]] in China''' are understood to mean both the codified and uncodified practices, procedures and norms of behavior generally followed by motorists, cyclists and [[pedestrian]]s in the [[mainland China|mainland]] of [[China]].

==Legal Background==
The first traffic regulations for China went into effect on August 6, 1955. 59 articles formed the ''City Traffic Regulations'' ({{zh|s=城市交通规则|t=城市交通規則}}), promulgated by the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China]]. It was vague and terse, however, and punishments for violators were relatively light.

In 1988 the regulations were revisited, but the result was still a traffic ''administrative regulation'' (中华人民共和国道路交通管理条例). There still was no ''law'' to control traffic.

The first [[expressways of China|expressway]] traffic regulations surfaced on March 26, 1990, under the title ''Interim Regulations for Expressways''. These were strengthened later on in the 1990s, when a new regulation (albeit temporary) took effect, banning "new drivers" (PRC licence holders for less than a year) from the expressways.

The [[Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China]] represented a huge breakthrough. It instituted higher fines, compulsory [[auto insurance|vehicle insurance]], and a point system for penalties, among other reforms. The bill was passed with [[Hu Jintao]] in power in late October 2003 and took effect on all of mainland China on May 1, 2004.

==Drive on the Right==
Except for a brief period during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976) when the government encouraged people to drive on the left (for symbolic/ideological reasons),{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} the convention has been to drive on the right. In practice, however, driving to the left into oncoming traffic is not uncommon in China, nor is it as [[social stigma|stigma]]tized and [[sentence (law)|penalized]] as it is in other countries. {{Citation needed|reason=A substantial statement is left uncited|date=November 2016}}This is especially true of [[bicycle|bicyclists]], electric bicycles, and motorcycles who&amp;mdash;unless physically prevented by barriers&amp;mdash;are almost equally likely to be found riding on the right, left or straight down the middle of lanes of traffic.

==Right-of-way==
[[Traffic#Right of way|Right-of-way]] ([[Simplified Chinese]]: 先行权, [[Pinyin]]: xiānxíngquán, ''Lit: “first go rights''”) is defined as such in all Chinese dictionaries, however, most Chinese drivers’ understanding of this concept is markedly different from those in societies with a strong tradition of the [[rule of law]]. Compared to the western understanding of right-of-way, which refers to the legal right to proceed forward in a vehicle without fear of being found at fault for causing a collision, right-of-way in China means, for all intents and purposes, that the person who is in the way (first) has the right. In practice, this translates into motorists and cyclists turning or merging straight into the path of other traffic believing that the onus is on the other person to avoid a [[collision]]. {{Citation needed|reason=There is nothing to back up any of this passage's content, to dispel its appearance as a satirical piece |date=November 2016}}

When the right-of-way is unclear (such as at unmarked intersections) it is common practice for drivers in many parts of the world to make eye contact with each other and use nods or hand gestures to either exert or defer right-of-way. The opposite applies in China, where people actively avoid eye contact, and in fact ''turn away'' from the person whose progress they are impeding so as to communicate their intention to proceed regardless. {{Citation needed|reason=There is nothing to support any of this passage's content, which includes quite substantial statements|date=November 2016}}

==Stop and go==
{{Cleanup rewrite |2=section|date= January 2013}}Given the relatively recent introduction of a law technically requiring motorists to stop at a red light, it is not surprising that drivers frequently disregard traffic lights and proceed on red.{{citation needed|date= January 2013}} The frequency of this occurrence varies according to time and place.{{citation needed |date=January 2013}} A crowded intersection at midday with police presence results in drivers diligently observing the law, while a desolate intersection at 1 A.M. is sure to witness cars and trucks speeding through red lights without pause.{{citation needed|date= January 2013}}

Pedestrians are especially in a difficult situation. In cities such as [[Beijing]], new "self-service" traffic lights provide pedestrians with easy access across the road—just push a button, wait, and go when the light changes. Unfortunately, unless these traffic lights come with supervising cameras connected to the police, some drivers are likely to pass through these as well, making the pedestrian buttons rather pointless.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Crossings with no camera of any kind are likely to have chaotic traffic, as neither police nor technology are present to enforce the law.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

A substantial change in the new [[Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China]] is a new requirement which forces drivers to stop at red lights even if there is a crossing only to the left (no crossing to the right), thereby outlawing straight-ahead at red lights that was permitted at an intersection with no crossing to the right. Drivers, however, still can turn right at red lights, unless signs prohibit this.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Finally, during the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]], some battalions of [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] would gather at traffic lights, forcing drivers to stop at the green light and go once it had turned red – supposedly because red was the colour of [[Communism]]{{citation needed |date=July 2015}}. Due to some traffic light systems being unmanned, drivers at these crossings would often{{vague |date=July 2015}} go at the green light – causing collisions where a neighboring lights system was hijacked and all the drivers were going at red.{{citation needed |date= January 2013}} Officially, the idea of "Red lights mean go" was never adopted by the regime.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=Qvo5sUPuaKEC&amp;pg=PA332&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedestrians and bicyclists==
A long-standing tenet has been for the larger vehicle involved in a collision to assume responsibility, e.g., if a car collides with a bicycle the car driver is at fault. If a bicycle and pedestrian collide it is the bicyclist's fault. Practically, this understanding emboldens pedestrians and cyclists to take liberties with cars and trucks, impeding their progress by moving into the flow of traffic under the assumption that larger vehicles will give way. This notwithstanding, the incidence of vehicle-pedestrian collisions is on the decline, despite the fact that the new [[Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China]] allows for only one case in which drivers are not at fault for hitting a pedestrian—that is, if the pedestrian purposely violates traffic laws.

Very few drivers will slow down when approaching a pedestrian crossing. Even fewer will actually stop for pedestrians waiting to pass by. When this happens, however, a quick wave back by the pedestrian, indicating gratitude, is not uncommon.

==Road rage in China==
[[Road rage (phenomenon)|Road rage]] is uncommon in China.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This is possibly due the fact that Chinese motorists have fewer expectations that other drivers will offer to "give way" and have a less legalistic/absolute view of traffic procedures. Road rage is not completely absent, however. A few cases have been witnessed in [[Beijing]]: they include assault with golf clubs, car chases and the like. Sometimes the [[police]] will intervene; those who commit extreme physical assault can often expect to be prosecuted criminally. In compliance with the [[Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese criminal code]], a case of road rage resulting in death will often see the offender receive the [[death penalty]]. A recent example was the [[Yao Jiaxin murder case]].

==Traffic collisions and conflict resolution==
Officially, all traffic collisions must be reported to the police. Exempt are cases where only minor damage was done to the vehicle, with nobody hurt, injured or killed. Cases of self-damage (e.g., driving into a tree) officially need to be reported to the police, but in reality, few people bother. This, however, indicates a waiver of responsibility for the [[insurance]] company.

When a collision occurs between two vehicles it is almost always resolved by the payment of money by one party to the other on the spot, with or without any admission of fault. After initial indignation or recalcitrance, one or both parties will demand financial compensation. It is supposed that either party considers the [[socio-economic status]] and occupation of the other, and the desirability of [[face (sociological concept)|saving face]]. Eventually one party will relent, and they will bargain down to an agreeable amount of compensation.

Another feature of a traffic collision in China is that in many cases, neither party will move their vehicle from the position that it came to rest following the collision, regardless of its effect on the flow of traffic. It is a justifiable fear of many Chinese motorists not to move their vehicle from the scene of a collision because recent traffic law changes have provided for hefty penalties in the event of a hit-and-run. A driver found guilty of hit-and-run forfeits his or her license for life, and any party to a collision who flees the scene is subject to severe sanctions.

Often in China, drivers whose cars hit a pedestrian, injuring them, often drive their cars over them several more times to kill them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2015/09/why_drivers_in_china_intentionally_kill_the_pedestrians_they_hit_china_s.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20151003111205/http://www.businessinsider.com/in-china-drivers-would-rather-kill-than-injure-2015-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military vehicles==
A vehicle with a government or military plate are not subject to the ''[[Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China]]'' (中华人民共和国道路交通安全法); they may run red lights, drive in the wrong direction or weave in and out of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Fauna, 1 December 2009, [http://www.chinasmack.com/2009/pictures/caught-fake-chinese-military-vehicle-license-plates.html Caught: Fake Chinese Military Vehicle License Plates], ChinaSMACK&lt;/ref&gt; Communist party officials and [[People's Liberation Army]] members are also exempt from paying road tolls and adhering to parking regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Wu Zhong, 21 November 2007, [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/IK21Ad01.html Drivers with a license to kill in China], Asia Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=skymilit&gt;12 April 2008, [http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/20080641312629?f=rss Bogus Military Vehicles And Plates Seized], Sky News&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Xinhua News Agency]], "police officers are also reluctant to pull over drivers of military vehicles even if the drivers are breaking the law",&lt;ref name=skymilit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2008-04-11, [http://english.cri.cn/2946/2008/04/11/1321@344676.htm Military Cracks Down on Fake License Plates], Xinhua&lt;/ref&gt; which is the reason behind an emerging trend where individuals purchase counterfeit military registration plates to avoid being pulled over by police. Xinhua reported in 2008 that since July 2006, over 4,000 fake military vehicles and 6,300 fake plates have been confiscated, and criminal gangs involving 5,000 people have been apprehended; under Chinese law, those caught driving under fake registration plates are fined up to 2,000 RMB, and counterfeiters can be jailed for up to three years.&lt;ref name=skymilit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;16 June 2009, [http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/6678980.html Chinese army, police seize thousands of fake military license plates, IDs], People's Daily&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Enforcement Act of 1871''', sometimes called the '''Civil Rights Act of 1871''' or the '''Second Ku Klux Klan Act''', was a [[United States federal law]].  The act was the second of three [[Enforcement Acts]] passed by the [[United States Congress]] from 1870 to 1871 during the [[Reconstruction Era]] to combat attacks on the [[Voting rights in the United States#African Americans and poor whites|suffrage rights]] of [[African Americans]] from groups like the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[John C. Churchill]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] introduced his bill H.R. 2634 in the [[41st United States Congress]].  The bill was passed by Congress in February 1871 and signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on February 28, 1871.

{{Politics of Singapore}}

'''Separation of powers in Singapore''' is founded on the concept of [[constitutionalism]], which is itself primarily based upon distrust of power and thus the desirability of [[limited government]]. To achieve this, the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]] of the [[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]] splits the power to govern the country between three branches of government&amp;nbsp;– the legislature, which makes laws; the [[Government of Singapore|executive]], which executes them; and the [[judicial system of Singapore|judiciary]], which enforces them. Each branch, while wielding legitimate power and being protected from external influences, is subjected to a system of [[separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] by the other branches to prevent abuse of power. This [[Westminster system|Westminster constitutional model]] was inherited from the British during Singapore's colonial years.

The Singapore system of government, as with those of a number of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions, exhibits a partial [[separation of powers]]. The [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]] is a parliamentary executive as the [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] and other ministers are drawn from the [[Parliament of Singapore#Members of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs). Hence, it is the Cabinet that drives Parliament's legislative agenda. In addition, the executive possesses some law-making power as it is authorised to issue [[sources of Singapore law#Subsidiary legislation|subsidiary legislation]], while the [[President of Singapore|President]] is a member of both the executive and the legislature.

The legislature exercises a check upon the executive by imposing a weak sanction through the doctrine of [[individual ministerial responsibility]]. Cabinet ministers may be called upon to justify their policies in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] by elected MPs ([[backbencher]]s belonging to the ruling party and opposition MPs), as well as non-elected Members ([[Non-constituency Member of Parliament|Non-constituency members of parliament]] (NCMPs) and [[Nominated Member of Parliament|Nominated members of parliament]] (NMPs)).

In line with the concept of constitutional supremacy, the judiciary has the role of safeguarding the Constitution, and acts as an institutional check through its inherent power to strike down unconstitutional laws, and to invalidate acts or decisions by the executive which are inconsistent with the Constitution or with [[administrative law in Singapore|administrative law rules]]. However, judicial power is not unfettered and is also restrained by constitutional and legislative prohibitions. The judiciary also defers to the executive where [[justiciability|non-justiciable]] matters are involved. [[Judicial independence in Singapore|Judicial independence]] allows the judiciary to check the exercise of power by the other branches of government more effectively, enhancing the idea of the separation of powers. Constitutional safeguards exist to secure the independence of [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] judges, but a point of contention is that [[State Courts of Singapore|State Courts]] judges do not enjoy security of tenure as they are members of the [[Singapore Legal Service]] and may be transferred out of the State Courts to other departments of the Service by the Legal Service Commission.

The separation of powers in Singapore is also enhanced by intra-branch checking mechanisms. Within the executive, the Elected President adds to the overall scheme of checks and balances through his [[powers of the President of Singapore|discretionary power]] to block certain government actions. However, the presence of an override mechanism wielded by Parliament blunts the office's powers. The [[Presidential Council for Minority Rights]] also serves as a check on the legislature by reviewing [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] to ensure that they do not discriminate against racial and religious minorities. However, the Council's powers are constrained by the presence of an override mechanism as well.

==Introduction==

===Constitutionalism===
[[File:Lord Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] (1834–1902) wrote: "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."]]

The idea of [[separation of powers]] is founded on the basis of [[constitutionalism]]. The notion of constitutionalism is primarily one of culture. Lawrence W. Beer proposed in ''Constitutional Systems in the Late Twentieth Century Asia'' (1992) that constitutionalism is where "national history, custom, religion, social values and assumptions about government meet positive law, economic force and power politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Lawrence W. Beer|title=Constitutional Systems in the Late Twentieth Century Asia|location=Seattle, Wash.; London|publisher=[[University of Washington Press]]|year=1992|page=2|isbn=978-0-295-97174-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the notion of constitutionalism differs from region to region and there can be no one specific notion of constitutionalism across the world. As [[Thio Li-ann]] puts it, "constitutionalism is itself a form of culture which is constructed, rather than 'organic'; a constitutional order is the 'most complex form of socio-political organisation'".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|chapter=The Province of Constitutional Law|title=A Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law|location=Singapore|publisher=[[Singapore Academy of Law|Academy Publishing]]|year=2012|pages=3–93 at 13–14|isbn=978-981-07-1516-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the constitutional culture differs from country to country, in general the "idea of modern constitutionalism rests upon the distrust of power".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Carl J[oachim] Friedrich|authorlink=Carl Joachim Friedrich|title=Limited Government: A Comparison|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|year=1974|pages=12–13|isbn=978-0-13-537159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is founded on the problem of power as espoused by [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]&amp;nbsp;– that "[p]ower tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely".&lt;ref name="Acton"&gt;{{citation|author=John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton, First Lord Acton|authorlink=John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|chapter=Appendix [Letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, 5 April 1887]|editor=John Neville Figgis|editor-link=Neville Figgis|editor2=Reginald Vere Laurence|title=Historical Essays and Studies|url=https://archive.org/details/a544621300actouoft|location=London|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan and Co., Limited]]|year=1907|pages=503–505 at 504|oclc=847945644}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is this distrust of power that has resulted in the need to ensure separation of powers. The ultimate aim of constitutionalism is to establish the idea of [[limited government]]. In countries that subscribe to constitutional supremacy, the constitution is the supreme law of the land and demarcates the extent of power that each branch of government (the executive, legislature and [[judiciary]]) is able to wield, as well as how each branch may act as a checking mechanism on the other branches. This aspect of constitutionalism is "concerned with curbing oppressive government and preserving individual freedom while retaining a realm for the exercise of legitimate governmental power".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Timothy J. O'Neill|title=Liberal Constitutionalism &amp; Bureaucratic Discretion|journal=Polity|date=Spring 1988|volume=20|issue=3|pages=371–393 at 371|jstor=3234868}}, cited in Thio, "The Province of Constitutional Law", p.&amp;nbsp;38, para.&amp;nbsp;01.103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation of powers===
The state needs laws in order for it to function, and this results in the creation of three distinct powers: one to create laws (the legislature), one to execute the laws (executive), and one to ensure that the rules are being followed (judiciary). Each branch of government has its own set of functions and hence the power that is available for each branch to wield is different as well. Even though this power to govern the society has already been divided into the three branches, the idea of constitutionalism implies "a commitment towards regularised legal restraints on power in the form of inter- and intra-institutional checks and balances and legal procedure".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|chapter=The Constitutional Framework of Powers|editor=Kevin Y[ew] L[ee] Tan|title=The Singapore Legal System|edition=2nd|location=Singapore|publisher=[[National University of Singapore|Singapore University Press]]|year=1999|pages=67–122 at 72|isbn=978-9971-69-213-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply put, there must be a separation of powers, where each branch is able to wield its own power to perform its functions independent of undue influence but yet be restrained from an abuse of its power through checking mechanisms. A system of checks and balances serves to ensure that each power will not be subject to abuse by the controlling body. While the checking mechanisms exercised by each body should be sufficient to prevent abuse of power, they should also not overstep their boundaries and encroach upon the powers that the other branches wield lawfully. In ''[[Federalist No. 51|The Federalist No. 51]]'' (6 February 1788), [[James Madison]] wrote that "[a]mbition must be made to counteract ambition",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author="Publius" (James Madison)|authorlink=James Madison|chapter=On Maintaining a Just Partition of Power among the Necessary Departments|url=https://archive.org/details/federalist00hami|title=The Federalist: A Collection of Essays Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison Interpreting the Constitution of the United States as Agreed upon by the Federal Convention, September 17, 1787|edition=rev.|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=Colonial Press|year=1901|pages=284–288 at 285|oclc=317653138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while in ''[[Federalist No. 48|The Federalist No. 48]]'' (1 February 1788) he explained the need for a system of checks and balances in preserving the separation of powers doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;"Publius" (Madison), "Constitutional Connection of the Departments of Government", ''The Federalist'', pp.&amp;nbsp;271–276 at 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;unless these departments be so far connected and blended as to give to each a constitutional control over the others, the degree of separation which the maxim requires, as essential to a free government, can never in practice be duly maintained.}}

====Reasons for separation of powers====
[[File:AduC 001 Montesquieu (1689-1755).JPG|thumb|upright|An engraving of [[Montesquieu]] (1689–1755) by [[Émile Bayard]], published in ''Album du centenaire'' (1889). Montesquieu wrote in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748) that arbitrariness and tyranny would result if executive, legislative and judicial powers were united in the same person.]]

One of the most notable proponents of the conception of separation of powers was [[Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748). In that work, he observed:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Baron de Montesquieu (Charles de Secondat)|authorlink=Montesquieu|others=Thomas Nugent, transl.|chapter=Book XI: Of the Laws which Establish Political Liberty with Regard to the Constitution|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/spiritlaws01montgoog|title=[[The Spirit of the Laws|The Spirit of Laws]]|edition=rev.|volume=1|location=New York, N.Y.|publisher=Colonial Press|year=1899|pages=149–182 at 151–152|oclc=1355299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
{{quote|When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or in the same body of magistrates, there can be no liberty; because apprehensions may arise, lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws, to execute them in a tyrannical manner.

Again, there is no liberty, if the judiciary power be not separated form the legislature and executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression.}}

The separation of powers brings its merits in just governance. However, where each branch wields more power than it legitimately should, there is room for abuse, leaving the rest of the society open to the potential of being ruled by tyranny of the majority. Hence it is important that a system of checks and balances is in place to ensure that power will not be abused to the detriment of the people.&lt;ref name="Thio 160"&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|chapter=Constitutional Principles|title=A Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law|location=Singapore|publisher=Academy Publishing|year=2012|pages=155–222 at 160|isbn=978-981-07-1516-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Separation of powers also promotes the efficiency and competence in allocating powers by "[fitting] form to function by matching tasks to the most suitable body". Specialization of the functions and roles of the various branches helps to promote efficiency as each branch of government has specific tasks and goals that it can work towards. After all, one of the main aims of this measure is to ensure that society's goals are met, and this can be done through an efficient system of government. Lastly, separation of powers helps to enhance democratic responsibility. With the various branches of government being responsible for specific functions, people are more inclined to vote into Parliament (which will form part of the legislature) persons who will best represent their views.&lt;ref name="Thio 160"/&gt;

====Pure and partial separation of powers====
There are two main notions of separation of powers&amp;nbsp;– pure separation of powers and partial separation of powers. Pure separation of powers was a concept formulated by M. J. C. Vile in ''Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers'' (1967) as a constitutional arrangement where there are no overlaps at all between the branches of government. In fact, "the persons who compose these three agencies of government must be kept separate and distinct, no individual being allowed to be at the same time a member of more than one branch. In this way each of the branches will be a check to the others and no single group of people will be able to control the machinery of the State".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=M. J. C. Vile|title=Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers|location=London|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1967|page=13|isbn=978-0-19-827160-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, this is hard to achieve and largely remains a theoretical notion. One of the few states that can be considered close to achieving this state of separation of powers would be the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Constitutional Principles", p.&amp;nbsp;159, para.&amp;nbsp;03.015.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, legal systems that follow the [[Westminster system|Westminster model]] adopt a partial separation of powers. This occurs when there are overlaps across the three branches. In Singapore, the legislature and executive overlap because ministers in the [[Cabinet of Singapore|Cabinet]] are appointed from the [[Parliament of Singapore#Members of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs). Thus, the same group of people are able to exercise both the power to make law and to execute the law.&lt;ref name="Art 25(1)"&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|ed=1985|rep=1999}}, Art. 25(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the separation of powers in Singapore==
The origins of the separation of powers in Singapore lie in the Westminster constitutional model inherited from the United Kingdom during its colonial past, first as part of the [[Straits Settlements]], and then as an independent nation. When Singapore was transferred to the [[Colonial Office]] in 1867, it was given a normal colonial constitution. This constitution vested legislative authority over the colony in the [[Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements]]. The constitution also retained the structure of the judicial system already established by the Second Charter of Justice, which had vested judicial power in the Court of Judicature of the Straits Settlements. In 1877, an [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] was introduced into the government of the Straits Settlements, with the role of advising the [[List of British Governors of the Straits Settlements|Governor]] on all affairs of importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Kevin Tan Yew Lee|title=The Evolution of Singapore's Modern Constitution: Developments from 1945 to the Present Day|url=http://www.sal.org.sg/digitallibrary/Lists/SAL%20Journal/Attachments/2/1989-1-SAcLJ-001-Tan.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119163808/http://www.sal.org.sg/digitallibrary/Lists/SAL%20Journal/Attachments/2/1989-1-SAcLJ-001-Tan.pdf|archivedate=19 January 2014|journal=Singapore Academy of Law Journal|year=1989|volume=1|pages=1–28 at 1–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1877 onwards, this broad structure specifying the powers of the three organs of state remained largely intact. The constitution remained unchanged until the end of the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese Occupation]], when the Straits Settlements were disbanded. Although constitutional amendments were then made, the overarching hierarchy of executive, legislative and judicial bodies which had been operating before the war was retained. This basic arrangement also survived Singapore's [[Singapore in Malaysia|merger]] and [[history of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|separation]] from [[Malaysia]], and consequent independence.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, "The Evolution of Singapore's Modern Constitution", pp.&amp;nbsp;6 and 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Singapore Constitution thus vests legislative, executive and judicial power in the legislature, executive and judiciary respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Arts. 23, 38 and 93.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a defining feature of Westminster-style constitutions, of which Singapore's constitution is one.&lt;ref name="Mohammad Faizal"&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu v. Public Prosecutor|court=SGHC|year=2013|num=163|parallelcite=[2012] 4 S.L.R. [''Singapore Law Reports''] 947 at 956–957, paras. 11–12|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is implicit from the fact that the organs of state have separate roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Hinds v. The Queen|court=UKPC|year=1977|num=22|parallelcite=[1977] A.C. 195|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The separation of powers doctrine in Singapore is not absolute but qualified; it is not pure but partial.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|chapter=The Constitutional Framework of Powers|editor=Kevin Y[ew] L[ee] Tan|title=The Singapore Legal System|edition=2nd|location=Singapore|publisher=[[National University of Singapore|Singapore University Press]]|year=1999|pages=67–122 at 77|isbn=978-9971-69-212-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The partial separation of powers doctrine in Singapore is exemplified in the following ways:

[[File:Walter Bagehot NPG cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1891 [[mezzotint]] of [[Walter Bagehot]] (1826–1877). Bagehot described the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]] as a "committee of the legislative body selected to be the executive body".]]

*'''Members of the executive drawn from the Parliament'''. First, Singapore has a parliamentary executive. While the legislature exercises legislative power and the executive exercises executive power, these two institutions are not separate or independent. This feature was described by [[Walter Bagehot]] as "the efficient secret of the English Constitution", which was defined as "the close union, the nearly complete fusion of the executive and legislative powers". This fusion is facilitated by the existence of the Cabinet, as a "committee of the legislative body selected to be the executive body".&lt;ref name="Bagehot"&gt;{{citation|author=Walter Bagehot|chapter=The Cabinet|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/englishconstitu05bagegoog|title=[[The English Constitution]]|location=London|publisher=[[Chapman &amp; Hall|Chapman and Hall]]|year=1867|pages=1–36 at 12|oclc=60724184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministers in Cabinet are appointed from the MPs;&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 25(1).&lt;/ref&gt; they thus exercise the power both to make and execute the law.
*'''Executive issues subsidiary legislation'''. Second, the executive has power to issue [[sources of Singapore law#Subsidiary legislation|subsidiary legislation]] and assent to treaties. This is contrary to the [[nondelegation doctrine|non-delegation doctrine]], by which one branch of government must not authorise another entity to exercise the power or function which it is constitutionally authorised to exercise itself.&lt;ref name="Thio 83"&gt;Thio, "The Constitutional Framework of Powers", p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; In Singapore, subsidiary legislation, though made by the executive, has "legislative, as opposed to administrative effect". The contravention of the non-delegation doctrine is deemed necessary because time constraints make it impossible for Parliament to enact all laws. In subsidiary legislation, the broad, general terms in [[primary legislation]] are explained and elaborated upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|chapter=The Legislature and the Electoral System|title=A Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law|location=Singapore|publisher=Academy Publishing|year=2012|pages=285–359 at 314|isbn=978-981-07-1516-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''President a member of both the executive and legislature'''. Third, the [[President of Singapore|President]] is vested with both executive authority and legislative power.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Arts. 23 and 38.&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the legislature, in general the President must assent to all laws passed by the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 58(1): "[T]he power of the Legislature to make laws shall be exercised by Bills passed by Parliament and assented to by the President."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the President has limited [[powers of the President of Singapore|discretionary executive powers]] to withhold assent to certain [[bill (proposed law)|bills]], including attempts by the [[Government of Singapore|Government]] to draw down financial reserves accumulated by past governments, to change the investment ability of the [[Central Provident Fund Board]], and to alter the President's own discretionary powers.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 21(2)(c). See generally {{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|chapter=The Executive, the Prime Minister and Cabinet Government|title=A Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law|location=Singapore|publisher=Academy Publishing|year=2012|pages=369–381|isbn=978-981-07-1516-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English influence on Singapore's governmental system is visibly strong, though Singapore's system fundamentally differs from that of the United Kingdom as it is [[unicameralism|unicameral]]. Singapore's take on the separation of powers is greatly informed by its unique values and legal culture. The traditional separation of powers doctrine in the United Kingdom is based on a fundamental distrust of human nature, and by extension, an even greater distrust of power, which "tends to corrupt".&lt;ref name="Acton"/&gt; As a result, it is necessary for each branch of government to be checked and managed, to prevent its otherwise absolute and uncurtailed power being abused. Singapore, on the other hand, has based its system of government on the election of trustworthy and honourable leaders, instead of on the implementation of a system specifically to prevent dishonourable ones misusing their power. In other words, aside from legal methods of controlling government&amp;nbsp;– that is, through institutionalised checks and balances&amp;nbsp;– non-legal methods are used as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|chapter=The Theory and Practice of Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Singapore: Trends and Perspectives|url=https://nus.academia.edu/LiannThio/Papers/971945/The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Judicial_Review_of_Administrative_Action_in_Singapore_Trends_and_Perspectives|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/649A00vfF?url=http://nus.academia.edu/LiannThio/Papers/971945/The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Judicial_Review_of_Administrative_Action_in_Singapore_Trends_and_Perspectives|archivedate=23 December 2011|editor=Yeo Tiong Min|editor2=Hans Tjio|editor3=Tang Hang Wu|title=SAL Conference 2011: Developments in Singapore Law between 2006 and 2010: Trends and Perspectives|location=Singapore|publisher=Academy Publishing|year=2011|pages=714–752 at 725|isbn=978-981-08-8670-7|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "internally from Parliament and the Executive itself in upholding high standards of public administration and policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Chan Sek Keong|authorlink=Chan Sek Keong|title=Judicial Review – From Angst to Empathy: A Lecture to Singapore Management University Second Year Law Students|url=http://www.sal.org.sg/digitallibrary/Lists/SAL%20Journal/Attachments/516/%282010%29%2022%20SAcLJ%20469-489_Chan%20CJ.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63bXAGCt7?url=http://www.sal.org.sg/digitallibrary/Lists/SAL%20Journal/Attachments/516/%282010%29%2022%20SAcLJ%20469-489_Chan%20CJ.pdf|archivedate=1 December 2011|journal=Singapore Academy of Law Journal|date=September 2010|volume=22|pages=469–489 at 480, para. 29|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This attitude towards the control of public power reflects the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideals underlying the Government's stance that separation of powers is less important than choosing leaders that can be trusted and do not need to be fettered:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Shared Values [Cmd. 1 of 1991]|location=Singapore|publisher=Printed for the [[Government of Singapore]] by Singapore National Printers|year=1991|at=para. 41|oclc=42436009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The concept of government by honourable men (''junzi''), who have a duty to do right for the people, and who have the trust and respect of the population, fits us better than the Western idea that a government should be given as limited powers as possible, and should always be treated with suspicion unless proven otherwise.}}

==Inter-branch checks==
Since independence, Singapore's legal system has evolved increasingly towards its local context.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Gary F. Bell|chapter=The Singapore Legal System in Context – Whither the Concept of the National Legal System?|editor=Kevin Y[ew] L[ee] Tan|title=The Singapore Legal System|edition=2nd|location=Singapore|publisher=Singapore University Press|year=1999|pages=1–25 at 12|isbn=978-9971-69-213-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Developments in government and constitutionalism have brought about distinctive features in its system of checks and balances. A few issues arise due to the long-standing one-party dominance in Singapore's political system. Since the [[Singaporean general election, 1963|1963 general election]], the [[People's Action Party]] has repeatedly prevailed as the majority party in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Parliamentary Elections Results|url=http://www.eld.gov.sg/elections_past_parliamentary.html|archiveurl=http://perma.cc/8V6H-VUSC|archivedate=20 January 2014|publisher=[[Elections Department]]|date=8 October 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the recent [[Singapore general election, 2011|2011 general election]], it managed to capture 81 of 87 seats contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=2011 Parliamentary Election Results|url=http://www.eld.gov.sg/elections_results2011.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306071538/http://www.eld.gov.sg/elections_results2011.html|archivedate=6 March 2014|publisher=Elections Department|date=8 October 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative checks on the parliamentary executive===
As mentioned above, Singapore has a parliamentary executive in which Cabinet ministers are drawn from and accountable to Parliament. The existence of a parliamentary executive does not mean government by Parliament; it is a separate and distinct branch of power, suited to make policies and carry out executive decisions.&lt;ref name="Thio 83"/&gt;

However, because of the party system, the Cabinet is often composed of the leaders of the majority party in Parliament. As such, it asserts control over the legislative agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|chapter=The Executive, the Prime Minister and Cabinet Government|title=A Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law|location=Singapore|publisher=Academy Publishing|year=2012|pages=369–384 at 377|isbn=978-981-07-1516-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One associated problem is that of an "[[elective dictatorship]]"&amp;nbsp;– [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone]], once described it as the dominance of the executive over a subservient Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Lord Hailsham|authorlink=Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|title=Elective Dictatorship [The Richard Dimbleby lecture; 1976]|location=London|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|year=1976|isbn=978-0-563-17254-3}}, reviewed in {{citation|author=Basil Markesinis|authorlink=Basil Markesinis|title=Elective Dictatorship|url=http://pa.oxfordjournals.org/content/XXX/3/324.citation|journal=[[Parliamentary Affairs]]|year=1977|volume=XXX|issue=3|pages=324–327}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ministerial responsibility====
The doctrine of [[individual ministerial responsibility]] is a [[Constitution of Singapore#Constitutional conventions|constitutional convention]] adopted from the Westminster constitutional model. According to this doctrine, Parliament imposes a check on the Cabinet by scrutinising government bills and actions, and calling upon ministers to justify policies before the House in open debate. This ensures that the Cabinet is accountable not only to Parliament but also to the public, who have access to transcripts of Parliamentary debates.&lt;ref name="Thio 85"&gt;Thio, "The Constitutional Framework of Powers", p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with the party system, the Government also observes collective ministerial responsibility or [[Cabinet collective responsibility]]. This is enshrined in Article 24(2) of the Constitution, which states that "[s]ubject to the provisions of this Constitution, the Cabinet shall have the general direction and control of the Government and shall be collectively responsible to Parliament". According to Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] in 2002, "[t]he principle of collective responsibility means that there is an agreement between the Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues that they will stand together as a team when accounting for their actions before Parliament". This principle also seeks to enhance inter-ministry co-ordination by ensuring that all ministers share the same broad policy positions, and that there is no "unnecessary duplication or, worse, mutual contradiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Goh Chok Tong|mplink=Goh Chok Tong|office=[[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister]]|title=Debate on President's Address|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00068266-ZZ|date=5 April 2002|volume=74|column=544–545}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This check on the executive branch, however, is a weak one. Since Cabinet ministers are often the leaders of the majority party in Parliament, they may enforce [[party discipline]] and loyalty through the [[Parliament of Singapore#Party whip|party whip]] such that MPs from that party conform to the [[party line (politics)|party line]]. This means that a majority of Parliament will be less inclined, if at all, to oppose or challenge the executive's decisions.&lt;ref name="Thio 85"/&gt;

====Efficacy of opposition MPs, NCMPs and NMPs====

=====Opposition members of parliament=====
Given the one-party dominance in Singapore, the opposition MPs in Parliament play a crucial role in checking the executive. They enforce the doctrine of ministerial responsibility by providing constructive criticism of executive policies. They are also entitled to vote for or against bills and motions, but this may exercise little influence over majoritarian power. As such, the effectiveness of the opposition hinges on its ability to keep the executive, as well as the majority party, vigilant and accountable to society.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "The Constitutional Framework of Powers", pp.&amp;nbsp;86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Non-Constituency members of parliament=====
[[File:Sylvia Lim at a Workers' Party general election rally, Bedok Stadium, Singapore - 20110430-02.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sylvia Lim]] at a [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] rally at [[Bedok Stadium]] during the [[Singaporean general election, 2011|2011 general election]]. Before being elected as an MP for [[Aljunied Group Representation Constituency|Aljunied GRC]] in that year, Lim was an NCMP between 2006 and 2011.]]

[[Non-constituency Member of Parliament|Non-Constituency members of parliament]] (NCMPs) were introduced into Parliament for the purpose of ensuring "the representation in Parliament of a minimum number of Members from a political party or parties not forming the Government".&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 39(1)(b).&lt;/ref&gt; The number of NCMPs in Parliament is nine less the number of opposition MPs elected at a general election.&lt;ref&gt;The NCMP scheme is regulated by the {{Singapore legislation|title=Parliamentary Elections Act|cap=218|ed=2011}} ("PEA"), ss.&amp;nbsp;52(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Marking a departure from the Westminster model, the NCMP scheme was conceived to introduce alternative political voices in Parliament. According to Deputy Prime Minister [[Wong Kan Seng]], the presence of a parliamentary minority would help younger MPs gain experience in debate, ensure transparency of Parliamentary proceedings and "dispel any suspicions of cover-ups", as well as give the opposition a forum to put forth their agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Wong Kan Seng|mplink=Wong Kan Seng|office=[[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]]|reading=Second|bill=Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment)|billurl=http://www.parliament.gov.sg/sites/default/files/100003.pdf|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00004346-WA|date=26 April 2010|volume=87|column=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt; NCMPs enjoy the same privileges and immunities as elected Members, but they cannot vote on a bill to amend the Constitution; a supply, supplementary or final supply bill; a [[money bill]], a [[motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] in the Government or a motion for the removal of the President from office.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 39(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have remarked that the NCMP scheme is premised on the assumption that the one party-dominance will continue to govern Singapore's political state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "The Legislature and the Electoral System", p.&amp;nbsp;307, para.&amp;nbsp;06.058; {{citation|author=Tsun Hang Tey|title=Singapore's Electoral System: Government by the People?|journal=Legal Studies|date=December 2008|volume=28|issue=4|pages=610–628 at 612–616|doi=10.1111/j.1748-121X.2008.00106.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the scheme gives the opposition parties a platform to share their political ideas, as well as augment opposition strength in Parliament as a check on the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "The Legislature and the Electoral System", p.&amp;nbsp;305, para.&amp;nbsp;06.053.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nominated members of parliament=====
[[Nominated Member of Parliament|Nominated members of parliament]] (NMPs) are another departure from the Westminster model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Goh Chok Tong|mplink=Goh Chok Tong|office=[[Prime Minister of Singapore#List of deputy prime ministers|First Deputy Prime Minister]] and [[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Minister for Defence]]|reading=Second|bill=Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 2)|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00061822-ZZ|date=29 November 1989|volume=54|column=705}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike NCMPs, NMPs are intended to be [[apoliticism|apolitical]] voices in Parliament&amp;nbsp;– the purpose of the NCMP scheme is to have MPs hailing from various fields and professions who can "reflect as wide a range of independent and non-partisan views as possible".&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 39(1)(c) and the 4th Schedule, para. 3(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Though NMPs may in effect be insignificant as a check on the executive, they can present alternative viewpoints which the Government may consider and even choose to respond to, particularly where they concern socially significant issues. As NMP [[Paulin Tay Straughan]] has said: "The day when we move into a two-party system where opposing voices are more visible, we will not need NMPs or NCMPs anymore. But until we get there, the NMPs have a role to play."&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Paulin Tay Straughan|mplink=Paulin Tay Straughan|office=[[Nominated Member of Parliament]]|reading=Second|bill=Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment)|billurl=http://www.parliament.gov.sg/sites/default/files/100003.pdf|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00004346-WA|date=26 April 2010|volume=87|columns=98–99}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial checks on the legislature and executive===
In ''Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis'' (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis|court=SGHC|year=2007|num=207|parallelcite=[2008] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 239|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] described the guardianship role of the judiciary in safeguarding the Constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers, holding that to prevent each arm of government from acting beyond its constitutional powers, "[u]nder the Constitution, the means adopted and recognised by all three arms of government is the judicial power of the court to review the legality of legislative and executive acts and declare them unconstitutional and of no legal effect if they contravene the provisions of the Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;''Tan Guat Neo Phyllis'', p. 310, para.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judicial independence====
{{Main article|Judicial independence in Singapore}}

[[Judicial independence in Singapore|Judicial independence]] from the other branches of government allows the judiciary to act as a check and balance on the exercise of legislative and executive power, and thus enhances the separation of powers. The extent of judicial independence in Singapore can be examined by reference to the way judges are appointed, and, in particular, the independence of the judiciary of the [[State Courts of Singapore|State Courts]]. These two aspects relate specifically to the protection of the judiciary as an institution from extraneous influences, rather than the protection of individual members of the judiciary from external pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Chan Sek Keong|title=Securing and Maintaining the Independence of the Court in Judicial Proceedings|url=http://www.sal.org.sg/digitallibrary/Lists/SAL%20Journal/Attachments/500/%282010%29%2022%20SAcLJ%20229-251%20%28March%29%20Chan%20CJ.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rrDyGXmI?url=http://www.sal.org.sg/digitallibrary/Lists/SAL%20Journal/Attachments/500/%282010%29%2022%20SAcLJ%20229-251%20%28March%29%20Chan%20CJ.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2010|journal=Singapore Academy of Law Journal|year=2010|volume=22|pages=229–251 at 231 and 235–237|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Supreme Court judiciary=====
Appointments of [[judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore#The Chief Justice, Judges of Appeal, and Judges and Judicial Commissioners of the High Court|judges]] and [[Judicial Commissioner]]s (JCs) of the [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] are made by the President, when, in his discretion, he concurs with the Prime Minister's advice on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 95(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister thus possesses the primary power of appointment of judges of the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Hor"&gt;{{citation|author=Michael Hor|title=The Independence of the Criminal Justice System in Singapore|ssrn=956056|journal=Singapore Journal of Legal Studies|year=2002|pages=497–513 at 501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Prime Minister must consult the [[Chief Justice of Singapore|Chief Justice]] when advising the President to appoint judges and JCs,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 95(2).&lt;/ref&gt; and the President is empowered to veto judicial appointments,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 22(1)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; these are relatively small roles played in the final say as to who should be appointed to the judiciary. Thus, it is said that the judiciary may not be an effective check against the abuse of executive power since the executive is likely to appoint judges who believe in the same fundamental policies. This militates against the separation of powers.&lt;ref name="Hor"/&gt; On the other hand, in a small jurisdiction like Singapore, the executive and judicial roles are inevitably intertwined as there will be very few potential appointees to the Supreme Court who have never been involved with the executive government.&lt;ref name="Hor 502"&gt;Hor, p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution contains several safeguards to protect the judiciary from political pressures. For instance, Supreme Court judges hold office until the age of 65,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 98(1).&lt;/ref&gt; and may not be removed from office except under special circumstances. The President may, on the recommendation of a tribunal of five present or former Supreme Court judges from Singapore or judges of equivalent status from any part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], remove a judge from office, if the Prime Minister or the Chief Justice acting on the Prime Minister's advice informs him of the judge's misbehaviour or inability to properly discharge the functions of his or her office.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Arts. 98(2)–(4).&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme Court judges are also constitutionally guaranteed protection from adverse remunerative changes.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 98(8); {{citation|author=Li-ann Thio|chapter=Rule of Law within a Non-liberal 'Communitarian' Democracy: The Singapore Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCXJFFudGd0C&amp;pg=PA188|editor=Randall Peerenboom|title=Asian Discourses of Rule of Law: Theories and Implementation of Rule of Law in Twelve Asian Countries, France and the U.S.|location=London|publisher=[[Routledge]]Curzon|year=2004|pages=183–224 at 188|isbn=978-0-415-32613-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the power of the executive to appoint JCs for limited periods or to hear a specific case,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Arts. 94(4)–(5).&lt;/ref&gt; and to extend the tenure of Supreme Court judges beyond the age of 65 by hiring them on a term basis,&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 94(3).&lt;/ref&gt; may motivate such judges to render decisions that are in line with government policy. As regards the latter, a mechanism for the extension of a judge's tenure might be regarded as necessary to ensure that better judges are not replaced by less capable ones.&lt;ref&gt;Hor, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====State Courts judiciary=====
In Singapore, the lower or subordinate judiciary consists of the District Judges and Magistrates of the State Courts. These judges are members of the [[Singapore Legal Service|Legal Service]], which is governed by the Legal Service Commission ("LSC").&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The President appoints State Courts judges from among the members of the Legal Service on the recommendation of the Chief Justice, who is also the chairman of the LSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Subordinate Courts Act|cap=321|ed=2007}}, ss.&amp;nbsp;9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The LSC is composed of members who enjoy differing degrees of independence from the executive branch.&lt;ref&gt;Hor, p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; These include the Chief Justice, the [[Attorney-General of Singapore|Attorney-General]] and a superior judge appointed by the Chief Justice who are highly independent from executive influence. On the other hand, the remaining persons who are the chairman and two other members of the [[Public Service Commission (Singapore)|Public Service Commission]] enjoy less security of office as they enjoy a tenure of only five years.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 107(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The subordinate judiciary in Singapore has come under more scrutiny than the superior judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;Hor, p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; State Courts judges lack tenure, and the LSC determines the terms of their appointments.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 111(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the substance of the criticisms is that the career advancement of the lower judiciary depends on the LSC, of which the Attorney-General is a member. Members of the subordinate judiciary can be transferred out of the courts to the Attorney-General's Chambers or to some other government department to serve as legal officers. Thus, there are worries of heavy legislative and executive influence over the appointment and removal of subordinate judges,&lt;ref name="Chan 247"&gt;Chan, "Securing and Maintaining the Independence of the Court", p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; and that they will be influenced by government ideology and policy in their role as judges.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Rule of Law Within a Non-Liberal 'Communitarian' Democracy", p.&amp;nbsp;190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of Senior District Judge Michael Khoo being appointed as a deputy public prosecutor in August 1981 is often cited in this context. The appointment occurred shortly after Khoo had acquitted [[J. B. Jeyaretnam]], a prominent opposition MP, of certain charges of having fraudulently transferred cheques to prevent the distribution of money to the creditors of the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]], and of making a false declaration. The reason for the transfer was never conclusively established; while it could have been motivated by executive disapproval of the acquittals, it may well have been a routine transfer with no implications for executive interference in the subordinate judiciary. The latter was the official explanation for the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of Executive Interference in the Subordinate Courts &amp;#91;Cmd. 12 of 1986; Chairman: [[T. S. Sinnathuray]]&amp;#93;|location=Singapore|publisher=Printed for the [[Government of Singapore]] by the Singapore National Printers|year=1986|oclc=16872490}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has also been said that observations about the apparent connections between the executive and judiciary are merely theoretical, and that for a more accurate analysis of the separation of powers in Singapore the "[j]udiciary must be judged on its performance in the context of actual litigation".&lt;ref name="Hor 502"/&gt; Furthermore, assertions that the subordinate judiciary is not separate from the executive since the LSC is allied to the government disregard the fact that the Chief Justice is the head of the LSC and has the final say on judicial postings. Moreover, in a small state, it may not be feasible to have a separate judicial and legal service.&lt;ref name="Chan 247"/&gt;

====Judicial review====
In ''Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu v. Public Prosecutor'' (2012),&lt;ref name="Mohammad Faizal"/&gt; the High Court explained that the doctrine of separation of powers "entails, in so far as the judicial branch is concerned, that the legislative and the executive branches of the State may not interfere with the exercise of the judicial power by the judicial branch. This total separation between the exercise of the judicial power on the one hand and the exercise of the legislative and the executive powers on the other hand is based on the rule of law."&lt;ref&gt;''Mohammad Faizal'', p. 960, para.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In Singapore, the Supreme Court upholds the separation of powers and constitutional supremacy by exercising jurisdiction to judicially review the constitutionality of legislation, thereby acting as a check upon the legislature. The High Court in ''[[Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite WorldLII|litigants=Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor|link=Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor|court=ICHRL|year=1994|num=26|parallelcite=[https://www.webcitation.org/6Bhm2ZjV3?url=http://lwb.lawnet.com.sg/legal/lgl/rss/landmark/%5B1994%5D_SGHC_207.html &amp;#91;1994&amp;#93; SGHC 207], [1994] 3 S.L.R.(R.) [''Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)''] 209, archived from [http://lwb.lawnet.com.sg/legal/lgl/rss/landmark/%5B1994%5D_SGHC_207.html the original] on 26 October 2012|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; held that the court has "the power and duty to ensure that the provisions of the Constitution are observed. The court also has a duty to declare invalid any exercise of power, legislative and executive, which exceeds the limits of the power conferred by the Constitution, or which contravenes any prohibition which the Constitution provides."&lt;ref&gt;''Chan Hiang Leng Colin'', p. 231, para.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court also exercises supervisory jurisdiction over inferior tribunals and public authorities, and can hold that acts and decisions by them which infringe [[administrative law in Singapore|administrative law rules]] are invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Ng Chye Huey v. Public Prosecutor|court=SGCA|year=2007|num=3|parallelcite=[2007] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 106|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Limits of judicial review====

=====Constitutional and legislative prohibitions=====
While the judiciary is empowered to declare ordinary legislation unconstitutional, the legislature is able to overrule such decisions by amending the Constitution. For example, in ''[[Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' (1988),&lt;ref&gt;''Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs'' [https://www.webcitation.org/64ATf2EyI?url=http://lwb.lawnet.com.sg/legal/lgl/rss/landmark/%5B1988%5D_SGCA_16.html &amp;#91;1988&amp;#93; SGCA 16], [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 525, C.A. (Singapore), archived from [http://lwb.lawnet.com.sg/legal/lgl/rss/landmark/%5B1988%5D_SGCA_16.html the original] on 24 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] adopted an objective test for reviewing ministerial discretion in the issuance of preventive detention orders under the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] ("ISA").&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Internal Security Act|titlelink=Internal Security Act (Singapore)|cap=143|ed=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, within a month of the decision, Parliament amended the Constitution and the Internal Security Act&lt;ref&gt;By the {{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=7a97e1b8-2bcb-44b1-9efa-3fa39974a056;page=0;query=DocId%3Af34d7a09-f1c1-40a9-aef1-43f20af67613%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A{{CURRENTDAY2}}%2F{{CURRENTMONTH}}%2F{{CURRENTYEAR}}%20TransactionTime%3A{{CURRENTDAY2}}%2F{{CURRENTMONTH}}%2F{{CURRENTYEAR}}%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0|no=1|year=1989}} and the {{Singapore legislation|title=Internal Security (Amendment) Act|url=http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=d12017f8-0f05-4ebc-abee-28abe10c2048;page=0;query=DocId%3Adff584d2-1d5d-4d9d-8aac-2f8d16dabdd3%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A{{CURRENTDAY2}}%2F{{CURRENTMONTH}}%2F{{CURRENTYEAR}}%20TransactionTime%3A{{CURRENTDAY2}}%2F{{CURRENTMONTH}}%2F{{CURRENTYEAR}}%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0|no=2|year=1989}}.

This form of legislative over-ruling, if done frequently, has two major detrimental effects. First, if the legislature or executive is seen as being able to manipulate the constitutional limits on their powers, this greatly impairs judicial independence. Secondly, it may thwart the perception that the judiciary is a co-equal institution in the scheme of the separation of powers, thus causing a loss of respect and public confidence in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|chapter=The Judiciary|title=A Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law|location=Singapore|publisher=Academy Publishing|year=2012|pages=451–567 at 537|isbn=978-981-07-1516-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in Parliament during the [[reading (legislature)#Second reading|Second Reading]] of the bill amending the Constitution to reverse the effect of ''Chng Suan Tze'', the [[Ministry of Law (Singapore)|Minister for Law]] [[S. Jayakumar]] quoted [[Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock|Lord Diplock]] to justify this truncation of judicial review on the basis that national security is "the responsibility of the executive government", and it is a [[threshold issues in Singapore administrative law#Justiciability|non-justiciable]] question which "the judicial process is totally inept to deal with".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service|link=Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service|court=UKHL|year=1983|num=6|parallelcite=[1985] A.C. 374 at 412|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the executive would be accountable to both Parliament and the people for its exercise of discretionary powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=S. Jayakumar|mplink=S.

Further, the political branches of government may seek to limit judicial review through the use of [[exclusion of judicial review in Singapore law#Total ouster or finality clauses|ouster clauses]]. Examples of such clauses include Article&amp;nbsp;18(9) of the Constitution, section&amp;nbsp;8B(2) of the ISA, and section&amp;nbsp;18 of the [[Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act|titlelink=Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act|cap=167A|ed=2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remains an open question whether ouster clauses are fully effective or whether, as the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held in ''[[Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission|Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission]]'' (1968),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission|link=Anisminic v Foreign Compensation Commission|court=UKHL|year=1968|num=6|parallelcite=[1969] 2 A.C. 147|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; they do not apply to the acts and decisions of public authorities that are a nullity.&lt;ref&gt;''Anisminic'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking extrajudicially, Chief Justice [[Chan Sek Keong]] suggested that any statutory clause attempting to oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts may contravene Article 93, which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, "Judicial Review – From Angst to Empathy", p.&amp;nbsp;477, para.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Doctrine of non-justiciability=====
The courts have developed an internal doctrine of self-imposed [[judicial restraint]] by which they will either decline to review what they consider a non-justiciable issue, calibrate review to a low intensity, or exercise review on limited grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "The Judiciary", pp.&amp;nbsp;538–539, para.&amp;nbsp;10.219.&lt;/ref&gt;

In matters pertaining to "high policy" such as [[jus tractatuum|treaty-making]], national defence and [[foreign relations]], the courts will generally decline judicial review of the exercise of power in deference to the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Constitutional Principles", pp.&amp;nbsp;162–163, para.&amp;nbsp;03.024.&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine stems from the idea that there are cases dealing with subject matters which fall beyond the purview of judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "The Judiciary", p. 539, para.&amp;nbsp;10.221.&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decision to intervene or not is guided by the following four principles enunciated by Judicial Commissioner [[Sundaresh Menon]] in ''Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co Ltd'' (2007):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co. Ltd.|court=SGHC|year=2007|num=24|parallelcite=[2007] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 453 at 490, para. 98|courtname=H.C.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Justiciability depends not on the source of the decision-making power, but on the subject-matter that is in question. Where it is the executive that has access to the best materials available to resolve the issue, its views should be regarded as highly persuasive, if not decisive.
*Where the decision involves matters of government policy and requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations that judges are ill-equipped to adjudicate because of their limited training, experience and access to materials, the courts should shy away from reviewing its merits.
*Where a judicial pronouncement could embarrass some other branch of government or tie its hands in the conduct of affairs traditionally regarded as falling within its purview, the courts should abstain from acting.
*In all cases of judicial review, the court should exercise restraint and take cognisance of the fact that the Singapore system of government operates within the framework of three co-equal branches. Even though all exercise of power must be within constitutional and legal bounds, there are areas of prerogative power that the democratically elected executive and legislature are entrusted to take charge of, and, in this regard, it is to the electorate, and not the judiciary, that the executive and legislature are ultimately accountable.

However, areas of high policy such as national security do not automatically apply as a "[[peremptory plea|plea in bar]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Chng Suan Tze'', p. 557, para.&amp;nbsp;94.&lt;/ref&gt; On scrutiny of such cases which are ''prima facie'' non-justiciable, the courts may be able to glean a question of law that is justiciable.&lt;ref&gt;''Lee Hsien Loong'', p. 490, para.&amp;nbsp;98.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Prosecutorial discretion=====
While Article 93 of the Constitution vests judicial power in the courts, Article 35(8) provides that "[t]he Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence". In ''Tan Guat Neo Phyllis'', the High Court stated that these two provisions expressly separate the prosecutorial function from the judicial function, and that they are coequal. As such, the two functions are not to encroach upon each other, although the court may interfere where prosecutorial power has been exercised in [[bad faith]] or unconstitutionally.&lt;ref&gt;''Tan Guat Neo Phyllis'', p. 311, para.&amp;nbsp;144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of the Elected President of Singapore represents an indigenisation of the Westminster system of government and is cast as a check against the powers enjoyed by the parliamentary executive, adding to the overall scheme of checks and balances in the doctrine of separation of powers.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Constitutional Principles", p.&amp;nbsp;161, paras.&amp;nbsp;03.021–03.022.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the institution has a limited range of functions and is essentially reactive in nature, such that it cannot be seen to be an alternative locus of political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|chapter=The President|title=A Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law|location=Singapore|publisher=Academy Publishing|year=2012|pages=385–450 at 435, para. 09.116|isbn=978-981-07-1516-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The President has power to block attempts by the Government to draw down past reserves it did not accumulate, to approve changes to key appointments, and to exercise oversight over the [[Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau]] and decisions of the executive under the ISA and the MRHA.&lt;ref name="Art 21(2)"&gt;Constitution, Art. 21(2).&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is not to enable the President to target unlawful executive actions, but lawful actions against national interests.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "The President", p.&amp;nbsp;395, para.&amp;nbsp;09.022.&lt;/ref&gt;

The impetus behind the introduction of the scheme was the Government's perception that there were "inadequate checks in our present parliamentary system of government" as a political party with a parliamentary majority, even of one seat, "can do practically anything it wishes, provided it acts lawfully" in matters pertaining to financial assets and key appointments. It was also thought that it would be prudent to institute a check "while honest men are still in charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Goh Chok Tong|office=First Deputy Prime Minister|reading=Second|bill=Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3)|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00062193-ZZ|date=4 October 1999|volume=56|columns=461–462}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the objective of protecting against fiscal mismanagement was agreed on, the method of doing so was disputed, with opposition politicians arguing that the parliamentary system would have sufficient checks if opposition parties were allowed to operate more freely and to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore Hansard|mp=Lee Siew-Choh|mplink=Lee Siew-Choh|office=[[Non-constituency Member of Parliament|NCMP]]|reading=Second|bill=Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 3)|url=http://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic.jsp?currentTopicID=00062193-ZZ|date=4 October 1999|volume=56|column=491}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidential independence====

To be an effective check, the President must be sufficiently independent and adequately empowered to change or at least block harmful or unsound government policies.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "The President", p. 412, para.&amp;nbsp;09.061.&lt;/ref&gt; Various constitutional provisions seek to achieve this. The President cannot hold any other constitutional office; if a person was an MP prior to being elected as President, the parliamentary seat is to be vacated.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Arts. 19(3)(a) and (d).&lt;/ref&gt; To stand as a candidate in a [[presidential elections in Singapore|presidential election]], a candidate is also required to resign his or her membership in any [[list of political parties in Singapore|political party]], reflecting the depoliticisation of the elective office.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 19(2)(f). The President is also prohibited from reacquiring membership in a political party following his or her election: Art.&amp;nbsp;19(3)(c). The requirements to vacate a parliamentary seat and to resign from membership of a political party do not apply to someone temporarily exercising the powers of the President: Art.&amp;nbsp;19(4).&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that the President's watchdog function is unhampered by executive intimidation, the office is maintained out of the [[President of Singapore#Maintenance: The Civil List|Civil List]] which cannot be diminished during the President's term.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 22J.&lt;/ref&gt; The President is also immune from civil suits for acts done in his official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 22K.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Discretionary powers of the President====

{{main article|Powers of the President of Singapore}}

The President has [[powers of the President of Singapore|discretionary power]] to veto certain executive decisions pertaining primarily to three areas: fiscal management, ensuring meritocracy in a corruption-free [[Singapore Civil Service|civil service]], and guardianship over [[civil liberties]] where [[judicial review in Singapore|judicial review]] has been ousted.&lt;ref name="Art 21(2)"/&gt; For the purpose of carrying out his functions, the President is entitled to access to Cabinet papers and may request information concerning the reserves of the Government, or of any [[Government of Singapore#Statutory boards|statutory board]] or government company listed in the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution. The relevant minister, or officer of the statutory board or government company, is under a duty to provide such information.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 22F.&lt;/ref&gt;

The President, however, does not have the final say over certain decisions, as Parliament may override his veto with a resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of all the elected MPs. For instance, this mechanism applies if the President vetoes key civil service appointments&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 22(2).&lt;/ref&gt; or withholds assent to bills that are likely to draw on the nation's past reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 148D.&lt;/ref&gt; A prerequisite for the exercise of the override mechanism is that the President must have disagreed with the recommendation of the Council of Presidential Advisers, which he is required consult before exercising these powers.&lt;ref&gt;For example, this is stated in the Constitution, Arts. 22(2) and 148D.&lt;/ref&gt; The override mechanism shows that the President's discretionary powers pose no obstacle to a government which continues to enjoy untrammelled power so long as it controls a clear two-thirds parliamentary majority. The weaker the Government is, the stronger the presidential check is; and the stronger the Government, the weaker the presidential blocking mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "The President", p. 415, para.&amp;nbsp;09.069.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential Council of Minority Rights as a check on the legislature===
Singapore has a unicameral legislature, meaning that there is no division of legislative authority between an [[upper house|upper]] and a [[lower house]]. Nevertheless, the [[Presidential Council for Minority Rights]] ("PCMR") can be seen as a quasi-second chamber as it plays a role in legislative review, highlighting bills containing measures that discriminate against racial and religious minorities. Thus, it plays a role in the separation of powers by acting as a check upon the executive and legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|chapter=The Presidential Council for Minority Rights|title=A Treatise on Singapore Constitutional Law|location=Singapore|publisher=Academy Publishing|year=2012|pages=361–367 at 361|isbn=978-981-07-1516-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Parliament can easily circumvent an adverse report on a bill by the PCMR as it can continue to present the bill to the President for assent if not less than two-thirds of all the elected MPs endorse a [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] in favour of such action.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 78(6)(c).&lt;/ref&gt; The PCMR's powers of legislative review are further attenuated because the Constitution designates certain types of bills as falling outside the ambit of its scrutiny, namely, [[money bill]]s, bills certified by the Prime Minister as affecting "the defence or the security of Singapore" or relating to "public safety, peace or good order in Singapore", and urgent bills.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 78(7).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the PCMR has been said to be a weak institution that lacks coercive power.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "The Presidential Council for Minority Rights", p.&amp;nbsp;366, para.&amp;nbsp;07.017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''service-level agreement''' ('''SLA''') is a commitment between a service provider and a client. Particular aspects of the service&amp;nbsp;– quality, availability, responsibilities&amp;nbsp;– are agreed between the service provider and the service user.&lt;ref name="KearneyServ11"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z306GUfFL5gC |chapter=The SLA Model |title=Service Level Agreements for Cloud Computing |author=Kearney, K.T.; Torelli, F. |editor=Wieder, P.; Butler, J.M.; Theilmann, W.; Yahyapour, R. |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC |pages=43–68 |year=2011 |isbn=9781461416142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common component of SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract. As an example, [[Internet service provider]]s and [[Telephone company|telcos]] will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in  ''[[mean time between failures]]'' (MTBF), ''[[mean time to repair]]'' or ''[[mean time to recovery]]'' (MTTR); identifying which party is responsible for reporting faults or paying fees; responsibility for various data rates; [[throughput]]; [[jitter]]; or similar measurable details.

==Overview==
A service-level agreement is an agreement between two or more parties, where one is the customer and the others are service providers. This can be a legally binding formal or an informal "contract" (for example, internal department relationships). The agreement may involve separate organizations, or different teams within one organization. Contracts between the service provider and other third parties are often (incorrectly) called SLAs – because the level of service has been set by the (principal) customer, there can be no "agreement" between third parties; these agreements are simply "contracts." [[Operational-level agreement]]s or OLAs, however, may be used by internal groups to support SLAs. If some aspect of a service has not been agreed with the customer, it is not an "SLA".

SLAs commonly include many components, from a definition of services to the termination of agreement.&lt;ref name="SLAZone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sla-zone.co.uk/ |title=The Service Level Agreement Zone |work=SLA Information Zone |publisher=Service Level Agreement Zone |date=2015 |accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that SLAs are consistently met, these agreements are often designed with specific lines of [[wikt:demarcation|demarcation]] and the parties involved are required to meet regularly to create an open forum for communication. Rewards and penalties applying to the provider are often specified.  Most SLAs also leave room for periodic (annual) revisitation to make changes.&lt;ref name="ShacklettFive11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/key-points-for-sla.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222042328/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/key-points-for-sla.aspx |title=Five Key Points for Every SLA |author=Shacklett, M.E. |publisher=Dell |date=12 January 2011 |archivedate=22 December 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since late 1980s SLA's have been used by fixed line telecom operators. SLAs are so widely used these days that larger organizations have many different SLAs existing within the company itself. Two different units in an organization script a SLA with one unit being the customer and another being the service provider. This practice helps to maintain the same quality of service amongst different units in the organization and also across multiple locations of the organization. This internal scripting of SLA also helps to compare the quality of service between an in-house department and an external service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:142006455X|title=Advances in Network Management|last=Ding|first=Jianguo|publisher=Auerbach Publications|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4200-6455-1|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The output received by the customer as a result of the service provided is the main focus of the service level agreement.

Service level agreements are also defined at different levels:
* '''Customer-based SLA''': An agreement with an individual customer group, covering all the services they use. For example, an SLA between a supplier (IT service provider) and the finance department of a large organization for the services such as finance system, payroll system, billing system, procurement/purchase system, etc.
* '''Service-based SLA''': An agreement for all customers using the services being delivered by the service provider'''.''' For example:
** A mobile service provider offers a routine service to all the customers and offers certain maintenance as a part of an offer with the universal charging.
** An email system for the entire organization. There are chances of difficulties arising in this type of SLA as level of the services being offered may vary for different customers (for example, head office staff may use high-speed [[Local area network|LAN]] connections while local offices may have to use a lower speed leased line).
* '''Multilevel SLA''': The SLA is split into the different levels, each addressing different set of customers for the same services, in the same SLA.
** '''Corporate-level SLA''': Covering all the generic [[Service level management#Service level management|service level management]] (often abbreviated as SLM) issues appropriate to every customer throughout the organization. These issues are likely to be less volatile and so updates (SLA reviews) are less frequently required.
** '''Customer-level SLA''': covering all SLM issues relevant to the particular customer group, regardless of the services being used.
** '''Service-level SLA''': covering all SLM issue relevant to the specific services, in relation to this specific customer group.

== Components ==
A well defined and typical SLA will contain the following components:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verma|first=Dinesh|date=September 2004|title=Service level agreements on IP networks|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/people/d/dverma/papers/SLAOverview.pdf|journal=IEEE|volume=92|issue=9|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Type of service to be provided''': It specifies the type of service and any additional details of type of service to be provided. In case of an IP network connectivity, type of service will describe functions such as operation and maintenance of networking equipment, connection bandwidth to be provided, etc.
* '''The service's desired performance level, especially its reliability and responsiveness''': A reliable service will be the one which suffers minimum disruptions in a specific amount of time and is available at almost all times. A service with good responsiveness will perform the desired action promptly after the customer requests for it.
* '''Monitoring process and service level reporting:''' This component describes how the performance levels are supervised and monitored. This process involves gathering of different type of statistics, how frequently this statistics will be collected and how this statistics will be accessed by the customers.
* '''The steps for reporting issues with the service''': This component will specify the contact details to report the problem to and the order in which details about the issue have to be reported. The contract will also include a time range in which the problem will be looked upon and also till when the issue will be resolved.
* '''Response and issue resolution time-frame''': Response time-frame is the time period by which the service provider will start the investigation of the issue. Issue resolution time-frame is the time period by which the current service issue will be resolved and fixed.
* '''Repercussions for service provider not meeting its commitment''': If the provider is not able to meet the requirements as stated in SLA then service provider will have to face consequences for the same. These consequences may include customer's right to terminate the contract or ask for a refund for losses incurred by the customer due to failure of service.

==Common metrics==
Service-level agreements can contain numerous service-[[performance metrics]] with corresponding [[service-level objective]]s. A common case in [[IT Service Management|IT-service management]] is a [[call center]] or [[Service Desk (ITSM)|service desk]]. Metrics commonly agreed to in these cases include:
* '''Abandonment Rate''': Percentage of calls abandoned while waiting to be answered.
* '''ASA''' (Average Speed to Answer): Average time (usually in seconds) it takes for a call to be answered by the service desk.
* '''TSF''' (Time Service Factor): Percentage of calls answered within a definite [[timeframe]], e.g., 80% in 20&amp;nbsp;seconds.
* '''FCR''' (First-Call Resolution): Percentage of incoming calls that can be resolved without the use of a callback or without having the caller call back the helpdesk to finish resolving the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Desmarais|first=Mike|date=2012|title=First Call Resolution|url=http://www.sqmgroup.com/pdf/fcr-book-excerpt2.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''TAT''' ([[Turnaround time|Turn-Around Time]]): Time taken to complete a certain task.
* '''MTTR''' ([[Mean time to recovery|Mean Time To Recover]]): Time taken to recover after an outage of service.

'''[[Uptime]]''' is also a common metric, often used for data services such as [[shared hosting]], [[virtual private server]]s and [[dedicated servers]]. Common agreements include percentage of network uptime, power uptime, number of scheduled [[maintenance window]]s, etc.

Many SLAs track to the [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] specifications when applied to IT services.

==Specific examples==

===Backbone Internet providers===
It is not uncommon for an internet backbone service provider (or [[network service provider]]) to explicitly state its own SLA on its website.&lt;ref name="NTT_SLA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us.ntt.net/support/sla/network.cfm |title=Global IP Network SLA |publisher=NTT Communications |accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VerizonSLA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.verizonenterprise.com/terms/global_latency_sla.xml |title=Global Latency and Packet Delivery SLA |publisher=Verizon |accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AT&amp;T_SLA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.att.com/gen/general?pid=6622 |title=Business Edition - AT&amp;T U-verse Voice and TV - Terms of Service (TOS) and AT&amp;T Broadband - Service Level Agreement (SLA) |publisher=AT&amp;T |accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] does not expressly mandate that companies have SLAs, but it does provide a framework for firms to do so in Sections 251 and 252.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Telecommunications Act of 1996#SEC. 101. ESTABLISHMENT OF PART II OF TITLE II.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Section 252(c)(1) for example ("Duty to Negotiate") requires [[Incumbent local exchange carrier]]s (ILECs) to negotiate in good faith about matters such as resale and access to rights of way.

===WSLA===
A '''web service level agreement''' ('''WSLA''') is a standard for service level agreement compliance monitoring of [[web service]]s. It allows authors to specify the performance metrics associated with a web service application, desired performance targets, and actions that should be performed when performance is not met.

[http://www.research.ibm.com/people/a/akeller/Data/WSLASpecV1-20030128.pdf WSLA Language Specification, version 1.0] was published by IBM on January 28, 2001.

===Cloud computing===
The underlying benefit of [[cloud computing]] is shared resources, which is supported by the underlying nature of a shared infrastructure environment. Thus, SLAs span across the cloud and are offered by service providers as a service-based agreement rather than a customer-based agreement. Measuring, monitoring and reporting on cloud performance is based on the end UX or their ability to consume resources. The downside of cloud computing relative to SLAs is the difficulty in determining the root cause of service interruptions due to the complex nature of the environment.

As applications are moved from dedicated hardware into the [[Cloud computing|cloud]], they need to achieve the same or even more demanding levels of service than classical installations. SLAs for cloud services focus on characteristics of the data center and more recently include characteristics of the network (see [[Carrier Cloud|carrier cloud]]) to support end-to-end SLAs.&lt;ref name="RuedaTheServ11"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z306GUfFL5gC |chapter=The Service Aggregator Use Case Scenario |title=Service Level Agreements for Cloud Computing |author=Rueda, J.L.; Gómez, S.G.; Chimento, A.E. |editor=Wieder, P.; Butler, J.M.; Theilmann, W.; Yahyapour, R. |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC |pages=329–342 |year=2011 |isbn=9781461416142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any SLA management strategy considers two well-differentiated phases: negotiating the contract and monitoring its fulfilment in real time. Thus, SLA management encompasses the SLA contract definition: the basic schema with the [[Quality of service|QoS]] parameters; SLA negotiation; SLA monitoring; SLA violation detection; and SLA enforcement—according to defined policies.

The main point is to build a new layer upon the grid, cloud, or [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] middleware able to create a negotiation mechanism between the providers and consumers of services. An example is the EU–funded Framework 7 research project, SLA@SOI,&lt;ref name="ButlerMotiv11"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z306GUfFL5gC |chapter=Motivation and Overview |title=Service Level Agreements for Cloud Computing |author=Butler, J.M.; Yahyapour, R.; Theilmann, W. |editor=Wieder, P.; Butler, J.M.; Theilmann, W.; Yahyapour, R. |publisher=Springer Science+Business Media, LLC |pages=3–12 |year=2011 |isbn=9781461416142}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is researching aspects of multi-level, multi-provider SLAs within service-oriented infrastructure and cloud computing, while another EU-funded project, VISION Cloud,&lt;ref name="VillariHowTo12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SB-6BQAAQBAJ |chapter=How to Federate VISION Cloud through SAML/Shibboleth Authentication |title=Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing |author=Villari, M.; Tusa, F.; Celesti, A.; Puliafito, A. |editor=De Paoli, F.; Pimentel, E.; Zavattaro, G. |publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg |year=2012 |pages=259–274 |isbn=9783642334276}}&lt;/ref&gt; has provided results with respect to content-oriented SLAs.

===Outsourcing===
[[Outsourcing]] involves the transfer of responsibility from an organization to a supplier. This new arrangement is managed through a contract that may include one or more SLAs. The contract may involve financial penalties and the right to terminate if any of the SLAs metrics are consistently missed. Setting, tracking and managing SLAs is an important part of the [[outsourcing relationship management]] (ORM) discipline. Specific SLAs are typically negotiated up front as part of the outsourcing contract and used as one of the primary tools of outsourcing governance.

In software development, specific SLAs can apply to application outsourcing contracts in line with standards in [[software quality]], as well as recommendations provided by neutral organizations like [[CISQ]], which has published numerous papers on the topic (such as ''Using Software Measurement in SLAs''&lt;ref name="CurtisUsing15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://it-cisq.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Using-Software-Measurement-in-SLAs-Integrating-CISQ-Size-and-Structural-Quality-Measures-into-Contractual-Relationships.pdf |format=PDF |title=Using Software Measurement in SLAs: Integrating CISQ Size and Structural Quality Measures into Contractual Relationships |author=Curtis, B.; Herron, D.; Subramanyam, J. |publisher=CISQ |date=July 2015 |accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that are available to the public.

[[File:1983 referendum stamp ZA.jpg|thumb|Stamp in identity document of a white South African recording their participation in the 1983 constitutional reform referendum]]
A '''referendum on a new constitution''' was held in South Africa on 2 November 1983 in which the [[White South African|white]] population was given the opportunity to approve or reject the [[South African Constitution of 1983|Constitution of 1983]]. This constitution introduced the [[Tricameral Parliament]], in which [[coloured]] and [[Indian South African|Indian]] South Africans would be represented in separate parliamentary chambers, while [[black South African]]s would remain unrepresented. The referendum passed with 66.3% of voters voting "Yes"; consequently the new constitution came into force on 3 September 1984.

==Background==
In 1981 the [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]] was abolished and replaced with the [[President's Council]], which was an advisory body consisting of sixty nominated members from the white, coloured, Indian and Chinese population groups. Following a request by Prime Minister [[P.W. Botha]], the President's Council presented a set of proposals in 1982 for [[constitution]]al and political reform. This proposal called for the implementation of "power sharing" between the white, coloured and Indian communities.

The right wing of the ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) rejected this proposal and a group of its [[Member of parliament|MPs]], led by Dr. [[Andries Treurnicht]], a [[cabinet minister]] and the leader of the NP in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] province, broke away to form the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]] (CP) in order to fight for a return to [[apartheid]] in its original form. However, Botha continued to be in favour of implementing the President's Council proposal and in 1983 the NP government introduced a new constitutional framework. A referendum was called for in order to determine public support for the reforms amongst white voters. The [[New Republic Party (South Africa)|New Republic Party]] led by [[Vause Raw]] supported the new constitution, although it continued to call for black representation in Parliament.

==Opposition==
Both the [[Progressive Federal Party]] (PFP), which objected to the exclusion of blacks, as well as the CP, which objected to the participation of coloureds and Indians, campaigned for a "No" vote. However, many PFP followers and parts of the anti-government [[English language]] [[Mass media|press]] supported the new constitution as "a step in the right direction". The conservative opposition to the reforms used banners with the text "Rhodesia voted yes – vote no!" reflecting on the transformation to majority rule in [[Rhodesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Godwin|first=Peter|title=Whose Kith and Kin Now?|url=http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/london_sunday_times/904G-000-005.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805050335/http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/london_sunday_times/904G-000-005.html|archivedate=5 August 2004|newspaper=The Sunday Times Magazine|date=25 March 1984|accessdate=9 August 2013|quote=Those with unbendable prejudices (the most furiously racist of them being post-UDI immigrants) began to leave for South Africa. There they spread horror stories about Zimbabwe and, in the recent South African referendum on giving Coloureds and Indians the vote, flocked to vote for the right-wing parties behind such banners as 'Rhodesia voted yes – vote no!'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The response of Coloured, Indian and black leaders were mixed. The new constitution was rejected by most Bantustan leaders and the Urban Councils Association of South Africa (representing the black township administrations) because it did not provide for black representation. Coloured and Indian parties that intended to participate in the Tricameral Parliament but also insisted on extending representation to the black majority. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psimg.jstor.org/fsi/img/pdf/t0/10.5555/al.sff.document.boo19840000.042.000_final.pdf |title=Survey of race relations in South Africa: 1983
|publisher=[[South African Institute of Race Relations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF) was launched as a non-racial coalition to oppose the referendum and the subsequent elections for the coloured and Indian chambers in parliament.

'''Structure, sequence and organization''' ('''SSO''') is a term used in the United States to define a basis for comparing one software work to another in order to determine if copying has occurred that infringes on copyright, even when the second work is not a literal copy of the first.  
The term was introduced in the case of ''Whelan v. Jaslow'' in 1986.{{sfn|Kappel|1991|p=699}}
The method of comparing the SSO of two software products has since evolved in attempts to avoid the extremes of over-protection and under-protection, both of which are considered to discourage innovation.{{sfn|Abramson|2001|p=57}} 
More recently, the concept has been used in ''[[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]''{{sfn|Lee|2012}}

==Whelan v. Jaslow==
{{main|Whelan v. Jaslow}}
''Whelan Assocs.,  Inc. v. Jaslow  Dental Laboratory, Inc.'' was a landmark case in defining principles that applied to copyright of computer software.{{sfn|Graham|1999|p=88}}
Whelan had developed software for Jaslow to manage the operations of a dental laboratory, and later took it to market under the trade name ''Dentalab''.  
Jaslow became engaged in selling the ''Dentalab'' software.{{sfn|Kappel|1991|p=704}}
He later formed a new company named Dentcom and wrote a program in a different computer language but with similar functionality that he called ''Dentlab'', marketing it as a ''Dentalab'' successor.  Whelan filed a suit in federal court in Pennsylvania alleging that the ''Dentlab'' software violated Whelan's copyrights in the ''Dentalab'' software.
Whelan won the case and was awarded damages on the basis that ''Dentlab'' had substantially similar structure and overall organization.{{sfn|Graham|1999|p=89}}

The district court ruling in ''Whelan'' drew on the established doctrine that even when the component parts of a work cannot be copyrightable, the structure and organization of a work may be.{{sfn|Hamilton|Sabety|1997|p=241}}
The court also drew support from the 1985 ''SAS Inst. Inc. v. S&amp;H Computer Sys. Inc.'' in which it had been found that copyright protected organizational and structural details, not just specific lines of source or object code.{{#tag:ref
|Software is written in [[source code]], a collection of instructions written in a human-readable programming language.  With many languages this is translated by a compiler into [[object code]], where the instructions are in a form that the computer can execute.  Source code copying may be crudely disguised by changing the names of procedures and variables.  This form of disguise will be immediately visible when the object code is compared, since the object code will be the same.
|group=fn}}{{sfn|Epstein|2006|p=11-27}}
Sequence, structure and organization (SSO) in this case was defined as "the manner in which the program operates, controls and regulates the computer in receiving, assembling, calculating, retaining, correlating, and producing useful information."{{sfn|Kappel|1991|p=699}}
SSO refers to non-literal elements of computer programs that include "data input formats, file structures, design, organization and flow of the code, screen outputs or user interfaces, and the flow and sequencing of the screens.".{{sfn|Scott|2006|p=5-56}} However, the SAS Inst. Inc. V. S&amp;H Computer Sys. Inc. demonstrated that copyright can exist in derived works from publicly funded developed source code in the public domain &lt;ref&gt;S &amp; H COMPUTER SYSTEMS v. SAS Institute, Inc., 568 F. Supp. 416 - Dist. Court, MD Tennessee 1983&lt;/ref&gt; rather than address the issue of SSO.

Jaslow appealed the decision.
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit noted that computer programs are literary works under U.S. law.{{sfn|Hansen|2006|p=170}}
The court reasoned that with literary works a non-literal element is protected to the extent that it is an expression of an idea rather than the idea itself.  By analogy, the purpose or function of a software work would be the work's "idea", while everything not necessary to that purpose or function would be part of the expression of the idea. The expression would be protected, although the basic purpose or function would not.{{sfn|Kappel|1991|p=704}}
On this basis the Court of Appeals upheld the district court's ruling of copyright violation due to similarity of SSO.{{sfn|Graham|1999|p=91}}

==Early adoption and criticism==
For the next few years most, but not all, circuit courts accepted the ''Whelan'' decision on SSO in one form or another.{{sfn|Kappel|1991|p=705}} This resulted in a period of tight protection for software, since almost everything other than the broad purpose of a software work would be protected. The only exception was where the functionality could only be achieved in a very small number of ways.  In these cases there could be no protection due to the [[Merger doctrine (copyright law)|merger doctrine]], which applies when the expression and the idea are inextricably merged.{{sfn|Abramson|2001|p=57}}

In one case a court found that a defendant had infringed the right to prepare a derivative work when they copied the sequence, structure, and organization of the plaintiff's file formats, screen, reports, and transaction codes, even though different data fields were present.{{sfn|Stapleton|2002|p=9.6}}
In 1986 the ruling in ''[[Broderbund Software, Inc v. Unison World, Inc]]'' appeared to prevent software developers from marketing products with the same or similar user interfaces, regardless of whether there was anything in common in the underlying code.{{sfn|Kappel|1991|p=705}}
In the 1990 case of ''Lotus v. Paperback'' the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts decided that Paperback's VP-Planner software violated the copyright of Lotus's 1-2-3 spreadsheet program since it had the same user interface, even though the underlying code was completely different.{{sfn|Davidson|1997|p=115}}

A technical criticism of ''Whelan'' is that it fails to distinguish between the sequence in which instructions are presented in the text of a program and the sequence in which the instructions are executed - the program's behavior. Both the textual and behavioral aspects have their own SSO, but a programmer would see the textual SSO as relatively unimportant.{{sfn|Galler|1995|p=87}}
A related point is that although the text of a computer program may be an "original work of authorship", protected by copyright laws. The algorithms and designs that the program embodies may be better considered to be "processes, procedures, systems, methods of operation", which are explicitly excluded from copyright protection although they may be protectable by patents.{{sfn|Hansen|2006|p=196}}
The distinction between the code's SSO, which is protected by copyright, and the protocol or algorithm, which is patentable, is however extremely difficult to maintain.{{sfn|Granstrand|2003|p=407}}

The ''Whelan'' ruling has been criticized as being "dangerously broad".  
By saying that the purpose of the program was to assist a Dental lab operation, and that anything not essential to that purpose was an expression, 
it left open a wide range of functions that could be deemed "not essential" and therefore subject to protection.{{sfn|Kappel|1991|p=708}}
In the 1988 ''Healthcare Affiliated Services, Inc. v. Lippany'' the court took a position more in line with the idea-expression merger concept, saying that the defendant's choice of scope, variables to be used  and other aspects of what its software would do did not constitute the SSO.{{sfn|Scott|2006|p=5-57}}
In 1987 the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the extension of copyright protection to the non-literal elements of computer programs in 
the case of ''Plains Cotton Cooperative Ass'n v. Goodpasture Computer Serv''.
The court held that input formats were idea rather than expression and refused to extend protection to these formats. 
The court said: "We decline to embrace ''Whelan''."{{sfn|Kappel|1991|p=705}}

In ''[[Computer Associates Int. Inc. v. Altai Inc.]]'' in 1992 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the conclusion in ''Whelan'' that the structure, sequence and organization of a program might by protected by copyright where appropriate.{{sfn|Takeyama|Gordon|Towse|2005|p=11}}
However, the court went on to say, "As we have already noted, a computer program's ultimate function or purpose is the composite result of interacting subroutines. Since each Subroutine is itself a program, and thus, may be said to have  its own 'idea,' Whelan's general formulation that a program's overall Purpose equates with the program's idea is descriptively inadequate."{{sfn|Hamilton|Sabety|1997|p=250}}

The Second Circuit introduced the three-step [[Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test]], and several other circuits later adopted this test. In the abstraction step the court identifies  similarities starting from the object and source code and moving up to higher levels of abstraction.  In the filtration step any legitimate similarities are discarded.{{sfn|Abramson|2001|pp=49-50}} 
Elements removed in this step include obvious expressive interpretations of broad ideas, elements dictated by efficiency or external considerations, elements in the public domain and industry standards.{{sfn|Davidson|1997|p=116}}
In the comparison step the court decides whether there is enough similarity between the remaining elements to constitute infringement, and if so the severity of the infringement.{{sfn|Abramson|2001|pp=49-50}}

One effect of the ''Altai'' case may have been that companies that thought they were protected under ''Whelan'', and had therefore not filed patent applications, now found themselves exposed.{{sfn|Graham|1999|p=92}}
The ''Altai'' case may have gone too far, in effect removing protection from all but the literal elements of a program and thus leading to underprotection. 
Aware of this risk, many courts that followed the ''Altai'' ruling seem to have in practice performed less filtration than was required by the test.{{sfn|Abramson|2001|p=57}}
However, most circuits have accepted ''Altai'' in preference to ''Whelan''.{{sfn|Epstein|2006|p=11-26}}

==Later decisions==
Both the code and the "look and feel" of a software product have structure, sequence and organization. 
Technically there is little or no connection between the two.
The same look and feel can be created by entirely different software products, and two internally very similar software products may present very different look and feel.
However, the courts have tried to maintain common standards and tests for both types of SSO.{{sfn|Epstein|2006|p=11-17}}

Following the 1986 ''Broderbund'' ruling, [[Lotus Development Corporation]] sued two competing spreadsheet program vendors for copying the look and feel of their [[Lotus 1-2-3]] spreadsheet program, and [[Apple Computers]] sued [[Microsoft]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]] for copying the [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh operating system]]'s use of icons, pull-down menus and a mouse pointing device.  Both companies drew criticism, since key elements of their look and feel had been introduced earlier by [[VisiCalc]] and [[Xerox]].
A 1992 federal court finding against Apple largely rejected the idea that copyright law could protect look and feel.
The Lotus case went to the Supreme Court, which could not reach a decision, thus by default confirming the lower court's 1995 declaration that the words and commands used to manipulate the spreadsheet were a "method of operation", which is not subject to copyright.{{sfn|Overbeck|Belmas|2011|p=270-271}}

Only patent law can protect the behavior of a computer program.
Competitors may create programs that provide essentially the same functionality as a protected program as long as they do not copy the code.
The trend has been for courts to say that even if there are non-literal SSO similarities, there must be proof of copying. 
Some relevant court decisions allow for reverse-engineering to discover ideas that are not subject to copyright within a protected program.
The ideas can be implemented in a competing program as long as the developers do not copy the original expression.{{sfn|Yusuf|2008|pp=51-52}}
With a [[clean room design]] approach one team of engineers derives a functional specification from the original code, 
and then a second team uses that specification to design and build the new code.
This was piloted in the mid-1980s by a team from [[Phoenix Technologies]] to produce a [[BIOS]] functionally equivalent to that of the [[IBM Personal Computer]] without infringing on IBM's copyright.{{sfn|Schwartz|2001}}

In August 2010 [[Oracle Corporation]] initiated a lawsuit against [[Google]] claiming a combination of patent and copyright violations related to Google's implementation of the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] in Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]].
On May 7, 2012 a jury decided that Google had infringed the SSO copyright of 37 Java [[Application programming interface]] (API) packages, but were unable to decide whether this was fair use.{{sfn|Ritti|2012}}
The judge asked both Google and Oracle to provide further detail of their positions over whether an API or a programming language such as Java can be copyrighted.
He also asked for both sides to comment on a ruling by the [[European Court of Justice]] in a similar case that found "Neither the functionality of a computer program nor the programming language and the format of data files used in a computer program in order to exploit certain of its functions constitute a form of expression. Accordingly, they do not enjoy copyright protection."{{sfn|King|Farber|2012}}
On May 31, 2012 the judge ruled that "So long as the specific code used to implement a method is different, anyone is free under the Copyright Act to write his or her own code to carry out exactly the same function or specification of any methods used in the Java API."{{sfn|Mullin|2012}}

In reviewing the ''[[Oracle v. Google]]'' case history, the court noted:{{blockquote|...the above summary of the development of the law reveals a trajectory in which enthusiasm for protection of "structure, sequence and organization" peaked in the 1980s, most notably in the Third Circuit’s ''Whelan'' decision. That phrase has not been re-used by the Ninth Circuit since ''Johnson Controls'' in 1989, a decision affirming preliminary injunction. Since then, the trend of the copyright decisions has been more cautious. This trend has been driven by fidelity to Section 102(b) and recognition of the danger of conferring a monopoly by copyright over what Congress expressly warned should be conferred only by patent. This is not to say that infringement of the structure, sequence and organization is a dead letter. To the contrary, it is not a dead letter. It is to say that the ''Whelan'' approach has given way to the ''Computer Associates'' approach, including in our own circuit. See ''[[Sega Enters., Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc.]]'', 977 F.2d 1510, 1525 (9th Cir. 1992); ''[[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.]]'', 35 F.3d 1435, 1445 (9th Cir. 1994).{{sfn|Alsup|2012}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20693">The '''Treaty of Tientsin''', signed on 9 June 1885, officially ended the [[Sino-French War]].  The [[unequal treaty]], in ten articles, restated in greater detail the main provisions of the [[Tientsin Accord]], signed between France and China on 11 May 1884.  As Article 2 required China to recognise the French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin established by the [[Treaty of Hue (1884)|Treaty of Hue]] in June 1884, implicitly abandoning her own claims to suzerainty over Vietnam, the treaty formalised France's victory in the [[Sino-French War]].

== Background ==
[[Image:LiHungChang.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Li Hung-chang]]
In December 1884, alarmed by Japanese ambitions in Korea, [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] ordered her ministers to extricate China from the undeclared war with France that had broken out on 23 August. Important French victories in Tonkin and Formosa in February and early March 1885 strengthened her desire to end the Sino-French War, and although the Chinese won an unexpected victory in Tonkin in late March, defeating General de Négrier's 2nd Brigade at [[Battle of Bang Bo|Bang Bo]] and reoccupying [[Retreat from Lạng Sơn|Lạng Sơn]], this success was counterbalanced by the simultaneous French capture of the [[Pescadores Campaign|Pescadores Islands]].  Despite the [[Tonkin Affair|fall of Jules Ferry's ministry]] in France at the end of March in the wake of the [[retreat from Lạng Sơn]], China's position in early April 1885 was critical. Seizing the opportunity offered by the fall of the Ferry ministry, the Chinese agreed to implement the provisions of the May 1884 [[Tientsin Accord]], which recognised France's protectorate over Vietnam. In return, the French dropped their longstanding demand for an indemnity for the [[Bắc Lệ ambush]]. After a flurry of negotiations in Paris in the first days of April 1885, peace was made on this basis.&lt;ref&gt;Thomazi, 258–62&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminaries of peace between France and China were signed on 4 April 1885. The preliminary peace protocol provided for an immediate ceasefire in both Tonkin and Formosa. The French agreed to lift their blockade of Formosa immediately, and the Chinese agreed to withdraw their armies from Tonkin by the end of May 1885. As a surety for Chinese good faith, the French maintained their 'rice blockade' of the Yangtze River and the Chinese ports of Chen-hai (镇海) and Pak-hoi (北海), and continued to occupy Keelung and the Pescadores Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Billot, 406&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese punctiliously observed the terms of the peace settlement, and both the Yunnan and [[Guangxi Army|Guangxi armies]] dutifully withdrew from Tonkin. Recognising the practical difficulties faced by Tang Jingsong's Yunnan Army, deep in Tonkinese territory around Hưng Hóa, the French extended the deadline specified in the accord of 4 April for its withdrawal, and the Yunnan Army finally crossed the border into China at Lào Cai on 2 June 1885. Under pressure from the Chinese commanders, Liu Yung-fu's Black Flag Army also withdrew from Tonkinese territory. Satisfied that China intended to honour its obligations, the French government consented to the conclusion of a definitive [[peace treaty]] between France and China.

A comprehensive peace treaty in ten articles, based on the provisions of the [[Tientsin Accord]] of 11 May 1884, was signed at Tientsin on 9 June 1885, by [[Li Hung-chang]] for China and by [[Jules Patenôtre des Noyers|Jules Patenôtre]] for France.

Li Hung-chang had earlier negotiated the [[Tientsin Accord]], and had been widely criticised in China for giving away too much to France.  Conservative literati prevented the provisions of the Tientsin Accord from being put into effect, resulting in a clash between French and Chinese troops at [[Bắc Lệ Ambush|Bắc Lệ]] in Tonkin. This confrontation had led directly to the outbreak of the [[Sino-French War]] on 23 August 1884. Although the hardline elements in the Ch'ing court were unable to prevent the empress dowager from again appointing Li Hung-chang to negotiate a peace treaty with the French, they insisted that Li was accompanied by two members of the Tsungli Yamen, Hsi Chen and Teng Ch'eng-hsiu (鄧承修). Teng Ch'eng-hsiu was a prominent member of the hardline Purist party (''ch'ing-liu'') and his appointment, a deliberate insult to Li Hung-chang, was one of the last occasions on which the Purists were able to influence court policy. Discredited by China's defeat in the Sino-French War, the Purists rapidly lost influence at court thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Eastman, 200–201&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text of the treaty (English translation)==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Commerce, concluded between France and China at Tientsin on 9 June 1885
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The President of the French Republic and His Majesty the Emperor of China, animated, the one and the other, by an equal desire to put an end to the difficulties they have given each other by their simultaneous interventions in the affairs of Annam, and wishing to reestablish and ameliorate the former relations of friendship and commerce which existed between France and China, have resolved to conclude a new treaty responding to the common interests of the two nations, based on the Preliminary Convention signed at Tientsin, 11 May 1884, and ratified by imperial Decree, 13 April 1885.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To that effect, the two High Contracting Parties have designated their plenipotentiaries, to wit: the President of the French Republic:  M. JULES PATENÔTRE, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of France in China, Officer of the Légion d'Honneur, Grand-Cross of the Polar Star of Sweden, etc; and His Majesty the Emperor of China: LI HUNG-CHANG, Imperial Commissioner, First Grand Secretary of State, Tutor of the Heir Presumptive, Superintendent of Trade of the Northern Ports, Governor-General of the Province of Chihli, holder of the First Degree of the Third Rank of Nobility, with the title ''Souyi''; assisted by HSI CHEN, Imperial Commissioner, Member of the Council of Foreign Affairs, President of the Ministry of Justice, Administrator of the Treasure of the Ministry of Finances, Director of the Schools for the Education of the Hereditary Officers of the Left Wing of the Tartar Army of Peking, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Contingent of the Yellow Bordered Banner; and TENG CH’ENG-HSIU, Imperial Commissioner, Member of the Ceremonial Estate; who, after communicating to each other their plenipotentiary powers, which they have recognized as in good and due form, are agreed on the following Articles.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ARTICLE ONE
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
France engages herself to reestablish and maintain order in the provinces of Annam which border upon the Chinese Empire.  To that effect, she will take the measures necessary to disperse or expel the bands of pillagers and vagabonds which compromise the public tranquility, thus preventing it from reforming itself.  Nevertheless, French troops will not cross the frontier which separates Tonkin from China, a frontier which France promises to respect and guarantee against all aggression.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On her side, China engages herself to disperse or expel the bands which take refuge in her provinces bordering on Tonkin, and to disperse those which seek to organize themselves on her territory in order to spread trouble among the populations placed under the protection of France, and in consideration of the guarantees which have been accorded to her for the security of her frontier, she categorically pledges not to send troops to Tonkin.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The High Contracting Parties will fix by a special convention the conditions under which wrongdoers will be extradited between China and Annam. Chinese colonists or former soldiers who live peaceably in Annam, earning their living by agriculture, industry or commerce and whose conduct is above reproach, shall enjoy the same security for their persons and their goods as French protégés.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ARTICLE TWO
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
China, having decided to do nothing which could compromise the work of pacification undertaken by France, engages herself to respect, in the present and in the future, the treaties, conventions and arrangements directly concluded or to be concluded between France and Annam.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In those things which concern the relationships between China and Annam, it is intended that they will be of a nature such as not to affront the dignity of the Chinese Empire, and not to lead to any violation of the present treaty.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ARTICLE THREE
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After an interval of six months from the signature of the present treaty, commissioners designated by the High Contracting Parties will go to delineate the frontier between China and Tonkin.  They will place, wherever there is need, boundary markers designed to clearly delineate the line of demarcation.  In the case where they can not agree among themselves on the placement of the markers or on the rectifications of detail in the actual frontier of Tonkin which it may be necessary to make in the common interest of both parties, they will refer it to their respective governments.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ARTICLE FOUR
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the frontier has been identified, the French, French protégés and foreign inhabitants of Tonkin who wish to cross it in order to go to China will only be allowed to do so after having previously furnished themselves with passports delivered by Chinese authorities at the frontier on the request of the French authorities.  For Chinese subjects, an authorization by the imperial Frontier Authorities will suffice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chinese subjects who wish to travel from China to Tonkin, by the land route, must be provided with regular passports by the French authorities on request by the Imperial Authorities.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ARTICLE FIVE
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Import and export trade will be permitted to French merchants or French protégés and to Chinese merchants on the land frontier between China and Tonkin.  It must be carried out, however, at certain points which will be determined later and the choice as well as the number will be in agreement with the direction of flow as well as the importance of the traffic of the two countries.  The regulations in force in the interior of the Chinese Empire will be taken into account in this respect.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Two trading posts will be designated on the Chinese frontier, one above Lào Cai and the other above Lạng Sơn.  French merchants may establish themselves there under the same conditions and with the same advantages as in the treaty ports.  The Government of His Majesty the Emperor of China will set up customs posts there, and the Government of the Republic will be able to maintain consuls there with the same privileges and prerogatives accorded to similar agents in the treaty ports.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
His Majesty the Emperor of China may appoint consuls in the principal towns of Tonkin, subject to the agreement of the French Government.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ARTICLE SIX
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A special regulation, annexed to the present treaty, will specify the conditions in which will be carried out the land commerce between Tonkin and the Chinese provinces of Yunnan, Kwangsi and Kwangtung.  That regulation will be prepared by commissioners who will be named by the High Contracting Parties within three months of the signing of the present treaty.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The merchandise which will be the object of this commerce will be subject to, on entering and leaving Tonkin and the provinces of Yunnan and Kwangsi, the same duties as those stipulated for foreign commerce.  However, the reduced tariff will not be applied to merchandise transported across the land frontier between Tonkin and Kwangtung and will not have effect in the ports opened by the treaties.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Trade in arms, machinery, provisions and munitions of war of all kinds will be subject to the laws and regulations laid down by each of the contracting states on its territory.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The export and import of opium will be regulated by special arrangements which will be part of the above mentioned commercial regulations.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The sea trade between China and Annam will be equally the object of a special regulation, provided that it contains no deviations from common practice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ARTICLE SEVEN
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In view of the development of conditions advantageous for commercial relations and neighbourliness which the present treaty has for its object to reestablish between France and China, the Government of the Republic will construct roads in Tonkin and will encourage the construction of railways there.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When, on her side, China decides to construct railway tracks, it is intended that she will address herself to French industry, and the Government of the Republic will provide her with every facility for the procurement in France of the personnel that she needs.  It is also intended that this clause will not be considered as constituting an exclusive privilege in favour of France.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ARTICLE EIGHT
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The commercial stipulations of the present treaty and the regulations arising from them can be revised after an interval of ten years has elapsed, dating from the exchange of ratifications of the present treaty.  But, in the case where, six months before the appointed time, neither one nor the other of the High Contracting Parties has manifested a desire to proceed with revision, the commercial stipulations will remain in force for a new period of ten years and so forth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ARTICLE NINE
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After the present treaty has been signed, French forces will receive the order to retire from Keelung and to cease visitation, etc., on the high seas.  Within one month after the signature of the present treaty, the Island of Formosa and the Pescadores will be entirely evacuated by French troops.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
ARTICLE TEN
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The provisions of older treaties, accords and conventions between France and China, not modified by the present treaty, remain in full force.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The present treaty will be ratified first by His Majesty the Emperor of China, and after that it will be ratified by the President of the French Republic, the exchange of ratifications to take place at Peking after the shortest possible delay.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Done at Tientsin in four examples, 9 June 1885, corresponding to the 27th day of the fourth month of the eleventh year of Kuang-Hsü.&lt;ref&gt;Chere, 193–9&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Restoration of diplomatic relations ==
The signing of the treaty on 9 June was followed by a banquet at which the two plentipotentiaries expressed their satisfaction with the results of the negotiations.  Patenôtre spoke as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have every confidence that the diplomatic agreement we have just signed will do more than just put an end to our past disputes and—I hope—speedily efface them from our memory.  By creating new links between France and China, by opening new markets for the commercial activity of all nations, the Treaty of 9 June will indubitably help to entrench and develop between the Chinese Empire and foreign countries that community of interests which has always most effectively cemented friendships between peoples.  If the imperial government holds the same sentiments in this respect as the government of the Republic, this treaty will confer real and lasting benefits on everyone.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Li Hung-chang made the following reply:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We Chinese have a saying: 'Friendship shines as brightly as the sun.'  This proverb applies particularly to the bonds that link two great countries. China also desires the general welfare and wellbeing.  From now on, the friendship between our two countries will shine as brightly as the morning sun when it emerges from the gloom of night.&lt;ref&gt;Lung Chang, 369&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Implementation of the treaty ==
[[Image:French cavalry en route to Lang Son.jpg|thumb|right|300px|French cavalry troopers prepare to reoccupy Lạng Sơn, October 1885]]
On 10 June 1885, immediately after the signature of the peace treaty, the French lifted their naval blockade of the Yangtze River, Chen-hai and Pak-hoi.  They evacuated Keelung on 21 June 1885 and the Pescadores Islands on 22 July 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Thomazi, 265&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratifications of the Treaty of Tientsin were exchanged at Peking on 28 November 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Rouil, page number to be supplied&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 3 of the treaty provided for the appointment of a Sino-French commission to demarcate the border between Tonkin and China.  China's commissioners were Chou Te-jun (周德潤), Hung Lu-ssu (鴻臚寺) and Ch'ing Teng-ch'eng (卿鄧承).  The French commission was led by M. Bourcier Saint-Chaffray, and its  members included M. Scherzer, the French consul in Canton, Dr Paul Neis, a noted Indochina explorer, Lieutenant-Colonel Tisseyre, Captain Bouinais, and M. Pallu de la Barrière (though the latter took no part in the commission's work).  In preparation for the commission's work General de Courcy despatched French troops to occupy Lạng Sơn, That Khe and other border towns in October 1885.

Demarcation work began in late 1885 and was completed in 1887.  The French rejected Chinese claims to the Vietnamese town of Dong Dang, close to the Guangxi border and the site of a [[Battle of Đồng Đăng (1885)|French victory]] during the Sino-French War, but agreed that the Pak-lung peninsula (白龍尾) on the western border of Guangdong province should be awarded to China.  A dispute over two areas on the border between Yunnan province and Tonkin was settled by the award of Meng-suo (猛梭) and Meng-lai (猛賴) to Vietnam and the transfer of a large tract of fertile arable land between Ma-pai-kuan (馬白關) and Nan-tan-shan (南丹山) to China.  An agreement confirming the new border between Vietnam and China was signed in Peking on 26 June 1887 by French and Chinese representatives.&lt;ref&gt;Lung Chang, 377–8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
The peace treaty of 9 June 1885 formalised France's victory in the Sino-French War.  Although the French were obliged to evacuate Keelung and the Pescadores Islands (which [[Admiral Courbet]] had wanted to retain as a French counterweight to the British colony of Hong Kong), the Chinese withdrawal from Tonkin left the way clear for the French to reoccupy Lạng Sơn and to advance up the Red River to Lào Cai on the Yunnan-Tonkin border.  In the years that followed the French crushed a vigorous Vietnamese resistance movement and consolidated their hold on Annam and Tonkin.  In 1887, [[Cochinchina]], [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin]] (the territories which comprise the modern state of Vietnam) and [[Cambodia]] were incorporated into [[French Indochina]].  They were joined a few years later by [[Laos]], ceded to France by Siam at the conclusion of the [[Franco-Siamese War of 1893]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7801">{{Insolvency}}
An '''unfair preference''' (or "voidable preference") is a legal term arising in [[bankruptcy law]] where a person or [[company (law)|company]] transfers [[assets]] or pays a debt to a [[creditor]] shortly before going into [[bankruptcy]], that payment or transfer can be set aside on the application of the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] or [[trustee in bankruptcy]] as an '''unfair preference''' or simply a preference.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, section 239 of the Insolvency Act 1986 of the [[United Kingdom]], which uses the term 'Preference' rather than 'Unfair Preference'; section 565 of the Corporations Act 2001 of [[Australia]][http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/]; and Sec. 547 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law on unfair preferences varies from country to country, but characteristically, to set a transaction or payment aside as an unfair preference, the liquidator will need to show that:
#the person or company was [[insolvent]] at the time the payment was made (either on the ''cash-flow'' test, or on the ''balance sheet'' test - it varies from country to country)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Simkovic|first = Michael|date = 2016-05-05|editor-last = Adler|editor-first = Barry|title = Making Fraudulent Transfer Law More Predictable|ssrn = 2775920|series = Handbook on Bankruptcy|location =|publisher = Edward Elgar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#the person or company then went into bankruptcy within a specified time thereafter, usually referred to as the ''vulnerability period''&lt;ref&gt;Most jurisdictions apply a variable vulnerability period, for example, in some countries the vulnerability period is 6 months normally, or 2 years of the creditor is a "connected person" such as a family relative, or a company in the same group.&lt;/ref&gt;
#the payment had the effect of putting the creditor in a better position than other [[unsecured creditor]]s
#in some jurisdictions, it is also necessary to show that the bankrupt ''intended'' to grant a preference.&lt;ref&gt;This is the position in the United Kingdom (although section 239(6) says that a preferential payment in favour of a connected person gives rise to a presumption of an intention to prefer), but in Australia and in the U.S., it is not necessary to show an intention to prefer&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, an application to have a transaction set aside as a preference can only be made by the liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy, as the person making the payment must be in bankruptcy, and thus they are not normally liable to lawsuits from other creditors.

The effect of a successful application to have a transaction declared as an unfair preference varies. Inevitably, the creditor which received the payment or assets has to return it to the liquidator. In some countries, the assets are treated in the normal way, and may be taken by any [[secured creditor]]s who have a [[security interest]] which catches the assets (characteristically, a [[floating charge]]).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd'' (1997) BCC 282, now superseded by legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some countries have "ring-fenced" recoveries of unfair preferences so that they are made available to the pool of assets for [[unsecured creditor]]s.

An unfair preference has some of the same characteristics as a [[fraudulent conveyance]],&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but legally they are separate concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Most notably, the fraudulent transfer always reduces the net worth of the transferor while the preference does not. Also, it is not necessarily for the paying party to go into bankruptcy in order to have a transaction which is a fraudulent conveyance set aside in most legal systems, and most legal systems do not require intention to defraud in order to establish an unfair preference.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is not normally any requirement to prove an intention to defraud to recover assets under an unfair preference application. However, similar to fraudulent conveyance applications, unfair preferences are often seen in connection with [[asset protection]] schemes that are entered into too late by the putative bankrupt.

Many jurisdictions provide for an exception in the case of transactions entered into in the [[ordinary course of business]] with a view to keeping the company trading, and such transactions are usually either validated or presumed to be validated.

==In individual jurisdictions==

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|UK insolvency law}}
*[[Insolvency Act 1986]] section 239
*''[[Re MC Bacon Ltd (No 1)]]''

===United States===
A '''preference''' in [[Bankruptcy in the United States|U.S. federal bankruptcy law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|11|101}} ''[[et seq.]]'', known as the Bankruptcy Code&lt;/ref&gt; is a transfer of property by a debtor to its creditor, on account of a pre-existing debt, that is made while the debtor is insolvent&lt;ref&gt;Under the Bankruptcy Code, insolvency exists when the sum of the debtor's debts exceeds the fair value of the debtor's property, with some exceptions. It is a balance sheet test. Chapter 11 United States Code Sec. 101(32)&lt;/ref&gt; and gives the creditor more than it would obtain in a liquidation of the debtor's assets in a [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] proceeding. It is primarily a creature of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|11|547}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some states have similar state laws. If the preferential transaction takes place within a specified period of time before the filing of bankruptcy by or on behalf of the debtor, then the debtor's trustee in bankruptcy is authorized to recover the property preferentially transferred. The mechanism of recovery is the avoidance of the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 11 United States Code Secs. 547(b) and 551&lt;/ref&gt; After such avoidance, the recovered property becomes property of the bankruptcy estate.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', Sec. 551&lt;/ref&gt; The period is usually 90 days. However, if the preferential transfer is made to an "insider," then the period is one year. An "insider" is generally a relative or one who has the ability to control the activities of the debtor.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 11 United States Code Sec. 101(31)&lt;/ref&gt; The Bankruptcy Code provides some exemptions from these rules to accommodate transfers intended to be contemporaneous, made in the ordinary course of business or to the extent they are made for new value, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 11 United States Code Sec. 547(c)&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the following examples assume that the requirements for a preference that are set out above exist at the time the transfer is made.

*Securing a previously unsecured debt.
*Substituting property of greater value as security for existing security property whose value is insufficient to completely secure repayment of the debt.
*Paying some but not all unsecured creditors.
*In a real estate transaction, delaying the recording of a mortgage for more than 30 days after the debt it secures is created.&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Code Section 547(e) provides that in real estate transactions, transfers take place at the time when they are made if they are perfected within 30 days thereafter. Otherwise, the transfer is deemed by the law to be made when it is actually perfected. With respect to mortgages, perfection usually requires the [[recording (real estate)|recording]] of the mortgage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{main|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}
Under Swiss law, creditors who hold a certificate of unpaid debts against the debtor, or creditors in a bankruptcy, may file suit against third parties who have benefited from unfair preferences or [[fraudulent transfer]]s by the debtor prior to a seizure of assets or a [[bankruptcy]].

'''VAGA''' is an artists’ rights organization and copyright collective, representing over 6,000 visual artists worldwide.

==Mission==

Founded in 1976, it was the first fine art and photography royalty collecting society in the United States, and continues to be one of the largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aeqai.com/main/2012/05/vaga-protecting-the-rights-of-artists-since-1976-the-%E2%80%98skinny%E2%80%9D-on-vaga/|title=VAGA: Protecting the rights of artists since 1976|last=Daniel|first=Shawn|publisher=AEQAI|date=17 May 2012|website=AEQAI}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modeled after [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] (The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers), VAGA acts as a clearinghouse for licensing reproduction rights to publishers, museums, film production companies, auction houses, galleries, multinational corporations, and other users of art. In addition, VAGA protects its members from infringements, advises on all aspects of intellectual property law, and advocates for artists’ rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlawreport.com/2013/10/18/lauren-clay-the-donald-smith-estate-david-dodde-and-fair-use-are-we-learning-anything/|title=Lauren Clay, the David Smith Estate, David Dodde, and Fair Use: Are We Learning Anything?|last=O'Donnell|first=Nicholas|publisher=Art Law Report|date=18 October 2013|website=Art Law Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipi.org/2014/07/lehman-submits-statement-for-the-record-for-house-judiciary-hearing-on-moral-rights-termination-rights-resale-royalty-and-copyright-term/|title=Lehman Submits Statement for the Record for House Judiciary Hearing on Moral Rights, Termination Rights, Resale Royalty and Copyright Term|publisher=International Intellectual Property Institute|date=15 July 2014|website=IIPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; VAGA represents artists worldwide, both directly and through agreements with affiliated organizations in other countries. As a member of [[Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d´Auteurs et Compositeurs|CISAC]], the international confederation of societies that represent creators, VAGA takes part in establishing the international standards that govern the use of copyrighted works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisac.org/CisacPortal/page.do?name=rubrique.6.1|title=International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers|website=CISAC|access-date=2014-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713065905/http://www.cisac.org/CisacPortal/page.do?name=rubrique.6.1|archive-date=2014-07-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy and Lobbying ==
VAGA works to improve artists’ rights through consultation with the U.S. Copyright Office and by lobbying Congress for improved rights legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2011/11/vaga-plans-federal-resale-royalties-bill-as-artists-and-auction-houses-battle/|title=VAGA Will Lobby for Federal Resale Royalties Bill|last=Russeth|first=Andrew|publisher=Observer|date=2 November 2011|website=Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VAGA, along with other rights organizations, recently initiated the introduction of the American Royalties Too (ART) Act. The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. [[Jerrold Nadler]] and in the Senate by Senators [[Tammy Baldwin]] and [[Ed Markey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlawreport.com/2014/03/24/resale-royalties-redux-the-american-royalties-too-act/|title=Resale Royalties Redux: the "American Royalties Too Act"|last=O'Donnell|first=Nicholas|publisher=Art Law Report|date=24 March 2014|website=Art Law Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; If enacted, the bill will establish a resale royalty, whereby the creator of a work would receive a percentage of the sale of that work when it is resold at auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2045|title=S.2045 - 113th Congress (2013-2014): American Royalties Too Act of 2014|publisher=Library of Congress|date=26 February 2014|website=congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] reviewed the viability of a resale royalty law in the U.S. VAGA submitted public comments in support of such a law, and addressed the concerns of critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/comments/77fr58175/VAGA.pdf|title=Notice of Inquiry Concerning the Resale Royalty Right: Written Comments of VAGA|last=Panzer|first=Robert|publisher=United States Copyright Office|date=19 September 2012|website=copyright.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; VAGA's Executive Director, Robert Panzer, also participated in roundtable discussions hosted by the U.S. Copyright Office in order to advocate for a resale royalty law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/resaleroyalty/usco-resaleroyalty.pdf|title=Resale Royalties: An Updated Analysis|publisher=United States Copyright Office|date=December 2013|website=copyright.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of the Office’s review were determinedly in favor of a resale royalty law in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/98268/copyright-laws-are-a-changin-in-nyc-and/|title=Copyright Laws Are a-Changin' (Maybe) in the US and EU|last=Heddaya|first=Mostafa|publisher=Hyperallergic|date=13 December 2013|website=Hyperallergic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JungleTac's Sport '''Vii''' ({{zh|s=威力棒|p=Wēilì bàng}}; lit. "Power Stick" or "The Power is Great") is a [[Shanzhai]] [[video game]] [[video game console|console]] similar in aspect to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cn.engadget.com/2007/10/13/engadget-vii-vs-wii-first-shot/ 瘾科技Engadget独家报道：Vii火拼Wii] {{Zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally released in [[China]] in 2007. The Vii was not intended to be a [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh-generation console]] like the Wii, and was instead part of the [[dedicated console]] genre of inexpensive consoles with built-in games. It is based on the 16-bit Sunplus SPG CPU.

The Vii's Puppy Rod 威力棒 controller is similar in size and design to the [[Wii Remote]]. It features motion detection but not the pointing capability of the Wii Remote. The Vii Power Rods also come in "Arctic White", "Hot Pink" and "Mint Blue".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/Vii-Machine-Comes-in-Different-Colours-Gameplay-Screenshots-Out-68411.shtml Vii - Machine Comes in Different Colours. Gameplay Screenshots Out]&lt;/ref&gt;

A redesign of the console, colloquially called the [[Vii 2]] by bloggers, features remodeled controllers and a console design reminiscent of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the [[PlayStation 3]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2007/12/13/keepin-it-real-fake-part-xcx-the-vii-2/ Keepin it real fake, part CI: the [[Vii 2]] - Engadget]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as support for both [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] televisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gonintendo.com/?p=31734 Megaton - Vii 2 has NTSC/PAL support!]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Vii was released in [[Japan]] under the name V Sports (Sport Vii).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wii.qj.net/The-Vii-rises-in-Japan-as-V-Sports/pg/49/aid/117099 The Vii rises in Japan as V-Sports] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405193644/http://wii.qj.net/The-Vii-rises-in-Japan-as-V-Sports/pg/49/aid/117099 |date=April 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Vii itself appears to no longer be in production, JungleTac produced games for at least three other similar plug-and-play consoles, the [[Zone 60]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Zone 60 |medium=Video game console|publisher=Ultimate Products Ltd. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://124.193.201.195/cpcc/RRegisterAction.do?method=list&amp;no=fck&amp;sql_name=ZONE%2060IN1游戏软件&amp;sql_regnum=&amp;sql_author=&amp;curPage=1&amp;count=10&amp;sortOrder=&amp;sortLabel= |title= ZONE 60IN1游戏软件 |author= |date=14 October 2010 |work=计算机软件著作权登记公告 |publisher=Copyright Protection Center of China |language=Chinese |accessdate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.classification.gov.au/www/cob/find.nsf/5c2433d416948a0bca25759f00820d25/1c2ae463cc89c137ca2578390057f305?OpenDocument |title= ZONE60 Computer Games (Multi Platform) |author= |date=16 February 2011 |work=Classification Website |publisher=Australian Government |language= |accessdate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Wireless 60, and the Wireless Air 60, which has been described as the worst gaming console of all time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qiRCU0SCTs&lt;/ref&gt; Many Vii titles and similar games appear on these consoles. However, these consoles' controllers do not have true motion sensors as the Vii does (with the exception of the Wireless Air 60), so the controls are simplified to the point where any motion just triggers a press of the A button. As a result, many of the games need to use power meters to determine distance or power.

Titles that appear are:

*Bowling
*Fantasy Baseball (renamed Baseball Practice)
*Catch Fish (renamed Fishing)
*Alacrity golf (renamed Golf)
*Come On! (Wireless 60 only, renamed Sea-world)
*Free Craps (Wireless 60 only)
*Bubble Blaster (Zone 60 only, renamed Ball Blaster)
*Brave Kaka (Zone 60 only, renamed Brave Heart)
*Bump Bomb (Zone 60 only, renamed Lady Bugs)
*Bump Jump (Wireless 60 only)
*Fire Fighter
*Hero Legend
*Jewel Master 2
*Lightning Plan
*Magic Jelly (Wireless 60 only)
*Mr. Onion
*Pinball Fish (Wireless 60 only)
*Plumber (Zone 60 only, renamed Plumber Man)
*Rapid Stream
*Squirrel Bobble (Zone 60 only)
*Tiger Rescue (Zone 60 only)

}}The '''Wellington Convention''' (formally, the '''Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets in the South Pacific''') is a 1989 [[multilateral treaty]] whereby states agreed to prohibit the use of fishing [[Drift netting|driftnets]] longer than 2.5 kilometres in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].&lt;ref&gt;The region of the South Pacific is described as the "Convention Area" and is defined in the Convention as "the area lying within 10 degrees North latitude and 50 degrees South latitude and 130 degrees East longitude and 120 degrees West longitude, and shall also include all waters under the fisheries jurisdiction of any Party to this Convention".&lt;/ref&gt; The Wellington Convention played a role in the 1991 [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|resolution]] calling for a global moratorium of driftnet fishing on the [[high seas]].

==Creation, signatures, and ratifications==
The Convention was concluded at [[Wellington]] on 24 November 1989. It was opened for signature to states which have territory within the South Pacific. The Convention was signed by [[Australia]], [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[France]], [[Kiribati]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Niue]], [[Palau]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tuvalu]], [[United States]], and [[Vanuatu]].&lt;ref name = treatystatus&gt;[http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Treaties-and-International-Law/01-Treaties-for-which-NZ-is-Depositary/0-Prohibition-of-Fishing.php Treaty status].&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the states that signed the Convention, it has not been ratified by France, Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. [[Samoa]], which did not sign the Convention, has acceded to it. Additionally, [[Papua New Guinea]] has notified New Zealand—the depositary state—that the prohibitions of the Convention had been taken into account when Papua New Guinea enacted its Fisheries Act 1994.&lt;ref name = treatystatus/&gt;

==Global moratorium of driftnet fishing==
On 20 December 1991, the UN General Assembly passed the Resolution on Large-scale Pelagic Driftnet Fishing and its Impact on the Living Marine Resources of the World’s Oceans and Seas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/46/a46r215 General Assembly Resolution 46/215], UN Doc A/RES/46/215.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution called for a worldwide moratorium on driftnet fishing and cited the entry into force of the Wellington Convention as contributing support to such a moratorium.

==Protocols==
The Convention has two Protocols that supplement it. Both were concluded at [[Noumea]], [[New Caledonia]] on 20 October 2000

Ratification of Protocol I allows states that do not have territory in the Convention Area to nevertheless agree that they will prohibit their nationals and their fishing vessels from using driftnets while fishing in the Convention Area. Protocol I has been ratified only by the United States; it entered into force for the U.S. on 28 February 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Treaties-and-International-Law/01-Treaties-for-which-NZ-is-Depositary/0-Prohibition-of-Fishing-1.php Protocol I status].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratification of Protocol II allows states that do not have territory in the Convention Area but have territory in the waters that are contiguous to the Convention Area to nevertheless agree that they will prohibit their nationals and their fishing vessels from using driftnets while fishing in the Convention Area. Protocol II has been ratified by [[Chile]] (5 October 1993) and [[Canada]] (28 August 1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Treaties-and-International-Law/01-Treaties-for-which-NZ-is-Depositary/0-Prohibition-of-Fishing-2.php Protocol II status].&lt;/ref&gt;
