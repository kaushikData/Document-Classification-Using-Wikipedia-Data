'''Auditory processing disorder''' ('''APD'''), also known as '''central auditory processing disorder''' ('''CAPD'''), is an umbrella term for a variety of disorders that affect the way the brain processes [[Sound|auditory]] information.&lt;ref name="AAA, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Academy of Audiology|title=Clinical Practice Guidelines: Diagnosis, Treatment and Management of Children and Adults with Central Auditory|url=http://audiology-web.s3.amazonaws.com/migrated/CAPD%20Guidelines%208-2010.pdf_539952af956c79.73897613.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with APD usually have normal structure and function of the outer, middle, and inner ear (peripheral hearing). However, they cannot process the information they hear in the same way as others do, which leads to difficulties in recognizing and interpreting sounds, especially the sounds composing speech. It is thought that these difficulties arise from dysfunction in the [[central nervous system]].

The American Academy of Audiology notes that APD is diagnosed by difficulties in one or more auditory processes known to reflect the function of the central auditory nervous system.&lt;ref name="AAA, 2010" /&gt;

APD can affect both children and adults, although the actual prevalence is currently unknown. It has been suggested that males are twice as likely to be affected by the disorder as females,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/hcs/resources/capd/capd/index.html |title=(C)APD|author= La Trobe University |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Musiek |first1=Frank |authorlink1= |last2=Gail |first2=Chermak |authorlink2= |title=Handbook of central auditory processing disorder |trans-title=auditory neuroscience and diagnosis |year= 2007|publisher= Plural Publishing|isbn= 1-59756-056-1|pages= 448}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are no good epidemiological studies.

==Presentation ==
CAPD can continue into adulthood. Cooper and Gates (1991) estimated the prevalence of adult APD to be 10 to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;(Cooper JC Jr., Gates GA. Hearing in the elderly – the Framingham cohort, 1983–1985: Part II.  Prevalence of central auditory processing disorders.

===Relation to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===

It has been discovered that APD and [[ADHD]] present overlapping symptoms. Below is a ranked order of behavioral symptoms that are most frequently observed in each disorder. Professionals evaluated the overlap of symptoms between the two disorders. The order below is of symptoms that are almost always observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chermak|first1=Gail D.|last2=Somers|first2=Erin K.|last3=Seikel|first3=J. Anthony|title=Behavioral signs of central auditory processing disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|journal=Journal of American Academy of Audiology|date=1998|page=78-84}}&lt;/ref&gt; This chart proves that although the symptoms listed are different, it is easy to get confused between many of them.

There is a high rate of co-occurrence between AD/HD and CAPD. An article published in 1994 showed that 84% of children with APD have confirmed or suspected ADHD. Co-occurrence between ADHD and APD is 41% for children with confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, and 43% for children suspected of having ADHD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RICCIO|first1=CYNTHIA A.|last2=HYND|first2=GEORGE W.|last3=COHEN|first3=MORRIS J.|last4=HALL|first4=JOSH|last5=MOLT|first5=LAWRENCE|title=Comorbidity of Central Auditory Processing Disorder and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|date=July 1994|volume=33|issue=6|pages=849–857|doi=10.1097/00004583-199407000-00011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''more recently published data is needed to support or refute this statement.'' 
===Relation to specific language impairment and developmental dyslexia===

There has been considerable debate over the relationship between APD and [[Specific language impairment|Specific language impairment (SLI)]].

SLI is diagnosed when a child has difficulties with understanding or producing spoken language for no obvious cause. The problems cannot be explained in terms of peripheral hearing loss. The child is typically late in starting to talk, and may have problems in producing speech sounds clearly, and in producing or understanding complex sentences. Some theoretical accounts of SLI regard it as the result of auditory processing problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=C. A.|year=2011|title= Auditory processing theories of language disorders: Past, present, and future.|journal=Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools|volume=42|issue=3|pages=309–319|doi= 10.1044/0161-1461(2011/10-0040)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1= M. A.|last2=Hall|first2=R. L.|last3= Riley|first3=A|last4= Moore|first4= D. R.|year=2011|title=Communication, listening, cognitive and speech perception skills in children with auditory processing disorder (APD) or specific language impairment (SLI)|journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research|volume= 54|issue=1|pages=211–227| doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2010/09-0167)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view of SLI is not universally accepted, and others regard the main difficulties in SLI as stemming from problems with higher-level aspects of language processing. Where a child has both auditory and language problems, it can be hard to sort out cause-and-effect.&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"/&gt;

Similarly with [[dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]], there has been considerable interest in the idea that for some children reading problems are downstream consequences of difficulties in rapid auditory processing. Again, cause and effect can be hard to unravel. This is one reason why experts such as Moore&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt; have recommended using non-verbal auditory tests to diagnose APD. Specifically regarding the neurological factors of dyslexia, the disorder has been linked to [[polymicrogyria]] which causes cell migrational problems. This relates to APD because children that have polymicrogyri almost always present deficits on APD testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chermak|first1=Gail|last2=Musiek|first2=Frank|title=Handbook of central auditory processing disorder. comprehensive intervention|date=2014|publisher=Plural Publishing|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-1-59756-562-2|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that APD may be related to [[cluttering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pindzola, Rebekah H. |author2=Haynes, William O. |author3=Moran, Michael J. |title=Communication disorders in the classroom: an introduction for professionals in school setting |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=Boston |year=2006 |pages=251 |isbn=0-7637-2743-1 |oclc=59401841 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fluency disorder marked by word and phrase repetitions.

It has been found that a higher than expected proportion of individuals diagnosed with SLI and dyslexia on the basis of language and reading tests also perform poorly on tests in which APD is tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=David R.|title=Auditory processing disorders: Acquisition and treatment|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=July 2007|volume=40|issue=4|pages=295–304|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2007.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; APD can be assessed using tests that involve identifying, repeating or discriminating speech, and a child may do poorly because of primary language problems.&lt;ref name='Dawes &amp; Bishop(2009)'/&gt; In a study comparing children with a diagnosis of dyslexia and those with a diagnosis of APD, they found the two groups could not be distinguished.&lt;ref name="Ferguson, 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dawes|first1=P|last2=Bishop|first2= D|year=2010|title=Psychometric profile of children with auditory processing disorder (APD) and children with dyslexia|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=95|pages=432–436|doi=10.1136/adc.2009.170118|pmid=20501538|pmc=3576918}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller|first1= C.A.|last2=Wagstaff|first2=D.A.|year=2011 |title=Behavioral profiles associated with auditory processing disorder and specific language impairment.|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=44|issue=6|pages=745–763 |doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2011.04.001|pmc=3174343}}&lt;/ref&gt; obtained similar findings in studies comparing children diagnosed with SLI or APD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corriveau K, Pasquini E, Goswami U |title=Basic auditory processing skills and specific language impairment: a new look at an old hypothesis |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=647–66 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17538107 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2007/046) |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dlouha O, Novak A, Vokral J |title=Central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) in children with specific language impairment (SLI). Central auditory tests |journal=Int. J. Pediatr. Otorhinolaryngol. |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=903–7 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17382411 |doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2007.02.012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups had very similar profiles. This raises the worrying possibility that the diagnosis that a child receives may be largely a function of the specialist they see: the same child who would be diagnosed with APD by an audiologist may be diagnosed with SLI by a speech-language therapist or with dyslexia by a psychologist.&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt;

==Causes==

===Acquired auditory processing disorder===
Acquired APD can be caused by any damage to or dysfunction of the central auditory nervous system and can cause auditory processing problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Musiek FE, Chermak GD, Weihing J, Zappulla M, Nagle S |title=Diagnostic accuracy of established central auditory processing test batteries in patients with documented brain lesions |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=342–58 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21864472 |doi=10.3766/jaaa.22.6.4 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lew HL, Weihing J, Myers PJ, Pogoda TK, Goodrich GL |title=Dual sensory impairment (DSI) in traumatic brain injury (TBI)--An emerging interdisciplinary challenge |journal=NeuroRehabilitation |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=213–22 |year=2010 |pmid=20448311 |doi=10.3233/NRE-2010-0557 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an overview of neurological aspects of APD, see Griffiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=T. D.|year=2002|title=Central auditory pathologies. |journal=British Medical Bulletin|volume=63|issue=1|pages=107–120| doi=10.1093/bmb/63.1.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hereditary and genetic characteristics of central auditory processing disorder===
The ability to listen to and comprehend multiple messages at the same time is a trait that is heavily influenced by our genes say federal researchers.&lt;ref&gt;("Genetics Influence Auditory Processing." Psych Central.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Dec. 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt; These "short circuits in the wiring" sometimes run in families or result from a difficult birth, just like any learning disability.&lt;ref&gt;(NCLD.org – NCLD." National Center for Learning Disabilities | NCLD.org.)&lt;/ref&gt; Auditory processing disorder can be associated with conditions affected by genetic traits, such as various developmental disorders. Inheritance of Auditory Processing Disorder refers to whether the condition is inherited from your parents or "runs" in families.&lt;ref&gt;("Inheritance and Genetics of Auditory Processing Disorder." – RightDiagnosis.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Dec. 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Central auditory processing disorder may be hereditary neurological traits from the mother or the father.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Developmental auditory processing disorder===
In the majority of cases of developmental APD, the cause is unknown. An exception is acquired epileptic [[aphasia]] or [[Landau-Kleffner syndrome]], where a child's development regresses, with language comprehension severely affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fandiño M, Connolly M, Usher L, Palm S, Kozak FK |title=Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a rare auditory processing disorder series of cases and review of the literature |journal=Int. J. Pediatr.

In other cases, suspected or known causes of APD in children include delay in [[myelin]] maturation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Weihing, Jeff |author2=Musiek, Frank |chapter=15 Dichotic Interaural Intensity Difference (DIID) |title=Auditory Processing Disorders: Assessment, Management and Treatment |editors=Ross-Swain, Deborah; Geffner, Donna S; |publisher=Plural Publishing Inc |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-59756-107-X |oclc=255602759 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ectopic (misplaced) cells in the [[auditory cortex|auditory cortical]] areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boscariol M, Garcia VL, Guimarães CA |title=Auditory processing disorder in perisylvian syndrome |journal=Brain Dev. |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=299–304 |date=April 2010 |pmid=19410403 |doi=10.1016/j.braindev.2009.04.002 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or genetic predisposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bamiou DE, Campbell NG, Musiek FE |title=Auditory and verbal working memory deficits in a child with congenital aniridia due to a PAX6 mutation |journal=Int J Audiol |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=196–202 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17454233 |doi=10.1080/14992020601175952 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a family with [[autosomal dominant]] [[epilepsy]], [[seizures]] which affected the left temporal lobe seemed to cause problems with auditory processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisano T, Marini C, Brovedani P, Brizzolara D, Pruna D, Mei D, Moro F, Cianchetti C, Guerrini R |title=Abnormal phonologic processing in familial lateral temporal lobe epilepsy due to a new LGI1 mutation |journal=Epilepsia |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=118–23 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15660777 |doi=10.1111/j.0013-9580.2005.26304.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another extended family with a high rate of APD, genetic analysis showed a [[haplotype]] in [[chromosome 12]] that fully co-segregated with language impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Addis L, Friederici AD, Kotz SA, Sabisch B, Barry J, Richter N, Ludwig AA, Rübsamen R, Albert FW, Pääbo S, Newbury DF, Monaco AP |title=A locus for an auditory processing deficit and language impairment in an extended pedigree maps to 12p13.31-q14.3 |journal=Genes, Brain, and Behavior |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=545–61 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20345892 |pmc=2948670 |doi=10.1111/j.1601-183X.2010.00583.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] begins [[in utero]], but the [[central auditory system]] continues to develop for at least the first decade.&lt;ref name="Moore, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moore DR |title=Auditory development and the role of experience |journal=British Medical Bulletin |volume=63 |issue= |pages=171–81 |year=2002 |pmid=12324392 |doi= 10.1093/bmb/63.1.171|url=http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12324392}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable interest in the idea that disruption to hearing during a sensitive period may have long-term consequences for auditory development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thai-Van H, Veuillet E, Norena A, Guiraud J, Collet L |title=Plasticity of tonotopic maps in humans: influence of hearing loss, hearing aids and cochlear implants |journal=Acta Otolaryngol. |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=333–7 |date=March 2010 |pmid=19845491 |doi=10.3109/00016480903258024 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed thalamocortical connectivity [[in vitro]] was associated with a time sensitive developmental window and required a specific [[cell adhesion molecule]] (lcam5) for proper [[brain plasticity]] to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barkat TR, Polley DB, Hensch TK |title=A critical period for auditory thalamocortical connectivity |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=1189–94 |date=September 2011 |pmid=21804538 |doi=10.1038/nn.2882 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.2882 |pmc=3419581}}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to connectivity between the [[thalamus]] and [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] shortly after being able to hear (in vitro) as at least one critical period for auditory processing. Another study showed that rats reared in a single tone environment during critical periods of development had permanently impaired auditory processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Han YK, Köver H, Insanally MN, Semerdjian JH, Bao S |title=Early experience impairs perceptual discrimination |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=1191–7 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17660815 |doi=10.1038/nn1941 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Bad’ auditory experiences, such as temporary deafness by [[cochlea]]r removal in rats leads to neuron shrinkage.&lt;ref name="Moore, 2002"/&gt; In a study looking at attention in APD patients, children with one ear blocked developed a strong right-ear advantage but were not able to modulate that advantage during directed-attention tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Asbjørnsen A, Holmefjord A, Reisaeter S, Møller P, Klausen O, Prytz B, Boliek C, Obrzut JE |title=Lasting auditory attention impairment after persistent middle ear infections: a dichotic listening study |journal=Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=481–6 |date=July 2000 |pmid=10972421 |doi= 10.1111/j.1469-8749.2000.tb00352.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0012-1622&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=42&amp;issue=7&amp;spage=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, there was considerable interest in the role of chronic [[Otitis media]] (middle ear disease or 'glue ear') in causing APD and related language and literacy problems. Otitis media with effusion is a very common childhood disease that causes a fluctuating conductive hearing loss, and there was concern this may disrupt auditory development if it occurred during a sensitive period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whitton JP, Polley DB |title=Evaluating the perceptual and pathophysiological consequences of auditory deprivation in early postnatal life: a comparison of basic and clinical studies |journal=J.

== Questionnaires for identifying or documenting listening problems. ==
Questionnaires can be used for the identification persons with possible auditory processing disorders, as these address common problems of listening. They can help in the decision for pursuing clinical evaluation. One of the most common listening problems is speech recognition in the presence of background noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jerger |first1=James |last2=Musiek |first2=Frank |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children. |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology |date=October 2000 |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467-74 |pmid=11057730 |url=https://www.audiology.org/sites/default/files/journal/JAAA_11_09_01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asha.org/policy/PS2005-00114/|author1=Working Group on Auditory Processing Disorders |website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|title=(Central) Auditory Processing Disorders—The Role of the Audiologist [Position Statement] |date=2005 |doi=10.1044/policy.PS2005-00114}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the respondents who participated in a study by Neijenhuis, de Wit, and Luinge (2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neijenhuis |first1=Karin |last2=de Wit |first2=Ellen |last3=Luinge |first3=Margreet |title=Perspectives of Dutch health professionals regarding auditory processing disorders; a focus group study |journal=International Journal of Audiology |date=13 July 2017 |volume=56 |issue=12 |pages=942–950 |doi=10.1080/14992027.2017.1347290 |pmid=28701055}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following symptoms are characteristic in children with listening difficulties, and they are typically problematic with adolescents and adults. They include:

* Difficulty hearing in noise
* Auditory attention problems
* Better understanding in one on one situations
* Difficulties in noise localization
* Difficulties in remembering oral information

According to the New Zealand Guidelines on Auditory Processing Disorders (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Keith, W.J., Purdy, S.C., Baily, M., Kay, Flora.  Draft of New Zealand APD Guidelines on Auditory Processing Disorder (2018) Published by the Auditory Processing Disorders Reference Group, New Zealand Audiological Society.  &lt;/ref&gt; a checklist of key symptoms of APD or comorbidities that can be used to identify individuals who should be referred for audiological and APD assessment includes, among others:

* Difficulty following spoken directions unless they are brief and simple
* Difficulty attending to and remembering spoken information
* Slowness in processing spoken information
* Difficulty understanding in the presence of other sounds
*Overwhelmed by complex or “busy” auditory environments e.g. classrooms, shopping malls
*Poor listening skills
* Insensitivity to tone of voice or other nuances of speech
*Acquired brain injury
*History of frequent or persistent middle ear disease (otitis media, ‘glue ear’).
*Difficulty with language, reading or spelling
*Suspicion or diagnosis of dyslexia
*Suspicion or diagnosis of language disorder or delay

Finally, the New Zealand guidelines state that behavioral checklists and questionnaires should only be used to provide guidance for referrals, for information gathering (for example, prior to assessment or as outcome measures for interventions), and as measures to describe the functional impact of auditory processing disorder.  They are not designed for the purpose of diagnosing auditory processing disorders. The New Zealand guidelines indicate that a number of questionnaires have been developed to identify children who might benefit from evaluation of their problems in listening.  Examples of available questionnaires include the Fisher’s Auditory Problems Checklist (1976&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, L. I. (1976). ''Fisher’s Auditory Problems Checklist''. Tampa, FL . The Educational Audiology Association&lt;/ref&gt;), the Children’s Auditory Performance Scale (1998&lt;ref&gt;Smoski, W.J., Brung, M.A.. and Tannahill, J.C., (1998) Children’s Auditory Performance Scale,  Tampa, FL: The Educational Audiology Association&lt;/ref&gt;), the Screening Instrument for Targeting Educational Risk (1989&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, K. (1989). ''SIFTER: Screening instrument for targeting educational risk in children identified by hearing screening or who have known hearing loss''. Tampa, FL The Educational Audiology Association&lt;/ref&gt;), and the Auditory Processing Domains Questionnaire (O’Haraa and Mealings, 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O’Hara |first1=Brian |last2=Mealings |first2=Kiri |title=Developing the auditory processing domains questionnaire (APDQ): a differential screening tool for auditory processing disorder |journal=International Journal of Audiology |date=31 July 2018 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1080/14992027.2018.1487087 |pmid=30063869|url=https://dspace.nal.gov.au/xmlui/handle/123456789/931}}&lt;/ref&gt;) among others. All of the previous questionnaires were designed for children and none are useful for adolescents and adults.   

The University of Cincinnati Auditory Processing Inventory (UCAPI) (Keith, Tektas and Ramsey, 2018&lt;ref&gt;Keith, R.W., Tektas, M., and Ramsay, K. (2018) ''Development of the University of Cincinnati Auditory Processing Inventory for Adolescents and Adults (UCAPI)''''',''' American Academy of Audiology Annual Conference.  April 18-21, 2018, Nashville, TN.  Research Podium Presentation.    &lt;/ref&gt;) was designed for use with adolescents and adults seeking  testing for evaluation of problems with listening and/or to be used following diagnosis of an auditory processing disorder to determine the subject’s status.  Following a model described by Zoppo et al. (2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Del Zoppo|first=C.|last2=Sanchez, L.|last3=Lind, C.|date=2015|title=A long-term follow-up of children and adolescents referred for assessment of auditory processing disorder.|url=|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=54|pages=368-375|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) a 34-item questionnaire was developed that investigates auditory processing abilities in each of the six common areas of complaint in APD (listening and concentration, understanding speech, following spoken instructions, attention, and other.)  The final questionnaire was standardized on normally achieving young adults ranging from 18 to 27 years of age.  Validation data was acquired from subjects with language-learning or auditory processing disorders who were either self-reported or confirmed by diagnostic testing.  A UCAPI  total score is calculated by combining the totals from the six listening conditions and provides an overall value to categorize listening abilities. Additionally, analysis of the scores from the six listening conditions provides an auditory profile for the subject. Each listening condition can then be utilized by the professional in making recommendation for diagnosing problem of learning through listening and treatment decisions.  The UCAPI provides information on listening problems in various populations that can aid examiners in making recommendations for assessment and management.

==Diagnosis==
APD is a difficult disorder to detect and diagnose. The subjective symptoms that lead to an evaluation for APD include an intermittent inability to process verbal information, leading the person to guess to fill in the processing gaps. There may also be disproportionate problems with decoding speech in noisy environments.

APD has been defined anatomically in terms of the integrity of the auditory areas of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rintelmann | first1 = W.F. | title = Assessment of central auditory dysfunction : foundations and clinical correlates | chapter = Monaural speech tests in the detection of central auditory disorders. | editors = Marilyn L Pinheiro and Frank E Musiek | publisher = Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 1985 | location = Baltimore  | pages = 173–200 | isbn = 978-0-683-06887-0 | oclc= 11497885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children with symptoms of APD typically have no evidence of neurological disease and the diagnosis is made on the basis of performance on behavioral auditory tests. Auditory processing is "what we do with what we hear",&lt;ref name='Katz 1992'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Katz | first1 = Jack  | title = Central auditory processing : a transdisciplinary view  | chapter = Classification of auditory processing disorders | editors = Jack Katz and Nancy Austin Stecker and Donald Henderson  | publisher = Mosby Year Book | year = 1992 | location = St. Louis | pages = 81–92 | isbn = 978-1-55664-372-9| oclc= 25877287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in APD there is a mismatch between peripheral hearing ability (which is typically normal) and ability to interpret or discriminate sounds. Thus in those with no signs of neurological impairment, APD is diagnosed on the basis of auditory tests. There is, however, no consensus as to which tests should be used for diagnosis, as evidenced by the succession of task force reports that have appeared in recent years. The first of these occurred in 1996.&lt;ref name=cap1996/&gt; This was followed by a conference organized by the American Academy of Audiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Musiek F |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467–74 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11057730 |doi= |url=http://www.taracentar.hr/download/diagnosis_apd_school.pdf |format=pdf }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts attempting to define diagnostic criteria have to grapple with the problem that a child may do poorly on an auditory test for reasons other than poor auditory perception: for instance, failure could be due to inattention, difficulty in coping with task demands, or limited language ability. In an attempt to rule out at least some of these factors, the American Academy of Audiology conference explicitly advocated that for APD to be diagnosed, the child must have a modality-specific problem, i.e. affecting auditory but not visual processing. However, an ASHA committee subsequently rejected modality-specificity as a defining characteristic of auditory processing disorders.&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'/&gt;

In 2011, the British Society of Audiology published 'best practice guidelines'.&lt;ref name='BSA2011'&gt;{{cite web | author=British Society of Audiology | title=British Society of Audiology Best Practice Guidelines. | year=2011 | url=http://thebsa.org.uk/images/stories/docs/BSA_APD_Management_1Aug11_FINAL_amended17Oct11.pdf }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditory processing disorder can be developmental or acquired. It may result from ear infections, head injuries or neurodevelopmental delays that affect processing of auditory information. This can include problems with: "...[[sound localization]] and lateralization (see also [[binaural fusion]]); auditory discrimination; auditory pattern recognition; temporal aspects of audition, including temporal integration, temporal discrimination (e.g., temporal gap detection), temporal ordering, and [[temporal masking]]; auditory performance in competing acoustic signals (including [[dichotic listening]]); and auditory performance with degraded acoustic signals".&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'&gt;{{cite web |title      = (Central) Auditory Processing Disorders.

The Committee of UK Medical Professionals Steering the UK Auditory Processing Disorder Research Program have developed the following working definition of Auditory Processing Disorder: "APD results from impaired neural function and is characterized by poor recognition, discrimination, separation, grouping, localization, or ordering of speech sounds. It does not solely result from a deficit in general attention, language or other cognitive processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebsa.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=29 |title= The British Society of Audiology and the UK APD Steering Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types of testing===
1. The SCAN-C&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Robert W.|date=2000|title=SCAN-C Test for Auditory Processing Dis- orders in Children|journal=Revised, Psychological Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; for children and SCAN-A&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keith|first=Robert|date=2009|title=SCAN-3:A Tests for Auditory Processing Disorders in Adolescents and Adults.|url=https://www.pearson.com/us/|journal=|publisher=Pearson US|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for adolescents and adults are the most common tool for screening and diagnosing APD in the USA.   Both tests are standardized on a large number of subjects and include validation data on subjects with auditory processing disorders.   The test batteries include screening tests: norm-based criterion-referenced scores; diagnostic tests: scaled scores, percentile ranks and ear advantage scores for all tests except the Gap Detection test.  The four tests include four subsets on which the subject scores are derived include: discrimination of monaurally presented single words against background noise (speech in noise), acoustically degraded single words (filtered words), dichotically presented single words and sentences. 

2. Random Gap Detection Test (RGDT) is also a standardized test. It assesses an individual’s gap detection threshold of tones and white noise. The exam includes stimuli at four different frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz) and white noise clicks of 50 ms duration. It is a useful test because it provides an index of auditory temporal resolution. In children, an overall gap detection threshold greater than 20 ms means they have failed and may have an auditory processing disorder based on abnormal perception of sound in the time domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muluk|first=Nuray Bayar|last2=Yalçınkaya|first2=Fulya|last3=Keith|first3=Robert W.|date=February 2011|title=Random gap detection test and random gap detection test-expanded: Results in children with previous language delay in early childhood|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0385814610001446|journal=Auris Nasus Larynx|volume=38|issue=1|pages=6–13|doi=10.1016/j.anl.2010.05.007|issn=0385-8146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=Robert W.|title=Random gap detection test|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Gaps in Noise Test (GIN) also measures temporal resolution by testing the patient's gap detection threshold in white noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musiek|first1=Frank E.|last2=Shinn|first2=Jennifer B.|last3=Jirsa|first3=Robert|last4=Bamiou|first4=Doris-Eva|last5=Baran|first5=Jane A.|last6=Zaida|first6=Elena|title=GIN (Gaps-In-Noise) Test Performance in Subjects with Confirmed Central Auditory Nervous System Involvement|journal=Ear and Hearing|date=December 2005|volume=26|issue=6|pages=608–618|doi=10.1097/01.aud.0000188069.80699.41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. Pitch Patterns Sequence Test (PPT) and Duration Patterns Sequence Test (DPT) measure auditory pattern identification. The PPS has s series of three tones presented at either of two pitches (high or low). Meanwhile, the DPS has a series of three tones that vary in duration rather than pitch (long or short). Patients are then asked to describe the pattern of pitches presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musiek|first1=Frank|title=Frequency (Pitch) and Duration Pattern Tests|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology|date=1994|page=265-268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modality-specificity and controversies===

The issue of modality-specificity has led to considerable debate among experts in this field.  Cacace and McFarland have argued that APD should be defined as a ''modality-specific'' perceptual dysfunction that is not due to peripheral hearing loss.&lt;ref name='Cacace McFarland 1995'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Opening Pandora's Box: The Reliability of CAPD Tests | journal = American Journal of Audiology | date = July 1995 | first = Anthony T. | last = Cacace | author2 = Dennis J.

It is also impractical, as audiologists do not have access to standardized tests that are visual analogs of auditory tests. The debate over this issue remains unresolved. It is clear, however, that a modality-specific approach will diagnose fewer children with APD than a modality-general one, and that the latter approach runs a risk of including children who fail auditory tests for reasons other than poor auditory processing. Although modality-specific testing has been advocated for well over a decade, to date no tests have been published which would allow audiologists to perform a modality-specific evaluation (i.e., no clinical versions of visual analogs to auditory processing tests exist).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Another controversy concerns the fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials.&lt;ref name="D.R.Moore (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=David R.|year=2006|title=Auditory processing disorder (APD): Definition, diagnosis, neural basis, and intervention|journal=Audiological Medicine|volume=4|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1080/16513860600568573}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2010-08-31--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The British Society of Audiology&lt;ref name='BSA2011'/&gt; has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of ''non-speech sounds''.&lt;ref name='D.R.Moore (2006)'/&gt; The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.

In recent years there have been additional criticisms of some popular tests for diagnosis of APD. Tests that use tape-recorded American English have been shown to over-identify APD in speakers of other forms of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The SCAN-C in testing for auditory processing disorder in a sample of British children.|first1=P|last1=Dawes |first2=D.V. M.|last2=Bishop|year=2007|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=46|pages=780–786|doi=10.1080/14992020701545906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance on a battery of non-verbal auditory tests devised by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]'s Institute of Hearing Research was found to be heavily influenced by non-sensory task demands, and indices of APD had low reliability when this was controlled for.&lt;ref name='Moore2010'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nature of auditory processing disorder in children.|first1=D.R.|last1=Moore|first2=M.A.|last2=Ferguson|first3=A.M.|last3=Edmondson-Jones|first4=S|last4=Ratib|first5=A|last5=Riley|year=2010|journal=Pediatrics|volume=126|issue=2|pages=e382-390|doi=10.1542/peds.2009-2826}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Moore2011'&gt;{{cite journal|title= Development of auditory processing in 6-11 year old children.|first1=D.R.|last1=Moore|first2=J.A.|last2=Cowan|first3=A|last3=Riley|first4=A.M.|last4=Edmondson-Jones|first5= M.A.|last5=Ferguson|year=2011|journal=Ear and Hearing|volume=32|issue=3|pages=269–285|doi=10.1097/AUD.0b013e318201c468}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research undermines the validity of APD as a distinct entity in its own right and suggests that the use of the term "disorder" itself is unwarranted. In a recent review of such diagnostic issues, it was recommended that children with suspected auditory processing impairments receive a holistic psychometric assessment including general intellectual ability, auditory memory, and attention, phonological processing, language, and literacy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title= Controversies in central auditory processing disorder |veditors=Cacace AT, McFarland DJ |chapter= Putting the Auditory Processing Back into Auditory Processing Disorder in Children |vauthors=Cowan J, Rosen S, Moore DR |pages=187–197 |year=2009 |publisher= San Diego, Calif.; Abingdon: Plural. |isbn=978-159-756260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors state that "a clearer understanding of the relative contributions of perceptual and non-sensory, unimodal and supramodal factors to performance on psychoacoustic tests may well be the key to unravelling the clinical presentation of these individuals."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Depending on how it is defined, APD may share common symptoms with [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD/ADHD]], [[specific language impairment]], and [[autism spectrum]] disorders. A review showed substantial evidence for atypical processing of auditory information in children with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Connor K |title=Auditory processing in autism spectrum disorder: A review |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume= 36|issue= 2|pages= 836–54|date=December 2011 |pmid=22155284 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.11.008 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawes and Bishop noted how specialists in audiology and speech-language pathology often adopted different approaches to child assessment, and they concluded their review as follows: "We regard it as crucial that these different professional groups work together in carrying out assessment, treatment and management of children and undertaking cross-disciplinary research."&lt;ref name='Dawes &amp; Bishop(2009)'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dawes P, Bishop D |title=Auditory processing disorder in relation to developmental disorders of language, communication and attention: a review and critique |journal=Int J Lang Commun Disord |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=440–65 |year=2009 |pmid=19925352 |doi=10.1080/13682820902929073 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, this seems rare.

To ensure that APD is correctly diagnosed, the examiners must differentiate APD from other disorders with similar symptoms. Factors that should be taken into account during the diagnosis are: attention, [[auditory neuropathy]], fatigue, hearing and sensitivity, intellectual and developmental age, medications, motivation, motor skills, native language and language experience, response strategies and decision-making style, and [[visual acuity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jerger|first1=James|last2=Musick|first2=Frank|title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology|date=2000|volume=11|issue=9|pages=467–474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that children under the age of seven cannot be evaluated correctly because their language and auditory processes are still developing. In addition, the presence of APD cannot be evaluated when a child's primary language is not English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brandstaetter|first1=Patt|last2=Hunter|first2=Lisa|last3=Kalweit|first3=Linda|last4=Kloos|first4=Eric|last5=Landrud|first5=Sherry|last6=Larson|first6=Nancy|last7=Packer|first7=Amy|last8=Wall|first8=Deb|title=Introduction to Auditory Processing Disorders|journal=Minnesota Department of Education Total Special Education System|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APD can manifest as problems determining the direction of sounds, difficulty perceiving differences between speech sounds and the sequencing of these sounds into meaningful words, confusing similar sounds such as "hat" with "bat", "there" with "where", etc.  Fewer words may be perceived than were actually said, as there can be problems detecting the gaps between words, creating the sense that someone is speaking unfamiliar or nonsense words. In addition, it is common for APD to cause speech errors involving the distortion and substitution of consonant sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeVore|first1=Brooke|last2=Nagao|first2=Kyoko|last3=Pereira|first3=Olivia|last4=Nemith|first4=Julianne|last5=Sklar|first5=Rachele|last6=Deeves|first6=Emily|last7=Kish|first7=Emily|last8=Welsh|first8=Kelsey|last9=Morlet|first9=Thierry|title=Speech errors among children with auditory processing disorder|journal=Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics|date=2016|volume=29|issue=1|page=6|doi=10.1121/2.0000440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those suffering from APD may have problems relating what has been said with its meaning, despite obvious recognition that a word has been said, as well as repetition of the word.  Background noise, such as the sound of a radio, television or a noisy bar can make it difficult to impossible to understand speech, since spoken words may sound distorted either into irrelevant words or words that don't exist, depending on the severity of the auditory processing disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson S, Kraus N |title=Sensory-cognitive interaction in the neural encoding of speech in noise: a review |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=575–85 |date=October 2010 |pmid=21241645 |pmc=3075209 |doi=10.3766/jaaa.21.9.3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a telephone can be problematic for someone with auditory processing disorder, in comparison with someone with normal auditory processing, due to low quality audio, poor signal, intermittent sounds and the chopping of words.&lt;ref name='ASHA 2005'/&gt; Many who have auditory processing disorder subconsciously develop visual coping strategies, such as lip reading, reading body language, and eye contact, to compensate for their auditory deficit, and these coping strategies are not available when using a telephone.

As noted above, the status of APD as a distinct disorder has been queried, especially by speech-language pathologists&lt;ref name='Kamhi2011'&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.G.|last=Kamhi|year=2011|title= What speech-language pathologists need to know about Auditory Processing Disorder.|journal=Language Speech and Hearing Services in Schools|volume= 42|issue=3|pages=265–272|doi=10.1044/0161-1461(2010/10-0004)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and psychologists,&lt;ref name='Lovett2011'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovett|first=B.J.|year=2011|title=Auditory processing disorder: School psychologist beware?|journal=Psychology in the Schools|volume=48|pages=855–867|doi=10.1002/pits.20595}}&lt;/ref&gt; who note the overlap between clinical profiles of children diagnosed with APD and those with other forms of specific learning disability. Many audiologists, however, would dispute that APD is just an alternative label for dyslexia, SLI, or ADHD, noting that although it often co-occurs with these conditions, it can be found in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Hearing Journal|year=

==Remediation and training==

{{See also|Alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities}}

Treatment of APD typically focuses on three primary areas: changing learning environment, developing higher-order skills to compensate for the disorder, and remediation of the auditory deficit itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellis|first1=Teri James|title=Auditory Processing Disorders (APD) in Children|url=https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Understanding-Auditory-Processing-Disorders-in-Children/|website=www.asha.org|publisher=ASHA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a lack of well-conducted evaluations of intervention using [[randomized controlled trial]] methodology. Most evidence for effectiveness adopts weaker standards of evidence, such as showing that performance improves after training. This does not control for possible influences of practice, maturation, or placebo effects. Recent research has shown that practice with basic auditory processing tasks (i.e. auditory training) may improve performance on auditory processing measures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chermak GD, Silva ME, Nye J, Hasbrouck J, Musiek FE |title=An update on professional education and clinical practices in central auditory processing |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=428–52; quiz 455 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17715652 |doi= 10.3766/jaaa.18.5.7|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MooreDR2007 &gt;{{cite journal |author=Moore DR |title=Auditory processing disorders: acquisition and treatment |journal=J Commun Disord |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=295–304 |year=2007 |pmid=17467002 |doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2007.03.005 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and phonemic awareness measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moore DR, Rosenberg JF, Coleman JS |title=Discrimination training of phonemic contrasts enhances phonological processing in mainstream school children |journal=Brain Lang |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=72–85 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15896385 |doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2004.11.009 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes after auditory training have also been recorded at the physiological level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russo NM, Nicol TG, Zecker SG, Hayes EA, Kraus N |title=Auditory training improves neural timing in the human brainstem |journal=Behav.

Treating additional issues related to APD can result in success. For example, treatment for phonological disorders (difficulty in speech) can result in success in terms of both the phonological disorder as well as APD. In one study, speech therapy improved auditory [[evoked potential]]s (a measure of brain activity in the auditory portions of the brain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leite RA, Wertzner HF, Matas CG |title=Long latency auditory evoked potentials in children with phonological disorder |journal=Pró-fono : Revista De Atualização Científica |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=561–6 |year=2010 |pmid=21271117 |doi= 10.1590/s0104-56872010000400034|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0104-56872010000400034&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is evidence that language training is effective for improving APD, there is no current research supporting the following APD treatments:
* [[Auditory Integration Training]] typically involves a child attending two 30-minute sessions per day for ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities|veditors=Jacobson JW, Foxx RM, Mulick JA |chapter= Auditory integration training: a critical review|vauthors=Mudford OC, Cullen C |pages=351–62|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-8058-4192-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lindamood-Bell Learning Processes (particularly, the Visualizing and Verbalizing program)
* Physical activities that require frequent crossing of the midline (e.g., [[occupational therapy]])
* Sound Field Amplification
* Neuro-Sensory Educational Therapy
*Neurofeedback

However, use of a FM transmitter has been shown to produce significant improvements over time with children.

==History==
The first research into APD began in 1954 with Helmer Myklebust's study, "Auditory Disorders in Children".&lt;ref&gt;Myklebust, H. (1954). Auditory disorders in children. New York: Grune &amp; Stratton.&lt;/ref&gt; Myklebust's work suggested auditory processing disorder was separate from [[language]] learning difficulties. His work sparked interest in auditory deficits after acquired brain lesions affecting the temporal lobes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocca E, Calearo C, Cassinari V |title=A new method for testing hearing in temporal lobe tumours; preliminary report |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=219–21 |year=1954 |pmid=13197002 |doi= 10.3109/00016485409128700|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocca E, Calearo C, Cassinari V, Migliavacca F |title=Testing "cortical" hearing in temporal lobe tumours |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=289–304 |year=1955 |pmid=13275293 |doi= 10.3109/00016485509124282|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and led to additional work looking at the physiological basis of auditory processing,&lt;ref name="Kimura1961"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimura|first1=Doreen|title=Cerebral dominance and the perception of verbal stimuli.|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology |

In 1977, the first conference on the topic of APD was organized by Robert W. Keith, Ph.D. at the University of Cincinnati.  The proceedings of that conference was published by Grune and Stratton under the title "Central Auditory Dysfunction" (Keith RW Ed.)  That conference started a new series of studies focusing on APD in children.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J., &amp; Illmer, R. (1972). Auditory perception in children with learning disabilities. In J. Katz (Ed.), Handbook of clinical audiology (pp. 540–563).

These early researchers also invented many of the auditory training approaches, including interhemispheric transfer training and interaural intensity difference training. This period gave us a rough understanding of the causes and possible treatment options for APD.
Much of the work in the late nineties and 2000s has been looking to refining testing, developing more sophisticated treatment options, and looking for genetic risk factors for APD. Scientists have worked on improving behavioral tests of auditory function, [[neuroimaging]], [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic]], and [[electrophysiologic]] testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Thibodeau L, Martin J |title=Behavioral and electrophysiologic evidence of auditory processing disorder: a twin study |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=438–60 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12371661 |doi= |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Estes RI, Jerger J, Jacobson G |title=Reversal of hemispheric asymmetry on auditory tasks in children who are poor listeners |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=59–71 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11895008 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with new technology has led to a number of software programs for auditory training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chermak GD, Musiek FE |title=Auditory training: Principles and approaches for remediation and managing auditory processing disorders |journal=Seminars in Hearing  |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=287–295  |year=2002 |ISSN=0734-0451 |pmid= |doi=10.1055/s-2002-35878 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Musiek F |title=Habilitation and management of auditory processing disorders: overview of selected procedures |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=329–42 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10385875 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With global awareness of mental disorders and increasing understanding of [[neuroscience]], auditory processing is more in the public and academic consciousness than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Task Force on Central Auditory Processing Consensus Development |title=Central auditory processing: Current status of research and implications for clinical practice  [Technical Report] |journal=American Journal of Audiology |volume=5 |issue= |pages=41–54 |year=1996 |doi=10.1044/policy.TR1996-00241 |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/TR1996-00241.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004220836/http://www.asha.org/docs/html/TR1996-00241.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jerger J, Musiek F |title=Report of the Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis of Auditory Processing Disorders in School-Aged Children |journal=J Am Acad Audiol |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=467–74 |format=pdf |date=October 2000 |pmid=11057730 |doi= |url=http://www.bsnpta.org/geeklog/public_html/filemgmt/filemgmt_data/files/Auditory_Processing_Disorders_in_Children.pdf |access-date=2012-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621224822/http://www.bsnpta.org/geeklog/public_html/filemgmt/filemgmt_data/files/Auditory_Processing_Disorders_in_Children.pdf |archive-date=2013-06-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Keith, Robert W. |title=Central auditory and language disorders in children |publisher=College-Hill Press |location=San Diego, CA |year=1981 |pages= |isbn=0-933014-74-0 |oclc=9258682 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Katz, Jack |author2=Henderson, Donald |author3=Stecker, Nancy Austin |title=Central auditory processing: a transdisciplinary view |publisher=Mosby Year Book |location=St. Louis, MO |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=1-55664-372-1 |oclc= 2587728 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Katz, Jack |author2=Stecker, Nancy Austin |title=Central auditory processing disorders: mostly management |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-205-27361-0 |oclc=246378171 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
The term '''study circle''' has become common terminology in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] to describe a specific type of gathering for the study of the [[Bahá'í teachings]], with an emphasis on "promoting the well-being of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;The introduction to 'Reflections on the Life of the Spirit' states that the Institute's purpose is "to use the courses as means of serving the Cause and promoting the well-being of humanity." (p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Study circles are a form of [[distance learning]] designed to systematically bring education about spiritual concepts to the grassroots level.  Because they are intended to be sustainable and reproducible on a large scale, study circles shy away from formally taught classes, opting instead for participatory methods.  They are usually led by a tutor whose role is not to act as an expert but rather to facilitate the rhythm and pace of the study circle.  In this way, attendees of study circles are expected to become active participants in their own learning process.

Another foundational principle of study circles is a heavy emphasis on the [[:Category:Bahá'í texts|Bahá'í writings]] as a means of finding unity of vision and action by focusing on the essentials of Bahá'í belief.

At the present time, the most common curriculum used in study circles is one that was originally developed at the [[Ruhi Institute]] in [[Colombia]] but is now used in Bahá'í communities all over the world.  Because of its origin, most [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] refer to this curriculum as the Ruhi sequence or Ruhi materials.  Additional courses used by study circles vary from country to country and include the "Fundamental Verities" and "Core Curriculum" materials developed in the United States, among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6860">'''Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory''' is a [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]]-owned research and development facility in the [[Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[West Mifflin, Pennsylvania]], that works exclusively on the design and development of [[nuclear power]] for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. It was one of the leaders in creating the [[nuclear navy]].

The laboratory, which is part of the [[Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program]], a joint U.S Navy-[[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] program responsible for the research, design, construction, operation and maintenance of U.S. nuclear-powered warships is operated by Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corporation.

The laboratory was founded in 1949 on the site of the former [[Bettis Field]], named after [[Cyrus Bettis]]. It covers approximately {{convert|207|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/reg3wcmd/ca/pa/pdf/pa0890090004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From the Lab's founding until 1998, it was run by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]. [[Bechtel Corporation]] won the contract to run the laboratory on September 19, 2008 and assumed operation on February 1, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bechtel.com/2008-09-19.html Bechtel Corporation: Bechtel Awarded Contracts for Bettis, Knolls Laboratories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; first under its subsidiary Bechtel Bettis, Inc., later under Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corporation.

The laboratory developed [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge National Laboratory's]] original design of the [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) for operational naval use. It built the nuclear propulsion plants for the first U.S. nuclear [[submarine]]s and [[surface ship]]s including {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, {{USS|George Washington|SSBN-598|6}}, {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|6}}, and  {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/organizations/history_center/legacies/simpson.html IEEE - IEEE History Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126072439/http://www.ieee.org/organizations/history_center/legacies/simpson.html |date=November 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westinghouse's Nuclear Power Division adapted the PWR design for commercial use and built the first commercial nuclear power plant in the [[United States]], the [[Shippingport Reactor|Shippingport Power Plant]] in the west hills of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/facility/bettis.htm Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory - United States Nuclear Forces&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The laboratory had two [[supercomputer]]s listed on the 26th [[TOP500]] List (November 2005). Ranked 97 a 1,090 processor [[Opteron]] system and ranked 405 a 536 processor [[Itanium 2]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.top500.org/sublist/Site.php?id%3D427 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110083013/http://top500.org/sublist/Site.php?id=427 |archivedate=2005-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--dead link--&gt;

The laboratory is also home to the U.S. Navy's Bettis Reactor Engineering School. The school provides a post-graduate certificate program in [[Nuclear engineering|Nuclear Engineering]] with a focus on nuclear reactor design, construction, and operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/eng/appndx-c.htm Naval Reactors (NR): A Potential Model for Improved &lt;BR&gt;Personnel Management in the Department of Energy (DOE)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.com/officer/nuclear |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828231328/http://www.navy.com/officer/nuclear |archivedate=2005-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is open only to Naval personnel and Bettis engineers.

The laboratory had been chosen to develop the [[Project Prometheus]] nuclear power source for the JIMO ([[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]]) project, however, funding for this program was cancelled in the fall of 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10185">'''Blood lipids''' (or '''blood fats''') are [[lipids]] in the [[blood]], either free or bound to other [[molecule]]s. They are mostly transported in a [[protein]] capsule, and the density of the lipids and type of protein determines the fate of the particle and its influence on [[metabolism]]. The concentration of blood lipids depends on intake and [[excretion]] from the [[intestine]], and uptake and [[secretion]] from [[biological cell|cells]]. Blood lipids are mainly [[fatty acids]]{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and [[cholesterol]]{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. [[Hyperlipidemia]] is the presence of elevated or abnormal levels of [[lipid]]s and/or [[lipoprotein]]s in the [[blood]], and is a major risk factor for [[cardiovascular disease]].

==Fatty acids==

===Intestine intake===
{{Main|Digestion#Fat digestion|l1=Fat Digestion}}
[[Short chain fatty acids|Short-]] and [[medium chain fatty acids]] are absorbed directly into the blood via  [http://jcb.rupress.org/content/41/1/33.full.pdf intestine capillaries] and travel through the [[portal vein]]. [[Long-chain fatty acids]], on the other hand, are too large to be directly released into the tiny intestine capillaries. Instead they are coated with [[cholesterol]] and protein (protein coat of [[lipoproteins]]) into a compound called a [[chylomicron]]. The chylomicron enters a [[lymphatic]] capillary and enters into the bloodstream first at the left [[subclavian vein]] (having bypassed the liver).

In any case, the concentration of blood fatty acids increase temporarily after a meal.

===Cell uptake===
After a meal, when the blood concentration of fatty acids rises, there is an increase in uptake of fatty acids in different cells of the body, mainly [[liver cells]], [[adipocytes]] and [[muscle cells]]. This uptake is stimulated by [[insulin]] from the [[pancreas]]. As a result, the blood concentration of fatty acid stabilizes again after a meal.

===Cell secretion===
After a meal, some of the fatty acids taken up by the liver is converted into [[very low density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL) and again secreted into the blood.&lt;ref name=Lodish&gt;Molecular cell biology. Lodish, Harvey F. 5. ed. : - New York : W. H. Freeman and Co., 2003. Page 321. b ill. {{ISBN|0-7167-4366-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, when a long time has passed since the last meal, the concentration of fatty acids in the blood decreases, which triggers [[adipocytes]] to release stored fatty acids into the blood as [[free fatty acids]], in order to supply e.g. muscle cells with energy.

In any case, also the fatty acids secreted from cells are anew taken up by other cells in the body, until entering [[fatty acid metabolism]]{{Clarify|date=September 2008}}.

==Cholesterol==
{{Main|Cholesterol}}
The fate of cholesterol in the blood is highly determined by its constitution of [[lipoproteins]], where some types favour transport towards body tissues and others towards the liver for excretion into the intestines.

The 1987 report of [[National Cholesterol Education Program]], Adult Treatment Panels suggest the total [[blood cholesterol level]] should be: &lt;200&amp;nbsp;mg/dl normal blood cholesterol, 200–239&amp;nbsp;mg/dl borderline-high, &gt;240&amp;nbsp;mg/dl high cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= ,|title=Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults. The Expert Panel |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=36–69 |year=1988 |pmid=3422148 |doi=10.1001/archinte.148.1.36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average amount of ''blood cholesterol'' varies with age, typically rising gradually until one is about 60 years old. There appear to be seasonal variations in cholesterol levels in humans, more, on average, in winter.&lt;ref name=Ockene2004&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ockene IS, Chiriboga DE, Stanek EJ, Harmatz MG, Nicolosi R, Saperia G, Well AD, Freedson P, Merriam PA, Reed G, Ma Y, Matthews CE, Hebert JR |title=Seasonal variation in serum cholesterol levels: treatment implications and possible mechanisms. |journal=Arch Intern Med |volume=164 |pages=863–70 |year=2004 |pmid=15111372 |doi=10.1001/archinte.164.8.863 |issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These seasonal variations seem to be inversely linked to [[vitamin C]] intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Intestine intake===
{{Main|Cholesterol#Synthesis and intake|l1=Synthesis and intake}}
In [[lipid digestion]], cholesterol is packed into [[Chylomicrons]] in the [[small intestine]], which are delivered to the [[Portal vein]] and [[Lymph]].  The chylomicrons are ultimately taken up by liver [[hepatocytes]] via interaction between [[apolipoproteinE]] and the [[LDL receptor]] or [[Lipoprotein receptor-related protein]]s.

===In lipoproteins===
{{Main|Lipoprotein}}
Cholesterol is minimally soluble in [[water]]; it cannot dissolve and travel in the water-based bloodstream. Instead, it is transported in the bloodstream by [[lipoprotein]]s that are water-soluble and carry cholesterol and [[triglyceride]]s internally. The [[apolipoprotein]]s forming the surface of the given lipoprotein particle determine from what cells cholesterol will be removed and to where it will be supplied.

The largest lipoproteins, which primarily transport fats from the [[intestine|intestinal]] [[mucosa]] to the [[liver]], are called [[chylomicron]]s. They carry mostly fats in the form of triglycerides. In the liver, chylomicron particles release triglycerides and some cholesterol. The liver converts unburned food metabolites into [[very low density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL) and secretes them into plasma where they are converted to intermediate density lipoproteins(IDL), which thereafter are converted to [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) particles and non-esterified fatty acids, which can affect other body cells. In healthy individuals, the relatively few LDL particles are large. In contrast, large numbers of small dense LDL (sdLDL) particles are strongly associated with the presence of [[atheroma]]tous disease within the arteries. For this reason, LDL is referred to as "bad cholesterol".

[[High-density lipoprotein]] (HDL) particles transport cholesterol back to the liver for excretion, but vary considerably in their effectiveness for doing this{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. Having large numbers of large HDL particles correlates with better health outcomes, and hence it is commonly called "good cholesterol". In contrast, having small amounts of large HDL particles is independently associated with [[atheroma]]tous disease progression within the arteries.

===Intestine excretion===
After being transported to the liver by HDL, cholesterol is delivered to the intestines via bile production. However, 92-97% is reabsorbed in the intestines and recycled via [[enterohepatic circulation]].

===Cell uptake===
{{Main|Cholesterol#Synthesis and intake|l1=Synthesis and intake}}
Cholesterol circulates in the blood in [[low-density lipoprotein]]s and these are taken into the cell by [[LDL receptor]]-mediated [[endocytosis]] in [[clathrin]]-[[coated pits]], and then hydrolysed in lysosomes.

===Cell secretion===
{{Main|Cholesterol#Synthesis and intake|l1=Synthesis and intake}}
In response to low blood cholesterol, different cells of the body, mainly in the [[liver]] and [[intestines]], start to synthesize cholesterol from [[acetyl-CoA]] by the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. This is then released into the blood.

==Related medical conditions==

===Hyperlipidemia===
{{Main|Hyperlipidemia}}
Hyperlipidemia is the presence of elevated or abnormal levels of [[lipid]]s and/or [[lipoprotein]]s in the [[blood]].

Lipid and [[lipoprotein]] abnormalities are extremely common in the general population, and are regarded as a highly modifiable risk factor for [[cardiovascular disease]]. In addition, some forms may predispose to [[acute pancreatitis]]. One of the most clinically relevant lipid substances is [[cholesterol]], especially on [[atherosclerosis]] and [[cardiovascular disease]]. The presence of high levels of cholesterol in the blood is called [[hypercholesterolemia]].&lt;ref name="pmid12957096"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Durrington P |title=Dyslipidaemia |journal=Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9385 |pages=717–31 |year=2003 |pmid=12957096 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hyperlipoproteinemia]] is elevated levels of [[lipoproteins]].

===Hypercholesterolemia===
{{Main|Hypercholesterolemia}}
Hypercholesterolemia is the presence of high levels of [[cholesterol]] in the blood.&lt;ref name="pmid12957096"/&gt; It is not a [[disease]] but a [[metabolism|metabolic]] derangement that can be secondary to many diseases and can contribute to many forms of disease, most notably [[cardiovascular disease]]. [[Familial hypercholesterolemia]] is a rare [[genetic disorder]] that can occur in families, where sufferers cannot properly metabolise cholesterol.

===Hypocholesterolemia===
Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed ''[[hypocholesterolemia]]''. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, and while some studies suggest a link with [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[cancer]] and [[cerebral hemorrhage]] it is unclear whether the low cholesterol levels are a cause for these conditions or an [[epiphenomenon]] [http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=1208].

'''Cloud engineering''' is the application of [[engineering]] disciplines to [[cloud computing]]. It brings a systematic approach to concerns of commercialization, standardization, and governance of cloud computing applications. In practice, it leverages the methods and tools of engineering in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tony Shan, "Smart Cloud Engineering, Nomenclature, and Enablement", in Proceedings of the 1st International, May 7-9, 2011 |isbn=978-989-8425-52-2 |publisher=SciTePress}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is about the process of designing the systems necessary to leverage the power and economics of cloud resources to solve business problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/cloud-engineering |title=Gartner IT Glossary |year=2013 |accessdate=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core features==
Cloud engineering is a field of engineering that focuses on cloud services, such as "[[software as a service]]", "[[platform as a service]]", and "[[infrastructure as a service]]". It is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as ''[[systems engineering]]'', ''[[software engineering]]'', ''[[web engineering]]'', ''[[performance engineering]]'', ''[[information technology engineering]]'', ''[[security engineering]]'', platform engineering, service engineering, risk engineering, and quality engineering. The nature of commodity-like capabilities delivered by cloud services and the inherent challenges in this business model drive the need for cloud engineering as the core discipline.

Elements of Cloud Engineering include:
* Foundation: the fundamental basics, concepts, guiding principles, and taxonomy
* Implementation: the building blocks and practice guides for Cloud realization
* Lifecycle: the end-to-end iteration of Cloud development and delivery
* Management: the design-time and run-time Cloud management from multiple perspectives

===Profession===

The professionals who work in the field of cloud engineering are primarily cloud architects and engineers. The key skills possessed by cloud engineering professionals are:
* Know the language of business and [[domain knowledge]]
* Understand the conceptual, logical and physical architecture
* Master various cloud technologies, frameworks, and platforms
* Implement the solutions for quality of cloud services, e.g. HA, DR, scaling, performance
* Work on the security at multiple levels
* Develop applications for flexible deployment, provisioning, and management
* Leverage open source packages and products
* Apply agile and lean principles in design and construction

The demand for skills in advanced ICT (Information and Communication Technology) has rapidly expanded in recent years as business and society are being transformed by the emergence of Internet and Web as ubiquitous media for enabling knowledge-based global economy. This in turn has created a huge demand for networked-enabled parallel and distributed computing technologies that are changing the way we conduct science, operate business, and tackle challenging problems such as epidemic diseases and climate change.

==Software==
There are many platforms available for cloud engineering.

==History==
The notion of cloud engineering in the context of cloud computing had been sparsely used in discussions, presentations and talks in various occasions in the middle of the 2000s. The term of cloud engineering was formally coined around 2007 and the concept of cloud engineering was officially introduced in April 2009. Various aspects and topics of this subject have been extensively covered in a number of industry events. Extensive research has been conducted on specific areas in cloud engineering, such as development support for cloud patterns, and cloud business continuity services. The first IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E) took place on March 25–28, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering.leeds.ac.uk/computing/conferences/IC2E2013 |title=1st IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E) |year=2013 |accessdate=March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second conference was held on March 10–14, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://conferences.computer.org/IC2E/2014 |title=2nd IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E) |year=2014 |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Davydov soliton''' is a quantum [[quasiparticle]] representing an excitation propagating along the [[protein]] [[α-helix]] self-trapped [[amide|amide I]].  It is a solution of the Davydov [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. It is named for the Soviet and Ukrainian physicist [[Alexander Davydov]]. The Davydov model describes the interaction of the amide I [[vibration]]s with the [[hydrogen bond]]s that stabilize the [[α-helix]] of [[protein]]s. The elementary excitations within the α-helix are given by the [[phonon]]s which correspond to the deformational oscillations of the lattice, and the [[exciton]]s which describe the internal [[amide|amide I]] excitations of the [[peptide group]]s. Referring to the atomic structure of an α-helix region of protein the mechanism that creates the Davydov soliton ([[polaron]], [[exciton]]) can be described as follows: [[vibration]]al [[energy]] of the [[carbonyl|C=O]] [[stretching]] (or [[amide|amide I]]) [[oscillator]]s that is localized on the α-helix acts through a phonon coupling effect to distort the structure of the α-helix, while the helical distortion reacts again through phonon coupling to trap the amide I oscillation energy and prevent its dispersion. This effect is called ''self-localization'' or ''self-trapping''.&lt;ref name="Davydov1973"&gt;{{cite journal

Davydov's [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is formally similar to the [[Polaron#Polaron theory|Fröhlich-Holstein Hamiltonian]] for the interaction of electrons with a polarizable lattice. Thus the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the [[energy operator]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{H}=\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}+\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}+\hat{H}_{\text{int}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[quasiparticle]] ([[exciton]]) [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which describes the motion of the amide I excitations between adjacent sites; &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phonon]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which describes
the [[vibration]]s of the [[lattice model (physics)|lattice]]; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{int}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[interaction]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which describes the interaction of the amide I excitation with the lattice.&lt;ref name="Davydov1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davydov1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davydov1977"/&gt;

The [[quasiparticle]] ([[exciton]]) [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{qp}}=&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n,\alpha}E_{0}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;-J\sum_{n,\alpha}\left(\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n+1,\alpha}+\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n-1,\alpha}\right)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;+L\sum_{n,\alpha}\left(\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha+1}+\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha-1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the index &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,\cdots,N&lt;/math&gt; counts the peptide groups along the α-helix spine, the index &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1,2,3&lt;/math&gt; counts each α-helix spine, &lt;math&gt;E_{0}=3.28\times10^{-20}&lt;/math&gt; J is the energy of the amide I
vibration (CO stretching), &lt;math&gt;J=1.55\times10^{-22}&lt;/math&gt; J is the [[dipole]]-[[dipole]] coupling energy between a particular amide I bond and those ahead and behind along the same spine, &lt;math&gt;L=2.46\times10^{-22}&lt;/math&gt; J is the
dipole-dipole coupling energy between a particular amide I bond and those on adjacent spines in the same unit cell of the [[protein]] [[α-helix]], &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; are respectively
the [[boson]] [[creation and annihilation operator]] for a quasiparticle at the [[peptide group]]. &lt;math&gt;n,\alpha&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyman1981"&gt;

The [[phonon]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{H}_{\text{ph}}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n,\alpha}\left[w(\hat{u}_{n+1,\alpha}-\hat{u}_{n,\alpha})^{2}+\frac{\hat{p}_{n,\alpha}^{2}}{M}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}_{n,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[displacement operator]] from the equilibrium position of the [[peptide group]] &lt;math&gt;n,\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{p}_{n,\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[momentum operator]] of the [[peptide group]] &lt;math&gt;n,\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, M is the [[mass]] of each [[peptide group]], and &lt;math&gt;w=19.5&lt;/math&gt; N m&lt;math&gt;^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Elasticity (physics)|effective elasticity coefficient]] of the lattice (the [[spring constant]] of a [[hydrogen bond]]).

Finally, the [[interaction]] [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_{\text{int}}&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{H}_{\text{int}}=\chi\sum_{n,\alpha}\left[(\hat{u}_{n+1,\alpha}-\hat{u}_{n,\alpha})\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}^{\dagger}\hat{A}_{n,\alpha}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\chi=-30&lt;/math&gt; pN is an anharmonic parameter arising from the coupling between the [[quasiparticle]] (exciton) and the lattice displacements (phonon) and parameterizes the strength of the [[exciton]]-[[phonon]] [[interaction]]. The value of this parameter for [[α-helix]] has been determined via comparison of the theoretically calculated absorption line shapes with the experimentally measured ones.&lt;ref name="Cruzeiro2005"&gt;

The mathematical techniques that are used to analyze Davydov's soliton are similar to some that have been developed in polaron theory. In this context the Davydov's soliton corresponds to a [[polaron]] that is (i) ''large'' so the continuum limit approximation is justified, (ii) ''acoustic'' because the self-localization arises from interactions
with acoustic modes of the lattice, and (iii) ''weakly coupled'' because the anharmonic energy is small compared with the phonon bandwidth.&lt;ref name="Scott1992"/&gt;

The Davydov soliton is a ''quantum quasiparticle'' and it obeys [[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]. Thus any model that does not impose translational invariance is flawed by construction.&lt;ref name="Scott1992"/&gt; Supposing that the Davydov soliton is localized to 5 turns of the [[α-helix]] results in significant uncertainty in the [[velocity]] of the [[soliton]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta v=133&lt;/math&gt; m/s, a fact that is obscured if one models the Davydov soliton as a classical object.

There are three possible fundamental approaches towards Davydov model:&lt;ref name="Takeno1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruzeiro1997"&gt;
{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (i) the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], in which both the amide I vibration ([[exciton]]s) and the lattice site motion ([[phonon]]s) are treated quantum mechanically; (ii) the mixed quantum-classical theory, in which the amide I vibration is treated quantum mechanically but the lattice is classical; and (iii) the [[classical theory]], in which both the amide I and the lattice motions are treated classically.

In [[music theory]], the '''descending tetrachord''' is a series of four notes from a [[scale (music)|scale]], or [[tetrachord]], arranged in order from highest to lowest, or descending order. For example, &lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|8}}&lt;/sub&gt;-{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|7}}&lt;/sub&gt;-{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|6}}&lt;/sub&gt;- &lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|5}}&lt;/sub&gt;, as created by the [[Andalusian cadence]]. The descending tetrachord may fill a [[perfect fourth]] or a [[chromatic fourth]].

Taking for granted an equal [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|moral status]] as [[person]]s, '''difference feminism''' asserts that there are differences between men and women but that no value judgment can be placed upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/carol-gilligan/|title = Carol Gilligan |website= Psychology's Feminist Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "difference feminism" developed during the "equality-versus-difference debate" in American feminism in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Joan|title=Deconstructing Equality-Versus-Difference: Or, the Uses of Post-structuralist Theory for Feminism|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1988|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.2307/3177997|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently fell out of favor and use. In the 1990s feminists addressed the binary logic of "difference" versus "equality" and moved on from it, notably with postmodern and/or deconstructionist approaches that either dismantled or did not depend on that dichotomy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bock|first1=Gisela|last2=James|first2=Susan|title=Beyond Equality and Difference|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn = 9780415079891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|location = London|isbn = 9781446228043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism did not require a commitment to [[gender essentialism|essentialism]]. Most strains of difference feminism did not argue that there was a biological, inherent, ahistorical, or otherwise "essential" link between womanhood and traditionally feminine values, habits of mind (often called "ways of knowing"&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiebinger|first1=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=2 footnote 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists simply sought to recognize that, in the present, women and men are significantly different and to explore the devalued "feminine" characteristics.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tandon|first1=Neeru|title=Feminism: A Paradigm Shift|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strains of difference feminism, for example [[Mary Daly]]'s, argue not just that women and men were different, and had different values or different ways of knowing, but that women and their values were superior to men's.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This viewpoint does not require essentialism, although there is ongoing debate about whether Daly's feminism is essentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoagland|first1=Sarah Lucia|last2=Frye|first2=Marilyn|title=Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandilands|first1=Catriona|title=The Good-Natured Feminist Ecofeminism and the Quest for Democracy|date=1999|pages=chapter 5: "Cyborgs and Queers"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Difference feminism was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as "[[equality feminism]]"), which emphasized the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasized the differences between men and women and argued that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminism aimed to make society and law gender-neutral, since it saw recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism held that gender-neutrality harmed women "whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism drew on earlier nineteenth-century strains of thought, for example the work of German writer [[Elise Oelsner]], which held that not only should women be allowed into formerly male-only spheres and institutions (e.g. public life, science) but that those institutions should also be expected to change in a way that recognizes the value of traditionally devalued feminine ethics (like care [see [[ethics of care]]]). On the latter point, many feminists have re-read the phrase "difference feminism" in a way that asks "what difference does feminism make?" (e.g. to the practice of science) rather than "what differences are there between men and women"?&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Essentialism and Difference Feminism==
Some have argued that the thought of certain prominent second-wave feminists, like psychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] and radical feminist theologian [[Mary Daly]], is "essentialist." In philosophy essentialism is the belief that "(at least some) objects have (at least some) essential properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accidental vs Essential Properties|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/essential-accidental/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of sexual politics essentialism is taken to mean that "women" and "men" have fixed essences or essential properties (e.g. behavioral or personality traits) that cannot be changed. However, essentialist interpretations of Daly and Gilligan have been questioned by some feminist scholars, who argue that charges of "essentialism" are often used more as terms of abuse than as theoretical critiques based on evidence,&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyes|first1=Cressida J.|title=Anti-Essentialism in Practice: Carol Gilligan and Feminist Philosophy|journal=Hypatia|date=1997|volume=13|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1997.tb00009.x|pages=142–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braidotti|first1=Rosi|title="Essentialism" in Feminism and Psychoanalysis: A Critical Dictionary|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not accurately reflect Gilligan&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; or Daly's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suhonen|first1=Marja|title="Toward Biophilic Be-ing: Mary Daly's Feminist Metaethics and the Question of Essentialism" in Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|date=2000|publisher=Penn State University Press|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; views.

'''Digital civics''' refers a range of [[Ethics|ethical]] and responsible civic behaviours, [[citizenship]], or democratic engagement in the [[Internet|digital realm]]. The term itself is still establishing currency.

== Context ==

Digital civics has arisen from concerns regarding the challenges faced by individuals and society in the digital age. As science and technology have advanced, so too has human understanding of their place in the world. This has altered the way people interact with one another and the broader context in which they exist. Digital civics respond to these challenges by formulating a robust foundation upon which initiatives into digital citizenship and digital citizen engagement can be developed.

== Definitions ==

Researcher Estelle Clements defines digital civics as “the study of the rights and responsibilities of citizens who inhabit the infosphere and access the world digitally.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Clements, who was a doctoral researcher at the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] at the time, first put forward this definition in 2010 as part of an educational project done in conjunction with the [[Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive]]. The goal of their project was to teach about life in the online world.

According to Clements this definition meets three objectives:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# It promotes an understanding of the environment where civic actions take place;
# It acknowledges the information philosophy that underpins this environment;
# It endorses the policy discourse that addresses the basic rights and ethical responsibilities of citizens.

Other conceptions of digital civics are still emerging. [[Newcastle University]] has suggested that Digital Civics is about “Digital technologies and citizen-driven design”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/about/|title=About|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy of information ==

Numerous scholars have suggested that the [[Philosophy of Information]] is the most logical course to underpin policy and project work for life in the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Media Ethics.|last=Ess|first=Charles|publisher=Polity Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|date=2009|title=The Information Society and its Philosophy|url=|journal=The Information Society|volume=25(3)|pages=153–158.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Information Philosopher [[Luciano Floridi]] has played a critical role in the success of such work, particularly in exploration of [[Information society|Information Society]], European Policy, and [[European Commission]]’s Onlife initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319040929|title=The Onlife Manifesto - Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era {{!}} Luciano Floridi|publisher=Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

Clements identifies four underlying pillars that contribute to a robust digital civics as well as four key concepts in which digital civics is grounded.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estelle|first=Clements,|date=2017|title=Digital Civics in Pedagogy: A Response to the Challenges of Digital Convergence in the Educational Environment|url=https://arrow.dit.ie/appadoc/88/|journal=ARROW@DIT|language=en|doi=10.21427/D7J45F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcivics.org/about/|title=What is Digital Civics|last=|first=|date=2018|website=digitalcivics.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underlying pillars of Digital Civics   ===

Philosophy (specifically the [[Philosophy of information|Philosophy of Information]] as described by Luciano Floridi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luciano|first=Floridi|date=2002|title=What is the philosophy of information|url=|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=33|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  
 
History (drawing from [[Media ecology|Media Ecology]] and [[Classics|Classical scholarship]]),

Ethics (particularly [[Virtue ethics|Virtue Ethics]])

Civics (including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], as well as a conjoining of the public and private personas called Hybrid selves&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ess|first=Charles|date=2010|title=The Embodied Self in a Digital Age: Possibilities, Risks, and Prospects for a Pluralistic (democratic/liberal) Future?|url=|journal=Nordicom Information|volume=32(2)|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Key concepts for Digital Civics ===
- It acknowledges the transformations in human life and our world brought about by new scientific breakthroughs and technological developments, and the impact these changes have on how we behave.

- It recognises the importance of responding to these changes in ethical and intellectually rigorous ways.

- And it appreciates that we have a long historical tradition from which to draw when addressing these challenges.

- Fundamental to Digital Civics is an appreciation of the informational nature of reality.

== Contention of digital civics and virtue ethics ==

In considering the ethical issues that arise from digital age civic issues, numerous scholars have suggested that such ethical initiatives should use [[virtue ethics]] as a basis for a shared global [[information ethics]]: namely, Charles Ess,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Ess|date=2010|title=Trust and New Communications Technologies: Vicious Circles, Virtuous Circles, Possible Futures.|url=|journal=Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy|volume=23(3-4)|pages=287–305|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Shannon Vallor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and the Virtues: A philosophical guide to a future worth wanting.|last=Vallor|first=Shannon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Volkman&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volkman|first=Richard|date=2010|title=Why Information Ethics must begin with Virtue Ethics|url=|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=41|pages=380–401|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2010). In her doctoral work on digital civics pedagogy, Clements suggests that her findings were compatible with a framework of virtue ethics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the Information philosopher [[Luciano Floridi]] asserts that a global information ethics cannot be built upon virtue ethics because virtue ethics is “intrinsically egopoeitic”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Information|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Oxford, UK|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus does not take into account responsibilities owed to the surrounding community or environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge handbook of information and computer ethics|last=Floridi|first=Luciano|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, this matter is still contested.

== Educational programs ==

In 2010, the first pedagogical program for digital civics was started by the Oscar Wilde Facebook Laboratory. It was a collaboration between [[Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive]] and the [[Dublin Institute of Technology]]'s, Estelle Clements. A global team of researchers and educators created a multi-platform (online and offline) learning environment to teach students and the public about digital civics. The project formed the basis of Clements’ doctoral work which formulated a Model for Digital Civics in [[Pedagogy]]. At the time, Clements was particularly concerned that new digital citizenship initiatives were not considering the necessary underlying philosophical and ethical issues raised by the digital age and sought to provide a robust foundation to solve this problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014 Newcastle University, launched a program to teach digital civics to postgraduate students at their Open Lab . The program research concentrates on “exploring how digital technologies can empower citizens and communities”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/|title=Digital Civics at Open Lab|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “trains doctoral students in the design, deployment and evaluation of community-driven digital technologies and services.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcivics.io/apply/|title=Centre for Doctoral Training in Digital Civics|website=digitalcivics.io|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[The MacArthur Research Network on Youth and Participatory Politics (YPP) released a digital civics toolkit described as: “a collection of resources for educators to support youth to explore, recognize, and take seriously the civic potentials of digital life.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalcivicstoolkit.org/|title=Digital Civics Toolkit|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toolkit draws heavily from digital media literacy, focusing on 5 modules: Exploring Community Issues, Investigation, Dialogue, Voice, and Action”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[File:Nordkirchen-100415-12272-Trinkender.jpg|thumb|300px|The act of drinking portrayed in statuary—the figure employs a traditional [[waterskin]].]]
'''Drinking''' is the act of [[Ingestion|ingesting]] [[water]] or other [[liquid]]s into the body through the mouth. Water is required for many of life’s physiological processes. Both excessive and inadequate water intake are associated with health problems.

==Methods==

===In humans===
When a [[liquid]] is poured into an open human mouth, the [[swallowing]] process is completed by [[peristalsis]] which delivers the liquid to the stomach; much of the activity is abetted by gravity. The liquid may be poured from the hands or [[drinkware]] may be used as vessels. Drinking can also be performed by acts of [[inhalation]], typically when imbibing hot liquids or drinking from a spoon. Infants employ a method of suction wherein the lips are pressed tight around a source, as in [[breastfeeding]]: a combination of breath and tongue movement creates a vacuum which draws in liquid.&lt;ref name=Flint137&gt;Flint, pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===In aquatic animals===
[[Amphibian]]s and [[aquatic animal]]s which live in [[freshwater]] do not need to drink: they absorb water steadily through the skin by [[osmosis]].&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtis569&gt;Curtis, p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saltwater fish]], however, drink through the mouth as they swim, and purge the excess salt through the gills.&lt;ref name=Curtis569/&gt;

===In land animals===
[[File:Cat_lapping_water_off_ground_in_slow_motion.gk.webm|thumb|Slow motion video of a cat lapping water]]
By necessity, [[terrestrial animal]]s in captivity become accustomed to drinking water, but most free-roaming animals stay hydrated through the fluids and moisture in fresh food.&lt;ref name=Mayer59&gt;Mayer, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; When conditions impel them to drink from bodies of water, the methods and motions differ greatly among species.&lt;ref name=Broom105&gt;Broom, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[desert animals]] do not drink even if water becomes available, but rely on eating [[succulent plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;

Cats, canines, and ruminants all lower the neck and lap in water with their powerful tongues.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt; Cats and canines lap up water with the tongue in a spoon-like shape.&lt;ref name=Smith238&gt;Smith, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruminants and most other herbivores partially submerge the tip of the mouth in order to draw in water by means of a plunging action with the tongue held straight.&lt;ref name=Smith237&gt;Smith, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Cats drink at a significantly slower pace than ruminants, who face greater natural predation hazards.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt; Uniquely, elephants draw water into their trunks and squirt it into their mouths.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;

Most birds scoop or draw water into the [[Buccal cavity|buccal]] areas of their bills, raising and tilting their heads back to drink. An exception is the common pigeon which can suck in water directly by inhalation.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;

==Hydration and dehydration==
[[File:Drinking Bee2.jpg|thumb|Drinking can be observed in many insect species.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;]]
{{Main|Tissue hydration|Dehydration}}
Like nearly all other life forms, humans require water for [[tissue hydration]]. Lack of hydration causes [[thirst]], a desire to drink which is regulated by the [[hypothalamus]] in response to subtle changes in the body's [[electrolyte]] levels and blood volume. A decline in total [[body water]] is called [[dehydration]] and will eventually lead to death by [[hypernatremia]]. Methods used in the [[management of dehydration]] include assisted drinking or [[oral rehydration therapy]].

An overconsumption of water can lead to [[water intoxication]], which can dangerously dilute the concentration of salts in the body. Overhydration sometimes occurs among athletes and outdoor laborers, but it can also be a sign of disease or damage to the hypothalamus. A persistent desire to drink inordinate quantities of water is a psychological condition termed [[polydipsia]]. It is often accompanied by [[polyuria]] and may itself be a symptom of [[Diabetes mellitus]] or [[Diabetes insipidus]].&lt;ref name=Provan120&gt;Provan, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human water requirements===
A daily intake of water is required for the normal physiological functioning of the [[human body]]. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] recommends a daily intake of ''total water'': not necessarily by drinking but by consumption of water contained in other [[beverage]]s and foods. The recommended intake is 3.7 liters (appx. 1 gallon) per day for an adult male, and 2.7 liters (appx. 0.75 gallon) for an adult female.&lt;ref name=USDA2011&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=4&amp;tax_level=3&amp;tax_subject=256&amp;topic_id=1342&amp;level3_id=5140 |title=Dietary Guidance |author=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |work=USDA Food and Nutrition Information Center |accessdate=31 August 2013 |quote=Redirects to the NAS report, [http://www.iom.edu/Global/News%20Announcements/~/media/442A08B899F44DF9AAD083D86164C75B.ashx Dietary Reference Intakes: Electrolytes and Water] (PDF) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429140007/http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=4&amp;tax_level=3&amp;tax_subject=256&amp;topic_id=1342&amp;level3_id=5140 |archivedate=29 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, however, claim that a high intake of fresh [[drinking water]], separate and distinct from other sources of moisture, is necessary for good health – eight servings per day of eight fluid ounces (1.8 liters, or 0.5 gallon) is the amount recommended by many [[nutritionist]]s,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/treatments/healthy_living/nutrition/healthy_water.shtml |title=Healthy living – Water |author=Greenhalgh, Alison |year=2001 |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=BBC Health |accessdate=31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no scientific evidence supporting this recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/283/5/R993 |title=Drink at least eight glasses of water a day: Really?

==Alcoholic beverages==
{{Main|Alcoholic drink}}
The term “drinking” is often used [[Metonymy|metonymically]] for the consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Most cultures throughout history have incorporated some number of the [[List of alcoholic beverages|wide variety of "strong drinks"]] into their meals, celebrations, ceremonies, [[Toast (honor)|toasts]] and other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Gately, pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of fermented drinks in human culture goes back as early as the [[Neolithic]] Period,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Clarence Hodges. ''Alcohol, Culture, and Society''. AMS Press, 1952, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first pictorial evidence can be found in Egypt around 4,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=David|title=Ancient Period|url=http://www2.potsdam.edu/alcohol/Controversies/1114796842.html#.VICKF9xH1FI|website=History of Alcohol and Drinking around the World|publisher=State University of New York|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Alcohol consumption]] has developed into a variety of well-established [[drinking culture]]s around the world. Despite its popularity, alcohol consumption poses significant health risks. [[Alcohol abuse]] and the addiction of [[alcoholism]] are common maladies in developed countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msbgsruprofiles.pdf|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high rate of consumption can also lead to [[cirrhosis]], [[gastritis]], [[gout]], [[pancreatitis]], [[hypertension]], various forms of [[cancer]], and numerous other illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fiebach, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16775">'''Earth systems engineering and management''' (ESEM) is a discipline used to analyze, design, engineer and manage complex [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[system]]s. It entails a wide range of subject areas including [[anthropology]], [[engineering]], [[environmental science]], [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]]. At its core, ESEM looks to "rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion" &lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"&gt;Gorman, Michael. (2004). ''Syllabus Spring Semester 2004''. Retrieved October 29, 2005 from http://repo-nt.tcc.virginia.edu/classes/ESEM/syllabus.html.&lt;/ref&gt; ESEM is a newly emerging area of study that has taken root at the University of Virginia, Cornell and other universities throughout the United States. Founders of Earth Systems Engineering &amp; Management are [[Braden Allenby]] and Michael Gorman.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Michael Gorman is currently a professor at the University of Virginia. He is with the School of Engineering and Applied Science in the department of Science, Technology and Society.  He teaches STS 300, Earth Systems Engineering &amp; Management, STS 401, Western Technology and Culture and STS 402, The Engineer in Society. Dr. Gorman's research interests include experimental simulations of scientific reasoning, described in his book Simulating Science (Indiana UP, 1992) and case studies of ethics, invention and discovery, which are described in his book Transforming Nature (Kluwer, 1998). He is the faculty advisor for a graduate program,  Societal and Ethical Dimensions of Systems Engineering.

In the UK, the [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceser Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research] (CESER) at Newcastle University has a large ESEM programme, led by [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceg/staff/profile/richard.dawson Professor Richard Dawson].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/ceg/staff/profile/richard.dawson Richard Dawson] is Professor of Earth Systems Engineering at Newcastle University and Director of the Centre for Earth Systems Engineering Research.  His work has focused on developing adaptation solutions to ensure of structure and cities are resilient and sustainable in the face of intensifying global change.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction to ESEM==
For centuries now, mankind has been utilizing the earth and its natural resources to advance civilization and develop technology.  "As a principle {{sic}} result of Industrial Revolutions and associated changes in human demographics, technology systems, cultures, and economic systems have been the evolution of an Earth in which the dynamics of major natural systems are increasingly dominated by human activity".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt;

In many ways, ESEM views the earth as a human artifact. "In order to maintain continued stability of both natural and human systems, we need to develop the ability to rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion- an Earth Systems Engineering and Management (ESEM) capability".&lt;ref name = "Gorman, 2004"/&gt; 

Over the past five years, the concept of Earth Systems Engineering and Management has been developed by a few individuals. One of particular note is [[Braden Allenby]].  Allenby holds that the foundation upon which ESEM is built is the notion that “the Earth, as it now exists, is a product of human design”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"&gt;* Allenby, B. R. (2005). Reconstructing earth : Technology and environment in the age of humans. Washington, DC: Island Press. From https://www.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip059/2005006241.html&lt;/ref&gt; In fact there are no longer any natural systems left in the world, “there are no places left on Earth that don’t fall under humanity’s shadow”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2000"&gt;Allenby, B. R. (2000, Winter). Earth systems engineering and management. IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 0278-0079(Winter) 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; “So the question is not, as some might wish, whether we should begin ESEM, because we have been doing it for a long time, albeit unintentionally.

The issue is whether we will assume the ethical responsibility to do ESEM rationally and responsibly”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; Unlike the traditional engineering and management process “which assume a high degree of knowledge and certainty about the systems behavior and a defined endpoint to the process,” ESEM “will be in constant dialog with [the systems], as they – and we and our cultures – change and coevolve together into the future”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; ESEM is a new concept, however there are a number of fields “such as [[industrial ecology]], [[adaptive management]], and [[systems engineering]] that can be relied on to enable rapid progress in developing” ESEM as a discipline.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt;

The premise of ESEM is that science and technology can provide successful and lasting solutions to human-created problems such as environmental pollution and climate-change.  This assumption has recently been challenged in ''Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ESEM, as all technological control and manipulation, causes unintended and inherently unavoidable negative consequences. Furthermore, due to the limitations of reductionist science, it is inherently impossible to predict all negative impacts of ESEM. Consequently, ESEM can be considered a high-risk technological fix, which attempts to address symptoms of the planetary environmental crisis rather than root causes, which are dysfunctional human behavior such as [[human overpopulation]] and [[overconsumption]].

==ESEM: Topics==
=== Adaptive management ===
[[Adaptive management]] is a key aspect of ESEM.  Adaptive management is a way of approaching environmental management.  It assumes that there is a great deal of uncertainty in environmental systems and holds that there is never a final solution to an earth systems problem.  Therefore, once action has been taken, the Earth Systems Engineer will need to be in constant dialogue with the system, watching for changes and how the system evolves. This way of monitoring and managing ecosystems accepts nature's inherent uncertainty and embraces it by never concluding to one certain cure to a problem.

===Earth Systems Engineering===
Earth [[Systems engineering]] is essentially the use of systems analysis methods in the examination of environmental problems.  When analyzing complex environmental systems, there are numerous data sets, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and variables.  It is therefore appropriate to approach such problems with a systems analysis method.  Essentially there are “six major phases of a properly-conducted system study”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"&gt;* Gibson, J. E. (1991). How to do A systems analysis and systems analyst decalog. In W. T. Scherer (Ed.), (Fall 2003 ed.) (pp. 29-238). Department of Systems and Information Engineering: U of Virginia. Retrieved October 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The six phases are as follows:
#Determine Goals of System
#Establish Criteria for Ranking Alternative Candidates
#Develop Alternatives Solutions
#Rank Alternative Candidates
#Iterate
#Action

Part of the systems analysis process includes determining the goals of the system.  The key components of goal development include the development of a Descriptive Scenario, a Normative Scenario and Transitive Scenario.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Essentially, the Descriptive Scenario “describe[s] the situation as it is [and] tell[s] how it got to be that way” (Gibson, 1991).  Another important part of the Descriptive Scenario is how it “point[s] out the good features and the unacceptable elements of the status quo”.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt; Next, the Normative Scenario shows the final outcome or the way the system should operate under ideal conditions once action has been taken.&lt;ref name = "Gibson, 1991"/&gt;  For the Earth Systems approach, the “Normative Scenario” will involve the most complicated analysis.  The Normative Scenario will deal with stakeholders, creating a common trading zone or location for the free exchange of ideas to come up with a solution of where a system may be restored to or just how exactly a system should be modified.  Finally the Transitive scenario comes up with the actual process of changing a system from a Descriptive state to a Normative state.  Often, there is not one final solution, as noted in [[adaptive management]].  Typically an iterative process ensues as variables and inputs change and the system coevolves with the analysis.

===Environmental science===
{{main|Environmental science}}
When examining complex ecologic systems there is an inherent need for the Earth Systems Engineer to have a strong understanding of how natural processes function.  A training in Environmental Science will be crucial to fully understand the possible unintended and undesired effects of a proposed earth systems design.  Such fundamental topics such as the carbon cycle or the [[water cycle]] are pivotal processes that need to be understood.

===Ethics &amp; Sustainability===
At the heart of ESEM is the social, ethical and moral responsibility of the Earth Systems Engineer to stakeholders and to the natural system being engineered, to come up with an objective Transitive and Normative scenario.  “ESEM is the cultural and ethical context itself”.&lt;ref name = "Allenby, 2005"/&gt; The Earth Systems Engineer will be expected to explore the ethical implications of proposed solutions.

“The perspective of environmental sustainability requires that we ask ourselves how each interaction with the natural environment will affect, and be judged by, our children in the future” ”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"&gt;Newton, L. H. (2003). Ethics and sustainability : Sustainable development and the moral life. Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; “There is an increasing awareness that the process of development, left to itself, can cause irreversible damage to the environment, and that the resultant net addition to wealth and human welfare may very well be negative, if not catastrophic”.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt;  With this notion in mind, there is now a new goal of sustainable environment-friendly development.&lt;ref name = "Newton, 2003"/&gt; [[Sustainable development]] is an important part to developing appropriate ESEM solutions to complex environmental problems.

===Industrial ecology===
{{main|Industrial ecology}}
Industrial ecology is the notion that major manufacturing and industrial processes need to shift from open loop systems to closed loop systems. This is essentially the recycling of waste to make new products.  This reduces refuse and increases the effectiveness of resources.  ESEM looks to minimize the impact of industrial processes on the environment, therefore the notion of recycling of industrial products is important to ESEM.

==Case Study: Florida Everglades==
The [[Florida Everglades]] system is a prime example of a complex ecological system that underwent an ESEM analysis.

;Background
The Florida Everglades is located in southern Florida.  The ecosystem is essentially a subtropical fresh water marsh composed of a variety of flora and fauna.&lt;ref name="Everglades, 2004"&gt;“Everglades.” Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. 10 April 2004. {{cite web |url=http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214102114/http://www.evergladesplan.org/ |archivedate=2005-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note is the [[saw grass]] and ridge slough formations that make the Everglades unique.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"&gt;(Davis, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of the past century mankind has had a rising presence in this region.  Currently, all of the eastern shore of Florida is developed and the population has increased to over 6 million residents.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; This increased presence over the years has resulted in the channeling and redirecting of water from its traditional path through the Everglades and into the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean.  With this there have been a variety of deleterious effects upon the Florida Everglades.

;Descriptive Scenario
By 1993, the Everglades had been affected by numerous human developments.  The water flow and quality had been affected by the construction of canals and levees, to the series of elevated highways running through the Everglades to the expansive Everglades Agricultural Area that had contaminated the Everglades with high amounts of nitrogen.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  The result of this reduced flow of water was dramatic. There was a 90 - 95% reduction in wading bird populations, declining fish populations and salt water intrusion into the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Davis, 1997"/&gt; If the Florida Everglades were to remain a US landmark, action needed to be taken.

;Normative Scenario
It was in 1993 that the Army Corps of Engineers analyzed the system.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They determined that an ideal situation would be to "get the water right".&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt; In doing so there would be a better flow through the Everglades and a reduced number of canals and levees sending water to tide.

;Transitive Scenario
It was from the development of the Normative Scenario, that the Army Corps of Engineers developed CERP, the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  In the plan they created a time line of projects to be completed, the estimated cost and the ultimate results of improving the ecosystem by having native flora and fauna prosper.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;  They also outline the human benefits of the project.  Not only will the solution be sustainable, as future generations will be able to enjoy the Everglades, but the correction of the water flow and through the creation of storage facilities will reduce the occurrence of droughts and water shortages in southern Florida.&lt;ref name = "Everglades, 2004"/&gt;

'''Environmental geology''', like [[hydrogeology]], is an applied science concerned with the practical application of the principles of geology in the solving of environmental problems. It is a multidisciplinary field that is closely related to [[engineering geology]] and, to a lesser extent, to [[environmental geography]]. Each of these fields involves the study of the interaction of humans with the [[geologic]] environment, including the [[biosphere]], the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], and to some extent the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. In other words, environmental geology is the application of geological information to solve conflicts, minimizing possible adverse [[environmental degradation]] or maximizing possible advantageous condition resulting from the use of natural and modified environment.
 
Environmental geology includes:

* managing geological and hydrogeological resources such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[mineral]]s, [[water (molecule)|water]] (surface and [[ground water]]), and [[land use]]. 
* studying the earth's surface through the disciplines of [[geomorphology]], and [[edaphology]];
* defining and mitigating exposure of natural hazards on humans 
* managing industrial and domestic waste disposal and minimizing or eliminating effects of [[pollution]], and 
* performing associated activities, often involving litigation.

A peer-reviewed journal in the field is ''[[Environmental Earth Sciences]]'' ({{ISSN|1866-6280}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Environmental Earth Sciences | publisher = Springer | url = https://www.springer.com/earth+sciences+and+geography/geology/journal/12665 | accessdate = 2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly ''Environmental Geology'' ({{ISSN|0943-0105}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22251">'''Experimental archaeometallurgy''' is a subset of [[experimental archaeology]] that specifically involves past [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] processes most commonly involving the replication of [[copper]] and [[iron]] objects as well as testing the methodology behind the production of ancient metals and metal objects. Metals and elements used primarily as alloying materials, such as [[tin]], [[lead]], and [[arsenic]], are also a part of experimental research.

==Experimental archaeometallurgy as a sub-discipline==
The theory behind experimental archaeology comes from the new archaeology technique of the 1950s to use modern day examples in the form of experiments and [[Ethnology|ethnologies]] as analogues to past processes.{{sfnp|Forrest|2008|p=?}} Experimental archaeometallurgy is considered a part of general experimental archaeology and is rarely separated in the literature and as such, many of the principles stay the same while there is a greater focus on a single subject.

Archaeometallurgy works as a good field for experimental reproduction because of the evidence that is provided from excavation is a good starting point for reconstruction. Metallurgical remains provide a durable product that has relatively durable evidence of production methods such as [[slag]] and [[refractory ceramic]] remains.{{sfnp|Craddock|1995|p=?}} Experimentation comes in a varied amount of forms including object replication, system replication, behavioral replication, and process replication.&lt;ref&gt;Mathieu J. R., 2002. Introduction – Experimental Archaeology: Replicating Past Objects, Behaviors, and Processes. In J. R. Mathieu (ed.) Experimental Archaeology: Replicating Past Objects, Behaviors, and Processes 1-11. Oxford, [[Archaeopress]]. BAR International Series 1023.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research problems===
Archaeometallurgical experimentation typically takes place in controlled laboratories or tries to remain as authentic as possible by being conducted using only the materials and facilities that were available to the subjects whose technology is trying to be reconstructed. Regardless of location though, the experimentation is always conducted under a different mindset outside the context of what was originally intended.&lt;ref&gt;Pleiner R., 2000. Iron in Archaeology: The European Bloomery Smelters. Prague, Archaeology Ustav Avcr.&lt;/ref&gt;  A constant problem in any type of experimental archaeology is the cultural distance between the archaeologist and the individual who originally was involved with the metallurgy. This difference in mindset may lead to misunderstandings in the processes behind the metallurgy.&lt;ref&gt;Killick D., 1991. The Relevance of Recent African Iron-Smelting Practice to Reconstructions of Prehistoric Smelting Technology. In P.D. Glumes (ed.) Recent Trends in Archaeometallurgical Research 47-54. Philadelphia, MASCA. MASCA Research Papers in Science and Anthropology Vol. 8 Part 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Second to this, not all experiments are successful and it is hard to determine if this is the fault of the techniques used or the individual conducting the experiment.{{sfnp|Craddock|1995|p=22}}

===Connection with ethnoarchaeology===
[[Ethnoarchaeology]] has been widely used in conjunction with experimental archaeology using the techniques of modern peoples as analogues to the processes of the past. The attempted use of ethnology in archaeology tries to counteract the cultural distance of the researcher from process by changing the context of experimentation. Africa has played a large role in reconstructing [[copper smelting]] and [[bloomery]] iron furnaces as there are still several places that practice a workshop production of iron.&lt;ref&gt;Bernus S. and Echard N., 1985. Metal Working in the Agadez Region (Niger): An Ethno-Archaeological Approach. In Paul T. Craddock and M. J. Hughes (ed.) Furnaces and Smelting Technology in Antiquity 71-80. London, British Museum. Occasional Papers No. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Killick 1991"&gt;Killick 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  Killick&lt;ref name="Killick 1991"/&gt; has been one such archaeologist to utilize surviving iron production in Africa to gain further insight into how other furnaces from around the world may have been constructed.

==Mining==
[[Mining]] is among the first steps of producing metal and as such is one of the foci of experimental archaeometallurgy. However, experimental research on mining is mostly limited to firesetting and the reproduction and use of mining tools.

===Firesetting===
[[Firesetting]] is the process of exposing a rock face to high temperatures to induce cracking, spalling, and an overall increase to the brittleness of the rock in order to make it more susceptible to mining processes.&lt;ref&gt;Timberlake S., 2007. The Use of Experimental Archaeology/Archaeometallurgy for the Understanding and Reconstruction of Early Bronze Age Mining and Smelting Technologies. In S. L. Niece et al. (ed.) Metals and Mines: Studies in Archaeometallurgy 27-36. London, Archetype Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Understanding the process of firesetting has been a crucial element to the development of an archaeological history of mining and as such has been the subject of several experiments to reproduce the technique.&lt;ref&gt;Crew P., 1990. Firesetting Experiment at Rhiw Goch. 1989. In P. Crew and S. Crew (ed.) Early Mining in the British Isles 57. Maentwrog, Plas Tan y Bwlch. Occasional Paper No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis A., 1990. Firesetting Experiments on the Great Orme, 1989. In P. Crew and S. Crew (ed.) Early Mining in the British Isles 55-56. Maentwrog, Plas Tan y Bwlch. Occasional Paper No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pickin J. and Timberlake S., 1988. Stone Hammers and Firesetting.

Crew and S. Crew (ed.) Early Mining in the British Isles 53-54. Maentwrog, Plas Tan y Bwlch. Occasional Paper No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Timberlake 2007"&gt;Timberlake 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically firesetting experiments are conducted by setting a fire next to a predetermined rock face while taking measurements on the amount of and type of fuel used, temperatures of the fire and rock face, the amount of spalling before and after excavation, as well as the amount of time required for the different procedures.&lt;ref name="Timberlake 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crew 1990"&gt;Crew 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis 1990"&gt;Lewis 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pickin and Timberlake 1988"&gt;Pickin and Timberlake 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Timberlake 1990"&gt;Timberlake 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  This examination allows for several possible inferences to be made about the mining process including the total amount of fuel a mining site may have needed to complete and its effects on the surrounding environment as well as how mining labor could have been organized. One outcome of firesetting experimentation is the realization that the quenching, or dousing the rock face with water after heating, is not necessary to making the rock face easier to excavate.&lt;ref&gt;Timberlake 2007, 30&lt;/ref&gt;  The quenching process had been a standard step in most experiments with firesetting,&lt;ref name="Timberlake 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crew 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Timberlake 1990"/&gt; but now more research is necessary to answer the new question of why quenching was used if it was not effective.

===Mining tools===
Experimental reconstruction of tools used in prehistoric mining is often written about in conjunction with the tools use after the process of firesetting.&lt;ref name="Timberlake 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crew 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pickin and Timberlake 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Timberlake 1990"/&gt;  The experimental mining tool assemblage are primarily made up of [[hammerstone]]s and antler picks that are reconstructed using willow and hazel sticks, [[rawhide (textile)|rawhide]], and hemp string to implement various hafting techniques and methods of utilization.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock B., 1990. The Experimental Hafting of Stone Mining Hammers. In P. Crew and S. Crew (ed.) Early Mining in the British Isles 58. Maentwrog, Plas Tan y Bwlch. Occasional Paper No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smelting==
[[Smelting]] or the reduction of an [[ore]] to its metallic state is the primary source of experimentation in archaeometallurgy.&lt;ref name="Timberlake 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coles J., 1979. Experimental Archaeology. London et. al, Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bamberger M., 1985. The Working Conditions of the Ancient Copper Smelting Process. In Paul T. Craddock and M. J.

Oddy]] (ed.) Aspects of Early Metallurgy 13-26. London, British Museum. Department of Science Occasional Paper No. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  In its simplest form smelting can be accomplished by placing an ore sample between two pieces of combusting [[charcoal]] in an oxygen [[Redox|reducing]] atmosphere with a compressed air source to feed the combustion and result in temperatures high enough to smelt metal.&lt;ref&gt;Zwicker 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  But to reach this final metallic state several things need to be done first including the processing of the ore to remove waste or [[gangue]] material, the possible roasting of the ore, the smelting of the ore, and then there is the possibility of refining the metal through a series of remelts. Then, through chemical or microscopic analysis, the products of the smelt are analyzed and compared with the findings of archaeological excavation in order to examine the likelihood of various manufacturing processes.&lt;ref&gt;Craddock Paul, Meeks N., and S.

Metals and Mines: Studies in Archaeometallurgy 37-45. London, Archetype Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tylecote 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper and its alloys===
The first recorded experimental work in copper was conducted by Cushing in 1894 in order to demonstrate that copper plate found in [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell mounds]] in [[Ohio]] could have been produced by the Hopewell people and not come from European trade.&lt;ref&gt;Cushing F. H., 1894. Primitive Copper Working: an Experimental Study. American Anthropologist, Vol. 7, No. 1, 93-117.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Forrest|2008|p=?}}&lt;ref name="Tylecote and Merkel 1985, 4"&gt;Tylecote and Merkel 1985, 4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his experiments, Cushing used antler and stone tools to cut out sheets of copper and puncture round holes in them through a method of pressure and grinding.&lt;ref name="Cushing 1894"&gt;Cushing 1894&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the copper sheet experiments, Cushing also conducted smelting experiments reconstructed from finding at [[Salado Valley]], [[Arizona]] pueblo excavations to reproduce copper artifacts.&lt;ref name="Tylecote and Merkel 1985, 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cushing 1894"/&gt;

===Iron===
The experimental archaeometallurgy of iron is more recent then that of copper in that for the most part was not widely studied until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Pleiner 2000, 132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tylecote and Merkel 1985, 8"&gt;Tylecote and Merkel 1985, 8&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be attributed to the modern smelting of [[wrought iron]] still being produced as an industry up until 1900, when the last of the large-scale production shut down, along with the belief among researchers that many of the same techniques had been passed down since the inception of bloomery iron.&lt;ref name="Tylecote and Merkel 1985, 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Killick 1991, 47"&gt;Killick 1991, 47&lt;/ref&gt;  A static technique simply was not the case as the technology used to make [[Roman Era]] iron showed the use of a technology that had long since disappeared.&lt;ref name="Tylecote and Merkel 1985, 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Killick 1991, 47"/&gt;  That being said research in iron has progressed beyond that of copper due to the greater amount of historic text and surviving remains of iron production.

Several experiments have taken place to reproduce bloomery iron.&lt;ref&gt;Clough R. E., 1985. The Iron Industry in the Iron Age and Romano-British Period. In Paul T. Craddock and M. J. Hughes (ed.) Furnaces and Smelting Technology in Antiquity 179-187. London, British Museum. Occasional Papers No. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coles 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crew 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crew P. and Charlton M. 2007. The Anatomy of a Furnace … and Some of its Ramifications. In S. L. Niece et al. (ed.) Metals and Mines: Studies in Archaeometallurgy 219-225. London, Archetype Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nosek 1985"&gt;Nosek 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleiner 2000"&gt;Pleiner 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Clough&lt;ref name="Clough 1985"&gt;Clough 1985&lt;/ref&gt; presents an average example of experimental ironwork with the reproduction possible Roman bowl furnaces. Clough&lt;ref name="Clough 1985"/&gt; found the reproduction bowl furnaces to be inefficient by producing small amounts of poor quality iron, which, when compared to excavated findings of much larger better quality blooms of iron led to the conclusion that bowl furnaces were not used by the Romans.

===Precious metals===
Experimental work on [[precious metal]]s is limited by the cost of experimentation and by the well-understood technical processes involved. [[Gold]] and [[silver]] are produced in a similar manner to copper with the additional process of [[cupellation]]. [[Platinum]] is mostly an issue in [[South America]] and is typically left out from experimental archaeometallurgy because of its traditional use as a powdered metal as an additive to produce [[alloy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;75.	Tylecote and Merkel 1985, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of research==
Several sets of data can be collected during the experimental process of smelting including fuel consumption rates,&lt;ref name="Pleiner 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nosek E., 1985. The Polish Smelting Experiments in Furnaces with Slag Pits. In Paul T. Craddock and M. J. Hughes (ed.) Furnaces and Smelting Technology in Antiquity 165-177. London, British Museum. Occasional Papers No. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tylecote and Boydell 1978"&gt;Tylecote and Boydell 1978&lt;/ref&gt; the effects of variation in furnace airflow,&lt;ref name="Pleiner 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bamberger and Wincierzt 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merkel 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
temperatures,&lt;ref name="Nosek 1985"/&gt; production time,&lt;ref name="Nosek 1985"/&gt; and chemical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Cradock, Meeks, and Timberlake 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replication of techniques===
The replication of technique in copper production includes a vast number of possibilities in trying to recreate what has been found through archaeological excavation. Tylecote and Boydell&lt;ref name="Tylecote and Boydell 1978"/&gt; have experimented on possible explanations for the levels of iron found in certain copper objects and the possibility of removing excess iron through the re-melting of the copper. Crew&lt;ref&gt;Crew P., 1991. The Experimental Production of Prehistoric Bar Iron. Journal of the Historical Metallurgy Society, Vol. 25 No. 1 21-36.&lt;/ref&gt; has also done experimental work on iron to show possible loss in iron mass due to the processes involved with working the metal from bloom to billet which concluded with a loss of 75% in slag, impurities, and iron metal.

===Alloys===
Alloys that are not [[bronze]] and [[brass]] have had a limited representation in the literature for archaeometallurgy. This is mostly due to lack of interest or evidence in the archaeological record. [[Arsenical copper]] is one such limited research topic with some experimental work done by Pollard, Thomas, and Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard A. M., Thomas R. G., and P. A. Williams, 1989. Some Experiments Concerning the Smelting of Arsenical Copper. In P. Budd (ed.) Archaeological Sciences 169-174. Oxford, Oxbow Books. Monograph No. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Through several experimental smeltings of copper ores including arsenic, Pollard, Thomas, and Williams found that arsenic in copper is retained in higher levels when a lower smelting temperature is used, implying that arsenical copper may have been the result of early smelting technologies where temperatures where unable to pass a certain point.

Lead experimentation has been limited mostly because of its ease in production. Ore containing lead can be easily smelted, re-melted, and worked and as such there is not much difficultly in understanding how past societies may have produced lead.&lt;ref&gt;Tylecote and Merkel 1985, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;  When lead experiments are conducted, they are done much in the same fashion as copper smelting experiments taking notes on quantitative elements such as completion time, airflow rates, fuel usage, and the resulting amount and composition of metal from the smelt.&lt;ref&gt;Hetherington R., 1991. Investigations into Primitive Lead Smelting and Its Products. In [[William Andrew Oddy|W.A. Oddy]] (ed.) Aspects of Early Metallurgy 27-40. London, British Museum. Department of Science Occasional Paper No. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, lead is a toxic element and special care has to take place in order to experiment with it, which makes limitations on the experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Bayley J., Crossley D., and M. Ponting, 2008. Metals and Metalworking: A Research Framework for Archaeometallurgy. Wakefield, The Charlesworth Group. Historical Metallurgy Society Occasional Publication No. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other aspects===
Artifact replication plays an important role in comparing artifact use. Often objects are made not just to prove a manufacturing process or to sit in a display case, but to show that a given object will show signs of wear that are similar to those present in the archaeological record. Roberts and Ottaway&lt;ref name=R&amp;O&gt;Roberts B. and Ottaway B., 2003. The Use and Significance of Socketed Axes During the Late Bronze Age. European Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 6, No. 2, 119-140.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted such experimental reconstructions by casting [[bronze axe]]s using them in a preconceived manner and then comparing the results against known archaeological remains. Results gathered from such experimentation have found that objects have comparable wear patterns and there are European socketed axes that were deposited used as well as unused.&lt;ref name=R&amp;O/&gt;  Tool mark identification can also go the opposite ways using experimental reconstruction to show the difference between various material media and the wear patterns they leave.  Greenfield&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield H. J., 2002. Distinguishing Metal (Steel and Low-tin Bronze) from Stone (Flint and Obsidian) Tool Cut Marks on Bone: An Experimental Approach. In J. R. Mathieu (ed.) Experimental Archaeology: Replicating Past Objects, Behaviors, and Processes 35-54. Oxford, Archaeopress. BAR International Series 1023.&lt;/ref&gt; gives one such experiment where steel, bronze, and stone tool marks on bone are all researched and examples are given for how they might be seen in the archaeological record.

Energy consumption and efficiency is another topic of interest in archaeometallurgy. Tree felling and land clearing experiments involving comparison of stone, bronze, and steel axes are popular with a number of archaeologists&lt;ref name=M&amp;M97&gt;Mathieu J. R. and Meyer D. A., 1997. Comparing Axe Heads of Stone, Bronze, and Steel: Studies in Experimental Archaeology. Journal of Field Archaeology, Vol. 24, No. 3, 333-351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M&amp;M02&gt;Mathieu J. R. and Meyer D. A., 2002. Reconceptualizing Experimental Archaeology: Assessing the Process of Experimentation. In J. R. Mathieu (ed.)

American Antiquity, Vol. 38, No. 3, 344-350.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these types of experiments, factors such as time spent and oxygen intake of the researchers are taken into account to try to find similarities in past life ways use of energy.&lt;ref name=M&amp;M97/&gt;&lt;ref name=M&amp;M02/&gt;&lt;ref name=S&amp;S73/&gt;

'''Formal learning''' is education normally delivered by trained teachers in a systematic intentional way within a [[school]], [[higher education]] or [[university]]. It is one of three forms of [[learning]] as defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the others being [[informal learning]], which typically takes place naturally as part of some other activity, and [[nonformal learning|non-formal learning]], which includes everything else, such as sports instruction provided by non-trained educators without a formal [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/recognitionofnon-formalandinformallearning-home.htm |title=Recognition of Non-formal and Informal Learning - Home |website=OECD |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal learning theory ==
Formal learning theory is the formal study of inductive problems and their intrinsic solvability for both ideal and computable agents. Modal operator theory has very little to do with formal learning theory especially with respects to
# The significance of method and methodological recommendations.
# The idea of weakening the convergence criterion in order to get more problems within the scope of reliable inquiry.

== The origin of formal learning theory  ==
Research on logical reliability theory was first pursued under the name formal learning theory, given to the discipline by (Osherson et al. 1986). This name is somewhat misleading, as it suggests a study of how cognizers learn. With this in mind, Kevin Kelly renamed the approach computational epistemology (1991, 1996), which reflects its historical roots in computability theory while avoiding misinterpretation. 

Computer scientists are in the business of recommending and providing programs and algorithms for various empirical purposes. From this perspective learning is about reliable convergence to correct answers on various empirical questions. Thus learning theory is the formal study of inductive problems and their complexity and solvability for both ideal and Turing-computable agents.

In the middle of 1960s, (Gold 1967) applied formal learning theory to theories of language acquisition in which a child is asked to reliably converge to a grammar for its natural language. Very briefly, languages are modeled as recursive enumerable sets (or r.e sets) and a child is conceived as a function required to converge to a correct r.e index for a given set over all possible enumerations of the set. About the same time H.Reicherbanch's students, Hilary Putnam (Putnam 1963) applied learning theory to criticize Carnap's confirmation theory. Putnam at tempted to show Carnap's justification standards for a probabilistic theory of confirmation, there exists a hypothesis the Carnapian extrapolation algorithm cannot learn even given every possible instance of the hypothesis. Further mathematical treatments of the problems of induction were provided by (Blum and Blum 1975) and (Angluin 1980). 

Formal learning theory never really caught on among philosophers, perhaps because philosophers found it hard to see how the formal results concerning induction apply to classical philosophical. Due to the work of Kevin T. Kelly, Clark Glymour, Dan Osherson and others, formal learning theory has been adapted to questions in philosophy of science, methodology and epistemology.

== Logical Reliability ==
Formal learning theory offers a well-defined notion of reliability for methods, which importantly does not serve as a condition for knowledge. Though it is not an epistemological paradigm in the traditional sense, learning theory can play an important role in knowledge studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2339">'''Fred''', or '''FRED''', was an early [[chatterbot]] written by [[Robby Garner]].

==History==
The name Fred was initially suggested by Karen Lindsey, and then Robby jokingly came up with an acronym, "Functional Response Emulation Device."&lt;ref name="tvshop"&gt;Robitron Software Research, Inc. [http://www.simonlaven.com/fred.htm "The Simon Laven Page"] ''Robitron History''&lt;/ref&gt; Fred has also been implemented as a Java application by [[Paco Nathan]] called [http://simonlaven.com/jfred.htm JFRED].

Fred Chatterbot is designed to explore [[Natural language processing|Natural Language]] communications between people and computer programs. In particular, this is a study of conversation between people and ways that a computer program can learn from other people's conversations to make its own conversations.&lt;ref name="jfred"&gt;L. Caputo, R. Garner, P. Nathan. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=304915 "FRED, Milton and Barry: the evolution of intelligent agents for the Web"], Advances in intelligent systems, 1997.
''portal.acm.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred used a minimalistic "stimulus-response" approach. It worked by storing a database of statements and their responses, and made its own reply by looking up the input statements made by a user and then rendering the corresponding response from the database. This approach simplified the complexity of the rule base, but required expert coding and editing for modifications.

Fred was a predecessor to [[Albert One]], which Garner used in 1998 and 1999 to win the [[Loebner Prize#Winners|Loebner Prize]].&lt;ref name="masters"&gt;Søren Gjellerup Christiansen [http://www.daimi.au.dk/~gjelle/thesis/cdrom/index.html "Techniques applied to pass the Turing Test"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914091424/http://www.daimi.au.dk/~gjelle/thesis/cdrom/index.html |date=2007-09-14 }} ''Master's Thesis''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Gokkun'''|ゴックン}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for sexual activity in which a person consumes the [[semen]] of one or more men, usually from some kind of container.&lt;ref name="dufour"&gt;{{cite book|title=La cité perverse: libéralisme et pornographie|series=Bibliothèque Médiations|first=Dany-Robert|last=Dufour|publisher=[[Éditions Denoël]]|year=2009|isbn=2-207-26120-4 |page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=xnvZTOeeN4qVOpmKlf8I }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly used containers include cups, large [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]]s, bowls, baking pans, and wine or cocktail glasses.

"Gokkun" can also refer to the sexual act of swallowing semen after performing [[fellatio]] or participating in a [[bukkake]].&lt;ref name="dufour"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Extremes: contradictions in contemporary Japan|first=G.

The '''historical-grammatical method''' is a Christian [[biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] method that strives to discover the biblical authors' original intended meaning in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Baker Book House | isbn = 0-8010-3413-2 | last = Elwell | first = Walter A. | title = [[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]] | location = Grand Rapids, Mich. | year = 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the primary method of interpretation for many conservative [[Protestantism|Protestant]] exegetes who reject the [[historical-critical method]] to various degrees (from the complete rejection of historical criticism of some [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Protestants to the moderated acceptance of it in the Roman Catholic tradition since [[Pope]] [[Pius XII]]),&lt;ref&gt;The Biblical Commission's Document "The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church" Text and Commentary; ed. Joseph A. Fitzmyer; Subsidia Biblica 18; Rome: Editrice Pontificio Istituto Bibllico, 1995. See esp. p. 26, "The historical-critical method is the indispensable method for the scientific study of the meaning of ancient texts."&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the overwhelming reliance on historical-critical interpretation, often to the exclusion of all other hermeneutics, in [[liberal Christianity]].

The [[Orthodox Church]] primarily employs a spiritual, [[Allegorical interpretation of the Bible|allegorizing hermeneutic]] heavily dependent on [[Christian typology|typological]] connections drawn by New Testament writers and the church fathers of the first several centuries of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;See T. G. Stylianopoulos, "Scripture and Tradition in the Church," in The Cambridge Companion to Orthodox Christian Theology (eds. M. Cunningham and E. Theokritoff; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 21-34.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic Church]] divides hermeneutic into four senses: the literal, allegorical, moral, and anagogical; however, interpretation is always subject to the Church's [[magisterium]]. The process for determining the original meaning of the text is through examination of the grammatical and syntactical aspects, the historical background, the literary genre as well as theological (canonical) considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The historical-grammatical method distinguishes between the one original meaning of the text and its significance. The significance of the text is essentially the application or contextualization of the principles from text.

==Original meaning of texts==
The aim of the historical-grammatical method is to discover the meaning of the passage as the original author would have intended and what the original hearers would have understood. The original passage is seen as having only a single meaning or sense. As Milton S. Terry said, "A fundamental principle in grammatico-historical exposition is that the words and sentences can have but one significance in one and the same connection. The moment we neglect this principle we drift out upon a sea of uncertainty and conjecture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Many practice the historical-grammatical method using the inductive method, a general three-fold approach to the text: observation, interpretation, and application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each step builds upon the other, which follows in order. The first step of observation involves an examination of words, structure, structural relationships and literary forms. After observations are formed, then the second step of interpretation involves asking interpretative questions, formulating answers to those questions, integration and summarization of the passage. After the meaning is derived through interpretation, the third step of application involves determining both the theoretical and practical significance of the text and appropriately applying this significance to today's modern context. There is also a heavy emphasis on personal application that extends into all aspects of the practitioner's life. Theologian Robert Traina, in his 1952 ''Methodical Bible Study'', wrote that "the applicatory step is that for which all else exists. It represents the final purpose of Bible study."&lt;ref name="Traina"&gt;{{Cite book

| page = 217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically speaking, the grammatical-historical method of interpretation is distinct from the determination of the passage's significance in light of that interpretation. Together, interpretation of the passage and determining the meaning define the term "hermeneutics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Comparison with other methods of interpretations==
===Reader-response method===
In the [[reader-response]] method, the focus is on how the book is perceived by the reader, not on the intention of the author. Those who regard the text as divinely inspired and seek to determine the intention of the divine author tend to stay away from this method because of the many interpretations, often contrary to scripture, arising from a reader response of the text without any formal foundation of the text.

===Historical-critical method===
The [[historical-critical method]] is used by many academic Bible scholars in universities, including many Roman Catholic and Protestant institutions. The method uses [[higher criticism]], in an attempt to discover the sources and factors that contributed to the making of the text as well as to determine what it meant to the original audience. Scholars who use the historical-critical method treat the Bible as they would any other text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical-critical scholars as such are also typically less interested in determining what the text means for people today.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} For those reasons, some traditional scholars and conservative Christians tend to reject the method, but even many of them use aspects of it that naturally overlap with the historical-grammatical method, such as attempting to determine what was meant when the passage in question was written.

{{Distinguish|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature}}
{{redirects here|Animal naming|other uses|Animal names}}

The '''International Code of Zoological Nomenclature''' ('''ICZN''') is a widely accepted [[Convention (norm)|convention]] in [[zoology]] that rules the formal [[scientific name|scientific naming]] of [[organisms]] treated as [[animal]]s. It is also informally known as the '''ICZN Code''', for its publisher, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (which shares the acronym "ICZN"). The rules principally regulate:
* How names are correctly established in the frame of [[binominal nomenclature]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/includes/page.jsp?article=5 ICZN Code Art. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Which name must be used in case of name conflicts
* How scientific literature must cite names
Zoological nomenclature is independent of other systems of nomenclature, for example [[botanical nomenclature]]. This implies that animals can have the same generic names as plants.

The rules and recommendations have one fundamental aim: to provide the maximum universality and continuity in the naming of all animals, except where [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] judgment dictates otherwise. The code is meant to guide only the nomenclature of animals, while leaving zoologists freedom in classifying new [[taxon|taxa]].

In other words, whether a species itself is or is not a recognized  entity is a subjective decision, but what name should be applied to it is not. The code applies only to the latter. A new animal name published without adherence to the code may be deemed simply "unavailable" if it fails to meet certain criteria, or fall entirely out of the province of science (e.g., the "scientific name" for the [[Loch Ness Monster]]).

The rules in the code determine what names are valid for any taxon in the [[Family (biology)|family]] group, [[genus]] group, and [[species]] group. It has additional (but more limited) provisions on names in higher [[Taxonomic rank|rank]]s. The code recognizes no [[case law]]. Any dispute is decided first by applying the code directly, and not by reference to precedent.

The code is also [[retroactive law|retroactive]] or [[retrospective]], which means that previous editions of the code, or previous other rules and conventions have no force any more today,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Code Art. 86.3]&lt;/ref&gt; and the nomenclatural acts published 'back in the old times' must be evaluated only under the present edition of the code. In cases of disputes concerning the interpretation, the usual procedure is to consult the French Code, lastly a case can be brought to the commission who has the right to publish a final decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Code Art. 89]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
In regulating the names of animals it holds by six central principles, which were first set out (as principles) in the third edition of the code (1985):

===Principle of binominal nomenclature===

This is the principle that the scientific name of a species, and not of a taxon at any other rank, is a combination of two names; the use of a [[trinomen]] for the name of a subspecies and of uninominal names for taxa above the species group is in accord with this principle.&lt;ref name="CodeGlossary"&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Code Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that in the system of nomenclature for animals, the name of a species is composed of a combination of a [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] and a [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]]; together they make a "[[binomen]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Code Glossary, "binomen"]&lt;/ref&gt; No other rank can have a name composed of two names. Examples:
:Species ''[[Giraffa camelopardalis]]''
* Subspecies have a name composed of three names, a "trinomen": [[name of a biological genus|generic name]], [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]], [[subspecific name]]:
:Subspecies ''[[Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi]]''
* Taxa at a rank above species have a name composed of one name, a "uninominal name".
:Genus ''[[Giraffa]]'', family [[Giraffidae]]
In botanical nomenclature, the equivalent for "binominal nomenclature" is "binary nomenclature" (or sometimes "[[binomial nomenclature]]").

===Principle of priority===
{{main article|Principle of Priority}}

This is the principle that the correct formal scientific name for an animal [[taxon]], the ''[[Valid name (zoology)|valid name]]'', correct to use, is the oldest [[available name]] that applies to it.&lt;ref name="CodeGlossary" /&gt;
It is the most important principle—the fundamental guiding precept that preserves zoological nomenclature stability. It was first formulated in 1842 by a committee appointed by the [[British Association]] to consider the rules of zoological nomenclature. [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]] wrote the committee's report.

Example:

:Nunneley 1837 established ''[[Limax maculatus]]'' (Gastropoda), Wiktor 2001 classified it as a junior synonym of ''[[Limax maximus]]'' Linnæus 1758 from S and W Europe. ''Limax maximus'' was established first, so if Wiktor's 2001 classification is accepted, ''Limax maximus'' takes precedence over ''Limax maculatus'' and must be used for the species. 
There are approximately 2-3 million cases of this kind for which this principle is applied in zoology.

===Principle of coordination===

The ''principle of coordination'' is that within the family group, genus group and species group, a name established for a taxon at any rank in the group is simultaneously established with the same author and date for taxa based on the same name-bearing type at other ranks in the corresponding group.&lt;ref name="CodeGlossary" /&gt; 
In other words, publishing a new zoological name automatically and simultaneously establishes all corresponding names in the relevant other ranks with the same type.

In the species-group, publishing a species name (the [[binomen]]) [[Giraffa camelopardalis|''Giraffa camelopardalis'' Linnaeus, 1758]] also establishes the subspecies name (the [[trinomen]]) ''Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis'' Linnaeus, 1758. The same applies to the name of a subspecies; this establishes the corresponding species name.

In the genus-group, similarly, publishing the name of a genus also establishes the corresponding name of a subgenus (or vice versa): genus [[Giraffa|''Giraffa'' Linnaeus, 1758]] and subgenus ''Giraffa (Giraffa)'' Linnaeus, 1758.

In the family-group, publication of the name of a family, subfamily, superfamily (or any other such rank) also establishes the names in all the other ranks in the family group (family Giraffidae, superfamily Giraffoidea, subfamily Giraffinae).

Author citations for such names (for example a subgenus) are the same as for the name actually published (for example a genus). It is immaterial if there is an actual taxon to which the automatically established name applies; if ever such a taxon is recognised, there is a name available for it.

===Principle of the first reviser===

This is the principle that in cases of conflicts between simultaneously published divergent acts, the first subsequent author can decide which has precedence.
It supplements the ''[[principle of priority]]'', which states that the first published name takes precedence. The principle of the first reviser deals with situations that cannot be resolved by priority. These items may be two or more different names for the same taxon, two or more names with the same spelling used for different taxa, two or more different spellings of a particular name, etc. In such cases, the first subsequent author who deals with the matter and chooses and publishes the decision in the required manner is the first reviser, and is to be followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Code Art. 24.2].&lt;/ref&gt;

Example:

Linnæus 1758 established ''Strix scandiaca'' and ''Strix noctua'' (Aves), for which he gave different descriptions and referred to different types, but both taxa later turned out to refer to the same species, the [[snowy owl]]. The two names are subjective synonyms. Lönnberg 1931 acted as first reviser, cited both names and selected ''Strix scandiaca'' to have precedence.

A problem is that sometimes the first reviser is unknown. For the [[sperm whale]] Linnæus 1758 established three subjective synonyms, ''Physeter macrocephalus'', ''Physeter catodon'', and ''Physeter microps''. The first reviser remains unknown; both ''Ph. macrocephalus'' and ''Ph. catodon'' are used.

===Principle of homonymy===

This is the principle that the name of each taxon must be unique. Consequently, a name that is a junior homonym of another name must not be used as a valid name.&lt;ref name="CodeGlossary" /&gt;

It means that any one animal name, in one particular spelling, may be used only once (within its group). This is usually the first-published name; any later name with the same spelling (a [[homonym (zoology)|homonym]]) is barred from being used. The principles of [[Principle of Priority|priority]] and [[Principle of the First Reviser|first reviser]] apply here. For family-group names the termination (which is rank-bound) is not taken into account.

Genera are homonyms only if exactly the same — a one-letter difference is enough to distinguish them.

Examples:

:''Argus'' Bohadsch, 1761 (Gastropoda) (was made available for homonymy by ICZN in Opinion 429, Bohadsch 1761 was non-binominal - this had the effect that no other one of the various following names ''Argus'' can be used for a taxon)
:''Argus'' Scopoli, 1763 (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Polyommatinae)
:''Argus'' Scopoli, 1777 (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Satyrinae)
:''Argus'' Poli, 1791 (Bivalvia)
:''Argus'' Temminck, 1807 (Aves)
:''Argus'' Lamarck, 1817 (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae)
:''Argus'' Walckenaer, 1836 (Araneae)
:''Argus'' Gerhard, 1850 (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae: Theclinae)
:Homonyms of ''Argus'' are not:
:''[[Argua]]'' Walker, 1863 (Lepidoptera), ''[[Argusa]]'' Kelham, 1888 (Aves), ''[[Argusina]]'' Hebard, 1927 (Dermaptera), ''[[Arcus (insect)|Arcus]]'' Hong, 1983 (Diptera), ''[[Argas]]'' Latreille, 1795 (Araneae), ''[[Argulus]]'' Müller, 1785 (Crustacea).

:Homonyms are not: ''[[Isomya]]'' Cutler &amp; Cutler, 1985 (Sipunculida), ''[[Isomyia]]'' Walker, 1859 (Diptera).
:Homonyms are not: ''[[Adelomya]]'' Mulsant &amp; Verreaux, 1866 (Aves), ''[[Adelomyia]]'' Bonaparte, 1854 (Aves), ''[[Adelomys]]'' Gervais, 1853 (Mammalia), ''[[Adolomys]]'' Shevyreva, 1989 (Mammalia), ''[[Adulomya]]'' Kuroda, 1931 (Bivalvia).

In species, there is a difference between primary and secondary homonyms. There can also be double homonyms (same genus and species). A slight difference in spelling is tolerated if Article 58 applies.

''Primary homonyms'' are those with the same genus and  same species in their original combination. The difference between a primary junior homonym and a subsequent use of a name is undefined, but it is commonly accepted that if the name referred to another species or form, and if there is in addition no evidence the author knew that the name was previously used, it is considered as a junior homonym.

Examples: 
:Drury (1773) established ''[[Cerambyx maculatus]]'' (Coleoptera) for a species from [[Jamaica]]. Fueßlin (1775) established ''[[Cerambyx maculatus]]'' for a different species from Switzerland, and did not refer to Drury's name. Fueßlin's name is a junior primary homonym.
:Scopoli (1763) established ''[[Curculio fasciatus]]'' (Coleoptera) for a species from Slovenia. Strøm (1768) established ''[[Curculio fasciatus]]'' for another species from Norway. De Geer (1775) established ''[[Curculio fasciatus]]'' for a 3rd species from Sweden. Müller (1776) established ''[[Curculio fasciatus]]'' for a 4th species from Denmark. Fourcroy (1785) established ''[[Curculio fasciatus]]'' for a 5th species from France. Olivier (1790) established ''[[Curculio fasciatus]]'' for a 6th species from France. Marsham (1802) established ''[[Curculio fasciatus]]'' for a 7th species from Britain. All these names had descriptions that clarified that different species were meant, and that their authors did not know that the name had been established by a previous author.

''Secondary homonyms'' can be produced if taxa with the same specific name but different original genus are later classified in the same genus (Art. 57.3, 59). 
A secondary synonym{{clarify|should that read "secondary homonym"?|date=March 2016}} is only a temporary state, it is only effective in this classification. If another classification is applied, the secondary homonymy may not be produced, and the involved name can be used again (Art. 59.1). A name does not become unavailable or unusable if it was once in the course of history placed in such a genus where it produced a secondary homonymy with another name.
This is one of the rare cases where a zoological species does not have a stable specific name and a unique species-author-year combination, it can have two names at the same time.

Example:
:Nunneley (1837) established ''[[Limax maculatus]]'' (Gastropoda), Wiktor (2001) classified it as a junior synonym of ''[[Limax maximus|Limax (Limax) maximus]]'' Linnæus, 1758 from S and W Europe. Kaleniczenko, 1851 established ''[[Krynickillus maculatus]]'' for a different species from Ukraine. Wiktor, 2001 classified both ''Limax maximus'' Linnæus, 1758 and ''Krynickillus maculatus'' Kaleniczenko, 1851 in the genus ''[[Limax]]''. This meant that ''L. maculatus'' Nunneley, 1837 and ''K. maculatus'' Kaleniczenko, 1851 were classified in the same genus, so both names were secondary homonyms in the genus [[Limax]], and the younger name (from 1851) could not be used for the Ukrainian species. This made it necessary to look for the next younger available name that could be used for the Ukrainian species. This was ''[[Limax ecarinatus]]'' Boettger, 1881, a junior synonym of ''K. maculatus'' Kaleniczenko, 1851.
:For Wiktor (2001) and those authors who follow Wiktor's system the name of the Ukrainian species must be ''[[Limax ecarinatus]]'' Boettger, 1881. For the others who classify ''[[Limacus]]'' as a separate genus, the name of the Ukrainian species must be ''[[Limacus maculatus]]'' (Kaleniczenko, 1851).
:So the Ukrainian species can have two names, depending from its generic classification. ''[[Limax ecarinatus]]'', ''[[Limacus maculatus]]'', the same species.

Article 59.3 states that in exceptional cases, junior secondary homonyms replaced before 1961 by substitute names can become invalid, "...unless the substitute name is not in use," an exception of the exception. However, the ICZN Code does not give an example for such a case. It seems that this passage in the ICZN Code is widely ignored. It also does not define what the expression "is not in use" should mean.

Example:

:''[[Glischrus caelata]]'' Studer, 1820 (Gastropoda) was once classified in the genus ''[[Helix (gastropod)|Helix]]'', and became a junior secondary homonym of ''[[Helix caelata]]'' [Vallot], 1801. Locard (1880) established a replacement name ''[[Helix glypta]]'', which has very rarely been used. The species is now known as ''[[Trochulus caelatus]]'' (Studer, 1820), and Art. 59.3 is commonly ignored.&lt;ref&gt;The publication by [Vallot] (1801) has not been unambiguously recognized as published work in the sense of the Code Art. 8, which might be another reason to ignore Art. 59.3 in this case.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Double homonymy'' (genus and species) is no homonymy: if the genera are homonyms and belong to different animal groups, the same specific names can be used in both groups.

Examples: 
:The name ''[[Noctua (moth)|Noctua]]'' Linnæus, 1758 was established for a lepidopteran subgenus. In 1764 he established a genus ''Noctua'' Linné ,1764 for birds, ignoring that he had already used this name a few years ago in Lepidoptera. ''Noctua'' Linné, 1764 (Aves) is a junior homonym of ''Noctua'' Linnæus, 1758 (Lepidoptera).
:[[François Alexandre Pierre de Garsault|Garsault]] (1764) used ''Noctua'' for a bird and established a name ''[[Noctua caprimulgus]]'' Garsault, 1764 (Aves). Fabricius (1775) established a name ''[[Noctua caprimulgus]]'' Fabricius, 1775 (Lepidoptera), thus creating a double homonym. Double homonymy is no homonymy, both names are available.
:The same happened with ''[[Noctua variegata]]'' Jung, 1792 (Lepidoptera) and ''[[Noctua variegata]]'' Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1830 (Aves).

For ''disambiguating'' one genus-group name from its homonym, it is important to cite author and year. Citing the author alone is often not sufficient.

Examples:

: ''[[moray eel|Echidna]]'' Forster, 1777 (Actinopterygii), not ''[[Echidna]]'' Cuvier, 1797 (Mammalia)
:''[[Ansa (moth)|Ansa]]'' Walker, 1858 (Lepidoptera), not ''Ansa'' Walker, 1868 (Hemiptera)
:''[[Helix balcanica]]'' Kobelt, 1876, not ''[[Helix balcanica]]'' Kobelt, 1903 (both Gastropoda)
:''[[Conus catenatus]]'' Sowerby, 1850, not ''[[Conus catenatus]]'' Sowerby, 1875 (both Gastropoda)

The name ''Ansa'' can only be used for a lepidopteran taxon. If that name cannot be used (for example because an older name established prior to 1858 takes precedence), this does not mean that the 1868 name can be used for a hemipteran genus. The only option to use the 1868 name for the hemipteran taxon is to get the 1858 name officially suppressed by the [[ICZN Commission|commission]].

In some cases, the same genus-group or species-group name was published in the same year by the same author. In these cases it is useful to cite the page where the name was established.

:''[[Amydona]]'' Walker, 1855 (Lepidoptera: Limacodidae) (p. 1110), not ''[[Amydona]]'' Walker, 1855 (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae) (p. 1413)
:''[[Betousa]]'' Walker, 1865 (Lepidoptera: Thyridae) (p. 1111), not ''[[Betousa]]'' Walker, 1865 (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) (p. 1208).
:''[[Cicada variegata]]'' Fabricius, 1775 (p. 684), not ''[[Cicada variegata]]'' Fabricius, 1775 (p. 686) (both Auchenorrhyncha).
:''[[Noctua marginata]]'' Fabricius, 1775 (p. 597), not ''[[Noctua marginata]]'' Fabricius, 1775 (p. 610) (both Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).
:''Clausilia (Albinaria) oertzeni'' Boettger, 1889 (p. 42), not ''Clausilia (Albinaria) schuchi'' var. ''oertzeni'' Boettger, 1889 (p. 52) (both Gastropoda: Clausiliidae).

There are cases where two homonyms were established by the same author in the same year on the same page:

:''Zonites verticillus'' var. ''graeca'' Kobelt, 1876 (Gastropoda) (p. 48), not ''Zonites albanicus'' var. ''graeca'' Kobelt, 1876 (p. 48).

Animal, plant, and fungi nomenclature are entirely independent from each other. The most evident shortcoming of this situation (for their use in [[biodiversity informatics]]) is that the same generic name can be used simultaneously for animals and plants. For this kind of homonym the expression "hemihomonym" is sometimes used. Far more than 1000 such names are known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herba.msu.ru/shipunov/os/homonyms/index.php Moscow State University hemihomonyms database]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:

:The generic name ''[[Dryas (plant)|Dryas]]'' L. (1753) represents a genus of magnoliophytan plants (family Rosaceae), and at the same time ''[[Dryas iulia|Dryas]]'' Hübner, 1807 is also a lepidopteran insect genus (family Nymphalidae).
:The genus ''Tandonia'' was established in animals (Gastropoda: ''[[Tandonia]]''), in plants (Euphorbiaceae) and in Fungi (Ascomycetes).
:Other examples for sometimes well known plant names with zoological equivalents are ''Aotus'' (Fabaceae and Mammalia), ''Arenaria'' (Caryophyllaeceae and Aves), ''Betula''(Betulaceae and Hymenoptera), ''Chloris'' (Cactaceae and Aves), ''Dugesia'' (Asteraceae and Plathelminthes), ''Erica'' (Ericaceae and Araneae), ''Hystrix'' (Poaceae and Mammalia), ''Iris'' (Asparagales and Orthoptera), ''Liparis'' (Orchidaceae and Actinopterygii), ''Phalaenopsis'' (Asparagales and Aves), ''Pinus'' (Pinaceae and Mollusca), ''Prunella'' (Lamiaceae and Aves), ''Ricinus'' (Fabaceae and Acari), ''Taxus'' (Taxaceae and Mammalia), ''Typha'' (Typhaceae and Porifera), ''Ulva'' (Ulvophyceae and Lepidoptera), ''Viola'' (Violaceae and Lepidoptera).

For names above the family level, the principle of homonymy does not apply.

Examples:

:'''Pulmonata''' is usually used for a very prominent group in [[Gastropoda]], but the name is also (rarely) used for a group in [[Arachnida]].
:'''Reticulata''' is used as an order in [[Foraminifera]], and as an undefined higher group in [[Ephemeroptera]].

Homonyms occur relatively rarely in families (only if generic names are identical or very similar and adding an ending "-idae" produces identical results). Discovering such a homonymy usually produces the same problems as if there were no rules: conflicts between entirely independent and unconnected groups of taxonomists working in different animal groups. Very often the Commission must be asked to take a decision.

Examples:

:''[[Bulimina]]'' (Foraminifera) and ''[[Buliminus]]'' (Gastropoda) give both '''Buliminidae''', and both families were used since the 1880s. When the homonymy was discovered 110 years later in the 1990s, the younger (gastropod) taxon had to receive a new family name, and the commission needed was asked for a solution (Opinion 2018).
:''[[Claria]]'' (Rotifera) and ''[[Clarias]]'' (Actinopterygii) give both '''Clariidae''', but only the actinopterygian fish name was used since 1845. Shortly after Clariidae had been proposed in Rotifera in 1990, the homonymy was discovered and the commission had to decide that the Rotiferan family had to be amended to [[Clariaidae]] (Opinion 2032).

===Principle of typification===

This is the principle that each nominal taxon in the family group, genus group, or species group has—actually or potentially—a name-bearing type fixed that provides the objective standard of reference that determines what the name applies to.

This means that any named [[taxon]] has a [[name-bearing type]], which allows the objective application of that name. Any family-group name must have a type genus, any genus-group name must have a type species, and any species-group name can (not must) have one or more type specimens (holotype, lectotype, neotype, syntypes, or others), usually deposited in a museum collection. 
The [[type genus]] for a ''family-group name'' is simply the genus that provided the stem to which was added the ending "-idae" (for families). Example:
:The family name [[Spheniscidae]] has as its type genus the genus ''[[Spheniscus]]'' Brisson, 1760.

The [[type species]] for a ''genus-group name'' is more complicated and follows exactly defined provisions in articles 67-69. 
Type species are very important, and no general zoological database has recorded the type species for all genera. Except in fishes and some minor groups, type species are rarely reliably recorded in online animal databases. In 60% of the cases the type species can be determined in the original publication. 
The type species is always the original name of the taxon (and not the currently used combination).
 
Example:
:The correctly cited type species of ''Locusta'' Linnæus, 1758 (Caelifera) is ''[[Gryllus migratorius]]'' Linnæus, 1758, not ''[[Locusta migratoria]]'' (Linnæus, 1758).

Designation and fixation have different meanings. A designation is the proposal of the type species. It is not necessary to have spelled the name of the genus or species correctly with correct authors (articles 67.2.1, 67.6, 67.7), type species are always the correctly spelled name. If the designation is valid, the type species is fixed.

A designation can also be invalid and ineffective—for example—if the genus had already a previously fixed type species, or if a type species was proposed that was not originally included, or contradicted the description or figure for a genus for which no species had originally been included.

There are various possible modes of type species designation. This is their order of legal importance, with approximate proportions of occurrence&lt;ref&gt;These proportions apply to 366 verified European non-marine mollusc genera ([www.animalbase.org]), presumed to represent a more-or-less representative animal group.&lt;/ref&gt; and examples:

*Superior type fixation:
::Designation by ICZN under the plenary powers (3 %)
:::Example:
:::''[[Galba]]'' Schrank, 1803 (Gastropoda) was established with one species included, ''[[Galba pusilla]]'' Schrank, 1803. This would be the type species by monotypy. In Opinion 1896 (published in 1998) this type fixation was set aside and ''[[Buccinum truncatulum]]'' Müller, 1774 was fixed as type species under the plenary power(s) (now ''[[Galba truncatula]]'').
::Designation under Art. 70.3 (misidentified type species) (1 %)
:::Examples:
:::''[[Bollingeria]]'' Forcart, 1940 (Gastropoda) was established with its type species ''[[Chondrus pupoides]]'' Krynicki, 1833 proposed by original designation. But Forcart 1940 misidentified the type species and meant ''[[Bulimus lamelliferus]]'' Rossmässler, 1858. It would be convenient to designate ''[[Bulimus lamelliferus]]'' as type species under Art. 70.3.
:::''[[Helisoma]]'' Swainson, 1840 (Gastropoda) was established with one species included, cited by Swainson as "''[[H. bicarinata]]'' Sow. Gen. f. 4". This suggested that the type species was misidentified, and that ''[[Planorbis campanulatus]]'' Say, 1821 and not ''[[Planorbis bicarinatus]]'' Say, 1819 was meant. But since the incorrect type species ''[[Planorbis bicarinatus]]'' has been regarded as type, it would be convenient to fix this as type under Art. 70.3.
*Type fixation in the original work:
::Original designation (31 %)
:::Examples:
:::Montfort 1810 established the genus ''[[Theodoxus]]'' (Gastropoda) and designated ''[[Theodoxus lutetianus]]'' Montfort 1810 as type species (now ''[[Theodoxus fluviatilis]]'').
:::Vest 1867 established the subgenus ''[[Clausilia (Isabellaria)]]'' (Gastropoda) and designated ''[[Clausilia isabellina]]'' Pfeiffer, 1842 as type species (now ''[[Isabellaria isabellina]]'').
:::Riedel 1987 established the genus ''[[Turcozonites]]'' (Gastropoda) and designated ''[[Zonites wandae]]'' Riedel, 1982 as type species (now ''[[Turcozonites wandae]]'').
::Monotypy (28 %)
:::Examples:
:::''[[Anodonta]]'' Lamarck, 1799 (Bivalvia) was originally established with one included nominal species, ''[[Mytilus cygneus]]'' Linnæus, 1758. This is the type species fixed by monotypy (now ''[[Anodonta cygnea]]'').
:::''[[Microcondylaea]]'' Vest 1866 (Bivalvia) was originally established with two included nominal species, ''[[Unio bonellii]]'' Férussac, 1827 and with doubts ''[[Anodonta lata]]'' Rafinesque, 1820. Doubtfully included species do not count, type species is ''[[Unio bonellii]]'' fixed by monotypy (now ''[[Microcondylaea bonellii]]'').
::Absolute tautonymy (2 %)
:::Examples:
:::Kobelt 1871 established the gastropod genus-group name ''[[Candidula]]'' and included 23 species. Among these was ''[[Glischrus candidula]]'' Studer 1820. ''[[Glischrus candidula]]'' is type species fixed by absolute tautonymy (now ''[[Candidula unifasciata]]'').
:::Draparnaud 1801 established the gastropd genus ''[[Succinea]]'' and included two species, ''[[Succinea amphibia]]'' Draparnaud 1801 and ''[[Succinea oblonga]]'' Draparnaud 1801. Among the synonyms of ''[[S. amphibia]]'', Draparnaud listed a name ''[[Helix succinea]]'' Müller 1774. Synonyms do count here, so ''[[Helix succinea]]'' is type species by absolute tautonymy (now ''[[Succinea putris]]'').
:::Kobelt 1904 established the gastropod subgenus ''[[Iberus (Balearica)]]'' and included 10 species. Among these was ''[[Helix balearica]]'' Rossmässler 1838, which Kobelt cited as ''[[Iberus (Balearica) balearicus]]''. The ending -us is irrelevant here, ''[[Helix balearica]]'' is type species by absolute tautonymy (currently ''[[Iberellus balearicus]]'' or ''[[Iberellus hispanicus]]'').
:::''[[Euxinolauria]]'' Lindholm, 1924 (Gastropoda: Lauriidae) was established as a new replacement name for ''[[Caucasica]]'' Caziot &amp; Margier, 1909 (not ''[[Caucasica]]'' Boettger, 1877 (Gastropoda: Clausiliidae)). ''[[Caucasica]]'' Caziot &amp; Margier, 1909 contained originally four species, among which was ''[[Pupa caucasica]]'' Pfeiffer, 1857. This is the type species for ''[[Caucasica]]'' Caziot &amp; Margier, 1909 fixed by absolute tautonymy, and also for ''[[Euxinolauria]]'' (now ''[[Euxinolauria caucasica]]'').
:::The following examples do not represent absolute tautonymy: ''[[Scomber scombrus]]'' Linnæus, 1758 (Actinopterygii), ''[[Babyrousa babyrussa]]'' (Linnæus, 1758) (Mammalia), ''[[Suricata suricatta]]'' (Schreber, 1776) (Mammalia), ''[[Merlangius merlangus]]'' (Linnæus, 1758) (Actinopterygii), ''[[Isabellaria isabellina]]'' (Pfeiffer, 1842) (Gastropoda), ''[[Rupestrella rupestris]]'' (Philippi, 1836) (Gastropoda).
::Linnean tautonymy (0.3 %)
:::Example:
:::Linnæus 1758 established ''[[Castor (genus)|Castor]]'' (Mammalia) and included two species, ''[[Castor fiber]]'' and ''[[Castor moschatus]]''. Among the synonyms of ''[[Castor fiber]]'' was cited the one-word name Castor with references to six pre-Linnean works (Gesner 1598, Rondelet 1554, Jonston 1650, Dodart 1676, Ray 1693 and Aldrovandi 1649). ''[[Castor fiber]]'' Linnæus 1758 is type species fixed by Linnean tautonymy (now ''[[Castor fiber]]'').
*Subsequent methods of type fixation:
::Subsequent monotypy (2 %)
:::Examples:
:::''[[Valvata]]'' Müller, 1773 (Gastropoda) was established with a short description and without species. Müller 1774 included one species ''[[Valvata cristata]]'' Müller 1774. ''[[Valvata cristata]]'' is type species by subsequent monotypy (now ''[[Valvata cristata]]'').
:::''[[Omphiscola]]'' Rafinesque, 1819 (Gastropoda) was established without species included. Beck 1837 [1838] included one species ''[[Buccinum glabrum]]'' Müller, 1774. ''[[Buccinum glabrum]]'' is type species by subsequent monotypy (now ''[[Omphiscola glabra]]'').
::Subsequent absolute tautonymy (only very few cases)&lt;ref&gt;"Subsequent absolute tautonymy" is not used as a term in the Code's fourth edition, but it is a logical consequence of the usage of the term "subsequent monotypy".&lt;/ref&gt;
:::Examples:
:::''[[Alosa Garsault, 1764]]'' (Actinopterygii) was established without included species. As first author, Cuvier, 1829 included two species ''[[Clupea alosa]]'' and ''[[Clupea fincta]]''. Type species is ''[[Clupea alosa]]'' Linnæus 1758 by subsequent absolute tautonymy (now ''[[Alosa alosa]]'').
:::''[[Rupicapra]]'' Garsault, 1764 (Mammalia) was established without included species. As first author, Blainville, 1816 included three species ''[[Capra rupicapra]]'' Linnæus, 1758, ''[[Capra pudu]]'', and ''[[Capra americana]]''. Type species is ''[[Capra rupicapra]]'' by subsequent absolute tautonymy (now ''[[Rupicapra rupicapra]]'').
::Subsequent Linnean tautonymy (only theoretical, there might be no case)
::Subsequent designation (32 %)
:::Examples:
:::''[[Aplexa]]'' Fleming, 1820 (Gastropoda) was established with two species, ''[[Bulla hypnorum]]'' Linnæus, 1758 and ''[[Bulla rivalis]]'' Turton, 1807. Herrmannsen 1846 fixed ''[[Bulla hypnorum]]'' as type by subsequent designation (now ''[[Aplexa hypnorum]]'').
:::''[[Pseudanodonta]]'' Bourguignat 1877 (Bivalvia) was established with seven species, ''[[Anodonta complanata]]'' Rossmässler 1835, and six others. Westerlund 1902 validly designated ''[[Anodonta complanata]]'' as type species (now''[[Pseudanodonta complanata]]'').

A ''species-group name'' can have a name-bearing type specimen, but this is not a requirement. In many cases species-group names have no type specimens, or they are lost. In those cases the application of the species-group name is usually based on common acceptance. If there is no common acceptance, there are provisions in the Code to fix a name-bearing type specimen that is binding for users of that name. Fixing such a name-bearing type should only be done if this is taxonomically necessary (articles 74.7.3, 75.2, 75.3).

Examples:

:''[[Aptenodytes patagonica]]'' Miller, 1778 is either based on a type specimen, perhaps deposited in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] London or somewhere else, or its type is lost. This is now irrelevant because the usage of the name (as ''[[Aptenodytes patagonicus]]'') for the [[king penguin]] is unambiguously accepted.
:The name-bearing type for ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' Linnæus, 1758 is deposited in Uppsala (the bones of [[Carl von Linné]]). This is a [[lectotype]] designated by Stearn 1959, correctly but unnecessarily because the usage of the name was unambiguous at that time, and still is.

* [[Principle of coordination]]
* [[Principle of typification]]

== Structure ==

The code divides names in the following manner:
* Names above the family group
* Family-group names
* Genus-group names
* Species-group names

The names above the family group are regulated only as to the requirements for publication; there is no restriction to the number of ranks and the use of names is not restricted by priority.

The names in the family, genus, and species groups are fully regulated by the provisions in the code. There is no limitation to the number of ranks allowed in the family group. The genus group has only two ranks: ''[[genus]]'' and ''[[subgenus]]''. The species group has only two ranks: ''[[species]]'' and ''[[subspecies]]''.

=== Gender agreement ===&lt;!--This section is linked from ''[[Paratriaenops auritus]]''.--&gt;
In the species group ''gender agreement'' applies. The name of a species, in two parts, a [[binomen]], say, ''[[Loxodonta africana]]'', and of a subspecies, in three parts, a [[trinomen]], say ''[[Canis lupus albus]]'', is in the form of a Latin phrase, and must be grammatically correct Latin. If the second part, the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] (or the third part, the [[subspecific name]]) is [[adjective|adjectival]] in nature, its ending must agree in gender with the name of the genus. If it is a noun, or an arbitrary combination of letters, this does not apply.
* For instance, the generic name ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'' is masculine; in the name ''[[Equus africanus]]'' the specific name ''africanus'' is an adjective, and its ending follows the gender of the generic name.
* In ''[[Equus zebra]]'' the specific name ''zebra'' is a noun, it may not be "corrected" to "Equus zebrus".
* In ''[[Equus quagga burchellii]]'' the subspecific name ''burchellii'' is a noun in the genitive case ("of Burchell").

If a species is moved, therefore, the spelling of an ending may need to change. If ''Gryllus migratorius'' is moved to the genus ''[[Locusta]]'', it becomes ''[[Locusta migratoria]]''. Confusion over Latin grammar has led to many incorrectly formed names appearing in print. An automated search may fail to find all the variant spellings of a given name (e.g., the spellings ''atra'' and ''ater'' may refer to the same species).

Many laymen{{Who|date=March 2013}}, and some scientists{{Who|date=March 2013}}, object to continued adherence to this rule, especially those who work with [[butterflies]] and [[moths]]. This is for historical reasons. In [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]], [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnæus]] placed all butterflies in the genus ''[[Papilio]]'', which, after a few decades, contained thousands of species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de/zooweb/servlet/AnimalBase/list/taxa?x_opt=papil&amp;sorted_by=genus&amp;=search AnimalBase: List of all taxa, sorted by genus names, ''Papilio'']&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, the gender of ''Papilio'' was unclear, undecided, and disputed. Some authors regarded it as masculine, others as feminine. Linnæus knew this problem and avoided any statement. All his 250 specific names in the genus ''Papilio'' were either nouns, indeclinable adjectives, or adjectives ending in ''-is'' (which can be masculine or feminine but not neuter). He did not use a single adjective ending in ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um''. [[P. Brown]], [[Pieter Cramer|Cramer]], [[Johan Christian Fabricius|Fabricius]], [[Johann Kaspar Füssli|Fueßlin]], [[Johann August Ephraim Goeze|Goeze]], [[Nikolaus Poda von Neuhaus|Poda]] and [[Franz von Paula Schrank|Schrank]] regarded ''Papilio'' as masculine, [[Édouard Ménétries|Ménétriés]], [[Erik Pontoppidan|Pontoppidan]] and most modern authors as feminine. In ICZN Opinion 278 from 1954, it was regarded as masculine. In many cases lepidopterists would not change the ending of a name as used by the author who established a name. So we find for example ''[[Papilio fuscus]]'' or ''[[Papilio macilentus]]'', but also ''[[Papilio osmana]]'' and ''[[Papilio paradoxa]]''. Only in a few cases are both versions found in the Web (an example is ''[[Papilio multicaudatus]]'' and ''[[Papilio multicaudata]]''). This works also with other butterfly genera of which the gender is undisputed. ''[[Graphium (butterfly)|Graphium]]'' appears neuter, but only the inconsistent versions ''[[Graphium angolanus]]'' and ''[[Graphium mandarinus]]'' are used, while ''[[Graphium sandawanum]]'' can only be found with a neuter specific name. Likewise, pairs are more frequently found in genera of which the gender is not obvious: ''Delias castaneus'' and ''Delias gigantea'', ''Belenois albumaculatus'' and ''Belenois rubrosignata'', ''Mylothris arabicus'' and ''Mylothris ruandana''. Even in moths, such pairs occur: ''[[Xylophanes obscurus]]'' and ''[[Xylophanes turbata]]'', ''[[Manduca boliviana]]'' and ''[[Manduca caribbeus]]'', ''[[Sphinx caligineus]]'' and ''[[Sphinx formosana]]'', ''[[Macroglossum albolineata]]'' and ''[[Macroglossum vicinum]]''. It may also occur that a lepidopteran [[subspecies]] can have a different gender from the name of the [[species]], as for example in ''Papilio multicaudata pusillus'' Austin &amp; Emmel, 1998, and ''Papilio torquatus flavida'' Oberthür, 1879.

Written nomenclatural rules in zoology were compiled in various countries since the late 1830s, such as Merton's Rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.6.131.9 |title=The Merton Rules |first=JA |last=Allen |journal=Science |year=1897 |volume=6 |issue=131 |pages=9–19 |url=

Compiling "International Rules on Zoological Nomenclature" was first proposed in 1895 in Leiden (3rd International Congress for Zoology) and officially published in three languages in 1905 (French, English, German; only French was official).&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, R., Maehrenthal, F. von &amp; Stiles, C. W. 1905. Règles internationales de la nomenclature zoologique adoptées par les Congrès Internationaux de Zoologie. International Rules of Zoological Nomenclature. Internationale Regeln der Zoologischen Nomenklatur. - Paris (Rudeval)&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, amendments and modifications were subsequently passed by various [[International Congress of Zoology|zoological congresses]] (Boston 1907, Graz 1910, Monaco 1913, Budapest 1927, Padua 1930, Paris 1948, Copenhagen 1953, and London 1958). These were only published in English, and can only be found in the reports of these congresses or other official publications.

The 1905 rules became increasingly outdated. They soon sold out, and it became increasingly difficult to obtain to a complete set of the Rules with all amendments.&lt;ref&gt;pp. V-VI in Kraus, O. 1962. Internationale Regeln für die Zoologische Nomenklatur. Beschlossen vom XV. Internationalen Kongress für Zoologie. - pp. I-VIII [= 1-8], 1-90. Frankfurt am Main. (Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft).&lt;/ref&gt; In Copenhagen 1953 the French and English texts of the rules were declared of equivalent official force, and a declaration was approved to prepare a new compilation of the rules. In 1958, an Editorial Committee in London elaborated a completely new version of the nomenclatural rules, which were finally published as the first edition of the ''ICZN Code'' on 9 November 1961.

The second edition of the code (only weakly modified) came in 1963. The last zoological congress to deal with nomenclatural problems took place in Monte Carlo 1972, since by then the official zoological organs no longer derived power from zoological congresses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Code Art. 77.2]&lt;/ref&gt; The third edition of the code came out in 1985. The present edition is the 4th edition, effective since 2000. These code editions were elaborated on by editorial committees&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Constitution Art. 16.2]&lt;/ref&gt; appointed by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]]. The ICZN Commission takes its power from a general biological congress (IUBS, [[International Union of Biological Sciences]]). The editorial committee for the fourth edition was composed of seven persons. Such new editions of the ICZN Code are not democratically approved by those taxonomists who are forced to follow the code's provisions, neither do taxonomists have the right to vote for the members of the commission or the editorial committee.

As the commission may alter the code (by declarations and amendments) without issuing a new edition of the book, the current edition does not necessarily contain the actual provision that applies in a particular case. The Code consists of the original text of the fourth edition and Declaration 44. The code is published in an English and a French&lt;ref&gt;[http://iczn.org/sites/iczn.org/files/Code%20International%20de%20Nomenclature%20Zoologique.pdf French Code online]&lt;/ref&gt; version; both versions are official and equivalent in force, meaning, and authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Code Art. 86.2]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that if something in the English code is unclear or its interpretation ambiguous, the French version is decisive, and if there is something unclear in the French code, the English version is decisive.

== Commission ==
The rules in the code apply to all users of zoological names. However, its provisions can be interpreted, waived, or modified in their application to a particular case when strict adherence would cause confusion. Such exceptions are not made by an individual scientist, no matter how well-respected within the field, but only by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]], acting on behalf of all zoologists. The commission takes such action in response to proposals submitted to it.

* [[Carl Linnaeus]] named the [[domestic cat]] ''Felis catus'' in 1758; [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] named the [[wildcat]] ''Felis silvestris'' in 1775. For taxonomists who consider these two kinds of cat a single species the [[principle of priority]] means that the species ought to be named ''F. catus'', but in practice almost all biologists have used ''F. silvestris''. In 2003, the commission issued a ruling ([[Opinion 2027]]) that "conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated, by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms", confirming ''F. silvestris'' for the wild cat. Taxonomists who consider the domesticated cat the same species as the wild cat should use ''F. silvestris''; taxonomists who consider the domesticated cat a subspecies of the wild cat should use ''F. silvestris catus''; taxonomists who consider the domesticated cat a separate species should use ''F. catus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=31 March 2003 |title=Opinion 2027 (Case 3010): Usage of 17 specific names based on wild species that are pre-dated by, or contemporary with, those based on domestic animals (Lepidoptera, Osteichthyes, Mammalia) |journal=Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature |volume=60 |issue=1 |publisher=[[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/iczn/BZNMar2003opinions.htm#opinion2027 |accessdate=8 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821235959/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/iczn/BZNMar2003opinions.htm |archivedate=21 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest amendments enacted by the commission concern electronic publishing, which is now permitted for works published under an [[ISBN]] or [[ISSN]] after 2011 in a way that ensures registration with [[ZooBank]] as well as archival of multiple copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature| doi = 10.3897/zookeys.219.3944 | title = Amendment of Articles 8, 9, 10, 21 and 78 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature to expand and refine methods of publication | journal = ZooKeys | volume = 219 | pages = 1–10| year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local usage and name changes==
The ICZN is used by the scientific community worldwide. Changes are governed by guidelines in the code.&lt;ref&gt;Scott L. Wing Causes and Consequences of Globally Warm Climates in the Early ... - 2003 No 369 - Page 288  "Following the general practice of naming species after localities by ending with "-ensis," Schnack (2000) proposed to change the name [[Discorbis duwi]] to Discorbis duwiensis. However, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Chapter 7 Article 32) does not allow such a change"&lt;/ref&gt; Local changes, such as the [[animal name changes in Turkey|changes proposed by the Turkish government]], are not recognised by ICZN.

The '''U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI)''', currently located in [[Walnut Creek, California]], was created in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in [[genome]] mapping, [[DNA sequencing]], technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the DOE genome centers at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (Berkeley Lab), [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL). Today, as a DOE Office of Science User Facility of Berkeley Lab, the JGI staff is composed of employees from Berkeley Lab, LLNL and the [http://hudsonalpha.org/ HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology]. The  JGI also collaborates with other national user facilities, such as the [https://www.emsl.pnl.gov/ Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory] at [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL), t[http://www.nersc.gov/ he National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, or NERSC], is a high performance computing (supercomputer) user facility operated by  Berkeley Lab, and the [https://genomicscience.energy.gov/centers/ DOE Bioenergy Research Centers].

In 2019 the JGI will move to the new [https://jgi.doe.gov/about-us/location/ Integrative Genomics Building], joining forces with the [https://kbase.us/ DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase)] on the Berkeley Lab main campus above the University of California, Berkeley. 

==History==
In 1999, the [[University of California]], which manages the three national labs for the DOE, leased laboratory and office space in a light industrial park in [[Walnut Creek, California]] to consolidate genome research activities. Led by biotechnology industry veteran [https://jgi.doe.gov/about-us/organization/strategic-management/nigel-mouncey/ Nigel Mouncey], who assumed the position of Director in March 2017, the DOE JGI receives its funding from the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in DOE's Office of Science.

Originally established to work on the [[Human Genome Project]]—the JGI generated the complete sequences of Chromosomes 5, 16 and 19—the JGI has since shifted its focus to the non-human components of the biosphere, particularly those relevant to the DOE's science mission. Since 2004, the JGI has been a user facility that advances genomics research in a broad range of disciplines where DNA sequence information is likely to drive scientific discoveries.

In February 2004, the JGI launched the Community Sequencing Program (CSP), now known as the [http://jgi.doe.gov/collaborate-with-jgi/community-science-program/ Community Science Program], which provides the scientific community at large with access to high-throughput, high-quality sequencing, DNA synthesis, metabolomics and analysis capabilities. The projects involve many important multicellular organisms, microbes and communities of microbes called [[metagenome]]s (or microbiomes) related to the DOE mission areas of [[bioenergy]], understanding global cycles such as the [[carbon cycle]], and [[biogeochemistry]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and are chosen primarily based on scientific merit as determined by outside review.

In 2017, the JGI had 1,598 active primary users worldwide and over active 8,000 data users.

==Genome sequencing milestones==

[https://jgi.doe.gov/our-science/science-programs/plant-genomics/plant-flagship-genomes/ Plant genomes] and fungal genomes that can inform the development of sustainable biofuels and bioproducts, and microorganisms such as those that thrive under extreme conditions such as high acidity, radiation and metal contamination are of particular interest to the DOE. Investigations by the JGI and its users are shedding light on plant biomass breakdown mechanisms and the cellular machinery of microbes and how they can be harnessed to clean up contaminated soil or water, capture carbon from the atmosphere and produce potentially important sources of energy such as hydrogen and methane.

In 2006, the JGI published the genome of the [http://jgi.doe.gov/news_9_14_06/ first tree sequenced]—the cottonwood ([[Populus|Populus trichocarpa]]). In partnership with other federal institutions and universities, the JGI has also published the genome sequences of sorghum; the microbial community in the termite hindgut, which could provide enzymes useful to biofuel production; microbes such as the bacteria ''Desulfovibrio'' that clean up sites contaminated with radioactive or toxic compounds; and algae involved in the global carbon cycle.

In 2009, the  JGI reached a sequencing capacity milestone, generated more than a trillion bases generated annually. In 2011, the JGI generated nearly 30 Terabases of sequence and in 2018, the JGI [http://jgi.doe.gov/our-projects/statistics/ will generate more than 200 Tb of sequence]. The JGI makes the high-quality data from genome sequencing, DNA synthesis, and metabolomics freely available to the greater scientific community on its website and on other public databases.

==Data management systems==

The JGI also supports programs dedicated to functional and evolutionary genomics related to the organisms and environments being sequenced and the development of computational and bioinformatic tools for data management and mining. These genome and metagenome/microbiome analysis systems include [http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/ Genome Portal], [http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/ Phytozome], [http://img.jgi.doe.gov/ IMG] and the Genomes OnLine Database.

The [[Integrated Microbial Genomes System]] (IMG), which provides a framework for comparative analysis of primarily microbial genomes, though the system also supports eukaryotic genomes and environmental samples. Its goal is to facilitate the visualization and exploration of genomes from a functional and evolutionary perspective.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9862">'''Kinetic exchange models''' are multi-agent dynamic models inspired by the [[statistical physics]] of energy distribution, which try to explain the robust and universal features of income/wealth distributions.

Understanding the [[Distribution of wealth|distributions]] of [[income]] and [[wealth]] in an [[economy]] has been a classic problem in [[economics]] for more than a hundred years. Today it is one of the main branches of [[econophysics]].

==Data and basic tools==
In 1897, [[Vilfredo Pareto]] first found a universal feature in the [[distribution of wealth]]. After that, with some notable exceptions, this field had been dormant for many decades, although accurate data had been accumulated over this period.
Considerable investigations with the real data during the last fifteen years (1995–2010) revealed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chatterjee |first1=A. |last2=Yarlagadda |first2=S. |last3=Chakrabarti |first3=B.K. |title=Econophysics of Wealth Distributions  |publisher= Springer-Verlag (Milan) |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the tail (typically 5 to 10 percent of agents in any country) of the [[income]]/[[wealth]] distribution indeed follows a [[power law]]. However, the majority of the population (i.e., the low-income population) follows a different distribution which is debated to be either [[Gibbs sampling|Gibbs]]
or [[log-normal]].

Basic tools used in this type of modelling are [[Probability|probabilistic]] and [[Statistics|statistical]] methods mostly taken from the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of [[statistical physics]]. [[Monte Carlo simulations]] often come handy in solving these models.

==Overview of the models==
Since the distributions of income/wealth are the results of the interaction among many heterogeneous [[Agent (economics)|agents]], there is an analogy with [[statistical mechanics]], where many particles interact. This similarity was noted by [[Meghnad Saha]] and B. N. Srivastava in 1931&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saha |first1=M. |last2=Srivastava |first2=B.N.  |title=A Treatise on Heat |publisher=Indian Press (Allahabad) |year=1931 |page=105}} (the page is reproduced in Fig. 6 in Sitabhra Sinha, [[Bikas K Chakrabarti]], [http://www.imsc.res.in/~sitabhra/papers/sinha_chakrabarti_physicsnews_09.pdf ''Towards a physics of economics''], Physics News 39(2) 33-46, April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and thirty years later by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mandelbrot |first=B.B. |title=The Pareto-Levy law and the distribution of income |journal=International Economic Review |volume=1 |pages=69 |year=1960 |doi=10.2307/2525289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, an elementary version of the stochastic exchange model was first proposed by J. Angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Angle |first=J. |title=The surplus theory of social stratification and the size distribution of personal wealth |journal=Social Forces |volume=65 |issue=2 |jstor=2578675 |doi=10.2307/2578675 |pages=293–326 |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of kinetic theory of gases, such an exchange model was first investigated by A. Dragulescu and V. Yakovenko.&lt;ref name="DragulescuYakovenko"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dragulescu |first1=A. |last2=Yakovenko |first2=V. |title=The statistical mechanics of money |journal=European Physical Journal B  |volume=17 |year=2000 |pages=723–729 |doi=10.1007/s100510070114|arxiv=cond-mat/0001432 |bibcode=2000EPJB...17..723D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garibaldi |first1=U. |last2=Scalas |first2=E. |last3=Viarenga |first3=P. |title=Statistical equilibrium in exchange games |journal=European Physical Journal B |volume=60 |pages=241–246 |year=2007 |work= |doi=10.1140/epjb/e2007-00338-5|bibcode=2007EPJB...60..241G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main modelling effort has been put to introduce the concepts of [[savings]],&lt;ref name="ChakrabortiChakrabarti"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chakraborti |first1=A. |last2=Chakrabarti |first2=B.K. |title= Statistical mechanics of money: how savings propensity affects its distribution |journal=European Physical Journal B |volume=17 |pages=167–170 |year=2000 |doi=10.1007/s100510070173|arxiv=cond-mat/0004256 |bibcode=2000EPJB...17..167C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCM"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chatterjee |first1=A. |last2=Chakrabarti |first2=B.K. |last3=Manna |first3=K.S.S. |title=Pareto law in a kinetic model of market with random saving propensity |journal=Physica A |volume=335 |pages=155–163 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.physa.2003.11.014|arxiv=cond-mat/0301289 |bibcode=2004PhyA..335..155C }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[taxation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guala |first1=S. |title=Taxes in a simple wealth distribution model by inelastically scattering particles |journal=Interdisciplinary description of complex systems |volume=7 | issue = 1  |pages=1–7 |year=2009|work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the setting of an [[ideal gas]]-like system. Basically, it assumes that in the short-run, an economy remains conserved in terms of income/wealth; therefore ''[[law of conservation]]'' for income/wealth can be applied. Millions of such conservative transactions lead to a steady state distribution of money ([[gamma function]]-like in the ''Chakraborti-Chakrabarti'' model with uniform savings,&lt;ref name="ChakrabortiChakrabarti"/&gt; and a gamma-like bulk distribution ending with a [[Pareto tail]]&lt;ref name="ChakrabortiPatriarca"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chakraborti |first=A. |last2=Patriarca |first2=M. |title= Variational Principle for the Pareto Power Law | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.228701 |journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=103 |pages=228701 |year=2009 |bibcode=2009PhRvL.103v8701C |pmid=20366128|arxiv=cond-mat/0605325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Chatterjee-Chakrabarti-Manna'' model with distributed savings&lt;ref name="CCM"/&gt;) and the distribution converges to it. The distributions derived thus have close resemblance with those found in [[empirical]] cases of income/wealth distributions.

Though this theory has been originally derived from the [[entropy maximization]] principle of [[statistical mechanics]], it has recently been shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A. S. Chakrabarti |author2=B. K. Chakrabarti |title=Microeconomics of the ideal gas like market models |journal=Physica A |volume=388 |pages=4151–4158 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.physa.2009.06.038|arxiv=0905.3972 |bibcode=2009PhyA..388.4151C }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the same could be derived from the [[utility maximization]] principle as well, following a standard exchange-model with [[Cobb-Douglas]] [[utility function]]. The exact distributions produced by this class of kinetic models are known only in certain limits and extensive investigations have been made on the mathematical structures of this class of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=During |first1=B. |last2=Matthes |first2=D. |last3=Toscani |first3=G. |title=Kinetic equations modelling wealth distributions: a comparison of approaches |journal=Physical Review E |volume=78 |pages=056103 |year=2008 |doi=10.1103/physreve.78.056103|bibcode=2008PhRvE..78e6103D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cordier | first1=S. |last2=Pareschi |first2=L. |last3=Toscani |first3=G. |title=On a kinetic model for a simple market economy |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=120 |pages=253–277 |year=2005 |doi=10.1007/s10955-005-5456-0|arxiv=math/0412429 |bibcode=2005JSP...120..253C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The general forms have not been derived so far.

==Criticisms==
This class of models has attracted criticisms from many dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Mauro Gallegati]], [[Steve Keen]], [[Thomas Lux]] and [[Paul Ormerod]] |title= Worrying Trends in Econophysics|journal=Physica A |volume=371 |pages=1–6 |year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.physa.2006.04.029|bibcode=2006PhyA..370....1G}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been debated for long whether the distributions derived from these models are representing the income distributions or wealth distributions. The ''[[law of conservation]]'' for income/wealth has also been a subject of criticism.

An animal with the [[conservation status]] of '''lower risk''' is one with populations levels high enough to ensure its survival. Animals with this status do not qualify as being threatened or extinct, however, natural disasters or certain human activities would cause them to change to either of these classifications.

This classification is sub-divided into three types:
*[[Conservation dependent]] - where cessation of current conservation measures could result in it being classified at a higher risk level.
*[[Near threatened]] - close to becoming [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] but not meeting the criteria.
*[[Least concern]] - where neither of the two above apply.

'''Metasilicic acid''' is the name given to the hypothetical [[chemical compound]] with formula {{chem|H|2|SiO|3}}. It has never been be isolated. It is possible that it may exist in aqueous solution at very low concentration, but it has never been definitively characterized. It may be present in dilute solutions of [[sodium silicate]] at low pH.&lt;ref name=bech&gt;M. F. Bechtold (1955): "Polymerization and Properties of Dilute Aqueous Silicic Acid from Cation Exchange"  ''Journal of Physical Chemistry'',  volume 59, issue 6, pages 532–541. {{doi|10.1021/j150528a013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metasilicate]]s occur widely in nature as [[inosilicate]]s.

The '''missing baryon problem''' was a problem related to the fact that the observed amount of [[baryon|baryonic matter]] did not match theoretical predictions. The density of baryons can be constrained according to [[big bang nucleosynthesis]] and the [[cosmic microwave background]]. The best current data, observed by the [[Planck spacecraft]] in 2015, yielded a density about 4.85% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="Planck15"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ade et al.|first1=P.A.R.|title=Planck 2015 results. XIII. Cosmological parameters|journal=Astron. Astrophys.|date=2015|volume=594|page=A13|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201525830|bibcode=2016A&amp;A...594A..13P|arxiv = 1502.01589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, directly adding up all the known baryonic matter produces a baryonic density slightly less than half of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://archive.stsci.edu/hut/astro2/astro2_science/starburst.html|title="The Case of the "Missing Baryons""|author=Henry C. Ferguson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The missing baryon problem is distinct from the [[dark matter]] problem, which is mainly non-baryonic in nature. There is also much more dark matter in the universe than there are missing baryons.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lambda-CDM model]]. Baryons make up only ~5% of the universe, while dark matter makes up 26.8%.&lt;/ref&gt;

The missing baryon problem was proclaimed solved in October 2017, with the missing baryons located in the [[Warm–hot intergalactic medium|warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM)]] (hot intergalactic gas).&lt;ref name="New Scientist"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2149742-half-the-universes-missing-matter-has-just-been-finally-found/|title=Half the universe’s missing matter has just been finally found|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical predictions==
The density of baryonic matter can be obtained indirectly from two independent methods.

* The theory of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predicts the observed [[abundance of the chemical elements]]. If there are more baryons, then there should also be more helium, lithium and heavier elements synthesized during the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;Achim Weiss, "[http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/BBN Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Cooking up the first light elements]" in: Einstein Online Vol. 2 (2006), 1017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raine |first=D. |last2=Thomas |first2=T. |date=2001 |title=An Introduction to the Science of Cosmology |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/55748578/An-Introduction-to-the-Science-of-Cosmology |page=30 |publisher=[[IOP Publishing]] |isbn=0-7503-0405-7 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530073650/http://www.scribd.com/doc/55748578/An-Introduction-to-the-Science-of-Cosmology |archivedate=30 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement with observed abundances requires that baryonic matter makes up between 4–5% of the universe's [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]].
* Detailed analysis of the small irregularities (anisotropies) in the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB), especially the second peak. The details are technical, but are based on the fact that baryonic matter interacts with photons and therefore leaves a visible imprint on the CMB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=L. |last=Canetti |first2=M. |last2=Drewes |first3=M. |last3=Shaposhnikov |title=Matter and Antimatter in the Universe |journal=New J. Phys. |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=095012 |doi=10.1088/1367-2630/14/9/095012 |arxiv = 1204.4186 |bibcode = 2012NJPh...14i5012C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CMB constraint (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_b h^2 = 0.02230 \pm 0.00014&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref name="Planck15" /&gt; is much more precise than the BBN constraint (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_b h^2 = 0.023 \pm 0.002&lt;/math&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~komatsu/lecturenotes/Mike_Anderson_on_missing_baryons.pdf|title=Missing Baryons|author=Mike Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1412.1408|last1=Fields|first1=Brian D|title=Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis|journal=Chinese Physics C|volume=38|issue=9|pages=339–344|last2=Molaro|first2=Paolo|last3=Sarkar|first3=Subir|year=2014|doi=10.1088/1674-1137/38/9/090001|bibcode=2014ChPhC..38i0001O}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the two are in agreement.

==Observations==
The density of baryonic matter can be obtained directly by summing up all the known baryonic matter. This is highly nontrivial, since although luminous matter such as stars and galaxies are easily summed, baryonic matter can also exist in highly non-luminous form, such as [[black holes]], [[planets]], and highly diffuse [[interstellar gas]]. Nonetheless it can still be done, using techniques such as:

* Sufficient diffuse, baryonic gas or dust would be visible when backlit by stars. The resulting spectra can be used to infer the mass between the star and the observer (us).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lyman-alpha forest]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gravitational microlensing]]. If a planet or other dark object moves between the observer and a faraway source, the image of the source is distorted. The mass of the dark object can be inferred based on the amount of distortion.

Prior to 2017, the result came to about 70% of the theoretical predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1112.2706 |bibcode=2012ApJ...759...23S |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/759/1/23 |title=The Baryon Census in a Multiphase Intergalactic Medium: 30% of the Baryons May Still be Missing|journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=759 |pages=23 |year=2012 |last1=Shull |first1=J. Michael |last2=Smith |first2=Britton D |last3=Danforth |first3=Charles W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
The missing baryon problem was proclaimed solved in 2017, when two groups of scientists working independently found the missing baryons in intergalactic matter. The missing baryons had been postulated to exist as hot strands between galaxy pairs. Because the strands are so diffuse, and because they are not hot enough to emit X-rays, they are difficult to detect. The groups used the [[Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect]] to measure the density of the strands. If there are baryons present, light from the cosmic microwave background should scatter off them, losing some energy. These show up as very dim patches in the CMB. The patches are too dim to see directly, but when overlaid with the visible galaxy distribution, become detectable. The density of the strands comes up to about 30% of the baryonic density, the exact amount needed to solve the problem.&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1709.05024|last1=Tanimura|first1=Hideki|title=A Search for Warm/Hot Gas Filaments Between Pairs of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies|last2=Hinshaw|first2=Gary|last3=McCarthy|first3=Ian G|author4=Ludovic Van Waerbeke|last5=Ma|first5=Yin-Zhe|last6=Mead|first6=Alexander|last7=Hojjati|first7=Alireza|last8=Tröster|first8=Tilman|class=astro-ph.CO|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1709.10378|author1=Anna de Graaff|title=Missing baryons in the cosmic web revealed by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect|last2=Cai|first2=Yan-Chuan|last3=Heymans|first3=Catherine|last4=Peacock|first4=John A|class=astro-ph.CO|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nicastro|first=F.|last2=Kaastra|first2=J.|last3=Krongold|first3=Y.|last4=Borgani|first4=S.|last5=Branchini|first5=E.|last6=Cen|first6=R.|last7=Dadina|first7=M.|last8=Danforth|first8=C.

'''MusicWriter''' was founded in 1989 by music industry veterans [[Jon Monday]] and Larry Heller to develop and market NoteStation, a kiosk-based retail "point-of-sale manufacturing" system for the distribution and printing of [[sheet music]]. Besides having a very large library of songs across all music genres, the NoteStation was able to print the [[sheet music]] on demand in any key, as selected by the customer. This reduced the need for retailers to carry a large selection of physical inventory, which was usually only printed in one key.

Early in the MusicWriter's history [[Warner Bros.]] Music and [[Thorn EMI]], the two largest music publishers in the world, invested in the company and became board members. The company then was able to sign most of the major music publishers to offer their titles through the system.

MusicWriter was among the first applications of the new distribution paradigm of "Mass Customization" or "Point-of-Sale Manufacturing", where a retailer is able to offer a very large selection of a product, with virtually no inventory, and manufacture the customized product on the spot for a customer. This trend was documented in B. Joseph Pine II’s 1993 book, ''Mass Customization, The New Frontier in Business Competition'' published by Harvard Business School Press.

The company expanded its features to include producing [[MIDI]] files on demand and online ordering of music products from distributors.{{ref|Article1}}

The company was featured on CNN TV and written about in Fortune Magazine, Business Week, USA Today, San Francisco Examiner, San Jose Mercury News, and Popular Science.

Due to the major print music companies that fought against the technologies, in 1999 MusicWriter went bankrupt as online technology emerged and the decline of [[sheet music]] retailers made the in-store technology obsolete. However, years later online versions of the technology were introduced by other companies, such as SheetMusicDirect.com, MusicNotes.com, and SheetMusicPlus.com.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7714">[[File:2-Dice-Icon.svg|frameless|right|alt=Two dice]]
A '''''{{Lang|de|Musikalisches Würfelspiel}}''''' (German for "musical dice game") was a system for using [[dice]] to randomly '[[generative music|generate]]' [[music]] from [[music composition|precomposed]] options. These 'games' were quite popular throughout Western Europe in the 18th century. Several different [[game]]s were devised, some that did not require dice, but merely 'choosing a [[random]] [[number]].'

The earliest example is [[Johann Philipp Kirnberger]]'s ''{{Lang|de|Der allezeit fertige Menuetten- und Polonaisencomponist}}'' (German for "The Ever-Ready Minuet and Polonaise Composer") (1757 [1st edition; revised 2nd 1783]).&lt;ref name="Algorithmic"&gt;Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). ''Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation'', pp. 36 &amp; 38n7. {{ISBN|9783211755396}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples by well known composers include [[C. P. E. Bach]]'s ''{{Lang|de|Einfall, einen doppelten Contrapunct in der Octave von sechs Tacten zu machen, ohne die Regeln davon zu wissen}}'' (German for "A method for making six bars of double counterpoint at the octave without knowing the rules") (1758) and [[Maximilian Stadler]]'s ''{{Lang|fr|Table pour composer des minuets et des Trios à la infinie; avec deux dez à jouer}}'' (French for "A table for composing minuets and trios to infinity, by playing with two dice") (1780).&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;

In the early 20th century the Kaleidacousticon System, using arbitrarily combinable [[playing card]]s, was unsuccessfully marketed in the Boston area as a [[parlour game]].&lt;ref&gt;Nierhaus (2009), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
According to Lawrence Zbikowski, "In truth, chance played little part in the success of the music produced by such games. Instead, what was required of the compilers...[was] a little knowledge about how to put the game together and an understanding of the formal design of waltzes, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Zbikowski, Lawrence M. (2002). ''Conceptualizing Music: Cognitive Structure, Theory, and Analysis'', pp. 142–143. {{ISBN|9780195187977}}. Quoted in Berkowitz, Aaron (2010). ''The Improvising Mind: Cognition and Creativity in the Musical Moment'', p. 65. {{ISBN|9780199590957}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stephen Hedges, "The 'galant' middle class in Europe was playing with mathematics. In this atmosphere of investigation and cataloguing, a systematic device that would seem to make it possible for anyone to write music was practically guaranteed popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Stephen A. (1978). "Dice Music in the Eighteenth Century", pp. 184–185, ''Music and Letters 59'': 180–87. Quoted in Berkowitz (2010), p. 65n60.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Leonard Meyer]], "Eighteenth-century composers constructed musical dice games while nineteenth century composers did not. ... [W]hat constrained the choice of figures [in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century music] were the claims of taste, coherent expression and propriety, given the genre of work being composed, rather than the inner necessity of a gradually unfolding, underlying process [as in nineteenth century music]".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Leonard (1989). ''Style and Music: Theory, History, and Ideology'', p. 193. {{ISBN|9780226521527}}.&lt;/ref&gt; See: [[musical development]].

The way these games work may be understood in analogy to [[generative grammar|sentence construction]].
 1 The cow   ran    past    the field.
 2 The pig   walked through the yard.
 3 The sheep ran    into    the marsh.
One rolls one&lt;!--three sided--&gt; die for each word and selects the word from the appropriate column according to the number. Thus if one rolls 1 2 3 1 2 3 one is given, "The pig ran past the marsh." Each progression is essentially the same, there may be more or less choices for different slots, and the choices offered for each slot are slight [[variation (music)|variations]] rather than being entirely different.

== Alleged musikalisches Würfelspiel ==

The most well-known was published in 1792, by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s publisher [[Nikolaus Simrock]] in Berlin ([[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 294d or K. Anh. C 30.01). The game was attributed to Mozart, but this attribution has not been authenticated.&lt;ref&gt;Cope, David (1996). ''Experiments in Musical Intelligence'', p. 7. Madison, Wisconsin: A–R Editions, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0895793379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The dice rolls randomly selected small sections of music, which would be patched together to create a musical piece. This game is capable of producing 11&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;45,949,729,863,572,161 different yet similar waltzes.&lt;ref&gt;Zbikowski (2002), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Some measures have only one possibility no matter what the roll of the dice (measure 8/16) while other measures have a different possibility for each roll (measure 1/16).&lt;ref&gt;Berkowitz (2010), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozart's manuscript K. 516f, written in 1787, consisting of numerous two-[[bar (music)|bar]] fragments of music, appears to be some kind of game or system for constructing music out of two-bar fragments, but contains no instructions and there is no evidence that dice were involved.

The titles of the supposed Mozart compositions are:&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;
*''{{Lang|de|Anleitung zum Componieren von Walzern so viele man will vermittelst zweier Würfel, ohne etwas von der Musik oder Composition zu verstehen}}'' (German for "Instructions for the composition of as many waltzes as one desires with two dice, without understanding anything about music or composition")
*''{{Lang|de|Anleitung zum Componieren von Polonaisen...}}'' (German for "Instructions for the composition of polonaises...")

[[Robert Xavier Rodríguez]] composed his ''Musical Dice Game'' for string orchestra based on K. 516f.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.schirmer.com/default.aspx?tabid=2420&amp;state_2874=2&amp;workid_2874=25473 Robert Xavier Rodríguez: Musical Dice Game]", Schirmer.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attribution of [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''{{Lang|it|Gioco filarmonico o sia maniera facile per comporre un infinito numero de minuetti e trio anche senza sapere il contrappunto}}'' (Italian for "The game of harmony, or an easy method for composing an infinite number of minuet-trios, without any knowledge of counterpoint") has also not been authenticated.&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;

'''Narec''', since 2014 known as the '''National Renewable Energy Centre''', is a part of the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) [[Catapult centres|Catapult]], a British technology innovation and research centre for [[offshore wind power]], [[Wave power|wave energy]], [[tidal power|tidal energy]] and [[low carbon]] technologies. ORE Catapult's head office is in Glasgow, Scotland. The centre operates multi-purpose offshore renewable energy test and demonstration facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Test &amp; Demonstration assets – Catapult|url = https://ore.catapult.org.uk/testing|website = ore.catapult.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to other centres, such as [[NREL]] in the US&lt;ref&gt;http://www.narec.co.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216002837/http://www.narec.co.uk/ |date=16 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Centre for Renewable Energies (CENER)]] in Spain. The National Renewable Energy Centre is based in [[Blyth, Northumberland]].

==History==

Originally known as NaREC (New and Renewable Energy Centre), the centre was created in 2002 by [[One NorthEast]], the North East [[regional development agency]], as part of the ''Strategy for Success'' programme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strategyforsuccess.info/page/news/article.cfm?articleId=1400&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the organisation changed its name to Narec (National Renewable Energy Centre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companiesintheuk.co.uk/ltd/national-renewable-energy-centre|title=OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY CATAPULT|work=CompaniesInTheUK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the organisation merged with the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult to focus on the development and cost reduction of offshore wind, wave and tidal energy across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ORE Catapult and Narec merge|url = http://renews.biz/64303/ore-catapult-narec-link-ships|website = reNEWS – Renewable Energy News|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Narec to merge with Glasgow’s Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult|url = http://www.thejournal.co.uk/business/business-news/narec-merge-glasgows-offshore-renewable-6917321|website = journallive|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was originally involved in a wide range of technologies, including:
* Wind (onshore and offshore)
* Transmission and distribution
* Photovoltaics
* Oil and gas
* Marine renewables
* Fuel cells
* Microrenewables
* Biomass&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narec.co.uk/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216002837/http://www.narec.co.uk/|title=Welcome to NaREC|archivedate=16 February 2008|work=narec.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, due to UK government cutbacks, Narec closed, sold off or separated parts of the business. Now, Narec itself concentrates on testing blades and drive trains for marine renewables. Spin-off companies include:

'''Narec Distributed Energy''' – An organisation which deals with microrenewables, energy efficiency, low carbon transport and citywide energy planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narecde.co.uk|title=Narec Distributed Energy – National Renewable Energy Centre Group|work=Narec Distributed Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narec Distributed Energy is 100% owned by Narec.

'''Solar''' '''Capture Technologies''' – 8% owned by Narec, and 92% owned by the Swedish firm Absolicon. This organisation is focused on silicon photovoltaic cells.&lt;ref name="wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/57f66c2d0af5abf81b3aeaaf94e518dc/compdetails|title=Failure Page|work=companieshouse.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narecsolar.com|title=Solar Capture Technologies – Home – Solar Capture Technologies|work=Solar Capture Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolicon.com/narec-solar-spun-out/|title=Narec Solar Spun Out|work=absolicon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narec Capital''' – A financial organisation run by Narec and Ashberg Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nebusiness.co.uk/business-news/latest-business-news/2011/07/04/narec-capital-looking-to-raise-300m-of-funding-51140-28987729/|title=Narec Capital looking to raise £300m of funding|author=journallive Administrator|date=4 July 2011|work=journallive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narec Capital Risk Solutions''' – Beyond its existence, there is very little information on what this organisation does.&lt;ref name="wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk"/&gt;

Following its merger with ORE Catapult, the National Renewable Energy Centre now focuses on helping to de-risk and accelerate the development and commercialisation of the offshore renewable energy industry in the UK.

Although one of the few high voltage testing facilities in the world,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} the facility was closed by Narec in 2011 due to a lack of government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/business/latest-news/plug_could_be_pulled_on_testing_lab_1_3230372|title=Plug could be pulled on testing lab|work=shieldsgazette.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many parts of the lab were relocated to Narec's main campus in Blyth. The ruins of the original lab are now the property of [[Siemens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/02/urban-explorers-highlight-decay-highest-voltage-lab-world|title=Urban explorers highlight the decay of the highest voltage lab in the world|work=newstatesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current facilities==

===Charles Parsons Technology Centre===

Built in 2004, this £5m facility contains a low voltage electrical laboratory for the testing of connecting renewable energy systems to the transmission and distribution grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onenortheast.co.uk/page/news/article.cfm?articleId=685%7ctitle=onenortheast.co.uk%7cwork=onenortheast.co.uk|title=onenortheast.co.uk|work=onenortheast.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the equipment and staff from the closed Narec Clothier Electrical Testing Laboratory were moved to this facility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.narec.co.uk/electrical_networks_info/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training tower===

This is a 27m high tower, for training of offshore wind technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/8202/narecs-wind-turbine-training-tower-ready-for-use/|title=Narec’s wind turbine training tower ready for use|author=Elsevier Ltd, The Boulevard, Langford Lane, Kidlington, Oxford, OX5 1GB, United Kingdom|work=renewableenergyfocus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software is designed flexibly to perform a wide range of basic, large-scale genetic analyses.

PLINK currently supports following functionalities:
* data management;
* basic statistics;
* [[Linkage disequilibrium]] (LD) calculation;
* [[Identity by descent]] (IBD) and [[identity by state]] (IBS) matrix calculation;
* [[population stratification]];
* association analysis such as [[Genome-wide association study]] for both basic case/control studies and quantitative traits.

==Extensions and current developments==
* PLINK 2.0 a comprehensive update to PLINK, developed by Christopher Chang, with the improved speed of various Genome-wide association (GWA) calculations, including identity-by-state (IBS) matrix calculation, LD-based pruning and association analysis. 
* PLINK/SEQ is an open-source C/C++ library designed for analyzing large scale whole-genome and whole-exome studies.  
* MQFAM is a multivariate test of association (MQFAM) that can be efficiently applied to large population-based samples and is implemented in PLINK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2243">In [[probability theory]], to '''postselect''' is to [[Conditional probability|condition]] a [[probability space]] upon the occurrence of a given event. In symbols, once we postselect for an event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, the probability of some other event &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; changes from &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Pr[F]&lt;/math&gt; to the [[conditional probability]] &lt;math&gt;Pr[F\, |\, E]&lt;/math&gt;.

For a [[Discrete probability distribution|discrete probability space]], &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Pr[F\, |\, E] = \frac{Pr[F \, \cap \, E]}{Pr[E]}&lt;/math&gt;, and thus we require that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Pr[E]&lt;/math&gt; be strictly positive in order for the postselection to be well-defined.

See also [[PostBQP]], a complexity class defined with postselection. Using postselection it seems [[quantum Turing machine]]s are much more powerful: [[Scott Aaronson]] proved&lt;ref name="PostBQP = PP"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|year=2005|title=Quantum computing, postselection, and probabilistic polynomial-time|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |volume=461|issue=2063|pages=3473–3482|doi=10.1098/rspa.2005.1546|arxiv=quant-ph/0412187|bibcode=2005RSPSA.461.3473A}}.  Preprint available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0412187]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblog.fortnow.com/2004/01/complexity-class-of-week-pp-by-guest.html|title=Complexity Class of the Week: PP|last=Aaronson|first=Scott|date=2004-01-11|work=Computational Complexity Weblog|accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''PostBQP''' is equal to '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]'''.

Some quantum experiments&lt;ref name="Hensen et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hensen|title=Loophole-free Bell inequality violation using electron spins separated by 1.3 kilometres|journal=Nature|volume=526|pages=682–686|doi=10.1038/nature15759|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7575/full/nature15759.html|display-authors=etal|pmid=26503041|arxiv=1508.05949|bibcode=2015Natur.526..682H}}&lt;/ref&gt; use post-selection after the experiment as a replacement for communication during the experiment, by post-selecting the communicated value into a constant.

A '''protected area mosaic''', or '''conservation mosaic''' is a collection of environmentally protected areas that are treated as a whole, either formally or informally.
The protected areas may be of different types, including strictly protected areas and sustainable use areas, which may be administered at different public levels or privately.
They may include areas assigned to indigenous people.
A mosaic may be more flexible and effective than an attempt to combine all the areas into a single conservation unit under one agency.
In practice, results with mosaics in different countries have been mixed.

==Definition==

A conservation mosaic may be defined as "a network of protected areas and complementary landscapes that include combinations of national parks (i.e. the core conservation areas), production landscapes and collectively-owned ethnic territories (i.e. the surrounding areas)".{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=x}}
Conservation mosaics are similar to the [[biosphere]]s promoted by [[UNESCO]] under the [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]].{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=4}}
The cooperative approach between different agencies and types of protected area avoids the conflicts and disagreements over land use and conservation that often result with a single agency and single type of conservation unit.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=247}}
The value of creating protected area mosaics has been the subject of intense debate among conservationists.{{sfn|Conservation International|2009|p=21}}
Protected areas are of great importance in protecting biodiversity, but conservation efforts must take into account the social and economic needs of the surrounding communities and the resulting pressure on land usage.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|pp=x–xi}}

==National examples==

===Brazil===
[[File:Amazonas BR-319.jpg|thumb|[[BR-319]]. A protected area mosaic has been defined in an effort to reduce deforestation when the road is paved.]]
{{main article|Protected area mosaic (Brazil)}}
A ''[[Protected area mosaic (Brazil)|mosaico de unidades de conservação]]'' is a legally recognized entity in Brazil, a collection of protected areas of the same or different categories that are near to each other, adjoin each other or overlap, and that should be managed as a whole. It may include conservation units, private lands and indigenous territories.{{sfn|Mosaicos de áreas protegidas – ISA}}
Brazil has created a mosaic of federal and state conservation units along the [[BR-319]] highway through the Amazon rainforest in an effort to better prevent deforestation when the highway is paved through more efficient management of a larger area. 
However, WWF-Brazil has pointed out that it is not enough to simply create the protected areas on paper. 
They must be staffed, delimited, legal owners compensated and so on.{{sfn|Six new protected areas created in Brazilian Amazonian state}}

The [[Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park]] in the state of [[Goiás]], Brazil, was expanded by Federal Decree in September 2001 and inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in December 2001.
In 2003 the expansion was successfully challenged and 72% of the national park lost its protection status.
The park is part of the [[Cerrado Biosphere Reserve]].
Brazil has outlined plans for a mosaic of new conservation units with different management categories covering an equivalent area to the expanded National Park, but [[UNESCO]] has questioned whether the mosaic will be sufficient to ensure the statutory protection required for the World Heritage properties.{{sfn|Cerrado Protected Areas ... UNESCO}}

===Colombia===

A 2015 World Bank report on national protected areas in Colombia covering at least {{convert|2000000|ha}} found that with the mosaic approach ecological connectivity had improved in eight of the mosaics, exceeding the target.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=2}}
The local farmers and fishing communities in seven of the conservation mosaics, which included protected areas and their surrounding buffer zones, benefited from sustainable provision and use of
environmental goods and services.{{sfn|Caballero|Battaglini|Lagnaoui|2015|p=3}}

===Kenya===

In northern Kenya the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) organisation covers 19 community conservancies with more than {{convert|3000000|acre}} of wildlife habitat.  
The NRT Council of Elders agreed in May 2010 to found the  Nakuprat – Gotu Community Conservancy beside the [[Shaba National Reserve]] and the [[Ewaso Ng'iro]] river to promote conflict resolution and conserve nature.
The conservancy is part of a protected area mosaic that is a vital habitat for species that include the [[African elephant]] and the endangered [[Grévy's zebra]].{{sfn|Nakuprat Conservancy – Tusk}}

===United Kingdom===

A mosaic of protected areas has evolved in the United Kingdom, with a growing number of types of protected area, some as a result of European Union directives.
The objectives of nature conservation and landscape protection are treated as distinct.
The mosaic has evolved in a manner that results in duplication of effort and funding.
It could benefit from rationalisation and more flexible administration.{{sfn|Bishop|Phillips|Warren}}

===United States===

The protected area mosaics of the [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]], [[El Malpais National Monument|El Malpais]], [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro]] and [[Las Cienegas National Conservation Area|Las Cienegas]] areas in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona have been assembled by a variety of government and non-government organisations to protect the environment while respecting land use demands of the southwest of the United States.
This broad approach to ecosystem planning and management seems more fair and effective than former single-agency approaches.{{sfn|Nelson|2005|p=245}}
The Great Sand Dunes Monument Area combined various type of protected area to satisfy the objectives of the [[National Park Service]], [[The Nature Conservancy]] and other organizations, and to combine conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem.
The result was similar to the protected area mosaic recommended in the early 1980s for parts of the [[Yukon]] in Canada.
Implementation was staged, with many interactions and adaptations over time.{{sfn|Day|Nelson|Sportza|2003|p=142}}

{{Psychology sidebar}}
'''Psychometrics''' is a field of study concerned with the theory and technique of [[psychological]] [[measurement]]. As defined by the [[National Council on Measurement in Education]] (NCME), psychometrics refers to psychological measurement. Generally, it refers to the field in psychology and education that is devoted to testing, measurement, assessment, and related activities.&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorP {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorP |date=2017-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is concerned with the objective [[measurement]] of skills and knowledge, abilities, attitudes, [[Trait theory|personality traits]], and [[educational measurement|educational achievement]]. Some psychometric researchers focus on the construction and validation of assessment instruments such as [[questionnaire]]s, [[test (student assessment)|tests]], raters' judgments, and [[personality tests]]. Others focus on research relating to measurement theory (e.g., [[item response theory]]; [[intraclass correlation]]).

Practitioners are described as psychometricians. Psychometricians usually possess a specific qualification, and most are [[psychologists]] with advanced graduate training. In addition to traditional academic institutions, many psychometricians work for the government or in [[human resources]] departments. Others specialize as [[learning and development]] professionals.

== Historical foundation ==

Psychological testing has come from two streams of thought: the first, from [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Sir Francis Galton|Galton]], and [[James McKeen Cattell|Cattell]] on the measurement of individual differences, and the second, from [[J.E. Herbart|Herbart]], [[E.H. Weber|Weber]], [[Gustav Fechner|Fechner]], and [[Wundt]] and their psychophysical measurements of a similar construct. The second set of individuals and their research is what has led to the development of [[experimental psychology]], and standardized testing.&lt;ref name="Kaplan, R.M. 2010"&gt;Kaplan, R.M., &amp; Saccuzzo, D.P. (2010). ''Psychological Testing: Principles, Applications, and Issues.'' (8th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victorian stream ===

Charles Darwin was the inspiration behind Sir Francis Galton who led to the creation of psychometrics. In 1859, Darwin published his book "[[The Origin of Species]]", which pertained to individual differences in animals. This book discussed how individual members in a [[species]] differ and how they possess characteristics that are more adaptive and successful or less adaptive and less successful. Those who are adaptive and successful are the ones that survive and give way to the next generation, who would be just as or more adaptive and successful. This idea, studied previously in animals, led to Galton's interest and study of human beings and how they differ one from another, and more importantly, how to measure those differences.

Galton wrote a book entitled "Hereditary Genius" about different characteristics that people possess and how those characteristics make them more "fit" than others. Today these differences, such as sensory and motor functioning (reaction time, visual acuity, and physical strength) are important domains of scientific psychology. Much of the early theoretical and applied work in psychometrics was undertaken in an attempt to measure [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]]. Galton, often referred to as "the father of psychometrics," devised and included mental tests among his [[anthropometric]] measures. James McKeen Cattell, who is considered a pioneer of psychometrics went on to extend Galton's work. Cattell also coined the term ''mental test'', and is responsible for the research and knowledge which ultimately led to the development of modern tests. (Kaplan &amp; Saccuzzo, 2010)

=== German stream ===

The origin of psychometrics also has connections to the related field of [[psychophysics]]. Around the same time that Darwin, Galton, and Cattell were making their discoveries, Herbart was also interested in "unlocking the mysteries of human consciousness" through the scientific method. (Kaplan &amp; Saccuzzo, 2010) Herbart was responsible for creating mathematical models of the mind, which were influential in educational practices in years to come.

E.H. Weber built upon Herbart's work and tried to prove the existence of a psychological threshold, saying that a minimum stimulus was necessary to activate a sensory system. After Weber, G.T. Fechner expanded upon the knowledge he gleaned from Herbart and Weber, to devise the law that the strength of a sensation grows as the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. A follower of Weber and Fechner, Wilhelm Wundt is credited with founding the science of psychology. It is Wundt's influence that paved the way for others to develop psychological testing.&lt;ref name="Kaplan, R.M. 2010" /&gt;

=== 20th century ===
The psychometrician [[L. L. Thurstone]], founder and first president of the Psychometric Society in 1936, developed and applied a theoretical approach to measurement referred to as the [[law of comparative judgment]], an approach that has close connections to the psychophysical theory of [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] and [[Gustav Fechner]]. In addition, Spearman and Thurstone both made important contributions to the theory and application of [[factor analysis]], a statistical method developed and used extensively in psychometrics.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In the late 1950s, [[Leopold Szondi]] made an historical and epistemological assessment of the impact of statistical thinking onto psychology during previous few decades: "in the last decades, the specifically psychological thinking has been almost completely suppressed and removed, and replaced by a statistical thinking. Precisely here we see the cancer of testology and testomania of today."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Szondi]] (1960) ''Das zweite Buch: Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik''. Huber, Bern und Stuttgart, 2nd edition. Ch.27, From the Spanish translation, B)II ''Las condiciones estadisticas'', p.396. Quotation: {{quotation|el pensamiento psicologico especifico, en las ultima decadas, fue suprimido y eliminado casi totalmente, siendo sustituido por un pensamiento estadistico. Precisamente aqui vemos el cáncer de la testología y testomania de hoy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, psychometric theory has been applied in the measurement of [[wikt:personality|personality]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and [[belief]]s, and [[academic achievement]].  Measurement of these unobservable phenomena is difficult, and much of the research and accumulated science in this discipline has been developed in an attempt to properly define and quantify such phenomena.  Critics, including practitioners in the [[physical sciences]] and [[Activism|social activists]], have argued that such definition and quantification is impossibly difficult, and that such measurements are often misused, such as with psychometric personality tests used in employment procedures:

: "For example, an employer wanting someone for a role requiring consistent attention to repetitive detail will probably not want to give that job to someone who is very creative and gets bored easily."&lt;ref&gt;Psychometric Assessments. ''[http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/careers/student/interviews/test.html Psychometric Assessments .]'' University of Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures who made significant contributions to psychometrics include [[Karl Pearson]], [[Henry F. Kaiser]], [[Carl Brigham]], [[L. L. Thurstone]], [[Anne Anastasi]], [[Georg Rasch]], [[Eugene Galanter]], [[Johnson O'Connor]], [[Frederic M. Lord]], [[Ledyard R Tucker]], [[Arthur Jensen]], and [[David Andrich]].

== Definition of measurement in the social sciences ==
The definition of measurement in the social sciences has a long history.  A currently widespread definition, proposed by [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] (1946), is that measurement is "the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to some rule."  This definition was introduced in the paper in which Stevens proposed four [[levels of measurement]].  Although widely adopted, this definition differs in important respects from the more classical definition of measurement adopted in the physical sciences, namely that scientific measurement entails "the estimation or discovery of the ratio of some magnitude of a quantitative attribute to a unit of the same attribute" (p.&amp;nbsp;358)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michell|first1=Joel|title=Quantitative science and the definition of measurement in psychology|journal=British Journal of Psychology|date=August 1997|volume=88|issue=3|pages=355–383|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1997.tb02641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Stevens's definition of measurement was put forward in response to the British Ferguson Committee, whose chair, A. Ferguson, was a physicist.  The committee was appointed in 1932 by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to investigate the possibility of quantitatively estimating sensory events.  Although its chair and other members were physicists, the committee also included several psychologists.  The committee's report highlighted the importance of the definition of measurement.  While Stevens's response was to propose a new definition, which has had considerable influence in the field, this was by no means the only response to the report.  Another, notably different, response was to accept the classical definition, as reflected in the following statement:

:Measurement in psychology and physics are in no sense different.  Physicists can measure when they can find the operations by which they may meet the necessary criteria; psychologists have but to do the same.  They need not worry about the mysterious differences between the meaning of measurement in the two sciences. (Reese, 1943, p. 49)

These divergent responses are reflected in alternative approaches to measurement.  For example, methods based on [[covariance matrix|covariance matrices]] are typically employed on the premise that numbers, such as raw scores derived from assessments, are measurements.  Such approaches implicitly entail Stevens's definition of measurement, which requires only that numbers are ''assigned'' according to some rule.  The main research task, then, is generally considered to be the discovery of associations between scores, and of factors posited to underlie such associations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

On the other hand, when measurement models such as the [[Rasch model]] are employed, numbers are not assigned based on a rule.  Instead, in keeping with Reese's statement above, specific criteria for measurement are stated, and the goal is to construct procedures or operations that provide data that meet the relevant criteria. Measurements are estimated based on the models, and tests are conducted to ascertain whether the relevant criteria have been met.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Instruments and procedures ==
The first{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}psychometric instruments were designed to measure the concept of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://examenpsicometrico.com/los-diferentes-tipos-de-tests-psicometricos/|title=Los diferentes tipos de tests psicometricos - examen psicometrico|website=examenpsicometrico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One historical approach involved the [[Stanford-Binet IQ test]], developed originally by the French psychologist [[Alfred Binet]].  Intelligence tests are useful tools for various purposes.  An alternative conception of intelligence is that cognitive capacities within individuals are a manifestation of a general component, or [[general intelligence factor]], as well as cognitive capacity specific to a given domain.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Psychometrics is applied widely{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} in educational assessment to measure abilities in domains such as [[literacy|reading, writing]], and [[mathematics]].  The main approaches in applying tests in these domains have been [[classical test theory]] and the more recent [[Item Response Theory]] and [[Rasch model|Rasch]] measurement models.  These latter approaches permit joint scaling of persons and assessment items, which provides a basis for mapping of developmental continua by allowing descriptions of the skills displayed at various points along a continuum.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Another major focus in psychometrics has been on [[personality test]]ing.  There have been a range of theoretical approaches to conceptualizing and measuring personality.  Some of the better known instruments include the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]], the [[Big five personality traits|Five-Factor Model]] (or "Big 5") and tools such as [[Personality and Preference Inventory]] and the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]].  Attitudes have also been studied extensively using psychometric approaches.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  A common method in the measurement of attitudes is the use of the [[Likert scale]].  An alternative method involves the application of unfolding measurement models, the most general being the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (Andrich &amp; Luo, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;Andrich, D. &amp; Luo, G. (1993). A hyperbolic cosine latent trait model for unfolding dichotomous single-stimulus responses. Applied Psychological Measurement, 17, 253-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches ==
Psychometricians have developed a number of different measurement theories.  These include [[classical test theory]] (CTT) and [[item response theory]] (IRT).&lt;ref&gt;Embretson, S.E., &amp; Reise, S.P. (2000). ''Item Response Theory for Psychologists''. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hambleton, R.K., &amp; Swaminathan, H. (1985). ''Item Response Theory: Principles and Applications.'' Boston: Kluwer-Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;  An approach which seems mathematically to be similar to IRT but also quite distinctive, in terms of its origins and features, is represented by the [[Rasch model]] for measurement.  The development of the Rasch model, and the broader class of models to which it belongs, was explicitly founded on requirements of measurement in the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Rasch, G. (1960/1980). ''Probabilistic models for some intelligence and attainment tests''. Copenhagen, Danish Institute for Educational Research, expanded edition (1980) with foreword and afterword by B.D. Wright. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychometricians have also developed methods for working with large matrices of correlations and covariances. Techniques in this general tradition include: [[factor analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, B.R. (2004). ''Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis: Understanding Concepts and Applications.'' American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; a method of determining the underlying dimensions of data; [[multidimensional scaling]],&lt;ref&gt;Davison, M.L. (1992). ''Multidimensional Scaling.'' Krieger.&lt;/ref&gt; a method for finding a simple representation for data with a large number of latent dimensions; and [[data clustering]], an approach to finding objects that are like each other. All these multivariate descriptive methods try to distill large amounts of data into simpler structures. More recently, [[structural equation modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, D. (2008). ''Structural Equation Modeling: Foundations and Extensions'', 2nd ed. Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]] represent more sophisticated approaches to working with large [[Covariance matrix|covariance matrices]]. These methods allow statistically sophisticated models to be fitted to data and tested to determine if they are adequate fits.

One of the main deficiencies in various factor analyses is a lack of consensus in cutting points for determining the number of latent factors. A usual procedure is to stop factoring when [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] drop below one because the original sphere shrinks. The lack of the cutting points concerns other multivariate methods, also.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Key concepts ===
Key concepts in classical test theory are [[Reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] and [[Test validity|validity]]. A reliable measure is one that measures a construct consistently across time, individuals, and situations. A valid measure is one that measures what it is intended to measure. Reliability is necessary, but not sufficient, for validity.

Both reliability and validity can be assessed statistically. Consistency over repeated measures of the same test can be assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient, and is often called ''test-retest reliability.''&lt;ref name="gifted.uconn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/Siegle/research/Instrument+Reliability+and+Validity/Reliability.htm|title=Home - Educational Research Basics by Del Siegle|website=www.gifted.uconn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly,  the equivalence of different versions of the same measure can be indexed by a [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation]], and is called ''equivalent forms reliability'' or a similar term.&lt;ref name="gifted.uconn" /&gt;

Internal consistency, which addresses the homogeneity of a single test form, may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test, which is termed ''split-half reliability''; the value of this [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] for two half-tests is adjusted with the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]] to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests.&lt;ref name="gifted.uconn" /&gt;  Perhaps the most commonly used index of reliability is [[Cronbach's α]], which is equivalent to the [[mean]] of all possible split-half coefficients.  Other approaches include the [[intra-class correlation]], which is the ratio of variance of measurements of a given target to the variance of all targets.

There are a number of different forms of validity. Criterion-related validity can be assessed by correlating a measure with a criterion measure theoretically expected to be related. When the criterion measure is collected at the same time as the measure being validated the goal is to establish ''[[concurrent validity]]''; when the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish ''[[predictive validity]]''. A measure has ''[[construct validity]]'' if it is related to measures of other constructs as required by theory. ''[[Content validity]]'' is a demonstration that the items of a test do an adequate job of covering the domain being measured. In a personnel selection example, test content is based on a defined statement or set of statements of knowledge, skill, ability, or other characteristics obtained from a ''[[job analysis]]''.

[[Item response theory]] models the relationship between [[latent trait]]s and responses to test items. Among other advantages, IRT provides a basis for obtaining an estimate of the location of a test-taker on a given latent trait as well as the standard error of measurement of that location. For example, a university student's knowledge of history can be deduced from his or her score on a university test and then be compared reliably with a high school student's knowledge deduced from a less difficult test. Scores derived by classical test theory do not have this characteristic, and assessment of actual ability (rather than ability relative to other test-takers) must be assessed by comparing scores to those of a "norm group" randomly selected from the population. In fact, all measures derived from classical test theory are dependent on the sample tested, while, in principle, those derived from item response theory are not.

Many psychometricians are also concerned with finding and eliminating test [[bias]] from their psychological tests. Test bias is a form of systematic (i.e., non-random) error which leads to examinees from one demographic group having an unwarranted advantage over examinees from another demographic group.&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Yoon|first2=Myeongsun|last3=Price|first3=Chris J.|title=Exploring the various interpretations of "test bias"|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=20|pages=570–582|doi=10.1037/a0036503|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/a0036503|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to leading experts, test bias may cause differences in average scores across demographic groups, but differences in group scores are not sufficient evidence that test bias is actually present because the test could be measuring real differences among groups.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, C. R. (2000). Why is psychometric research on bias in mental testing so often ignored? ''Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 6'', 144-150. doi:10.1037/1076-8971.6.1.144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"/&gt; Psychometricians use sophisticated scientific methods to search for test bias and eliminate it. Research shows that it is usually impossible for people reading a test item to accurately determine whether it is biased or not.&lt;ref&gt;Reschly, D. J. (1980) Psychological evidence in the ''Larry P.'' opinion: A case of right problem-wrong solution? ''School Psychology Review, 9'', 123-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standards of quality ==
The considerations of [[validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] typically are viewed as essential elements for determining the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of any test.  However, professional and practitioner associations frequently have placed these concerns within broader contexts when developing [[Standards organization|standards]] and making overall judgments about the quality of any test as a whole within a given context. A consideration of concern in many applied research settings is whether or not the metric of a given psychological inventory is meaningful or arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.tamu.edu/Faculty/blanton/bj.2006.arbitrary.pdf Blanton, H., &amp; Jaccard, J. (2006). Arbitrary metrics in psychology.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510182915/http://psychology.tamu.edu/Faculty/blanton/bj.2006.arbitrary.pdf |date=2006-05-10 }} ''American Psychologist, 61''(1), 27-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testing standards ===
In 2014, the American Educational Research Association (AERA), American Psychological Association (APA), and National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) published a revision of the ''[[Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/science/standards.html#overview|title=The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing|website=http://www.apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes standards for test development, evaluation, and use.  The ''Standards'' cover essential topics in testing including validity, reliability/errors of measurement, and fairness in testing.  The book also establishes standards related to testing operations including test design and development, scores, scales, norms, score linking, cut scores, test administration, scoring, reporting, score interpretation, test documentation, and rights and responsibilities of test takers and test users.  Finally, the ''Standards'' cover topics related to testing applications, including [[Psychological testing|psychological testing and assessment]], workplace testing and [[Professional certification|credentialing]], [[Test (student assessment)|educational testing and assessment]], and testing in [[program evaluation]] and public policy.

=== Evaluation standards ===
In the field of [[evaluation]], and in particular [[educational evaluation]], the [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/ Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044732/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/ |date=2009-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has published three sets of standards for evaluations. ''The Personnel Evaluation Standards''&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1988). ''[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PERSTNDS-SUM.htm The Personnel Evaluation Standards: How to Assess Systems for Evaluating Educators.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212001638/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PERSTNDS-SUM.htm |date=2005-12-12 }}'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1988, ''The Program Evaluation Standards'' (2nd edition)&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1994). ''[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PGMSTNDS-SUM.htm The Program Evaluation Standards, 2nd Edition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222025348/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PGMSTNDS-SUM.htm |date=2006-02-22 }}'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1994, and ''The Student Evaluation Standards''&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (2003).  ''[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/briefing/ses/ The Student Evaluation Standards: How to Improve Evaluations of Students.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524144621/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/briefing/ses/ |date=2006-05-24 }}'' Newbury Park, CA: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2003.

Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2395969/Author_guidelines_for_reporting_scale_development_and_validation_results_in_the_Journal_of_the_Society_for_Social_Work_and_Research |title=Author guidelines for reporting scale development and validation results in the Journal of the Society for Social Work and Research]|author=E. Cabrera-Nguyen|work=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate.  In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic.  For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance.

== Non-human: animals and machines ==

Psychometrics addresses ''human'' abilities, attitudes, traits and educational evolution. Notably, the study of behavior, mental processes and abilities of non-human ''animals'' is usually addressed by [[comparative psychology]], or with a continuum between non-human animals and the rest of animals by [[evolutionary psychology]]. Nonetheless there are some advocators for a more gradual transition between the approach taken for humans and the approach taken for (non-human) animals.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Humphreys, L.G.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evaluation of abilities, traits and learning evolution of ''machines'' has been mostly unrelated to the case of humans and non-human animals, with specific approaches in the area of [[artificial intelligence]]. A more integrated approach, under the name of universal psychometrics, has also been proposed.&lt;ref name="upsycho"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=J. Hernández-Orallo |author2=D.L. Dowe |author3=M.V.

'''Rio Blanco''' is [[stream]] that is tributary of the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]] in southern [[Colorado]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="gnis"&gt;{{gnis|184549|Rio Blanco}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stream originates in the [[San Juan Mountains]] and flows for {{convert|30|mi|km}} through the [[San Juan National Forest]] and private lands to its confluence with the San Juan River in [[Archuleta County, Colorado]]. Colorado classifies the Rio Blanco as an Aquatic Life Coldwater Class 1/Recreation Class 1 waterway supporting water supply and agricultural uses.&lt;ref name=epa&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado: Lower Rio Blanco Watershed|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/success319/co_rioblanco.cfm|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river also features native [[cutthroat trout]] and introduced [[rainbow trout]] fishing.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/24/sports/24trout.html?_r=0|title=The Man Who Brought Trout to a Valley of Gravel|last=Santella|first=Chris|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 Dec 2010|accessdate=15 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott Taylor|title=Fishing the Pagosa Springs Area (Pagosa Springs - Freshwater Fishing Report)|url=https://www.cyberangler.com/fishing-reports/colorado/pagosa-springs/fishing-pagosa-springs-area-18816.htm|publisher=Cyber Angler|date=30 Apr 2010|accessdate=15 Oct 2014|quote=Rio Blanco: This is probably the most under fished river in our area, this river is a true adventure every time.|location=Southwest Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration project==
[[San Juan-Chama Project|The San Juan-Chama Diversion Project]], which was started in 1971, eventually led to reduced water flow and a loss of [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic habitat]] in the Rio Blanco. In 1998, Colorado included a 12-mile reach of the lower Rio Blanco on its list of impaired waters for failure to support its aquatic life due to sediment. A project to restore the stream channel to match the [[Fluvial|altered flow regime]], resulted in the river's physical and biological function and water quality being improved. In 2008, Colorado removed the Rio Blanco, including the 12-miles of the lower reach, from the state’s list of impaired waters.&lt;ref name=epa/&gt;

==Fishing==
Parts of the river range from ten to twenty feet wide and you can fish on the side creeks and Rito Blanco. Most of the trout are in the 7-12" range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado Rivers Information (Blanco)|url=http://www.cmcflyfish.org/co_river_summaries_pg1.htm|publisher=Colorado Mountain Club}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three miles of the river that were transformed by [[Hydrology|hydrologist]] Dave Rosgen, from being wide and shallow to a deep flow that now supports a variety of trout. Rosgen's plan included placing boulders and old trees on the river banks to direct the waters toward a channel that would be more defined. He also constructed a tube to divert away the gravel and sand, which allows water to flow through, but the sediment is routed to a holding area which is regularly emptied and used elsewhere. Cost of the renovation was about $1 million. The three mile stretch may be fished by guests of El Rancho Pinoso, a privately owned ranch near the river.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fly Fishing|url=http://www.elranchopinoso.com/flyfishing.html|publisher=El Rancho Pinoso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rosette sampler''' is a device used for [[water]] [[Sample (material)|sampling]] in deep water (such as the [[Great Lakes]] or [[Ocean|oceans]]) in order to investigate about its [[water quality|quality]].

== Description ==
A rosette sampler is made of an assembly of 12 to 36 sampling bottles.&lt;ref name=whoi&gt;[https://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8415&amp;tid=7342&amp;cid=11375 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, "Rosette Sampler"]&lt;/ref&gt; Each bottle is a [[volume]] that range from a minimum value of 1.2 [[Litre|L]] to a maximum value of 30 L.&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; All of them constitutes the rosette sampler and are clustered around a cylinder situated in the center of the assembly,&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; where there is a sensing system called Sea-Bird or [[CTD (instrument)|CTD]], that stands for "Conductivity, Temperature and Depth", although other variables can be measured by modern CTDs (e.g. water [[turbidity]], dissolved [[oxygen]] [[concentration]], [[chlorophyll]] concentration and [[pH]]).&lt;ref name=cee&gt;[http://www.cee.mtu.edu/great_lakes/images2/spotlight_rosette_CDT.html Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering Department at Michigan Tech, "CTD and the Rosette samples on Lake Superior"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparatus is attached to a wire rope. A winch on board of the boat unroll the rope during descent and roll up it during the ascent (i.e. at the end of the samples collection). During operations in the ocean, a rosette sampler can approach the seabed at a distance from 1 to 5 m, depending on the particular sea conditions.&lt;ref name=jan/&gt;

The opening of each sampling bottle can be automatic (by reaching a certain depth) or manual (by operator, remotely).&lt;ref name=cee/&gt;

== Applications ==
Water sampling is used in general for [[chemical analysis]] and [[ecotoxicology|ecotoxicological]] assessment.&lt;ref name=jan&gt;[https://www.cefas.co.uk/premiam/publications/post-incident-monitoring-guidelines-subsea-oil-releases-and-dispersant-use/tg01-water-sampling/ Jan Brant, "Collection of water samples"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A rosette sampler is preferred to [[Winchester sampler]] for collection of water sampling at depths greater than 50 [[meter|m]].&lt;ref name=jan/&gt;

A '''scientific demonstration''' is a [[scientific experiment]] carried out for the purposes of demonstrating scientific principles, rather than for [[hypothesis testing]] or knowledge gathering (although they may originally have been carried out for these purposes).

Most scientific demonstrations are simple laboratory demonstrations intended to demonstrate physical principles, often in a surprising or entertaining way. They are carried out in schools and universities, and sometimes in public demonstrations in popular science lectures and TV programs aimed at the general public. Many scientific demonstrations are chosen for their combination of educational merit and entertainment value, which is often provided by dramatic phenomena such as explosions. 

Public scientific demonstrations were a common occurrence in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and have long  been a feature of the British [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], which date back to 1825. In the television era, scientific demonstrations have featured in science-related entertainment shows such as ''[[MythBusters]]'' and ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]''.

==Examples==
Some famous scientific demonstrations include:

* [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Biruni]]'s [[reaction time]]
* [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]'s [[camera obscura]], [[Oil lamp|lamp]] experiment and [[magnifying lens]]
* [[Al-Jazari]]'s [[crankshaft]], [[elephant clock]] and programmable [[robot]]s
* [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]]'s [[parasite]]s
* [[Detonation|Detonating]] a cloud of [[flour]]
* [[Foucault pendulum|Foucault's pendulum]]
* [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ball experiments, [[pendulum]] and [[telescope]]
* [[Heron's fountain]] and [[aeolipile]]
* [[Ibn al-Nafis]]' [[pulmonary circulation]] and [[coronary circulation]]
* [[Gyroscope|Gyroscopic]] [[bicycle wheel]]
* [[Nylon rope trick]] 
* [[Prince Rupert's Drop]]s
* Shooting a [[candle]] through a [[Plank (wood)|plank]]
* [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]'s [[alarm clock]], [[steam turbine]]
* Using a [[linear motor]] as a gun
* Using compressed air to drive a [[water rocket]]
* Using [[liquid nitrogen]] to shatter a rose
* [[William Harvey]]'s [[circulatory system]]

Note: many scientific demonstrations are potentially dangerous, and should not be attempted without considerable laboratory experience and appropriate safety precautions. Many older well-known scientific demonstrations, once mainstays of science education, are now effectively impossible to demonstrate to an audience without breaking health and safety laws. Some older demonstrations, such as allowing the audience to play with liquid mercury, are sufficiently dangerous that they should not be attempted by anyone under any circumstances.

==Technical Overview==
===Technical Concept===
Restore [[Nature]] in a Natural way is the technical concept of ''Simulate Loam Substrate'', and this technology is applied to form the ideal [[soil structure]], select suitable plant species to ensure the proportion of [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s in the later plant communities, &lt;ref name="National Intellectual Property Administration"&gt;[http://epub.sipo.gov.cn/tdcdesc.action?strWhere=CN107251729A 2017103443306 A Simulate Loam Substrate spray-casting construction method for slope].''[[National Intellectual Property Administration]]''.Retrieved 17 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;so as to restore [[Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lvyan.cn/about/?192.html Simulate Loam Substrate：Mine geological environment recovery technology].''lvyan.cn''.(in Chinese and English).Retrieved 12 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="China Land and Resources News"&gt;[http://zgdzzhyfz.paperopen.com/oa/darticle.aspx?type=view&amp;id=180123 类壤土基质技術及其在礦山環境恢復治理中的若干應用].''China Land and Resources News''.(in Chinese and English).Retrieved 25 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-ZGDH201801022.htm Simulate Loam Substrate类壤土基质及相關應用].''[[China National Knowledge Infrastructure]]''.Retrieved 22 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Technical principle===
As the ecological environment green governance technology, the core of ''Simulate Loam Substrate'' is to combine the engineering, botany, soil science and other disciplines to simulate the loam matrix structure suitable for plant growth through [[biomimetic technology]], which is beneficial to plant seeds, root development, microbial activity and nutrient transformation.&lt;ref name="National Intellectual Property Administration"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lib.cqu.edu.cn/asset/detail.aspx?id=203282775542 类壤土基质：一種新型生態環境綠色治理技術].''[[Chongqing University]]''.Retrieved 9 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southwest University of Political Science and Law''' ('''SWUPL''') is a national public university located in [[Chongqing]].

It was founded in 1953 with the original name '''Southwest College of Political Science and Law'''. It was one of the oldest Faculty of Political Science and Law after the People's Republic of China was established. Its law school ranks 3rd among all the law schools in China. Notable alumni include [[Liang Huixing]], [[Liang Zhiping]], [[He Weifang]], and [[Zhang Xinbao]].

Zhou Qiang, grade 1978 graduate from the Law Department of SWUPL, was elected president of the Supreme People's Court of China at the fifth plenary meeting of the first session of the 12th National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing on March 15, 2013.

==History==
As one of the oldest political science and law universities in China, Southwest University of Political Science and Law (SWUPL) developed from the Department of Political Science and Law at Southwest University of People’s Revolution which was founded in 1950, with Marshal Liu Bocheng as the university president.

In 1953, SWUPL was officially established through merging the Political Science and Law departments of Chongqing University and Sichuan University, the Law departments of Chongqing Finance and Economy College, and of Guizhou University and Yunnan University.

In 1978, the University was accredited as a key university by the State Council. In 2000, the administration of the University was transferred from the Ministry of Justice to the Chongqing municipality, thus creating a system of co-administration between the central and local government.

In 2003, it was approved as one of the first universities to grant doctoral degree of first-level legal discipline. In 2004, it established one post-doctorate mobile station of Law. In 2007, SWUPL was awarded as “excellent undergraduate education” by Ministry of Education.

In 2008, SWUPL became the key university co-administrated by Ministry of Education and Chongqing Municipality.

SWUPL became the first University in Chongqing co-administrated by the Ministry and Municipality. On October 24, 2012.

The University has three campuses, the main in Yubei, the other two in Shapingba and Baoshenghu, covering a total area of 3136.17 mu. There are 14 schools, including School of Civil and Commercial law, School of Economic Law, Law School, School of Administrative Law, School of International Law, School of Criminal investigation, School of Marxism, School of Juris Master, School of Management, School of Politics and Public Administration, School of Journalism and Communication, School of Foreign Languages, School of Applied Law, and School of Economics.

It offers 20 bachelor’s programs, 37 master’s programs of sub-disciplines, 4 professional master’s programs and 10 doctoral programs of sub-discipline, and 2 national key disciplines. The University has postdoctoral center for legal research and 6 provincial key bases for humanity and social science research. It has 1421 faculty and staff members, among which 1157 are full-time. It has 5159 postgraduates and 18591 undergraduates. The University’s library boasts a collection of more than 4,200,000 books.

SWUPL has international exchange programs with over 60 universities from U.S., United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Thailand, and South Korea. In 2014, SWUPL and Coventry University established China's only undergraduate Sino-UK English Law programme. SWUPL and University of Montana have also jointly established the first Confucius Institute in Northwest of U.S. In 2011, SWUPL and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) signed a cooperation agreement on the International Training Centre for local Authorities Project. The project, with a total of 100 million US dollars investment, will build training center in SWUPL and make full use of the training resources of the United Nations.

63 years since the foundation of the University, SWUPL has developed a multi-level and multi-type higher education for undergraduates, postgraduates, doctoral candidates, and international students, and has educated more than 200,000 high ranking specialized personnel. It is the university that provided the most law personnel for the country. A large number of alumni have become backbones and leading figures in law field and other professions.

If built, it would have a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometre.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skatelescope.org/about/facts-figures/ |title=Facts and figures |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1117/2.3201407.12| title = Philip Diamond plenary: The Square Kilometre Array: A Physics Machine for the 21st Century| journal = SPIE Newsroom| year = 2014| last1 = Spie}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would operate over a wide range of frequencies and its size would make it 50 times more sensitive than any other radio instrument. It would require very high performance central computing engines and long-haul links with a capacity greater than the global [[Internet traffic]] as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SKA-Brochure.pdf], ''The Square Kilometre Array'', p.19&lt;/ref&gt; It should be able to [[Astronomical survey|survey the sky]] more than ten thousand times faster than before.

With receiving stations extending out to a distance of at least 3,000&amp;nbsp;kilometres (1,900&amp;nbsp;mi) from a concentrated central core, it would exploit [[radio astronomy]]'s ability to provide the highest resolution [[image]]s in all [[astronomy]]. The SKA would be built in the [[southern hemisphere]], in sub-Saharan states with cores in South Africa and Australia, where the view of the [[Milky Way]] [[Galaxy]] is the best and [[radio interference]] at its least.&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt;

The SKA is projected to cost €1.8 billion, including €650 million for Phase 1. The funding will come from many international funding agencies. The SKA and the [[European Extremely Large Telescope]] (E-ELT) are two flagship facilities for ground-based astronomy in the future.

Construction of the SKA is scheduled to begin in 2019 for initial observations by 2022, but the construction budget is not secured at this stage{{when|date=October 2018}}. The SKA would be built in two phases, with Phase 1 representing about 10% of the capability of the whole telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skatelescope.org/about/project/ |title=The project timeline |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=28 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ajn9v23t?url=http://www.skatelescope.org/about/project/ |archivedate=17 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ska.ac.za/about/bid.php |title=SKA site bid outcome |publisher=SKA Africa |accessdate=28 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626022118/http://ska.ac.za/about/bid.php |archivedate=26 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 1 of the SKA was cost-capped at 650 million euros in 2013, while Phase 2's cost has not yet been established.&lt;ref name="SKA Project"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.skatelescope.org/project/ |title=SKA Project |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the project are located at the [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]], in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.skatelescope.org/ska-organisation/ |title=The SKA Organisation |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32523768 UK to be giant telescope's HQ].

==Description==
[[File:SKA participants map.svg|thumb|320px|Countries that participated in the preparatory phase of SKA&lt;ref name=SKAorghist&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.skatelescope.org/the-organisation/history-of-the-organisation/participating-countries/ |title=Participating countries |publisher=SKA Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The SKA will combine the signals received from thousands of small [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] spread over a distance of several thousand kilometres to simulate a single giant radio telescope capable of extremely high sensitivity and angular resolution, using a technique called [[aperture synthesis]].&lt;ref name=skalayout&gt;{{cite web|title=The SKA Layout|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/layout/|website=SKA Telescope|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the sub-arrays of the SKA will also have a very large field-of-view (FOV), making it possible to survey very large areas of sky at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World’s Largest Radio Telescope Takes A Major Step Towards Construction|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/news/worlds-largest-radio-telescope-near-construction/|website=SKA Science|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One innovative development is the use of [[Focal-plane array (radio astronomy)|focal-plane arrays]] using [[phased-array]] technology to provide multiple [[FOV]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SKA Aperture Arrays|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/aperture-arrays/|website=SKA Telescope|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will greatly increase the survey speed of the SKA and enable several users to observe different pieces of the sky simultaneously, which is useful for (e.g.) monitoring multiple pulsars. The combination of a very large FOV with high sensitivity means that the SKA will be able to compile extremely large surveys of the sky considerably faster than any other telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How will SKA1 be better than today's best radio telescopes?

The SKA will provide continuous frequency coverage from 50&amp;nbsp;MHz to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz in the first two phases of its construction. A third phase will then extend the frequency range up to 30&amp;nbsp;GHz.
* Phase 1: Providing ~10% of the total collecting area at low and mid frequencies by 2023 (SKA1).&lt;ref name=ska1&gt;{{cite web|title=SKA1|url=http://astronomers.skatelescope.org/ska1/|website=SKA Science|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 2: Completion of the full array (SKA2) at low and mid frequencies by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SKA2|url=http://astronomers.skatelescope.org/ska2/|website=SKA Science|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency range from 50&amp;nbsp;MHz to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz, spanning more than two [[Decade (log scale)|decades]], cannot be realised using one design of antenna and so the SKA will comprise separate sub-arrays of different types of antenna elements that will make up the SKA-low, SKA-mid and survey arrays:

[[File:SKA sparse array big.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a Low-Band SKA Sparse Aperture Array Station]]
[[File:SKA dense array big.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a SKA Dense Aperture Array Station]]

# SKA-low array – a phased array of simple [[dipole antenna]]s to cover the frequency range from 50 to 350&amp;nbsp;MHz. These will be grouped in 100&amp;nbsp;m diameter stations each containing about 90 elements.
# SKA-mid array – an array of several thousand [[Parabolic antenna|dish antennas]] (around 200 to be built in Phase 1) to cover the frequency range 350&amp;nbsp;MHz to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz. It is expected that the antenna design will follow that of the [[Allen Telescope Array]] using an offset Gregorian design having a height of 15 metres and a width of 12 metres.&lt;ref name=ska1 /&gt;
# SKA-survey array – a compact array of parabolic dishes of 12–15 meters diameter each for the medium-frequency range, each equipped with a multi-beam, phased array feed with a large field of view and several receiving systems covering about 350&amp;nbsp;MHz – 4&amp;nbsp;GHz. The survey sub-array was removed from the SKA1 specification following a "rebaselining" exercise in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McPherson|first1=A.|title=REPORT AND OPTIONS FOR RE-BASELINING OF SKA-1|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SKA-TEL-SKO-0000229_Report-and-Options-for-Re-Baselining-of-SKA-1-Word_Amm-signed.pdf|website=SKA Telescope|publisher=SKAO|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area covered by the SKA – extending out to ~3000&amp;nbsp;km – will comprise three regions:&lt;ref name=skalayout /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewdney|first1=P. E.|title=SKA Baseline Design|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/SKA-TEL-SKO-DD-001-1_BaselineDesign1.pdf|website=SKA Telescope|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A central region containing about 5&amp;nbsp;km diameter cores of SKA-mid antennas (South Africa) and SKA-low dipoles (Western Australia). These central regions will contain approximately half of the total collecting area of the SKA arrays.
# A mid region extending out to 180&amp;nbsp;km. This will contain dishes and pairs of SKA-mid and SKA-low stations. In each case they will be randomly placed within the area with the density of dishes and stations falling off towards the outer part of the region.
# An outer region from 180&amp;nbsp;km to 3000&amp;nbsp;km. This will comprise five spiral arms, along which dishes of SKA-mid, grouped into stations of 20 dishes, will be located. The separation of the stations increases towards the outer ends of the spiral arms.

The capabilities of the SKA will be designed to address a wide range of questions in [[astrophysics]], [[physics#Fundamental physics|fundamental physics]], [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[particle astrophysics]] as well as extending the range of the [[observable universe]]. A number of key science projects that have been selected for implementation via the SKA are listed below.

===Extreme tests of general relativity===
{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}
For almost one hundred years, [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]] has precisely predicted the outcome of every experiment made to test it. Most of these tests, including the most stringent ones, have been carried out using radio astronomical measurements. By using [[pulsars]] as cosmic [[gravitational wave]] detectors, or timing pulsars found orbiting [[black holes]], astronomers will be able to examine the limits of general relativity such as the behaviour of [[spacetime]] in regions of extremely curved space. The goal is to reveal whether Einstein was correct in his description of space, time and gravity, or whether [[alternatives to general relativity]] are needed to account for these phenomena.

===Galaxies, cosmology, dark matter and dark energy===
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution|Dark matter}}
The sensitivity of the SKA in the [[hydrogen line|21 cm hydrogen line]] will map a billion galaxies out to the edge of the observable Universe. The [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]] revealed will give constraints to determine the processes resulting in [[galaxy formation and evolution]]. Imaging [[hydrogen]] through the Universe will provide a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] picture of the first ripples of structure that formed individual galaxies and clusters. This may also allow the measurement of effects [[hypothesis|hypothetically]] caused by [[dark energy]] and causing the increasing [[Hubble's law|rate of expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Evolution, Cosmology And Dark Energy – Further Information|url=http://www.skatelescope.org/the-science/ska-key-science-projects/ska-key-science-projects/galaxy-evolution/  |publisher=Skatelescope.org |date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epoch of re-ionization===
The SKA is intended to provide observational data from the so-called [[timeline of the Big Bang#Dark Ages|Dark Ages]] (between 300,000 years after the [[Big Bang]] when the universe became cool enough for hydrogen to become neutral and decouple from radiation) and the time of [[First light (astronomy)|First Light]] (a billion years later when young galaxies are seen to form for the first time and hydrogen becomes again ionized). By observing the primordial distribution of gas, the SKA should be able to see how the Universe gradually lit up as its stars and galaxies formed and then evolved. This period between the Dark Ages and First Light is considered the first chapter in the cosmic story of creation and the distance to see this event is the reason for the Square Kilometre Array's design. To see back to First Light requires a telescope 100 times more powerful than the biggest radio telescopes currently in the world, taking up 1 million square metres of collecting area, or one square kilometre.&lt;ref&gt;RiAus 2011, ''Radio Astronomy: Something Kinda Awesome, (SKA), viewed 1st October 2014'', http://vimeo.com/23460933/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmic magnetism===
It is still not possible to answer basic questions about the origin and evolution of [[magnetism|cosmic magnetic fields]], but it is clear that they are an important component of interstellar and intergalactic space. By mapping the effects of magnetism on the radiation from very distant galaxies, the SKA will investigate the form of cosmic magnetism and the role it has played in the evolving Universe.

===Search for extraterrestrial life===
This key science program, called "Cradle of Life", will focus on three  objectives: [[protoplanetary disc]]s in [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zones]], search for prebiotic chemistry, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ([[SETI]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nrao.edu/science/Decadal%20Survey/rfi/SKA.pdf The  Square Kilometre Array Project Description for Astro 2010] -Response to Program Prioritization Panels. James Cordes. 1 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The SKA will be able to probe the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]] of Sun-like [[protostar]]s, where [[Earth analog|Earth-like planets]] or moons are most likely to have environments favourable for the [[abiogenesis|development of life]].&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;[https://www.skatelescope.org/cradle-life/ SKA - Cradle Of Life].

Wilner. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The signatures of forming Earth-like planets imprinted on circumstellar dust may be the most conspicuous evidence of their presence and evolution,&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt; and may even detect [[planetary habitability|planets capable of supporting life]].&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://astronomy.curtin.edu.au/research/ska.cfm Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy] - Cradle of Life. April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Astrobiology|Astrobiologists]] will also use the SKA to search for complex [[organic compound]]s (carbon-containing chemicals) in outer space, including [[amino acid]]s, by identifying spectral lines at specific frequencies.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;
*The SKA will be capable of detecting extremely weak radio emissions "leakage" from nearby [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] civilizations, if they exist.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;

==Locations==
The headquarters of the SKA will be located at [[Manchester]]'s [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]], [[Cheshire]], England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skatelescope.org/news/construction-starts-ska-organisation-headquarters/ |title=Construction starts on SKA Organisation headquarters |date=18 April 2012 |publisher=SKA Organisation |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the telescopes will be installed in Australia and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ska.gov.au/About/Pages/CohostingTheSKA.aspx Co-hosting the SKA]. SKA&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:SKA-scanner.jpg|thumb|An automatic wideband radio scanner system was used to survey the radio frequency noise levels at the various candidate sites in South Africa.]]
Suitable sites for the SKA telescope must be in unpopulated areas with guaranteed very low levels of man-made radio interference. Four sites were initially proposed in South Africa, Australia, Argentina and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koenig|first=Robert|date=18 August 2006|title=RADIO ASTRONOMY: Candidate Sites for World's Largest Telescope Face First Big Hurdle|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]]|volume=313|issue=5789|pages=910–912|doi=10.1126/science.313.5789.910|pmid=16917038}}&lt;/ref&gt; After considerable site evaluation surveys, Argentina and China were dropped and the other two sites were shortlisted (with New Zealand joining the Australian bid, and 8 other African countries joining the South African bid):

'''Australia:''' The core site is located at the [[Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory]] (MRO) at [[Mileura Station]] near [[Boolardy]] in [[Western Australia]] 315&amp;nbsp;km north-east of [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]]&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;Amos, J.

'''South Africa:''' The core site is located at {{Coord|30|43|16.068|S|21|24|40.06|E|display=inline}} at an elevation of about 1000 metres in the [[Karoo]] area of the arid [[Northern Cape]] Province, about 75&amp;nbsp;km north-west of [[Carnarvon, South Africa|Carnarvon]], with distant stations in [[Botswana]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zambia]].

On 10 March 2012 it was reported that the SKA Site Advisory Committee had made a confidential report in February that the South African bid was stronger.&lt;ref name="age 20120309"&gt;{{cite news|last=Flitton|first=Daniel|title=Australia on the outer for largest space telescope|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/australia-on-the-outer-for-largest-space-telescope-20120309-1upwr.html|accessdate=9 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final decision on the site by the project's board of directors was expected on 4 April 2012.&lt;ref name="age 20120309"/&gt; However a scientific working group was set up to explore possible implementation options of the two candidate host regions, and its report was expected in mid May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Further delays signalled in super-telescope plan |agency=AFP |work=[[The Australian]]| date =5 April 2012 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/further-delays-signalled-in-super-telescope-plan/story-e6frgakx-1226319328674| accessdate =10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 2012 it was announced that the SKA will be split over the South African and African sites and the Australia and New Zealand sites.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18194984|title=Africa and Australasia to share Square Kilometre Array|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=25 May 2012|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; While New Zealand remains a member of the SKA Organisation, {{as of|2014|lc=y}} it appears that no SKA infrastructure is likely to be in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Australia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skatelescope.org/location/australia/|title=Australia - SKA Telescope|date=2014|publisher=SKA|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors, pathfinders and design studies==
Many groups are working globally to develop the technology and techniques required for the SKA. Their contributions to the international SKA project are classified as either: Precursors, Pathfinders or Design Studies.
* Precursor facility: A telescope on one of the two SKA candidate sites, carrying out SKA-related activity.
* Pathfinder: A telescope or programme carrying out SKA-related technology, science and operations activity.

====Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP)====
{{Main|Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder}}
The Australian SKA Pathfinder, or ASKAP, is an A$100 million project to build a telescope array of thirty-six twelve-metre dishes. It will employ advanced, innovative technologies such as [[Focal-plane array (radio astronomy)|phased array feeds]] to give a wide field of view (30 square degrees).

ASKAP is being built by [[CSIRO]] at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory site, located near [[Boolardy]] in the mid-west region of Western Australia. All 36 antennas and their technical systems were officially opened in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Osborne |first=Darren |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-05/outback-observatory-open-for-business/4298094 |title=Outback observatory open for business - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====MeerKAT====
{{Main|MeerKAT}}
MeerKAT is a South African project consisting of an array of sixty-four 13.5-metre diameter dishes as a world class science instrument, and also to help develop technology for the SKA. [[KAT-7]], a seven-dish engineering and science testbed instrument for MeerKAT, near Carnarvon in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa was commissioned in 2012 and is up and running. As of May 2018, all sixty-four 13.5-metre diameter (44.3 feet) dish antennae have been completed with verification tests underway to ensure the instruments are functioning correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tshangela|first1=Lebo|title=MeerKAT telescope is complete|url=http://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/meerkat-telescope-is-complete/|accessdate=25 May 2018|work=SABC News|date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dishes will be equipped with a number of high performance single pixel feeds to cover frequencies from 580&amp;nbsp;MHz up to 14&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ska.ac.za|title=SKA SA – Square Kilometre Array radio telescope (SKA) South Africa|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data challenges====
The amount of sensory information collected pose a huge storage problem and require real-time [[signal processing]] to reduce the information to relevant data. In mid 2011 it was estimated the array could generate an [[exabyte]] a day of raw data, which could be compressed to around 10 [[petabyte]]s.&lt;ref name="ttgmd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/392735/ska_telescope_generate_more_data_than_entire_internet_2020/ |title=SKA telescope to generate more data than entire Internet in 2020 |date=7 July 2011 |work=Computerworld |publisher=IDG Communications |accessdate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technology Development Project (TDP)====
The Technology Development Project, or TDP, is a US$12 million project to specifically develop dish and feed technology for the SKA. It is operated by a consortium of universities led by [[Cornell University]] and was completed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skatdp.astro.cornell.edu/|title=Welcome to the SKA TDP Website|first=Shami|last=Chatterjee|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline and funding==
The SKA was originally conceived in 1991 with an international working group set up in 1993. This led to the signing of the first Memorandum of Agreement in 2000. Considerable early development work then followed. This culminated in the commencement of PrepSKA in 2008 leading to a full SKA design in 2012. Construction of Phase 1 will take place from 2018 to 2020 providing an operational array capable of carrying out the first science. Phase 2 will then follow for completion in 2025 providing full sensitivity for frequencies up to at least 14&amp;nbsp;GHz.

==Project risks==
Potential risks for priority astronomical sites in South Africa are protected by the [[Astronomy Geographic Advantage Act]] of 2007. Put in place to specifically support the South African SKA bid, it outlaws all activities that could endanger scientific operation of core astronomical instruments. In 2010, concerns were raised over the will to enforce this law when [[Royal Dutch Shell]] applied to explore the [[Karoo]] for [[shale gas]] using [[hydraulic fracturing]], an activity that would have the potential to increase [[radio interference]] at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nordling|first=Linda|title=Mining plans pose threat to South African astronomy site|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110322/full/news.2011.174.html?s=news_rss|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An identified remote station location for the southern African array in [[Mozambique]] was subject to flooding and excluded from the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201206270018.html
|title=Mozambique: Exact Location of SKA Telescope Sought
|date=26 June 2012
|newspaper=[[AllAfrica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
despite the SKA Site Selection Committee technical analysis reporting that all African remote stations could implement flood mitigation solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skatelescope.org/uploaded/34228_120216_SSAC.Report_web.pdf|title=Report and Recommendation of the SKA Site Advisory Committee (SSAC)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's first [[radio quiet zone]] was established by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) on 11 April 2005 specifically to protect and maintain the current "radio-quietness" of the main Australian SKA site at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planning for the radio astronomy service |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100628 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909092701/http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD//pc=PC_100628 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 September 2007 |accessdate=3 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, a former Australian SKA Committee chairman raised concerns with South African media about risks at the Australian candidate site, particularly in terms of cost, mining interference and land agreements. SKA Australia stated that all points had been addressed in the site bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=22 February 2012
|newspaper=[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2014, South Africa experienced a month-long strike action by the [[National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa|National Union of Metalworkers]] (NUMSA), which added to the delays of the installation of dishes. The plan was to have six dishes operational by November, but only one [[MeerKAT]] dish stands on the [[Karoo]] site in the Northern Cape.&lt;ref name="Strike action"&gt;{{cite news

|newspaper=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest risk to the overall project is probably its budget, which up until now has not been committed.&lt;ref name="SKA Project"/&gt;

==Opposition to the SKA project==
There has been opposition to the project from farmers and businesses, as well as individuals, since the project's inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronomers and sheep farmers butt heads over the Square Kilometer Array|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21713855-radio-telescope-project-encounters-nimbyism-remote-part-south|website=www.economist.com|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocacy group called Save the Karoo has stated that the radio quiet zone will create further unemployment in the region where unemployment is already above 32%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save the Karoo|url=http://savethekaroo.com/|website=savethekaroo.com/|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers had stated that the agriculture-based economy in the Karoo would collapse if they were forced to sell their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sarah|first1=Wild|title=In South Africa, Opposition Flares against Giant SKA Radio Telescope|date=22 June 2016|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/in-south-africa-opposition-flares-against-giant-ska-radio-telescope/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wild|first1=Sarah|title=Giant SKA telescope rattles South African community|url=http://www.nature.com/news/giant-ska-telescope-rattles-south-african-community-1.20129|website=Nature|accessdate=30 March 2017|pages=444–446|language=en|doi=10.1038/534444a|date=23 June 2016|bibcode = 2016Natur.534..444W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Taking the piss''''' is a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] term meaning to take liberties at the expense of others, or to be joking, or to be unreasonable. It is a shortening of the idiom '''taking the piss out of,''' which is an [[idiom|expression]] meaning to [[Parody|mock]], tease, joke, ridicule, or scoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Chris Roberts (author)|first=Chris |last=Roberts|title=Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme|publisher=Thorndike Press|year=2006|isbn=0-7862-8517-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not to be confused with "taking a piss", which refers to the act of urinating. '''Taking the Mickey''' (Mickey Bliss, [[Cockney]] [[rhyming slang]]), '''taking the Mick''' or '''taking the Michael''' is another term for making fun of someone. These terms are most widely used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]].

==Usage==
The term sometimes refers to a form of mockery in which the mocker exaggerates the other person's characteristics; pretending to take on his or her attitudes, etc., for the purpose of comedic effect at the expense of another.  This would be described as "taking the piss" out of that person, or "a piss-take". It may be also be used to refer to a ruse whereby a person is led to believe a plainly unbelievable fact for the purpose of ridicule of the subject, e.g. "Are you being serious?" "No, I'm just taking the piss."

The phrase is in common usage throughout British society, employed by headline writers in broadsheet gazettes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2212788,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Taking the Mickey out of Saatchi | first=Vanessa | last=Thorpe | date=18 November 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tabloids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=380769&amp;in_page_id=1773 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Are Jordan and Peter taking the Mickey? | date=23 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as colloquially. It is also used in English speaking countries such as Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/20/1050777165949.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Taking the Mickey | date=21 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/to-mitigate-gibbs-outburst-is-simply-taking-the-mickey/2007/01/16/1168709752692.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=To mitigate Gibbs outburst is simply taking the Mickey | date=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In colloquial usage, "taking the piss" is also used to refer to someone or something that makes a claim which is not in line with a recognised agreement e.g. an invoice that is double the quoted price with no explanation for the added charge could be said to "take the piss", or likewise if something consistently misses a deadline.

The term can also mean to take unfair advantage.  For example, if someone has a food [[buffet]] and one guest clearly takes more than their expected share.  It can also relate to an abuse of trust, such as "''You can use my 'phone, but don't take the piss!''", i.e. do not abuse my offer of assistance by making lengthy calls that will cost me a lot of money.  Equally, a wilfully unproductive employee could be described as "taking the piss" for accepting a wage while knowingly failing to deliver on their obligation, or an employer could be accused of "taking the piss" for making unreasonable requests of their employees, e.g. expecting them to do unpaid overtime.

==Origin==
"Take the piss" may be a reference to a related (and dated) idiomatic expression, ''piss-proud'', which is a vulgar pun referring to the [[Nocturnal penile tumescence|morning erections]] which happen when a man awakens at the end of a dream cycle (each about 90 minutes in length throughout the night) or may be caused by a full bladder pressing upon nerves that help affect erection.  This could be considered a 'false' erection, as its origin is physiological not sexual, so in a metaphoric sense, then, someone who is "piss-proud" would suffer from false pride, and ''taking the piss out of them'' refers to deflating this false pride, through disparagement or mockery.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A753527 |title=The Origins and Common Usage of British Swear Words |publisher=BBC |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-tak2.htm |title=Take the piss |accessdate=7 January 2011 |last=Quinion |first=Michael |work=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt; As knowledge of the expression's metaphoric origin became lost on users, "taking the piss out of" came to be synonymous with disparagement or mockery itself, with less regard to the pride of the subject.

"Take the mickey" may be an abbreviated form of the [[Cockney rhyming slang]] "take the Mickey Bliss",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/344000.html |title=Take the Mickey |accessdate=30 January 2008 |last=Martin |first=Gary |work=The Phrase Finder }}&lt;/ref&gt; a euphemism for "take the piss." It has also been suggested that "mickey" is a contraction of "[[urination|micturition]],"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; in which case "take the micturition" would be a synonymous euphemism for "take the piss." The phrase has been noted since the 1930s.

===Alternative theory of origin===
One theory is that during the [[History of the British canal system|age of the canals]] in Britain, urine would be brought up the canals to the wool mills in Northern England (particularly to Yorkshire), as urine was used in the process of fixing dye to wool. This was particularly the case when dyeing items blue with [[Indigo dye|indigo]] or more traditionally with [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]], before [[synthetic dyes]] were invented or made commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.dgwbirch.com/?p=3 |title=Taking the piss |publisher=Blog.dgwbirch.com |date=19 December 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425130027/http://blog.dgwbirch.com/?p=3 |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being in the business of transporting urine was much less lucrative than transporting wine, so when the boatmen were questioned what they were carrying they would lie and say "I'm taking wine" and the response would be "No, you're taking the piss" to express disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.uk.com/history/a-dyeing-art-jess-dyde/ |title=Dying Art |publisher=History.uk.com |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=16 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415051715/http://www.history.uk.com/history/a-dyeing-art-jess-dyde/ |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In soil science, a '''transiogram''' is the accompanying spatial [[correlation]] measure of simplified [[Markov chain random field]] (MCRF) models based on the conditional independence assumption, and an important part of [[Markov chain geostatistics]]. It is defined as a [[transition probability]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] over the distance lag. 

Simply, a transiogram refers to a [[transition probability]]-lag diagram. Transiograms include auto-transiograms and cross-transiograms. The former represent the spatial auto-correlation of a single category, and the latter represent the spatial [[interclass relationships]] among different categories. 

Experimental transiograms can be directly estimated from sparse sample data. Transiogram models, which provide [[transition probabilities]] at any lags for [[Markov chain]] [[mathematical model|modeling]], can be further acquired through model fitting of experimental transiograms. In general, the transiogram is a spatial correlation measure following the style of a variogram, and includes a set of concepts and a set of methods for obtaining transition probability values from sample data and providing transition probabilities values for simplified MCRF models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1617">In [[telecommunication]], a '''transmission level point''' ('''TLP''') is a physical test point in an [[electronic circuit]], typically a transmission channel, where a test [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] may be inserted or measured.&lt;ref name=reeve&gt;Whitham R. Reeve (1992) ''Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook—Analog'',  IEEE Press, p.229&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, various parameters, such as the [[power (physics)|power]] of the signal, noise, or test tones inserted are specified or measured at the TLP.

The nominal transmission level at a TLP is a function of system design and is an expression of the design [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] or [[attenuation]] (loss).

[[Voice channel|Voice-channel]] transmission levels at test points are measured in [[dBm|decibel-milliwatts]] (dBm) at a [[frequency]] of ca. 1000 [[hertz]]. The dBm is an absolute level with respect to 1 mW. The TLP is thus characterized by the relation:&lt;ref name=reeve /&gt;

:TLP = dBm — dBm0

When the nominal signal power is 0 [[dBm]] at the TLP,  the test point is called a ''zero transmission level point'', or ''zero-dBm TLP''. In general, the term ''TLP'' is commonly used as if it were a unit, preceded by the nominal level for the test point. For example, the expression ''0 TLP'' refers to a ''0 dBm TLP''.  At a −16 TLP, the measured level of 0 dBm is +16 dBm0.

The level at a TLP where an [[end instrument]], such as a [[telephone]] set, is connected is usually specified as 0 dBm.

'''Wayfinding''' encompasses all of the ways in which people (and animals) [[Orientation (mental)|orient]] themselves in physical space and [[navigate]] from place to place.

==Basic process==
The basic process of wayfinding involves four stages:

# ''Orientation'' is the attempt to determine one's location, in relation to objects that may be nearby and the desired destination. 
# ''Route decision'' is the selection of a course of direction to the destination. 
# ''Route monitoring'' is checking to make sure that the selected route is heading towards the destination.
# ''Destination recognition'' is when the destination is recognized.&lt;ref&gt;Lidwell, William, Kritina Holden and Jill Butler. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=l0QPECGQySYC&amp;pg=PA260 Universal Principles of Design]''. (Rockport Publishers, Beverly, MA, 2010) p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==
Historically, wayfinding refers to the techniques used by travelers over land and sea to find relatively unmarked and often mislabeled routes. These include but are not limited to [[dead reckoning]], [[map]] and [[compass]], [[astronomical]] positioning and, more recently, [[global positioning]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Wayfinding can also refer to the traditional [[Polynesian navigation|navigation method used by indigenous peoples of Polynesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/ Polynesian Voyaging Society (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Polynesians and Pacific Islanders mastered the way of wayfinding to explore and settle on the islands of the Pacific, many using devices such as the [[Marshall Islands stick chart]].  With these skills, some of them were even able to navigate the ocean as well as they could navigate their own land.  Despite the dangers of being out at sea for a long time, wayfinding was a way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Lin, [http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/03/03/hokulea-the-art-of-wayfinding-interview-with-a-master-navigator/ "Hokule{{okina}}a: The Art of Wayfinding (Interview with a Master Navigator),"] ''National Geographic'' website, 3 March 2014, retrieved on 29 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, The Polynesian Voyaging Society tries-out
the traditional Polynesian ways of navigation. In October 2014, the crew of the
Hokuleʻa arrived on another island in [[Tonga]].

==Modern usage of the term==

Recently, wayfinding has been used in the context of [[architecture]] to refer to the user experience of orientation and choosing a path within the [[built environment]]. [[Kevin A. Lynch]] used the term for his 1960 book ''The Image of the City'', where he defined wayfinding as "a consistent use and organization of definite sensory cues from the external environment."

In 1984 environmental psychologist Romedi Passini published the full-length "Wayfinding in Architecture" and expanded the concept to include the use of signage and other [[graphic communication]], visual clues in the built environment, audible communication, tactile elements, including provisions for special-needs users.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The wayfinding concept was further expanded in a further book by renowned Canadian graphic designer Paul Arthur, and Romedi Passini, published in 1992, "Wayfinding:  People, Signs and Architecture." The book serves as a veritable wayfinding bible of descriptions, illustrations, and lists, all set into a practical context of how people use both signs and other wayfinding cues to find their way in complex environments. There is an extensive bibliography, including information on exiting information and how effective it has been during emergencies such as fires in public places.&lt;ref&gt;Originally published 1992, McGraw Hill, reissued in a limited commemorative edition in 2002 by SEGD. {{ISBN|978-0075510161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wayfinding also refers to the set of architectural or design elements that aid orientation. Today, the term '''wayshowing,''' coined by [[Per Mollerup]],&lt;ref&gt;Per Mollerup, Wayshowing, A Guide to Environmental Signage (Lars Muller Publisher)&lt;/ref&gt; is used to cover the act of assisting way finding.&lt;ref&gt;Per Mollerup, Wayshowing&gt;Wayfinding: Basic &amp; Interactive (BIS Publishers)&lt;/ref&gt; describes the difference between wayshowing and way finding, and codifies the nine wayfinding strategies we all use when navigating in unknown territories. However, there is some debate over the importance of using the term wayshowing, some argue that it merely adds confusion to a discipline that is already highly misunderstood.

In 2010 AHA Press Published "WAYFINDING FOR HEALTHCARE Best Practices for Today's Facilities", written by Randy R. Cooper. The book takes a comprehensive view of Wayfinding specifically for those in search of medical care.&lt;ref&gt;AHA Press, Health Forum Inc.,  An American Hospital Association Company – Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst wayfinding applies to cross disciplinary practices including architecture, art and design, signage design, psychology, environmental studies, one of the most recent definitions by Paul Symonds et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Symonds |first2=David H. K. |last2=Brown |first3=Valeria |last3=Lo Iacono |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.5153/sro.4185 |title=Wayfinding as an Embodied Sociocultural Experience |journal=Sociological Research Online |volume=22 |issue=1 |page=5 |doi=10.5153/sro.4185 |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines wayfinding as "The cognitive, social and corporeal process and experience of locating, following or discovering a route through and to a given space". Wayfinding is an embodied and sociocultural activity in addition to being a cognitive process in that wayfinding takes places almost exclusively in social environments with, around and past other peoples and influenced by stakeholders who manage and control the routes through which we try to find our way. The route is often one we might take for pleasure, such as to see a scenic highway, or one we take as a physical challenge such as trying to find the way through a set of underground caves. Wayfinding is a complex practice that very often involves techniques such as people-asking (asking people for directions) and crowd following and is thus a practice that combines psychological and sociocultural processes.

In addition to the built environment, the concept of wayfinding has also recently been applied to the concept of career development and an individuals attempt to create meaning within context of career identity. This was addressed in late August in the NPR podcast You 2.0: How Silicon Valley Can Help You Get Unstuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/08/28/546716951/you-2-0-how-silicon-valley-can-help-you-get-unstuck |title=How Silicon Valley Can Help You Get Unstuck |date=August 28, 2017 |work=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wayfinding in architecture, signage and urban planning==

Modern wayfinding has begun to incorporate research on why people get lost, how they react to signage and how these systems can be improved.

===Urban planning===

An example of an urban wayfinding scheme is the [[Legible London]] Wayfinding system.

Nashville, Tennessee has introduced a live music wayfinding plan. Posted outside each live music venue is a guitar pick reading Live Music Venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitmusiccity.com/Visitors |title=Visitors |website=Nashville Music City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor wayfinding===

Indoor wayfinding in public buildings such as hospitals is commonly aided by kiosks,&lt;ref&gt;
Raven, A., Laberge, J., Ganton, J. &amp; Johnson, M., [http://uxpamagazine.org/wayfinding-in-a-hospital/ Wayfinding in a Hospital: Electronic Kiosks Point the Way], [http://uxpamagazine.org/issue/14-3/ UX Magazine 14.3], September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; indoor maps, and building directories. Such spaces that involve areas outside the normal vocabulary of visitors show the need for a common set of language-independent symbols.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
Offering indoor maps for handheld mobile devices is becoming common, as are digital information [[Interactive kiosk#Building directory and wayfinding kiosk|kiosk systems]].  Other frequent wayfinding aids are the use of color coding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelwayfinding.com/colours/ |title=Using Colours in Wayfinding and Navigation |first=Paul |last=Symonds |website=travelwayfinding.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signage clustering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelwayfinding.com/clustering-and-signage/ |title=Clustering and Signage in Wayfinding |website=travelwayfinding.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) represented a milestone in helping to make spaces universally accessible and improving wayfinding for users.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
