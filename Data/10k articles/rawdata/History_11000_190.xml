      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3331">'''Abram Borisovich Ranovich ''' (real surname '''Rabinovich''', {{lang-ru|Абрам Борисович Ранович}}, {{OldStyleDate|15 December|1885|3 December}} – 29 May 1948) was a [[Soviet]] scholar of [[classical antiquity]] and religion. Ranovich authored several publications on the history of [[Judaism]] and [[early Christianity]].&lt;ref name="gse"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/126213/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87 |title=Ранович Абрам Борисович|work=[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Советская энциклопедия| language=Russian|accessdate =12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Order of the Badge of Honour]].&lt;ref name="gse"/&gt;

Born in [[Zhytomyr]], Ranovich received his doctoral degree in 1937.&lt;ref name="gse"/&gt; In 1937–41, he was the Professor of the [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref name="gse"/&gt; Ranovich's works ''Sources for the Study of the Social Roots of Christianity'' and ''Primary Sources for the History of Early Christianity'', both published in 1933, as well as ''The Ancient Criticism of Christianity: Fragments from Lucian, Celsus, Porphiry and Others'' (1935) provided Soviet historians of Christianity with the materials to go further. Ranovich also translated [[Frontinus]]' ''[[Stratagems (Frontinus)|Stratagems]]'' into Russian. His final work, ''On Early Christianity'' (published posthumously in 1959) was a major Soviet study of this topic. According to Ranovich, three factors contributed to the success of Christianity: the teaching about the incarnation of the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]] in man, the social richness of [[Christian eschatology]] and the international nature of its preaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=James Thrower| title =Marxist-Leninist 'Scientific Atheism' and the Study of Religion and Atheism in the USSR| publisher =Walter de Gruyter| year =1983| page =427| isbn =3110838583}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time Ranovich supported the [[Christ myth theory]] compatible with [[materialistic]] [[Marxist–Leninist]] approach of his times; in particular, he wrote: "It can be considered scientifically well established that Jesus Christ is a mythical creature. He was not the founder of the religion whose ignorant and gullible followers elevated him to the rank of God and endowed him with superhuman traits, as liberal theologians want to portray. On the contrary, Jesus is a deity, who was later endowed with human traits, with earthly 'biography'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://pstgu.ru/download/1430825026.5_andreev_73-88.pdf |title=Дискуссия об историчности Иисуса Христа в советском религиоведении|author=А. В. Андреев|work=Вестник ПСТГУ|language=Russian| date=2015| accessdate =12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranovich died in [[Moscow]] at the age of 62.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1607">'''Antisthenes of [[Rhodes]]''' ({{lang-el|Ἀντισθένης ὁ Ῥόδιος}}) was a Greek historian who lived c. 200 BCE. He took an active part in the political affairs of his country, and wrote a history of his own time, which, notwithstanding his bias towards his native island, is spoken of in terms of high praise by [[Polybius]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, xvi. 14, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote an account of the [[Battle of Lade (201 BC)]] and was, according to Polybius, a contemporary with the events he described.

It is likely that this Antisthenes is the historian who wrote a ''[[Successions of Philosophers|Successions]]'' of the Greek philosophers which is often referred to by [[Diogenes Laërtius]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, i. 40, ii. 39, 98, vi. 77, 87, vii. 168, ix. 6, 27, 35, 38, 39, 57; cf. vi. 19&lt;/ref&gt; He might also be the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosopher cited by [[Phlegon of Tralles]].&lt;ref&gt;Phlegon, ''de Mirabil.'' 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]] mentions an Antisthenes who wrote a work called ''Meleagris'', of which the third book is quoted;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''de Flav.'' 22&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] speaks of an Antisthenes who wrote on the pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Hist. Nat.'' xxxvi. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aron of Kangeq''' (born in [[Kangeq]] on April 9, 1822; died March 12, 1869) was a [[Greenland]] [[Inuit]] hunter, painter, and [[Oral history|oral historian]]. His woodcuts and watercolors are noted for their depiction of Inuit culture and history, and the often violent encounters between Inuit and Danish colonizers. His storytelling is known to children's literature in Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3UHTsUmt1PEC&amp;pg=PA32 Historical dictionary of the Inuit By Pamela R.

'''''Banausos''''' ([[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|βάναυσος}}, plural {{lang|grc|βάναυσοι}}, ''banausoi'') is a [[pejorative]] applied to the [[Social class|class]] of [[manual labour|manual labor]]ers or [[artisan]]s in [[Ancient Greece]]. The related [[abstract noun]] {{lang|grc|βαναυσία}} &amp;ndash; ''banausia'' is defined by [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] as "every craft ({{lang|grc|τέχνη}}) [conducted] by means of fire", reflecting the [[folk etymology]] of the word as coming from {{lang|grc|βαῦνος}} (''baunos'') "furnace" and {{lang|grc|αὔω}} (''auō'') "to dry".&lt;ref name="Pierre"&gt;''Banausie''. In: Heinrich August Pierer, Julius Löbe (in German): ''Universal-Lexikon der Gegenwart und Vergangenheit.'' Fourth ed., vol. 2; Altenburg 1857, page 264 (Online bei zeno.org)&lt;/ref&gt; The actual etymology of the words is unknown; they are not attested outside [[Attic dialect|Attic]]-[[Ionic dialect|Ionic]] or before the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name="Pierre"/&gt;  The [[Epic poetry|epic]] [[hero]]es call their smiths {{lang|grc|δημιουργοί}} &amp;ndash; ''[[Demiourgoi|dēmiourgoi]]''.

==Athenian usage==
The use of ''banausos'' follows an economic transition in Greece: the use of [[Currency|coinage]], the invention of the [[trireme]] and of [[hoplite]] armor, the prevalence of chattel [[slavery]] permitted the rise of a new hoplite class, who used the term to distance themselves from the artisans.

''Banausos'' was used as a term of invective, meaning "cramped in body" ([[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]] 1341 a 7) and "vulgar in taste" (1337 b 7),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=[[Aristotle]] |title=Aristotle in 23 Volumes |volume=21 |translator=H. Rackham |location=Cambridge, MA; London |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]; William Heinemann Ltd. |year=1944 |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0086,035:1:1258b}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the extreme [[oligarchy|oligarch]]s in Athens in the 5th century BC, who were led by [[Critias]]. These were the [[Laconophile]]s who yearned for the good old times when there was none of this "equality" nonsense, and you could beat your neighbor's slave in the street (see [[Old Oligarch|Ps.-Xenophon]]: Constitution of Athens). In this usage, it refers to the [[working class|laboring class]] as a whole; i.e. the artisans, such as potters, stonemasons, carpenters, professional singers, artists, musicians, and all persons engaged in trade or retail.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} It makes no distinction between slave or free.
  
These extreme oligarchs were opposed both to the moderate oligarchs, such as [[Theramenes]], and to the [[democracy|democrat]]s, such as [[Pericles]], [[Cleon]], and [[Thrasybulus]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}  They held power at Athens for less than a year, with the assistance of a Spartan army; because of their use of exile, purges, midnight arrests, and judicial murder, are remembered as the [[Thirty Tyrants]]. But while they vanished from the political scene, the word remained.

==Philosophers==
[[Plato]], the [[philosopher]], was Critias's nephew, and used ''banausos'' in much the same sense, although in the [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]] he preferred the installation of philosophers, such as himself, above the hoplites, who were in turn above the artisan. It was also current among  the first generation of his pupils, such as [[Aristotle]], who writes, "Those who provide necessaries for an individual are slaves, and those who provide them for society are handicraftsmen and day-laborers."{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Plato further held that commerce had a corrupting influence in communities and acquisition of wealth destroyed their {{lang|grc|ὁμόνοια}} &amp;ndash; ''[[homonoia (concord)|homonoia]]'' (like-mindedness) and was the principal cause of {{lang|grc|στάσις}} &amp;ndash; ''stasis'' (faction). He also held that "merchants and craftsmen would be less willing to defend the civic territory than farmers would" and commerce and mercantilism had a morally corrupting influence.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Plato was concerned with the "best" state, which requires citizens who are the best and because they possess [[Arete (excellence)|''arete'']]. This is in contrast to the attitude, cited by [[Heraclitus]]: "We will have none best among us; if any among us would be the best, let him be so elsewhere and among others."

Plato argued, and Aristotle follows him in this, although not in other things, that the pursuit of arete required leisure. Technical education was necessary but did not make good citizens.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}   Leisure was a necessity of good citizenship – something the ''banausoi'' do not have.  ''Banausia'' deforms the body, rendering it useless for military and political duties.  Those occupations tire out the body and therefore the mind preventing self-education by reading and conversing with others. "It accustoms a man's mind to low ideas, and absorbs him in the pursuit of the mere means of life."

Plato and Aristotle teach that the highest thing in man is reason and therefore, the purpose of human perfection lies with the activity of reason; i.e. the 'theoretic' or contemplative life. Trade, industry and mechanical labour prevent this idea.  These activities are necessary for a good human condition of life but when these activities are merely regarded as means to making money and not as acts of service to truth, service to others and arete, then these, occupations become base.

After the time of [[Alexander the Great]], however, philosophers largely avoided practical politics. Thereafter ''banausos'' mostly appears in glossaries to Plato and Aristotle.

Later philosophic schools had different politics. For example, [[Cassius Dio]] defined democracy (dēmokrateía) thus: "when every man gets the honor that is his due."

==Revivals==
It has been conjectured that the  [[Elizabethan]] use of  "mechanical" (as in e.g. [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'') is a translation of ''banausos''. This is certainly possible &amp;mdash; the earliest recorded use of "mechanical" (OED ''s.v.'') is from [[John Lyly]], who used a linguistic style with many influences from Greek.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

''Banausos'' (or rather {{lang|grc|βαναυσικός}} &amp;ndash; ''banausikos'') has also been adapted into English, as the rare word '''banausic''', both as a term of abuse, and to represent Greek usage. According to [[Dagobert D. Runes]]' ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', it means "vulgar and illiberal", particularly when referring to arts or occupations that "deform the body or the mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ditext.com/runes/b.html| work=Dictionary of Philosophy| title= (Words beginning with) B | year=1942 | author= [[Dagobert D. Runes]] (ed.) | accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its use in English is not found before 1845,{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}  with the Victorian revival of classical learning.

One of the contributions of classical [[philology]] to the [[Kultur]]-movement in [[Wilhelmine]] and post-Wilhelmine [[Germany]] was the use of ''banausisch'' as an insult &amp;mdash; along with the [[mythology|myth]]s that the German Soul is essentially Greek, that the ancient Greeks were blond, and that the modern Greeks are not descended from them. Today in German ''Banause'' is used to mean an uncouth person indifferent to high culture, like English [[philistinism|philistine]].

These ideas have become less accepted since World War II, but they were occasionally reflected in the English-speaking world. For example, [[Edith Hamilton]] accepted them as the best scholarship of her school days. Again, a junior colleague of Sir [[Gilbert Murray]] permitted himself (in 1935) the following, which goes well beyond Greek usage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Livingstone|first=Sir Richard Winn|title=Greek Ideals and Modern Life|year=1935|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWNXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22The%20aim%20of%20a%20journalist%20may%20either%20be%20to%20enlarge%20the%20circulation%20of%20a%20paper%20or%20to%20give%20his%20readers%20a%20true%20and%20intelligent%20picture%20of%20the%20world%22&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''The aim of a journalist may either be to enlarge the circulation of a paper or to give his readers a true and intelligent picture of the world; of a lawyer either to extend his practice or to help justice be done; of a business man either to grow rich or to play his part as a 'nurse' of the community.  These alternatives are not exclusive.  But where the former predominates, the amount of [[arete (excellence)|arete]] generated will be small, and journalists, lawyers and industrialists will be banausoi rather than men.''

The '''[[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] War''' (1824), was a war between the [[Wiradjuri]] nation and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Following the successful [[Gregory Blaxland|Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|Lawson]], and [[William Wentworth|Wentworth]] expedition to find a route through the "impenetrable" [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] in 1813, this allowed the colony to expand onto the vast fertile plains of the west.
Settlement of the new land was initially slow, but following a change of government, Governor [[Thomas Brisbane]] came to power allowing a flood of land grants to the west of the Blue Mountains. The enormous influx of British colonists put massive strain on the traditional food sources{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} and sacred landmarks of the Wiradjuri.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

By early 1824, war had broken out in which the Wiradjuri adopted a guerrilla-style approach, after Governor Thomas Brisbane declared martial law the resistance soon collapsed in late 1824.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/resources/pdfs/127.pdf |title=Forgotten Rebels: Black Australians Who Fought Back |publisher=ICS and Associates |author=Lowe, David |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson===
Attempts to cross the Blue Mountains had been made from 1790 onwards with convicts seeking a way to escape and adventurers eager to explore the region. However, all of these attempts failed and it was to be over 20 years before a way across was found. In May 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Charles Wentworth set out with a plan to find a [[1813 crossing of the Blue Mountains|passage through the impenetrable Blue Mountains]]. After 21 days of traveling through {{convert|50|mi|km}} of rugged terrain, the party reached [[Mount Blaxland, New South Wales|Mount Blaxland]]. From here they saw a vast expanse of forest and grass in which Blaxland wrote was rich enough "to support the stock of the colony for the next thirty years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/exploration/blue_mountains/ |title=Crossing the Blue Mountains |publisher=State Library of New South Wales |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was in fact the land of the Wiradjuri people, one of the largest language groups in Australia. The Wiradjuri inhabited an area bounded by the Blue Mountains in the east, the western slopes in the south, and the change of open forest to grassy plains in the north and west. The tribes led by Windradyne lived in the eastern parts of this territory, connected to the other groups by a common language as well as cultural and trade links.&lt;ref&gt;P. Read, ''A Hundred Years War'', Canberra: ANU, 1988, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor Lachlan Macquarie===
[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Governor Lachlan Macquarie]]

After passage through the Blue Mountains had been secured, assistant surveyor [[George Evans (explorer)|George Evans]] and his party had been instructed to further explore the country. Evans' reports confirmed of excellent pastures beyond the mountains to which Governor Macquarie ordered a road be built from the [[Nepean River]]. In less than six months the {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} road had been completed. Soon after Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] and a large accompanying party set out to view the country. The journey took nine days by coach from [[Parramatta]] and on arrival Macquarie's welcoming ceremony was observed by seven Wiradjuri.&lt;ref&gt;Assistant Surveyor George Evans, Journal, 21/12/1813&lt;/ref&gt;

Macquarie wrote:
{{quote|
"We found here also three male natives and four boys of this newly discovered tract of country, who showed great surprise, mixed with no small degree of fear, at seeing so many strangers, horses and carriages but to whom they soon appeared to be reconciled on being kindly spoken to. They were all clothed with Mantles made of the skins of o'possums which were neatly sewn together and the outside of the skins were carved in a remarkably neat manner. They appear to be very inoffensive and cleanly in their persons."&lt;ref&gt;Governor Lachlan Macquarie, ''Journal of Tours in NSW and Van Diemen's Land, 1810–''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Three days later Macquarie inaugurated the town of Bathurst, then continued to tour the surrounding country. In his journal, Macquarie writes of being visited by three male natives and that "to the best looking and stoutest of them I gave a piece of yellow cloth in exchange for his mantle, which he presented me with".&lt;ref&gt;Macquarie, ''Journal of Tours in NSW and Van Diemen's Land, 1810–'', entry of 10/5/1815&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorised that this unknown Wiradjuri man may have been Windradyne, but this cannot be proven. Nevertheless, it would be another eight years before he would become famous to the colony. In 1820, the population of Bathurst was only 114 due to Macquarie's slow and cautious approach to new settlement. His experience of the [[Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars]] of 1795–1816 may also have made him hesitant to start a new conflict. It seems that the Wiradjuri were willing to tolerate this slow level of growth and peaceful relations were maintained during this period.

===Governor Thomas Brisbane===
[[File:Thomasbrisbane.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Governor Thomas Brisbane]]

In December 1821, Macquarie resigned partly due to undermining forces within his own government. His replacement was Governor Thomas Brisbane who had different views through which he began asserting his authority. Under Brisbane's hand settlement laws were changed leading to a flood of land grants across the Blue Mountains. An enormous influx of the British onto the Wiradjuri lands put great strain on traditional food sources, and destroyed some of the Wiradjuri social and sacred sites. In response, the Wiradjuri resistance was born, well aware that they had no chance against guns, they adopted a guerrilla-warfare approach in which attacks were made against outlying and undefended stations.

===Pre-war violence===
Following Governor Brisbane's decision to open the flood gates to the west of the Blue Mountains, various attacks were soon made against the growing settlement. In 1822, Wiradjuri warriors attacked a station on the [[Cudgegong River]] in which they drove away the stockman, let the cattle out of the yard and killed several of the sheep.&lt;ref&gt;J.P.M. Long, ''Bathurst, 1813–40'' quoted in Salisbury and Gresser, op cit, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; More attacks followed with the murder of convict hut-keepers, scattered herds and speared cattle. Stockmen were intimidated and would not leave their huts to round up the cattle and bring them in without protection. The government centre at Swallow Creek was soon abandoned in fear of attack. In late 1823, Windradyne (known as Saturday by the British) was captured for the first time.

The ''Sydney Gazette'' described the situation in the following:
{{quote|Advices from Bathurst say that the natives have been very troublesome in that country. Numbers of cattle have been killed. In justification of their conduct, the natives urge that the white men have driven away all the kangaroos and opossums, and the black men must now have beef!... The strength of these men is amazing. One of the chiefs (named Saturday) of a desperate tribe, took six men to secure him and they had actually to break a musket over his body before he yielded, which he did at length with broken ribs... Saturday for his exploits was sentenced to a month's imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 8/1/1824&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Course of the war==
===Potato Field Incident===
In early 1824, on the river flats opposite of the town of Bathurst, a farmer in a friendly gesture offered a group of passing natives some potatoes. The next day the families returned to the field, however, with no concept of private ownership of food supplies they began helping themselves. The farmer then fired upon the group and in the mayhem several natives were killed and some wounded. One of the survivors of this misunderstanding was Windradyne, enraged at the attack he and his warriors immediately began a series of violent attacks against nearby stations.&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury and Gresser, op cit, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

One settler account describes an encounter that took place soon after the Potato Field Incident:
{{quote|Our hut was one day surrounded by a large party of blacks, fully equipped for war, under the leadership of their great fierce chief and warrior, named by the whites ‘Saturday’. There was no means of resistance so my father, then a lad of eighteen years, met them fearlessly at the door. He spoke to them in their own language in such a manner as not to let them suppose he anticipated any evil from them. They stood there, sullen, silent, motionless. My father's cheerful courage and friendly tone disarmed animosity. They consulted in an undertone, and departed as sullenly and noiselessly as they came. The next thing known of them is that they killed... all the men at a settler's place some miles distant, the very place where it was rumoured, the poisoned bread had been laid for them.&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Suttor, quoted in Salisbury and Gresser, op cit, p.22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Revenge attacks===
Similar attacks occurred nearby, at "The Mill" and "Warren Gunyah". These attacks included men being speared, weapons stolen, buildings burned and stock killed. While Windradyne and his warriors engaged the area north-east of Bathurst, to the south relative tribes also attacked, terrorising settlers and driving off cattle. Revenge parties were formed in which a group of armed servants attacked and killed three Wiradjuri women. For several months the attacks by the Wiradjuri continued, they struck at unexpected locations then retreated back to the bush. By August 1824, the ''Sydney Gazette'' described it as "to have exposed the strength and wealth of the Colony... to destruction".&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Gazette'', 5/8/1824&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proclamation of martial law===
[[File:Windradyne, Aust. Aboriginal warrior from the Wiradjuri.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Windradyne]]
On 14 August Governor Brisbane issued a proclamation of [[martial law]]. Governor Brisbane's declaration read:

{{quote|WHEREAS THE ABORIGINAL NATIVES of the Districts near Bathurst have for many Weeks past carried on a Series of indiscriminate Attacks on the Stock Station there, putting some of the Keepers to cruel Deaths, wounding others, and dispersing and plundering the Flocks and Herds; themselves not escaping sanguinary Retaliations. AND WHEREAS the ordinary Powers of the CIVIL MAGISTRATES (although most anxiously exerted) have failed to protect the Lives of HIS MAJESTY'S Subjects; and every conciliatory Measure has been pursued in vain; and the Slaughter of Black Women and Children and Unoffending White Men, as well as of the lawless Objects of Terror, continue to threaten the before mentioned Districts; AND WHEREAS by Experience, it hath been found that mutual Bloodshed may be stopped by the Use of Arms against the Natives beyond the ordinary Rule of Law in Time of Peace, and for this End Resort to summary Justice has become necessary: NOW THEREFORE, by Virtue of the Authority in me vested by His Majesty's Royal Commission, I do declare, in Order to restore Tranquillity, MARTIAL LAW TO BE IN ALL THE COUNTRY WESTWARD OF MOUNT YORK; And all Soldiers are hereby ordered to assist and obey their lawful Superiors in suppressing the Violences aforesaid; and all His Majesty's Subjects are also called upon to assist the MAGISTRATES in executing such Measures, as any one or more of the said Magistrates shall direct to be taken for the same purpose, by such Ways and Means as are expedient, so long as Martial Law shall last; being always mindful that the Shedding of Blood is only just, where all other Means of Defence or of Peace are exhausted; that Cruelty is never Lawful; and that, when personal Attacks become necessary, the helpless Women and Children are to be spared."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/education-kids/classroom_learning/multimedia/interactives/bells_falls_gorge_html/cabinet_items/transcript_declaration_of_martial_law |title=Transcript: Declaration of Martial Law |work= Bells Falls Gorge: An Interactive Investigation |publisher=National Museum of Australia |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A detachment of the [[40th Regiment of Foot|40th Regiment]] was rushed to Bathurst, bringing the total number of soldiers to 75. Together with an armed militia of settlers they began murdering the native population. Despite martial law being declared it seemed to have had little impact on the activities of the Wiradjuri. According to W.H. Suttor, "The proclamation of martial law was as undecipherable to the natives as an Egyptian hieroglyph".&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Suttor, ''Australian Stories Retold and Sketches of Country Life, Bathurst''&lt;/ref&gt;

The natives continued with their attacks against the British, and skirmishes followed by massacres of warriors attempting to bury their dead. However, the majority of victims were native women and children gunned down from horseback, poisoned or driven into gorges. In October, the ''Sydney Gazette'' summed up the situation stating that "Bathurst and its surrounding vicinity is engaged in an exterminating war".&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Gazette'' 11/8/1824&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Bathurst===
The Battle of Bathurst began on 10 September when a Wiradjuri war party attacked a station on the Cudgegong River, they drove off the cattle before being pursued by the station hands.&lt;ref&gt;''Six Australian Battlefields'', by Al Grassby and Marji Hill&lt;/ref&gt; In an ambush, the stationhands were chased back and in the retreat three Wiradjuri warriors were shot. The following day the station hands returned to find the war parties' camp deserted as they were burying their dead, however most of the weapons were left in the camp and were subsequently destroyed. As the Wiradjuri returned to the war camp, the station hands fired on them killing at least sixteen and wounding many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treatyrepublic.net/content/bathurst-massacres |title=The Bathurst Massacres |publisher=Treaty Republic |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace===
At the outset of martial law, Windradyne's people had been informed that military operations against them would continue until their leaders were given up.  Windradyne himself had a reward of 500 acres of land upon his head. By late 1824, large numbers of Wiradjuri were surrendering themselves to the government however, Windradyne continued to elude the soldiers and as such martial law remained in place for a further seven weeks. On 11 December 1824, martial law was finally repealed, and on 28 December Windradyne appeared at the head of his people in Parramatta to attend the Governor's annual feast. He wore the word "peace" on his hat and knew the soldiers could not arrest him because of the possibility of a riot with so many Aborigines there.

The ''Sydney Gazette'' described Windradyne as:
{{quote|...one of the finest looking natives we have seen in this part of the country. He is not particularly tall but much stouter and more proportionable limbed than the majority of his countrymen; which combined with a noble looking countenance and piercing eye, are calculated to impress the beholder with other than disagreeable feelings towards a character who has been so much dreaded by the Bathurst settler. Saturday is, without doubt, the most manly native we have ever beheld.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Gazette, 30/12/1824&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Aftermath==

On 13 December 1824 Governor Brisbane wrote a letter to Major J.T.Morisset, Commandant at Bathurst, thanking him for effecting 'the purpose of the proclamation...by the judicious measures taken by you and the other magistrates at Bathurst, the aboriginal natives have learned to respect our power.'  He goes on to say that 'it is impossible perhaps at all times to prevent the infliction of injury upon them by individuals and...if justice cannot always be done, it deserves consideration upon such occasion whether the wrong may not be repaired by compensation.  For this service and for rewards to the natives who assisted in the police, I have directed ₤50 subject to detailed accounts of its expenditure to be at your disposal.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Papers relating to Colonel and Mrs Emily Morisset, 1822-1838|journal=NSW State Library|volume=Am34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This letter implies tacit acknowledgement that the punishment of the local Wiradjuri was excessive and unlawful.  It also indicates that there was use of aboriginal police aides in the tracking of the Wiradjuri people.

Colonel William Stewart, appointed Head of NSW Police and Lt Governor of the Colony helped oversee some of the government response to the Bathurst Uprising. His reward was to stand on a high point (Mount Pleasant) at the edge of Bathurst township and declare his right to all the land he could see. Governor Darling formalised the grant of 3200 acres in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Stewart, William (1769–1854)'|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/stewart-william-2700/text3787|access-date=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included unlimited and unrestricted water rights to the Macquarie River. The historical records, original deeds and agreements are held by the family at "Strath" Bathurst. Today the great wealth that came to Stewart and his descendants continues to be seen in the form of [[Abercrombie House]] that was later built on the land grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abercrombie House Bathurst|url=http://www.abercrombiehouse.com.au|website=Abercrombie House Bathurst|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of the war, the NSW colonial government also recognised the need to have a mounted infantry to effectively place the frontier under British control. Foot soldiers were proven to be an inadequate force on the wide plains of the interior. As a result, in 1825, Colonel Stewart formed the NSW Mounted Police.  This force, which was manned with soldiers not civilians, initially consisted of two detachments, one stationed in Bathurst and the other at Maitland.  The NSW Mounted Police became the principal instrument of enforcement of colonial rule on the frontier for the next 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connor|first1=John|title=The Australian Frontier Wars|date=2002|publisher=UNSW Press|location=Sydney|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16651">The '''Black Women Oral History Project''' consists of interviews with 72 African American women from 1976 to 1981, conducted under the auspices of the [[Schlesinger Library]] of [[Radcliffe College]], now [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]].&lt;ref name="Lomotey2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chamara J.

== Project background ==
Beginning in 1977, [[Ruth Edmonds Hill]] coordinated and devoted herself to the completion of the project and to creating awareness of the rich information contained in the transcripts. The project began with the goal of capturing the lives and stories of women of African descent, many already in their 70s, 80s and 90s.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Ruth Edmonds and Patricia Miller King, eds. (1989) ''The Black Women Oral History Project: A Guide to the Transcripts'', p. iii.&lt;/ref&gt; On the recommendation of Dr. [[Letitia Woods Brown]], professor of history at [[George Washington University]], and with funding secured from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the project began to address what Dr. Brown noted as inadequate documentation of the stories of African-American women in the Schlesinger Library and at other centers for research.&lt;ref name="nrs.harvard.edu"&gt;Black Women Oral History Project Interviews; Finding Aid. OH-31, T-32/finding aid Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:RAD.SCHL:sch01406 Retrieved 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The project sought a cross section of women who had made significant contributions to American society in the first half of the twentieth century.  Many interviewees had professional careers in such fields as education, government, the arts, business, medicine, law and social work.  Others combined care for their families with volunteer work at the local, regional, or national level. Most of the interviews explored topics such as family background, education and training, employment, voluntary activities, and family and personal life. The intention was to give the interviewee the opportunity to explore and reflect on the influences and events that shaped her life.

== Participants ==
Among the participants were [[Melnea Cass]], [[Zelma George]], [[Dorothy Height]], [[Queen Mother Moore]], [[Rosa Parks]], [[Esther Mae Scott]], [[Muriel S. Snowden]], and [[Dorothy West]].

Volume 2 of the published work features conversations with [[Sadie Alexander]], Elizabeth Barker, and [[Etta Moten Barnett]].&lt;ref name="HillAmerica1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ruth Edmonds Hill|author2=Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America|title=The Black women oral history project: from the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe College|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OB2AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=1 May 1991|publisher=Meckler|isbn=978-0-88736-607-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 3 includes interviews with [[Juanita Craft]], [[Alice Dunnigan]], and [[Eva B. Dykes]], while Volume 10 features [[Charleszetta Waddles]], Dorothy West, and Addie Williams.&lt;ref name="HillAmerica1991"/&gt;

All of the interviews are open for research with digitized materials, with the exception of the following: Merze Tate whose interview is not yet complete and five interviews that remain closed until 2027: Kathleen Adams, [[Margaret Walker Alexander]], [[Lucy Miller Mitchell]], [[Ruth Janetta Temple]], and [[Era Bell Thompson]].&lt;ref name="nrs.harvard.edu"/&gt;

    historical interest.

== Methodology ==
The interviews were recorded on audiotape and transcribed and each interviewee was given an opportunity to edit and correct the transcript prior to the final printing.  Both the transcripts and audiotapes have been archived and preserved at the Schlesinger Library.
Copies of these materials are also held in the [[Sophia Smith Collection]] at [[Smith College]] and include the published guide to the transcripts; also the summary of each woman's life and highlights of topics from their interviews, as well as an index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Smith College |title=Sophia Smith Collection, Collection number MS 414 |url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss346_main.html |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, the interviews and transcripts have been digitized and are available from the Schlesinger Library collection [http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:RAD.SCHL:sch01406 Black Women Oral History Project finding aid].

In 1981, Judith Sedwick offered to create portraits of a few of the interviewees, and later, with additional grant funding, photographed many more.  The result is a collection of stunning photographs, which became a traveling exhibition, first shown in 1984 at the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Sedwick, Judith.

In modern [[clothing]] and [[fashion design]], a '''button''' is a small [[fastener]], now most commonly made of [[plastic]], but also frequently made of metal, wood or [[seashell]], which secures two pieces of [[fabric]] together. In [[archaeology]], a button can be a significant [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]. In the [[applied art]]s and in [[crafts|craft]], a button can be an example of [[folk art]], [[studio craft]], or even a miniature [[art object|work of art]].

Buttons are most often attached to articles of [[clothing]] but can also be used on containers such as [[wallets]] and bags. However, buttons may be sewn onto garments and similar items exclusively for purposes of [[fashion|ornamentation]]. Buttons serving as [[fasteners]] work by slipping through a fabric or thread loop, or by sliding through a [[buttonhole]]. Other types of fastenings include [[zipper]]s, [[Hook and loop fastener|Velcro]] and [[magnet]]s.

==History==
Buttons and button-like objects used as ornaments or [[Seal (device)|seals]] rather than fasteners have been discovered in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] during its [[Kot Diji]] phase (c. 2800–2600 BC)&lt;ref name="Kot Diji Button seal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harappa.com/indus2/128.html|title=Fired steatite button|last=Khan|first=Omar|year=1999|work=The Indus Civilization|publisher=harrapa.com|accessdate=11 March 2010|location=San Francisco, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Bronze Age]] sites in [[History of China|China]] (c. 2000–1500 BC), and [[Ancient Rome]].

Buttons made from [[seashell]] were used in the Indus Valley Civilization for ornamental purposes by 2000 BC.&lt;ref name=Hesse&amp;Hesse&gt;Hesse, Rayner W. &amp; Hesse (Jr.), Rayner W. (2007). ''Jewelrymaking Through History: An Encyclopedia''. Greenwood Publishing Group. 35. {{ISBN|0-313-33507-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some buttons were carved into [[geometric shape]]s and had holes pierced into them so that they could be attached to clothing with thread.&lt;ref name=Hesse&amp;Hesse/&gt; Ian McNeil (1990) holds that: "The button, in fact, was originally used more as an ornament than as a fastening, the earliest known being found at [[Mohenjo-daro]] in the [[Indus Valley]]. It is made of a curved shell and about 5000 years old."&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, Ian  (1990). ''An encyclopaedia of the history of technology''. Taylor &amp; Francis. 852. {{ISBN|0-415-01306-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional buttons with buttonholes for fastening or closing clothes appeared first in [[Germany]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White: "The Act of Invention: Causes, Contexts, Continuities and Consequences", ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (Autumn, 1962), pp. 486–500 (497f. &amp; 500)&lt;/ref&gt; They soon became widespread with the rise of snug-fitting garments in 13th- and 14th-century [[Europe]].

===Buttons as containers===
Since at least the seventeenth century, when box-like metal buttons were constructed especially for the purpose,&lt;ref name="17th smuggler button"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/hg/index.ssf/2008/06/marv_bondarowicz_the_oregonian_3.html|title=For a collector hooked on history, every button tells a story|last=Dahl|first=Liz|date=June 5, 2008|work=The Oregonian: Homes &amp; Gardens|publisher=Oregon Live LLC|accessdate=11 March 2010|location=Oregon, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; buttons have been one of the items in which [[drug]] [[smugglers]] have attempted to hide and transport illegal substances. At least one modern smuggler has tried to use this method.&lt;ref name="2009 Australian customs finds heroin in dress buttons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.customs.gov.au/site/Heroinconcealedindressbuttons.asp|title=heroin concealed in dress buttons|last=Australian Government|date=12 November 2009 |publisher=Customs and Border Protection Communication and Media|accessdate=11 March 2010|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also making use of the storage possibilities of metal buttons, during the [[World Wars]], [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[U.S. military]] [[locket]] buttons were made, containing miniature working [[compass]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Luscomb|2003|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials and manufacture==
[[File:Button stamping machine, Henri Jamorski Button Factory, Paris, France, 1919 (28206559760).jpg|right|thumb|Button stamping machine,&lt;br&gt;Henri Jamorski Button Factory,&lt;br&gt;Paris, France, 1919]]
{{see also|List of raw materials used in button-making}}

Because buttons have been manufactured from almost every possible material, both [[Natural materials|natural]] and [[Synthetic chemical|synthetic]], and combinations of both, the history of the material composition of buttons reflects the [[timeline of materials technology]].

Buttons can be individually crafted by [[artisans]], [[craftspeople]] or [[artists]] from [[raw materials]] or [[found objects]] (for example [[fossils]]), or a combination of both. Alternatively, they can be the product of [[low-tech]] [[cottage industry]] or can be [[Mass-production|mass-produced]] in [[High-tech#High-tech industries|high-tech]] [[factories]]. Buttons made by artists are [[art object]]s, known to button collectors as "studio buttons" (or simply "studios", from [[studio craft]]).&lt;ref name="Studio buttons at Button Country"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buttoncountry.com/studios.htm |title=Studios  (Section 23-11) |last=Peach State Button Club |year=2010 |work=Button Country |publisher=Peach State Button Club |accessdate=11 June 2010 |location=Georgia, USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606190304/http://www.buttoncountry.com/studios.htm |archivedate=6 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 the U.S. Government made an extensive survey of the international button market, which listed buttons made of [[vegetable ivory]], [[metal]], [[glass]], [[galalith]], [[silk]], [[linen]], cotton-covered [[crochet]], [[lead]], [[snap fastener]]s, [[glass]], [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[rubber]], [[antler|buckhorn]], [[wood]], [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], [[bone]], [[leather]], [[paper]], pressed [[cardboard]], [[nacre|mother-of-pearl]], [[celluloid]], [[porcelain]], [[composition doll|composition]], [[tin]], [[zinc]], [[celluloid|xylonite]], [[stone]], cloth-covered wooden forms, and [[papier-mâché]].  Vegetable ivory was said to be the most popular for suits and shirts, and papier-mâché far and away the commonest sort of shoe button.&lt;ref&gt;The United States Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Paper and Stationery Trade of the World, Government Printing Office, 1918&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, hard plastic, seashell, metals, and [[wood]] are the most common materials used in button-making; the others tending to be used only in premium or [[antique]] apparel, or found in [[Button collecting|collections]].

Over 60% of the world's button supply comes from [[Qiaotou, Yongjia County]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/welcome-to-button-town-china/ "A look at China's "Button Town", by Seth Doane, CBS News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5686805 "Chinese 'Button Town' Struggles with Success", by Louisa Lim, NPR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decoration and coating techniques===
Historically, fashions in buttons have also reflected trends in [[Applied aesthetics#Two-dimensional and plastic arts|applied aesthetics]] and the [[Applied arts|applied]] [[visual arts]], with buttonmakers using techniques from [[jewellery making]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[metalworking]], [[weaving]] and others. The following are just a few of the construction and decoration techniques that have been used in button-making:  &lt;!-- Incomplete list. Please help by expanding to it --&gt;

===Styles of attachment===
[[File:Plastic &amp; fabric buttons showing holes &amp; shank.jpg|thumb|right|Three plastic sew-through buttons (left) and one shank, fabric-covered button (right)]]
[[File:ShirtStuds.jpg|thumb|Different examples of shirt studs]]
[[File:Durchsteckknoepfe.jpg|thumb|Plastic studs for bedclothes]]

*'''[[Shank (sewing)|Shank]]''' buttons have a hollow protrusion on the back through which thread is sewn to attach the button.&lt;ref name="Button shanks, various materials &amp; types"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buttoncountry.com/shanks.htm|title=Back Types/Shanks (23-3)|last=Button Country|year=2010|publisher=Peach State Button Club|accessdate=11 March 2010|location=GA, USA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617004046/http://www.buttoncountry.com/shanks.htm|archive-date=17 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Button shanks may be made from a separate piece of the same or a different substance as the button itself, and added to the back of the button, or be carved or moulded directly onto the back of the button, in which latter case the button is referred to by collectors as having a 'self-shank'.
*'''Flat or sew-through''' buttons have holes through which thread is sewn to attach the button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |editor-last=Colton |editor-first=Virginia |title=Complete Guide to Sewing |publisher=Reader's Digest |page=352 |date=1978 |isbn=0-89577-026-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat buttons may be attached by [[sewing machine]] rather than by hand, and may be used with heavy fabrics by working a thread shank to extend the height of the button above the fabric.
*'''Stud''' buttons (also push-through buttons or just studs) are composed from an actual button, connected to a second, button-like element by a narrow metal or plastic bar. Pushed through two opposing holes within what is meant to be kept together, the actual button and its counterpart press it together, keeping it joined. Popular examples of such buttons are shirt studs and [[cufflink]]s.
*'''[[Snap fasteners]]''' (also pressure buttons or press studs) are metal (usually brass) round discs pinched through the fabric. They are often found on clothing, in particular on denim pieces such as pants and jackets. They are more securely fastened to the material. As they rely on a metal rivet attached securely to the fabric, pressure buttons are difficult to remove without compromising the fabric's integrity. They are made of two couples: the male stud couple and the female stud couple. Each couple has one front (or top) and rear (or bottom) side (the fabric goes in the middle).

===Fabric buttons===
*'''Covered buttons''' are fabric-covered forms with a separate back piece that secures the fabric over the knob.
*'''Mandarin buttons''' or [[Frog (fastening)|frogs]] are knobs made of intricately knotted strings. Mandarin buttons are a key element in [[Mandarin dress]] (''[[qipao|Qi Pao]]'' and ''[[cheongsam]]'' in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]), where they are closed with loops. Pairs of mandarin buttons worn as [[cuff link]]s are called '''silk knots'''.
*'''Worked or cloth buttons''' are created by [[embroidery|embroidering]] or [[crochet]]ing tight stitches (usually with [[linen]] [[yarn|thread]]) over a knob or ring called a '''form'''. [[Dorset button]]s, handmade from the 17th century to 1750, are of this type.

===Button sizes===
The size of the button depends on its use. Shirt buttons are generally small, and spaced close together, whereas coat buttons are larger and spaced further apart. Buttons are commonly measured in [[ligne]]s (also called ''[[Line (unit)|lines]]'' and abbreviated ''L''), with 40 lignes equal to 1&amp;nbsp;inch. For example, some standard sizes of buttons are 16 lignes (10.16&amp;nbsp;mm, standard button of men's [[shirt]]s) and 32 lignes (20.32&amp;nbsp;mm, typical button on [[suit (clothes)|suit jackets]]).

The [[United States|American]] National Button Society (NBS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbuttonsociety.org/Home.html |title=Home |publisher=Nationalbuttonsociety.org |accessdate=2011-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; has its own button sizing system which divides button sizes into 'small', 'medium' and 'large'.

==Buttons in museums and galleries==
Some [[museums]] and [[art galleries]] hold culturally, historically, politically, and/or artistically significant buttons in their collections. The [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] has many buttons,&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?offset=0&amp;limit=15&amp;narrow=&amp;q=button&amp;commit=Search&amp;quality=2&amp;objectnamesearch=&amp;placesearch=&amp;after=&amp;after-adbc=AD&amp;before=&amp;before-adbc=AD&amp;namesearch=&amp;materialsearch=&amp;mnsearch=&amp;locationsearch=&amp;listing_type=image&amp;orderby=0&amp;order=0 buttons]&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in its [[Victoria and Albert Museum#Jewellery|jewellery collection]], as does the [[Smithsonian|Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanindian.si.edu/searchcollections/results.aspx?objtype=Sewing+Tools+and+Equipment:+Notions&amp;objid=Button American Indian Buttons made with [[ivory]], [[baleen|whalebone]] and [[ink]]] at the [[National Museum of the American Indian|Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianlegacies.si.edu/objectdescription.cfm?ID=50 Domestic button collection, circa 1935], from [[Washington, D.C.]], at the [[National Museum of American History|Smithsonian National Museum of American History]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&amp;cmd=1&amp;id=63886&amp;img=1&amp;pg=1 Uniform buttons] of the [[United States Postal Service]] at 'Arago', the Smithsonian [[National Postal Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=3704 Silver buttons held in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]'s [[Renwick Gallery]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammond Turner &amp; Sons, a button-making company in [[Birmingham]], hosts an online museum with an image gallery and historical button-related articles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hammond-turner.com/ Hammond Turner &amp; Sons]&lt;/ref&gt; including an 1852 article on button-making by [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hammond-turner.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=9 Dickens article]&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, large button collections are on public display at the Waterbury Button Museum of [[Waterbury, Connecticut]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mattatuckmuseum.org/ The Waterbury Button Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; the Keep Homestead Museum of [[Monson, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keephomesteadmuseum.org/ Keep Homestead Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; which also hosts an extensive button archive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keephomesteadmuseum.org/button.htm online button archive]&lt;/ref&gt;  and in Gurnee, Illinois at The Button Room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebuttonroom.org/ The Button Room]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buttons in politics==
[[File:Bulacanmuseumjf12.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Stud buttons of Gen. [[Gregorio del Pilar]], Marcelo Museum, [[Philippines]]]]

The mainly American tradition of politically significant clothing buttons appears to have begun with the [[First inauguration of George Washington|first presidential inauguration]] of [[George Washington]] in 1789. Known to collectors as "Washington Inaugurals",&lt;ref name="GW Inaugurals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kirkmitchell.tripod.com/CobbGW/index.html |title=J. Harold Cobb's George Washington Inaugural Button Collection |last=Cobb |first=J. Harold |author2=Kirk Mitchell |date=Feb 2, 2005|work=J. Harold Cobb's George Washington Inaugural Button Collection|publisher=Kirk Mitchell|accessdate=13 March 2010|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were made of [[copper]], [[brass]] or [[Sheffield plate]], in large sizes for coats and smaller sizes for breeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Luscomb|2003|pp=214–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made in twenty-two patterns and hand-stamped, they are now extremely valuable [[cultural artifact]]s.

Between about 1840 and 1916, clothing buttons were used in American [[political campaign]]s, and still exist in collections today. Initially, these buttons were predominantly made of brass (though horn and rubber buttons with stamped or moulded designs also exist) and had loop shanks. Around 1860 the badge or [[Pin-back button|pin-back]] style of construction, which replaced the shanks with long pins, probably for use on lapels and ties, began to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Luscomb|2003|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common practice that survived until recent times on campaign buttons and badges was to include the image of [[George Washington]] with that of the candidate in question.

Some of the most famous [[campaign button]]s are those made for [[Abraham Lincoln]]. [[Memorial]] buttons commemorating Lincoln's inaugurations and other life events, including his birth and [[Abraham Lincoln#Assassination|death]], were also made, and are also considered highly collectible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Luscomb|2003|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phobia==
Koumpounophobia, the fear of buttons, is a surprisingly common phobia. Sufferers frequently report being repulsed by the sight of buttons, even on other people, and being unable to wear clothing with them. Sufferers also report buttons being dirty and smelling.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/11/steve-jobss-button-phobia-has-shaped-the-modern-world/#&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gregology.net/reference/koumpounophobia/&lt;/ref&gt; The phobia may bear some passing resemblance to [[trypophobia]] and [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]], but is separate and distinct.

New York: Garland Publishing (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leading man of science and best known as the author of many different works (although he may not have written many of them).&lt;ref name= "Baker"&gt;"The Old English Canon of Byrhtferth of Ramsey", Peter S. Baker. ''Speculum'', Vol. 55, No. 1. (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Manual'' (''Enchiridion''), a scientific textbook, is Byrhtferth's best known work.&lt;ref&gt;Byrhtferth of Ramsey. (2011). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/87049/Byrhtferth-of-Ramsey&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied with [[Abbo of Fleury]], who was invited to [[Ramsey Abbey]] by [[Oswald of Worcester]] to help teach.  Abbo was there during the period 985-987, and became a large influence on Byhrtferth who was interested in the same studies, such as history, logic, astronomy, and mathematics.&lt;ref name= "Fletcher"&gt;''Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England'', Richard Fletcher. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; We do not have contemporary biographies of Byrhtferth, and the only information we have is the one in his ''Manual'' and his ''Preface''.

==Works==

Byrhtferth's signature appears on only two unpublished works, his Latin and Old English ''Manual'', and Latin ''Preface''. He also composed a Latin life of St. [[Egwin]], compiled a chronicle of [[Northumbrian]] history in the 990's, wrote a Latin life of [[Oswald of Worcester]] (the ''Vita Oswaldi'') about the year 1000, and it is suggested that he is responsible for the early sections of the ''Historia regum'', or ''History of the Kings'', attributed to [[Simeon of Durham]].  This last attribution is based on the similarity of the style between Simeon and Byrhtferth.&lt;ref name= "Szarmach et al." /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Fletcher" /&gt; The last of Byrhtferth's works is an unsigned fragment of Old English text on [[computus]] in the Manuscript [[British Library|BL]] Cotton Caligula A.xv, fols. MS 142v-143r.  It is attributed to him because of the stylistic similarity to the Old English that he wrote in ''Manual''.&lt;ref name= "Szarmach et al." /&gt;

Byrhtferth has also been credited with Latin commentaries on [[Bede]]'s ''De natura rerum'' and ''De temporum ratione'' (first attributed to him by John Herwagen) and a ''Vita S. Dunstani'' signed "B" (first attributed to him by Jean Mabillon).&lt;ref name= "Baker" /&gt; However, many scholars argue that these works were not written by Byrhtferth, but instead were a compilation of material by several writers in the late ninth and early tenth centuries.  This is argued because of the smooth, polished style of these works in comparison with the styles of the only signed works ''Manual'' and ''Preface''.&lt;ref name= "Baker" /&gt;

===Preface===

[[St John's College, Oxford]] MS 17 [http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/ms-17/index.htm] contains several computistical works by Bede and Helperic, and a [[computus]] which includes the Latin ''Epilogus'', or ''Preface'', by Byrhtferth.  He also constructed a full-page diagram showing the harmony of the universe, and suggesting correspondences among cosmological, numerological, and physiological aspects of the world.  Other items in the [[manuscript]] may in fact be Byrhtferth, but it cannot be proved.  Also, he may have compiled most of these things from works that [[Abbo of Fleury]] left behind at [[Ramsey Abbey]] after his death.&lt;ref name= "Szarmach et al." /&gt;

===Manual===

[[Bodleian Library|Bodl.]] Ashmole MS 328 preserves Byrhtferth's Latin ''Enchiridion'', or ''Manual''.  It is written in Latin and Old English and the largest part is that of a computus similar to the one in ''Preface''.  It touches on the belief that the divine order of the universe can be perceived through the study of numbers and can be of great reference for the study of medieval number symbolism.&lt;ref name= "Szarmach et al." /&gt; It also contains treatises on rhetorical and grammatical subjects, a table of weights and measures and three theological tracts on the ages of the world, the loosing of Satan and the eight capital sins.&lt;ref name= "Lutz"&gt;''Schoolmasters of the Tenth Century'' Cora E. Lutz.  Archon Books (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadian comics''' refers to [[comics]] and [[cartooning]] by citizens of [[Canada]] or [[Permanent residency in Canada|permanent residents]] of Canada regardless of residence. Canada has [[Official bilingualism in Canada|two official languages]], and distinct comics cultures have developed in [[English Canada|English]] and [[French Canada]].  The English tends to follow [[History of American comics|American trends]], and the French [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian ones]],{{sfn|Beaty|2002|p=222}} with little crossover between the two cultures.  Canadian comics run the gamut of comics forms, including [[Editorial cartoonist|editorial cartooning]], [[comic strip]]s, [[comic book]]s, [[graphic novel]]s, and [[webcomic]]s, and are published in [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, books, and online.  They have received attention in international comics communities{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="New Directions, 1989-2001"}} and have received support from the [[Government of Canada|federal]] and provincial governments, including grants from the [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]].  There are a comics publishers throughout the country, as well as large [[small press]], [[self-publishing]], and [[minicomic]]s communities.

In English Canada many cartoonists, from [[Hal Foster]] to [[Todd McFarlane]], have sought to further their careers by moving to the United States; since the late 20th century increasing numbers have gained international attention while staying in Canada.  During [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], trade restrictions led to the flourishing of a domestic comic book industry, whose black-and-white "[[Canadian Whites]]" contained original stories of heroes such as [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights]] as well as American scripts redrawn by Canadian artists.  The war's end saw American imports and domestic censorship lead to the death of this industry.  The [[Alternative comics|alternative]] and small press communities grew in the 1970s, and by the end of the century [[Dave Sim]]'s ''[[Cerebus]]'' and [[Chester Brown]]'s comics, amongst others, gained international audiences and critical acclaim, and [[Drawn and Quarterly]] became a leader in arts-comics publishing.  In the 21st century, comics have gained wider audiences and higher levels of recognition, especially in the form of graphic novels and webcomics.

In French Canada indigenous comics are called ''[[Quebec comics|BDQ]]'' or ''{{lang|fr|bande dessinée québécoise}}'' ({{IPA-fr|bɑ̃d dɛ.si.ne ke.be.kwaz}})  Cartoons with [[speech balloon]]s in Quebec date to the late 1700s.  ''BDQ'' have alternately flourished and languished throughout Quebec's history as the small domestic market has found it difficult to compete with foreign imports.  Many cartoonists from Quebec have made their careers in the United States.  Since the Springtime of BDQ in the 1970s native comics magazines, such as ''[[Croc (magazine)|Croc]]'' and ''[[Safarir]]'', and comics albums have become more common, though they account for only 5% of total sales in the province.  Since the turn of the 21st century cartoonists such as [[Michel Rabagliati]], [[Guy Delisle]], and the team of [[Maryse Dubuc|Dubuc]] and [[Delaf]] have seen international success in French-speaking Europe and in translation. [[Éditions Mille-Îles]] and [[La Pastèque]] are amongst the domestic publishers that have become increasingly common.

==History==

===English Canada===

[[File:Sir John revises history.jpg|right|thumb|alt=|Prime Minister [[John&amp;nbsp;A. Macdonald]] was a favourite target of [[John Bengough]]'s popular caricatures.]]

====Early history (1759–1910s)====

Brigadier-General [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]]'s cartoons lampooning General James Wolfe in 1759 are recognized as the first examples of political cartooning in Canadian history.{{sfn|Hustak|Monet|2012}}  Cartoons did not have a regular forum in Canada until John Henry Walker's short-lived weekly ''Punch in Canada'' débuted in [[Montreal]] in 1849.  The magazine was a Canadian version of Britain's humorous ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2006|1pp=21-22|2a1=Hustak|2a2=Monet|2y=2012}} and featured cartoons by Walker.  It paved the way for a number of similar short-lived publications, until the success of the more straight-laced ''[[Canadian Illustrated News]]'',{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=22}} published by [[George-Édouard Desbarats]]&lt;ref name="Desbarats" /&gt; beginning in 1869, soon after [[Canadian Confederation]].{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=22}}

In 1873, [[John Wilson Bengough]] founded ''Grip'', a humour magazine in the style of ''Punch'' and the American ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''. It featured a large number of cartoons, especially Bengough's own.  The cartoons tended to be political, and Prime Minister [[John&amp;nbsp;A. Macdonald]] and [[Métis]] rebel leader [[Louis Riel]] were favourite targets.{{sfn|Cook|2000}}&lt;ref name="NBArchives" /&gt;  The [[Pacific Scandal]] in the early 1870s gave Bengough much fodder to raise his reputation as a [[Editorial cartoonist|political caricaturist]].  According to historian [[John Bell (historian)|John Bell]], while Bengough was probably the most significant pre-20th-century Canadian cartoonist, [[Henri Julien]] was likely the most accomplished.  Published widely both at home and abroad, Julien's cartoons appeared in periodicals such as ''Harper's Weekly'' and ''[[Le Monde illustré]]''.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=22}}  In 1888, he gained employment at the ''[[Montreal Star]]'' and became the first full-time newspaper cartoonist in Canada.&lt;ref name="NBArchives" /&gt;

[[File:Palmer Cox - Brownies reading a book.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|[[Palmer Cox]] had an international hit with ''[[The Brownies]]'' in the late 19th and early 20th centuries]]

[[Palmer Cox]], a Canadian [[expatriate]] in the United States, at this time created ''[[The Brownies]]'', a popular, widely [[Merchandising|merchandised]] phenomenon whose first book collection sold over a million copies.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=22}}  Cox began a ''Brownies'' [[comic strip]] in 1898 that was one of the earliest English-language strips, and had begun to use [[speech balloon]]s by the time it ended in 1907.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=23}}

====Age of comic strips (1920s–1930s)====

[[File:Jimmy Frise - Birdseye Center.jpg|thumb|alt=|[[Jimmy Frise]]'s ''Birdseye Center'' (later ''Juniper Junction'') was the longest-running strip in English Canada]]

Canadian cartoonists often found it hard to succeed in the field of comic strips without moving to the US, but in 1921, [[Jimmy Frise]], one of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s drinking buddies during the journalist's days in Toronto, sold ''Life's Little Comedies'' to the ''[[Toronto Star]]''{{'}}s ''[[Star Weekly]]''.  This strip was later retitled ''[[Birdseye Center]]'', and became the longest-running strip in English Canadian history.  In 1947, Frise brought the strip to the ''[[Montreal Standard]]'', where it was renamed ''Juniper Junction''.{{sfn|Bell|2006|pp=27–28}}  [[Nova Scotia]]-born artist [[J.&amp;nbsp;R. Williams]] single-panel strip about rural and small-town life, ''[[Out Our Way]]'', began in 1922 and was syndicated in 700 newspapers at its peak.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=28}}

Two new comic strips appeared on the same day in 1929 in American newspapers and fed the public's desire for escapist entertainment at the dawn of the [[Great Depression]].  They were the first non-humorous adventure strips, and both were [[Literary adaptation|adaptations]].  One was ''[[Buck Rogers#Comic strip|Buck Rogers]]''; the other, ''[[Tarzan]]'', by [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] native [[Hal Foster]], who had worked as illustrator for catalogues from [[Eaton's]] and the [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay Company]] before moving to the US in his late 20s.  Other adventure strips soon followed and paved the way for the genre diversity that was seen in comic strips in the 1930s.  In 1937, Foster began his own strip, ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', which has become his best-known work for Foster's dextrous, realistic artwork.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=33}}  After struggling to support himself at various Toronto-based publications,{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=750}} [[Richard Taylor (cartoonist)|Richard Taylor]], under the pen name "Ric", became a regular at ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=24}} and relocated to the US, where the pay and opportunities for cartoonists were better.{{sfn|Lerner|Williamson|1991|p=750}}

The ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' began to run ''[[Men of the Mounted]]'' in 1933,{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=33}} the first home-grown adventure strip, written by [[Ted McCall]] and drawn by [[Harry Hall (cartoonist)|Harry Hall]].  McCall later penned the strip ''[[Robin Hood and Company]]'', which made its appearance in [[comic books]] when McCall founded [[Anglo-American Publishing]] in 1941.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=34}}

====Golden age: Canadian Whites (1940s)====

{{Main|Canadian Whites}}

The [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] and subsequent [[superhero]] boom began with the release in June 1938 of ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1.  The cover story was the first appearance of [[Superman]], drawn by [[Toronto]]-born [[Joe Shuster]].{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=36}}  Shuster modeled Superman's [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] after his memories of Toronto, and the newspaper [[Clark Kent]] worked for after the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'', which he had [[Newspaper delivery|delivered as a child]].{{sfn|Mietkiewicz|1992}}  These comics crossed the border and quickly gained Canadian fans as well.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=300}}

In December 1940, the War Exchange Conservation Act was passed.  It restricted the importation of goods from the US that were deemed non-essential to combat the [[trade deficit]] Canada had with its neighbours to the south.{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2006|1p=43|2a1=Beaty|2y=2002|2p=221|3a1=Duncan|3a2=Smith|3y=2009|3p=300}}  American comic books were casualties of the Act.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=43}}  In 1941, to fill the void, a number of Canadian comic book publishers sprang up, starting in March with [[Anglo-American Publishing]] in Toronto and [[Maple Leaf Publishing]] in Vancouver. [[Adrian Dingle (cartoonist)|Adrian Dingle]]'s [[Hillborough Studios]] and [[Bell Features]] soon joined them.  The comics printed by these companies had colour covers, but the innards were in [[black-and-white]], and thus collectors call them [[Canadian Whites]].  Superheroes stories were prominent, and the "Whites" often relied on serials to keep readers coming back for more.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=44}}

''[[Better Comics (comics)|Better Comics]]'' from Maple Leaf and ''Robin Hood and Company'' from Anglo-American were the first titles to hit the stands.  ''Robin Hood'' was a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]-sized comic strip reprint magazine, while ''Better'' was made up of original material in traditional comic-book format, and thus can be said to be the first true Canadian comic book.  It included the appearance of the first Canadian superhero, [[Vernon Miller (cartoonist)|Vernon Miller]]'s [[Iron Man (Canadian comics)|Iron Man]].  John Stables, under the pen name [[John St. Ables]], was responsible for ''[[Brok Windsor]]''{{'}}s debut in ''Better'' in the spring of 1944—a fantasy-adventure set far in the "land beyond the mists" in the [[Northern Canada|Canadian North]].  The success of ''Better'' led to a proliferation of titles from Maple Leaf.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=44}}

[[File:Nelvana2Cover.jpg|right|thumb|alt=|[[Adrian Dingle (cartoonist)|Adrian Dingle]]'s [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights]], Canada's first female [[superhero]] ]]

The driving creative forces behind Anglo-American were [[Ted McCall]], the writer of the ''Men of the Mounted'' and ''Robin Hood'' strips, and artist [[Ed Furness]].  The pair created a number of heroes with such names as Freelance, Purple Rider, Red Rover, and Commander Steel.  Anglo-American also published stories based on imported American scripts bought from [[Fawcett Publications]], with fresh artwork by Canadians to bypass trade restrictions. [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Bulletman and Bulletgirl|Bulletman]] were amongst the characters that had Canadian adaptations.  Anglo-American published a large number of titles, including ''Freelance'', ''Grand Slam'', ''Three Aces'', ''Whiz'', ''Captain Marvel'' and ''Atom Smasher'', but relied less on serials, and was less patriotically Canadian than its rival publishers.  It employed a number of talented artists, but they were kept to a "house style" of drawing, in the vein of Captain Marvel's [[C.&amp;nbsp;C. Beck]].{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=45}}

In August 1941, three unemployed artists, [[Adrian Dingle (cartoonist)|Adrian Dingle]] and André and René Kulbach, formed [[Hillborough Studios]] to publish their own work.  They started with ''Triumph-Adventure Comics'', whose star was Canada's first female superhero, [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights]],{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=47}} who appeared several months before [[Wonder Woman]] did in the US.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=48}}  Nelvana was inspired by tribal stories brought back from the Arctic [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] painter [[Franz Johnston]].{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=60}}  The popular fur-miniskirted superheroine was a powerful [[Inuit]] mythological figure, daughter of a mortal woman and Koliak the Mighty, King of the Northern Lights.  She had [[Telepathy|telepathic powers]] and was able to ride the [[Aurora (astronomy)|Northern Lights]] at the speed of light, turn invisible, and melt metal.{{sfn|Bell|2001|loc="Superhero Profiles: Nelvana of the Northern Lights"}}

In March 1942, Dingle and most of the Hillborough staff moved with Nelvana to Toronto-based [[Bell Features]], which had begun publishing comics in September 1941 with the first issue of the successful ''Wow Comics''—in colour at first, but Bell soon switched to the familiar "White" format.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=48}}  Bell was the most prolific of the Canadian comic-book publishers.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=50}}  Its comics were drawn by a large pool of artists, including freelancers, adolescents, and women, and were unabashedly Canadian.  Aside from Nelvana, there were Edmund Legault's Dixon of the Mounted, Jerry Lazare's Phantom Rider, and Fred Kelly's Doc Stearne.  Leo Bachle's [[Johnny Canuck]] was the second Canadian national hero, and debuted in Bell's ''Dime Comics'' in February 1942.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=48}}

The new Canadian comics were successful; Bell reached accumulated weekly sales of 100,000 by 1943.  By this time, [[Educational Projects]] of [[Montreal|Montréal]] had joined, selling comics in the "White" format.  Educational specialized in a different sort of fare: biographies of prime ministers, cases of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]], and historical tales, drawn by accomplished artists including George&amp;nbsp;M. Rae and [[Sid Barron]].  Educational's ''Canadian Heroes'' earned endorsements from cabinet ministers and appealed to parents and educators, but was not as appealing to the kids it was aimed at until Rae convinced publisher Harry&amp;nbsp;J. Halperin to allow him to include a fictional character, [[Canada Jack]]—a hero who battled [[Nazi]]s.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=50}}

With the end of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] in 1945, Canadian comic-book publishing faced competition from American publishers again.  Educational and latecomer Feature Publications folded immediately.  Maple Leaf tried to compete by switching to colour and by trying to break into the British market.  Anglo-American and another newcomer, Al Rucker Publications, tried to compete directly with the Americans, and even achieved distribution in the US.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=52}}  By the end of 1946 it was clear that the remaining publishers could not compete, and for the time being original comic-book publishing came to an end in Canada, although some publishers like [[Bell Features]] survived by republishing American books until the War Exchange Conservation Act was officially abolished in 1951.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=70}} The cartoonists who insisted on drawing for a living faced several choices: some moved across the border to attempt to make it with the American publishers, and some moved into illustration work, as Jerry Lazare, Vernon Miller, [[Jack Tremblay]], and [[Harold Bennett]] did.  Another avenue was the route Sid Barron followed into political cartooning.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=56}}  By 1949, out of 176 comics titles on the newsstand, only 23 were Canadian.{{sfn|Adams|1997|p=144}}

====Post-war (late 1940s–early 1970s)====

With the end of most original Canadian comic book publishing in 1947, Canada's superheroes disappeared, and the country entered a phase of foreign comic book domination. In November 1948, a [[crime comics]] scare hit the country when a pair of voracious comic book readers in [[Dawson Creek]], [[British Columbia]], shot at a random car while playing highwaymen, fatally wounding a passenger. When authorities discovered their taste for comic books, media attention focused on the emerging [[crime comics]] genre as an influence on [[juvenile delinquency]].&lt;ref name="crackdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/comics/027002-8400-e.html |title=ARCHIVED - Crackdown on Comics, 1947-1966 |first=John |last=Bell |work=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bill to amend Section 207 of the Criminal Code was drafted, and passed unanimously, making it an offense to make, print, publish, distribute, sell, or own "any magazine, periodical or book which exclusively or substantially comprises matter depicting pictorially the commission of crimes, real or fictitious",{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2002|1loc="Crackdown on Comics, 1947-1966"|2a1=Adams|2y=1997|2p=149}} on 10 December 1949. Comics publishers across Canada banded together to create the Comic Magazine Industry Association of Canada (CMIAC), a Canadian industry self-censoring body similar to the American [[Comics Code Authority]] that would be formed a few years later in response to a similar crime comics scare in the U.S.&lt;ref name="crackdown"/&gt; Purely by coincidence, the [[Netherlands]] had experienced a [[Dutch comics#1948: Crisis|near-similar comics related incident]] at almost exactly the same time with an equally lethal outcome, and causing a similar popular reaction, but in this case the authorities refrained from taking the drastic legal actions, their Canadian counterparts did.

[[Superior Publishers]], however, defied the ban, while also moving into the U.S. market. Watchdogs turned up the heat, and in 1953 a distributor was found guilty of distributing obscenities. Some of Superior's titles found themselves in [[Fredric Wertham]]'s notorious and influential diatribe on the influence comics had on juvenile delinquency, ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'', published in 1954. The [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]], established in 1953, had [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency#1954 comic book hearings|public hearings]] a few months later, and called upon [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[E. Davie Fulton]], one of Superior publisher William Zimmerman's most outspoken enemies, as a witness. The Comics Code Authority was soon formed, and Superior, like fellow American publisher [[EC Comics]], saw their sales dwindle throughout 1955. Prosecutions increased throughout Canada, with Superior successfully defending themselves in one, and another supposedly comics-related murder was reported in [[Westville, Nova Scotia]]. Superior shut its doors in 1956, and until the 1970s, English Canadian newsstand comic book publishing was no more, although a number of "giveaway" comics continued to be produced by Orville {{not a typo|Ganes}}' {{not a typo|Ganes}} Productions and [[Owen McCarron]]'s Comic Book World, who produced the educational and cautionary comics for governments and corporations, aimed at kids and teens.&lt;ref name="crackdown"/&gt;

[[File:Doug Wright - Nipper 1953-10-17 last panel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doug Wright (cartoonist)|Doug Wright]]'s ''Nipper'' was a mainstay in Canadian newspapers in the post-war years]]

The crackdown was not aimed at comic strips, however, and several notable new ones appeared, like Lew Saw's ''One-Up'', Winslow Mortimer's ''Larry Brannon'' and Al Beaton's ''Ookpik''.&lt;ref name="crackdown"/&gt; After [[Jimmy Frise]]'s death in 1948, ''[[Juniper Junction]]'' was taken over by [[Doug Wright (cartoonist)|Doug Wright]], "one of Canada's best post-war comic-strip artists".{{sfn|Bell|2006|pp=27–28}} He would continue with the strip until 1968, while also working on his own ''Nipper'' from 1949. In 1967, ''Nipper'' became ''Doug Wright's Family'' when Wright moved from Montreal to Ontario, and the popular strip continued until 1980.&lt;ref name="WrightAwardsWrightBio" /&gt; The [[Doug Wright Award]]s were inaugurated in his honour in 2005. From 1948 to 1972, [[James Simpkins|James Simpkins']] cartoon Jasper the Bear appeared continuously in [[Maclean's|Maclean's magazine]].  Jasper was hugely popular across Canada and was used, and is still today, as the symbol for [[Jasper National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=James Simpkins, 1910-2004 Biographical Sketch |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|author=|location=|date=|accessdate=Oct 17, 2012|url=http://data4.collectionscanada.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=&amp;s2=&amp;s3=165&amp;l=20&amp;Sect4=AND&amp;Sect1=IMAGE&amp;Sect2=THESOFF&amp;Sect5=BIPHPEN&amp;Sect6=HITOFF&amp;d=BIPH&amp;p=1&amp;u=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/02/02015502_e.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To express his anger at the US military's [[Operation Crossroads|nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll]] in 1946 English-born artist [[Laurence Hyde (artist)|Laurence Hyde]] produced a [[wordless novel]] in 1951 called ''[[Southern Cross (wordless novel)|Southern Cross]]''.  In 118 silent pages, the book depicts [[Nuclear weapons testing|atomic testing]] by the US military and its effects [[Polynesia]]n island inhabitants.  While it had no direct effect on comics at the time, it has come to be seen as a precursor to the Canadian graphic novel.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=103}}

Early [[Editorial cartoonist|editorial cartooning]] lacked a local flavour, tending to be a pale imitation of American examples. It tended to be cheery, non-confrontational, and supported good causes. Following the War it broke from typical American clichés and took on more of a savage bite, especially compared to the more allegorical tendencies of American editorial cartoons. At ''[[Le Devoir]]'', Robert Lapalme was the first to cartoon in this particularly Canadian idiom, and in 1963 organized an International Salon of Caricature and Cartoon in Montreal. Lapalme was later followed by [[Duncan Macpherson]] at the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', Leonard Norris at the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' and Ed McNally at the ''[[Montreal Star]]''. These cartoonists frequently took political positions contrary to those of the papers in which they were published.{{sfn|Hustak|Monet|2012}}&lt;ref name="NBArchives" /&gt; Macpherson drew a cartoon of [[John Diefenbaker]] as [[Marie Antoinette]] saying "Let them eat cake" in response to the Prime Minister's cancelling the [[Avro Arrow]] project, which historian [[Pierre Burton]] has called the beginning of Canadians' disillusionment with Diefenbaker's government.{{sfn|Mlynek|1999}} Macpherson in particular fought fiercely for editorial independence, challenging his editors and threatening to quit the ''Star'' if not given his way, which paved a new path for other cartoonists to follow.{{sfn|Hustak|Monet|2012}}

In the spring of 1966, Canada saw its first specialty [[comic shop]] open its doors on Queen Street West, Toronto: Viking Bookshop, established by "Captain George" Henderson. Entirely unfamiliar with the new phenomenon, the store was dubbed "the campiest store in town" by ''Toronto Star'' reporter Robert Fulford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torontoist.com/2015/09/vintage-toronto-ads-memory-lane/ | title=Vintage Toronto Ads: Memory Lane &amp;ndash; The story of "Captain George" Henderson, Toronto's first retailer to specialize in comic books. | first=Jamie |last=Bradburn | work=torontoist.com |date=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; No longer in existence, Viking Bookshop is currently the earliest known such specialty comic book store in North-America (or worldwide for that matter), predating the oldest known US comic book store, [[Gary Arlington]]'s San Francisco Comic Book Company (est. April 1968), by two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/comics/underground.htm |title=Comics History: Underground comix and the underground press |work=lambiek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, in May 1967, the store was renamed Memory Lane Books after it had relocated to Markham Street in the same city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdaily.com/championing_comics/progressive-shops/canadas-first-comic-shop/ |title=Canada's 1st Comic Shop? |first=Scott | last=VanderPloeg |date=14 September 2011 |work=comicbookdaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such became an inspiration for pioneering retailer Harry Kremer and Bill Johnson to open [[Now &amp; Then Books]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. Its newsletter, the ''Now and Then Times'', published early work by the young [[Dave Sim]] in its inaugural issue in 1972, and later employed him from 1976 to 1977.&lt;ref name="SequentialNowThen" /&gt;

In the late 1960s, along with the [[Counterculture|countercultural]] movement, a new form of comic art appeared from the [[avant-garde]] and literary scenes—[[Underground comix|underground comics]] (or "comix") aimed at an adult audience. Early examples appeared in certain magazines, but an early precursor of Canadian underground comic books was ''Scraptures'', as a special issue of the Toronto avant-garde literary magazine ''[[GrOnk (magazine)|grOnk]]'' in 1967. In 1969, Canada saw its first true underground comics, with ''SFU Komix'' and ''Snore Comix''. These comix drew their inspiration from the American underground movement that exploded after the release of [[Robert Crumb]]'s ''[[Zap Comix|Zap]]'' in early 1968. Martin Vaugh-James produced an early [[graphic novel]] when he had ''Elephant'' released by Press Porcépic in 1970. The underground movement paralleled that of the US, in that it peaked from 1970 to 1972 with the peak of the counterculture, and witnessed a sharp decline afterward. [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]'s [[Dave Geary]] and [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]'s [[Rand Holmes]] were key figures, Holmes being the creator of the ''Harold Hedd'' comic strip.{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="Comix Rebellion, 1967-1974"}}

Humour magazine ''Fuddle Duddle'', named after a [[Fuddle duddle|famous euphemism]] by then-Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], was a short lived attempt at a Canadian ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''-style satirical magazine. It was the first comic book of Canadian content to be available on newsstands since 1956. Two of its contributors, Peter Evans and [[Stanley Berneche]], would soon go on to bring superheroes back to Canada for the first time since the demise of [[Nelvana of the Northern Lights|Nelvana]] in 1947, with [[Captain Canuck]].{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="Comix Rebellion, 1967-1974"}}

The fan press and [[fandom]] grew throughout this period, and was bolstered when [[Patrick Loubert]] and [[Michael Hirsh (producer)|Michael Hirsh]], the founders of the animation company [[Nelvana]], published of ''[[The Great Canadian Comic Books]]'' in 1971,{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=71}} a book-length study of the [[Bell Features]] comics, and the touring of a related exhibition mounted by the [[National Gallery of Canada]], ''Comic Art Traditions in Canada, 1941-45'', which together served to introduce English-Canadian comics creators and fans to their lost heritage.{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="Comix Rebellion, 1967-1974"}}

Towards the middle of the 1970s, comics aimed at children gradually disappeared. The new breed of underground, alternative and independent comics was aimed at a more mature audience, which ran counter to the public's perception, as well as to legal restrictions. The first wave of alternative comics in the seventies was largely made up of [[science fiction]] and fantasy comics, made by budding cartoonists like [[Gene Day]], [[Dave Sim]], Augustine Funnell, [[Jim Craig (cartoonist)|Jim Craig]], [[Ken Steacy]], [[Dean Motter]], and Vincent Marchesano.{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="Comix Rebellion, 1967-1974"}}

====New wave (mid-1970s–1980s)====
The mid-1970s saw the beginning of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. [[Richard Comely]]'s [[Captain Canuck]] appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=121}} This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed [[Orb (comics magazine)|''Orb'']], which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.{{sfn|Bell|2006|pp=121-122}}

The comics magazines showing up in Canada at the time suffered from promotion and distribution problems, however, getting most of their support from the fan press. [[Phil Seuling]]'s [[California]]-based comics distributor [[Bud Plant]] was supportive of these [[Underground comix|underground]] and [[Alternative comics|alternative]] comics, though, and helped get them into stores. Eventually, distributors like Bud Plant and the emergence of specialty [[comic shop]]s would form a distribution network for [[small press]] comics that would thrive independently of the traditional newsstands.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=122}}

[[File:FBorFW Patterson family.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lynn Johnston]]'s ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', the most widely distributed Canadian comic strip ]]
The world of comic strips saw a number of works pop up. [[Ben Wicks]] was doing ''The Outsiders'' and ''Wicks'', [[Jim Unger]]'s ''[[Herman (comic strip)|Herman]]'' debuted in 1975, and Ted Martin's ''Pavlov'' in 1979.{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="Alternative Visions, 1975-1988"}} In 1978, [[Lynn Johnston]], living in [[Lynn Lake, Manitoba]], began ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', which was noted for following the lives of the Patterson family as they grew older in [[real time (media)|real time]], and dealt with real-life issues. The strip based a number of its storylines on Johnston's real-life experiences with her own family, as well as social issues such as the [[midlife crisis]], [[divorce]], the [[coming out]] of a [[Homosexuality|gay]] character,{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="New Directions, 1989-2001"}} [[child abuse]], and [[death]]. In 1985, she became the first female cartoonist to win a [[Reuben Award]],{{sfn|Astor|2007}} and the [[Friends of Lulu]] added her to the [[List of Lulu Award winners|Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame]] in 2002. The strip was very popular, appearing in over 2000 newspapers{{sfn|Astor|2007}} in 25 countries.{{sfnm|1a1=Bell|1y=2002|1loc="New Directions, 1989-2001"|2a1=Bell|2y=2006|2p=184}}

Editorial cartoonists held considerable sway between the 1950s through the 1970s. Former Prime Minister [[Joe Clark]] has been quoted that he lost votes in the [[Canadian federal election, 1980|election of 1980]] due to political cartoons about him.{{sfn|Mlynek|1999}} They have also experienced the fear of censorship through the courts, or "[[Chilling effect (law)|libel chill]]". In 1979, Robert Bierman and the ''[[Times Colonist|Victoria Times]]'' was the subject of a [[libel]] suit when he criticized the policies of [[William Vander Zalm]], the [[British Columbia]] Minister of Human Resources, with a cartoon of the Minister pulling the wings off flies. When the courts ruled in Vander Zalm's favour, newspapers across the nation ran their own versions of the cartoon in support, until the BC Court of Appeal reversed the ruling in 1980, deeming the cartoon "[[fair comment]]". It was later acquired by the [[National Archives of Canada]].&lt;ref name="NBArchives" /&gt;{{sfnm|1a1=Rayner|1y=2000|1p=213|2a1=Hawthorn|2y=2008}}

[[File:Dave Sim and Cerebus.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dave Sim]] proselytized [[self-publishing]] and [[Creator's Bill of Rights|creators' rights]] while pushing artistic boundaries with his series, ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]]''.]]
''Captain Canuck'' and ''Orb'' both folded by 1976, but in [[Kitchener, Ontario]] in December 1977, [[Dave Sim]]'s independent comic book ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]]'' debuted, and would become the longest-lived original Canadian comic book.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=124}} Benefiting from distribution in the emerging comic shop market,{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=302}} it started as a ''[[Howard the Duck]]''-like [[parody]] of [[Barry Windsor-Smith]]'s ''[[Conan (comics)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' comics. The story eventually grew to fit Sim's expanding ambitions, both in content and technique, with its [[Aardvark|earth-pig]] protagonist getting embroiled in politics, becoming prime minister of a powerful [[city-state]], then a [[Pope]] who ascends to the moon—all within the first third of its projected 300-issue run. Sim came to conceive the series as a self-enclosed story, which itself would be divided into [[novel]]s—or [[graphic novels]], which were gaining in prominence in the North American comic book world in the 1980s and 1990s. While Sim and his partner [[Gerhard (cartoonist)|Gerhard]]'s technical achievements impressed and influenced his peers, Sim also spoke out for [[Creator's Bill of Rights|creators' rights]], promoted his peers and up-and-coming creators, and fiercely promoted [[self-publishing]] as an ideal. Americans [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] with ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' and [[Terry Moore (comics)|Terry Moore]] with ''[[Strangers in Paradise]]'' took Sim's cue, as did Canadian [[M'Oak]] (Mark Oakley) with his long-running ''[[Thieves and Kings]]''. [[Eddie Campbell]] took Sim's personal advice to self-publish the collected ''[[From Hell]]'' at the turn of the century.{{sfn|Campbell|2011}} Sim also stirred considerable controversy, sometimes with the content of ''Cerebus'', and sometimes with his editorials and personal interactions.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=124}}

[[David Boswell]] was amongst those in the 1980s who made the jump from the fanzine world when he began self-publishing ''Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman'' in 1980.{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="Alternative Visions, 1975-1988"}} From out of the same scene,{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="Alternative Visions, 1975-1988"}} [[Bill Marks]] started publishing the anthology ''Vortex'' in Toronto in 1982.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=126}} Marks' [[Vortex Comics]] expanded into publishing other comics. The publisher gained publicity for ''[[Mister X (Vortex)|Mister X]]'', which employed the talents of [[Dean Motter]], [[Gilberto Hernandez|Gilberto]] and [[Jaime Hernandez]] and, later, Torontonians [[Seth (cartoonist)|Seth]] and [[Jeffrey Morgan (writer)|Jeffrey Morgan]]. Most notably, Marks picked up [[Chester Brown]]'s ''[[Yummy Fur (comics)|Yummy Fur]]'', a taboo-breaking series which started in 1983 as a self-published, [[Photocopier|photocopied]] [[minicomic]]. It had generated some buzz, and Vortex started publishing it professionally at the end of 1986. ''Yummy Fur''{{'}}s stories were a mix of genres, with the improvised, surreal ''[[Ed the Happy Clown]]'', [[Chester Brown's Gospel adaptations|straight adaptations]] of the [[Gospels]], and revealing, bare-all [[Chester Brown's autobiographical comics|autobiographical stories]]. Brown would become a major figure in Canadian comics.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=126}}

As the content of comics matured throughout the 1980s, they became the subject of increasing scrutiny. In 1986, [[Calgary]] comic shop Comic Legends was raided and charged with [[Obscenity#Canada obscenity law|obscenity]]. In response, [[Derek McCulloch (comics)|Derek McCulloch]] and Paul Stockton of [[Strawberry Jam Comics]] established the [[Comic Legends Legal Defense Fund]] to help retailers, distributors, publishers, and creators fight against obscenity charges. To raise funds, they published two ''True North'' anthologies of Canadian talent.{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="Alternative Visions, 1975-1988"}}

During this time, large numbers of Canadian artists were making waves in the American comic book market as well, such as [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], [[Gene Day]] and his brother Dan, Jim Craig, [[Rand Holmes]], [[Geof Isherwood]], [[Ken Steacy]], [[Dean Motter]], [[George Freeman (comics)|George Freeman]] and [[Dave Ross (comics)|Dave Ross]].{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=128}} Byrne was particularly popular for his work on ''[[X-Men]]'', and also originated ''[[Alpha Flight]]'', about a team of Canadian superheroes.{{sfn|Beaty|2002|p=222}}

====1990s====
In 1990, [[Montreal]]-based publisher [[Drawn and Quarterly]] began with an anthology title also named ''Drawn and Quarterly''. It quickly picked up a number of other titles, such as [[Julie Doucet]]'s semi-autobiographical, bilingual ''[[Dirty Plotte]]'', which, like ''Yummy Fur'', had started out as a [[minicomic]]; Seth's ''[[Palookaville (comics)|Palookaville]]''; illegal resident from the US [[Joe Matt]]'s ''[[Peepshow (comics)|Peepshow]]''; and ''Yummy Fur'', which made the jump with its twenty-fifth issue. At the time, an [[autobiographical comics]] trend took place. Brown, Seth and Matt in particular were thought of as a Toronto comics [[rat pack]], depicting one another in their comics and doing signings and interviews together.{{sfn|Weisblott|2008}}

Drawn and Quarterly was at the forefront of the maturation comic books saw in the 1990s, publishing and promoting the works of adult-oriented Canadian and international artists. The publisher avoided genres like superheroes, which publisher [[Chris Oliveros]] saw as stifling comics' growth.{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="New Directions, 1989-2001"}} These comics had artistic aspirations,{{sfn|Beaty|2002|p=223}} and [[graphic novel]]s became increasingly prominent, with Brown's autobiographical ''[[The Playboy: A Comic Book|The Playboy]]'' and ''[[I Never Liked You]]'', and Seth's faux-autobiographical ''[[It's a Good Life, If You Don't Weaken]]'' garnering considerable attention.

[[Todd McFarlane]] from [[Calgary]] had been making waves since the late 1980s illustrating comics for [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics]], becoming a fan favourite writer/artist for ''[[Spider-Man]]''. He eventually left to co-found the [[Creator ownership|creator-owned]] comics publishing collective [[Image Comics]], where he debuted the enormously successful ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]''. ''Spawn'' holds the record for most copies sold of an independent comic,{{sfn|Lipton|1997}} and was the most financially successful comics franchise of the decade.{{sfnm|1a1=Beaty|1y=2002|1p=222|2a1=Duncan|2a2=Smith|2y=2009|2p=303}}

====21st century====
[[File:Rielcomicstripcover.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[Chester Brown]]'s best-selling ''[[Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography|Louis Riel]]'' was the first work in comics to receive a [[Canada Council]] grant. ]]
At the dawn of the 21st Century, the comics industry had changed considerably. The [[graphic novel]] had come into its own, and traditional comics sales dropped significantly. [[Louis Riel]], who had been a major target of [[John Bengough]]'s caricatures in the early days of Confederation, was the protagonist in [[Chester Brown]]'s award-winning, best-selling{{sfn|Tousley|2005}} "[[Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography|comic-strip biography]]". With his graphic novels and book collections, he gained a wider audience than he had with his serial comic books,{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=302}} and he abandoned serial comics entirely to focus on original graphic novels after ''Louis Riel''. Greater appreciation of the artform was shown when Brown and Seth became recipients of grants from the [[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]].{{sfnm|1a1=Daffern|1y=2011|2a1=Weisblott|2y=2011}} Dave Sim's ''Cerebus'' completed its planned 26-year, 300-issue run in 2004.{{sfnm|1a1=Duncan|1a2=Smith|1y=2009|1p=302|2a1=Bell|2y=2006|2p=176}}

Foreign comics, especially [[Manga|Japanese]], became quite successful in Canada, and stood out for gaining large numbers of female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books.&lt;ref name="MangaCraze" /&gt; They also had a significant influence on artists such as [[Bryan Lee O'Malley]] and his ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'' series.{{sfn|Booker|2010|p=386}} Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them as [[child pornography]] and result in jail terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Wagner|1y=2011|2a1=Thompson|2y=2011}}

Drawn and Quarterly has become known as a house for art comics, translations of non-English works, like Montrealer [[Michel Rabagliati]]'s ''Paul'' series,{{sfn|Chung|2011}} and archive editions of classic comics, such as [[Doug Wright II|Wright]]'s ''Little Nipper''. The publisher has earned a reputation for the special attention they put into book design, and has played a pivotal rôle in shaping comics' rise in artistic prominence, and in getting comics into mainstream book stores in both Canada and the US.{{sfn|McBride|2009}} D&amp;Q publisher [[Chris Oliveros]], along with [[Art Spiegelman]], lobbied bookstores to include a section for graphic novels, which would be subdivided by subject.{{sfn|McGrath|2004|p=2}}

[[Webcomics]], such as [[Kate Beaton]]'s ''[[Hark! A Vagrant]]'', [[Ryan Sohmer]] and [[Lar deSouza]]'s ''[[Looking for Group]]'', and [[Karl Kerschl]]'s ''[[The Abominable Charles Christopher]]'', became an increasingly popular outlet for Canadian cartoonists.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=184}} The popularity of Beaton's work has led to it being published in book form, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine placing it in the top 10 fiction books of 2011.{{sfn|Grossman|2011}}

The comics community in Canada has grown, and has grown appreciative of its talent, celebrating it with awards such as the [[Doug Wright Award|Doug Wrights]] and [[Joe Shuster Award|Joe Shusters]],{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=187}} as well as with classy events such as the international [[Toronto Comic Arts Festival]], which has been cosponsored by the [[Toronto Public Library]] since 2009.{{sfn|Braga|2011}}

===French Canada===
{{Main|Quebec comics}}
The comics of Québec, also known as "BDQ" (''bande dessinée québécoise''), have followed a different path than those of English Canada. While newspapers tend to populate their funny pages with [[Print syndication|syndicated]] American [[comic strip]]s, in general comics there have followed [[Franco-Belgian comics]], with ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' being particularly popular and influential. Comics also tend to be printed in the [[comic album]] format that is popular in Europe.{{sfn|Viau|2002|loc="Publishing Comics"}} Aside from humorous parodies, there is no superhero tradition in Québec comics.{{sfnm|1a1=Beaty|1y=2002|1p=222|2a1=Bell|2y=2001|2loc="Smashing the Axis"}}

====Early history (1790s–1960s)====
[[File:Raoul Barré - Pour un diner de Noel.jpg|right|thumb|"Pour un dîner de Noël" (Raoul Barré, 1902), the first [[comic strip]] to appear in a daily Québec newspaper. Barré demonstrates an interest in movement, which he would develop later as a pioneer in [[animation]] ]]
Québec comics have alternately flourished and languished, seeing several brief periods of intense activity followed by long periods of inundation with foreign content. Comics first appeared in the humour pages of newspapers in the 19th century, following the trends coming from Europe. In the late 19th Century, [[Henri Julien]] published two books of political caricatures, ''L'album drolatique du journal Le Farceur'', after which the number of cartoonists began to increase in newspapers in [[Québec City]] and [[Montreal]]. 1904 saw, in the newspaper ''[[La Patrie (Canadian newspaper)|La Patrie]]'', the publication of ''[[Les Aventures de Timothée]]'' (''The Adventures of Timothée'') by [[Albéric Bourgeois]]. This is said to be the first French-language comic to feature [[speech balloons]].{{sfn|Viau|2002|loc="Newspaper Strips of the 20th Century"}} Joseph Charlebois's comic-strip adaptation of ''Le Père Ladébauche'' (Father Debauchery) also debuted in 1904, in ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', a popular strip that would last until 1957.{{sfn|Swift|2012}}

[[Raoul Barré]] had the first comic strip to appear in a Québec daily newspaper in 1902, called ''"Pour un dîner de Noël"'' ("For a Christmas Dinner").{{sfn|Viau|2002|loc="Newspaper Strips of the 20th Century"}} In 1912, he created a strip called ''Noahzark Hotel'' for the [[New York City|New York]]-based [[McClure Syndicate]], which he brought to ''[[La Patrie (Canadian newspaper)|La Patrie]]'' in French the next year. Soon after he moved into [[animation]], becoming an innovative pioneer in the field.{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=27}}

Québécois cartoonists would propose a number of strips to compete with the American strips that dominated the Sundays and dailies. The native Québec presence on those pages would become more dominant after 1940, however, with the introduction of the War Exchange Conservation Act, which restricted the import of foreign strips. [[Albert Chartier]] created the comical character ''[[Onésime]]'' in 1943, a strip that would have the longest run of any in Québec.{{sfn|Swift|2012}} After [[World War II]], during the [[Grande Noirceur|Great Darkness]], comics publication became dominated with religious comics, most of which were imported from the US. Native Québec comics did flourish for a brief period between 1955 and 1960, however, but were soon replaced again with American content, while also facing competition from the new [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian]] publications, which appeared in full-colour, and by the mid-1960s had put the local Catholic publications out of business.{{sfn|Viau|2002|loc="Comics During the 'Great Darkness'"}}

====Springtime of BDQ (1970s–present)====
The revolutionary 1960s and the [[Quiet Revolution]] in Québéc saw a new vigour in BDQ. What Georges Raby called the Spring of Québécois comics{{sfn|Beaty|2002|p=222}} (''printemps de la BD québécoise'') is said to have begun in 1968 with the creation of the group Chiendent, who published in ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' and ''Dimanche-Magazine''. Jacques Hurtubise ([[Zyx (cartoonist)|Zyx]]), Réal Godbout, Gilles Thibault, and Jacques Boivin were particularly notable cartoonists, and numerous short-lived publications with strange names appeared, like ''Ma®de in Québec'' and ''L'Hydrocéphale illustré''. The comics no longer focused on younger audiences, instead seeking confrontation or experimenting with graphics,{{sfn|Swift|2012}} drawing influence from French comics for mature audiences like those published in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine, as well as translations of American [[Underground comix|undergrounds]], translations of which were published in the journal ''Mainmise''.{{sfn|Beaty|2002|p=222}} During the 1970s, BDQ were sometimes called "BDK", ''bande dessinée kébécoise''.{{sfn|Carpentier|1975}}

[[File:Croc magazines.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Croc (magazine)|Croc]]'' was a popular outlet for Québec cartoonists in the 1980s]]
In 1979, Jacques Hurtubise, [[Pierre Huet (cartoonist)|Pierre Huet]] and [[Hélène Fleury]] would establish the long-lived, satirical ''[[Croc (magazine)|Croc]]'', which published many leading talents of the era, many of whom were able to launch their careers through the magazine's help. ''Croc'' begat another magazine, ''Titanic'', dedicated to comic strips, and in 1987, ''[[Safarir]]'', a ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]''-like publication patterned after the French ''[[Hara-Kiri (magazine)|Hara-Kiri]]'', rose in competition with ''Croc''. By the mid-1980s, a number of professional comics publishers began to flourish.{{sfn|Swift|2012}}

In Montreal in the 1980s and 1990s, in parallel to mainstream humour magazines, a healthy underground scene developed, and self-published fanzines proliferated. [[Julie Doucet]], [[Henriette Valium]], [[Luc Giard]], [[Eric Theriault|Éric Thériault]], [[Gavin McInnes]] and Siris were among the names that were discovered in the small press publications.{{sfn|Swift|2012}}

[[File:Michel Rabagliati 2010.jpg|right|thumb|[[Michel Rabagliati]]'s semi-[[Autobiography|autobiographical]] comics have had international success, in French and in translation]]
In the 21st Century, [[Michel Rabagliati]] and his semi-[[Autobiography|autobiographical]] ''Paul'' series has seen [[Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]-like sales levels in Québec, and his books have been published in English by [[Drawn and Quarterly]].{{sfn|Chung|2011}}

Around the turn of the century, the government of Québec mandated La Fondation du 9e art ("The [[Ninth art|9th Art]] Foundation") to promote francophone cartoonists in North America. There have also emerged events such as the Festival de la bande dessinée francophone de Québec in [[Quebec City|Québec City]] and la Zone internationale du neuvième art (ZINA).{{sfn|Swift|2012}}

==Publication, promotion and distribution==

As in the US, large Canadian newspapers typically have a page of comic strips in their daily editions and a full-colour [[Sunday comics]] section on Saturdays or Sundays. [[Editorial cartoonist]]s are also common; the [[Association of Canadian Editorial Cartoonists]] is a professional association founded in 1988 to promote their interests.&lt;ref name="NBArchives" /&gt;

There are a number of English- and French-language publishers active in Canadian comics. [[Drawn and Quarterly]] is a Montreal-based English-language publisher of arts comics, translations, and classic comic reprints.  Founded by [[Chris Oliveros]] in 1990, Drawn and Quarterly is one of the most influential publishers in [[alternative comics]].{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=302}} [[Arcana Studio]] of [[British Columbia]] publishes a large number of titles, and [[Koyama Press]] joined the fray in 2007.  In French, [[Les 400 coups]], [[Mécanique Générale]], [[La Pastèque]] and the Québec arm of [[Glénat (publisher)|Glénat]] are amongst the active publishers.  The [[small press]] has played an important rôle;{{sfn|Bell|2006|p=126}} [[self-publishing]] is a common means of putting out comics, largely influenced by the success of [[Dave Sim]]'s ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark|Cerebus]]''. [[Minicomics]] {{not a typo|is}} another form that has remained popular since the 1980s, when [[Chester Brown]] and [[Julie Doucet]] got started by distributing self-published photocopied comics.  The minicomics scene has been spurred on by ''[[Broken Pencil]]'', a magazine dedicated to promoting the [[zine]]s.{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="New Directions, 1989-2001"}}

A number of [[fan convention]]s are held throughout Canada, including the [[Central Canada Comic Con]], [[Fan Expo Canada]], [[Montreal Comiccon]], [[Paradise Comics Toronto Comicon]], [[Ottawa Comiccon]], and [[Toronto Comicon]].  The [[Toronto Comic Arts Festival]] (TCAF), modeled after European festivals such as [[Angoulême International Comics Festival|Angoulême]] and the American [[Small Press Expo]], has grown since 2003, and since 2009 has enjoyed the support of the [[Toronto Public Library]].{{sfn|Braga|2011}}

===Awards===

A number of awards for Canadian comics and cartooning have appeared, especially since the beginning of the 21st Century.

The [[National Newspaper Awards]] was established in 1949&lt;ref name="CBC-NNA2009" /&gt; with a category for [[Editorial cartoonist|Editorial Cartooning]]&lt;ref name="NBArchives" /&gt; honouring those that "embody an idea made clearly apparent, good drawing, and striking pictorial effect in the public interest".  The award's first recipient was Jack Booth of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.{{sfn|Hustak|Monet|2012}}

The Bédélys Prize ({{lang-fr|Prix Bédélys}}) has been awarded to French-language comics since 2000.  It comes with [[Bursary|bursaries]] for the Prix Bédélys Québec (for Best Book from Québec) and Prix Bédélys Fanzine.&lt;ref name="ShusterBedelys" /&gt;

Since 2005 the [[Joe Shuster Award]]s have been handed out by the [[Canadian Comic Book Creator Awards Association]], named after the [[Toronto]]-born co-creator of [[Superman]].  It is open to all [[Canadians|Canadian]]s, including those living abroad, as well as [[permanent resident]]s, for comics in any language.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=page 302–303}}  Along with awards for Outstanding Cartoonist, Outstanding Writer, Outstanding Artist and others, it also features the Joe Shuster Hall of Fame, and the Harry Kremer Retailer Award, named after the founder of Canada's [[Now &amp; Then Books|oldest surviving comic shop]].&lt;ref name="CBDShuster" /&gt;

The [[Doug Wright Award]]s also began in 2005. Awards are given for Best Book, Best Emerging Talent, and since 2008 the Pigskin Peters Award for non-narrative (or nominally-narrative) comics; Pigskin Peters was a character in [[Jimmy Frise]]'s ''[[Birdseye Center]]''.&lt;ref name="CBC2008-06-03" /&gt; The Doug Wright Awards also inducts cartoonists into Giants of the North: The [[Canadian Cartoonist Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name="AOLCanada2008-08-09" /&gt;

==Academia==

From the 1990s onward an increasing amount of literature on Canadian comics has appeared, in both official languages.  Books such as ''[[Guardians of the North]]'' (1992) and ''[[Invaders from the North]]'' (2006) appeared by comics historian [[John Bell (historian)|John Bell]], who became senior archivist at [[Library and Archives Canada]] in [[Ottawa]].  American magazine ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' ran a special issue on Canadian comics in 2004.&lt;ref name="CanadianComicsReferencesInPrint" /&gt;  In French, Michel Viau wrote a book on francophone comics called ''BDQ: Répertoire des publications de bandes dessinées au Québec des origines à nos jours'' (2000).{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="New Directions, 1989-2001"}}  Bart Beaty and Jeet Heer have been writing about comics academically and professionally, and regularly have articles educating the public on comics published in newspapers such as the ''[[National Post]]'' and ''[[the Boston Globe]]'', as well as comics and literary magazines.{{sfn|Spurgeon|2007}}  Canadian [[Feminism|feminist]] scholars such as Mary Louise Adams, Mona Gleason, and Janice Dickin McGinnis have done research into the anti-[[crime comics]] campaigns of the late 1940s and 1950s, from the point of view of the [[moral panic]] and social and legal history of the era, and the sociology of sexuality.{{sfn|Bell|2002|loc="New Directions, 1989-2001"}}

'''Class Struggle''' is a board game for two to six players, designed by [[Bertell Ollman]]. It was published in 1978 by [[Avalon Hill]]. The game was intended to teach players about the politics of [[Marxism]], and was loosely compared the board game, [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1510/class-struggle|title=Class Struggle|website=BoardGameGeek|access-date=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13217762/class_struggle_game_shows_real/|title="Class Struggle" game shows real system, Marxist prof says (1978)|date=1978-05-24|work=The Eagle|access-date=2017-08-20|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13217777/of_professors_politicians_presidents/|title=Of professors, politicians, presidents (Class Struggle board game mention) (1981)|date=1981-06-07|work=The Salina Journal|access-date=2017-08-20|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game pits Workers against Capitalists, represented by hammers and top hats respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Players receive their class by a roll of the "genetic" dice.

'''Daniel Alexander Payne Murray''' (1852-1925) was an American bibliographer, author, [[politician]], and [[historian]].  He also worked as an assistant [[librarian]] at the [[Library of Congress]].

==Biography==
Murray was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], on March 3, 1852. In 1861, he went to work at the United States Senate Restaurant managed by his brother who was also a caterer.  He joined the professional staff of the [[Library of Congress]] in 1871. He was eighteen years old, and only the second black American to work for the Library. Murray became the personal assistant to the Librarian of Congress, [[Ainsworth Rand Spofford]] at the age of nineteen.

By 1881 he had risen to become assistant librarian, a position he held for forty-one years. Murray married [[educator]] [[Anna Evans Murray|Anna Jane Evans]] (1858 - 1955) on April 2, 1879, with whom he had seven children; the couple became a major force in the social and civic life of the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Jessie Carney |title=Notable Black American Women, Book 2 |publisher=VNR AG |date=1996 |isbn=9780810391772 |chapter=Anna Evans Murray (1857-1955): Kindergarten advocate, educator, clubwoman, civic leader |page=492 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ssMBzqrUpjwC&amp;pg=PA492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===African American writings===
Murray began to compile a collection of books and pamphlets authored by [[African American]]s at the request of [[Herbert Putnam]], the successor to Spofford. The collection was to be an exhibition for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris Exposition]] on "Negro Authors". In 1900 Murray published a list of the collections' holdings to date and appealed for additions to the list through donations.

Within several months, his list had grown to eleven hundred titles. The Library of Congress's "Colored Authors' Collection" originated from his efforts. Now known as the "Daniel A. P. Murray Pamphlet Collection", it contains works dating from 1821 by such authors as [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Booker T. Washington]], [[Ida B. Wells|Ida B. Wells-Barnett]], [[Benjamin W. Arnett]], and [[Alexander Crummell]]. Murray planned to expand his collection and create an encyclopedia of African-American achievement; unfortunately, the project never received sufficient support to become a reality.

===African American affairs===
Murray was widely acknowledged as an authority on African-American concerns. He was the first African-American member of the Washington Board of Trade, and he testified before the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] about [[Jim Crow law]]s and the migration of African-Americans from rural locations to urban areas. He was twice a delegate to the [[Republican National Convention]] and was a member of many other councils and organizations.

He was also a prolific author, and a frequent contributor to African American journals, in particular ''[[The Voice of the Negro]]''. He was also well known for his writings on [[African American history]], including his monumental but uncompleted ''[[Historical and Biographical Encyclopedia of the Colored Race]]''. Murray's personal library of African American works was bequeathed to the Library of Congress upon his death March 31, 1925.

'''Daniel Halévy''' (12 December 1872 – 4 February 1962) was a [[France|French]] [[historian]].

== Life ==
The son of [[Ludovic Halévy]], Daniel was born in and died in [[Paris]]. His family was of Jewish descent, but his parents were Protestant and he was brought up as a Protestant.  He studied at the [[Lycée Condorcet]], where he became friends with [[Marcel Proust]].

Social historians have acknowledged Halévy for his "Essai sur l'accélération de l'histoire" ''(Essay on the Acceleration of History)'', while he remains largely overlooked by literary scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/384696 Daniel Halévy and His Times by Alain Silvera], Robert T. Denommé, ''[[The French Review]]'', Vol. 40, No. 5 (Apr., 1967), pp. 714-716&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote a book, ''Degas parle''.... (''My Friend Degas'' in English), based on his journal notes as a teenager and man in his 20s.  The book was revised and finished when he was in his late 80s.  It was published in English in 1964.  [[Edgar Degas]] was a close friend of Ludovic and a family friend too.

With [[André Spire]], whom he had met in the ''Cooperation des Idées'', he founded the Université populaire.

Despite his early stand as a pro-[[Dreyfusard]], he later became a supporter of the political right.  Following the [[6 February 1934 crisis]], he lost all trust in parliamentary institutions. Despite his Jewish descent, he publicly declared that following 6 February 1934 he was now a "man of the extreme right". Although he personally abhorred Italian [[Fascism]] and German [[National Socialism]], he went on to support Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]]'s [[Vichy regime]].&lt;ref&gt;See, inter alia, Mark Hulliung ''Citizens and citoyens: republicans and liberals in America and France'' (2002) at p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;  The radicalisation of the right wing would accelerate after the election of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] in 1936 and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9384">The '''Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ur- und Frühgeschichte e.V. (DGUF)''' – the German Society for [[Pre-]] and [[Protohistory]] – has more than 700 members and is thus the largest German association active in the field of prehistory and the early [[historical]] period. Its members are not only [[archaeology]] professionals but also private citizens interested in the subject. Known informally by its [[acronym]], DGUF (pronounced ''dey-guf''), it is the only nationwide archaeological association that also allows individual personal membership.

==DGUF – the name and origin of the society==
The widespread student unrest in 1968 and the attendant demands for change also affected prehistory studies. Students organised the ''‘Schleswiger Kreis’'' (Schleswig Circle) in order to improve communication between the various institutes, strengthen interdisciplinary cooperation between archaeology and related fields of study and thus initiate new approaches to the subject. Their main objective was also evident in the title of the journal published by the Schleswig Circle between 1970 and 1976, ‘Information papers on research in fields related to prehistory studies’ (''Informationsblätter zu Nachbarwissenschaften der Ur- und Frühgeschichte'').

The event that led to the founding of DGUF lay elsewhere, however. In early 1969, [[Bolko von Richthofen|Bolko Freiherr von Richthofen]] called upon all the universities in the Federal Republic to revive the ''"[[Gesellschaft für Deutsche Vorgeschichte]]"'' (the Society for German Prehistory) and create a successor to [[Gustaf Kossinna]]'s ''"Mannusgesellschaft"'', which had played a leading role in the [[Nazi archaeology|nationalist and racist orientation of German prehistory research in the Nazi period]]. Startled by this announcement, the members of the Schleswig Circle immediately called a meeting to determine how they could pre-empt the use of the name by third parties. As a result, 17 students and young academics from the prehistory institutes in [[Cologne]], [[Marburg]] and [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg-im-Breisgau]] founded the ''"Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ur- und Frühgeschichte e.V. (DGUF)"'' and had the name recorded in the Register of Associations with the [[Bonn]] District Court on 27 October 1969. The [[Mannus]]gesellschaft, re-founded by Bolko von Richthofen, then switched to the name ''"Gesellschaft für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Bonn)"'': in 1994, the revived journal ''"Mannus"'' was discontinued, after just 24 issues.

==Objectives and activities==
DGUF has always seen itself as an independent association of prehistory professionals who, together with other concerned citizens, support and promote the interests of archaeology – also vis-à-vis the more established institutions and relevant political circles. On a European level, in particular, DGUF seeks to influence the formulation of Directives and legislative procedures. Ever since it was founded in 1969, DGUF has remained true to its principles of encouraging new developments in archaeology, autonomy from the established archaeological institutions and a critical approach to history – even its own.

The society considers itself a platform for the exchange of ideas and cooperation in the field of pre- and protohistory – from the protection of [[cultural landscape]]s to the discussion of the archaeological aspects of different periods, the promotion of archaeological interests among the general public and the enlightenment of the relevant political authorities. In the overall domain of German archaeology, DGUF is a leader in the presentation of the concerns of professional archaeology to the general public as well as the clarification of issues relating to university curricula and careers in archaeology.

In addition to selective cooperations with external partners, DGUF maintains longterm partnerships based on mutual agreements to reach their goals. They are members of the German umbrella organization „Deutscher Verband der Archäologie (DVA)“ and,  based on a „memorandum of understanding“, they entered into new European partnerships with the „[[European Association of Archaeologists]] (EAA)“ and the international social-professional organisation „[[Chartered Institute for Archaeologists]] (CIfA)“ in 2018.

==Structure==
The society is directed by a Board consisting of three persons who are elected on a rotational basis for two-year periods. Current president is Diane Scherzler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dguf.de/index.php?id=126|title=Diane Scherzler: Vorsitzende der DGUF|website=www.dguf.de|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are assisted by co-opted committee members with specific responsibilities. Study groups are formed to deal with special topics, e.g. on the protection of [[cultural heritage]] or the foundation of a professional association for archaeologists.

==Annual conference and awards==
One of the society's most important activities is the organisation of an annual conference, to which both members and guests are invited. The conference is always held over the three days after the [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension]] holiday: academic papers are presented on the Friday and Sunday, with an excursion to archaeological sites in the vicinity of the conference venue on the Saturday. The venue varies: 1999 [[Konstanz|Constance]], 2000 [[Dresden]], 2001 Schleswig, 2002 [[Neuruppin]], 2003 Cologne, 2004 [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], 2005 [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], 2006 [[Berlin]], 2007 [[Basel|Basle]], 2008 [[Mannheim]], 2009 [[Hamburg]], 2010 [[Aschaffenburg]], 2011 [[Erfurt]], 2012 Dresden, 2013 [[Erfurt|Erlangen]], 2014 Berlin, 2015 Tübingen, 2016 Berlin, 2017 [[Mainz]], 2018 Grünwald near Munic. The next conference will take place in Bonn, on June 20th - 23th, 2019, where the society has its 50th anniversary.

At the meetings both awards donated by the DGUF are presented: these are the Archaeology Prize (''Deutscher Archäologiepreis'') and the German Students Award for Archaeology (''Deutscher Studienpreis für Archäologie''). The Archaeology Prize is awarded to scientists and their outstanding achievements which have forwarded the communication between science and public or the development of important methods. The study prize is awarded to students for outstanding scientific achievements or commitment in university policy.

==Publications==
In 1972, the first issue of DGUF's own journal, ''"Archäologische Informationen"'', appeared:  particular features are its positive attitude towards interdisciplinary topics and the ''"Forum"'' section, in which controversial subjects are discussed in a dialogue between articles presenting the different points of view. Since 2013 the journal is published in „Platinum Open Access“, all other volumes before that year which have been published only in print, in the meantime have been retro-digitized and are freely accessible. In August 2016, the DGUF signed the [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]].

Since 1987, DGUF has also published a series of archaeological research reports, the ''"Archäologische Berichte"''. Since volume 24 new issues are published as Open Access, while older issues are retro-digitized and given to free access step by step.

In 2017 DGUF has founded a new series of archaeological reports called "Archäologische Quellen", which is also available in Open Access.

Since 1997, the society has maintained an internet site. Since 2012 the society publishes a monthly newsletter, which is free of charge, and has accounts on Facebook and Twitter in order to promote its activities.

The '''Discordian''' or '''Erisian calendar''' is an alternative [[calendar]] used by some adherents of [[Discordianism]]. It is specified on page 00034 of the ''[[Principia Discordia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malaclypse the Younger]], [http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/41.php ''Principia Discordia''], Page 00034&lt;/ref&gt;

The Discordian year 1 YOLD is 1166 BC. (Elsewhere in the ''Principia Discordia'', it is mentioned that the Curse of Greyface occurred in 1166 BC, so this is presumably related to the start-date of the calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Malaclypse the Younger, [http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/49.php ''Principia Discordia''], Page 00042&lt;/ref&gt;) As a reference, AD {{CURRENTYEAR}} is {{Dis-year}} YOLD (Year of Our Lady of Discord). The abbreviation "YOLD" is not used in the Principia, though the phrase "Year of Our Lady of Discord" is mentioned once.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malaclypse the Younger]], [http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/60.php ''Principia Discordia''], Page 00053&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
As described in the ''Principia Discordia'', the Discordian calendar has five 73-day seasons: [[wiktionary:chaos|Chaos]], [[wiktionary:discord|Discord]], [[wiktionary:confusion|Confusion]], [[Bureaucracy]], and [[wiktionary:aftermath|The Aftermath]]. The Discordian year is aligned with the Gregorian calendar and begins on January 1, thus Chaos 1, {{Dis-year}} YOLD is January 1, [[{{CURRENTYEAR}}]] Gregorian.

The Erisian week consists of five days: Sweetmorn, Boomtime, Pungenday, Prickle-Prickle, and Setting Orange. The days of the week are named after the five basic Discordian elements: Sweet, Boom, Pungent, Prickle, and Orange. There are 73 of these weeks per year and every year begins with Sweetmorn.

Every fourth year in the Discordian calendar, starting in 2 YOLD, an extra day is inserted between Chaos 59 and Chaos 60 called '''St. Tib's Day'''. This is because 4 years + 1 day = 5, a holy number, but the Discordian [[leap year]] also coincides with the Gregorian one. The result of this is that any given day of the year in the Discordian calendar may be taken to correspond to the same day of the year in the [[Gregorian calendar]], and vice versa, although some users of the calendar believe that it is tied to the [[Julian calendar]] and so will diverge from the Gregorian in 3266 YOLD (AD 2100). St. Tib's day is considered outside the Discordian week.

There are Apostle Holydays on the 5th day of each season, named after the 5 Discordian apostles: Mungday, for [[Hung Mung]]; Mojoday, for Dr Van Van Mojo; Syaday, for Sri Syadasti; Zaraday, for Zarathud; and Maladay, for Malaclypse the Elder. There are also Season Holydays on the 50th of each season: Chaoflux, Discoflux, Confuflux, Bureflux, and Afflux.

Only these eleven dates are named in the ''Principia Discordia''; however, Discordians have felt free to invent other holidays which have become popular to varying degrees. Some of these include Discordians for Jesus/Love Your Neighbor Day ([[March 25]]/Discord 11); Jake Day ([[April 6]]/Discord 23 or occasionally [[May 23]]/Discord 70), a day to send tongue-in-cheek letters, emails or faxes to an official or bureaucracy; Saint [[Harold Camping|Camping]]'s Day ([[May 21]]/Discord 68), a day to make End of Days predictions and share them in social media; [[Towel Day]] ([[May 25]]/Discord 72); Mid Year's Day ([[July 2]]/ Confusion 37); [[X-Day (Church of the SubGenius)|X-Day]] ([[July 5]]/Confusion 40); and [[Undergarments|Multiversal Underwear Day]] ([[August 10]]/Bureaucracy 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Implementations==
'''Ddate''',  is a program that prints the current date in the Discordian calendar.  It was a part of the [[util-linux]] package containing basic system utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/util-linux-2.12j.lsm |title=util-linux: Miscellaneous utilities for Linux, 2.12j |accessdate=2007-12-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213155009/http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/util-linux-2.12j.lsm |archivedate=February 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it had been included at least since 1994 in nearly all [[Linux distribution]]s.  In August 2011 however, one of the maintainers of util-linux made ddate optional, and by default omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=build-sys: add --enable-ddate
| url=https://git.kernel.org/?p=utils/util-linux/util-linux.git;a=commit;h=4a8962f3a7cb970b28add7d770528edebbe03635
| work=[[kernel.org]] [[Git (software)|Git]] commit log
| publisher=Karel Zak
| accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2012, ddate was completely removed from util-linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=ddate: remove from util-linux
| url=https://git.kernel.org/cgit/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git/commit/?id=4cf02b65109029a38f708148dea8d2bdf2fa19de
| work=[[kernel.org]] [[Git (software)|Git]] commit log
| publisher=Karel Zak
| accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ddate program now has an upstream source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=The ddate source ripped out of util-linux
| url=https://github.com/bo0ts/ddate
| work=[[GitHub]]/bo0ts/ddate
| publisher=Philipp Moeller (bo0ts)
| accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was some controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| work=[[Linux Weekly News]]
| accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the end, anyone wishing to reintroduce ddate to a distribution will have to create a separate package based on the new upstream. This has been done for [[Debian]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Fedora Linux]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Fedora ddate Package page

| work=Fedora Packages Web App

There are many other programs with similar functionality, such as HodgePodge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Elaine Elizabeth Shepard''' (April 2, 1913 – September 6, 1998) was a Broadway and film actress in the 1930s and 1940s. She was also the author of ''The Doom Pussy'', a semi-fictional account of aviation in the [[Vietnam War]].

==Film and stage==
Shepard's first film appearance was in the 1936 [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] [[Serial (film)|serial]] ''[[Darkest Africa]]'', in which she played Valerie Tremaine, the heroine of the film.&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0791616/|title=Elaine Sheppard|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed with a series of leading roles in other minor films, such as ''[[You Can't Fool Your Wife]]'', a 1940 comedy starring [[Lucille Ball]].&lt;ref name="IMDB"/&gt; She then had several minor roles in major films, including playing a secretary in ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'' and uncredited roles in ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' and the 1946 ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]''.&lt;ref name="IMDB"/&gt; A more prominent role came in ''[[Seven Days Ashore]]'', a musical in which she plays the principal love interest for the band of sailors on shore leave.&lt;ref name="CFG.ashore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfilmguide.com/index.php?s=pageA&amp;item=167 |title=Seven Days Ashore |publisher=Classic Film Guide |accessdate=2009-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028152607/http://www.classicfilmguide.com/index.php?s=pageA&amp;item=167 |archivedate=October 28, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepard also had some minor appearances on Broadway, including a part in the 1940 [[Cole Porter]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Panama Hattie]]''.&lt;ref name="IBDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=99992|title=Elaine Shepard|publisher=Internet Broadway Database|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freelance journalism==
Shepard abandoned acting and turned to freelance journalism. She is best known in this role for her [[Vietnam War]] coverage, which became the basis for her 1967 book ''The Doom Pussy'', recounting her experiences with aviators in the early part of the war.&lt;ref&gt;See for example in {{cite book|title=Vietnam Voices: Perspectives on the War Years, 1941-1975|

'''Elizabeth Ann Hawley''' (November 9, 1923 – January 26, 2018)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/-sherlock-holmes--of-nepal-s-himalayas-dies-at-94-9899052]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[journalist]] and chronicler of [[Himalaya]]n expeditions. She travelled to [[Nepal]] in February 1959 and never left.

Hawley was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. She was educated at the [[University of Michigan]]. She moved to Nepal after giving up her job as a researcher for ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine in New York and visiting [[Kathmandu]] on a round-the-world trip. Working briefly as a reporter, Hawley went back to San Francisco, returning to Nepal a few years later as journalist for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]].''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiaspecific/-sherlock-holmes-of-nepal-s-himalayas-dies-at-94-9899052 Elizabeth Hawley dies at 94]&lt;/ref&gt;

She found work with the [[Reuters]] news agency covering mountaineering news, including the 1963 American expedition that was the first from the United States to traverse [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jolly |first=Joanna |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10268549 |title=Elizabeth Hawley, unrivalled Himalayan record keeper|publisher=BBC News |date=28 August 2010 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her activities won her the nickname "The Sherlock Holmes of the Mountaineering World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO9SzrhIxGo|title=Elizabeth Hawley, Who Chronicled Everest Treks, Dies at 94|publisher=New York Times|date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While she never climbed a mountain herself, Hawley was the best-known chronicler of Himalayan expeditions for over four decades, and was respected by the international mountaineering community because of her complete and accurate records, despite their unofficial status. Her records are summarized in a database&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Joseph Ernest Renan''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁənɑ̃|lang}}; 28 February 1823&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;2 October 1892)&lt;ref&gt;{{wsPSM|Notes &amp; Obituary Notes|42|December 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French expert of [[Semitic languages]] and civilizations ([[philology]]), [[philosopher]], [[historian]], and writer, devoted to his native province of [[Brittany]]. He is best known for his influential historical works on [[early Christianity]], and his [[political theory|political]] theories, especially concerning [[nationalism]] and [[national identity]]. Renan is credited as being among the first scholars to advance the [[Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry|Khazar theory]], which held that [[Ashkenazi Jews]] were descendants of the [[Khazars]], Turkic peoples who had adopted Jewish religion and migrated to Western Europe following the collapse of their [[khanate]].

==Life==

===Birth and family===
[[File:Maison Musée Ernest Renan Tréguier.jpg|thumb|Ernest Renan birthplace museum in [[Tréguier]]]]
He was born at [[Tréguier]] in Brittany to a family of fishermen.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Alfred (1924). "Renan: The Man," ''The Catholic Historical Review'', Vol. 10, No. 3, pp. 388-398.&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, having made a small fortune with his fishing-shack, bought a house at Tréguier and settled there, and his father, captain of a small cutter and an ardent [[republicanism|republican]], married the daughter of a Royalist tradesman from the neighbouring town of [[Lannion]]. All his life, Renan was aware of the conflict between his father's and his mother's political beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} He was five years old when his father died, and his sister, Henriette, twelve years his senior, became the moral head of the household. Having in vain attempted to keep a school for girls at Tréguier, she departed and went to [[Paris, France|Paris]] as a teacher in a young ladies' boarding-school.

===Education===
Ernest, meanwhile, was educated in the ecclesiastical seminary of his native town.&lt;ref&gt;Loth, Joseph (1892). "Renan au Collège de Tréguier," ''Annales de Bretagne'' '''8''' (1), pp. 124-9.&lt;/ref&gt; His school reports describe him as "docile, patient, diligent, painstaking, thorough". While the priests taught him mathematics and Latin, his mother completed his education. Renan's mother was half [[Breton people|Breton]]. Her paternal ancestors came from [[Bordeaux]], and Renan used to say that in his own nature the [[Gascony|Gascon]] and the Breton were constantly at odds.&lt;ref&gt;[[René Galand|Galand, René]] (1959). ''L'Âme Celtique de Renan''. Presses Universitaires de France.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1838, Renan won all the prizes at the college of Tréguier. His sister told the doctor of the school in Paris where she taught about her brother, and he informed [[Félix Dupanloup|F.A.P. Dupanloup]], who was involved in organizing the ecclesiastical college of St [[Nicholas du Chardonnet]], a school in which the young Catholic nobility and the most talented pupils of the Catholic seminaries were to be educated together, with the idea of creating friendships between the aristocracy and the priesthood. Dupanloup sent for Renan, who was only fifteen years old and had never been outside [[Brittany]]. "I learned with stupor that knowledge was not a privilege of the church ... I awoke to the meaning of the words talent, fame, celebrity." Religion seemed to him wholly different in Tréguier and in Paris. The superficial, brilliant, pseudo-scientific Catholicism of the capital did not satisfy Renan, who had accepted the austere faith of his Breton masters.

===Study at Issy-les Moulineaux===
In 1840, Renan left St Nicholas to study philosophy at the seminary of [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]]. He entered with a passion for Catholic [[scholasticism]]. The rhetoric of St Nicholas had wearied him, and his serious intelligence hoped to satisfy itself with the vast and solid material of Catholic [[theology]]. [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche]] first attracted him among the philosophers, and, after these, he turned to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|J. G. Herder]]. Renan began to see an essential contradiction between the [[metaphysics]] which he studied and the faith he professed, but an appetite for truths that can be verified restrained his scepticism. "Philosophy excites and only half satisfies the appetite for truth; I am eager for mathematics", he wrote to Henriette. Henriette had accepted in the family of Count [[Zamoyski]] an engagement more lucrative than her former job. She exercised the strongest influence over her brother.

===Study at college of St Sulpice===
It was not mathematics but [[philology]] which was to settle Renan's gathering doubts. His course completed at Issy, he entered the college of St Sulpice in order to take his degree in philology prior to entering the church, and, here, he began the study of Hebrew.  He realized that the second part of the ''[[Book of Isaiah]]'' differs from the first not only in style but in date, that the grammar and the history of the ''[[Pentateuch]]'' are later than the time of [[Moses]], and that the ''[[Book of Daniel]]'' is clearly written centuries after the time in which it is set. Secretly, Renan felt himself denied the [[communion of saints]], yet desired to live the life of a Catholic priest. The struggle between vocation and conviction was won by conviction. In October 1845, Renan left St Sulpice for Stanislas, a lay college of the [[Oratory (worship)|Oratorians]]. Still feeling too much under the domination of the church, he reluctantly ended the last of his associations with religious life and entered M. Crouzet's school for boys as a teacher.

===Scholarly career===
[[File:Joseph Ernest Renan, by F. Mulnier.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Joseph Ernest Renan, by F. Mulnier]]
Renan, educated by priests, was to accept the scientific ideal with an extraordinary expansion of all his faculties. He became ravished by the splendor of the cosmos. At the end of his life, he wrote of [[Henri-Frédéric Amiel|Amiel]], "The man who has time to keep a private diary has never understood the immensity of the universe." The certitudes of physical and natural science were revealed to Renan in 1846 by the chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]], then a boy of eighteen, his pupil at M. Crouzet's school. To the day of Renan's death, their friendship continued. Renan was occupied as usher only during evenings. During the daytime, he continued his researches in [[Semitic languages|Semitic philology]]. In 1847, he obtained the [[Volney prize]], one of the principal distinctions awarded by the [[Academy of Inscriptions]], for the manuscript of his "General History of Semitic Languages." In 1847, he took his degree as ''Agrégé de Philosophie'' – that is to say, fellow of the university – and was offered a job as master in the ''lycée'' [[Vendôme]].

In 1856, Ernest Renan married in Paris Cornélie Scheffer, daughter of [[Hendrik Scheffer]] and niece of [[Ary Scheffer]], both French painters of Dutch descent. They had two children, [[Ary Renan]], born in 1858, who became a painter, and Noémi, born in 1862, who eventually married [[Yannis Psycharis]].

====''Life of Jesus''====
Within his lifetime, Renan was best known as the author of the enormously popular ''Life of Jesus'' (''Vie de Jésus'', 1863).&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Terence R. (1994). "The Letter and the Spirit: Deconstructing Renan's "Life of Jesus" and the Assumptions of Modernity," ''Religion &amp; Literature'', Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 55-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pitt, Alan (2000). "The Cultural Impact of Science in France: Ernest Renan and the Vie de Jésus," ''The Historical Journal'', Vol. 43, No. 1, pp. 79-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Renan attributed the idea of the book to his sister, Henriette, with whom he was traveling in [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman Syria and Palestine]] when, struck with a fever, she died suddenly.  With only a [[New Testament]] and copy of [[Josephus]] as references, he began writing.&lt;ref&gt;Hammerton, J.A. (1937). ''Outline of Great Books'', New York: Wise &amp; Co., p. 998.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was first translated into English in the year of its publication by [[Charles E. Wilbour]] and has remained in print for the past 145 years.&lt;ref&gt;As of this writing, [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24540192/editions?editionsView=true&amp;start_edition=1&amp;se=yr&amp;sd=asc&amp;qt=sort_yr_asc WorldCat reports 115 different editions] of the book [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24540192&amp;referer=brief_results in 1426 different libraries].&lt;/ref&gt; Renan's ''Life of Jesus'' was lavished with ironic praise and criticism by [[Albert Schweitzer]] in his book ''[[The Quest of the Historical Jesus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, William (1992). ''History of New Testament Research: From Deism to Tubingen''. Augsburg: Fortress Press, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renan claimed Jesus was able to purify himself of [[Jewish traits]] and that Jesus became an [[Aryan]], his ''Life of Jesus'' promoted racial ideas and infused race into theology and the person of Jesus, he depicted Jesus as a [[Galilea]]n who was transformed from a Jew into a Christian, and that Christianity emerged purified of any Jewish influences.&lt;ref name="Heschel2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susannah Heschel|title=The Aryan Jesus: christian theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiCJeNJIhoAC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=31 May 2013|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12531-2|page=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was based largely on the Gospel of John, and was a scholarly work.&lt;ref name="Heschel2008"/&gt;  It depicted Jesus as a man but not God, and rejected the miracles of the Gospel.&lt;ref name="Heschel2008"/&gt; Renan believed by humanizing Jesus he was restoring to him a greater dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Chadbourne, Richard M. (1968). ''Ernest Renan''. New York: Twayne Publishers, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's controversial assertions that the [[life of Jesus]] should be written like the life of any historic person, and that the Bible could and should be subject to the same critical scrutiny as other historical documents caused some controversy&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dublinreview27unkngoog#page/n396/mode/2up "Renan's 'Vie de Jesus',"] ''The Dublin Review'' '''2''', January/April 1864, pp. 386-419.&lt;/ref&gt; and enraged many Christians,&lt;ref&gt;Jules Théodose Loyson ''[https://archive.org/details/uneprtenduevied00loysgoog Une prétendue Vie de Jésus, ou M. Ernest Renan, historien, philosophe et poëte]'' (Paris, Douniol, 1863)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cochin, Augustin (1863). ''[https://archive.org/details/quelquesmotssur00cochgoog Quelques mots sur la Vie de Jésus de M. Ernest Renan]''. Paris: Douniol.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archive.org/details/instructionpast00plangoog Instruction pastorale de Monseigneur l'évêque de Nîmes au clergé de son diocèse contre un ouvrage intitulé "Vie de Jésus" par Ernest Renan]'' (1863)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Several of the books of [[Henri-Joseph Crelier]] have polemical titles naming Renan.&lt;/ref&gt; and many Jews were enraged because of its depiction of Judaism as foolish and absurdly illogical and for insisting that Jesus and Christianity was superior.&lt;ref name="Heschel2008"/&gt;

===Continuation of scholarly career: social views===
Renan was not only a scholar. In his book on [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], as in the [[Apostles]], he shows his concern with the larger social life, his sense of fraternity, and a revival of the democratic sentiment which had inspired ''L'Avenir de la Science''. In 1869, he presented himself as the candidate of the liberal opposition at the parliamentary election for [[Meaux]]. While his temper had become less aristocratic, his liberalism had grown more tolerant. On the eve of its dissolution, Renan was half prepared to accept the Empire, and, had he been elected to the Chamber of Deputies, he would have joined the group of ''l'Empire liberal'', but he was not elected. A year later, war was declared with Germany; the Empire was abolished, and [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] became an exile. The [[Franco-Prussian War]] was a turning-point in Renan's history. Germany had always been to him the asylum of thought and disinterested science. Now, he saw the land of his ideal destroy and ruin the land of his birth; he beheld the German no longer as a priest, but as an invader.
[[File:ErnestRenan.jpg|thumb|left|Ernest Renan in his study by [[Anders Zorn]]]]

In ''La Réforme Intellectuelle et Morale'' (1871), Renan tried to safeguard France's future. Yet, he was still influenced by Germany. The ideal and the discipline which he proposed to his defeated country were those of her conqueror—a feudal society, a monarchical government, an elite which the rest of the nation exists merely to support and nourish; an ideal of honor and duty imposed by a chosen few on the recalcitrant and subject multitude. The errors attributed to the ''Commune'' confirmed Renan in this reaction. At the same time, the irony always perceptible in his work grows more bitter. His ''Dialogues Philosophiques'', written in 1871, his ''[[Ecclesiastes]]'' (1882) and his ''Antichrist'' (1876) (the fourth volume of the ''Origins of Christianity'', dealing with the reign of [[Nero]]) are incomparable in their literary genius{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}, but they are examples of a disenchanted and sceptical temper. He had vainly tried to make his country obey his precepts. The progress of events showed him, on the contrary, a France which, every day, left a little stronger, and he roused himself from his disbelieving, disillusioned mood and observed with interest the struggle for justice and liberty of a democratic society. The fifth and sixth volumes of the ''Origins of Christianity'' (the Christian Church and [[Marcus Aurelius]]) show him reconciled with democracy, confident in the gradual ascent of man, aware that the greatest catastrophes do not really interrupt the sure if imperceptible progress of the world and reconciled, also, if not with the truths, at least with the moral beauties of Catholicism and with the remembrance of his pious youth.

====Definition of nationhood====
Renan's definition of a [[nation-state|nation]] has been extremely influential. This was given in his 1882 discourse ''[[What is a Nation?|Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]'' ("What is a Nation?"). Whereas German writers like [[Fichte]] had defined the nation by [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] criteria such as a [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or an [[ethnic group]] "sharing common characteristics" (language, etc.), Renan defined it by the desire of a people to live together, which he summarized by a famous phrase, "avoir fait de grandes choses ensemble, vouloir en faire encore" (having done great things together and wishing to do more). Writing in the midst of the dispute concerning the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region, he declared that the existence of a nation was based on a "daily [[plebiscite]]." Some authors criticize that definition, based on a "daily plebiscite", because of the ambiguity of the concept. They argue that this definition is an idealization and it should be interpreted within the German tradition and not in opposition to it. They say that the arguments used by Renan at the conference '' What is a Nation? '' are not consistent with his thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]] ''. Historia, arraza, nazioa ''. Donostia: Elkar, 2014. {{ISBN|978-84-9027-297-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Deutsch]] (in "Nationalism and its alternatives") suggested that a nation is "a group of people united by a mistaken view about the past and a hatred of their neighbors." This phrase is frequently, but mistakenly, attributed to Renan himself. He did indeed write that if "the essential element of a nation is that all its individuals must have many things in common", they "must also have forgotten many things. Every French citizen must have forgotten the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|night of St. Bartholomew]] and the [[Albigensian Crusade|massacres in the 13th century in the South]]." Renan's work has especially influenced 20th century theorist of nationalism, [[Benedict Anderson]].

===Late scholarly career===
[[File:Renan in his Study in the College of France.jpg|thumb|Renan in his study in the College of France]]
[[File:Caricature of Ernest Renan, Vanity Fair.jpg|right|thumb|Renan caricatured by GUTH in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1910]]
Shifting away from his pessimism regarding liberalism's prospects during the 1870s while still believing in the necessity of an intellectual elite to influence democratic society for the good, Renan rallied to support the [[French Third Republic]], humorously describing himself as a ''légitimiste'', that is, a person who needs "about ten years to accustom myself to regarding any government as legitimate," and adding "I, who am not a republican ''a priori'', who am a simple Liberal quite willing to adjust myself to a constitutional monarchy, would be more loyal to the Republic than newly converted republicans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=David C. J. |title=Ernest Renan |date=1996 |publisher=Ardent Media |pages=97-99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The progress of the sciences under the Republic and the latitude given to the freedom of thought that Renan cherished above all had allayed many of his previous fears, and he opposed the deterministic and fatalist theories of philosophers like [[Hippolyte Taine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=David C. J. |title=Ernest Renan |date=1996 |publisher=Ardent Media |pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Noronha-DiVanna |first1=Isabel |title=Writing History in the Third Republic |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he got older, the philosopher contemplated his childhood. He was nearly sixty when, in 1883, he published the autobiographical ''Souvenirs d'Enfance et de Jeunesse'', the work by which he is now best known in France.

They showed the blasé modern reader that a world no less poetic, no less primitive than that of the ''Origins of Christianity'' exists or still existed within living memory on the northwestern coast of France. They have the [[Celt]]ic magic of ancient romance and the simplicity, the naturalness, and the veracity which the 19th century prized so highly. But his ''Ecclesiastes'', published a few months earlier, his ''Drames Philosophiques'', collected in 1888, give a more adequate image of his fastidious critical, disenchanted, yet optimistic spirit. They show the attitude towards uncultured Socialism of a philosopher liberal by conviction, by temperament an aristocrat. We learn in them how [[Caliban (character)|Caliban]] (democracy), the mindless brute, educated to his own responsibility, makes after all an adequate ruler; how [[Prospero]] (the aristocratic principle, or, if we will, the mind) accepts his dethronement for the sake of greater liberty in the intellectual world, since Caliban proves an effective policeman and leaves his superiors a free hand in the laboratory; how [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]] (the religious principle) acquires a firmer hold on life and no longer gives up the ghost at the faintest hint of change. Indeed, Ariel flourishes in the service of Prospero under the external government of the many-headed brute. Religion and knowledge are as imperishable as the world they dignify. Thus, out of the depths rises unvanquished the essential [[idealism]] of Renan.

Renan was a great worker. At sixty years of age, having finished the ''Origins of Christianity'', he began his ''History of [[Israel]]'', based on a lifelong study of the ''[[Old Testament]]'' and on the ''Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum'', published by the [[Académie des Inscriptions]] under Renan's direction from the year 1881 till the end of his life. The first volume of the ''History of Israel'' appeared in 1887; the third, in 1891; the last two posthumously. As a history of facts and theories, the book has many faults; as an essay on the evolution of the religious idea, it is (despite some passages of frivolity, irony, or incoherence) of extraordinary importance{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}; as a reflection of the mind of Renan, it is the most lifelike of images. In a volume of collected essays, ''Feuilles Détachées'', published also in 1891, we find the same mental attitude, an affirmation of the necessity of [[piety]] independent of [[dogma]]. During his last years, he received many honors, and was made an administrator of the [[Collège de France]] and grand officer of the [[Legion of Honor]]. Two volumes of the ''History of Israel'', his correspondence with his sister Henriette, his ''Letters to M. Berthelot'', and the ''History of the Religious Policy of [[Philip IV of France|Philippe-le-Bel]]'', which he wrote in the years immediately before his marriage, all appeared during the last eight years of the 19th century.

Renan died after a few days' illness in 1892 in Paris, and was buried in the [[Cimetière de Montmartre]] in the [[Montmartre Quarter]].

==Reputation and controversies==
Hugely influential in his lifetime, Renan was eulogised after his death as the embodiment of the progressive spirit in western culture. [[Anatole France]] wrote that Renan was the incarnation of modernity. Renan's works were read and appreciated by many of the leading literary figures of the time, including [[James Joyce]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Edith Wharton]], and [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Singley |first1=Carol J. |title=Race, culture, nation: Edith Wharton and Ernest Renan |journal=Twentieth Century Literature |date=2003 |volume=49 |issue=1 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Richard |title=James Joyce and Sexuality |date=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his greatest admirers was [[Manuel González Prada]] in [[Peru]] who took the ''Life of Jesus'' as a basis for his anticlericalism. In his 1932 document "[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]", Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] also applauded perceived "prefascist intuitions" in a section of Renan's "Meditations" that argued against democracy and individual rights as "[[Chimera (mythology)|chimerical]]" and intrinsically opposed to "nature's plans".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm The Doctrine of Fascism by Benito Mussolini] Complete text of the essay "''Dottrina''" (Doctrines).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statue===
[[File:Renan12.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of Ernest Renan in Tréguier town square]]
In 1903 a major controversy accompanied the installation of a monument in Tréguier designed by [[Jean Boucher (artist)|Jean Boucher]]. Placed in the local cathedral square, it was interpreted as a challenge to Catholicism, and led to widespread protests, especially because the site was normally used for the temporary pulpit erected at the traditional Catholic festival of the [[Pardon (ceremony)|Pardon of St Yves]]. It also included the Greek goddess [[Athena]] raising her arm to crown Renan gesturing in apparent challenge towards the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeanboucher.net/?d=monuments&amp;p=ernest_renan Ernest Renan à Tréguier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue, ''Ernest Renan (1823–1892) un Celte en Orient'', Musée d’Art et d’histoire, Musée de Bretagne, 1992, Ville de Saint-Brieuc, Ville de Rennes.&lt;/ref&gt; The local clergy organised a protest [[Calvary (sculpture)|Calvary sculpture]] designed by [[Yves Hernot]] as "a symbol of the triumphant [[ultramontane|ultramontaine]] church."

===Views on race===
Renan believed that racial characteristics were instinctual and [[deterministic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Olender|Olender, Maurice]] (1992).

''Aryan Idols: Indo-European Mythology as Ideology and Science''. University of Chicago Press, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Renan claimed that the Semitic mind was limited by dogmatism and lacked a cosmopolitan conception of civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;"The Racial Motif in Renan's Attitude to Jews and Judaism", in: S. Almog (ed.), ''Antisemitism Through the Ages'', Oxford, 1988, pp. 255–278.&lt;/ref&gt; For Renan, Semites were "an incomplete race."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A#4621 Anti-Semitism, by Gotthard Deutsch, ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors argue that Renan developed his antisemitism from [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] anti-Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joxe Azurmendi|Azurmendi, Joxe]] (2014). ''Historia, arraza, nazioa''. Donostia: Elkar. pp.177-86. {{ISBN|978-84-9027-297-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he did not regard the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] of Europe as being a Semitic people; Renan is credited with launching the so-called [[Khazar theory]]. This theory states that Ashkenazim had their origin in Turkic refugees that had converted to Judaism and later migrated from the collapsed [[Khazar Khanate]] westward into the [[Rhineland]], and exchanged their native [[Khazar language]] for the [[Yiddish language]] while continuing to practice the Jewish religion. In his 1883 lecture "Le Judaïsme comme race et comme Religion" he disputed the concept that [[Jewish people]] constitute a unified racial entity in a ''biological'' sense,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lejudasmecommer00renagoog#page/n9/mode/2up ''Le Judaïsme comme Race et comme Religion: Conférence faite au Cercle Saint-Simon'']. Paris: Calmann Lévy, 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; which made his views unpalatable within [[racial antisemitism]]. Renan was also known for being a strong critic of [[German nationalism|German ethnic nationalism]], with its antisemitic undertones.&lt;ref&gt;Mian, Aristide (1945-46). "Renan on War and Peace," ''The American Scholar'', Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 90-96.&lt;/ref&gt; His notions of race and ethnicity were completely at odds with the European antisemitism of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Renan wrote the following about the long history of [[persecution of Jews]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When all nations and all ages have persecuted you, there must be some motive behind it all. The Jew, up to our own time, insinuated himself everywhere, claiming the protection of the common law; but, in reality, remaining outside the common law. He retained his own status; he wished to have the same guarantees as everyone else, and, over and above that, his own exceptions and special laws. He desired the advantages of the nations without being a nation, without helping to bear the burdens of the nations. No people has ever been able to tolerate this. The nations are military creations founded and maintained by the sword; they are the work of peasants and soldiers; towards establishing them the Jews have contributed nothing. Herein is the great fallacy inspired in Israelite pretensions. The tolerated alien can be useful to a country, but only on condition that the country does not allow itself to be invaded by him. It is not fair to claim family rights in a house which one has not built, like those birds which come and take up their quarters in a nest which does not belong to them, or like the crustaceans which steal the shell of another species.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/renansantichrist00renaiala#page/n3/mode/2up ''Antichrist'']. London: Walter Scott, Ltd., 1900, pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, during the 1880s, Renan shifted away from these views. In a lecture on "Judaism as a Race and as a Religion", he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When, in 1791, the National Assembly decreed the emancipation of the Jews, it concerned itself very little with race. It considered that men ought to be judged, not by the blood that runs in their veins, but by their moral and intellectual value. It is the glory of France to take these questions by their human side. The work of the nineteenth century is to tear down every ghetto, and I have no praise for those who seek to rebuild them. The Israelite race has in the past rendered the greatest services to the world. Blended with the different nations, in harmony with the diverse national unities of Europe, it will continue to do in the future what it has done in the past. By its collaboration with all the liberal forces of Europe, it will contribute eminently to the social progress of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Paul Lawrence |title=Renan versus Gobineau: Semitism and Antisemitism, Ancient Races and Modern Liberal Nations |journal=History of European Ideas |date=2013 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=528-540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gidley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gidley |first1=Ben |title=On the Nation and the 'Jewish People' |journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies |date=2011 |volume=35 |issue=4 |page=782-783 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01419870.2011.643817?journalCode=rers20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in 1883, in a lecture called "The Original Identity and Gradual Separation of Judaism and Christianity":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Judaism, which has served so well in the past, will still serve in the future. It will serve the true cause of liberalism, of the modern spirit. Every Jew is a liberal ... The enemies of Judaism, however, if you only look at them more closely, you will see that they are the enemies of the modern spirit in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trawny |first1=Peter |title=Heidegger, “World Judaism,” and Modernity |journal=Gatherings: The Heidegger Circle Annual |date=2015 |volume=5 |page=1-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graetz |first1=Michael |title=The Jews in Nineteenth-century France: From the French Revolution to the Alliance Israélite Universelle |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other comments on race, have also proven controversial, especially his belief that political policy should take into account supposed racial differences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nature has made a race of workers, the Chinese race, who have wonderful manual dexterity and almost no sense of honor... A race of tillers of the soil, the Negro; treat him with kindness and humanity, and all will be as it should; a race of masters and soldiers, the European race. Reduce this noble race to working in the [[ergastula|ergastulum]] like Negroes and Chinese, and they rebel... But the life at which our workers rebel would make a Chinese or a [[fellaheen|fellah]] happy, as they are not military creatures in the least. Let each one do what he is made for, and all will be well.&lt;ref&gt;From Ernest Renan, "La Reforme Intellectuelle et Morale". Paris: Calmann-Levy, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This passage, among others, was cited by [[Aimé Césaire]] in his ''Discourse on Colonialism'', as evidence of the alleged hypocrisy of Western humanism and its "sordidly racist" conception of the rights of man.&lt;ref&gt;Césaire, Aimé (2000). ''[[Discourse on Colonialism]]'', Joan Pinkham, trans. New York: Monthly Review Press, pp. 37–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[Shlomo Sand]] has argued for a more complex assessment of Renan's legacy, pointing out that the anti-essentialist arguments found in Renan's later writings and lectures provided tools with which to combat and deconstruct the racialist ideas he had advocated earlier.&lt;ref name="Gidley" /&gt;

===Republican racism===
During the arising of racism theories around Europe and specifically in France—[[French Republic (1870–1940)]]—Renan had an important influence on the matter. He was a defender of people's self-determination concept,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/poetryofcelticra00renauoft#page/60/mode/2up "What is a Nation?"] In: ''The Poetry of the Celtic Races, and Other Essays''. London: The Walter Scott Publishing Co., 1896, pp. 61-83.&lt;/ref&gt; but on the other hand was in fact convinced of a "racial hierarchy of peoples" that he said was "established".&lt;ref&gt;Preface to [https://archive.org/stream/futureofsciencei00rena#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Future of Science'']. London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; Discursively, he subordinated the principle of self-determination of peoples to a racial hierarchy,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/futureofsciencei00rena#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Future of Science'']. London: Chapman &amp; Hall, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. he supported the colonialist expansion and the racist view of the Third Republic because he believed the French to be hierarchically superior (in a racial matter) to the African nations.&lt;ref&gt;Manceron, Gilles (2005). ''Marianne et les Colonies: Une Introduction à l'Histoire Coloniale de la France''. Editions La Découverte.&lt;/ref&gt; This subtle racism, called by [[:fr:Gilles Manceron|Gilles Manceron]] "Republican racism"&lt;ref&gt;Manceron (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; was common in France during the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], and was also a well-known defensing discourse in politics. Supporters of colonialism used the concept of cultural superiority, and described themselves as "protectors of civilization" to justify their colonial actions and territorial expansion.

'''Francis Lodwick''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (or '''Lodowick'''; 1619&amp;ndash;1694) was a pioneer of [[a priori language|''a priori'' languages]] (what in the seventeenth century was called a '[[philosophical language]]').

Francis Lodwick was a merchant of Flemish origin who lived in [[London]]. His name appears in ''A Collection of the Names of the Merchants living in and about the City of London'' (1677), with the address "Fan-church street". He did not have any higher education, and was admitted as a Fellow to the [[Royal Society]] at the age of 60.

[[John Aubrey]] (1626–1697) reported that there was a group of men taking up the task of constructing a philosophical language left unfinished by [[John Wilkins]] (d. 1672).  This group included Lodwick, besides Andrew Paschall (c. 1630–c. 1696), Thomas Pigott, [[Robert Hooke]] and [[John Ray]], the latter being former members of Wilkin's original committee.
Lodwick had been working on a universal alphabet for some time, and Wilkins had borrowed some of Lodwick's papers for his 1668 ''Essay''. Hooke notes in his diary for 12 November 1673 that Lodwick had lent him a revised version of his universal alphabet. For 10 July 1675, Hooke notes that Lodwick had discussed the universal character with him, and on 28 that he (Hooke) himself had written in the character. The group maintained correspondence until at least 1682.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph L. Subbiondo, ''John Wilkins and 17th-Century British Linguistics'', John Benjamins Publishing (1992), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=aeJBAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA352  352f.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Lodwick's alphabet consists of a system of representing consonants systematically; symbols indicating [[place of articulation]] (labial, dental, palatal, velar, sibilant) are modified by indication of the [[manner of articulation]] (voiced, voiceless, aspirated, nasal). Vowels are added as diacritics. This approach is entirely parallel to the [[tengwar]] alphabet, developed by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Allan, ''An Introduction to Elvish'' (1978).
Dimitra Fimi, '' Tolkien, Race and Cultural History'' (2009:112).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lodwick may have been acquainted with [[Daniel Defoe]]. Francis' nephew [[Charles Lodwik]] (1658–1724), Mayor of New York City in 1694,  signed at Defoe's marriage as a witness, and Francis may have introduced Defoe to "[[Roscommon's Academy]]", a group founded by [[Lord Roscommon]] in 1683.&lt;ref&gt;Maximillian E.

'''Fritsche''' ('''Friedrich''') '''Closener''' (died before 11 March 1373) was a priest and historian of [[Strasbourg]]. His work was one of the first vernacular city chronicles, a type that became very common in [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] in the century that followed.{{sfn|Hegel|1876}}

Fritsche's father was Sifrid, a burger of Strasbourg, and his mother was Margareta Spirer. From 1343 Fritsche was the custodian of the ''Marienaltar'' in [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], where later he served as vicar of the large choir. In 1358 he received the prestigiuos [[prebend]] of Saint Catherine's Chapel.{{sfn|Gerber|1957}}

His most famous work is his ''Chronicle'',{{efn|''Kronika aller der bebeste und aller der romeschen keisere, die sit Cristus gebürte sint gewesen''{{sfn|Gerber|1957}}}} written in [[High German]] and connecting the history of his city, its region and its bishops with the wider world of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]]. He says that he finished this work on 8 July 1362, the same day an earthquake struck Strasbourg.{{sfn|Hegel|1876}} His sources included [[Martin von Troppau]], a version of the ''[[Sächsische Weltchronik]]'' and the ''Bellum Waltherianum'' of his predecessor, [[Ellenhard|Ellenhard of Strasbourg]], which he translated and incorporated.{{sfn|Gerber|1957}}

Fritsche also compiled a German–Latin dictionary, the ''Vocabularium seu nomenclator'', and a now lost order of worship for Strasbourg Cathedral around 1364, ''Directorium chori''.{{sfn|Gerber|1957}}

His most important works focused on the history of [[Georgian feudalism]], pagan religious beliefs of the Georgians as well as the Caucasian [[comparative mythology]] and the [[North Caucasian languages]].&lt;ref name="batsav"&gt;[http://www.batsav.com/pages/georges.htm Georges Charachidzé ✝ 1930-2010]. batsav.com.

Accessed January 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Georges Charachidzé was born into the Georgian émigré community of [[Paris]]. His father David Sharashidze (French: Charachidzé) (1886 &amp;ndash; 1935) was a journalist and a member of the [[Constituent Assembly of Georgia]] before being forced to leave his homeland following the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Soviet takeover of Georgia]] in 1921. Sentenced to death by the Soviet government, Charachidzé had moved to Paris, where he had married a young French teacher, who gave birth to Georges Charachidzé in 1930.&lt;ref name="batsav"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colisee"/&gt;

==Career==
Georges Charachidzé grew up speaking both Georgian and French. In 1953, he obtained the supervision of [[Georges Dumézil]], a leading French scholar of the Caucasus, for his doctoral thesis, which was published, in 1968, as his first book ''Le système religieux de la Géorgie païenne'' ("The religious system of pagan Georgia"). In 1965, he accompanied Dumézil to [[Turkey]] for a field-work study of the Caucasian communities, descending from the 19th-century [[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|refugees of the Russian conquest wars]] in the Caucasus. While in Turkey, he assisted Dumézil in the reconstruction of the vanishing [[Ubykh language]] and in recording its last living speaker, [[Tevfik Esenç]],&lt;ref name="batsav"/&gt; who died in 1992.

Charachidzé produced several studies on the pagan religious systems of the Georgians and other Caucasians, the Georgian feudalism, the [[Avar language|Avar grammar]], Ubykh texts, and the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]–Caucasian interaction. Charachidzé was a regular contributor to the long-running, Paris-based journal for Caucasian studies ''[[Bedi Kartlisa]]'', founded and sponsored by the Georgian émigrés [[Kalistrat Salia]] and [[Nino Salia]]. In 1985, Charachidzé, together with Dumézil, founded the successor journal ''Revue des Etudes Géorgiennes et Caucasiennes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/georges-charachidze/ Georges Charachidzé (1930-2010)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3509">'''Henricus Petrus Baard''' (1906 &amp;ndash; 2000), was director of the [[Frans Hals Museum]] from 1946-1972.

==Biography==
He was born in Amsterdam as the son of Cornelis W.H. Baard, the director of the [[Stedelijk Museum]], and though his father wished he would follow a career in the wood trade, he studied art history and accepted a job as a volunteer with the [[Rijksmuseum]].  In 1932 he was appointed scientific assistant of history there and as of 1939 he was put in charge of the art collection. When he succeeded [[Gerrit David Gratama]] as director of the Frans Hals Museum, he moved to the upper floor of the [[Jacobus van Looy]] house, where he stayed until it was sold in 1967. In the Frans Hals Museum he removed most of the paintings from the display rooms, firmly believing that visitors could better concentrate on fewer works rather than ambling aimlessly room in, room out, attempting to absorb an entire collection in one visit. He felt that a good museum visit should not last more than one hour. From 1953 he introduced "candlelight" evening opening hours that were popular until they were discontinued in 1971. He organized seminars and ordered the creation of a scientific catalog of all the works in the museum, which his scientific assistant Carla van Hees began but which had still not been finished by the time he died. In 1959 he moved all of the Haarlem [[schutterstuk]]ken to the new annex in the back of the building, where they could all be seen together. They still hang there.
  
His main achievement was the great international Frans Hals exhibition in 1962 and the scientific catalog that he published with it, that had contributions by Carla van Hees and the young [[Seymour Slive]]. Many distinguished visitors came to Haarlem for the show and he received and showed them around them personally. The show made 750,000 guilders for the city of Haarlem, and though he desired to purchase a 17th-century painting with the funds, the money was used instead to fund young artists in the [[Ateliers '63]].

According to the RKD he was scientific assistant at the Rijksmuseum 1935-1945 and from 1946-1972 he became museum director in Haarlem and is known for his research books on art history.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/439620 Henricus Petrus Baard] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; He managed the evacuation of the important artworks during the war to bunkers in the dunes.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;
He died in Haarlem.

The '''Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokastër''' ({{lang-sq|Qendrat historike të Beratit dhe Gjirokastrës}}) encompasses the cities of [[Berat]] and [[Gjirokastër]] in southern [[Albania]]. Gjirokastër was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] list in 2005 while Berat was added as a site extension in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/452/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]|title=Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokastra|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/569|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are inscribed as rare examples of an architectural character typical of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=UNESCO World Heritage Site|title=Museum-City of Gjirokastra|url=http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/569bis.pdf|website=whc.unesco.org|language=French and English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Berat]] is often referred as the city of a thousand windows and considered as one of the [[Architecture of Albania|architectural]] treasures of Albania. Traces from [[Illyrians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s, [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s are still evident and well preserved in the city with castles and mansions, old [[Church (building)|church]]es and [[mosque]]s and impressive wall paintings, [[icon]]s and [[mural]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=UNESCO World Heritage Site|title=Advisory Body Evaluation (ICOMOS) - Historic centres of Berat and  Gjirokastra (Albania)  No 569|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/569/documents/|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Icons from the Orthodox Communities of Albania - COLLECTION OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF MEDIEVAL ART, KORCË|url=https://helios-eie.ekt.gr/EIE/bitstream/10442/8555/1/INR_Drakopoulou_06_01.pdf|website=helios-eie.ekt.gr|page=20|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the centuries, Berat was the place where various religions and communities coexisted in peace.  
 
[[Gjirokastër]], referred as the city of stone, stretches on the steep side of the [[Drino river|Drino River]] valley overlooking the historic landscape with picturesque stone architecture framed by mountains at every side. As most of other [[List of cities in Albania|cities]] in Albania, Gjirokastër bears architectural treasures of various [[History of Albania|civilization]]s that previously conquered the region.

'''Historical linguistics''', also called '''diachronic linguistics''', is the scientific study of [[language change]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bynon|1977|page=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Principal concerns of historical linguistics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Radford|1999|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# to describe and account for observed changes in particular languages
# to reconstruct the pre-history of languages and to determine their relatedness, grouping them into [[language families]] ([[comparative linguistics]])
# to develop general theories about how and why language changes
# to describe the history of [[speech communities]]
# to study the history of words, i.e. [[etymology]]

==History and development==
Western modern historical [[linguistics]] dates from the late 18th century.  It grew out of the earlier discipline of [[philology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Linguistics: An Introduction|last=Campbell|first=Lyle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1998|isbn=978 0 7486 4601 2|location=Edinburgh|pages=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to [[wikt:antiquity|antiquity]].

At first, historical linguistics served as the cornerstone of [[comparative linguistics]] primarily as a tool for linguistic reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Routledge introduction"&gt;"Editors' Introduction: Foundations of the new historical linguistics." In. ''The Routledge Handbook of Historical Linguistics'' Routledge p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars were concerned chiefly with establishing language families and reconstructing prehistoric proto-languages, using the [[comparative method]] and [[internal reconstruction]].&lt;ref name="Routledge introduction" /&gt; The focus was initially on the well-known [[Indo-European languages]], many of which had long written histories; the scholars also studied the [[Uralic languages]], another European language family for which less early written material exists. Since then, there has been significant comparative linguistic work expanding outside of European languages as well, such as on the [[Austronesian languages]] and various families of [[Native American languages]], among many others. Comparative linguistics is now, however, only a part of a more broadly conceived discipline of historical linguistics. For the Indo-European languages, comparative study is now a highly specialized field.  Most research is being carried out on the subsequent development of these languages, in particular, the development of the modern standard varieties.

Some scholars have undertaken studies attempting to establish super-families, linking, for example, Indo-European, Uralic, and other families into [[Nostratic]].  These attempts have not been accepted widely.  The information necessary to establish relatedness becomes less available as the time depth is increased. The time-depth of linguistic methods is limited due to chance word resemblances and variations between language groups, but a limit of around 10,000 years is often assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldi|first=Philip|year=2012|title=Historical Linguistics and Cognitive Science|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Publications/External/Baldi_Dussias_Rhesis_2012_GD_09_13_2012.pdf|journal=Rheis, International Journal of Linguistics, Philology and Literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5–27}} p.&amp;nbsp;11.&lt;/ref&gt; The dating of the various proto-languages is also difficult; several methods are available for dating, but only approximate results can be obtained.

==Diachronic and synchronic analysis==
{{See also|Synchrony and diachrony}}
Initially, ''all'' modern linguistics was historical in orientation. Even the study of modern dialects involved looking at their origins. [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s distinction between [[synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic]] and diachronic linguistics is fundamental to the present day organization of the discipline. Primacy is accorded to synchronic linguistics, and '''diachronic linguistics''' is defined as the study of successive synchronic stages. Saussure's clear demarcation, however, has had both defenders and critics.

In linguistics, a '''synchronic analysis''' is one that views linguistic phenomena only at a given time, usually the present, though a synchronic analysis of a historical language form is also possible.  This may be distinguished from diachronic, which regards a phenomenon in terms of developments through time.  Diachronic analysis is the main concern of historical linguistics; however, most other branches of linguistics are concerned with some form of synchronic analysis. The study of language change offers a valuable insight into the state of linguistic representation, and because all synchronic forms are the result of historically evolving diachronic changes, the ability to explain linguistic constructions necessitates a focus on diachronic processes.&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, Joan L. "Diachronic Linguistics." The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, a purely synchronic linguistics is not possible for any period before the invention of the [[phonograph|gramophone]], as written records always lag behind speech in reflecting linguistic developments. Written records are difficult to date accurately before the development of the modern [[title page]]. Often dating must rely on contextual historical evidence such as inscriptions, or, modern technology such as carbon dating can be used to ascertain dates of varying accuracy. Also, the work of [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]] on linguistic variation has shown synchronic states are not uniform: the speech habits of older and younger speakers differ in ways that point to language change. Synchronic variation is linguistic change in progress.

Synchronic and diachronic approaches can reach quite different conclusions. For example, a [[Germanic strong verb]] like English ''sing – sang – sung'' is [[regular verb|irregular]] when viewed synchronically: the native speaker's brain [[neurolinguistics|processes]] these as learned forms, whereas the derived forms of regular verbs are processed quite differently, by the application of productive rules (for example, adding ''-ed'' to the basic form of a verb as in ''walk – walked''). This is an insight of [[psycholinguistics]], relevant also for [[Second language acquisition|language didactics]], both of which are synchronic disciplines.  However, a diachronic analysis will show that the strong verb is the remnant of a fully regular system of internal vowel changes, in this case, namely, the [[Indo-European ablaut]]; historical linguistics seldom uses the category "[[irregular verb]]".

The principal tools of research in diachronic linguistics are the [[comparative method]] and the method of [[internal reconstruction]]. Less-standard techniques, such as [[mass lexical comparison]], are used by some linguists to overcome the limitations of the comparative method, but most linguists regard them as unreliable.

The findings of historical linguistics are often used as a basis for hypotheses about the groupings and movements of peoples, particularly in the prehistoric period. In practice, however, it is often unclear how to integrate the linguistic evidence with the [[archaeological]] or [[Genetics|genetic]] evidence. For example, there are numerous theories concerning the homeland and early movements of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]], each with its own interpretation of the archaeological record.

===Comparative linguistics===
[[Comparative linguistics]] (originally '''comparative [[philology]]''') is a branch of historical linguistics that is concerned with comparing languages in order to establish their historical relatedness. Languages may be related by convergence through [[Borrowing (linguistics)|borrowing]] or by genetic descent, thus languages can change and are also able to cross-relate.

[[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|Genetic relatedness]] implies a common origin or [[proto-language]]. Comparative linguistics has the goal of constructing [[language family|language families]], reconstructing proto-languages, and specifying the changes that have resulted in the documented languages.  To maintain a clear distinction between [[attested language]] and reconstructed forms, comparative linguists prefix an asterisk to any form that is not found in surviving texts.

===Etymology===
[[Etymology]] is the study of the [[history]] of [[word]]s: when they entered a language, from what source, and how their form and meaning have changed over time. A word may enter a language as a [[loanword]] (as a word from one language adopted by speakers of another language), through [[derivational morphology]] by combining pre-existing elements in the language, by a hybrid of these two processes called [[phono-semantic matching]], or in several other minor ways.

In languages with a long and detailed history, etymology makes use of [[philology]], the study of how words change from culture to culture over time. Etymologists also apply the methods of [[comparative linguistics]] to reconstruct information about languages that are too old for any direct information (such as writing) to be known. By analyzing related languages with a technique known as the [[comparative method]], linguists can make inferences, about their shared parent language and its vocabulary. In that way, [[root (linguistics)|word roots]] that can be traced all the way back to the origin of, for instance, the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]] have been found. Although originating in the philological tradition, much current etymological research is done in [[language family|language families]] for which little or no early documentation is available, such as [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]].

===Dialectology===
{{Main|Dialectology}}
[[Dialectology]] is the scientific study of linguistic [[dialect]], the varieties of a language that are characteristic of particular groups, based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features.  This is in contrast to variations based on social factors, which are studied in [[sociolinguistics]], or variations based on time, which are studied in historical linguistics. Dialectology treats such topics as divergence of two local dialects from a common ancestor and [[descriptive linguistics|synchronic variation]].

Dialectologists are concerned with grammatical features that correspond to regional areas. Thus, they are usually dealing with populations living in specific locales for generations without moving, but also with immigrant groups bringing their languages to new settlements.

===Phonology===
{{Main|Sound change}}
[[Phonology]] is a sub-field of linguistics which studies the [[sound]] system of a specific language or set of languages. Whereas [[phonetics]] is about the physical production and [[perception]] of the sounds of speech, phonology describes the way sounds function within a given language or across languages.

An important part of phonology is studying which sounds are distinctive units within a language. For example, the "p" in "pin" is [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]], but the "p" in "spin" is not. In English these two sounds are used in [[complementary distribution]] and are not used to differentiate words so they are considered [[allophones]] of the same [[phoneme]]. In some other languages like [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the same difference of aspiration or non-aspiration differentiates words and so the two sounds (or [[phones]]) are therefore considered phonemes.

In addition to the minimal meaningful sounds (the phonemes), phonology studies how sounds alternate, such as the /p/ in English, and topics such as [[syllable]] structure, [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], [[accent (dialect)|accent]], and [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].

The principles of phonological theory have also been applied to the analysis of [[sign language]]s, but the phonological units do not consist of sounds. The principles of phonological analysis can be applied independently of [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] because they are designed to serve as general analytical tools, not language-specific ones.

===Morphology===
[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] is the study of the formal means of expression in a language; in the context of historical linguistics, how the formal means of expression change over time; for instance, languages with complex inflectional systems tend to be subject to a simplification process.
This field studies the internal structure of words as a formal means of expression.&lt;ref&gt;A ''formal language'' is a set of words, i.e. finite strings of letters or symbols. The inventory from which these letters are taken is the ''alphabet'' through which the language is defined. A formal language is often defined by means of a [[formal grammar]], but it does not describe their [[semantics]] (i.e., what they mean).&lt;/ref&gt;

Words as units in the lexicon are the subject matter of [[lexicology]]. While words are generally accepted as being (with [[clitic]]s) the smallest units of [[syntax]], it is clear that, in most (if not all) languages, words can be related to other words by rules. The rules understood by the speaker reflect specific patterns (or regularities) in the way words are formed from smaller units and how those smaller units interact in speech. In this way, morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies patterns of word-formation within and across languages, and attempts to formulate rules that model the knowledge of the speakers of those languages, in the context of historical linguistics, how the means of expression change over time. See [[grammaticalisation]].

===Syntax===
[[Syntax]] is the study of the principles and rules for constructing [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in [[natural language]]s. The term ''syntax'' is used to refer directly to the rules and principles that govern the sentence structure of any individual language, as in "the [[Irish syntax|syntax of Modern Irish]]". Modern researchers in syntax attempt to [[descriptive linguistics|describe languages]] in terms of such rules. Many professionals in this discipline attempt to find [[Universal Grammar|general rules]] that apply to all natural languages in the context of historical linguistics, how characteristics of sentence structure in related languages changed over time. See [[grammaticalisation]].

== Rates of change and varieties of adaptation ==
{{main|Conservative (language)}}
Studies in historical linguistics often use the terms "[[conservative (language)|conservative]]" or "innovative" to characterize the extent of change occurring in a particular language or dialect as compared with related varieties. In particular, a ''conservative'' variety changes relatively less than an ''innovative'' variety. These variations in plasticity are often related to the socio-economic situation of the language speakers. An example of an innovative language would be the [[American English]] language because of the vast number of speakers and the open interaction these speakers have with other language groups; these changes can be seen in the terms developed for business and marketing, among other fields such as technology. The converse of the innovative language is the conservative language, and these are generally defined by their static nature and imperviousness to outside influences. Most of these languages are spoken in secluded areas that lack any other primary language speaking population, however this is not a guarantee. These descriptive terms carry no value judgment in linguistic studies, and are not used to determine any form of worthiness a language has compared to any other language.

A particularly conservative variety that preserves features that have long since vanished elsewhere is sometimes said to be "[[Archaism|archaic]]". While there are few examples of archaic language in modern society, some have survived in [[set phrase]]s or in nursery rhymes.

== Evolutionary context ==
In terms of [[evolution (term)|evolutionary]] theory, historical linguistics (as opposed to research into the [[origin of language|origins of human language]]) studies [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] [[inheritance of acquired characteristics|acquired characteristics]] of languages.&lt;ref&gt;

We therefore must distinguish the cultural, or Lamarckian, evolution of language, a concern of historical linguistics, from its biological, or neo-Darwinian, evolution, a concern of developmental biology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7155">The '''Jewish copper plate''' is a [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copper-plate charter]] issued by the [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] king of [[Cranganore]], Bhaskara Ravi Varma (named as Parkaran Iravivanmar), granting land to a Jewish trader, [[Joseph Rabban]] of [[Cochin]]. Although the traditional date according to the [[Cochin Jews]] is 379 CE, the presently accepted date of this inscription is 1000 CE.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} It is the earliest evidence of a Jewish community settling in India, although local tradition has it that a previous settlement in Malabar dates to the early centuries CE.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

During the visit of Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] to India in 2003, the then provincial tourism minister [[K. V. Thomas|KV Thomas]] presented him with a replica of the copper plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharon delighted with gift from Kochi|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/09/11/stories/2003091108060400.htm|accessdate=6 July 2017|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|agency=UNI|date=10 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar replicas were also gifted by [[Narendra Modi]], the prime minister of India, to Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] during a state visit to [[Israel]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here’s what PM Narendra Modi gifted Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/heres-what-pm-narendra-modi-gifted-israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-on-his-israel-visit-4736447/|publisher=[[The Indian Express]]|date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Document==
The document records a royal grant to the Jewish chief Joseph Rabban of the rights of [[Anjuvannam|Ancuvannam]] along with the 72 proprietary rights enjoyed by high-ranking nobles of Chera kingdom. It is engraved on two small, rectangular copper-plates. The second side of the second plate is blank. A hole for the ring on which the plates must have been strung, is visible on the impression of each plate.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The inscriptions on the plates are in archaic [[Tamil language|Tamil]] written using the [[vatteluttu alphabet]].{{sfn|Fischel|1967|pp=230,236}} [[Grantha script|Grantha]] letters are used in a number of Sanskṛit words and for the foreign word "Issuppu".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The grant is cherished by the "White Jews" of Cochin as a historical document and their original settlement deed. It is carefully preserved in an iron box, known as the Pandeal, within the [[Paradesi Synagogue|White Jews’ Synagogue]] at [[Mattancheri]].{{sfn|Fischel|1967|pp=230}}

The plate is written in [[Malayalam]] using the [[Vatteluttu alphabet]]; the Jewish leaders signed in [[Judeo-Persian]] and [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]]. The translation of the charter reads:

{{quote|"Hail! Prosperity! (The following) gift was made by him who had assumed the title "King of Kings," His Majesty the king, the glorious Bhāskara Ravivarman, in the time during which (he) was wielding the sceptre and ruling over many hundred-thousands of places, in the thirty-sixth year after the second year, on the day on which (he) was pleased to stay at Muyirikkôdu:-

We have given to Issuppu Irappân (the village of) An̄juvannam, together with the seventy-two proprietary rights, the tolls on female elephants and (other) riding-animals, the revenue of An̄juvannam, a lamp in day-time, a cloth spread (in front to walk on), a palanquin, a parasol, a Vaduga (i.e., Telugu) drum, a large trumpet, a gateway, an arch, a canopy (in the shape) of an arch, a garland, and so forth.

We have remitted tolls and the tax on balances.

Moreover, we have granted, with (these) copperleaves, that he need not pay (the dues) which the (other) inhabitants of the city pay to the royal palace, and that (he) may enjoy (the benefits) which (they) enjoy. To Issuppu Irappān of An̄juvannam, to the male children and to the female children born of him, to his nephews, and to the sons-in-law who have married (his) daughters, (we have given) An̄juvannam (as) an hereditary estate for as long as the world and the moon shall exist. Hail!"|source=Translated by [[E. Hultzsch|Eugen Hultzsch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fischel|1967|p=231}}: Quoted from [[Epigraphia Indica]], 1894, Vol. 3, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The charter ends with a list of witnesses to the deed which includes the heads of five districts, the sub-commander of the forces, and the under-secretary who drafted the grant. A later translation is as follows:

{{quote|"Hail Prosperity (Svasti Sri), this is the gift (prasada) that His Majesty (Tiruvadi), King of Kings (Kogonmai-kondan), Sri Parkaran Iravivanmar, who is to wield sceptre for several thousand years, was pleased to make during the thirty sixth year opposite to the second year of his reign, on the day when he was pleased to reside at Muyirikkottu.

We have granted to Issuppu Irappan, the Ancuvannam (corporation/guild), tolls by the boat and by other vehicles, Ancuvannam dues, the right to employ the day lamp, decorative cloth, palanquin, umbrella, kettle drum, trumpet, gateway, arch, arched roof, weapons and rest of the seventy two privileges. We have remitted customs, dues and weighing fee.

Moreover, according to this copper-plate grant, he shall be exempted from payments due to the king (koyil) from settlers in the town, but he shall enjoy what they enjoy.

To Issuppu Irappan, proprietor of the Ancuvannam, his male and female issues, nephews, and son-in-law, Ancuvannam shall belong by hereditary succession as long as the sun and moon endure - Prosperity!"

Dežman described the fundamental characteristics of the crimes following the Second World War as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Joze Dezman, Communist Repression and Transitional Justice in Slovenia, in Peter Jambrek (ed.) Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the [[EUROPEAN UNION]], BRUXELLES, Ljubljana, 2008.

{{Quotation|Killing civilians and prisoners of war after the Second World War is the greatest massacre of unarmed people of all times in Slovenian territory. Compared to Europe, the Yugoslav communist massacres after the Second World War are probably right after Stalinist purges and the [[Holodomor|Great Famine]] in the Ukraine. The number of those killed in Slovenia in the spring of 1945 can now be estimated at more than 100,000, Slovenia was the biggest post-War killing site in Europe. It was a mixture of events, when in Slovenia there are retreating German units, collaborator units, units of the Independent State of Croatia, Chetniks and Balkan civilians; more than 15,000 Slovenian inhabitants were murdered as well. Because of its brevity, number of casualties, way of execution and massiveness, it is an event that can be compared to the greatest crimes of communism and National Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mp.gov.si/fileadmin/mp.gov.si/pageuploads/2005/PDF/publikacije/Crimes_committed_by_Totalitarian_Regimes.pdf European Public Hearing on "Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117160751/http://www.mp.gov.si/fileadmin/mp.gov.si/pageuploads/2005/PDF/publikacije/Crimes_committed_by_Totalitarian_Regimes.pdf |date=2012-01-17 }} Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union (January–June 2008) and the European Commission, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dežman was the first chairman of the [[Commission on Concealed Mass Graves in Slovenia]]. He contributed to the European Public Hearing on [[European Public Hearing on “Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes"|"Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes"]] organized by Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the [[European Union]] (January–June 2008) and the [[European Commission]] by writing the chapter "Communist Repression and Transitional Justice in Slovenia" for the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mp.gov.si/fileadmin/mp.gov.si/pageuploads/2005/PDF/publikacije/Crimes_committed_by_Totalitarian_Regimes.pdf European Public Hearing on "Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117160751/http://www.mp.gov.si/fileadmin/mp.gov.si/pageuploads/2005/PDF/publikacije/Crimes_committed_by_Totalitarian_Regimes.pdf |date=2012-01-17 }} Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union (January–June 2008) and the European Commission, pp. 197–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalinga''' is a historical [[List of regions of India|region of India]]. It is generally defined as the [[Eastern coastal plains|eastern coastal region]] between the [[Mahanadi]] and the [[Godavari]] rivers, although its boundaries have fluctuated with the territory of its rulers. The core territory of Kalinga now encompasses a large part of [[Odisha]] and northern part of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. At its widest extent, the Kalinga region also included a part of present-day [[Chhattisgarh]].

The [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalingas]] have been mentioned as a major tribe in the legendary text ''[[Mahabharata]]''. In the 3rd century BCE, the region came under [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan]] control as a result of the [[Kalinga War]]. It was subsequently ruled by several regional dynasties whose rulers bore the title ''Kalingadhipati'' ("Lord of Kalinga"); these dynasties included [[Mahameghavahana dynasty|Mahameghavahana]], [[Vasishtha dynasty|Vasishtha]], [[Mathara dynasty|Mathara]], [[Pitrbhakta dynasty|Pitrbhakta]], [[Shailodbhava dynasty|Shailodbhava]], [[Somavaṃśī dynasty|Somavamsi]], and [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga]]. The [[Bhauma-Kara dynasty|Bhauma-Karas]] were another important regional dynasty, although they did not call their kingdom Kalinga. At various times, the Kalinga region also formed part of the bigger empires, and gradually lost its distinct political identity after the Eastern Gangas.

== Extent ==

The Kalinga region is generally defined as the [[Eastern coastal plains|eastern coastal region]] between the [[Mahanadi]] and the [[Godavari]] rivers. However, its exact boundaries have fluctuated at various times in the history.{{sfn|R. C. Majumdar|1996|p=1}}

In the ancient Indian literature, the Kalinga region is associated with the [[Mahendragiri, Odisha|Mahendragiri]] mountain located in the [[Ganjam district]] of [[Odisha]], near its border with [[Andhra Pradesh]].{{sfn|Dineschandra Sircar|1971|p=167}}

At times, the southern border of Kalinga extended further up to the [[Krishna river]]. In the north, it sometimes extended beyond the Mahandi river, up to the [[Baitarani River|Vaitarani]] river. The Kalinga region did not encompass the whole of present-day [[Odisha]]: the north-eastern part of Odisha was included in the distinct [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]] region.{{sfn|Dineschandra Sircar|1971|pp=168-171}} Utkala gradually lost its identity, and came to be considered as a part of Kalinga.{{sfn|Mano Mohan Ganguly|1912|p=11}}

The eastern boundary of Kalinga was formed by the sea (the [[Bay of Bengal]]). Its western boundary is difficult to pinpoint, as it varied with the political power of its rulers. However, the [[Puranas|Puranic literature]] suggests that Kalinga extended up to the [[Amarkantak|Amarakantaka]] hills in the west.{{sfn|Chandramani Nayak|2004|p=6}}

Several ancient inscriptions mention the term "Trikalinga", which has been interpreted in several ways. According to one theory, Trikalinga refers to the widest extent of Kalinga. However, the [[Eastern Chalukya]] records suggest that Kalinga and Trikalinga were two distinct regions, with Trikalinga denoting the hilly region to the west of Kalinga.{{sfn|R. C. Majumdar|1996|p=19}}

== History ==

The name of the region is derived from a tribe of the same name. According to the legendary text ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the progenitors of the [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalingas]] and of their neighbouring tribes were brothers. These neighbours included the [[Anga Kingdom|Angas]], the [[Vanga Kingdom|Vangas]], the [[Pundra Kingdom|Pundras]], and the [[Suhma Kingdom|Suhmas]].{{sfn|Dineschandra Sircar|1971|p=168}}

The Kalingas occupied the extensive territory stretching from river ''[[Baitarani River|Baitarani]]'' in [[Odisha]] to the ''Varahanandi'' in the [[Visakhapatnam district]].{{sfn|K. A. Nilakanta Sastri|1988|p=18}} Its capital in the ancient times was the city of ''Dantakura'' or [[Dantapura]] (now ''Dantavaktra'' fort near [[Chicacole]] in the [[Ganjam district]], washed by the river ''Languliya'' or ''Langulini'').{{sfn|K. A. Nilakanta Sastri|1988|p=18}}

The [[Hathigumpha inscription]] suggests that a king named Nandaraja had excavated an aqueduct there in the past. Assuming that Nandaraja refers to a king of the [[Nanda dynasty]], it appears that Kalinga region was annexed by the Nandas at some point.{{sfn|Jagna Kumar Sahu|1997|p=24}} It appears to have become independent again after the fall of the Nandas. It is described as "[[Calingae]]" in [[Megasthenes]]' ''Indica'' (3rd century BCE):

{{quote|The Prinas and the Cainas (a tributary of the [[Ganges]]) are both navigable rivers. The tribes which dwell by the Ganges are the Calingae, nearest the sea, and higher up the Mandei, also the Malli, among whom is Mount Mallus, the boundary of all that region being the Ganges.|Megasthenes fragm. XX.B. in Pliny. ''Hist. Nat.'' V1. 21.9–22. 1.&lt;ref name="Megasthenes Indica"&gt;[http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/upload/Megasthene-Indika.pdf Megasthenes Indica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321164350/http://www.sdstate.edu/projectsouthasia/upload/Megasthene-Indika.pdf |date=21 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The royal city of the Calingae is called Parthalis. Over their king 60,000 foot-soldiers, 1,000 horsemen, 700 elephants keep watch and ward in "procinct of war."|Megasthenes fragm. LVI. in Plin. ''Hist. Nat.'' VI. 21. 8–23. 11.&lt;ref name="Megasthenes Indica"/&gt;}}

Kalinga was [[Kalinga under the Mauryan|annexed]] by the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]] in the 3rd century BCE. The headquarters of the Mauryan province of Kalinga was located at [[Tosali]]. After the decline of the Mauryan Empire, the region came under the control of the [[Mahameghavahana dynasty|Mahameghavahana]] family, whose king [[Kharavela]] described himself as the "supreme lord of Kalinga".{{sfn|Dineschandra Sircar|1971|p=167}}

Kalinga came under [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] suzerainty in the 4th century CE. After the Gupta withdrawal, it was ruled by several minor dynasties, whose rulers bore the title ''Kalingadhipati'' ("Lord of Kalinga". These included the [[Vasishtha dynasty|Vasishthas]], the [[Mathara dynasty|Matharas]], and the [[Pitrbhakta dynasty|Pitrbhaktas]].{{sfn|Snigdha Tripathy|1997|p=219}}

In the 7th century, the [[Shailodbhava dynasty|Shailodbhava]] king Madhavaraja II as well as the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga]] king Indravarman claimed the title ''Sakala-Kalingadhipati'' ("the lord of the entire Kalinga").{{sfn|Snigdha Tripathy|1997|pp=64-65}}

During 8th-10th centuries, the [[Bhauma-Kara dynasty|Bhauma-Kara dynasty]] ruled the region, although they called their kingdom "Tosala" (derived from Tosali, the ancient capital of Kalinga).{{sfn|Umakanta Subuddhi|1997|p=32}} The subsequent [[Somavaṃśī dynasty|Somavamsi]] kings called themselves the lord of Kalinga, [[Dakshina Kosala|Kosala]], and Utkala.{{sfn|Walter Smith|1994|p=25}}

During 11th-15th century, the Eastern Gangas became the dominant power in the region, and bore the title ''Kalingadhipati''. Their capital was originally located at Kalinganagara (modern [[Mukhalingam]]), and was later transferred to Kataka (modern [[Cuttack]]) during the reign of [[Anantavarman Chodaganga]] in the 12th century.{{sfn|Dineschandra Sircar|1971|p=169}}

Kalinga is also an important part of the legendary history of [[Sri Lanka]], as it was the birthplace of legendary [[Prince Vijaya]] according to the ''[[Mahavamsa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thera Mahanama-sthavira |title=Mahavamsa: The Great Chronicle of Sri Lanka |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBxpTwfTx4QC&amp;pg=PA196 |publisher=Jain |isbn=978-0-89581-906-2 |page=196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Kharotabad Incident''' refers to the deaths of four Russians and one Tajik citizen at a [[Frontier Corps]] (FC) checkpoint in [[Kharotabad]] area of [[Quetta]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], Pakistan in May 2011. They were shot on the basis of reports that they were suicide bombers. A police surgeon who testified against the official account was later also claimed to be shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-115862-Quetta-Cop-fired-after-Kharotabad-shooting-gunned-down|title=The News International: Latest News Breaking, Pakistan News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{externalvideo|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRpuPjTuEg Funeral of the victims]}}
== The incident ==
On 20 May 2011, a group of 4 Russian citizens and 1 Tajik, (3 women and 2 men) had been travelling in a rented car in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], a province of [[Pakistan]]. They had passed through several police checkpoints and even been searched, but as they approached another checkpoint in the Kharotabad neighbourhood of [[Quetta]], they exited the car and proceeded on foot.  A previous security checkpoint near the Quetta airport had sent a message to the place they were now that five [[Chechen people|Chechens]] were approaching the Kharotabad checkpoint.  The Frontier Corps soldiers and [[Balochistan Police]] manning the Kharotabad checkpoint came to understand that they were about to be attacked by Chechen suicide bombers and acted accordingly.  As the 5 travellers approached the checkpoint they were greeted with a volley of bullets and all fell to the ground.  There was a long period during which no firing was done, and during which several of the victims were still alive and moving, including the two women who were seen holding hands. One of the injured women on the ground waved her arm and pleaded for mercy. It is during that time that TV crews and many officers arrived on the scene.  Then another volley of bullets was fired at the group as they lay on the ground until no sign of life could be seen.  This second volley of bullets was filmed and photographed by many members of the Press and by Pakistani TV crews.  The corpses were then pulled away from each other with ropes tied around their wrists and ankles for it was feared that they wore suicide vests.

Initial news reports, that persistently only identified the five as [[Chechen people|Chechen]]s, indicated that they were suicide bombers that were in possession of grenades and explosives and that they had hurled grenades at police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/629631/five-chechens-killed-in-quetta |title=Five Chechens killed in Quetta |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was even a report of a Pakistani soldier killed in the "exchange" (a likely case of friendly fire). The day after the incident, the Quetta chief of police, Dawood Ahmad Junejo, stated in a Press conference that "The five Chechens were not killed in firing by security personnel, but in a bomb explosion".  He further stated that "five mobile phones, two diaries, 48 fuses, seven detonators, a computer disc and CDs were recovered from the alleged suicide bombers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Saleem |last=Shahid |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/630170/ccpo-claim-makes-killing-of-chechens-murkier |title=CCPO claim makes killing of Chechens murkier |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later reports in the media proclaimed that the foreigners had "little else except shampoo bottles", but was followed by conflicting reports and statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/182692/kharotabad-firing-incident-foreigners-had-little-else-except-shampoo-bottles/|title=Kharotabad firing incident: ‘Foreigners had little else except shampoo bottles’|date=5 June 2011|work=The Express Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daily [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] on Thursday quoted witnesses as saying that the suspects were unarmed, had put up no resistance to the security forces and appeared to be about to surrender when they were gunned down. Officials of a bomb disposal squad which searched the bodies after the shooting told Reuters that they found no explosives strapped to the bodies of the Chechens. They were unarmed and had no suicide jackets or explosives with them," one of the officials said. "Five valid and two expired Russian passports were found in a ladies' handbag lying with the bodies," the second official said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dawn.com/2011/05/19/chechens-killed-in-quetta-were-unarmed-witnesses/ |title=Chechens killed in Quetta were unarmed: witnesses |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=19 May 2011 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An autopsy performed on the bodies of the five Russians determined that all died from bullet wounds, and found no trace of explosives on their bodies.  One of the women was 7 months pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Abdul |last=Hafeez |url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2011/05/20/kharotabad-incident-autopsy-report-reveals-slain-woman%E2%80%99s-7-month-pregnancy/ |title=Kharotabad incident: Autopsy report reveals slain woman was 7-month pregnant |newspaper=[[The News Tribe]] |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later news articles revealed that the five had been forced to bribe their way through police checkpoints, where the policemen had even asked for sexual favours from the young women.  When a similar incident occurred at subsequent checkpoint, the group fled, asking their hired Pakistani driver to find a route to by-pass further checkpoints.  This is when their driver made them get out of the car and continue on foot.  The second checkpoint called the one where the shootout occurred to warn them about the car with the five Chechen foreigners.  One article stated that Policemen had taken all their money from them [as a bribe]," he said. "Then they prayed at a mosque along with the women. Local people told them to lodge a complaint at the [[Pakistan Frontier Corps|PFC]] check post against the police. The policemen, however, told the PFC people [by phone] that the five people were suicide bombers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=49549&amp;Cat=9&amp;dt=5/28/2011 |title=Dying to kill |first=Erum |last=Haider |newspaper=[[The News International]] |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/tribunal_in_pakistan_probes_killings_of_foreigners_in_quetta/24190273.html |title=Tribunal in Pakistan Probes Killings of Foreigners in Quetta |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A police surgeon who performed an autopsy on the deceased, Dr. Baqir Shah, while testifying in court, rejected the claim that the foreigners had attacked the police with hand grenades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/635981/kharotabad-victims-did-not-attack-with-grenades-police-surgeon |title=Kharotabad victims did not attack with grenades: police surgeon |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions in the Russian press ==

Although Pakistani TV broadcast film and pictures of the Russian passports found in possession of the victims, on 18 May the ''Russian Press'', the Russian news service printed an article titled "No confirmation Pakistan militants were Russian&amp;nbsp;– embassy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20110518/164096864.html |title=No confirmation Pakistan militants were Russian |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 May, the same news service reported that "The Russian embassy in Pakistan has so far received no official information on the identity of those killed.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20110522/164159919.html |title=Pakistan to investigate deaths of alleged 'Chechen militants' |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=22 May 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pravda]]'' did not cover the incident.

== Identities of the victims ==

One of the Russian passports is in the name of Olga Shreder, born in [[Yakutsk]] in the [[Sakha Republic]] of the Russian Federation, on 15 January 1992.  Her passport had been issued on 3 January 2006 and had expired on 3 January 2011.  She was not an [[Chechen people|ethnic Chechen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islambruederschaft.kalimattauhidmedia.net/IBimages/3460/dsfdf.jpg |accessdate=1 June 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://4176806.vkrugudruzei.ru/|title=В Кругу Друзей – социальная сеть|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2011, the Vice Consul of Russian Consulate in [[Karachi]], Mr Tural Dzhavadov, said that the five foreigners who died in Quetta were not Chechens.  "Four of the five persons appear to be Russian nationals and one of them looks like a [[Tajiks|Tajik]]. They are not Chechens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/633318/slain-five-were-not-chechen-says-russian-official |title=Slain five were not Chechen, says Russian official |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatives of some of the victims revealed that the pregnant woman was Olga Sherada, a Russian citizen, and that she was the wife of victim Nauman Tajik, a Tajik National.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Balcoh |first=Shehzad |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/186923/kharotabad-incident-relatives-of-chechens-identify-two-bodies/ |title=Kharotabad killings: Funeral of two foreign victims held in Quetta |newspaper=[[The Express Tribune]] |date=12 June 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kharotabad killings |newspaper=[[The News International]] |accessdate=3 August 2012 |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=52149&amp;Cat=2&amp;dt=6/12/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

The police surgeon who conducted the autopsy on the victims of Kharotabad shooting and who contradicted the police version that the five had died as a result of a grenade blast that they had themselves detonated, has been attacked and hospitalised in Quetta, a few hours after he testified in court.  A group of people pulled up outside a restaurant where he was eating and dragged the surgeon out and severely beat him up. He had to be rushed to the civil hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/188619/kharotabad-shooting-incident-police-surgeon-tortured/ |title=Kharotabad killings: Surgeon attacked 'over testimony' |newspaper=[[The Express Tribune]] |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A driver that had driven the five victims just before they were killed, retracted an earlier statement he had made, in which he had claimed the five were armed.  "I lied under duress that the foreigners were carrying hand grenades. The police threatened me with dire consequence" he claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baloch |first=Shahzad |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/187448/kharotabad-killing-driver-says-foreigners-were-unarmed-when-shot/ |title=Kharotabad killing: Key witness says he was intimidated into lying |newspaper=[[The Express Tribune]] |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 December 2011, it was reported that the police surgeon and key witness in the incident Dr. Baqir Shah was shot dead by unknown gunmen in Quetta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=29563 |title=Kharotabad forensic investigator killed in Quetta |work=[[Geo TV]] |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108031950/http://www.geo.tv/GeoDetail.aspx?ID=29563 |archivedate= 8 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/684033/kharotabad-killings-police-surgeon-shot-dead-in-quetta |title=Kharotabad killings: Police surgeon shot dead in Quetta |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=29 December 2011 |accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kharotabad Inquiry Report''' is a compiled judicial inquiry papers covering the prelude and causes of the police raid in [[Kharotabad]] area of [[Quetta, Pakistan|Quetta]], [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] province of [[Pakistan]] on 18 May 2011.&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=By Shehzad Baloch|title=Kharotabad incident : Judicial inquiry into Chechens' killing ordered|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/173082/kharotabad-incident-judicial-inquiry-into-chechens-killing-ordered/|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Express Tribune, 2011|date=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inquiry papers concluded by Justice Mohammad Hashim Kakar of [[Balochistan High Court]] and were submitted to the [[Government of Pakistan]] over the prelude and events leading the [[Frontier Corps]] to open fire on five Russian citizens.&lt;ref name="Dawn News"&gt;{{cite news|last=Saleem Shahid and Amanullah Kasi|title=Kharotabad report to be kept secret|url=http://x.dawn.com/2011/06/29/kharotabad-report-to-be-kept-secret/|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Dawn News|date=29 June 2011|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629091036/http://x.dawn.com/2011/06/29/kharotabad-report-to-be-kept-secret/#|archive-date=29 June 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After observing the papers of the events, Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani|Yousaf Gillani]] [[Classified information|classified]] the reports and marked it restricted papers in 2011.&lt;ref name="Dawn News"/&gt; No details of reports were made public by the government.&lt;ref name="Dawn News"/&gt;

===Synthesis and inquiry===
In May 2011, the [[Balochistan Police]], assisted by the [[Frontier Corps]], opened fired on five Russian citizens who were travelling without a [[Visa policy of Pakistan|Pakistani visa]] and other [[National Alien Registration Authority|immigration documents]].&lt;ref name="Dawn News"/&gt; Police officials earlier had claimed to have killed five "terrorists" on and were believed to be wearing suicide jackets, carrying weapons and about to attack a check post in Quetta.&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 2011"/&gt;

Before the judicial probe, Chief Minister [[Aslam Raisani]] had constituted a committee under the supervision of Chief Secretary Balochistan [[Mir Ahmed Bakhsh Lehri|Mir Bux Lehri]] to investigate the incident and submit a report within 10 hours.  Lehri recommended a judicial probe covering all the federal and provincial employees who were involved in the incident.&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 2011"/&gt;

As a result, Chief Minister Raisani formed a judicial tribunal comprising judges of the [[Balochistan High Court]] under the Balochistan Tribunals Inquiry Ordinance 1969. The papers were concluded under Justice Mohammad Hashim Kakar and duly submitted his report to Government of Pakistan over the cause of the incident.&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 2011"/&gt;

===Classified status===

The papers were quickly and officially declared as government observed after going through the report that recommendations made by the judicial tribunal could not be fully implemented.&lt;ref name="Dawn News"/&gt;

This is a list of monuments and memorials that were established as public displays and symbols of the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–1848 and its veterans on both sides. One of the most significant is the [[Mexico City National Cemetery]], one of the first U.S. national cemeteries. The U.S. did not start [[United States National Cemetery System|its official system of national cemeteries]] until an 1862 act of Congress authorized U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to proceed. However, on September 28, 1850, an American military cemetery was established in Mexico City in the aftermath of the [[Mexican–American War]].&lt;ref name=NCA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cem.va.gov/docs/factsheets/history.pdf |title=History and Development of the National Cemetery Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs / National Cemetery Administration |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other monuments and memorials in Mexico commemorate those lost in the Mexican side of the conflict, particularly the [[Niños Héroes]], seven army cadets who lost their lives defending [[Chapultepec Castle]] in Mexico City.  There are other monuments in Mexico City, and in [[Monterrey]], [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]], [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[San Miguel de Cozumel]], and [[Toluca de Lerdo]].

In the United States, "conspicuously missing" is any memorial to the Mexican–American War on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/11/23/wicked-mexican-american-war/|title=Our 'Wicked War'|first=James|last=Oakes|date=November 23, 2017|work=[[New York Review of Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But there are monuments in California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah.

==Mexico==
[[Helen Escobedo]] in the book ''Mexican Monuments: Strange Encounters'' notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Literally hundreds of monuments commemorate the Niños Héroes, the seven boys who defended the castle of Chapultepec alone against the American invasion in 1847.  According to legend the last one alive wrapped himself in the Mexican flag and jumped off the parapet rather than surrender.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Escobedo, Helen, ed., photographs Paolo Gori, essays by Nestor García Canclini, Rita Eder, Fernando González Gortázar, Jorge Ibargüengoitia, Jorge Alberto Manrique, and Carlos Monsivais, Mexican Monuments:Strange Encounters, Abbeville Press, New York, 1989 p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kentucky===
&lt;!-- Text commented out for duration of DYK expected April/May 2018, because we can't tell which offline sources in [[Kentucky War Memorial] support these statements.  It would be okay for these statements to be here, supported by info in the article, but not during DYK, where a rule requires every paragraph or item to have an explicit source apparently. *[[Kentucky War Memorial]], in [[Frankfort Cemetery]] in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]], unveiled in 1850. Sculpture by [[Robert Eberhard Launitz|Robert E. Launitz]].  The monument stands over the graves of 17 Kentucky soldiers who had fallen at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]], and on one side it lists officers killed in the Mexican-American War.  The monument also commemorates the fallen from the War of 1812 and from various Indian wars. 
A substitute shorter statement about the Kentucky Memorial follows, which does not assert any connection to the Mexican-American War...it is included here on basis that it is clearly explicitly supported by a direct source taken from the existing article, although the source cannot be consulted online.  I don't see how to make any other statements which can specifically be attributed to a given source.

During his reign, [[Pope John Paul II]] ("The Pilgrim Pope") made 104 foreign trips, more than all previous popes combined. In total he logged more than {{convert|1,167,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. He consistently attracted large crowds on his travels, some among the largest ever assembled. While some of his trips (such as to the United States and the [[Israel]]) were to places previously visited by [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] (the first pope to travel widely), many others were to countries that no pope had ever previously visited.

[[File:Pope-poland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Millions cheer Pope John Paul II during his first visit to Poland as pontiff]]
[[File:Pope John Paul II (1979).jpg|thumb|[[Pope John Paul II]], during his first U.S. visit in 1979, at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], New York City]]
Pope John Paul II's first foreign journey was a three-country visit to the Dominican Republic, Mexico and the Bahamas in January 1979. Some 18 million people were believed to have greeted the Pope during his stay in Mexico. 

The Pope's second foreign visit was to his homeland, Poland, in June 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/2/newsid_3972000/3972361.stm |title=1979: Millions cheer as the Pope comes home |date=2 June 1979 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hm9yCNtF?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/2/newsid_3972000/3972361.stm |archivedate=1 July 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was possibly the most significant of all his trips as it, according to some historians, set in train a series of events that led to the establishment of the Solidarity trade union, which was a key movement in the fall of Communism in eastern Europe. During his visit to Poland, John Paul visited Warsaw, Gniezo, Krakow, Nowy Tag, Auschwitz and Jasna Gora. The nine-day tour attracted millions of faithful.

The [[Pope John Paul II's visit to Ireland|Pope's visit to Ireland]] on 29 September drew immense crowds. 1,250,000 people, one quarter of the population of the island of Ireland, one third of the population of the Republic of Ireland, attended the opening Mass of the visit in [[Dublin]]'s Phoenix Park. Over 250,000 attended a Liturgy of the Word in [[Drogheda]] later that evening. Hundreds of thousands lined the streets of Dublin that night for a motorcade from Dublin Airport to the Presidential Residence in the Phoenix Park.

The following day, Sunday 30 September, included Masses in [[Galway]] (300,000), Knock (450,000) and a stop over at the monastic ruins of [[Clonmacnois]] (20,000). The final day of the visit began with a visit to the National Seminary in [[Maynooth]] (attended by 80,000). The final Mass of the visit was at Greenpark Racecourse in [[Limerick]] in the south of the country before 400,000 people which was more than had been expected.

John Paul II made his first visit to the United States in October 1979. He arrived in [[Boston]] on 1 October. The next two days were spent in New York City, where he addressed the [[United Nations General Assembly]], spoke to students gathered at [[Madison Square Garden]], and conducted Mass at the [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|original Yankee Stadium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1979/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19791002_usa-new-york_en.html |title=Holy Mass at Yankee Stadium – Homily of His Holiness Pope John Paul II |publisher=Vatican.va |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HEg9irNM?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1979/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19791002_usa-new-york_en.html |archivedate=June 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/final-papal-visit-yankee-stadium-pack-em-article-1.291249 |title=Final papal visit to Yankee Stadium will pack 'em in |first=Larry |last=McShane |date=March 30, 2008 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HEgGbcMa?url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/final-papal-visit-yankee-stadium-pack-em-article-1.291249 |archivedate=June 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=June 8, 2013 |quote=Benedict becomes the third Pope to say Mass in the iconic ballpark, joining Pope Paul VI in 1965 and Pope John Paul II in 1979. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for 75,000 people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Weigel|first = George |authorlink = George Weigel|title = Witness to Hope: The Biography of Pope John Paul II |publisher = [[Harper Perennial]]|year = 2005|page = 350|isbn = 0060732032|quote= On the night of his UN address, John Paul celebrated Mass for 75,000 in Yankee Stadium.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as at [[Shea Stadium]] to an audience of over 52,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Miner|first= Colin|url= http://www.nysun.com/new-york/pontiff-made-a-pair-of-colorful-nyc-visits/11605/|title= Pontiff Made a Pair of Colorful NYC Visits|work= [[The New York Sun]]|date= 4 April 2005|accessdate= 12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on 3 October and [[Des Moines, Iowa]] on the next day before arriving in [[Chicago]].

On 3 June 1980, he made a pilgrimage to [[Lisieux]] in northern France, the home town of [[Thérèse of Lisieux|St. Therese of the Child Jesus of the Holy Face]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thereseoflisieux.org/pope-john-paul-ii-visits-lisie/|title= Saint Therese of Lisieux – Pope John Paul II visits Lisieux, June 2, 1980|publisher= Thereseoflisieux.org|date= 2 June 1980|accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 he declared St. Therese the third woman [[Doctor of the Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thereseoflisieux.org/doctor-of-the-universal-church/|title=Saint Therese of Lisieux – Doctor of the Universal Church|publisher= Thereseoflisieux.org|year= 2009|accessdate= 16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1980 visit to France was the first by a pope since 1814 and his journey to [[West Germany]] in November 1980 was the first since 1782.&lt;ref name="LifeTribute"&gt;{{cite book|last = Sullivan|first = Robert|title = Pope John Paul II A Tribute|work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|year = 2000|page = 85|isbn = 0821226770}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:President and Mrs. Reagan meet Pope John Paul II 1982.jpg|thumb|The Pope with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]], 1982]]

On 18 February 1981, he beatified several martyrs, including those later [[Canonization|canonized]], [[Lorenzo Ruiz|St. Lorenzo Ruiz]] and [[Magdalene of Nagasaki]], in [[Manila]]. This was the first beatification to be held outside [[Vatican City]]. He became the first reigning pope to [[Pope John Paul II's visit to the United Kingdom|travel to the United Kingdom]] in 1982, where he met [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]] of the [[Church of England]]. This trip was in danger of being cancelled due to the then current [[Falklands War]] ({{lang-es|Guerra de las Malvinas/Guerra del Atlántico Sur|links=no}}), against which he spoke out during the visit. In a dramatic symbolic gesture, he knelt in prayer alongside [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Archbishop Robert Runcie of Canterbury|Robert Runcie]], in the See of the Church of England, [[Canterbury Cathedral]], founded by St [[Augustine of Canterbury]]. They prayed at the site of the martyrdom of St. [[Thomas Becket]], meant as a show of friendship between the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches. Pope John Paul II was the first Pontiff to visit Scotland. 300,000 of the [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Roman Catholic minority in that country]] celebrated Mass with the Pope at Bellahoustan Park. On this visit the Pope faced protest from Protestant Pastor [[Jack Glass]] and his followers. This visit had to be balanced for fairness with an unscheduled trip to [[Argentina]] that June.&lt;ref&gt;Weigell p. 435: "The hurriedly arranged papal visit became an opportunity to offer encouragement to a people suffering a bitter defeat."&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his trips, he stressed his devotion to the [[Virgin Mary]] through visits to various [[shrines to the Virgin Mary]], notably [[Knock, County Mayo|Knock]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Our Lady of Fátima|Fatima]] in Portugal, [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]] in Mexico, [[Aparecida]] in Brazil and [[Lourdes]] in France.

In 1984, John Paul became the first Pope to visit [[Puerto Rico]]. Stands were specially erected for him at [[Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], where he met with governor [[Carlos Romero Barceló]], and at [[Plaza Las Americas]].

The pope made a pastoral trip to [[Singapore]] in 1986, and was received by the
Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] in the [[Istana]]. Following that, the Pope made pastoral speeches concerning the Catholic doctrines in the [[National Stadium of Singapore]], which was viewed by a large audience.

===1990s===
The Pope's foreign travel programme for 1994 was suspended due to a fall resulting in hip-replacement surgery. Visits to Belgium, the United States, and Lebanon were cancelled as a result. The visits to Belgium and the United States took place in 1995, while the visit to Lebanon was delayed until 1997.

[[File:Pope John Paul II in Bosnia 1997a.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pastoral visit of Pope John Paul II to Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
There was a plot to assassinate the Pope during his visit to [[Manila]] in January 1995, as part of [[Operation Bojinka]], a mass terrorist attack that was developed by [[Al-Qaeda]] members [[Ramzi Yousef]] and [[Khalid Sheik Mohammed]]. A [[suicide bomber]] dressed as a [[priest]] and planned to use the disguise to get closer to the Pope's motorcade so that he could kill the Pope by detonating himself. Before 15 January, the day on which the men were to attack the Pope during his [[Philippines|Philippine]] visit, an apartment fire brought investigators led by [[Aida Fariscal]] to Yousef's laptop computer, which had terrorist plans on it, as well as clothes and items that suggested an assassination plot. Yousef was arrested in Pakistan about a month later, but Khalid Sheik Mohammed was not arrested until 2003. During this trip to the Philippines, on 15 January 1995, the Pope offered Mass to an estimated crowd of 4&amp;ndash;5 million in [[Luneta Park]], Manila, the largest papal crowd ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Folkard|first = Claire, ed.|title = [[Guinness World Records]] 2003|publisher = [[Jim Pattison Group]]|year = 2003|page = 102|isbn = 978-1892051172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Old ties and new solidarities: studies on Philippine communities |last=Macdonald |first=Charles J-H. |authorlink= |editor1-first=Guillermo Mangubat |editor1-last=Pesigan |year=2000 |publisher=[[Ateneo de Manila University Press]] |location=Loyola Heights, [[Quezon City]] |isbn=978-971-550-351-8 |page=193 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=x-OAJJNfD_kC&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=%22Little%20Manilas%22&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 September 1996, the Pope traveled to [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre]], France to meditate and pray st the adjacent tombs of Saint [[Louis de Montfort]] and Blessed [[Marie Louise Trichet]]. On 22 March 1998, during his second visit to [[Nigeria]], he beatified the Nigerian monk [[Cyprian Michael Iwene Tansi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Chidi |url=http://www.afrikaworld.net/tansi/index.html |title=Blessed Cyprian Michael Iwene Tansi |publisher=Afrikaworld.net |date=22 March 1998 |accessdate=6 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HmDvQI1q?url=http://www.afrikaworld.net/tansi/index.html |archivedate=1 July 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, John Paul II made a final trip to the United States, this time celebrating Mass in [[St. Louis]] in the [[Edward Jones Dome]].

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, he became the first modern Catholic pope to visit [[Egypt]], where he met with the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Pope]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria]].

In May 2001, the Pontiff took a pilgrimage that would trace the steps of his co-namesake, [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], across the Mediterranean, from Greece to [[Syria]] to [[Malta]]. John Paul II became the first Pope to visit Greece in 1291 years. The visit was controversial, and the Pontiff was met with protests and snubbed by Eastern Orthodox leaders, none of whom met his arrival.

In [[Athens]], the Pope met with Archbishop [[Archbishop Christodoulos of Athens|Christodoulos]], the head of the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]] in Greece. After a private 30 minute meeting, the two spoke publicly. Christodoulos read a list of "13 offences" of the Roman Catholic Church against the Orthodox Church since the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]], including the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|pillaging of Constantinople]] by Crusaders in 1204. He also bemoaned the lack of any apology from the Roman Catholic Church, saying that "until now, there has not been heard a single request for pardon" for the "maniacal crusaders of the 13th century".

The Pope responded by saying, "For the occasions past and present, when sons and daughters of the Catholic Church have sinned by action or omission against their Orthodox brothers and sisters, may the Lord grant us forgiveness", to which Christodoulos immediately applauded. John Paul also said that the sacking of Constantinople was a source of "deep regret" for Catholics.

Later, John Paul and Christodoulos met on a spot where [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] had once preached to Athenian Christians. They issued a "common declaration", saying, "We shall do everything in our power, so that the Christian roots of Europe and its Christian soul may be preserved. ... We condemn all recourse to violence, proselytism and fanaticism, in the name of religion." The two leaders then said the [[Lord's Prayer]] together, breaking an Orthodox taboo against praying with Catholics.

He was the first Catholic Pope to visit and pray in an [[Mosque]], in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]]. He visited the [[Umayyad Mosque]], where [[John the Baptist]] is believed to be interred.

In September 2001 amid post-[[September 11 attacks|September 11]] concerns, he travelled to [[Kazakhstan]], with an audience of largely Muslims, and to [[Armenia]], to participate in the celebration of the 1700 years of [[Christianity]] in that nation.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E2DA113BF932A1575AC0A9679C8B63 |title=Pope to Leave for Kazakhstan and Armenia This Weekend |last=Henneberger |first=Melinda |date=21 September 2001 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=11 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HmFFchjH?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/21/world/pope-to-leave-for-kazakhstan-and-armenia-this-weekend.html |archivedate=1 July 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope's final visit was to the [[Shrines to the Virgin Mary|Marian Shrine]] of [[Lourdes]] in the south of France.

The '''coinage of the Lombards''' refers to the autonomous productions of coins by the Lombards. It constitutes part of the coinage produced by [[Germanic peoples]] occupying the former territory of the [[Roman Empire]] during the [[Migration Period]]. All known Lombard coinage was produced after their settlement of Italy. The coinage originates from two distinct areas, in [[Langobardia Major]] between the last decades of the sixth century and 774, and in [[Langobardia Minor]], in the duchy of [[Duchy of Benevento|Benevento]], between approximately 680 and the end of the 9th century.

The earliest Lombard coins imitated contemporary [[Byzantine coinage]], and coinage under the names of the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombard kings]] was a later development. In the north the coinage consisted almost exclusively of [[Tremissis|tremisses]], while [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]] were also minted in Benevento. The southern coinage of Benevento and [[Salerno]], although distinguished from that of the north by various stylistic and typological characteristics, also took inspiration from Byzantine models until new types bearing regal titles were issued by [[Cunipert]] towards the end of the 7th century.

After Lombard rule was superseded by that of the [[Franks]] in 774, Lombard-style coinage was produced for some time afterwards. In [[Langobardia Minor]], the coinage was continued for around a hundred years.

While the coinage is largely in gold, silver coinage appears under the influence of the Franks in the end of the [[8th century]], alongside tremisses and solidi. Silver becomes the more prevalent metal only for the latest coinages, of the [[9th century]].

== Catalogues and sources ==

=== Lombard coinage ===
For the coinage minted by the Lombards, the most recent reference work is the first volume of ''Medieval European Coinage'', by Philip Grierson and Mark Blackburn. In the catalogues one therefore often finds a reference of type "MEC 1, 274", where MEC inidicates the initials of this work, 1, the first volume, and 274, the index number of the coin in MEC. Coins of Lombard mints are catalogued between 274 and 331 in the first volume of ''MEC''. The illustrations show coins of the collection of the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], [[Cambridge]].

A slightly more recent study, but more specialised, is that of Ernesto Bernareggi, published in Milan in 1983, under the title ''Montea Langobardorum''. In particular, it collects the various studies of the same author published since 1960. Reference to this work is made by "Bernareggi", followed by the index number. Other catalogues in common use include the "BMC ''Vand''", which covers the coinage of the Vandals and other migration periods groups present in the [[British Museum]], in 1911.

An important collection of Lombard coinages is found in the civic collections of [[Milan]], at the [[Sforza Castle]], and a catalogue of this collection was published in 1978 by Ermanno Arslan. This work is generally referenced as "Arslan", followed by the index number.

Less commonly used internationally, but equally relevant, is CNI (''Corpus Nummorum Italicorum''), which illustrates the collection of [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]]. Lombard coins are covered by volumes IV (Pavia and other minor mints of Lombardy), V (Milan) and XI  ([[Tuscany]]).

=== Byzantine coinage ===
The first coins issued by the Lombards were imitations of those coined in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]; the models used were those of [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice (582-602)]], [[Heraclius]] (610-641) and [[Constans II]] (641-668).

There are various recent catalogues which covers these issues; most important are the catalogue of the collection of [[Dumbarton Oaks]], abbreviated DOC, and ''Moneta Imperii Byzantini'' by Wolfgang Hahn, abbreviated as MIB. Maurice's coinage is catalogued in the first volume of DOC, and the second volume of MIB; the issues of Heraclius and Constans II are in the second volume of DOC and the third of MIB.

== Finds and hoards ==
Only five hoards have been found which contain non-pseudo-imperial coinage of the Lombards. Of these, only two have been published in any detail. 
* A hoard found at [[Ossi, Sardinia]] was described by Vincenzo Dessì in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Vincenzo Dessì, "I tremissi longobardi a proposito di un piccolo ripostiglio di monete d'oro di [[Liutprando]], rinvenuto presso il villaggio di Ossi (Sassari)", {{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/rivistaitalianad21sociuoft/rivistaitalianad21sociuoft_djvu.txt| title=''RIN'' 21 (1908), pagg. 295-311|accessdate=11 September 2009}} Ristampato in ''Gli scritti di numismatica'' (Sassari 1970), pagg. 225-244.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A hoard found at [[Ilanz]], [[Grisons]] was described by Fritz Jecklin in 1906,&lt;ref name="Jecklin"&gt;Fritz Jecklin, "Der langobardisch-karolingische Münzfund bei Ilanz", ''MBNG'' (Mitteilungen der Bayerischen Numismatischen Gesellschaft) 25 (1906-07) pagg. 28-79.&lt;/ref&gt; and was further studied by Bernareggi in 1977.&lt;ref name="BernareggiIlanz"&gt;Ernesto Bernareggi, "I tremissi longobardi e carolingi del ripostiglio di Ilanz nei Grigioni", ''Quaderni ticinesi di numismatica...'', 6 (1977) pagg. 341-364.&lt;/ref&gt;
We know little of the other hoards:
* A hoard of [[Landriano]] included [[Tremissis|tremisses]] of [[Ratchis]] and [[Aistulf]]. 
* That of [[Mezzomerico]] contained between fifty and a hundred tremisses of [[Desiderius]].
* The treasure of [[Biella]] included various silver coins and 28 tremisses of [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand.]] While the composition of the hoard is known, the exact provenance and mode of discovery are not. 
There also was a hoard found at [[Lucca]] in 1840, which included, beyond many local coins, a few of [[Aistulf]] and [[Desiderius]], but the coins were dispersed immediately, and there is little reliable information regarding the location or circumstances of the discovery or the exact composition.&lt;ref&gt;Giulio Cordero di San Quintino, ''Della zecca e delle monete di Lucca nei secoli di mezzo''. Lucca, 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Undid revision 858109091 by [[Special:Contributions/Moxy|Moxy]] ([[User talk:Moxy|talk]]) Because there is no evidence that the Maine penny had anything to do with the Vikings. The Viking Age was between 793 and 1066, the Maine penny was minted in Norway between 1065 and 1090. Minted in Norway after the Viking Age, this is Norse, not Viking.</comment>

The '''Maine penny''', also referred to as the '''Goddard coin''', is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[silver]] [[coin]] dating to the reign of  [[Olaf Kyrre]] King of Norway (1067–1093 AD). It was discovered in [[Maine]] in 1957, and it has been suggested as evidence of [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories|Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Discovery==
Guy Mellgren, a local resident and amateur archaeologist, said he found this coin on August 18, 1957, at the [[Goddard Site]]. This was an extensive archeological site at an old [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] settlement at Naskeag Point on [[Penobscot Bay]] in [[Brooklin, Maine]].&lt;ref name="norsepenny"/&gt; A 1978 article in ''Time Magazine'' called the discovery site an ancient Indian rubbish heap near the coastal town of [[Blue Hill, Maine|Blue Hill]].&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919916,00.html|title=Science: Bye, Columbus | date=December 11, 1978 | publisher=Time Magazine (Vol. 112 No. 24)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a lengthy period, a collection of 30,000 items from the site was donated to the [[Maine State Museum]]. The coin was donated in 1974.&lt;ref name="norsepenny"/&gt;

==The coin==
{{see also|Norwegian penning}}
Much of the circumstances of the finding of the coin were not well preserved in the record (as was the case with the majority of the 30,000 finds). The coin was at first mis-identified as a [[Great Britain|British]] penny from the 12th century. In 1978, experts from London considered that it might be of Norse origin. Today the identity of the Maine Penny as an [[Olaf Kyrre]] silver coin is not in doubt. Kolbjorn Skaare of the [[University of Oslo]] determined the coin had been minted between 1065 and 1080 AD and widely circulated in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The penny was found with a perforation, probably for use as a pendant. This area of the coin has since crumbled to dust from corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vinland Archeology|url=https://naturalhistory.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/archeo.html|website=naturalhistory.si.edu|publisher=Smithsonian Institute|accessdate=17 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norse origin==
The Goddard site has been dated to 1180–1235, within the circulation period of pennies of this type. The people who lived at the site at that time are generally considered to be ancestors of the [[Penobscot people| Penobscot]]. While the date is around two hundred years after the last of the [[Vinland]] voyages ({{circa}} 1000) described in [[Norse saga]]s, it is well within the period during which the Norse lived in [[Greenland]] (10th to 15th centuries) and could have visited [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, Patricia. (2000) ''The Norse and Native Norse Americans'' in William W. Fitzhugh and Elisabeth I. Ward, eds., ''Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga''  (p. 238-247. Washington, DC: The Smithsonian Institution)&lt;/ref&gt;

The penny's coastal origin has been offered as evidence either that the [[Norsemen]] from Greenland traveled farther south than [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] or that the coin might have been traded locally. However, the penny was the only Norse artifact found at the site, which according to substantial evidence was a hub in a large native trade network. For example, a single artifact generally identified as a [[Dorset (culture)|Dorset Eskimo]] [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]] was also recovered there, and may support the idea that both the burin and the penny could plausibly have come to Maine through native trade-channels from Norse sources in [[Labrador]] or [[Newfoundland]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Norsemen in Greenland: Recent Discoveries at Herjolfsnes'' by William Hovgaard (Geographical Review. Vol. 15, No. 4, Oct., 1925, pp. 605-616)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maine State Museum website favors the view that the coin was found at the site and is therefore evidence of Norse presence on the North American continent, although the Museum states "the most likely explanation for the coin's presence is that it was obtained by natives somewhere else, perhaps in [[Newfoundland (island)| Newfoundland]] where the only known New World Norse settlement has been found at [[L’Anse aux Meadows]], and that it eventually reached the Goddard site through native trade channels".&lt;ref name= museum/&gt; The Maine State Museum describes it as "the only [[pre-Columbian]] [[Nordic countries|Norse]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] generally regarded as genuine found within the United States".&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web | title= The Goddard Norse Coin | publisher= Maine State Museum | url= http://www.state.me.us/museum/anthropology/norsecoinpage.html | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091119071317/http://www.state.me.us/museum/anthropology/norsecoinpage.html | archivedate= 2009-11-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the possibility that it may be a hoax has been raised. Notably this Norwegian silver coin and other similar coins of that era were available on the open market during 1957. Thus Mellgren could have had the means and the opportunity to plant the coin at the site, or he could have been deceived by someone planting the coin – though it is unclear what the motive may have been.&lt;ref name="ANScabinet"/&gt;&lt;ref There are enough questions regarding the provenance of the coin to leave its archaeological significance unclear.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;Prins, Harald E.L., and McBride, Bunny, [http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/acad/wabanaki_peoples_vol1.pdf. Asticou's Island Domain: Wabanaki Peoples at Mount Desert Island, Maine, 1500-2000]  (Vol.1., pp.40-42. Boston: National Park Service, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; An assessment of the validity of the find by anthropologist [[Edmund Snow Carpenter]] concluded: "Not proven".&lt;ref name="norsepenny"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Carpenter|first1= Edmund|title= Norse penny|date= 2003|publisher= Rock Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Numismatic Society]] has stated that "There is no reliable confirmation on the documentation of the Goddard coin, and much circumstantial evidence suggests that someone was deliberately trying to manipulate or obfuscate the situation. The Norse coin from Maine should probably be considered a [[hoax]]."&lt;ref name="ANScabinet"&gt;{{cite web|title= Current Cabinet Activities |publisher= [[American Numismatic Society]] |url= http://ansmagazine.com/Spring05/Cabinet |year= Spring 2005 |deadurl= unfit |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150702092847/http://ansmagazine.com/Spring05/Cabinet |archivedate= July 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A November 2017 paper by Norwegian [[numismatist]] [[Svein Gullbeck]] suggests that the coin is a genuine find.&lt;ref&gt;

{{The Protocols}}
'''Philip Perceval Graves''' (25 February 1876 – 3 June 1953) was an Irish journalist and writer. While working as a foreign correspondent of ''[[The Times]]'' in [[Constantinople]], he exposed ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' as an [[antisemitic]] [[plagiarism]], fraud and [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ballylickeymanorhouse.com/history/ |title=The Graves Family in Ireland |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701191603/http://www.ballylickeymanorhouse.com/history/ |archive-date=2010-07-01 |quote=He was the London Times correspondent ... contributed to the exposure of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion as forgeries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Graves, eldest son of the writer [[Alfred Perceval Graves]] (1846–1931), was born in [[Ballylickey|Ballylickey Manor]], [[County Cork]], Ireland, into a prominent Anglo-Irish family. He studied in Haileybury and [[Oxford University]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]] in March 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence|day_of_week=Saturday |date=3 March 1900 |page_number=8 |issue=36080| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the elder half brother of author [[Robert Graves]].&lt;ref name=bal&gt;[http://www.ballylickeymanorhouse.com/history/ Ballylickey Manor History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701191603/http://www.ballylickeymanorhouse.com/history/ |date=1 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a correspondent of ''[[The Times]]'' in Constantinople from 1908 to 1914, he reported on the events preceding [[World War I]]. In 1914, as a British citizen, he had to leave the [[Ottoman Empire]] due to the war. In 1915–1919, he served in the [[British Army]] in the Middle East war theatre. As a captain in Army Intelligence in [[Cairo]] he worked with [[T. E. Lawrence]] on the '' Turkish Army Manual '' for the [[Arab Bureau]]. His uncle Sir Robert Windham Graves had been British Consul in [[Erzurum]] (1895) and financial adviser to the Turkish government (1912) and worked for Civil Intelligence in Cairo during the same period.
[[File:TheTimes exposes TheProtocols as a forgery.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Graves exposed the ''Protocols'' as a forgery in ''[[The Times]]''. 16–18 August 1921]]
After 1919, Graves reported from his own homeland on the [[Anglo-Irish War]]. He knew [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[W. T. Cosgrave]] and the various Irish leaders and was closely involved in reporting events in this critical period of Irish history. He later worked as a foreign correspondent in [[India]], the [[Levant]] and in the [[Balkans]] and before returning to London to work as an editor of ''The Times''.&lt;ref name=bal/&gt;

In 1921 he exposed ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' as an [[anti-Semitic]] [[forgery]] in a series of articles in ''[[The Times]]''.

His most monumental work was a 21-volume history of [[World War II]]. Graves received numerous international awards and titles, among which are French [[Légion d'honneur]] that he received for his work in British intelligence during the First World War&lt;ref&gt;Graves, R. P., Robert Graves: The assault heroic, Biography 1895-1926.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]].

In his journeys, Philip Graves developed an interest in [[entomology]] and published articles in scientific journals. He was member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]].

He retired in 1946 to Ballylickey Manor and dedicated himself mainly to zoological hobbies. Here he made a study of the Irish butterflies, being especially interested in the local sub-species. He restored Ballylickey House as a hotel, which was taken over by his son after his death.&lt;ref name=bal/&gt;

==Entomology==

Graves specialised in butterflies ([[Lepidoptera]]) of [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]], and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], often working with Robert Eldon Ellison, a career diplomat and
fellow Irishman (born in Wingstown, near [[Dublin]]).

His published work on insects reflects the strengths of his collection but not its extent. In 1938, for instance, he presented more than 2,500 specimens to the [[Natural History Museum, London]]. These are described in the catalogue of acquisitions Rhopalocera (Levant and Balkans). There are a few specimens, including an excellent series of ''[[Archon apollinus]]'' in the [[Ulster Museum]], [[Belfast]].

His published work on insects includes:
 
*Collecting Lepidoptera in Syria, 1905 ''Entomologist’s Rec. J. Var'' 18:125-6  (1906). 
*Collecting in Syria: [[Ain Zhalta]] in May -June 1905. ''Entomologist's Rec. J. Va''r 18:149–152 (1906).
*A contribution to the fauna of Syria ''Entomologist's Rec. J. Var'' 23: 31–36 (1910).
*Two new Lycaenid subspecies from the Lebanon ''Entomologist'' 56: 154–157(1925).
*The Rhopalocera and Grypocera of Palestine and Transjordania ''Trans. Ent. Soc., London'', 1925 17–125 (1925).
*with Ellison, R.E. The butterflies of the [[Jabal Quinesia]], Lebanon Entomologist's Rec. J. Var 40:177–180 ( 1938).

An account of Graves work in entomology is given in Hesselbarth, G.; Oorschot, H. van &amp; Wagener, S., 1975 ''Die Schmetterlinge der Türkei'', Band 2: 1179 – 1199 [B 2189:2].

He is commemorated in the subspecies of the Brimstone butterfly found in Ireland, ''[[Gonepteryx rhamni]] gravesi'' Huggins, 1956.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4041">The '''pre-colonial history of Zimbabwe''' lasted until the [[British government]] granted colonial status to [[Southern Rhodesia]] in 1923.

==Ancient civilization==
[[Image:Great-Zimbabwe.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Great Zimbabwe]] national monument.]]
Archaeologists have found [[Stone-Age]] implements, Khoisan cave paintings, arrowheads, pottery and pebble tools in several areas of Zimbabwe, a suggestion of [[human]] habitation for thousands of years, and the ruins of stone buildings provide evidence of more recent civilization. The most impressive of these sites are the [[Great Zimbabwe]] ruins, after which the country is named, located near [[Masvingo]]. Evidence suggests that these stone structures were built between the 9th and 13th centuries AD by indigenous [[Africans]] who had established trading contacts with commercial centers on Africa's southeastern coast.

The [[Mapungubwe]] people, a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking group of migrants from present day South Africa, inhabited the Great Zimbabwe site from about AD 1000 - 1550, displacing earlier [[Khoisa]]n people. From about 1100, the fortress took shape, reaching its peak by the fifteenth century. These were the ancestors of the [[Kalanga people|Kalanga]] and [[Shona people|Karanga]] people. The Royal Totem was Moyo. Today bearers of the Moyo Totem are found amongst The Kalanga people in Zimbabwe and Botswana as well as the Karanga people in the Masvingo area. According to Prof. Thomas Huffman (chairman of the wits school of Archeology, Geography and Environmental Studies) Kalanga was the language of the Mapungubwe Kingdom, which predates the Great Zimbabwe kingdom. He further suggests that the Karanga dialect could have emerged from Kalanga as a result of influence from Zezuru. However other researchers insist that Kalanga is a derivative of Karanga. They believe that Kalanga must have emerged as a result of corruption of the Karanga dialect by invading Ndebele. The later seems less likely if one considers that Kalanga is spoken in areas where the invading Ndebele did not penetrate. Unadulterated Kalanga is still spoken in Shoshong Botswana, where ruins similar to Great Zimbabwe are found. Other ruins similar to Great Zimbabwe are found in Lusvingo, Khami, Dlodlo and other areas where Kalanga is still the language spoken by the local communities. The self-designations Kalanga and Karanga are the same word pronounced differently because of the lexical shift of r to l characteristic of how the languages are related to each other.

==Medieval civilizations==
There have been many civilizations in Zimbabwe as is shown by the ancient stone structures at [[Khami]], Great Zimbabwe and [[Dhlo-Dhlo]]. The first major civilization to become established was the [[Mwene Mutapa]] (or [[Monomotapa]]s), who were said to have built Great Zimbabwe, in the ruins of which was found the soapstone bird that features on the Zimbabwean flag. By the mid-1440s, King Mutota's empire included almost all of the Rhodesian (Zimbabwean) plateau and extensive parts of what is now [[Mozambique]]. The wealth of this empire was based on small-scale industries, for example iron smelting, textiles, gold and copper, along with agriculture. The regular inhabitants of the empire's trading towns were the Swahili merchants with whom trade was conducted.

Later they formed the [[Rozwi Empire]], which continued until the nineteenth century.

==Ndebele invasion==
{{main|Matabeleland}}
[[Image:Matabeleland.png|300px|right|thumb|Matabeleland, 1887]]
The [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Matabele]] (Ndebele) people in the south arrived in 1834 -- [[Mzilikazi]] fleeing [[Shaka]].

'''Samuel Finley Breese Morse''' (April 27, 1791 – April 2, 1872) was an American painter and inventor. After having established his reputation as a portrait painter, in his middle age Morse contributed to the [[invention]] of a single-wire [[Electric telegraph#Morse System|telegraph]] system based on European telegraphs. He was a co-developer of the [[Morse code]] and helped to develop the commercial use of telegraphy.

==Birth and education==
[[File:MorseHouseCharlestown.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Birthplace of Morse, Charlestown, Massachusetts, c. 1898 photo.]]

Samuel F. B. Morse was born in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], the first child of the [[pastor]] [[Jedidiah Morse]] (1761–1826), who was also a geographer, and his wife Elizabeth Ann Finley Breese (1766–1828).{{sfn|Mabee|2004}} His father was a great preacher of the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] faith and supporter of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|American Federalist party]]. He thought it helped preserve [[Puritan]] traditions (strict observance of [[Christian Sabbath|Sabbath]], among other things), and believed in the Federalist support of an alliance with Britain and a strong central government. Morse strongly believed in education within a Federalist framework, alongside the instillation of Calvinist virtues, morals, and prayers for his first son.

After attending [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], Samuel Morse went on to [[Yale College]] to receive instruction in the subjects of [[religious philosophy]], [[mathematics]], and science of horses. While at Yale, he attended lectures on [[electricity]] from [[Benjamin Silliman]] and [[Jeremiah Day]] and was a member of the Society of [[Brothers in Unity]]. He supported himself by painting. In 1810, he graduated from Yale with [[Phi Beta Kappa]] honors.

Morse expressed some of his Calvinist beliefs in his painting, ''Landing of the Pilgrims'', through the depiction of simple clothing as well as the people's austere facial features. His image captured the psychology of the Federalists; Calvinists from England brought to North America ideas of religion and government, thus linking the two countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} This work attracted the attention of the notable artist, [[Washington Allston]]. Allston wanted Morse to accompany him to England to meet the artist [[Benjamin West]]. Allston arranged—with Morse's father—a three-year stay for painting study in England. The two men set sail aboard the ''Libya'' on July 15, 1811.

In England, Morse perfected his painting techniques under Allston's watchful eye; by the end of 1811, he gained admittance to the [[Royal Academy]]. At the Academy, he was moved by the art of the [[Renaissance]] and paid close attention to the works of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]]. After observing and practicing [[Figure drawing|life drawing]] and absorbing its anatomical demands, the young artist produced his masterpiece, the ''Dying Hercules''. (He first made a sculpture as a study for the painting.)

[[File:DyingHercules.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''Dying [[Hercules]]'', Morse's early masterpiece.]]

To some, the ''Dying Hercules'' seemed to represent a political statement against the British and also the [[Federalist Party|American Federalists]]. The muscles symbolized the strength of the young and vibrant United States versus the British and British-American supporters. During Morse's time in Britain, the Americans and British were engaged in the [[War of 1812]]. Both societies were conflicted over loyalties. Anti-Federalist Americans aligned themselves with the French, abhorred the British, and believed a strong central government to be inherently dangerous to democracy.

As the war raged on, Morse's letters to his parents became more anti-Federalist in tone. In one such letter, Morse wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I assert...that the Federalists in the Northern States have done more injury to their country by their violent opposition measures than a French alliance could. Their proceedings are copied into the English papers, read before [[British Parliament|Parliament]], and circulated through their country, and what do they say of them... they call them [Federalists] cowards, a base set, say they are traitors to their country and ought to be hanged like traitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morse |first1=Edward |last2=Morse |first2=Samuel |date=1912 |title=Letters of Samuel Morse 1812.

Although Jedidiah Morse did not change Samuel's political views, he continued as an influence. Critics believe that the elder Morse's Calvinist ideas are integral to Morse's ''Judgment of Jupiter,'' another significant work completed in England. [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] is shown in a cloud, accompanied by his [[eagle]], with his hand spread above the parties and he is pronouncing judgment. [[Marpessa]], with an expression of compunction and shame, is throwing herself into the arms of her husband. Idas, who tenderly loved Marpessa, is eagerly rushing forward to receive her while [[Apollo]] stares with surprise.

Critics have suggested that Jupiter represents God's omnipotence—watching every move that is made. Some call the portrait a moral teaching by Morse on [[infidelity]]. Although Marpessa fell victim, she realized that her [[eternal salvation]] was important and desisted from her wicked ways. Apollo shows no remorse for what he did but stands with a puzzled look. Many American paintings throughout the early nineteenth century had religious themes, and Morse was an early exemplar of this. ''Judgment of Jupiter'' allowed Morse to express his support of Anti-Federalism while maintaining his strong spiritual convictions. Benjamin West sought to present the ''Jupiter'' at another Royal Academy exhibition, but Morse's time had run out. He left England on August 21, 1815, to return to the United States and begin his full-time career as a painter.

The decade 1815–1825 marked significant growth in Morse's work, as he sought to capture the essence of America's culture and life. He painted the Federalist former President [[John Adams]] (1816). The Federalists and Anti-Federalists clashed over [[Dartmouth College]]. Morse painted portraits of [[Francis Brown (1784–1820)|Francis Brown]]—the college's president—and Judge Woodward (1817), who was involved in bringing [[Dartmouth College v. Woodward|the Dartmouth case]] before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].

[[File:94 Tradd.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Morse maintained a studio at [[Samuel Wainwright House|94 Tradd St.]], Charleston, South Carolina for a short period.]]

Morse also sought commissions among the elite of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Morse's 1818 painting of Mrs. Emma Quash symbolized the opulence of Charleston. The young artist was doing well for himself. Between 1819 and 1821, Morse went through great changes in his life, including a decline in commissions due to the [[Panic of 1819]]. Unable to stop the rift within Calvinism, his father was forced to resign from his ministerial position, which he had held for three decades. The new branch that formed was the Congregational Unitarians, Morse considered them to be anti-Federalists, as their beliefs were related to religious salvation.

Although Samuel Morse respected his father's religious opinions, he sympathized with the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Among the converts to Unitarianism were the prominent Pickerings of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], whom Morse had painted. Some critics thought his sympathies represented his own anti-Federalism. Morse was commissioned to paint President [[James Monroe]] in 1820. He embodied Jeffersonian democracy by favoring the common man over the aristocrat.

Morse had moved to [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. His commissions for ''The House of Representatives'' (1821) and a portrait of the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] (1825) engaged his sense of democratic nationalism.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} ''The House of Representatives'' was designed to capitalize on the success of [[François Marius Granet]]'s ''The Capuchin Chapel in Rome,'' which toured the United States extensively throughout the 1820s, attracting audiences{{sfn|Bellion|2011|pp=289–291}} willing to pay the 25-cent admission fee.

[[File:Samuel Finley Breeze Morse 001.jpg|thumb|right |&lt;center&gt;''The Chapel of the Virgin at Subiaco,'' 1830&lt;/center&gt;]]

The artist chose to paint the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], in a similar way, with careful attention to architecture and dramatic lighting. He also wished to select a uniquely American topic that would bring glory to the young nation. His subject did just that, showing American democracy in action. He traveled to Washington D.C. to draw the architecture of the new Capitol and placed eighty individuals within the painting. He chose to portray a night scene, balancing the architecture of the Rotunda with the figures, and using lamplight to highlight the work. Pairs of people, those who stood alone, individuals bent over their desks working, were each painted simply but with faces of character. Morse chose nighttime to convey that Congress' dedication to the principles of democracy transcended day.

''The House of Representatives'' failed to draw a crowd when exhibited in New York City in 1823. By contrast, John Trumbull's ''Declaration of Independence'' had won popular acclaim a few years earlier. Viewers may have felt that the architecture of ''The House of Representatives'' overshadows the individuals, making it hard to appreciate the drama of what was happening.

Morse was honored to paint the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], the leading French supporter of the [[American Revolution]]. He felt compelled to paint a grand portrait of the man who helped to establish a free and independent America. He features Lafayette against a magnificent sunset. He has positioned Lafayette to the right of three pedestals: one has a bust of [[Benjamin Franklin]], another of [[George Washington]], and the third seems reserved for Lafayette. A peaceful woodland landscape below him symbolized American tranquility and prosperity as it approached the age of fifty. The developing friendship between Morse and Lafayette and their discussions of the Revolutionary War affected the artist after his return to New York City.

In 1826, he helped found the [[National Academy of Design]] in New York City. He served as the Academy's President from 1826 to 1845 and again from 1861 to 1862.

From 1830 to 1832, Morse traveled and studied in Europe to improve his painting skills, visiting Italy, Switzerland, and France. During his time in Paris, he developed a friendship with the writer [[James Fennimore Cooper]].{{sfn|McCullough|2011|p=61–62}} As a project, he painted miniature copies of 38 of the [[Louvre]]'s famous paintings on a single canvas (6&amp;nbsp;ft. x 9&amp;nbsp;ft), which he entitled ''[[The Gallery of the Louvre]].''  He completed the work upon his return to the United States.

On a subsequent visit to Paris in 1839, Morse met [[Louis Daguerre]]. He became interested in the latter's [[daguerreotype]]—the first practical means of [[photography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Natale|first=Simone|date=2012-11-01|title=Photography and Communication Media in the Nineteenth Century|journal=History of Photography|volume=36|issue=4|pages=451–456|doi=10.1080/03087298.2012.680306|issn=0308-7298}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morse wrote a letter to the ''[[New York Observer]]'' describing the invention, which was published widely in the American press and provided a broad awareness of the new technology.{{sfn|Morse|2006|loc=Letter}}

==Telegraph==
[[File:Morse telegraph.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Original Samuel Morse [[telegraph]]]]

As noted, in 1825 New York City had commissioned Morse to paint a portrait of Lafayette in Washington, DC. While Morse was painting, a horse messenger delivered a letter from his father that read, "Your dear wife is [[convalescent]]". The next day he received a letter from his father detailing his wife's sudden death.&lt;ref&gt;Lightning Man&lt;/ref&gt; Morse immediately left Washington for his home at New Haven, leaving the portrait of Lafayette unfinished. By the time he arrived, his wife had already been buried.{{sfn|Bellis|2009}} Heartbroken that for days he was unaware of his wife's failing health and her death, he decided to explore a means of rapid [[telecommunication|long distance communication]].{{sfn|Bellis|2009a}}

While returning by ship from Europe in 1832, Morse encountered [[Charles Thomas Jackson]] of [[Boston]], a man who was well schooled in [[electromagnetism]]. Witnessing various experiments with Jackson's [[electromagnet]], Morse developed the concept of a single-wire [[telegraph]]. He set aside his painting, ''The Gallery of the Louvre''.{{sfn|Standage|1998|pp=28–29}} The original Morse telegraph, submitted with his [[patent]] application, is part of the collections of the [[National Museum of American History]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name="NMAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=306|title=Morse's Original Telegraph|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time the [[Morse code]], which he developed, would become the primary language of telegraphy in the world. It is still the standard for [[rhythmic]] transmission of data.

Meanwhile, [[William Fothergill Cooke|William Cooke]] and Professor [[Charles Wheatstone]] had learned of the [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] and [[Carl Gauss]] electromagnetic telegraph in 1833. They had reached the stage of launching a commercial telegraph prior to Morse, despite starting later. In England, Cooke became fascinated by electrical telegraphy in 1836, four years after Morse. Aided by his greater financial resources, Cooke abandoned his primary subject of [[anatomy]] and built a small electrical telegraph within three weeks. Wheatstone also was experimenting with telegraphy and (most importantly) understood that a single large [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would not carry a telegraphic signal over long distances. He theorized that numerous small batteries were far more successful and efficient in this task. (Wheatstone was building on the primary research of [[Joseph Henry]], an American [[physicist]].) Cooke and Wheatstone formed a partnership and patented the electrical telegraph in May 1837, and within a short time had provided the [[Great Western Railway]] with a {{convert|13|mi|km|0|adj=on}} stretch of telegraph. However, within a few years, Cooke and Wheatstone's multiple-wire signaling method would be overtaken by Morse's cheaper method.

In an 1848 letter to a friend, Morse describes how vigorously he fought to be called the sole inventor of the electromagnetic [[telegraphy|telegraph]] despite the previous inventions.{{sfn|McEwen|1997}}

{{quote|I have been so constantly under the necessity of watching the movements of the most unprincipled set of [[Patent infringement#"Piracy"|pirates]] I have ever known, that all my time has been occupied in defense, in putting evidence into something like legal shape that I am the inventor of the Electro-Magnetic Telegraph! Would you have believed it ten years ago that a question could be raised on that subject?|S. Morse.{{sfn|Morse|2013}} }}

==Relays==
[[File:Leonard D. Gale cph.3a00116.jpg|thumb|250px| Leonard Gale, who helped Morse achieve the technological breakthrough of getting the telegraphic signal to travel long distances over wire]]

Morse encountered the problem of getting a telegraphic signal to carry over more than a few hundred yards of wire. His breakthrough came from the insights of Professor [[Leonard Gale]], who taught chemistry at [[New York University]] (he was a personal friend of [[Joseph Henry]]). With Gale's help, Morse introduced extra circuits or [[relay]]s at frequent intervals and was soon able to send a message through {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} of wire. This was the great breakthrough he had been seeking.{{sfn|Standage|1998|p=40}} Morse and Gale were soon joined by [[Alfred Vail]], an enthusiastic young man with excellent skills, insights, and money.

At the [[Speedwell Ironworks]] in [[Morristown, New Jersey]] on January 11, 1838, Morse and Vail made the first public demonstration of the electric telegraph. Although Morse and Alfred Vail had done most of the research and development in the ironworks facilities, they chose a nearby factory house as the demonstration site. Without the [[Relay#History|repeater]],{{efn|Morse devised a system of electromagnetic relays. This was the key innovation, as it freed the technology from being limited by distance in sending messages.{{sfn|McCullough|2011|p=80–88}}}} the range of the telegraph was limited to {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}}, and the inventors had pulled {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} of wires inside the factory house through an elaborate scheme. The first public transmission, with the message, "A patient waiter is no loser", was witnessed by a mostly local crowd.{{sfn|McCullough|2011|p=80–88}}

Morse traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1838 seeking federal sponsorship for a telegraph line but was not successful. He went to Europe, seeking both sponsorship and patents, but in London discovered that Cooke and Wheatstone had already established priority. After his return to the US, Morse finally gained financial backing by Maine congressman [[Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith]]. This funding may be the first instance of government support to a private researcher, especially funding for applied (as opposed to basic or theoretical) research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audretsch|first1=etal|title=The Economics of Science and Technology|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|volume=27|issue=2|year=2002|page=159|doi=10.1023/A:1014382532639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal support==
Morse made his last trip to Washington, D.C., in December 1842, stringing "wires between two committee rooms in the Capitol, and sent messages back and forth" to demonstrate his telegraph system.{{sfn|Standage|1998|p=47}} Congress appropriated $30,000 in 1843 for construction of an experimental {{convert|38|mi|km|0|adj=on}} telegraph line between Washington, D.C., and [[Baltimore]] along the right-of-way of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]].{{sfn|Stover|1987|pp=59–60}} An impressive demonstration occurred on May 1, 1844, when news of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]'s nomination of [[Henry Clay]] for U.S. President was telegraphed from the party's convention in Baltimore to the Capitol Building in Washington.{{sfn|Stover|1987|pp=59–60}}

[[File:Samuel Morse plaque.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The first telegraph office]]

On May 24, 1844, the line was officially opened as Morse sent the now-famous words, "[[wikt:what hath God wrought|What hath God wrought]]," from the Supreme Court chamber in the basement of the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., to the B&amp;O's [[B&amp;O Railroad Museum|Mount Clare Station]] in Baltimore.{{sfn|Wilson|2003|p=11}} Annie Ellsworth chose these words from the [[Bible]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 23:23); her father, [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Commissioner]] [[Henry Leavitt Ellsworth]], had championed Morse's invention and secured early funding for it. His telegraph could transmit thirty characters per minute.{{sfn|Gleick|2011|p=144}}

In May 1845, the Magnetic Telegraph Company was formed in order to build telegraph lines from [[New York City]] toward [[Philadelphia]]; [[Boston]]; [[Buffalo, New York]]; and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]].{{sfn|Standage|1998|p=54}}  Telegraphic lines [[Timeline of North American telegraphy|rapidly spread throughout the United States]] in the next few years, with 12,000 miles of wire laid by 1850.

Morse at one time adopted Wheatstone and [[Carl August von Steinheil]]'s idea of broadcasting an electrical telegraph signal through a body of water or down steel railroad tracks or anything conductive. He went to great lengths to win a [[lawsuit]] for the right to be called "inventor of the telegraph" and promoted himself as being an inventor. But [[Alfred Vail]] also played an important role in the development of the [[Morse code]], which was based on earlier codes for the electromagnetic telegraph.

==Patent==
[[File:Samuel Morse with his Recorder by Brady, 1857.png|thumb|275px|&lt;center&gt;Morse with his recorder, photograph taken by Mathew Brady in 1857&lt;/center&gt;]]

Morse received a patent for the telegraph in 1847, at the old Beylerbeyi Palace (the present [[Beylerbeyi Palace]] was built in 1861–1865 on the same location) in [[Istanbul]], which was issued by [[Abdülmecid I|Sultan Abdülmecid]], who personally tested the new invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istanbulcityguide.com/history/body_mansions_palaces.htm  |title=Istanbul City Guide: Beylerbeyi Palace |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010112702/http://www.istanbulcityguide.com/history/body_mansions_palaces.htm |archivedate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected an Associate Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1849.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter M|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterM.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original patent went to the Breese side of the family after the death of Samuel Morse.

In the 1850s, Morse went to [[Copenhagen]] and visited the Thorvaldsens Museum, where the sculptor's grave is in the inner courtyard. He was received by [[Frederick VII of Denmark|King Frederick VII]], who decorated him with the [[Order of the Dannebrog]]. Morse expressed his wish to donate his portrait from 1830 to the king. The Thorvaldsen portrait today belongs to [[Margrethe II of Denmark]].

The Morse telegraphic apparatus was officially adopted as the standard for European telegraphy in 1851. Only the [[United Kingdom]] (with its extensive [[British Empire|overseas empire]]) kept the needle telegraph of Cooke and Wheatstone.{{efn|"It was in the month of J, a century ago, that Franklin made his celebrated experiment with the Electric Kite, by means of which he demonstrated the identity of electricity and lightning".{{sfn|NYT staff|1852}} }}

In 1858, Morse introduced wired communication to [[Latin America]] when he established a telegraph system in [[Puerto Rico]], then a Spanish Colony. Morse's oldest daughter, Susan Walker Morse (1819–1885), would often visit her uncle Charles Pickering Walker, who owned the Hacienda Concordia in the town of [[Guayama, Puerto Rico|Guayama]]. During one of her visits, she met Edward Lind, a Danish merchant who worked in his brother-in-law's Hacienda La Henriqueta in the town of [[Arroyo, Puerto Rico|Arroyo]]. They later married.&lt;ref name="NYJ"&gt;[http://nylatinojournal.com/home/puerto_rico_x/news_and_information/taking_the_pr_out_of_prt_3.html NY/ Rafael Merino Cortes, "Taking the PE Out of PRT"], ''NY Latino Journal'', 20 July 2006  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903080653/http://nylatinojournal.com/home/puerto_rico_x/news_and_information/taking_the_pr_out_of_prt_3.html |date=3 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lind purchased the Hacienda from his sister when she became a widow. Morse, who often spent his winters at the Hacienda with his daughter and son-in-law, set a two-mile telegraph line connecting his son-in-law's Hacienda to their house in Arroyo. The line was inaugurated on March 1, 1859, in a ceremony flanked by the Spanish and American flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elboricua.com/MiradorPuertorriquenoArchives.html |title=150th.

There is an argument amongst historians that Morse may have received the idea of a plausible telegraph from [[Harrison Gray Dyar]] some eighteen years earlier than his patent.{{efn|"'Harrison Gray Dyar of Concord erected the first real line and despatched the first message over it by electricity ever sent by such means in America. This may seem strange to most of our readers,' says Alfred Munroe in ''Concord and the Telegraph'', 'as the credit of this great discovery has been generally conceded to Prof. Morse, but the latter deserves credit only for combining and applying the discovery of others'".{{sfn|Swayne|1906|p=241}}}}

==Political views==
[[File:Foreign Conspiracy.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Cover of ''Foreign Conspiracy Against the Liberties of the United States'' by Samuel F.B. Morse, 1835 edition]]

Morse was a leader in the [[anti-Catholic]] and anti-immigration movement of the mid-19th century. In 1836, he ran unsuccessfully for [[mayor of New York]] under the [[anti-immigrant]] [[Nativism (politics)|Nativist Party]]'s banner, receiving only 1,496&amp;nbsp;votes. When Morse visited [[Rome]], he allegedly refused to take his hat off in the presence of the [[Pope]].

Morse worked to unite Protestants against Catholic institutions (including schools), wanted to forbid Catholics from holding public office, and promoted changing immigration laws to limit immigration from Catholic countries. On this topic, he wrote, "We must first stop the leak in the ship through which muddy waters from without threaten to sink us."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1892624 Jstor.org Billington, Ray A.

He wrote numerous letters to the New York ''Observer'' (his brother Sidney was the editor at the time) urging people to fight the perceived Catholic menace. These were widely reprinted in other newspapers. Among other claims, he believed that the [[Austrian government]] and Catholic aid organizations were subsidizing Catholic immigration to the United States in order to gain control of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Curran, Thomas J.

They will see that [[Popery]] is now, what it has ever been, a system of the darkest political intrigue and despotism, cloaking itself to avoid attack under the sacred name of religion. They will be deeply impressed with the truth, that Popery is a political as well as a religious system; that in this respect it differs totally from all other sects, from all other forms of religion in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Terry Golway |date=2007-02-09 |url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=3508 |title=America &amp;#124; The National Catholic Weekly – Return of the Know-Nothings |publisher=[[America (magazine)|America]] |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1850s, Morse became well known as a defender of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], considering it to be sanctioned by God. This was a position held by many Southerners and others. In his treatise "An Argument on the Ethical Position of Slavery," he wrote:

{{quote|My creed on the subject of slavery is short. Slavery per se is not sin. It is a social condition ordained from the beginning of the world for the wisest purposes, benevolent and disciplinary, by Divine Wisdom. The mere holding of slaves, therefore, is a condition having per se nothing of moral character in it, any more than the being a parent, or employer, or ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Morse |first=Samuel |year=1863|title=An Argument on the Ethical Position of Slavery in the social system, and its relation to the politics of the day |journal=New York, Papers from the Society for the Diffusion of Political Knowledge|number=12}} in {{Citation|title=Slavery Pamphlets # 60 |publisher=Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript library, Yale University}} Quoted in {{citation |title=Yale, Slavery, &amp; Abolition |url=http://www.yaleslavery.org/WhoYaleHonors/morse.html}} — an online report about Yale honorees and their relation to slavery&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Marriages==

Morse married Lucretia Pickering Walker on September 29, 1818, in [[Concord, New Hampshire]]. She died on February 7, 1825, shortly after the birth of their third child (Susan b. 1819, Charles b. 1823, James b. 1825). He married his second wife, Sarah Elizabeth Griswold on August 10, 1848, in [[Utica, New York]] and had four children (Samuel b. 1849, Cornelia b. 1851, William b. 1853, Edward b. 1857).

==Later years==
===Litigation over telegraph patent===

In the United States, Morse held his telegraph patent for many years, but it was both ignored and contested. In 1853, ''[[O'Reilly v. Morse|The Telegraph Patent case – O'Reilly v. Morse]]'' came before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] where, after very lengthy investigation, [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger B. Taney]] ruled that Morse had been the first to combine the [[battery (electricity)|battery]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[electromagnet]], and the correct battery configuration into a workable practical telegraph.{{sfn|Standage|1998|p=172–173}} However, in spite of this clear ruling, Morse still received no official recognition from the [[United States government]].

The Supreme Court did not accept all of Morse's claims. The ''O'Reilly v. Morse'' case has become widely known among patent lawyers because the Supreme Court explicitly denied Morse's claim 8&lt;ref&gt;Morse's actual language in his claim 8 was: "Eighth. I do not propose to limit myself to the specific machinery or parts of machinery described in the foregoing specification and claims, the essence of my invention being the use of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current, which I call electro-magnetism, however developed, for marking or printing intelligible characters, signs, or letters, at any distances, being a new application of that power of which I claim to be the first inventor or discoverer."&lt;/ref&gt;  for any and all use of the electromagnetic force for purposes of transmitting intelligible signals to any distance.&lt;ref&gt;The Supreme Court said: "Professor Morse has not discovered that the electric or galvanic current will always print at a distance, no matter what may be the form of the machinery or mechanical contrivances through which it passes. You may use electro-magnetism as a motive power, and yet not produce the described effect, that is, print at a distance intelligible marks or signs. To produce that effect, it must be combined with, and passed through, and operate upon, certain complicated and delicate machinery, adjusted and arranged upon philosophical principles, and prepared by the highest mechanical skill. And it is the high praise of Professor Morse, that he has been able, by a new combination of known powers, of which electro-magnetism is one, to discover a method by which intelligible marks or signs may be printed at a distance. And for the method or process thus discovered, he is entitled to a patent. But he has not discovered that the electro-magnetic current, used as motive power, in any other method, and with any other combination, will do as well."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TelRelays.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.1|Morse's "repeater" circuit for telegraphy was the basis for the Supreme Court's holding some claims of Morse's patent valid.]]
The Supreme Court sustained, however, Morse's claim to such telecommunication when effectuated by means of Morse's inventive "repeater" apparatus. This was an electrical circuit in which a cascade of many sets comprising a relay and a battery were connected in series, so that when each relay closed, it closed a circuit to cause the next battery to power the succeeding relay, as suggested in the accompanying figure. This caused Morse's signal to pass along the cascade without degrading into noise as its amplitude decreased with the distance traveled. (Each time the amplitude of the signal approaches the noise level, the repeater [in effect, a nonlinear amplifier] boosts the signal amplitude well above the noise level.) This use of "repeaters" permitted a message to be sent to great distances, which was previously not feasible.
[[Image:SigDecays.jpg|upright=1.1|thumb|Effect of repeaters]]
The Supreme Court thus held that Morse could properly claim a patent monopoly on the system or process of transmitting signals at any distance by means of the repeater circuitry indicated above, but he could not properly claim a monopoly over any and all uses of electromagnetic force to transmit signals. The apparatus limitation in the former type of claim limited the patent monopoly to what Morse taught and gave the world. The lack of that limitation in the latter type of claim (i.e., claim 8) both gave Morse more than was commensurate with what he had contributed to society and discouraged the inventive efforts of others who might come up with different and/or better ways to send signals at a distance using the electromagnetic force.&lt;ref&gt;See ''O'Reilly v. Morse'', 56 U.S. 62, 113, 120 (1853).&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem that Morse faced (the deterioration of the signal with distance)&lt;ref&gt;The Supreme Court said, "The great difficulty in their way was the fact that the galvanic current, however strong in the beginning, became gradually weaker as it advanced on the wire; and was not strong enough to produce a mechanical effect, after a certain distance had been traversed." 56 U.S. at 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and how he solved it is discussed in more detail in the article ''[[O'Reilly v. Morse]]''. In summary, the solution, as the Supreme Court stated, was the repeater apparatus described in the preceding paragraphs.

The importance of this legal precedent in patent law cannot be overstated, as it became the foundation of the law governing the eligibility of computer program-implemented inventions (as well as inventions implementing natural laws) to be granted patents.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd v CLS Bank International'', 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014); ''Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Labs., Inc.'', 566 U.S. __, 132 S. Ct. 1289 (2012); ''Bilski v. Kappos'', 561 U.S. 593, 130 S. Ct. 3218 (2010); ''Gottschalk v. Benson'', 409 U.S. 63 (1972) – all building on the ''Morse'' case as the seminal case in the field.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign recognition===
[[File:Samuel Morse.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Samuel F. B. Morse taken by [[Mathew Brady]], in 1866. Medals worn (from wearer's right to left, top row): [[Order of Glory (Ottoman Empire)|Nichan Iftikhar]] (Ottoman); [[Order of the Tower and Sword]] (Portugal); [[Order of the Dannebrog]] (Denmark); [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Imperial Germany|Gold Medal of Art and Science]] (Württemberg); [[Legion of Honour]] (France); [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]] (Italy). Bottom row: [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] (Spain)]]

Assisted by the [[U.S. Ambassador to France|American ambassador]] in Paris, the governments of Europe were approached about their long neglect of Morse while their countries were using his invention. There was a widespread recognition that something must be done, and in 1858 Morse was awarded the sum of 400,000 [[French franc]]s (equivalent to about $80,000 at the time) by the governments of [[France]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Piedmont]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[Tuscany]], and [[Turkey]], each of which contributed a share according to the number of Morse instruments in use in each country.{{sfn|Standage|1998|p=174}} In 1858, he was also elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

===Transatlantic cable===

Morse lent his support to [[Cyrus West Field]]'s ambitious plan to construct the first transoceanic telegraph line. Morse had experimented with underwater telegraph circuits since 1842. He invested $10,000 in Field's [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]], took a seat on its board of directors, and was appointed honorary "Electrician".{{sfn|Carter|1968|p=104}} In 1856, Morse traveled to London to help [[Charles Tilston Bright]] and [[Edward Whitehouse]] test a 2,000-mile-length of spooled cable.{{sfn|Carter|1968|p=123}}

After the first two cable-laying attempts failed, Field reorganized the project, removing Morse from direct involvement.{{sfn|Carter|1968|p=149}} Though the cable broke three times during the third attempt, it was successfully repaired, and the first transatlantic telegraph messages were sent in 1858. The cable failed after just three months of use. Though Field had to wait out the Civil War, the cable laid in 1866 proved more durable, and the era of reliable transatlantic telegraph service had begun.

In addition to the telegraph, Morse invented a marble-cutting [[machine]] that could carve [[dimension|three-dimensional]] [[sculpture]]s in marble or stone. He could not patent it, however, because of an existing 1820 [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)|Thomas Blanchard]] design.

===Last years and death===
Samuel Morse gave large sums to charity. He also became interested in the relationship of science and religion and provided the funds to establish a lectureship on "the relation of the Bible to the Sciences".{{sfn|Standage|1998|p=189}} Though he was rarely awarded any royalties for the later uses and implementations of his inventions, he was able to live comfortably.

He died in New York City on April 2, 1872,{{sfn|Invent Now staff|2007}} and was interred at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]]. By the time of his death, his estate was valued at some $500,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|500000|1872|r=0}}}} today).{{Inflation-fn|US}}

==Honors and awards==
[[File:Morse statue 72 jeh.JPG| right | thumb |upright|Statue of Samuel F. B. Morse by Byron M. Picket, [[Central Park|New York's Central Park]], dedicated 1871]]
[[File:Samuel FB Morse 1940 Issue-2c.jpg|thumb|upright|upright=1.1|Morse was honored on the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#Famous Americans Series of 1940|US Famous Americans Series]] postal issue of 1940.]]

Morse was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistm|title=MemberListM|work=American Antiquarian Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite honors and financial awards received from foreign countries, there was no such recognition in the U.S. until he neared the end of his life when on June 10, 1871, a bronze statue of Samuel Morse was unveiled in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]]. An engraved portrait of Morse appeared on the reverse side of the [[United States two-dollar bill]] [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificate]] series of 1896. He was depicted along with [[Robert Fulton]]. An example can be seen on the website of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco]]'s website in their "American Currency Exhibit":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frbsf.org/currency/metal/silvercerts/581.html |title=American Currency Exhibit: Silver Certificate, $2, 1896 |publisher=Frbsf.org |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[blue plaque]] was erected to commemorate him at 141 Cleveland Street, [[London]], where he lived from 1812 to 1815.

According to his ''The New York Times'' obituary published on April 3, 1872, Morse received respectively the decoration of the [[Order of Glory (Ottoman Empire)|Atiq Nishan-i-Iftikhar]] (English: Order of Glory) [first medal on wearer's right depicted in photo of Morse with medals], set in diamonds, from [[Abdülmecid I|Sultan Abdülmecid]] of Turkey (c.1847&lt;ref&gt;According to [http://www.ptt.gov.tr/tr/genel/etelgraf.php Turkish PTT e-telegraph page history section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911035500/http://www.ptt.gov.tr/tr/genel/etelgraf.php |date=2009-09-11 }}, the Ottoman ruler was the first head of state to award a medal to Morse and it was issued after the demonstration in Istanbul.&lt;/ref&gt;), a "golden snuff box containing the Prussian gold medal for scientific merit" from the King of Prussia (1851); the ''Great Gold Medal of Arts and Sciences'' from the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Imperial Germany|King of Württemberg]] (1852); and the ''Great Golden Medal of Science and Arts'' from [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor of Austria]] (1855); a cross of Chevalier in the [[Légion d'honneur]] from the Emperor of France; the ''Cross of a Knight'' of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]] from the King of Denmark (1856); the Cross of Knight Commander of the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]], from the Queen of Spain, besides being elected member of innumerable scientific and art societies in this [United States] and other countries. Other awards include [[Order of the Tower and Sword]] from the kingdom of Portugal (1860), and Italy conferred on him the insignia of chevalier of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]] in 1864. Morse's telegraph was recognized as an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Demonstration_of_Practical_Telegraphy,_1838 |title=Milestones:Demonstration of Practical Telegraphy, 1838 |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Morse was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]].

On April 1, 2012, Google announced the release of "Gmail Tap", an [[April Fools' Day]] joke that allowed users to use Morse Code to send text from their mobile phones. Morse's great-great-grandnephew Reed Morse—a Google engineer—was instrumental in the prank, which became a real product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.google.com/mail/help/promos/tap/index.html Introducing Gmail Tap].

{{History of Scotland}}
The '''Scottish Enlightenment''' ({{lang-sco|Scots Enlichtenment}}, {{lang-gd|Soillseachadh na h-Alba}}) was the period in [[History of Scotland#18th century|18th and early 19th century Scotland]] characterised by an outpouring of intellectual and scientific accomplishments. By the eighteenth century, Scotland had a network of parish schools in the Lowlands and four universities. The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as [[The Select Society]] and, later, [[The Poker Club]] as well as within Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|ancient universities]] ([[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title='Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership', in Stephen Brown and Warren McDougall (eds.), The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Vol. II: Enlightenment and Expansion, 1707–1800|date=2012|publisher=University of Edinburgh|location=Edinburgh|pages=297–309|url=https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. M. Towsey (2010). ''Reading the Scottish Enlightenment: Books and Their Readers in Provincial Scotland, 1750–1820''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing the [[humanism|humanist]] and [[Rationalism|rationalist]] outlook of the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] of the same time period, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason. In Scotland, the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing [[empiricism]] and practicality where the chief values were improvement, virtue, and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole.

Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy, political economy, engineering, architecture, medicine, geology, archaeology, law, agriculture, chemistry and sociology. Among the Scottish thinkers and scientists of the period were [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[Robert Burns]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Playfair]], [[Joseph Black]] and [[James Hutton]].

The Scottish Enlightenment had effects far beyond Scotland, not only because of the esteem in which Scottish achievements were held outside Scotland, but also because its ideas and attitudes were carried all over Europe and across the [[Atlantic world]] as part of the [[Scottish diaspora]], and by European and American students who studied in Scotland.

==Background==
The roots of the Scottish Enlightenment can be traced to the seventeenth century, when there was impressive Scottish activity and engagement in law, science, medicine, and economics with the European continent. The Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was a natural development of this earlier engagement and advancement of knowledge.

Union with England in 1707 meant the end of the Scottish Parliament and independence. The parliamentarians, politicians, aristocrats, and [[Wikt:placeman|placemen]] moved to London. Scottish law, however, remained entirely separate from English law, so the civil law courts, lawyers and jurists remained behind in Edinburgh. The headquarters and leadership of the [[Church of Scotland]] also remained, as did the universities and the medical establishment. The lawyers and the divines, together with the professors, intellectuals, medical men, scientists and architects formed a new [[middle class]] elite that dominated urban Scotland and facilitated the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Broadie, ''The Scottish Enlightenment'' (1997) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (2001) pp. 133–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth===
{{Main article|Economy of Scotland in the early modern era}}
At the union of 1707, England had about five times the population of Scotland and about 36 times as much wealth, but there were four Scottish universities (St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) against two English. Scotland experienced the beginnings of economic expansion that allowed it to close this gap.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Campbell, "The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. II: The Economic Consequences", ''Economic History Review'', vol. 16, April 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Contacts with England led to a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. Although some estate holders improved the quality of life of their displaced workers, enclosures led to unemployment and forced migrations to the burghs or abroad.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, pp. 288–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The major change in international trade was the rapid expansion of the Americas as a market.&lt;ref name=Mackie1991p292&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow particularly benefited from this new trade; initially supplying the colonies with manufactured goods, it emerged as the focus of the tobacco trade, re-exporting particularly to France. The merchants dealing in this lucrative business became the wealthy [[tobacco lord]]s, who dominated the city for most of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Banking also developed in this period. The [[Bank of Scotland]], founded in 1695 was suspected of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathies, and so a rival [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] was founded in 1727. Local banks began to be established in burghs like Glasgow and Ayr. These made capital available for business, and the improvement of roads and trade.&lt;ref name=Mackie1991p297&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education system===
{{Main article|Education in early modern Scotland}}
The humanist-inspired emphasis on education in Scotland culminated in the passing of the [[Education Act 1496]], which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools.&lt;ref name=Bawcutt&amp;Williams2006pp29-30&gt;P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, ''A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry'' (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), {{ISBN|1-84384-096-0}}, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The aims of a network of parish schools were taken up as part of the Protestant programme in the 16th century and a series of acts of the Privy Council and Parliament in [[School Establishment Act 1616|1616]], [[Education Act 1633|1633]], [[Education Act 1646|1646]] and 1696 attempted to support its development and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |title=School education prior to 1873 |journal=Scottish Archive Network |year=2010 |url=http://www.scan.org.uk/knowledgebase/topics/education_box1.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zt4xQMkX?url=http://www.scan.org.uk/knowledgebase/topics/education_box1.htm |archivedate=2 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 17th century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003&gt;R. Anderson, "The history of Scottish Education pre-1980", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, ''Scottish Education: Post-Devolution'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), {{ISBN|0-7486-1625-X}}, pp. 219–28.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the effects of this extensive network of schools was the growth of the "democratic myth", which in the 19th century created the widespread belief that many a "lad of pairts" had been able to rise up through the system to take high office, and that literacy was much more widespread in Scotland than in neighbouring states, particularly England.&lt;ref name="Anderson2003"/&gt; Historians are now divided over whether the ability of boys who pursued this route to social advancement was any different than that in other comparable nations, because the education in some parish schools was basic and short, and attendance was not compulsory.&lt;ref name=Devine2001p91-100&gt;T. M. Devine. ''The Scottish Nation, 1700–2000'' (London: Penguin Books, 2001). {{ISBN|0-14-100234-4}}, pp. 91–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of what the literacy rate actually was, it is clear that many Scottish students learned a useful form of visual literacy that allowed them to organise and remember information in a superior fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel |url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033/The_Shape_of_Knowledge_Children_and_the_Visual_Culture_of_Literacy_and_Numeracy_Science_in_Context_26_2013_215-245 |title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|journal=Science in Context |year=2013|volume=26|pages=215–45 |doi=10.1017/s0269889713000045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title='The Child Writer: Graphic Literacy and the Scottish Educational System, 1700–1820'|journal=History of Education|date=2016|volume=45|pages=695–718|url=https://www.academia.edu/23569976/The_Child_Writer_Graphic_Literacy_and_the_Scottish_Educational_System_1700_1820_History_of_Education_45_2016_695-718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century, Scotland had five universities, compared with England's two. After the disruption of the [[Wars of the three kingdoms|civil wars]], [[Scotland under the Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] and purges at the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]], they recovered with a lecture-based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high quality liberal education to the sons of the nobility and gentry.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003/&gt; All saw the establishment or re-establishment of chairs of mathematics. Observatories were built at St. Andrews and at King's and Marischal colleges in Aberdeen. [[Robert Sibbald]] (1641–1722) was appointed as the first Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh, and he co-founded the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] in 1681.&lt;ref name=Devine2012p373&gt;T.

Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0-19-162433-0}}, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; These developments helped the universities to become major centres of medical education and would put Scotland at the forefront of new thinking.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003/&gt; By the end of the century, the University of Edinburgh's Medical School was arguably one of the leading centres of science in Europe, boasting such names as the anatomist [[Alexander Monro (secundus)]], the chemists [[William Cullen]] and Joseph Black,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=M D|title=Useful Pictures: Joseph Black and the Graphic Culture of Experimentation|journal=in Robert G.

Attendance was less expensive and the student body more socially representative.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Houston, ''Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600–1800'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-521-89088-8}}, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system.&lt;ref name="HermanTwo"&gt;A. Herman, ''How the Scots Invented the Modern World'' (London: Crown Publishing Group, 2001), {{ISBN|0-609-80999-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual climate===
In France, the Enlightenment was based in the [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] and culminated in the great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–72) edited by [[Denis Diderot]] and (until 1759) [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1713–84) with contributions by hundreds of leading intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] (1712–78) &lt;ref&gt;D. Vallier, ''Rousseau'' (New York: Crown, c1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montesquieu]] (1689–1755). Some 25,000 copies of the 35-volume set were sold, half of them outside France. In Scottish intellectual life the culture was oriented towards books.{{clarify|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. M. Towsey, ''Reading the Scottish Enlightenment: Books and Their Readers in Provincial Scotland, 1750–1820'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1763 Edinburgh had six printing houses and three paper mills; by 1783 there were 16 printing houses and 12 paper mills.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Sher, "Scotland Transformed: The Eighteenth Century", in J. Wormald, ed., ''Scotland: A History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual life revolved around a series of clubs, beginning in Edinburgh in the 1710s. One of the first was the Easy Club, co-founded In Edinburgh by the Jacobite printer [[Thomas Ruddiman]]. Clubs did not reach Glasgow until the 1740s. One of the first and most important in the city was the Political Economy Club, aimed at creating links between academics and merchants,&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p346"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0712698930}}, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; of which noted economist [[Adam Smith]] was a prominent early member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=John Cunningham (ed.) |title=Adam Smith: Critical Assessments vol. 1 |date=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415108942 |page=95 |edition=[Repr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other clubs in Edinburgh included [[The Select Society]], formed by the younger [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], a prominent artist, and philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith&lt;ref name="MacDonald2000p57"&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, [[The Poker Club]], formed in 1762 and named by [[Adam Ferguson]] for the aim to "poke up" opinion on the militia issue.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p348"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0712698930}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Jonathan Israel]] argues that by 1750 Scotland's major cities had created an intellectual infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions, such as universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums and masonic lodges. The Scottish network was "predominantly liberal Calvinist, Newtonian, and 'design' oriented in character which played a major role in the further development of the transatlantic Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="HermanTwo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Israel|first=Jonathan|title=Democratic Enlightenment: Philosophy, Revolution, and Human Rights 1750–1790|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xP4l0ug3rAC&amp;pg=PA233|year=2011|publisher=Oxford UP|page=233|accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Lenman says their "central achievement was a new capacity to recognize and interpret social patterns."&lt;ref&gt;R.

==Major intellectual areas==

===Empiricism and inductive reasoning===
{{Cleanup section|reason=Despite the heading, this section lacks content on inductive reasoning.|date=September 2018}}
The first major philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment was [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] (1694–1746), who was professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. He was an important link between the ideas of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and the later school of [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]], developing [[Utilitarianism]] and [[Consequentialist]] thinking.&lt;ref name="Mitchison1983p.150"/&gt; Also influenced by Shaftesbury was [[George Turnbull (theologian)|George Turnbull]] (1698–1748), who was regent at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and who published pioneering work in the fields of Christian ethics, art and education.&lt;ref&gt;A. Broadie, ''A History of Scottish Philosophy'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0748616276}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Hume]] (1711–76) whose ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature|Treatise on Human Nature]]'' (1738) and ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary|Essays, Moral and Political]]'' (1741) helped outline the parameters of philosophical [[Empiricism]] and [[Scepticism]].&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983p.150&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; He would be a major influence on later Enlightenment figures including [[Adam Smith]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Freydberg, ''David Hume: Platonic Philosopher, Continental Ancestor'' (Suny Press, 2012), {{ISBN|1438442157}}, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume's argument that there were no efficient causes hidden in nature was supported and developed by [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]] (1778–1820), who was [[Dugald Stewart]]'s (1753–1828) successor at Edinburgh and who would be a major influence on later philosophers including [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Graham, ''Scottish Philosophy: Selected Readings 1690–1960'' (Imprint Academic, 2004), {{ISBN|0907845746}}, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Hume, [[Thomas Reid]] (1710–96), a student of Turnbull's, along with minister [[George Campbell (minister)|George Campbell]] (1719–96) and writer and moralist [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]] (1735–1803), formulated [[Common Sense Realism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Emerson, "The contexts of the Scottish Enlightenment" in A. Broadie, ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to the Scottish Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-521-00323-0}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Reid set out his theories in ''An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense'' (1764).&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Wilson, P. H. Reill, ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (Infobase Publishing, 2nd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|0816053359}}, pp. 499–501.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach argued that there are certain concepts, such as human existence, the existence of solid objects and some basic moral "first principles", that are intrinsic to the make up of man and from which all subsequent arguments and systems of morality must be derived. It can be seen as an attempt to reconcile the new scientific developments of the Enlightenment with religious belief.&lt;ref name=Gutjhar2011p39&gt;Paul C. Gutjahr, ''Charles Hodge: Guardian of American Orthodoxy'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199740429}}), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{Main article|Scottish literature in the eighteenth century}}
Major literary figures originating in Scotland in this period included [[James Boswell]] (1740–95), whose ''An Account of Corsica'' (1768) and ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' (1785) drew on his extensive travels and whose ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]'' (1791) is a major source on one of the English Enlightenment's major men of letters and his circle.&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Wilson and P. H. Reill, ''Encyclopedia Of The Enlightenment'' (Infobase, 2nd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|0816053359}}, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]] as a [[poetic form]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyer [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]] (1696–1782) made a major contribution to the study of literature with ''Elements of Criticism'' (1762), which became the standard textbook on rhetoric and style.&lt;ref&gt;J. Friday, ed., ''Art and Enlightenment: Scottish Aesthetics in the Eighteenth Century'' (Imprint Academic, 2004), {{ISBN|0907845762}}, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugh Blair]] (1718–1800) was a minister of the Church of Scotland and held the Chair of Rhetoric and [[Belles Lettres]] at the University of Edinburgh. He produced an edition of the works of [[Shakespeare]] and is best known for ''Sermons'' (1777–1801), a five-volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and Lectures on Rhetoric and ''Belles Lettres'' (1783), an essay on literary composition, which was to have a major impact on the work of Adam Smith. He was also one of the figures who first drew attention to the [[Ossian]] cycle of [[James Macpherson]] to public attention.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. ''Kennedy, Classical Rhetoric and Its Christian and Secular Tradition Form Ancient to Modern Times'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0807861138}}, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Macpherson (1736–96) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard Ossian, he published "translations" that were proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Final'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.&lt;ref&gt;D. Thomson, ''The Gaelic Sources of Macpherson's "Ossian"'' (Aberdeen: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[Robert Burns]] (1759–96) the most important Scottish language poet was [[Robert Fergusson]] (1750–74), who also worked in English. His work often celebrated his native Edinburgh and Enlightenment conviviality, as in his best known poem "Auld Reekie" (1773).&lt;ref name=Carruthers2009pp58-9&gt;G. Carruthers, ''Scottish Literature'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|074863309X}}, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is now widely regarded as the [[national poet]] of Scotland and became a major figure in the Romantic movement. As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected [[Folk music|folk songs]] from across Scotland, often revising or [[Literary adaptation|adapting]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=L.

===Sociology and anthropology===
Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed what leading thinkers such as [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]] (1714–99) and Lord Kames called a ''[[science of man]]'',&lt;ref name="Magnusson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040 |title=Northern lights |author=[[Magnus Magnusson]] |work=[[New Statesman]] |publisher=Review of [[James Buchan]]'s ''Capital of the Mind: Edinburgh (Crowded With Genius: Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind'' in the [[United States]]) [[London]]: [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] {{ISBN|0-7195-5446-2}} |date=10 November 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329124427/http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040 |archivedate=March 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was expressed historically in the work of thinkers such as James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] and John Walker, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behave in ancient and primitive cultures, with an awareness of the determining forces of [[modernity]]. Modern notions of visual anthropology permeated the lectures of leading Scottish academics like Hugh Blair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Line of Reason: Hugh Blair, Spatiality and the Progressive Structure of Language|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|year=2011|volume=65|pages=9–24|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0098}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alan Swingewood argues that modern sociology largely originated in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Swingewood, "Origins of Sociology: the Case of the Scottish Enlightenment," ''The British Journal of Sociology,'' Vol. 21, No. 2 (June, 1970), pp. 164–80 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/588406 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Monboddo is most famous today as a founder of modern comparative historical [[linguistics]].

===Mathematics, science and medicine===
One of the central pillars of the Scottish Enlightenment was scientific and medical knowledge. Many of the key thinkers were trained as physicians or had studied science and medicine at university or on their own at some point in their career. Likewise, there was a notable presence of university medically-trained professionals, especially physicians, apothecaries, surgeons and even ministers, who lived in provincial settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title='The Sparkling Nectar of Spas: The Medical and Commercial Relevance of Mineral Water’, in Ursula Klein and Emma Spary (eds.), Materials and Expertise in Early Modern Europe: Between Market and Laboratory|date=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=198–226|url=https://www.academia.edu/1114266/The_Sparkling_Nectar_of_Spas_The_Medical_and_Commercial_Relevance_of_Mineral_Water_in_Ursula_Klein_and_Emma_Spary_eds._Materials_and_Expertise_in_Early_Modern_Europe_Between_Market_and_Laboratory_Chicago_The_University_of_Chicago_Press_2010_198-226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike England or other European countries like France or Austria, the intelligentsia of Scotland were not beholden to powerful aristocratic patrons and this led them to see science through the eyes of utility, improvement and reform.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Edinburgh became a major centre of medical teaching and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bynum|first1=W. F.|last2=Porter|first2=Roy|title=William Hunter and the Eighteenth-Century Medical World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJc0wTuTGuMC&amp;pg=PA142|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=142–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Edinburgh Medical School rose to prominence by the end of the 18th century. [[Robert Sibbald]] and the establishment of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] in 1680 also played a major role in the development of medicine in Enlightenment Scotland.

==Significance==
Representative of the far-reaching impact of the Scottish Enlightenment was the new ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', which was designed in Edinburgh by [[Colin Macfarquhar]], [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]] and others. It was first published in three volumes between 1768 and 1771, with 2,659 pages and 160 engravings, and quickly became a standard reference work in the English-speaking world. The fourth edition (1810) ran to 16,000 pages in 20 volumes. The ''Encyclopaedia'' continued to be published in Edinburgh until 1898, when it was sold to an American publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Brown|title=The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain and Empire (1707–1918)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BasUT5FyhM8C&amp;pg=PA199|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh U.P.|pages=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural influence===
The Scottish Enlightenment had numerous dimensions, influencing the culture of the nation in several areas including architecture, art and music.&lt;ref&gt;June C. Ottenberg, "Musical Currents of the Scottish Enlightenment," ''International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music'' Vol. 9, No. 1 (Jun., 1978), pp. 99–109 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/836530 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotland produced some of the most significant architects of the period who were involved in the intellectual culture of the Enlightenment. [[Robert Adam]] (1728–92) was an interior designer as well as an architect, with his brothers developing the [[Adam style]],&lt;ref&gt;''Adam Silver'' (HMSO/Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, 1953), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He influenced the development of architecture in Britain, Western Europe, [[Architecture of the United States|North America]] and in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;N.

Watkin, ''The Architect King: George III and the Culture of the Enlightenment'' (Royal Collection Publications, 2004), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

Artists included [[John Alexander (painter)|John Alexander]] and his younger contemporary [[William Mossman]] (1700–71). They painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p56&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading Scottish artist of the late eighteenth century, Allan Ramsay, studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490799/Allan-Ramsay "Allan Ramsey"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1723–98) spent almost his entire career in Italy and emerged as a pioneering neo-classical painter of historical and mythical themes, including his depictions of scenes from Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', as well as acting as an informal tutor to British artists and as an early archaeologist and antiquarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253404/Gavin-Hamilton "Gavin Hamilton"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works can be seen as Enlightenment speculations about the origins of society and politics, including the ''Death of Lucretia'' (1768), an event thought to be critical to the birth of the [[Roman Republic]]. His classicism would be a major influence on French artist [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1748–1825).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp63-5&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 63–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of a musical culture in the capital was marked by the incorporation of the Musical Society of Edinburgh in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Breslaw, ''Doctor Alexander Hamilton and Provincial America'' (Louisiana State University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|0807132780}}, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish composers known to be active in this period include: Alexander Munro (fl. c. 1732), James Foulis (1710–73) and Charles McLean (fl. c. 1737).&lt;ref name="Baxter2001app140-1"&gt;J.

Wilson, ''Edinburgh'' (Lonely Planet, 3rd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|1740593820}}, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-eighteenth century, a group of Scottish composers began to respond to Allan Ramsey's call to "own and refine" their own musical tradition, creating what James Johnson has characterised as the "Scots drawing room style", taking primarily Lowland Scottish tunes and adding simple figured basslines and other features from Italian music that made them acceptable to a middle-class audience. It gained momentum when major Scottish composers like [[James Oswald (composer)|James Oswald]] (1710–69) and [[William McGibbon]] (1690–1756) became involved around 1740. Oswald's ''Curious Collection of Scottish Songs'' (1740) was one of the first to include Gaelic tunes alongside Lowland ones, setting a fashion common by the middle of the century and helping to create a unified Scottish musical identity. However, with changing fashions there was a decline in the publication of collections of specifically Scottish collections of tunes, in favour of their incorporation into British collections.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gelbart, ''The Invention of "Folk Music" and "Art Music"'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), {{ISBN|1139466089}}, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider impact===
While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century,&lt;ref name="Magnusson"/&gt; disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[James Watt]], [[William Murdoch]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] and [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Wills, ''Scottish Firsts: a Celebration of Innovation and Achievement'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2002), {{ISBN|1-84018-611-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the movement spread beyond Scotland across the British Empire, and onto the Continent. The political ideas had an important impact on the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers of the US]], which broke away from the empire in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Walker Howe.

===Cultural representations===
The Scottish dramatist [[Robert McLellan]] (1907-1985) wrote a number of full-length stage comedies which give a self-conscious representation of Edinburgh at the height of the Scottish enlightenment, most notably ''[[The Flouers o Edinburgh]]'' (1957). These plays include references to many of the figures historically associated with the movement and satirise various social tensions, particularly in the field of spoken language, between traditional society and [[anglicisation|anglicised]] Scots who presented themselves as exponents of so-called 'new manners'. Other later examples include ''[[Young Auchinleck]]'' (1962), a stage portrait of the young [[James Boswell]], and ''[[The Hypocrite]]'' (1967) which draws attention to conservative religious reaction in the country that threatened to check enlightenment trends. McLellan's picture of these tensions in [[nation]]al terms is complex, even-handed and multi-faceted.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Donati (ed.), ''Robert McLellan: Playing Scotland's Story, Collected Dramatic Works'' (Edinburgh, Luath Press, 2013), {{ISBN|9781906817534}}.

The Silk Road derives its name from the lucrative trade in [[silk]] carried out along its length, beginning in the [[Han dynasty]] (207 BCE–220 CE). The Han dynasty expanded the [[Central Asia]]n section of the trade routes around 114 BCE through the missions and explorations of the Chinese imperial envoy [[Zhang Qian]].&lt;ref name="boulnois"&gt;{{Cite book|first= Luce |last= Boulnois | author-link = Luce Boulnois | year= 2005|title= Silk Road: Monks, Warriors &amp; Merchants|publisher= Odyssey Books|location= Hong Kong|page= 66|isbn= 962-217-721-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese took great interest in the safety of their trade products and extended the [[Great Wall of China]] to ensure the protection of the trade route.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru, Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2010), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===

====Chinese and Central Asian contacts====
[[Inner Asia|Central Eurasia]] has been known from ancient times for its horse riding and horse breeding communities, and the overland [[Steppe Route]] across the northern steppes of Central Eurasia was in use long before that of the Silk Road.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Archeological sites such as the Berel burial ground in [[Kazakhstan]], confirmed that the nomadic [[Arimaspians]] were not only breeding horses for trade but also great craftsmen able to propagate exquisite art pieces along the Silk Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://astanatimes.com/2012/12/treasures-of-ancient-altai-nomads-revealed/|title=Treasures of Ancient Altai Nomads Revealed|date=2012-12-10|newspaper=The Astana Times|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223211537/http://astanatimes.com/2012/12/treasures-of-ancient-altai-nomads-revealed/|archivedate=2017-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://astanatimes.com/2013/08/additional-berel-burial-sites-excavated/|title=Additional Berel Burial Sites Excavated – The Astana Times|date=2013-08-21|newspaper=The Astana Times|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223213908/http://astanatimes.com/2013/08/additional-berel-burial-sites-excavated/|archivedate=2017-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 2nd millennium BCE, [[nephrite]] [[jade]] was being traded from mines in the region of [[Yarkent County|Yarkand]] and [[Khotan]] to [[China]]. Significantly, these mines were not very far from the [[lapis lazuli]] and [[spinel]] ("Balas Ruby") mines in [[Badakhshan]], and, although separated by the formidable [[Pamir Mountains]], routes across them were apparently in use from very early times.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Some remnants of what was probably Chinese silk dating from 1070 BCE have been found in [[Ancient Egypt]]. The Great Oasis cities of [[Central Asia]] played a crucial role in the effective functioning of the Silk Road trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart|last = Pollard;Rosenberg;Tignor|first = Elizabeth;Clifford;Robert|publisher = Norton|year = 2011|isbn = 9780393918472|location = New York, New York|page = 278}}&lt;/ref&gt; The originating source seems sufficiently reliable, but silk degrades very rapidly, so it cannot be verified whether it was cultivated silk (which almost certainly came from China) or a type of ''[[wild silk]]'', which might have come from the [[Mediterranean]] or [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1038/362025b0|volume = 362|issue = 6415|page = 25|last = Lubec|first = G.|author2=J.

Following contacts between [[Metropolitan regions of China|Metropolitan China]] and nomadic western border territories in the 8th century BCE, gold was introduced from Central Asia, and Chinese jade carvers began to make imitation designs of the steppes, adopting the [[Scythian]]-style [[animal style|animal art]] of the steppes (depictions of animals locked in combat). This style is particularly reflected in the rectangular belt plaques made of gold and bronze, with other versions in jade and [[steatite]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} An elite burial near [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]], dated to the 6th century BCE, was excavated and found to have not only [[bronze sculpture|Greek bronzes]] but also Chinese silks.&lt;ref name="christopoulos 2012 footnote56"&gt;Christopoulos, Lucas (August 2012), "Hellenes and Romans in Ancient China (240 BC – 1398 AD)," in Victor H. Mair (ed), ''Sino-Platonic Papers'', No. 230, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, University of Pennsylvania Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, p. 31 footnote #56, {{ISSN|2157-9687}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar animal-shaped pieces of art and wrestler motifs on belts have been found in [[Scythians|Scythian]] grave sites stretching from the [[Black Sea]] region all the way to [[Warring States]] era archaeological sites in [[Inner Mongolia]] (at Aluchaideng) and [[Shaanxi]] (at [[:de:Keshengzhuang|Keshengzhuang]]) in China.&lt;ref name="christopoulos 2012 footnote56"/&gt;

The expansion of Scythian cultures, stretching from the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian plain]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]] to the Chinese [[Kansu]] Corridor, and linking the Middle East with Northern India and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], undoubtedly played an important role in the development of the Silk Road. Scythians accompanied the [[Assyria]]n [[Esarhaddon]] on his invasion of [[Egypt]], and their distinctive triangular arrowheads have been found as far south as [[Aswan]]. These nomadic peoples were dependent upon neighbouring settled populations for a number of important technologies, and in addition to raiding vulnerable settlements for these commodities, they also encouraged long-distance merchants as a source of income through the enforced payment of tariffs. [[Sogdia]]ns played a major role in facilitating trade between China and Central Asia along the Silk Roads as late as the 10th century, their language serving as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' for Asian trade as far back as the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hanks, Reuel R. (2010), ''Global Security Watch: Central Asia'', Santa Barbara, Denver, Oxford: Praeger, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark J.

====Persian Royal Road====
[[File:Map achaemenid empire en.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Achaemenid Persian Empire]] at its greatest extent, showing the [[Royal Road]].]]

By the time of [[Herodotus]] (c. 475 BCE), the [[Royal Road]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] ran some {{convert|2857|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city of [[Susa]] on the [[Karun]] ({{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the [[Tigris]]) to the port of [[Smyrna]] (modern [[İzmir]] in [[Turkey]]) on the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Please refer to [[Royal Road]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was maintained and protected by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (c. 500–330 BCE) and had postal stations and relays at regular intervals. By having fresh horses and riders ready at each relay, royal couriers could carry messages and traverse the length of the road in nine days, while normal travellers took about three months.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

====Hellenistic era====
[[File:UrumqiWarrior.jpg|thumb|upright|Probable [[Greco-Bactrian kingdom|Greek soldier]] with a Greek mythological [[centaur]] in the [[Sampul tapestry]],&lt;ref&gt;Christopoulos, Lucas (August 2012), "Hellenes and Romans in Ancient China (240 BC – 1398 AD)," in Victor H.

The next major step in the development of the Silk Road was the expansion of the [[Classical Greece|Greek]] empire of [[Alexander the Great]] into [[Central Asia]]. In August 329 BC, at the mouth of the [[Fergana Valley]] in [[Tajikistan]], he founded the city of [[Alexandria Eschate]] or "Alexandria The Furthest".&lt;ref&gt;Prevas, John. (2004). ''Envy of the Gods: Alexander the Great's Ill-Fated Journey across Asia'', p. 121. De Capo Press, Cambridge, Mass. {{ISBN|0-306-81268-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Greeks]] remained in Central Asia for the next three centuries, first through the administration of the [[Seleucid Empire]], and then with the establishment of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] (250–125 BCE) in [[Bactria]] (modern [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Pakistan]]) and the later [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180 BCE – 10 CE) in modern [[North Pakistan|Northern Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. They continued to expand eastward, especially during the reign of [[Euthydemus I|Euthydemus]] (230–200 BCE), who extended his control beyond Alexandria Eschate to [[Sogdiana]]. There are indications that he may have led expeditions as far as [[Kashgar]] in [[Chinese Turkestan]], leading to the first known contacts between China and the West around 200 BCE. The Greek historian [[Strabo]] writes, ''"they extended their empire even as far as the [[Seres]] (China) and the Phryni."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+11.11.1|title=Strabo XI.XI.I|publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Mediterranean linked to the [[Fergana Valley]], the next step was to open a route across the [[Tarim Basin]] and the [[Hexi Corridor]] to [[China Proper]]. This extension came around 130 BCE, with the embassies of the Han dynasty to Central Asia following the reports of the ambassador [[Zhang Qian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Megalithic Portal|author2=Megalith Map|lastauthoramp=yes|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006|title=''Silk Road, North China'', C.M.

Others&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo,'Ancient China and its Enemies', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; say that Emperor Wu was mainly interested in [[Han–Xiongnu War|fighting the Xiongnu]] and that major trade began only after the Chinese pacified the [[Hexi Corridor]].

The Silk Roads' origin lay in the hands of the Chinese. The soil in China lacked Selenium, a deficiency which contributed to muscular weakness and reduced growth in horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Selenium in the Environment|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=|editor-last=Frankenberger|editor-first=W.T.|location=|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, horses in China were too frail to support the weight of a Chinese soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City of Heavenly Tranquility: Beijing in the History of China|last=Becker|first=Jasper|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese needed the superior horses that nomads bred on the Eurasian steppes, and nomads wanted things only agricultural societies produced, such as grain and silk. Even after the construction of the Great Wall, nomads gathered at the gates of the wall to exchange. Soldiers sent to guard the wall were often paid in silk which they traded with the nomads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silk Roads: A Brief History with Documents|last=Liu|first=Xinru|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past its inception, the Chinese continued to dominate the Silk Roads, a process which was accelerated when "China snatched control of the Silk Road from the [[Xiongnu|Hsiung-nu]]" and the Chinese general Cheng Ki "installed himself as protector of the [[Tarim Basin|Tarim]] at Wu-lei, situated between [[Karasahr|Kara Shahr]] and [[Kucha]]."  "China's control of the Silk Road at the time of the [[Han dynasty|later Han]], by ensuring the freedom of transcontinental trade along the double chain of oases north and south of the Tarim, favoured the dissemination of Buddhism in the river basin, and with it Indian literature and Hellenistic art."&lt;ref name=Rene&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=36–37, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese were also strongly attracted by the tall and powerful horses (named "Heavenly horses") in the possession of the Dayuan (literally the "Great Ionians", the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greek kingdoms of Central Asia]]), which were of capital importance in fighting the nomadic Xiongnu. The Chinese subsequently sent numerous embassies, around ten every year, to these countries and as far as [[Seleucid]] Syria. "Thus more embassies were dispatched to Anxi [Parthia], Yancai [who later joined the [[Alans]] ], Lijian [Syria under the Greek Seleucids], Tiaozhi ([[Mesopotamia]]), and [[Tenjiku|Tianzhu]] [northwestern India]... As a rule, rather more than ten such missions went forward in the course of a year, and at the least five or six." (''Hou Hanshu'', Later Han History).These connections marked the beginning of the Silk Road trade network that extended to the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Ebrey"&gt;Ebrey (1999), 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chinese campaigned in Central Asia on several occasions, and direct encounters between Han troops and Roman legionaries (probably captured or recruited as mercenaries by the Xiong Nu) are recorded, particularly in the 36 BCE battle of [[Sogdiana]] (Joseph Needham, Sidney Shapiro). It has been suggested that the Chinese [[crossbow]] was transmitted to the Roman world on such occasions, although the Greek [[gastraphetes]] provides an alternative origin. R. Ernest Dupuy and Trevor N. Dupuy suggest that in 36 BCE, a "Han expedition into central Asia, west of Jaxartes River, apparently encountered and defeated a contingent of Roman legionaries. The Romans may have been part of [[Mark Antony|Antony]]'s army invading [[Parthia]]. Sogdiana (modern [[Bukhara]]), east of the Oxus River, on the [[Polytimetus]] River, was apparently the most easterly penetration ever made by Roman forces in Asia. The margin of Chinese victory appears to have been their crossbows, whose bolts and darts seem easily to have penetrated Roman shields and armour."&lt;ref&gt;R. Ernest Dupuy and Trevor N. Dupuy, ''The Harper Encyclopedia of Military History from 3500 B.C. to the Present'', Fourth Edition (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1993), 133, apparently relying on Homer H. Dubs, "A Roman City in Ancient China", in ''Greece and Rome'', Second Series, Vol. 4, No. 2 (Oct., 1957), pp. 139–48&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman historian [[Florus]] also describes the visit of numerous envoys, which included ''[[Seres]]''(China), to the first Roman Emperor [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]], who reigned between 27 BCE and 14 CE:

{{Quotation|Even the rest of the nations of the world which were not subject to the imperial sway were sensible of its grandeur, and looked with reverence to the Roman people, the great conqueror of nations. Thus even Scythians and [[Sarmatians]] sent envoys to seek the friendship of Rome. Nay, the Seres came likewise, and the Indians who dwelt beneath the vertical sun, bringing presents of precious stones and pearls and elephants, but thinking all of less moment than the vastness of the journey which they had undertaken, and which they said had occupied four years. In truth it needed but to look at their complexion to see that they were people of another world than ours.|[[Henry Yule]]|''Cathay and the Way Thither'' (1866)|}}

The Han army regularly policed the trade route against nomadic bandit forces generally identified as Xiongnu. Han general [[Ban Chao]] led an army of 70,000 [[mounted infantry]] and [[light cavalry]] troops in the 1st century CE to secure the [[trade]] routes, reaching far west to the Tarim basin. Ban Chao expanded his conquests across the [[Pamirs]] to the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]] and the borders of Parthia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/440601/Ban-Chao Ban Chao] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616061740/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/440601/Ban-Chao |date=2009-06-16 }}, Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; It was from here that the Han general dispatched envoy [[Gan Ying]] to [[Daqin]] (Rome).&lt;ref&gt;Frances Wood, ''The Silk Road: Two Thousand Years in the Heart of Asia'', University of California Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0520243404}}, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The Silk Road essentially came into being from the 1st century BCE, following these efforts by China to consolidate a road to the Western world and [[India]], both through direct settlements in the area of the Tarim Basin and diplomatic relations with the countries of the Dayuan, Parthians and Bactrians further west. The Silk Roads were a "complex network of trade routes" that gave people the chance to exchange goods and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry H. Bentley]], ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

A maritime Silk Route opened up between Chinese-controlled [[Giao Chỉ]] (centred in modern [[Vietnam]], near [[Hanoi]]), probably by the 1st century. It extended, [[Indo-Roman trade relations|via ports on the coasts of India]] and [[Sri Lanka]], all the way to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-controlled ports in [[Roman Egypt]] and the [[Nabataean]] territories on the northeastern coast of the [[Red Sea]]. The earliest [[Roman glassware]] bowl found in China was unearthed from a Western Han tomb in [[Guangzhou]], dated to the early 1st century BCE, indicating that Roman commercial items were being imported through the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref name="an 2002 p83"&gt;An, Jiayao.

===Roman Empire===
[[File:Seidenstrasse GMT Ausschnitt Zentralasien.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asia during Roman times, with the first Silk Road]]

Soon after the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE, regular communications and trade between China, [[Southeast Asia]], India, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe blossomed on an unprecedented scale. The Roman Empire inherited eastern trade routes that were part of the Silk Road from the earlier Hellenistic powers and the Arabs. With control of these trade routes, citizens of the Roman Empire received new luxuries and greater prosperity for the Empire as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman-style glassware discovered in the archeological sites of [[Gyeongju]], capital of the [[Silla|Silla kingdom]] (Korea) showed that Roman artifacts were traded as far as the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Greco-[[Roman trade with India]] started by [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] in 130 BCE continued to increase, and according to [[Strabo]] (II.5.12), by the time of [[Augustus]], up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from [[Myos Hormos]] in Roman Egypt to India.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html Strabo's Geography Book II Chapter 5 ]"&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Empire connected with the Central Asian Silk Road through their ports in Barygaza (known today as Bharuch &lt;ref&gt;[[Bharuch]], Bharuch website, retrieved on 19 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;) and Barbaricum (known today as the cities of Karachi, Sindh, and Pakistan &lt;ref&gt;Barbarikon Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan website, retrieved on 19 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;) and continued along the western coast of India.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; An ancient "travel guide" to this Indian Ocean trade route was the Greek [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] written in 60 CE.

The travelling party of [[Maes Titianus|Maës Titianus]] penetrated farthest east along the Silk Road from the Mediterranean world, probably with the aim of regularising contacts and reducing the role of middlemen, during one of the lulls in Rome's intermittent wars with [[Parthia]], which repeatedly obstructed movement along the Silk Road. Intercontinental trade and communication became regular, organised, and protected by the 'Great Powers.' Intense [[Roman commerce|trade with the Roman Empire]] soon followed, confirmed by the Roman craze for Chinese silk (supplied through the Parthians), even though the Romans thought silk was obtained from trees. This belief was affirmed by [[Seneca the Younger]] in his [[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]] and by [[Virgil]] in his [[Georgics]]. Notably, [[Pliny the Elder]] knew better. Speaking of the ''bombyx'' or silk moth, he wrote in his [[Natural Histories]] "They weave webs, like spiders, that become a luxurious clothing material for women, called silk."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural Histories'' 11.xxvi.76&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans traded spices, glassware, perfumes, and silk.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru, Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cernuschi Museum 20060812 150.jpg|thumb|A Westerner on a camel, [[Northern Wei dynasty]] (386–534)]]

Roman artisans began to replace yarn with valuable plain silk cloths from China and the [[Silla|Silla Kingdom]] in [[Gyeongju]], Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, The Silk Road in World History (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Chinese wealth grew as they delivered silk and other luxury goods to the Roman Empire, whose wealthy women admired their beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru, Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Senate issued, in vain, several edicts to prohibit the wearing of silk, on economic and moral grounds: the import of Chinese silk caused a huge outflow of gold, and silk clothes were considered decadent and immoral.
{{quote|I can see clothes of silk, if materials that do not hide the body, nor even one's decency, can be called clothes... Wretched flocks of maids labour so that the adulteress may be visible through her thin dress, so that her husband has no more acquaintance than any outsider or foreigner with his wife's body.&lt;ref&gt;Seneca the Younger (c. 3 BCE – 65 CE), Declamations Vol. I&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The West Roman Empire, and its demand for sophisticated Asian products, crumbled in the West around the 5th century.

The unification of Central Asia and Northern India within the [[Kushan Empire]] in the 1st to 3rd centuries reinforced the role of the powerful merchants from Bactria and [[Taxila]].&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;Sogdian Trade, ''Encyclopedia Iranica'', (retrieved 15 June 2007) &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sogdian-trade |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117050947/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sogdian-trade |archivedate=2011-11-17 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They fostered multi-cultural interaction as indicated by their 2nd century treasure hoards filled with products from the Greco-Roman world, China, and India, such as in the [[Bagram|archeological site of Begram]].

===Byzantine Empire===
{{further|Byzantine-Mongol alliance}}

[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Greek historian [[Procopius]] stated that two [[Nestorian Christianity|Nestorian Christian]] monks eventually uncovered the way silk was made. From this revelation, monks were sent by the Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian]] (ruled 527–565) as spies on the Silk Road from [[Constantinople]] to China and back to [[Smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire|steal the silkworm eggs]], resulting in silk production in the Mediterranean, particularly in [[Soufli#Silk museums of Soufli|Thrace]] in northern Greece,&lt;ref name="livius.org"&gt;[http://www.livius.org/sh-si/silk_road/silk_road.html "Silk Road"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906212218/http://www.livius.org/sh-si/silk_road/silk_road.html |date=2013-09-06 }}, LIVIUS Articles of Ancient History. 28 October 2010.

In 568 the Byzantine ruler [[Justin II]] was greeted by a [[Sogdia]]n embassy representing [[Istämi]], ruler of the [[Turkic Khaganate]], who formed an alliance with the Byzantines against [[Khosrow I]] of the [[Sasanian Empire]] that allowed the Byzantines to bypass the Sasanian merchants and trade directly with the Sogdians for purchasing Chinese silk.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Michael C.

Although the Silk Road was initially formulated during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (141–87 BCE), it was reopened by the [[Tang Empire]] in 639 when [[Hou Junji]] conquered the [[Western Regions]], and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during [[Empress Wu]]'s period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the [[Four Garrisons of Anxi]] originally installed in 640,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Nishijima|first=Sadao|editor1-last=Twitchett|editor1-first=Denis|editor2-last=Loewe|editor2-first=Michael|chapter=The Economic and Social History of Former Han|title=Cambridge History of China: Volume I: the Ch'in and Han Empires, 221 B.C. – A.D. 220|year=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-24327-0|pages=545–607}}&lt;/ref&gt; once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Eberhard|first=Wolfram|title=A History of China|year=2005|publisher=Cosimo|location=New York|isbn=1-59605-566-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tang captured the vital route through the [[Gilgit|Gilgit Valley]] from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General [[Gao Xianzhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Whitfield|first=Susan|title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith|year=2004|publisher=Serindia|location=Chicago|isbn=1-932476-12-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Turks were settled in the Ordos region (former territory of the [[Xiongnu]]), the Tang government took on the military policy of dominating the central steppe.

The Tang dynasty established a second [[Pax Sinica]], and the Silk Road reached its golden age, whereby Persian and Sogdian merchants benefited from the commerce between East and West. At the same time, the Chinese empire welcomed foreign cultures, making it very cosmopolitan in its urban centres. In addition to the land route, the Tang dynasty also developed the maritime Silk Route. Chinese envoys had been sailing through the Indian Ocean to [[Kanchipuram|India]] since perhaps the 2nd century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sun|first=Guangqi|title=History of Navigation in Ancient China|year=1989|publisher=Ocean Press|location=Beijing|isbn=7-5027-0532-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet it was during the Tang dynasty that a strong Chinese maritime presence could be found in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Red Sea]] into [[Persia]], [[Mesopotamia]] (sailing up the [[Euphrates|Euphrates River]] in modern-day [[Iraq]]), [[Arabia]], Egypt, [[Aksum]] ([[Ethiopia]]), and [[Somalia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bowman|first=John S.|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Silk Road represents an early phenomenon of political and cultural integration due to inter-regional trade. In its heyday, it sustained an international culture that strung together groups as diverse as the [[Magyars]], [[Armenians]], and Chinese. The Silk Road reached its peak in the west during the time of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; in the Nile-[[Oxus]] section, from the [[Sassanid Empire]] period to the [[Il Khanate]] period; and in the [[sinitic]] zone from the [[Three Kingdoms]] period to the [[Yuan dynasty]] period. Trade between East and West also developed across the [[Indian Ocean]], between Alexandria in Egypt and [[Guangzhou]] in China. Persian Sassanid coins emerged as a means of currency, just as valuable as silk yarn and textiles.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, The Silk Road in World History (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under its strong integrating dynamics on the one hand and the impacts of change it transmitted on the other, tribal societies previously living in isolation along the Silk Road, and pastoralists who were of barbarian cultural development, were drawn to the riches and opportunities of the civilisations connected by the routes, taking on the trades of marauders or mercenaries.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} "Many barbarian tribes became skilled warriors able to conquer rich cities and fertile lands and to forge strong military empires."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0CGQBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184|title=Aidan of Lindisfarne: Irish Flame Warms a New World|last=Simpson|first=Ray|date=2014-07-09|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-62564-762-7|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227164624/https://books.google.com/books?id=0CGQBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184|archivedate=2018-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sogdiana|Sogdians]] dominated the East-West trade after the 4th century up to the 8th century, with [[Suyab]] and [[Taraz|Talas]] ranking among their main centres in the north. They were the main caravan merchants of Central Asia. Their commercial interests were protected by the resurgent military power of the [[Göktürks]], whose empire has been described as "the joint enterprise of the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan and the Soghdians".&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wink, André. Al-Hind: The Making of the Indo-Islamic World. Brill Academic Publishers, 2002. {{ISBN|0-391-04173-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A.V. Dybo noted that "according to historians, the main driving force of the Great Silk Road were not just Sogdians, but the carriers of a mixed Sogdian-Türkic culture that often came from mixed families."&lt;ref&gt;Dybo A.V., ''"Chronology of Türkic languages and linguistic contacts of early Türks"'', Moskow, 2007, p. 786, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050311224856/http://altaica.narod.ru/LIBRARY/xronol_tu.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Their trade, with some interruptions, continued in the 9th century within the framework of the [[Uighur Empire]], which until 840 extended across northern Central Asia and obtained from China enormous deliveries of silk in exchange for horses. At this time caravans of Sogdians travelling to Upper Mongolia are mentioned in Chinese sources. They played an equally important religious and cultural role. Part of the data about eastern Asia provided by Muslim geographers of the 10th century actually goes back to Sogdian data of the period 750–840 and thus shows the survival of links between east and west. However, after the end of the Uighur Empire, Sogdian trade went through a crisis. What mainly issued from Muslim Central Asia was the trade of the [[Samanids]], which resumed the northwestern road leading to the Khazars and the Urals and the northeastern one toward the nearby Turkic tribes.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

The Silk Road gave rise to the clusters of military states of nomadic origins in North China, ushered the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]], [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], and later [[Islam]]ic religions into Central Asia and China.

===Islamic era and the Silk Road===

By the [[Umayyad]] era, [[Damascus]] had overtaken [[Ctesiphon]] as a major trade center until the [[Abbasid dynasty]] built the city of [[Baghdad]], which became the most important [[Cities along the Silk Road|city along the silk road]].

At the end of its glory, the routes brought about the largest continental empire ever, the [[Mongol Empire]], with its political centres strung along the Silk Road ([[Beijing]] in North China, [[Karakorum (palace)|Karakorum]] in central Mongolia, [[Sarmakhand]] in [[Transoxiana]], [[Tabriz]] in Northern Iran, [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]] and [[Astrakhan]] in lower [[Volga]], [[Solkhat]] in [[Crimea]], [[Kazan]] in Central Russia, [[Erzurum]] in eastern [[Anatolia]]), realising the political unification of zones previously loosely and intermittently connected by material and cultural goods.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The [[Islamic world]] was [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana|expanded into Central Asia]] during the 8th century, under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], while its successor the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] put a halt to [[Protectorate General to Pacify the West|Chinese westward expansion]] at the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751 (near the [[Talas River]] in modern-day [[Kyrgyzstan]]).&lt;ref name="hanks 2010 p4"&gt;Hanks, Reuel R.

(2010), ''Global Security Watch: Central Asia, Santa Barbara'', Denver, Oxford: Praeger, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 13th century [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia|Khwarezmia was invaded]] by the early [[Mongol Empire]]. The Mongol ruler [[Genghis Khan]] had the once vibrant cities of Bukhara and [[Samarkand]] burned to the ground after besieging them.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Ibbotson and Max Lovell-Hoare (2016), ''Uzbekistan'', 2nd edition, Bradt Travel Guides Ltd, pp. 12–13, {{ISBN|978-1-78477-017-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1370 Samarkand saw a revival as the capital of the new [[Timurid Empire]]. The Turko-Mongol ruler [[Timur]] forcefully moved artisans and intellectuals from across Asia to Samarkand, making it one of the most important trade centers and cultural ''[[entrepôt]]s'' of the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Ibbotson and Max Lovell-Hoare (2016), ''Uzbekistan'', 2nd edition, Bradt Travel Guides Ltd, pp. 14–15, {{ISBN|978-1-78477-017-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mongol age===

[[File:Travels of Marco Polo.svg|thumb|left|Map of [[Marco Polo]]'s travels in 1271–1295]]

The [[Mongol invasions|Mongol expansion]] throughout the Asian continent from around 1207 to 1360 helped bring political stability and re-established the Silk Road (via [[Karakorum (palace)|Karakorum]]). It also brought an end to the dominance of the Islamic Caliphate over world trade. Because the Mongols came to control the trade routes, trade circulated throughout the region, though they never abandoned their nomadic lifestyle.

The Mongol rulers wanted to establish their capital on the Central Asian steppe, so to accomplish this goal, after every conquest they enlisted local people (traders, scholars, artisans) to help them construct and manage their empire.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongol diplomat [[Rabban Bar Sauma]] visited the courts of Europe in 1287–88 and provided a detailed written report to the Mongols. Around the same time, the [[Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Marco Polo]] became one of the first Europeans to travel the Silk Road to China. His tales, documented in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'', opened Western eyes to some of the customs of the [[Far East]]. He was not the first to bring back stories, but he was one of the most widely read. He had been preceded by numerous Christian missionaries to the East, such as [[William of Rubruck]], [[Benedykt Polak]], [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], and [[Andrew of Longjumeau]]. Later envoys included [[Odoric of Pordenone]], [[Giovanni de' Marignolli]], [[John of Montecorvino]], [[Niccolò de' Conti]], and [[Ibn Battuta]], a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[Muslim]] traveller who passed through the present-day Middle East and across the Silk Road from [[Tabriz]] between 1325–54.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/paxmongolica.shtml The Pax Mongolica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990505194222/http://www.silk-road.com/artl/paxmongolica.shtml |date=1999-05-05 }}, by Daniel C. Waugh, University of Washington, Seattle&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century efforts were made at forming a [[Franco-Mongol alliance]], with an exchange of ambassadors and (failed) attempts at military collaboration in the [[Holy Land]] during the later [[Crusades]].  Eventually the Mongols in the [[Ilkhanate]], after they had destroyed the [[Abbasid]] and [[Ayyubid]] dynasties, converted to Islam and signed the 1323 [[Treaty of Aleppo]] with the surviving Muslim power, the Egyptian [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Some studies indicate that the [[Black Death]], which devastated Europe starting in the late 1340s, may have reached Europe from Central Asia (or China) along the trade routes of the Mongol Empire.&lt;ref&gt;J.

The fragmentation of the Mongol Empire loosened the political, cultural, and economic unity of the Silk Road. [[Turkmeni]] marching lords seized land around the western part of the Silk Road from the decaying Byzantine Empire. After the fall of the Mongol Empire, the great political powers along the Silk Road became economically and culturally separated. Accompanying the crystallisation of regional states was the decline of nomad power, partly due to the devastation of the Black Death and partly due to the encroachment of sedentary civilisations equipped with [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://festival.si.edu/2002/the-silk-road/the-silk-road-connecting-peoples-and-cultures/smithsonian |title=THE SILK ROAD: CONNECTING PEOPLE AND CULTURES |last=Kurin |first=Richard |date= |website= |publisher=Festival |access-date=2 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consolidation of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Safavid]] empires in the West Asia led to a revival of overland trade, interrupted sporadically by warfare between them. The silk trade continued to flourish until it was disrupted by the collapse of the Safavid Empire in the 1720s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya |editor-last=İnalcık |editor-first=Halil |editor2=Donald Quataert |title=An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, 1300–1914 |volume=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1994 |pages=505–07, 524 |chapter=Crisis and Change, 1590–1699 |isbn=0-521-57455-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Routes==
{{details|Cities along the Silk Road}}
The Silk Road consisted of several routes. As it extended westwards from the ancient commercial centres of China, the overland, intercontinental Silk Road divided into northern and [[Southern Silk Road: Through Khotan|southern routes]] bypassing the [[Taklamakan Desert]] and [[Lop Nur]]. Merchants along these routes where involved in "relay trade" in which goods changed "hands many times before reaching their final destinations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ways of the World: A Global History|last=Strayer|first=Robert W.|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern route===
{{Main article|Northern Silk Road}}
[[File:Silk Road in the I century AD - en.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Silk]] Road in the 1st century]]
[[File:SeidenstrasseGMT.JPG|upright=1.35|thumb|The Silk Road]]

The northern route started at [[Chang'an]] (now called [[Xi'an]]), an ancient capital of China that was moved further east during the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Later Han]] to [[Luoyang]]. The route was defined around the 1st century BCE when [[Han Wudi]] put an end to harassment by nomadic tribes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The northern route travelled northwest through the Chinese province of [[Gansu]] from [[Shaanxi]] Province and split into three further routes, two of them following the mountain ranges to the north and south of the [[Taklamakan Desert]] to rejoin at [[Kashgar]], and the other going north of the [[Tian Shan]] mountains through [[Turpan]], [[Talgar]], and [[Almaty]] (in what is now southeast [[Kazakhstan]]). The routes split again west of Kashgar, with a southern branch heading down the Alai Valley towards [[Termez]] (in modern Uzbekistan) and [[Balkh]] (Afghanistan), while the other travelled through [[Kokand]] in the [[Fergana Valley]] (in present-day eastern Uzbekistan) and then west across the [[Karakum Desert]]. Both routes joined the main southern route before reaching ancient [[Merv]], Turkmenistan. Another branch of the northern route turned northwest past the [[Aral Sea]] and north of the [[Caspian Sea]], then and on to the [[Black Sea]].

A route for caravans, the northern Silk Road brought to China many goods such as "dates, saffron powder and pistachio nuts from Persia; [[frankincense]], aloes and [[myrrh]] from [[Somalia]]; sandalwood from India; glass bottles from Egypt, and other expensive and desirable goods from other parts of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Ulric Killion, ''A Modern Chinese Journey to the West: Economic Globalisation And Dualism'', (Nova Science Publishers: 2006), p.66&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange, the caravans sent back bolts of silk brocade, lacquer-ware, and porcelain.

===Southern route===
The southern route or Karakoram route was mainly a single route from China through the [[Karakoram|Karakoram mountains]], where it persists in modern times as the [[Karakoram Highway]], a paved road that connects Pakistan and China.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} It then set off westwards, but with southward spurs so travelers could complete the journey by sea from various points. Crossing the high mountains, it passed through northern Pakistan, over the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains, and into Afghanistan, rejoining the northern route near Merv, Turkmenistan. From Merv, it followed a nearly straight line west through mountainous northern [[Iran]], [[Mesopotamia]], and the northern tip of the [[Syrian Desert]] to the [[Levant]], where [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] trading ships plied regular routes to [[Italy]], while land routes went either north through [[Anatolia]] or south to [[North Africa]]. Another branch road travelled from [[Herat]] through [[Susa]] to [[Charax Spasinu]] at the head of the Persian Gulf and across to [[Petra]] and on to [[Alexandria]] and other eastern Mediterranean ports from where ships carried the cargoes to Rome.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Southwestern route===

The southwestern route is believed to be the [[Ganges]]/[[Brahmaputra]] Delta, which has been the subject of international interest for over two millennia. Strabo, the 1st-century Roman writer, mentions the deltaic lands: "Regarding merchants who now sail from Egypt...as far as the Ganges, they are only private citizens..." His comments are interesting as Roman beads and other materials are being found at [[Wari-Bateshwar ruins]], the ancient city with roots from much earlier, before the [[Bronze Age]], presently being slowly excavated beside the Old Brahmaputra in [[Bangladesh]]. Ptolemy's map of the [[Ganges Delta]], a remarkably accurate effort, showed that his informants knew all about the course of the Brahmaputra River, crossing through the [[Himalayas]] then bending westward to its source in [[Tibet]]. It is doubtless that this delta was a major international trading center, almost certainly from much earlier than the Common Era. [[Gemstones]] and other merchandise from [[Thailand]] and [[Java]] were traded in the delta and through it. Chinese archaeological writer Bin Yang and some earlier writers and archaeologists, such as Janice Stargardt, strongly suggest this route of international trade as [[Sichuan]]-[[Yunnan]]-[[Burma]]-[[Bangladesh]] route. According to Bin Yang, especially from the 12th century the route was used to ship bullion from Yunnan (gold and silver are among the minerals in which Yunnan is rich), through northern Burma, into modern Bangladesh, making use of the ancient route, known as the 'Ledo' route. The emerging evidence of the ancient cities of Bangladesh, in particular [[Wari-Bateshwar ruins]], [[Mahasthangarh]], [[Bhitagarh]], [[Bikrampur]], Egarasindhur, and [[Sonargaon]], are believed to be the international trade centers in this route.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, Bin.

===Maritime route===
{{main|Maritime Silk Road}}
Maritime Silk Road or Maritime Silk Route refer to the [[wikt:maritime|maritime]] section of historic Silk Road that connects [[China]] to [[Southeast Asia]], [[Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]], [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Arabian peninsula]], all the way to [[Egypt]] and finally [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Maritime Silk Road| work = SEAArch| url =https://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/tag/maritime-silk-route/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140105043328/http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/tag/maritime-silk-route/| archivedate = 2014-01-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade route encompassed numbers of bodies of waters; including [[South China Sea]], [[Strait of Malacca]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Gulf of Bengal]], [[Arabian Sea]], [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Red Sea]]. The maritime route overlaps with historic Southeast Asian maritime trade, [[Spice trade]], [[Indian Ocean trade]] and after 8th century&amp;nbsp;– the Arabian naval trade network. The network also extend eastward to [[East China Sea]] and [[Yellow Sea]] to connect China with [[Korean Peninsula]] and [[Japanese archipelago]].

==Cultural exchanges==
[[File:Nestorian-Stele-Budge-plate-X.jpg|thumb|The [[Nestorian Stele]], created in 781, describes the introduction of Nestorian Christianity to China]]

[[Richard Foltz]], [[Xinru Liu]], and others have described how trading activities along the Silk Road over many centuries facilitated the transmission not just of goods but also ideas and culture, notably in the area of religions. [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Judaism]], Buddhism, Christianity, Manichaeism, and Islam all spread across Eurasia through trade networks that were tied to specific religious communities and their institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-230-62125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, established Buddhist monasteries along the Silk Road offered a haven, as well as a new religion for foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, The Silk Road in World History (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of religions and cultural traditions along the Silk Roads, according to [[Jerry H. Bentley]], also led to [[syncretism]]. One example was the encounter with the Chinese and [[Xiongnu]] nomads. These unlikely events of cross-cultural contact allowed both cultures to adapt to each other as an alternative. The Xiongnu adopted Chinese agricultural techniques, dress style, and lifestyle, while the Chinese adopted Xiongnu military techniques, some dress style, music, and dance.&lt;ref name="Jerry H 1993"&gt;[[Jerry H. Bentley]], ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps most surprising of the cultural exchanges between China and the Xiongnu, Chinese soldiers sometimes defected and converted to the Xiongnu way of life, and stayed in the steppes for fear of punishment.&lt;ref name="Jerry H 1993"/&gt;

Nomadic mobility played a key role in facilitating inter-regional contacts and cultural exchanges along the ancient Silk Roads.&lt;ref name="hermes_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hermes|first1=Taylor R.|last2=Frachetti|first2=Michael D.|last3=Bullion|first3=Elissa A.|last4=Maksudov|first4=Farhod|last5=Mustafokulov|first5=Samariddin|last6=Makarewicz|first6=Cheryl A.|title=Urban and nomadic isotopic niches reveal dietary connectivities along Central Asia’s Silk Roads|journal=Scientific Reports|date=26 March 2018|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-22995-2|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22995-2|accessdate=1 May 2018|language=En|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.5177H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frachetti_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frachetti|first1=Michael D.|last2=Smith|first2=C.

===Transmission of Christianity===
{{Further information|Nestorian Christianity|Church of the East}}
The transmission of Christianity was primarily known as Nestorianism on the Silk Road. In 781, an inscribed stele shows Nestorian Christian missionaries arriving on the Silk Road. Christianity had spread both east and west, simultaneously bringing Syriac language and evolving the forms of worship.&lt;ref&gt;"Belief Systems Along the Silk Road," Asia Society website, {{cite web |url=http://asiasociety.org/education/belief-systems-along-silk-road |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117221241/http://asiasociety.org/education/belief-systems-along-silk-road |archivedate=2016-11-17 |df= }}, retrieved on November 14, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transmission of Buddhism to China via the Silk Road began in the 1st century CE, according to a semi-legendary account of an ambassador sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han|Ming]] (58–75). During this period Buddhism began to spread throughout Southeast, East, and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry H. Bentley]], ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 69,73.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahayana, Theravada, and Tibetan Buddhism are the three primary forms of Buddhism that spread across Asia via the Silk Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=James A. |date=2009 |title=China's Southwestern Silk Road in World History |url=http://worldhistoryconnected.press.illinois.edu/6.1/anderson.html |journal=World History Connected |volume=6 |issue=1 |access-date=2 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209152743/http://worldhistoryconnected.press.illinois.edu/6.1/anderson.html |archivedate=9 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddhist movement was the first large-scale missionary movement in the history of world religions. Chinese missionaries were able to assimilate Buddhism, to an extent, to native Chinese Daoists, which brought the two beliefs together.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha's community of followers, the [[Sangha]], consisted of male and female monks and laity. These people moved through India and beyond to spread the ideas of Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foltz|first=Richard C.|title=Religions of the Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Exchange from Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century|year=1999|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of members within the Sangha increased, it became costly so that only the larger cities were able to afford having the Buddha and his disciples visit.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, "The Silk Road in World History" (New york: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that under the control of the [[Kushan]]s, Buddhism was spread to China and other parts of Asia from the middle of the first century to the middle of the third century.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, "The Silk Road in World History" (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive contacts started in the 2nd century, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the Kushan empire into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]], due to the missionary efforts of a great number of Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into Chinese were either [[Parthia]]n, Kushan, [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]], or [[Kuchean]].&lt;ref&gt;Foltz, "Religions of the Silk Road", pp. 37–58&lt;/ref&gt;

This edict advocates the adoption of "godliness" using the Greek term [[Eusebeia]] for [[Dharma]]. [[Kabul]] Museum.]]

One result of the spread of Buddhism along the Silk Road was displacement and conflict. The Greek Seleucids were exiled to Iran and Central Asia because of a new Iranian dynasty called the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] at the beginning of the 2nd century BCE, and as a result the Parthians became the new middle men for trade in a period when the Romans were major customers for silk. Parthian scholars were involved in one of the first ever Buddhist text translations into the Chinese language. Its main trade centre on the Silk Road, the city of [[Merv]], in due course and with the coming of age of Buddhism in China, became a major Buddhist centre by the middle of the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foltz|first=Richard C.|title=Religions of the Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Exchange from Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century|year=1999|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge among people on the silk roads also increased when Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya dynasty (268–239 BCE) converted to Buddhism and raised the religion to official status in his northern Indian empire.&lt;ref name="Foltz 1999 38"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foltz|first=Richard C.|title=Religions of the Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Exchange from Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century|year=1999|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 4th century CE onward, Chinese pilgrims also started to travel on the Silk Road to India to get improved access to the original Buddhist scriptures, with [[Fa-hsien]]'s pilgrimage to India (395–414), and later [[Xuanzang]] (629–644) and [[Hyecho]], who traveled from Korea to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/srtravelmain.shtml|title=Ancient Silk Road Travellers|author1=Silkroad Foundation|author2=Adela C.Y.

There were many different schools of Buddhism travelling on the Silk Road. The Dharmaguptakas and the Sarvastivadins were two of the major Nikaya schools. These were both eventually displaced by the Mahayana, also known as "Great Vehicle". This movement of Buddhism first gained influence in the [[Khotan]] region.&lt;ref name="Foltz 1999 38"/&gt; The Mahayana, which was more of a "pan-Buddhist movement" than a school of Buddhism, appears to have begun in northwestern India or Central Asia. It formed during the 1st century BCE and was small at first, and the origins of this "Greater Vehicle" are not fully clear. Some Mahayana scripts were found in northern Pakistan, but the main texts are still believed to have been composed in Central Asia along the Silk Road. These different schools and movements of Buddhism were a result of the diverse and complex influences and beliefs on the Silk Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foltz|first=Richard C.|title=Religions of the Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Exchange from Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century|year=1999|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of Mahayana Buddhism, the initial direction of Buddhist development changed. This form of Buddhism highlighted, as stated by Xinru Liu, "the elusiveness of physical reality, including material wealth." It also stressed getting rid of material desire to a certain point; this was often difficult for followers to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, "The Silk Road in World History" (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 5th and 6th centuries CE, [[merchants]] played a large role in the spread of religion, in particular Buddhism. Merchants found the moral and ethical teachings of Buddhism an appealing alternative to previous religions. As a result, merchants supported Buddhist monasteries along the Silk Road, and in return the Buddhists gave the merchants somewhere to stay as they traveled from city to city. As a result, merchants spread Buddhism to foreign encounters as they traveled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry H. Bentley]], ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants also helped to establish [[diaspora]] within the communities they encountered, and over time their cultures became based on Buddhism. As a result, these communities became centers of literacy and culture with well-organized marketplaces, lodging, and storage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry H. Bentley]], ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The voluntary conversion of Chinese ruling elites helped the spread of Buddhism in East Asia and led Buddhism to become widespread in Chinese society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry H. Bentley]], ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism essentially ended around the 7th century with the rise of Islam in Central Asia.

===Transmission of art===
{{Main article|Silk Road transmission of art}}
[[File:WindGods.JPG|thumb|upright=1.6|Iconographical evolution of the Wind God. Left: Greek Wind God from [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], 2nd century. Middle: Wind God from [[Kizil Caves|Kizil]], [[Tarim Basin]], 7th century. Right: Japanese Wind God [[Fūjin|Fujin]], 17th century.]]

Many artistic influences were transmitted via the Silk Road, particularly through [[Central Asia]], where [[Hellenistic]], [[Persian art|Iranian]], [[Indian art|Indian]] and [[Chinese art|Chinese]] influences could intermix. [[Greco-Buddhist art]] represents one of the most vivid examples of this interaction. Silk was also a representation of art, serving as a religious symbol. Most importantly, silk was used as currency for trade along the silk road.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru, Liu,''The Silk Road in World History'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

These artistic influences can be seen in the development of Buddhism where, for instance, Buddha was first depicted as human in the Kushan period. Many scholars have attributed this to Greek influence. The mixture of Greek and Indian elements can be found in later Buddhist art in China and throughout countries on the Silk Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foltz|first=Richard C.|title=Religions of the Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Exchange from Antiquity to the Fifteenth Century|year=1999|publisher=St Martin's Press|location=New York|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of art consisted of many different items that were traded along the Silk Roads from the East to the West. One common product, the [[lapis lazuli]], was a blue stone with golden specks, which was used as paint after it was ground into powder.&lt;ref&gt;"The Silk Road and Beyond: Travel, Trade, and Transformation," Art Institute of Chicago website, {{cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/silkroad/themes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114062335/http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/silkroad/themes.html |archivedate=2016-11-14 |df= }}, retrieved on 15 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2014, the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] named the Silk Road a [[Silk Road UNESCO World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]] at the 2014 Conference on World Heritage. The [[United Nations]] [[World Tourism Organization]] has been working since 1993 to develop sustainable international tourism along the route with the stated goal of fostering peace and understanding.&lt;ref name="silkroad.unwto.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silkroad.unwto.org/en/content/objectives|title=Objectives|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315103354/http://silkroad.unwto.org/en/content/objectives|archivedate=2013-03-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6502">'''Wade Keller''' (born May 22, 1971) is an American [[professional wrestling]] journalist who runs the ''Pro Wrestling Torch'' newsletter. Keller has hosted ''The Wade Keller Pro Wrestling Podcast'' on [[PodcastOne]] since 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2017/07/18/first-wade-keller-pro-wrestling-podcast-podcast-one-dot-nets-jason-powell-guest/|title=The first Wade Keller Pro Wrestling Podcast on Podcast One with Dot Net's Jason Powell as a guest|date=July 18, 2017|website=ProWrestling.net|access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Pro Wrestling Torch'' ==
Keller founded ''Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/09/12/wrestlers-going-to-the-mat-for-gay-rights-not-exactly/bff0e5e7-2c9c-40aa-aeb1-bb48639e3437/|title=Wrestlers Going to the Mat For Gay Rights? Not Exactly.|first=Hank|last=Stuever|date=September 12, 2002|publisher=|access-date=December 29, 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (aka ''PWTorch'', or simply ''The Torch'') in October 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itsalljournalism.com/262-30-years-of-wrestling-coverage-from-diy-newsletter-to-podcast-pro/|title=#262—Wade Keller: 30 years of wrestling journalism|date=July 20, 2017|website=ItsAllJournalism.com|access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was a junior in high school. The newsletter is published weekly from his [[Minnesota]] home, with the content also published to an accompanying website which was launched in 1999. Keller's work includes weekly columns, news reporting and analysis, as well as interviews in both print and audio format. He works closely with wrestlers, promoters and wrestling fans to gather the information for his features. The ''Pro Wrestling Torch Livecast'' was broadcast via [[BlogTalkRadio]] until 2017.

One of Keller's yearly features is the ''Torch Talk'', in which he conducts interviews with wrestlers. Keller is also the host of ''Pro Wrestling's Ultimate Insiders'', a series of interviews with prominent wrestling personalities that are released on [[DVD]]. The first edition featured [[Vince Russo]] and [[Ed Ferrara]], former writers for [[WWE]] and [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], while the second edition was conducted with [[Jeff Hardy|Jeff]] [[The Hardy Boyz|and]] [[Matt Hardy]]. Another was conducted with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] and [[Xtreme Pro Wrestling|XPW]] wrestler [[New Jack]].

== ''MMA Torch'' ==
Wade Keller also created and oversees ''MMA Torch'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmatorch.com|title=Home|website=MMATorch|access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a website devoted to the world of [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA). The site has been around since the early 2000s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmatorch.com/artman2/publish/About_Us_29/article_4959.shtml|title=About Us: Our history, our staff, our exclusive features, what sets us apart from the rest|work=MMA Torch|date=April 17, 2009|accessdate=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the very first sites to ever devote coverage to the world of MMA. He has interviewed [[Dana White]], original [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] matchmaker [[Art Davie]] and UFC announcer [[Mike Goldberg]]. Before the ''MMA Torch'' website was launched, Keller's MMA coverage was included in the pages of the ''Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter'', including coverage of the very [[UFC 1|first UFC pay-per-view]]. The site provides news, interviews, analysis and opinions as well as a message board feature.
