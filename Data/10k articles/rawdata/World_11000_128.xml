      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5170">The '''7 Most Endangered Programme''' identifies endangered monuments and sites in Europe and mobilizes public and private partners on a local, national and European level to find a viable future for those sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europanostra.org/7-most-endangered/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It was launched by [[Europa Nostra]] and the [[European Investment Bank]] Institute in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_BEI-13-10_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/apr/18/europe-most-threatened-sites-landmarks&lt;/ref&gt;

The 7 Most Endangered Programme is inspired by a successful programme of the US [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], based in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/19/most-endangered-european-heritage-sites_n_3294405.html&lt;/ref&gt; It does not provide funding. Its aim is to serve as a catalyst for action and raise awareness.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/the-7-most-endangered/gRVtukUq?position=0%2C-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Entries can be submitted by Europa Nostra’s country representations, member and associate organisations as well as by established public and private bodies active in the heritage field located in countries where Europa Nostra is not yet represented.

An international advisory panel, comprising specialists in [[history]], [[archaeology]], [[architecture]], [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] and [[finance]], meet to discuss over the applications and shortlist the most endangered monuments and sites. The board of Europa Nostra reviews the list&lt;ref&gt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Wiki_Loves_Monuments_2013/7_Most_Endangered_Monuments&lt;/ref&gt; which is then publicly announced during an annual congress.

Rescue missions to the sites included in the final list are then organised and the sites are visited. The results and recommendations of the rescue missions are summarised in reports that become available on the organisation's website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europanostra.org/7-most-endangered/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''African immigrants to Latin America''' include [[Citizenship|citizens]] and residents of countries in [[Latin America]] who were born in, or with recent ancestors from [[Africa]]. This excludes descendants of people who were forcibly transported to the Americas through the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

[[Yale University]] published a report on the increasing immigration of people from the African continent to countries in Latin America. This report explains this trend in immigration as being due to the stricter border controls and immigration policies by countries across Europe.
This report also cites rises in xenophobic sentiment across Europe as a reason for increased migration of African immigrants from Africa to [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2010/11/4cdacd4c6/africans-asians-attracted-latin-america-migration-route.html|title=Africans and Asians attracted to Latin America as a migration route|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|work=UNHCR|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil is cited as having the largest black population of any country outside of Africa. Brazil's and most of Latin America's friendly immigration policies attract migration from people from the African countries who seek to be integrated into society. Access to free healthcare and Spanish education also incentivize immigration to Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/more-african-immigrants-finding-home-latin-america|title=More African Immigrants Finding a Home in Latin America {{!}} YaleGlobal Online|website=yaleglobal.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
[[File:LatinAmericaNetMigration.svg|thumb|Latin America Net Migration]]
During the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] and [[Angolan Civil War|Angolan]] and [[Mozambican Civil War]]s, a large number of [[Angola]]ns and Mozambicans (including [[white Africans|white Angolans and Mozambicans]] of [[Portuguese Africans|Portuguese descent]]) fled to [[Brazil]] (also a former Portuguese colony, as [[Portugal]] was also a major destination for refugees) and became citizens.

After the end of both wars, most migration across the Atlantic to Latin America was from [[West Africa]], often due to political and [[socioeconomic]] instability, and a trend toward the tightening of border security in the [[European Union]] in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century. The process of settlement and [[citizenship]] acquisition, however, has been eased for these immigrants due to the presence of pre-existing Black diaspora populations in such countries as [[Brazil]], which has minimized local trends towards [[xenophobia]] or [[colorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andres |first=Luis |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5AF0AG20091116 |title=African immigrants drift toward Latin America |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2009-11-15 |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
* [[Argentina]] - 3000 African immigrants

== Brazil ==

* [[Brazil]] - at least 3000-4000 African immigrants (including 2000 immigrants from Nigeria)

===Immigration to Brazil between the late 19th century to early 20th century===

In the period between the late 19th century and the early 20th century, Brazilian immigration policy became restrictive of migration by populations from Africa in an effort to shift the population's racial demographic from being diverse to a white majority one. These policies worked by encouraging migration of people of European descent and making it difficult for people of African descent to enter the country. This same stance was imposed on Asians. These policies differed sharply from policies in the United States that enforced segregation and racial inequality. Brazil's policies were rooted in its history of interracial blending and relationships between the native people of Brazil, Europeans, and Africans.

== Paraguay ==

In 1974, South Africa and Paraguay announced an attitude of friendship between the two states. It was the beginning of an era of friendship between countries on opposite sides of the Atlantic, coming at a period in which South Africa was isolated from the rest of the Western world which it had up to this point so depended on for support and recognition. South African efforts to form links with Latin American states was driven by a desire to oppose the world's efforts to isolate South Africa because of its policies of Apartheid.South Africa sought links with Paraguay to find new markets for its manufactured goods.

==White farmers fleeing revolutions in Africa==

Latin American countries like Paraguay expressed an interest in attracting farmers from Southern Africa who were fleeing the possibility of majority rule, intensifying guerilla wars, and revolutionary wars for independence. Paraguay observed the expertise and experience of these farmers and expressed an interest in utilizing their technical expertise to develop land and the economy in Paraguay. Government officials traveled to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to advertise the possibility of resettling of farmers to Paraguay. That visit prompted 40 Rhodesian farmers to visit Argentina to explore possibilities of farming there. At international talks, West German delegates made an offer to Latin American governments of 150 million dollars in order for them to accept 30,000 white farmers of German descended from Namibia, South Africa, and Rhodesia.&lt;ref&gt;FIG, DAVID, and Latin America Bureau. “THE SOUTH ATLANTIC CONNECTION: GROWING LINKS BETWEEN SOUTH AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA.” Britain and Latin America 1979: An Annual Review of British-Latin American Relations, Latin American Bureau, London, 1979, pp. 90–126.

== History ==

Al-Farooj Fresh was founded by a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] family in 1994, with the first branch opening at [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] in the United Arab Emirates that year. By 2006 the chain had expanded to a total of eight branches.&lt;ref name="AF1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfarooj.com/|title=History and Expansion|work=alfarooj.com|publisher=Al Farooj|accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2006, at the Gulfood Exhibition held at the [[Dubai International Convention Centre|Dubai International Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre]], it was announced that Al Farooj was acquired by the [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Mohammed Bin Rashid]]  Establishment for Young Business Leaders,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} an organisation launched in 2002 to encourage and facilitate the development of business and entrepreneurial activity among UAE nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smeawards.ae/english/index.html|title=Mohammed Bin Rashid awards|work=smeawards.ae|publisher=SME Awards|accessdate=2009-05-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426032642/http://smeawards.ae/english/index.html| archivedate= 26 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Establishment worked jointly with Al Islami to introduce the concept to UAE entrepreneurs after final approval of Al Islami on the franchisee selection.

In February, 2008, Al Islami acquired majority shares of the Al Farooj restaurant chain, relaunching the franchise later that month with plans to expand operations to serve the Middle Eastern market.&lt;ref name="BME"&gt;{{cite journal | title = What's new in your industry: Food, beverages and tobacco: UAE | date = March 16, 2008 | work = Business Middle East | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with the relaunch of Al Farooj Fresh, Al Islami announced plans to unveil their hospitality arm, of which Al Farooj Fresh was a major part of the portfolio – along with Al Islami Cart, Al Islami Meat Shops and a number of food products.&lt;ref name="KT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data/business/2008/February/business_February677.xml&amp;section=business&amp;col=|title=Al Islami Foods set to unveil hospitality arm|date=February 23, 2008|work=khaleejtimes.com|publisher=[[Khaleej Times]]|accessdate=2009-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's expansion continued into 2009, with Al Islami revealing that they would be expanding the Al Farooj chain to 17 branches with an investment of DHS 8 million (appx [[United States|$]]2.2 million), providing them with 17 branches worldwide consisting of 14 in the UAE, 1 in [[Oman]] and 2 in [[Lebanon]].,&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt; and [[Kuwait]].

[[File:KZ-2011-50tenge-Aytysh-b.png|thumb|right|Aytysh competition]]
'''Aytysh''' ({{lang-ky|айтыш}}, {{IPA-ky|ɑjˈtɯʃ|pron}}) or '''Aytys''' ({{lang-kk|айтыс|translit=aıtys}}, {{IPA-kk|ɑjˈtəs|pron}}) is a song competition held between two [[akyn|aqyn]]s.  Each usually strums a national instrument ([[qomuz]] in the case of the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[dombra]] in the case of the [[Kazakhs]]), and they respond to each other in [[wikt:spontaneous|spontaneous]] [[rhyme|rhyming]] verse on a range of topics.  They may make backhanded political statements, criticise each other's style, flirt (if of the opposite sex), and flat-out insult one another, but it is all done in good humour: Kyrgyz aqyns even often state that one must have good intentions to be a good aqyn.  Because of this, it is a commonly held belief that one cannot hold what an aqyn says against them, and the only way for one aqyn to "get back at" another aqyn is to attempt to outdo them at aytysh.  

Despite the custom to allow aqyns all forms of slander, there are known cases of aqyns in [[Kazakhstan]] being threatened for making political statements against the [[Nursultan Nazarbayev|president]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Kyrgyz aqyns claim that it is important to be aware of their audience to perform well, and hence, some find it difficult to perform in isolation (e.g., in a studio without a live audience).  The audience often votes on the winner in a competition, though this isn't a formal process—many people can "feel" (without anyone stating it overtly) which aqyn the audience has converged upon as a winner just by the crowd's [[group dynamics|dynamics]].

Usually aqyns compete against other aqyns of same nationality, but due to a high level of mutual intelligibility between the Kyrgyz and Kazakh languages, there have been cases, even in recent years, where Kyrgyz and Kazakh aqyns have competed against one another.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}

'''Baħrija''' is a small rural village in [[Rabat, Malta]], with a low population density. The name Baħrija means ''moth'' in [[Maltese language|Maltese]]. It is also known in English as Baħria, of which the Counts Moscati had owned the fiefdom that was granted by the Grand Master of Malta.

==Overview==
Two churches are present in Baħrija, an old one (which was re-inaugurated on Saturday 19 October 2013), and the newer church, built in 1984, which is dedicated to [[Saint Martin of Tours]] and which is currently in use.

The main feast in Baħrija is that of Saint Martin of Tours, which is celebrated annually on 11 November. This feast is associated with an old tradition where a bag full of an assortment of nuts, sweets and fresh fruit is given to young children on the day.

Another tradition present exclusively in Baħrija is the annual fair which is held on the Sunday before the feast, where an assortment of goods are given away in a number of lotteries.

Baħrija is also famous for its rabbit cooking restaurants.

Bahrija is one of the highest places in Malta, therefore the weather here is cooler than that of the lower land (it is also exposed to the cold northern winds coming over the sea). Most of the north of Malta is visible from this village, but the south west of Gozo (including Xlendi) is also visible, and on clear still nights, a line of street lights is visible on the horizon to the north, where Sicily is.

Although Bahrija has little rich soil, much of its land is used for agriculture, mostly growing grape vines and other common fruit that can withstand the harsh heat of the summer and the lack of soil.

Bahrija is a good place to search for walks. For a cliff climb, there is the Fomm ir-Rih walk, or for Maltese heritage, the Victoria lines start at Kuncizzjoni.

The '''Chelkans''' (native name - Shalgan) are a small [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]] living in southern [[Siberia]]. Those residing in [[Altai Republic]] are sometimes grouped together with the [[Altay people|Altay]] ethnic group and those in [[Kemerovo Oblast]] are grouped with the [[Shors]]; however, they are recognized as a separate ethnic group by ethnographers. According to the 2010 [[census]], there were 1,181 Chelkans in [[Russia]].

The '''Cilentana Nera''' is an indigenous [[breed]] of [[goat|domestic goat]] from the [[province of Salerno]], in [[Campania]] in southern Italy. It takes its name from the geographical region of the [[Cilento]], much of which is today within the [[Parco Nazionale del Cilento, Vallo di Diano e Alburni]], and is raised mainly in that area and in the [[Monti Alburni]]. The range extends to the [[Monti Picentini]]&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; and to the area of [[Ricigliano]] in eastern Campania and [[Muro Lucano]] in [[Basilicata]].&lt;ref name=pulina/&gt; It is one of three goat breeds in the Cilento, the others being the [[Cilentana Grigia]] and the [[Cilentana Fulva]]. The Cilentana Nera is found on higher ground and poorer pasture than the other two, and is raised mainly for meat. It has been influenced by the [[Garganica]] and [[Napoletana]] goat breeds.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt;

The Cilentana Nera is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the [[Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia]], the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders.&lt;ref name=dm/&gt;&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt; In the 1980s numbers were very low, and in 1983 it was thought to be close to extinction; however, a census in 2008 found 3683 head,&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; and at the end of 2013 the registered population was variously reported as 2403&lt;ref name=aspa2/&gt; and as 2098.&lt;ref name=dad/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2099">'''Cilindar''' ({{lang-mk|Цилиндар}}) is a [[New wave music|new wave]], [[ska]], [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] and [[reggae]] band from [[Skopje]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]] formed in the early 1980s, in the then [[SR Macedonia]].

Today its former members are respectable solo or band artists in the [[Ethnic Macedonian music|Macedonian music]] scene:

*Dimitar "Mite" Dimovski - {{lang|mk|Димитар Мите Димовски}} ([[Drum kit|drums]]) is a drummer of the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[cult band]] [[Arhangel]].
*Petar Rendžov - {{lang|mk|Петар Ренџов}} ([[guitar]]) became a prominent [[ethno jazz]] and [[blues]] guitarist as well as studio musician for other popular artists.
*[[Risto Samardžiev]] - {{lang|mk|Ристо Самарџиев}} ([[Singing|vocals]]) - after the dissolution of Cilindar in 1983 he formed the [[New Romantic]] and later [[pop music|pop]] band [[Haos in Laos]] in 1984. In 1987 he started a successful solo career as a pop singer winning an award for best performance at the [[MakFest|Makfest]] festival in the same year. Later he was also a vocalist of the popular Macedonian band [[Memorija]]. Several times he was also a candidate at the Macedonian national preselections for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].

The band recorded several songs and videos for the national [[Macedonian Radio-Television]] of which ''Samo eden del'' is the most popular.

After its split in the mid-1980s, the band members gathered again for a reunion concert at the [[Bob Marley]] tribute festival held in Skopje in 2008.

==Trivia==
The name of the band is a misspelling of the word ''Cylinder'' (''{{lang|mk|Цилиндер}}'') which means a cylinder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="933">The '''Constitution (Amendment No. 2) Act 1927''' was an Act amending the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]].  It amended Article 21 of the constitution to provide for the automatic re-election of the Ceann Comhairle of Dail Eireann.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1927/act/6/enacted/en/print.html&lt;/ref&gt;

That procedure continues to this day under the 1937 constitution.

The Act became obsolete on the repeal of the 1922 Constitution in 1937, and has formally been repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2016/1616/B16b16S.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statute Law Revision Bill 2016 |website=Oireachtas.ie |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Could It Be That I'm In Love"''' was the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[Kim Jackson]]. She is the daughter of Ann McConnell, a successful Irish cabaret singer.  Jackson had provided backing vocals for Ireland's Eurovision entry the previous year ([[Somewhere in Europe (song)|Somewhere in Europe]]), and her entry was in fact written and composed by the performer of that previous entry ([[Liam Reilly]]), one of the rare occasions when such a thing has happened in Contest history.

The song is a ballad, with Jackson confessing her feelings to her lover. She sings that she is unsure of exactly what her feelings mean, but wonders if they mean that she is in love with him.

The song was performed eleventh on the night, following [[Turkey]]'s [[İzel Çeliköz]], [[Reyhan Karaca]] &amp; [[Can Uğurlür]] with "[[İki Dakika]]" and preceding [[Portugal]]'s [[Dulce Pontes|Dulce]] with "[[Lusitana paixão]]". At the close of voting, it had received 47 points, placing 10th in a field of 22. The song peaked at number #7 in the Irish Singles chart.

It was succeeded as [[Republic of Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Irish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992|1992 Contest]] by [[Linda Martin]] with "[[Why Me? (Linda Martin song)|Why Me?]]".

A [[non-binding referendum|non-binding]] '''referendum on the Single European Act''' was held in [[Denmark]] on 27 February 1986.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p525 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was approved by 56.2% of voters,&lt;ref name="euoplysningen"&gt;[http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/dkeu/dk/afstemninger/afstemning/1986/ Folkeafstemning om EF-pakken] EU Oplysningen {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a voter participation of 75.4%.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p534&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was held by the government of the [[Prime Minister of Denmark]], [[Poul Schlüter]]. The government was in favour of Denmark ratifying the [[Single European Act]], but a majority in [[Folketinget|parliament]] was against it.&lt;ref name="euoplysningen"/&gt; The referendum was the last Europe-related referendum in which parties such as the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and the [[Social Liberal Party (Denmark)|Social Liberal Party]] recommended against ratification.

{{World economy}}
The '''economy of Asia''' comprises more than 4.5 billion people (60% of the [[world population]]) living in 49 different nation [[Sovereign state|states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Population of Asia in 2014 |url= http://www.worldpopulationstatistics.com/population-of-asia-2014 |website= World Population Statistics |accessdate= 25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six further states lie partly in [[Asia]], but are considered to belong to another region economically and politically. Asia is the fastest growing economic region, as well as the largest continental economy by both [[GDP]] [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|Nominal]] and [[purchasing power parity|PPP]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD|url=http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD |work= www.imf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[South Korea]] and [[Indonesia]] are currently the top five economies in Asia. Moreover, Asia is the site of some of the world's longest modern economic booms, starting from the [[Japanese economic miracle]] (1950–1990), [[Miracle on the Han River]] (1961–1996) in South Korea, [[Taiwan Miracle]] (1962-2012) in Taiwan, [[Chinese economic reform|economic boom]] (1978–2013) in China and [[Economic liberalisation in India|economic boom]] in India (1991–present).

As in all world regions, the wealth of Asia differs widely between, and within, states. This is due to its vast size, meaning a huge range of different cultures, environments, historical ties and government systems. The largest economies in Asia in terms of [[purchasing power parity|PPP]] [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) are [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Indonesia]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Philippines]] and in terms of nominal [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) are [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[South Korea]],  , [[Indonesia]], [[Turkey]], [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]], [[United Arab Emirates]] ,   [[Iran]], [[Malaysia]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Singapore]].

Wealth (if measured by GDP [[per capita]]) is mostly concentrated in the [[East Asia]] in territories of [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Singapore]], and [[Brunei]], as well as in oil rich countries in [[West Asia]] such as [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], and [[Oman]]. [[Israel]] and, to a lesser extent [[Turkey]] are exceptions: both lie in the territory of Asia despite not often being counted as such. Israel (entrepreneurship on diversified industries) is a developed country, while Turkey (founding member of [[OECD]]) is an advanced emerging country. Asia, with the exception of Japan (heavy industry and electrical sophistication), South Korea (heavy industry and information and communication technology), Taiwan (light industry and hi-tech parts manufacturing), Hong Kong (financial industry and services) and Singapore (high-tech manufacturing, biotechnology, financial and business services, and tourism governed by [[Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore]]) in recent years, is currently undergoing rapid growth and [[industrialization]], and China (manufacturing and FDI-led growth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.adb.org/publications/series/asian-economic-integration-report | title=Asian Economic Integration Reports| date=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and India (commodities, outsourcing destination and computer software), the two fastest growing major economies in the world. East Asian and [[ASEAN|Southeast Asian]] countries generally rely on manufacturing and trade (and then gradually upgrade to industry and commerce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.e-ir.info/2014/10/16/the-asian-tigers-from-independence-to-industrialisation/ | title=The Asian Tigers from Independence to Industrialisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and incrementally building on [[high-tech]] industry and [[financial industry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.adb.org/publications/series/asian-development-outlook | title=Asian Development Outlook (ADO) Series| date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; for growth, countries in the Middle East depend more on [[engineering]] to overcome climate difficulties for economic growth and the production of commodities, principally [[Sweet crude oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/asia-resources/ | title=Asia: Resources| date=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, with rapid economic growth and large [[Balance of trade|trade surplus]] with the rest of the world, Asia has accumulated over US$4 trillion of [[foreign exchange reserves]] – more than half of the world's total, and adding [[Tertiary sector of the economy]] and [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] to expand in the share of Asia's economy.

The accidental discovery of America by Columbus in search for India demonstrates this deep fascination. The [[Silk Road]] became the main East-West trading route in the Asian hitherland while the [[Straits of Malacca]] stood as a major sea route.

===Pre–1945===
Prior to World War II, most of Asia was under [[colonialism|colonial rule]]. Only relatively few states managed to remain independent in the face of constant pressure exerted by European power. Such examples are China, [[Siam]] and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colonial Rule|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/amerbegin/power/text4/text4read.htm|website=National Humanities Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan in particular managed to develop its economy due to a reformation in the 19th century. The reformation was comprehensive and is today known as the [[Meiji Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meiji Restoration|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373305/Meiji-Restoration|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese economy continued to grow well into the 20th century and its economic growth created various shortages of resources essential to economic growth.  As a result, the [[First Sino-Japanese war|Japanese expansion]] began with a great part of Korea and China annexed, thus allowing the Japanese to secure strategic resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sino-Japanese War|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/546176/Sino-Japanese-War|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Southeast Asia was prospering due to trade and the introduction of various new technologies of that time. The volume of trade continued to increase with the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in the 1860s. [[Manila]] had its [[Manila galleon]] wherein products from the [[Spanish East Indies|Philippine islands]] and China were traded with Spanish America and Europe from 1571 to 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manila galleon|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362297/Manila-galleon|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish colony of the Philippines was the first Asian territory to trade with the Americas, from Manila to [[Acapulco]]. The route continued overland across present-day Mexico to [[Veracruz]] on the Atlantic coast, then to [[Havana]] and [[Seville]], forming the first global trade route. Silk, porcelain, ivory, tobacco, coconut and corn were some of the goods exported from Asia to the Americas and Europe, through the Philippines.

[[Singapore]], founded in 1819, rose to prominence as trade between the east and the west increased at an incredible rate. The British colony of [[British Malaya|Malaya]], now part of [[Malaysia]], was the world's largest producer of [[tin]] and [[rubber]]. The [[Dutch East Indies]], now Indonesia, on the other hand, was known for its [[spices]] production. Both the British and the Dutch created their own trading companies to manage their trade flow in Asia. The British created the [[British East India Company]] while the Dutch formed [[Dutch East India Company]]. Both companies maintained trade monopolies of their respective colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Philippines|url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/History/Philippines-history.htm|website=Nations Online|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East India Company|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/176643/East-India-Company|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch East India Trading Company|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/174523/Dutch-East-India-Company|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, [[crude oil]] was first discovered in [[Persian Empire|Persia]], modern day Iran. Afterwards, many oil fields were discovered and it was learnt later that the Middle East possesses the world's largest oil stocks. This made the rulers of the Arab nations very rich though the socioeconomic development in that region lagged behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Alfred|first1=Randy|title=May 26, 1908: Mideast Oil Discovered – There Will Be Blood|url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/05/dayintech_0526|journal=Wired|accessdate=25 November 2014|date=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, the world underwent a global [[economic depression]], today known as the [[Great Depression]]. Asia was not spared, and suffered the same pain as Europe and the United States. The volume of trade decreased dramatically all around Asia and indeed the world. With falling demand, prices of various goods starting to fall and further impoverished locals and foreigners alike. In 1931 Japan invaded [[Manchuria]] and subsequently the rest of China and south-east Asia in what eventually became the Asia-pacific leg of [[World War Two]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War 2 in the Pacific|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005155|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1945–1990===
Following World War II, the People's Republic of China and India, which account for half of the population of Asia, adopted socialist policies to promote their domestic economy. These policies limited the economic growth of the region. They are being abandoned in India and reformed in China. In contrast, the economies of Japan and the [[Four Asian Tigers]] ([[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]]) were economic successes, and the only successful economies outside of the [[Western World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting Globalization Right: The East Asian Tigers|url=http://oecdinsights.org/2012/05/03/getting-globalization-right-the-east-asian-tigers/|website=OECD Insights}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of these four economies led other Southeast Asian countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand to follow suit in opening up their economies and setting up export-oriented manufacturing bases that boosted their growth throughout the 1980s and the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The East Asian Miracle|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c11011.pdf|website=National Bureau of Economic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most pronounced Asian economic phenomenons during this time, the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle]], greatly impacted the rest of the world. After World War II, under central guidance from the Japanese government, the entire economy was undergoing a remarkable restructuring. Close cooperation between the government, corporations and banks facilitated easy access to much-needed capital, and large conglomerates known as ''[[keiretsu]]'' spurred [[horizontal integration|horizontal]] and [[vertical integration]] across all industries, keeping out foreign competition. These policies, in addition to an abandonment of military spending, worked phenomenally well. Japanese corporations as a result exported and still export massive amounts of high quality products from "the Land of the Rising Sun".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=G.C.|title=Japan's Economy recovery|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7583392|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=19|issue=2|pages=278–279|doi=10.1017/S0022050700110034|year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another amazing economic success story is that of South Korea's, also referred to as the [[Miracle on the Han River]]. The country was left impoverished after the [[Korean War]], and until the early 1970s was among the world's poorest countries (even poorer than [[North Korea]]). However, it was since able to recover with double digit annual growth rates. Many conglomerates, also known as [[chaebol]]s, such as [[Samsung]], [[LG Corp]], [[Hyundai]], [[Kia Motors|Kia]], [[SK Group]], and more grew tremendously during this period. [[South Korea]] has now become the most wired country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Seoul's Green Revolution|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501021014-361781,00.html|journal=Time|date=2002-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan and Hong Kong experienced rapid growth up till the 1990s. Taiwan became, and still remains one of the main centers of consumer electronics R&amp;D as well as manufacturing. However, unlike in Japan and South Korea, the bulk of Taiwan's economy is dependent on small to medium-sized businesses. Hong Kong, on the other hand, experienced rapid growth in the financial sector due to liberal market policies, with many financial institutions setting up their Asian headquarters in Hong Kong. Till today, Hong Kong has been ranked as the world's [[freest economy]] for many years running, and it remains among one of the world's top 5 leading financial centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hong Kong's status as world's freest economy threatened by Singapore, says Heritage Foundation|url=http://www.scmp.com/business/economy/article/1405318/hong-kongs-status-worlds-freest-economy-threatened-singapore-says?page=all|website=South China Morning Post-Economy|date=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Southeast Asia, economic development was fueled by the growth of the [[bamboo network]]. The bamboo network refers to a network of [[overseas Chinese]] businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bamboo Network: Asia's Family-run Conglomerates|url=http://www.strategy-business.com/article/9702?gko=4a3c6|website=Strategy +Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network expanded as Chinese refugees emigrated to Southeast Asia following the [[Chinese Civil War|Chinese Communist Revolution]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="Weidenbaum"&gt;{{cite book|author=Murray L Weidenbaum|title=The Bamboo Network: How Expatriate Chinese Entrepreneurs are Creating a New Economic Superpower in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcRlgZttsMUC|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Martin Kessler Books, Free Press|isbn=978-0-684-82289-1|pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]] in particular experienced very rapid economic growth after declaring independence in 1965, following a two-year federation with [[Malaysia]]. In addition to creating a conducive economic and political climate, the government developed the skills of its multi-racial workforce, and established export-oriented industries by encouraging foreign investors to set up regional operations in manufacturing. The government also played a prominent role in [[Singapore]]'s growth as a major financial and business services centre. [[Singapore]] is today one of the richest countries in the world, both in terms of [[GNI per capita]], and [[GDP (PPP) per capita]].

This period was also marked by military conflict. Wars driven by the [[Cold War]], notably in Vietnam and Afghanistan, wrecked the economies of these respective nations. When the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed in 1990–91, many [[Central Asia]]n states were cut free and were forced to adapt to pressure for democratic and economic change. Also, several of the USSR's allies lost valuable aid and funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korean War and Japan's Recovery|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/korean-war|website=Office of the Historian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991–2007===
The [[Economy of People's Republic of China|Chinese economy]] [[Chinese economic reform|boomed]] under the economic measures undertaken by [[Deng Xiaoping]], in the late 1970s, and continuing under [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Hu Jintao]] in the 1990s and 2000s. After the liberalization of the [[economy of India]], growth in India and China increasingly shifted the center of gravity of the global economy towards Asia. By the late 2000s, China's economic growth rate exceeded 11% while India's growth rate increased to around 9%. One of the factors was the sheer size of the population in this region.

Meanwhile, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore emerged as the [[Four Asian Tigers]] with their GDPs growing well above 7% per year in the 1980s and the 1990s. Their economies were mainly driven by growing exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asianomics: Dynamics of Asia's Economic Growth|url=http://board.mk.co.kr/view.php?id=wkf2011_news_e&amp;p=&amp;c=0&amp;f=&amp;fk=&amp;s=&amp;o=&amp;v=&amp;brand_code=&amp;no=25|website=World Knowledge Forum|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines only began to open up its stagnated economy in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Page2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kogan Page|title=Asia and Pacific Review 2003/04|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1cpiEJMAi8C&amp;pg=PA295|year=2003|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-4063-3|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam's economy began to grow in 1995, shortly after the United States and [[Vietnam]] restored economic and political ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burghardt|first1=Raymond|title=Old Enemies Become Friends: U.S. and Vietnam|journal=Brookings East Asia Commentary|date=November 2006|issue=3|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2006/11/southeastasia-burghardt|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1990s, the manufacturing ability and cheap labor markets in Asian developing nations allowed companies to establish themselves in many of the industries previously dominated by companies from developed nations. By the dawn of the 21st century, Asia became the world's largest continental source of [[automobiles]], [[machinery]], audio equipment and other [[electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=Wayne|title=China-U.S. Trade Issues|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33536.pdf|website=Federation of American Scientist|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1997, Thailand was hit by [[speculation|currency speculators]], and the value of the [[Thai baht|Baht]] along with its annual growth rate fell dramatically. Soon after, the [[Asian financial crisis|crisis]] spread to the ASEAN region, South Korea and other countries in Asia, resulting in great economic damage on the affected countries (but with Japan and China both largely escaping the crisis). In fact, some of the economies, most notably those of Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea actually contracted. By 1999, most countries had already recovered from the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elangkovan|first1=Kaviyarasu|last2=Said|first2=Muhammad|title=he Asian Financial Crisis 1997–1998 and Malaysian Response: An Analytical Approach|journal=Australian Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences|date=2013|pages=622–633|url=https://www.academia.edu/5973877|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, almost all economies in both Europe and Asia were adversely affected by the [[September 11 attacks]], with Indonesia and Japan was hardest. Both continents quickly recovered from the attacks in United States after more than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9/11 Attacks|url=http://www.history.com/topics/9-11-attacks|website=history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, parts of Sumatra and South Asia were severely damaged by [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|an earthquake and the subsequent tsunami]]. The tsunami wreaked havoc, causing massive damage in the infrastructure of the hit areas, particularly Indonesia, and displaced millions. For a short time, GDP contracted among nations such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Sri Lanka]], despite massive inflow of foreign aid in the aftermath of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Jayasuriya|first1=Sisira|last2=McCawley|first2=Peter|title=Reconstruction after a Major Disaster:  Lessons from the Post-Tsunami Experience in Indonesia,  Sri Lanka, and Thailand|url=https://www.adb.org/publications/reconstruction-after-major-disaster-lessons-post-tsunami-experience-indonesia-sri-lanka|website=ADB Institute|accessdate=28 March 2016|publisher=Asian Development Bank|date=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economy of Japan|Japan]] suffered its worst post-World War II economic stagnation set in the early 1990s (which coincided with the end of [[Cold War]]), which was triggered by the latter event of [[Asian financial crisis]] in 1997. It, however, rebounded strongly in the early 2000s due to strong growth in exports, although unable to counteract China in 2005 after China gradually surpassed it as the largest economy in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Korean War and Japan's Recovery|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/korean-war|website=Office of Historian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008–present===
In 2008, the [[Financial Crisis of 2008|Global Financial Crisis]], triggered by the housing bubble in the [[United States]], caused a significant decline in the GDP of the majority of the [[Economy of Europe|European economies]]. In contrast, most Asian economies experienced a temporary slowdown in their rates of economic growth, particularly [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and [[China]], resuming their normal growth soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holt|first1=Jeff|title=A Summary of the Primary Causes of the Housing Bubble and the Resulting Credit Crisis: A Non-Technical Paper|url=http://www.uvu.edu/woodbury/docs/summaryoftheprimarycauseofthehousingbubble.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arab Spring]] since 2011 had caused economic malaise in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Yemen]], amongst the most adversely affected nations in the Middle East. At the same time, in the early 2010s, [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Kuwait]] registered high GDP growths in the years that followed due to increased oil prices and further diversification of exports, as well as rising [[Foreign exchange reserves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arab Spring of 2005|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/opinion/2002214060_krauthammer21.html|website=Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, in a once-in-a-decade party leadership reshuffle in [[China]] (change of [[Hu-Wen Administration]] to [[Xi-Li Administration]]), the Chinese economy experienced a significant slowdown in the GDP growth, slowing down from the unprecedented decades of 9–10% annual growth to around 7–8%, which has significant effect in some developing economies, particularly in Southeast Asia and [[India]].

The [[Philippines]], however, managed to grow at rates at par with China in the period 2012–2013, and became Asia's fastest-growing economy beginning 2014. It also recovered after getting hit by [[Typhoon Haiyan]], the strongest storm on record to make landfall, in November 2013, which killed at least 5,200 and displacing millions more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China's Dodgy Data Is Under Scrutiny Again, With Latest GDP Release|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-24/chinas-dodgy-data-under-scrutiny-again-with-latest-gdp-release|website=Bloomberg Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2013, China opened the [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone]]. This free trade zone allows international trade to be conducted with fewer restrictions and lower customs duties.  The zone is tax free for the first ten years to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) with a 'negative list' used to regulate in which fields foreign investments are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondaq.com/x/310992/Corporate+Commercial+Law/China+Shanghai+Pilot+Free+Trade+Zone+II+New+Developments China: China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone (II): New Developments]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-24322313|title=Shanghai free-trade zone launched|newspaper=BBC News|date=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
Asia's large economic disparities are a source of major continuing tension in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=Manohar|last2=Inchauste|first2=Gabriela|last3=Feng|first3=Juan|title=Rising Inequality with High Growth and Falling Poverty and pacific|journal=An Eye on East Asia and Pacific|issue=9|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/09/05/000333037_20110905022828/Rendered/PDF/643770BRI0Risi00Box0361535B0PUBLIC0.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While global economic powers China, Japan, India, continue powering through, and Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, [[Thailand]], Vietnam, Bangladesh and [[Sri Lanka]] have entered the path to long-term growth, regions right next to these countries are in severe need of assistance.

Given the enormous quantity of cheap labor in the region, particularly in China and India, where large workforces provide an economic advantage over other countries, the rising standard of living will eventually lead to a slow-down. Asia is also riddled with political problems that threaten not just the economies, but the general stability of the region and world. The nuclear neighbors—Pakistan and India—constantly pose a threat to each other, causing their governments to invest heavily in [[military spending]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Military expenditure|url=http://www.sipri.org/yearbook/2003/10|website=SIPRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another potential global danger posed by the economy of Asia is the growing accumulation of [[foreign exchange reserves]].  The countries/regions with the largest foreign reserves are mostly in Asia – China (Mainland – $2,454 billion &amp; Hong Kong – $245 billion, June 2010), Japan ($1,019 billion, June 2009), Russia ($456 billion, April 2010), India ($400 billion, October 2017), Taiwan ($372 billion, September 2010), South Korea ($286 billion, July 2010), and [[Singapore]] ($206 billion, July 2010). This increasingly means that the interchangeability of the Euro, USD, and GBP are heavily influenced by Asian central banks. Some economists in the western countries see this as a bad thing, prompting their respective governments to take action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) |url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/cofer/eng/ |website=International Monetary Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008044100/http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/cofer/eng/ |archivedate=2014-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Bank]], China surpassed the United States and the European Union to become the world's largest economy by early 2015, followed by India.

===Recent reforms in China===
[[File:Hong Kong Exchange Trade Lobby 2005.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong Exchange Trade Lobby 2005]]
Following a Third Plenum of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] in 2013 China revealed plans for several sweeping social and economic reforms.  The government would relax its [[one-child policy]] to allow single-child parents to have two kids.  This reform was implemented as a response to the aging population of China and provide more labor.  The government also reformed the [[hukou system]], allowing the labor force to become more mobile.&lt;ref name="CNBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101205322#.|title=China's economic reforms: What you need to know|work=CNBC|accessdate=1 October 2014|date=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reforms will make financial loan systems more flexible encouraging increased economic involvement of private firms.  Additionally, state-owned enterprises will be required to pay higher dividends to the government.  The benefits of this will go to Social Security.  Reform also allows farmers to own land for the first time ideally encouraging farmers to sell their land and move to cities which will boost consumerism and increase urban work force.&lt;ref name="CNBC"/&gt;

On April 10, 2014, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and Securities and Futures Commission (CSRC) made a Joint Announcement about the approval for the establishment of mutual stock market access between Mainland China and Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect|url=http://www.hkex.com.hk/eng/market/sec_tradinfra/chinaconnect/Documents/EP_CP_Book_En.pdf|website=Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the ‘Connect Program’, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited and Shanghai Stock Exchange will establish mutual order-routing connectivity and related technical infrastructure to enable investors to invest in Chinese equities market directly. On November 17, 2014, the program officially launched with the approvals from Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hunter|first1=Gregor|title=China to Start Stock Trading Link Next Week|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-start-stock-trading-link-next-week-1415581546|accessdate=24 November 2014|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Connect Program' is a groundbreaking initiative with significance to both Hong Kong and Mainland. It brings another opportunity for the growth of the Hong Kong securities market. More importantly, it provides, for the first time, a feasible, controllable and expandable channel to investors to invest in both Hong Kong and Mainland, in addition to current schemes including QDII, QFII, AND RDFII programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor|url=http://wikipedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect Program is open to all market participants, but those must satisfy all requirements prescribed by the exchange and regulators. The design of the program will ensure a minimal change of regulatory structure in each market as well as the ability to expand to other markets or other asset classes in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect|url=http://www.hkex.com.hk/eng/market/sec_tradinfra/chinaconnect/Documents/EP_CP_Book_En.pdf|website=Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local government’s spending plays a critical role in China’s fiscal system. Following the 1991 intergovernmental fiscal reform, the central government’s share of total fiscal revenue increase from less than 30 percent to around 50 percent in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Yuanyan|last2=Barnett|first2=Steven|title=Fiscal Vulnerabilities and Risks from Local Government Finance in China|journal=IMF Working Paper|date=January 2014|pages=1–28|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2014/wp1404.pdf|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local governments are now responsible for infrastructure investment, service delivery and social spending, which together account for about 85 percent of the total expenditure. Without a rule to guide the distribution of intergovernmental expenditure responsibilities, significant levels of risk would be associated with the spending.

China’s central administration will impose hard caps on local government borrowing in order to control financial risks from an explosive level. Statistics showed that total debt had reached $3 trillion by the middle of 2013, raising total government debt to 58 percent of GDP. Similar jump occurred in corporate debt as well, which pushed China’s overall debt-GDP ratio up to 261% from 148% in 2008. IMF warned that rapid debt run-ups could lead to financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wildau|first1=Gabriel|title=China to cap local government debt|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a2fb9fec-4a18-11e4-8de3-00144feab7de.html#axzz3JFnO|accessdate=24 November 2014|publisher=Financial Times|date=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new rules are expected to be combined with broader fiscal reforms aimed at bringing local government tax revenue in line with expenditure. The central government will provide more guidance to local governments in terms of how to manage and invest wisely.

As of 2017, China boasts the world’s second largest economy by nominal GDP at a staggering $11.8 trillion. It has the largest manufacturing economy in the world, and is the largest exporter of goods. China is also the world’s largest producer and consumer of agricultural products. Unsurprisingly, China produces the most rice in the world, and is a key producer of wheat, corn, tobacco, soybeans, and potatoes, among others. The real estate industry in China has been a controversial subject, but, since 2010, China has had the largest real estate market in the world. Despite China’s focus on manufacturing, in the last two decades, China’s service sector has doubled in size, accounting for 46% of China’s total GDP. In 2011, the Chinese government instituted a five-year plan to prioritize the development of the service economy. The telecommunications sub-sector in China is the largest in the world, with over a billion mobile customers. Tencent, the developer of WeChat, is dominating Chinese mobile culture unlike anything in history has.
In 2015, China contributed a third of global GDP growth. China’s influence in the global economy is a force to be reckoned with, and, as more and more Chinese citizens are becoming bigger consumers, it would be no surprise if this continues for the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name="internasia.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.internasia.com/asian-economies-powerhouses-potentials | title=Asian Economies: Powerhouses and potentials| date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic liberalisation in India===
The '''[[economic liberalisation in India]]''' refers to the ongoing economic liberalisation, initiated in 1991, of the country's economic policies, with the goal of making the economy more market-oriented and expanding the role of private and foreign investment. Specific changes include a reduction in import tariffs, deregulation of markets, reduction of taxes, and greater foreign investment. Liberalisation has been credited by its proponents for the high economic growth recorded by the country in the 1990s and 2000s. The overall direction of liberalisation has since remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has yet solved a variety of politically difficult issues, such as liberalising labour laws and reducing [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]].[1] There exists a lively debate in India as to what made the economic reforms sustainable.[2]

The '''[[Economy of India]]''' is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|sixth-largest]] in the world by [[gross domestic product|nominal GDP]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|third-largest]] by [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP).&lt;ref name=IMF_GDP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=79&amp;pr.y=7&amp;sy=2012&amp;ey=2015&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=534&amp;s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC&amp;grp=0&amp;a=|title=India|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is classified as a [[newly industrialized country]], one of the [[G-20 major economies]], a member of [[BRICS]] and a [[Developing country|developing economy]] with an average growth rate of approximately 7% over the last two decades. [[Maharashtra]] is the richest Indian state and has an annual GDP of US$320 billion, nearly equal to that of [[Pakistan]] or [[Portugal]], and accounts for 12% of the Indian GDP followed by the states of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. [[India]]'s economy became the world's fastest growing [[G20 major economies|major economy]] from the last quarter of 2014, replacing the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-india-clocks-75-growth-in-january-march-quarter-becomes-world-s-fastest-growing-economy-2090462 DNA, Indian economy overtaken china growth rate]&lt;/ref&gt;

The long-term growth prospective of the [[Indian economy]] is highly positive due to its young population, corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings and investment rates, and increasing integration into the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html CIA]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indian economy]] has the [[economic potential|potential]] to become the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|3rd-largest economy]] by the next decade, and one of the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economies]] by mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thediplomat.com/2015/02/china-india-to-lead-world-by-2050-says-pwc/ The diplomat]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141021025537-47732347-india-world-s-largest-economy-by-2050-citi-report The Linkedin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-04-13/news/61102759_1_global-economy-world-ranking-world-economy Times of India]&lt;/ref&gt; And the outlook for short-term growth is also good as according to the [[IMF]], the Indian economy is the "bright spot" in the global landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2015/car031115a.htm IMF,2015 Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; India also topped the [[World Bank]]’s growth outlook for 2015–16 for the first time with the economy having grown 7.3% in 2014–15 and expected to grow 7.5–8.3% in 2015-16.&lt;ref&gt;[https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/06/11/india-tops-world-banks-growth-outlook-for-first-time-bomb-attack-on-afghan-news-agency-deadly-week-for-quetta-police-force/ Foreign Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

India's two major stock exchanges, [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] and [[National Stock Exchange of India]], had a market capitalization of US$1.71 trillion and US$1.68 trillion respectively as of Feb 2015, which ranks [[List of stock exchanges|11th &amp; 12 largest]] in the world respectively according to the World Federation of Exchanges.&lt;ref name="bseindia.com"&gt;[http://www.bseindia.com/ BSE]&lt;/ref&gt; India also home to world's third largest Billionaires pool with 97 billionaires in 2014 and fourth largest number of ultra-high-net-worth households that have more than 100 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/economy/india-has-4th-largest-ultra-high-net-worth-households-report_129040.html ZeeNews]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-IRTB-28234 Wall Street Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

India is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]], the [[G20]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[New Development Bank|New Development BRICS Bank]].

Successive Indian governments have been advised to continue liberalisation. Even though, in early years India grew at slower pace than China (however, since 2013 India has been growing faster than its northern counterpart in terms of percentage of GDP growth, although it should be noted that China's absolute growth still exeeds India by a large margin). The McKinsey Quarterly states that removing main obstacles "would free India's economy to grow at 10% a year".

There has been significant debate, however, around liberalisation as an inclusive economic growth strategy. Since 1992, income inequality has deepened in India with consumption among the poorest staying stable while the wealthiest generate consumption growth. As India's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate became lowest in 2012–13 over a decade, growing merely at 5.1%,[6] more criticism of India's economic reforms surfaced, as it apparently failed to address employment growth, nutritional values in terms of food intake in calories, and also exports growth – and thereby leading to a worsening level of current account deficit compared to the prior to the reform period. But then in FY 2013–14 the growth rebounded to 6.9% and then in 2014–15 it rose to 7.3% as a result of the reforms put by the New Government which led to the economy becoming healthy again and the current account deficit coming in control. Growth reached 7.5% in the Jan–Mar quarter of 2015 before slowing to 7.0% in Apr–Jun quarter

By 2050, India’s economy is expected to overtake the US economy, putting it behind China in the world’s largest economies. Like China, agriculture makes up a large part of the Indian economy. As the Indian economy has grown, agriculture’s contribution to GDP has steadily declined, but it still makes up a large portion of the workforce and socio-economic development. India’s industrial manufacturing GDP output was the 6th largest in the world in 2015, largely due to petroleum products and chemicals. India’s pharmaceutical industry has also grown at a compound annual growth rate of 17.5% over the last 11 years, and is one of India’s fastest-growing sub-sectors today. However, the engineering industry in India is still the largest sub-sector by GDP.
Perhaps the most exciting development in India is its incredibly fast-growing information technology and business process outsourcing sub-sector. Cities like [[Bangalore]], [[Hyderabad]] rival the United States’s Silicon Valley in innovation and technological advancement as more and more skilled, tech-savvy students and young professionals are entering the entrepreneurial world.&lt;ref name="internasia.com"/&gt;

===Abenomics in Japan===
[[Abenomics]] is a policy named after, and implemented by the Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]].  Following the [[great recession|global economic recession]], the Prime Minister hoped to boost Japanese economy with "three arrows": massive fiscal stimulus, more aggressive monetary easing and structural reforms to make Japan more competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining Abenomics|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=abenomics|website=Financial Times|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stimulus package was 20.2 trillion yen ($210 billion) and the government also aimed to create 600,000 jobs in two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu|first1=Beina|title=Abenomics and the Japanese Economy|url=http://www.cfr.org/japan/abenomics-japanese-economy/p30383|website=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bank of Japan also aimed to raise [[inflation]] to 2% in part by buying up short-term government debts. Critics point out that hyperinflation and an unbalanced GDP/debt ration could be negative results of Abenomics.  Furthermore, currency changes could aggravate international relations, especially those between China and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/japan/abenomics-japanese-economy/p30383|title=Abenomics and the Japanese Economy|work=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement===
The [[Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement]] (APTA), formerly called the Bangkok Agreement, is the only trade agreement bringing together China and India, in addition to Bangladesh and the Republic of Korea, among others. The Secretariat of the agreement is provided by the United Nations [[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP). While the agreement covers only a limited number of products, members agreed in 2009 to implement a Trade Facilitation Framework Agreement aimed at streamlining trade procedures between members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement|url=http://www.unescap.org/apta|website=United Nations: ESCAP|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation===
The [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) is a group of [[Pacific Rim]] countries who meet with the purpose of improving economic and political ties. Although the initial intention was to create a free trade area covering all membership (which includes China, the United States and Australia, among others) this has failed to materialize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About APEC|url=http://www.apec.org/About-Us/About-APEC.aspx|website=Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, APEC members committed to taking a concrete step towards greater regional economic integration by endorsing a roadmap for the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) to translate this vision into a reality.  As a first step, APEC is implementing a strategic study on issues related to the realization of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. The study will provide an analysis of potential economic and social benefits and costs, analyze the various pathways towards a Free Trade Area and identify challenges economies may face in realizing this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apec.org/about-us/about-apec/fact-sheets/regional-economic-integration-agenda.aspx | title=Regional Economic Integration Agenda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gulf Cooperation Council===
The [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC), is a regional intergovernmental political and economic union founded in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Objectives |url= http://www.gcc-sg.org/en-us/AboutGCC/Pages/StartingPointsAndGoals.aspx |website= GCC-SG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current member states of GCC are [[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[the United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= GCC-Member-States |url= http://www.gcc-sg.org/en-us/AboutGCC/MemberStates |website= GCC-SG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement===
The [[Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement|Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement]] (CEPA) is an economic agreement between the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong SAR government (signed on 29 June 2003), and the [[Macau]] SAR government (signed on 18 October 2003), in order to promote trade and investment facilitation.

The main aims of CEPA are to eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barrier on substantially all the trade in goods between the three, and achieve liberalization of trade in services through reduction or elimination of substantially all discriminatory measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA)|url=http://www.tid.gov.hk/english/cepa/cepa_overview.html|website=Trade and Industry Department|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab League===
The [[Arab League]] is an association of [[Arab]] countries in Africa and Asia. The [[Arab League]] facilitates political, economic, cultural, scientific and social programs designed to promote the interests of its member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presentation of the Arab League|url=http://www.arableagueonline.org/|website=Arab League Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commonwealth of Independent States===
[[File:Flag of the CIS.svg|thumb|right|150px|Flag of the Commonwealth of Independent States]]
The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) is a confederation consisting of 12 of the 15 states of the former Soviet Union, both Asian and European (the exceptions being the three [[Baltic states]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Commonwealth of Independent States|url=http://www.cisstat.com/eng/cis.htm|publisher=Interstate Statistical Committee of the Commonwealth of Independent States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is more than a purely symbolic organization and possesses coordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking and security. The most significant issue for the CIS is the establishment of a full-fledged free trade zone / economic union between the member states, to be launched in 2005. It has also promoted cooperation on democratisation and cross-border crime prevention.

===South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation===
The [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) is an association of eight countries of South Asia, namely [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and, [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|url=http://www.saarc-sec.org/SAARC-Charter/5/|website=South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries comprise an area of 5,130,746&amp;nbsp;km² and a fifth of the  world population.
SAARC encourages cooperation in agriculture, rural development, science and technology, culture, health, population control, narcotics control and anti-terrorism.
Also , a FTA called [[South Asia Free Trade Agreement]] was reached at the 12th [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] summit. It created a framework for the creation of a [[free trade]] zone covering 1.6 billion people of member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AGREEMENT ON SOUTH ASIAN FREE TRADE AREA (SAFTA)|url=http://www.saarc-sec.org/userfiles/saftaagreement.pdf|website=Asia Regional Integration Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic sectors==

===Primary sector===
Asia is by a considerable margin the largest continent in the world, and is rich in natural resources. The vast expanse of the former [[Soviet Union]], particularly that of [[Russia]], contains a huge variety of metals, such as [[gold]], [[iron]], [[lead]], [[titanium]], [[uranium]], and [[zinc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mining in Russia and CIS|url=http://www.infomine.com/countries/soir/russia/|website=CountryMine|accessdate=25 November 2014|date=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These metals are mined, but inefficiently due to the control of a few state-sponsored giants that make participation difficult for many international mining companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuepper|first1=Justin|title=A Deeper Look At Russia's Commodity Industry|url=http://commodityhq.com/2013/a-deeper-look-at-russias-commodity-industry/|website=Commodity HQ|accessdate=25 November 2014|date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, profits are high due to a [[2000s commodities boom|commodity price boom]] in 2003/2004 caused largely by increased demand in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallagher|first1=Kevin|last2=Porzecanski|first2=Roberto|title=China and the Latin America Commodities Boom:  A Critical Assessment|journal=Political Economy Research Institute|date=February 2009|issue=129|pages=1–27|url=http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/pubs/rp/perikgrp.pdf|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil is Southwest Asia's most important natural resource. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait are rich in oil reserves and have benefited from recent oil price escalations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/index.cfm?view=reserves|website=U.S. Energy Information Administration|accessdate=25 November 2014|title=International - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Terrace field yunnan china denoised.jpg|thumb|[[Terrace (agriculture)|Terraced]] [[Paddy field|Paddy]] field in [[Yunnan]], [[China]] ]]

Asia is home to some four billion people, and thus has a well established tradition in agriculture.  High productivity in agriculture, especially of [[rice]], allows high population density of many countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, southern China, Cambodia, India, and Vietnam.  Agriculture constitutes a high portion of land usage in warm and humid areas of Asia.

Many hillsides are farmed in a ''terrace'' method to boost arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrace Cultivation|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/588178/terrace-cultivation|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main agricultural products in Asia include [[rice]] and [[wheat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asia: Agriculture|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/38479/Asia/48226/Agriculture|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Opium]] is one of major cash crops in Central and Southeast Asia, particularly in Afghanistan, though its production is prohibited everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug Trafficking|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/drug-trafficking/central-asia.html|website=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forestry is extensive throughout Asia, with many of the items of furniture sold in the developed nations made out of Asian timber. More than half of the forested land in Asia is in China, Indonesia, and Malaysia. China is considered a top exporter of wood products like paper and wood furniture while tropical timbers are a top export in Malaysia and Indonesia. Fishing is a major source of food, particularly in Japan and China. In Japan larger, high-quality fish are common while in China, smaller fish are being consumed at a higher rate. As the middle-class population in Southeast Asia expands, there is an increase of more expensive meats and foods becoming a part of the traditional diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asia: Resources Environment and Economy|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/asia-resources/?ar_a=1|website=National Geographic|accessdate=24 November 2014|date=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary sector===
The manufacturing sector in Asia has traditionally been strongest in the East Asia region—particularly in China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.&lt;ref name="gaatw.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pattanaik|first1=Bandana|last2=Dewar|first2=Fleur|last3=Ham|first3=Julie|last4=Bake-Paterson|first4=Zoë|title=Asia: The Changing Context of Trafficking and Migration|journal=Alliance News|date=December 2009|issue=32|page=6|url=http://www.gaatw.org/publications/Alliance%20News/2009/Alliance_News_Dec09.pdf|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry varies from manufacturing cheap low value goods such as [[toy]]s to high-tech value added goods such as [[computer]]s, [[CD player]]s, [[games console]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and [[automobile|cars]]. Major Asian manufacturing companies are mostly based in either South Korea or Japan. They include [[Samsung]], [[Hyundai]], [[LG Corporation|LG]], and [[Kia Motors|Kia]] from South Korea, and [[Sony]], [[Toyota]], [[Toshiba]], and [[Honda]] from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Kevin|title=Asian Companies Need a Brand New Start|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/45fc6fca-c591-11df-ab48-00144feab49a.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3K6VJw4pY|accessdate=25 November 2014|publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many developed-nation firms from Europe, North America, Japan and South Korea have significant operations in developing Asia to take advantage of the abundant supply of cheap labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asia|url=http://wikipedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major employers in manufacturing in Asia is the [[textile]] industry. Much of the world's supply of clothing and footwear now originates in Southeast Asia and South Asia, particularly in Vietnam, China, India, Thailand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia.&lt;ref name="gaatw.org"/&gt;

===Tertiary sector===
[[File:Tidel Park.jpg|thumb|250px|A view of the [[Tidel Park]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. Software industries of late, have been outsourced to Asian cities as such for good infrastructure, efficient man-power and cheap labour.]]

Asia's top ten important financial centers are located in [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[Tokyo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Beijing]], [[Dubai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Osaka]], [[Seoul]], [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name=GFCI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longfinance.net/images/gfci/gfci_22.pdf|title=The Global Financial Centres Index 22|date=September 2017|publisher=Long Finance}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has been one of the greatest beneficiaries of the economic boom.

Experts believe that the current center of financial activity is moving toward "[[Chindia]]" – a name used for jointly referring to China and India – with [[Shanghai]] and [[Mumbai]] becoming major financial hubs in their own right.

Other growing technological and financial hubs include [[Dhaka]] (Bangladesh), [[Chennai]] (India), [[New Delhi]] (India), [[Pune]] (India), [[Bangalore]] (India), [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]] (India), [[Shenzhen]] (China), [[Kolkata]] (India), [[Jakarta]] (Indonesia), [[Kuala Lumpur]] (Malaysia), [[Lahore]] (Pakistan), [[Metro Manila]] (Philippines), [[Cebu]] (Philippines) and [[Bangkok]] (Thailand).

The '''emblem of the [[African Union]]''' features a golden, boundary-less map of [[Africa]] inside two concentric circles, with stylised  [[Palm tree|palm leaves]] shooting up on either side of the outer circle.

Although when the AU was formed, a competition was announced for designing a new emblem and flag, the Assembly of the African Union decided at the Addis Ababa session of 2004 to retain the emblem and flag of its predecessor, the [[Organisation of African Unity]], and adopt them as the new AU flag and emblem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.africa-union.org/AU%20summit%202004/Assm/Assembly%20Decisions%20-Final.pdf |title=Assembly of the African Union: Third Ordinary Session, 6–8 July 2004, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia }}, p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
The palm leaves stand for peace. The [[gold]] circle symbolises [[Africa]]'s wealth and bright future, while the green [[circle]] represents African hopes and aspiration for unity. The map of Africa, without boundaries, signifies African unity, while a series of small interlocking red rings at the base of the emblem stand for African solidarity and the blood shed for the [[decolonisation of Africa|liberation of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.int/web/en/about/symbols African Union Symbols], AU website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag of [[Belgrade]]''' is composed of three [[Serbia]]n national [[colour]]s: red, blue and white. The blue symbolises [[hope]] and faith in better future. The red of the ground is a symbol of the suffering of Serbian people in a struggle for freedom. Two horizontal white lines represent the Sava and Danube rivers, which are symbols of the strength of Belgrade. They are white according to [[heraldry]] rules. "Beograd" is Serbian name for "white city," so there are white walls and towers. The walls represent a merchant city; the towers and open gate represent an open market. The ship, a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[trireme]], is a symbol of the antiquity of the city.

The flag is a banner of the [[Coat of arms of Belgrade|arms of Belgrade]].

The '''Frischauf Lodge at Okrešelj''' ({{lang-sl|Frischaufov dom na Okrešlju}}; {{convert|1378|m|ft|disp=or|sp=us}}) is a mountain lodge that stands above the [[Logar Valley (Slovenia)|Logar Valley]] in northern [[Slovenia]]. It is surrounded by the following peaks: [[Cold Mountain (Slovenia)|Cold Mountain]] ({{lang|sl|Mrzla gora}}), [[Styria Mount Rinka]] ({{lang|sl|Štajerska Rinka}}), [[Carinthia Mount Rinka]] ({{lang|sl|Koroška Rinka}}), and [[Mount Turska]] ({{lang|sl|Turska gora}}). Nearby is {{convert|80|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Rinka Falls]]. The lodge is named after [[Johannes Frischauf]], and the first lodge was built in 1876 by an Austro-German hiking club. In 1907 it was destroyed by an avalanche and rebuilt again in 1908. In 1991 it was expanded and modernized.

'''''Furst Gabriel or Last Days of the Pirita Monastery'''''  ({{lang-et|'''Vürst Gabriel ehk Pirita kloostri viimsed päevad'''}}) is an [[Estonia]]n historical novelle by [[Eduard Bornhöhe]].

This historical story, first published in 1893, is the last of [[Eduard Bornhöhe]]'s historical novelles, as in 1893, the Russian Empire's [[censorship]] prohibited publication of historical novelles, fearing it might cause too strong [[patriotism|patriotic]] feelings in provincial regions.

The story is set during a [[Livonian War]] era peasant uprising.  A central plot device is a [[Catholic]] [[nunnery]] dedicated to [[St. Brigitta]] (see [[Pirita monastery]]).  The monastery's medieval buildings are currently in [[ruins]] and considered a [[museum]]; however, the organisational structure was restored after end of [[Soviet occupation]].

While other major historical novelles by [[Eduard Bornhöhe]] have been included in lists of mandatory reading by Soviet authorities, this book was usually considered too long for that, and thus, it's mostly known through its extremely popular 1969 movie adaptation, ''[[Viimne reliikvia]]'' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]] for ''The last relic'') directed by [[Grigori Kromanov]] and adapted by [[Arvo Valton]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1326">'''Hule Mill Farm''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: Hule Møllegård) is a watermill situated a few kilometres to the southwest of [[Ledreborg]], in [[Lejre Municipality]], some 30 kilometres west of [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It was powered by a tributary of Kornerup Å.

==History==
Hule Møllegård traces its history back to the beginning of the 18th century. It was originally a three-winged complex but two of the wings have been demolished.&lt;ref name=Kulturstyrelsen&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/fbb/sagvis.pub?sag=7226385|title=Sag: Hule Møllegård|publisher=Kulturstyrelsen|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The surviving main wing is built in brick with dressed, half-timbered gables. The [[hip roof]] is thatched with straw and has several thatched dormer windows.

The stream runs in a pipe under the cobbled yard in front of the building. The site also comprises a ditch and a bridge across the [[mill pond]] to the west of the building.

'''Højbrohus''' is an [[Art Nouveau]]-style building situated on the east side of [[Amagertorv]], between [[Strøget|Østergade]] and Store Kirkestræde, in the Old Town of [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It houses Café Norden in the two lower floors and a Hay flagship store on the second floor.

==History==
[[File:Østergade-Amagertorv corner.png|thumb|left|The building that was constructed after the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1795|Fire of 1795]] and that was demolished when Højbrohus was built]] 
Store Lækkerbidsken, a hotel, was built at the site in 1656. It developed into the leading place of accommodation in the city. The building was destroyedin the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1795]]. A new building with seven shops in the ground floor was completed at the site shortly thereafter, It became known as Peter Egholm's House (Isenkræmmer Peter Egholms
Gaard) after one of its owners..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dengang.dk/artikler/2493|title=Dengang på Strøget
|language=Danish|website=dengang.dk|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Screenshot (79).png|thumb|Højbrohus seen on an old advertisement]] 
It was demolished in the mid-190+s to make was for the current building, Højbrohus, which was built in 1896 to design by Richard Bergmann (1860-1925).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indenforvoldene.dk/oestergade-61|title=Østergade 61|language=Danish|website=indenforvoldene.dk|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Højbrohus is built to an [[Art Nouveau]]-inspired design with many decorative details. A facade towards Amagertorv has a [[Dutch gable]]. The projecting central bay finishes in an onion domed spire, creating a tower-link silhouette against the rest of the building. The central "tower" is flanked by smaller, onion-domed [[turret]]s at the corners.  The facade towards Amagertorv is also decorated with several relieds and other ornamental details. 

The facades towards Østergade features a smaller Dutch gable as well as many other decorative details.

==Today==
Cafe Norden occupies the two lower floors of the building. Hay House, a Gay flagship store, is located on the second floor (Østergade 61)

[[File:Kermadec Arc.jpg|300px|thumb|Map of the Kermadec Trench and [[Tonga Trench]], north of New Zealand, near [[Fiji]], [[Tonga]] and [[American Samoa]].  To its immediate west lies the [[Kermadec Ridge]], which is separated by the nearly parallel [[Colville Ridge]] by the [[Havre Trough]] and [[Lau Basin]].]]
The '''Kermadec Trench''' is a linear [[ocean trench]] in the south [[Pacific Ocean]].  It stretches about {{Convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Louisville Ridge|Louisville Seamount Chain]] in the north (26°S) to the [[Hikurangi Plateau]] in the south (37°S), north-east of [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]].&lt;ref name="BilGur-p9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Billen|Gurnis|2005|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[Tonga Trench]] to the north, it forms the {{Convert|2000|km|abbr=on}}-long, near-linear [[Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone|Kermadec-Tonga subduction system]], which began to evolve in the Eocene when the Pacific Plate started to subduct beneath the Australian Plate.  Convergence rates along this subduction system are among the fastest on Earth, {{Convert|80|mm|abbr=on}}/yr in the north and {{Convert|45|mm|abbr=on}}/yr in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stratford|Peirce|Paulatto|Funnell|2015|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
It is one of Earth's deepest oceanic trenches, reaching a depth of {{convert|10047|m}}. Formed by the subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]] under the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], it runs parallel with and to the east of the [[Kermadec Ridge]] and [[island arc]]. The [[Tonga Trench]] marks the continuation of subduction to the north.

The Kermadec Trench has a southern continuation in the [[turbidite]]-filled [[Hikurangi Trough]], but a series of seamounts on the Australian Plate act as a dam and prevent this turbidity from reaching the sediment-starved Kermadec Trench. Debris from a larger subducted seamount probably dammed the trench from 2&amp;nbsp;Ma to 0.5&amp;nbsp;Ma and similar events probably redirected sediments in similar ways before that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|Collot|Lallem|1998|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two oceanic plates meet at the Kermadec Trench which is located far from any larger landmass. Because of this, the Pacific Plate as well as the trench itself is only covered by {{Circa}} {{Convert|200|m|abbr=on}} of sediments. The trench is almost perfectly straight and its simple geometry is the result of the uniformity of the subducting sea-floor. This sea-floor formed at the extinct Osbourn Trough, an abandoned spreading centre located just north of the Louisville Seamount Chain. Abyssal hills on the subducting sea-floor are oriented perpendicular to the old spreading centre and the sea-floor is 72–80&amp;nbsp;Ma near the Louisville seamounts at the northern end and more than 100&amp;nbsp;Ma near Hikurangi Plateau at the southern end. There are no seamounts on the sea-floor near the Kermadec Trench except one sitting on the trench slope at {{Coord|31.50|S|176.45|W|display=inline}} which has been dated to 54.8±1.9&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name="BilGur-p9" /&gt;

The Hikurangi Plateau formed part of the [[Ontong Java Plateau|Ontong-Java]]-[[Manihiki Plateau|Manihiki]]-Hikurangi [[large igneous province]] (LIP) during the so-called Greater Ontong Java Event 120&amp;nbsp;{{Abbr|Ma|million year ago}}. The Manihiki Plateau is currently subducting under the southern part of the Kermadec Arc but most of it has already been subducted. The LIP-arc collision occurred {{Convert|250|km|abbr=on}} north of its present location, but oblique plate convergence has migrated the subducted plateau southward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Timm|Davy|Haase|Hoernle|2014|loc=Abstract; p. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
In 2012, deep sea researchers discovered individuals of a species of [[Alicella|giant amphipod]] at the trench's lowest depths.&lt;ref name = "Morelle"&gt;{{cite web| last = Morelle | first = Rebecca | title = 'Supergiant' crustacean found in deepest ocean| publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2 February 2012| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16834913| accessdate = 13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most [[amphipod]]s, which are approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (1 inch) long, this species reaches up to 34&amp;nbsp;cm (13 inches) in length, and are milky-white.&lt;ref name = "Morelle"/&gt;

The second-deepest fish, the [[Hadal zone|hadal]] snailfish ''[[Notoliparis kermadecensis]]'', is endemic to the trench and occupies a very limited depth range, {{Convert|6472|to|7561|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yancey|Gerringer|Drazen|Rowden|2014|loc=Significance; Fig. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A species of [[pearlfish]], ''[[Echiodon|Echiodon neotes]]'', has been caught in the Kermadec Trench at a depth of {{Convert|8200|-|8300|m|abbr=on}}.  All other known pearlfishes live in the range {{convert|1800|-|2000|m|abbr=on}} and the presence of ''E. neotes'' at this depth remains unexplained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fujii|Jamieson|Solan|Bagley|2010|

==''Nereus'' research submarine==
In May 2014, the [[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|''Nereus'']], an unmanned research submarine operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] (WHOI), imploded due to high pressure at a depth of 9,990 metres while exploring the Kermadec Trench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/05/12/nereus-unmanned-research-sub-suffers-catastrophic-implosion-nearly-10-kilometres-underwater/ |title=Nereus, unmanned research sub, suffers 'catastrophic implosion' nearly 10 kilometres underwater |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=12 May 2014 |work=[[National Post]] |location=Toronto |accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1913">The '''Kyiv Chamber Choir''' ({{lang-uk|Камерний хор "Київ"}}) is a [[chamber choir]] based in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. The choir was founded in December 1990 by conductor [[Mykola Hobdych]]. It has performed thousands of concerts in at least 21 countries. The choir also records music, releasing over 40 compact disks. More than half of these compositions were recorded for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parafia.org.ua/choir/kamernyj-hor-kyjiv/ Камерний хор «Київ» (Chamber choir "Kyiv")] Profile on parafia.org {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choir has performed at renowned American venues such as [[Carnegie Hall]], the [[National Cathedral]], and the [[White House]]. The choir sings much of its music [[a cappella]]. Its repertoire includes well-known classical compositions, but also that of [[List of Ukrainian composers|Ukrainian composers]] such as [[Mykola Lysenko]], [[Mykola Leontovych]], [[Kyrylo Stetsenko]], [[Artem Vedel]], and [[Mykola Diletsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1997/529701.shtml Kyiv Chamber Choir performs at White House] Article by Yaro Bihun for [[The Ukrainian Weekly]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kyiv Chamber Choir has done well in international choral competitions. These include first prizes in the 1st Schumann International Choral Competition in [[Zwickau]] in [[Germany]], the 12th International competition of Choir Music in [[Poland]], the 7th international Choirs Competition at [[Sligo]] in [[Ireland]], and a second prize in Choir of the Year Competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magnatune.com/artists/kyiv_chamber_choir Kyiv Chamber Choir: chants of the Russian Orthodox Church.] Profile on [[Magnatune]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These  lists of '''historical unrecognized or partially recognized ''states''''' or '''''governments''''' give an overview of extinct [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] entities that wished to be recognized as  [[sovereign state]]s, but did not enjoy worldwide [[diplomatic recognition]]. The entries listed here had ''de facto'' control over their claimed territory and were self-governing with a desire for full independence; or if they lacked such control over their territory, they were recognized by at least one other recognized nation.

== Criteria for inclusion ==
The criteria for inclusion in this list are similar to those of the [[list of states with limited recognition]]. To be included here, a polity must have claimed [[Nation-state|statehood]], has not had recognition by at least one widely accepted state for a significant portion of its ''de facto'' existence, and either:

* had a population and an organized government with a capacity to enter into relations with other states; or
* had ''de facto'' control over a territory or a significant portion of the territory of an otherwise-recognized sovereign state

=== Africa ===
The total number of countries in the African continent is unknown due to the instability throughout the region. At present there are 54 sovereign countries and around 90 countries, territories and regions not recognized by the UN. One needs to take into account the fact that some countries are independent nations, and while they have geopolitical borders they are protectorates or territories (for example the Islands of [[St. Helena]]). Also, certain parts of Africa have a tendency towards political instability (more so than other continents); this means that from time to time countries split, merge and are renamed. Some examples include: The Republic of South Sudan, Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana and Burkina Faso. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African states are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of coups, producing military dictatorships.

Great instability was mainly the result of marginalization of ethnic groups, and graft under these leaders. For political gain, many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.

A variety of causes have been blamed for Africa's political instability, including Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union, over-reliance on foreign aid,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dambisa Moyo]] (2009). Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa. Farrar, Straus and Giroux&lt;/ref&gt; decades of corruption and mismanagement by socialist leaders,&lt;ref&gt;"Africa’s crisis is of modern socialist making and stems from the misrule, mismanagement and corruption of the elite." "[https://fee.org/resources/betrayal-why-socialism-failed-in-africa/ Betrayal: Why Socialism Failed in Africa]," adapted from a speech economist [[George Ayittey]] delivered at “Evenings at FEE” in April 2005; accessed 01 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the policies of the International Monetary Fund.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}  When a country became independent for the first time, it would often align itself with one of the two superpowers in order to get support. Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while many in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation, as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by funding insurgency movements. There was a major famine in Ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist/Soviet policies made the situation worse. The most devastating military conflict in modern independent Africa has been the Second Congo War; this conflict and its aftermath have killed an estimated 5.5 million people.[66] Since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in Darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. Another notable tragic event is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. AIDS in post-colonial Africa has also been a prevalent issue.

In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the civil war in Angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from China, which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2011. A significant part of this growth can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile phone.

A few months after Rigaud seized power, he died, and South Haiti rejoined the Republic. In 1820, Henry Christophe committed suicide. [[Haiti]] was reunited soon afterwards.

Arguing that [[Rotuma]] had been ceded to [[Great Britain]] and not to Fiji, these rebels declared in 1987 independence of Republic of Rotuma and were charged with sedition. It did not have any substantive support, majority opinion appears to favor remaining with Fiji, but rumblings of discontent remain.

'''Loerrach International''' e.V. (registered society) is an association of citizens, educational, sport and cultural institutions, service clubs, municipal administration and local council in [[Lörrach]] in southwestern Germany. It has the goal of fostering relations with the town‘s partner towns. Its structure has long been a model for similar town partnership organisations in other European cities.

==Foundation and Function==
At the suggestion of [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Konrad Adenauer]] the then mayor of Loerrach [[Egon Hugenschmidt]] founded the first partnership with [[Sens]] in [[France]] in 1966. Under mayor [[Rainer Offergeld]] the partnership with [[Senigallia]] in [[Italy]] followed and in 1986 and under mayor [[Gudrun Heute-Bluhm]] in 2003 with [[Chester]] in [[England]]. Further partnerships have been established with [[Meerane]] in [[Saxony]], [[Vyshhorod]] in the [[Ukraine]] und [[Lubliniec]] in [[Silesia]]. A special feature is the friendship with [[Edirne]] in [[Turkey]], which arose from a citizens‘ initiative.

Loerrach International was founded by Gudrun Heute-Bluhm as President and [[Manfred G. Raupp]] as Chairman on the 22nd of September 2004. The various fractions in the city council were each asked to nominate a representative and a deputy to the extended board of the society. 

== Working groups ==

Working groups were set up for Sens, Senigallia, Chester, Meerane, and Eastern Europe, and the youth organisation SAK Lörrach, the town band, its schools (Hans-Thoma-Gymnasium Lörrach, Phaenovum Schülerforschungszentrum Lörrach-Dreiländereck) and the technical college DHBW Loerrach, sport and culture organisations and service clubs were invited to collaborate.
On his election to mayor in 2014 [[Jörg Lutz]] became ex officio president of the society. In September 2016 Susanne Daniel succeeded Manfred Raupp as chairperson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loerrach.de/739?view=publish&amp;item=article&amp;id=4842 Susanne Daniel neue Vorsitzende von Lörrach International]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badische-zeitung.de/loerrach/partnerstaedte-kommen-zum-fruehlingsfest--135797068.html Vertreter der Partnerstädte kommen zum Frühlingsfest]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verlagshaus-jaumann.de/inhalt.loerrach-ende-der-aera-manfred-raupp.8ba1c6ba-c7fd-4419-bf7a-23dfa8161880.html Ende der Aera Manfred Raupp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the society‘s foundation around 50 events involving the partner towns take place every year., the majority involving schools and youth groups from the partner towns.

== Structure ==
The structure of the society brings together interested citizens, educational institutions, the local council and city administration. The president is ex officio the current mayor and the secretarial duties of the management committee is the responsibility of the representatives of the various town partnerships, but all other activities are carried out on a voluntary basis by those elected by the approximately 140 members.

The '''Greater Malayan Confederation''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/library/connections.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013055904/http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/library/connections.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Maphilindo''' (for [[Federation of Malaya|'''Ma'''laysia]], the [[Philippines|'''Phil'''ippines]], and [[Indonesia|'''Indo'''nesia]]), was a proposed, nonpolitical [[confederation]] of the three [[Southeast Asia]]n countries.

==Background==
The original plan for a united state based on the concept of the [[Malay race]] was attempted by [[Wenceslao Vinzons]] during the Philippines' [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth Era]]. Vinzons had envisioned a united Malay race which he termed '''Malaya [[Irredentism|Irredenta]]''' (later another name for the union). In his 1959 book ''Someday, Malaysia'', Major Eduardo Abdul Latif Martelino (later operations officer in the infamous  [[Jabidah massacre]]) also cited the vision of then-[[President of the Philippines]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]] for an integrated, pan-Malayan nationhood in the region.

==History==
Maphilindo was initially proposed as a realisation of [[National hero of the Philippines|Filipino national hero]] Dr. [[José Rizal]] dream of uniting the Malay peoples, seen as artificially divided by [[Colonialism|colonial]] frontiers. In July 1963, Quezon's later successor, President [[Diosdado Macapagal]], convened a summit in [[Manila]] where the three countries signed [[Manila Accord|a series of agreements]] to resolve controversies over the former British colonies of [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]] and [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]] joining Malaysia.

While the union was described as a regional association that would approach issues of common concern, it was also perceived as a tactic employed by the Philippines and Indonesia to hinder the formation of the [[Federation of Malaysia]] as Malaya's [[successor state]]. The Philippines had its own [[North Borneo dispute#Philippine claim|claim over]] the eastern part of [[Sabah]] (formerly [[British North Borneo]]), while Indonesia protested the formation of Malaysia as a [[British imperialism|British imperialist]] plot.

The union was dismantled a month later&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weatherbee|first=Donald E.|author2=Ralf Emmers |author3=Mari Pangestu |author4=Leonard C. Sebastian |title=International relations in Southeast Asia|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2005|pages=68–69|isbn=0-7425-2842-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wqEC4jHl9wC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=malaysia+philippines+relations#PPA69,M1|accessdate=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Sukarno]], [[President of Indonesia]], adopted a policy of ''[[Konfrontasi]]'' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], "confrontation") with the newly constituted Malaysia. The aim of the Konfrontasi was to prevent Malaysia from achieving full sovereignty, and was introduced to President Sukarno by the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] or PKI. The PKI had convinced President Sukarno that the formation of Malaysia was a form of neo-colonisation that will later affect Indonesian stability.

In [[international taxation]], a '''physical presence test''' is a rule used to determine [[tax residence]] of a natural or legal person. It may rely on having a place of business in the jurisdiction (for legal persons), or remaining in or out of the jurisdiction for a certain number of days each year (for natural persons).

==Australia==
The "physical presence in Australia test" is one of the three tests under [[Australian law]] through which a charitable institution may be entitled to the income tax exempt charity endorsement; the others are the "[[deductible gift recipient]] test" and the "prescribed by law" test. The two elements of the test are whether the institution has a physical presence in Australia (wholly or through a division, branch, or subdivision) and whether or not the expenditures of institution are incurred principally in Australia. An institution may still qualify even if its expenditure is not incurred principally in Australia, provided that the amounts expended elsewhere are less than "disregarded amounts" (comprising gifts, proceeds from fundraising activities and government grants).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ato.gov.au/nonprofit/content.aspx?menuid=0&amp;doc=/content/34308.htm&amp;page=5&amp;H5&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
The South Africa Income Tax Act (No. 58 of 1962) in Section 1 defines a natural person as a "tax resident" if he is either ordinarily resident in [[South Africa]], or meets the physical presence test. A natural person meets the physical presence test if he is present for more than 91 days during the year of assessment as well as a more than 91 days in each of  the five preceding years, or if he was present for more than 915 days in aggregate in the preceding five years. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sars.gov.za/ClientSegments/Individuals/Learn-About-Taxes/Pages/Non-Residents.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; However, a person who is absent from South Africa for more than 330 days following his previous day of presence will be deemed not to have been a tax resident since that day. Furthermore, a person who meets the physical presence test may still be deemed not to be a tax resident of South Africa if he is a tax resident of a country with which South Africa has a [[tax treaty]] for the avoidance of [[double taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sars.gov.za/Tools/Documents/DocumentDownload.asp?FileID=65435&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The [[United States]] uses a physical presence test both when determining eligibility of US citizens and permanent residents for favorable tax treatment for not being physically present in the US and conversely when determining when people who are not citizens or permanent residents are subject to US taxation. The former is covered in this section; the latter is covered in the article on the [[Substantial Presence Test]].

===Overview===
One of the ways for US taxpayers to qualify for the [[foreign earned income exclusion]] is by passing the physical presence test.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p54/index.html IRS Publication 54 (2011)] IRS Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad.&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting the test requires the taxpayer to reside in another country, living or working, for more than 329 full (24-hour) days in a 12-month period, including days spent in other foreign countries. An exception is available in the event of war or civil unrest that causes the taxpayer to leave.

A less-than-24-hour visit to the US during travel between two points outside the U.S does not count as a break in a foreign stay.

===Determination of 12-month period===
Four rules determine a 12-month period for the purposes of the physical presence test:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Foreign-Earned-Income-Exclusion---Physical-Presence-Test Foreign Earned Income Exclusion - Physical Presence Test]&lt;/ref&gt;
# A 12-month period must be made up of consecutive months.
# A 12-month period can begin on any day of any month.
# The period does not begin until the first full day abroad.
# The 12-month periods may overlap.

A person who is present in the United States rather than abroad may still meet the physical presence test under the war and civil unrest exception. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] publishes a list of countries that qualify under the war/civil unrest exception and the respective dates during which the waiver applies.

Conversely, days spent in a foreign country by a person who is present there in violation of a US ban on travel to that country do not qualify for meeting the physical presence test (or the bona fide residence test). Income earned there does not qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion, and housing expenditures incurred there do not qualify for the foreign housing deduction. As of 2010, the only country in this category was [[Cuba]] (except the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay corrections facility]].)

===Foreign earned income===
Income earned abroad may qualify for the [[foreign earned income exclusion]], the [[foreign housing exclusion]] or deduction, as long as the income is earned in the taxpayer's tax home and the taxpayer meets either the [[bona fide resident test]] or the physical presence test.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p54/ch04.html#en_US_2011_publink100047432 Foreign Earned Income and Housing: Exclusion – Deduction] IRS Publication 54 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The income requirements for US ctizens and [[resident aliens]] living abroad are the same. However, foreign earned income may qualify for some amount of exclusion. One is to subtract the amounts that are estimated from the [[foreign earned income exclusion]]. Tax obligations may be reduced by subtracting the [[foreign housing exclusion]] but only from non-excluded income by using tax rates that would apply if the income were included.

In a vaguely surreal story, an extraordinary little girl is born from strange circumstances - her mother murdered her father, gave birth in prison, and then hanged herself.

'''''The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time''''' ({{ISBN|1-59420-045-9}}) is a 2005 book by American economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]].  It was a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' [[New York Times Best Seller list|bestseller]].

In the book, Sachs argues that [[extreme poverty]]—defined by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] as incomes of less than one dollar per day—can be eliminated globally by the year 2025, through carefully planned [[development aid]]. He presents the problem as an inability of very poor countries to reach the "bottom rung" of the ladder of [[economic development]]; once the bottom rung is reached, a country can pull itself up into the global [[market economy]], and the need for outside aid will be greatly diminished or eliminated.

==Clinical economics==
In order to address and remedy the specific economic stumbling blocks of various countries, Sachs espouses the use of what he terms "clinical economics", by analogy to [[medicine]]. Sachs explains that countries, like patients, are complex systems, requiring [[differential diagnosis]], an understanding of context, monitoring and evaluation, and professional standards of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, ''The End of Poverty'', 288&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical economics requires a methodic analysis and "differential kapay" of a country's economic problems, followed by a specifically tailored prescription.  Many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.  Sachs discusses each factor, and its potential remedies, in turn.

In order to illustrate the use of clinical economics, Sachs presents case studies on [[Bolivia]], Poland, and Russia, and discusses the solutions he presented to those countries, and their effects.  The book also discusses the economies of [[Malawi]], India, China, and [[Bangladesh]] as representative of various stages of economic development.

[[File:Jeffrey sachs in Brazil.jpg|thumbnail|Jeffrey Sachs in Brazil in 2005]]

==The Millennium Development Goals==
Sachs places a great deal of emphasis on the [[United Nations]]' [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) as a first step towards eliminating [[extreme poverty]], which affected approximately 1.1 billion people worldwide at the time of publication. Sachs headed the [[United Nations Millennium Project]], which worked from 2002 to 2005 to establish the organizational means to achieve the MDGs.

He also offers some specific, immediate solutions, such as increasing the availability of anti-malarial bed nets in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], and encourages [[Debt relief|debt cancellation]] for the world's poorest countries. Sachs states that in order to achieve the goal of eliminating global poverty, clinical economics must be backed by greater funding; he argues that development aid must be raised from $65 billion globally as of 2002 to between $135 and $195 billion a year by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CEEDA1230F93AA35757C0A9609C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Paperback Row | first=Ihsan | last=Taylor | date=9 April 2006 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs argues that the developed world can afford to raise the poorest countries out of extreme poverty; he agrees with the MDG's calculation that 0.7 percent of the combined [[gross national product]] of first-world countries would be sufficient to achieve that goal.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, ''The End of Poverty'', 290 p&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2119">The '''Vostok traverse''' was a 3000 kilometre four-month trip across [[Antarctica]] undertaken by [[ANARE]] the [[Australia]]n National Antarctic Research Expedition in 1962. Using two bright red painted 1943 [[World War II]] [[M29 Weasel]] tracked vehicles and two 1950 D4 [[Caterpillar Inc.]] tractors the 6-man expedition left Wilkes Base on the coast for the [[Russia]]n [[Vostok Station]] deep in the Antarctic interior. Much of the journey was over previously unexplored territory. The Weasels achieved 2 miles to the gallon and the tractors one mile per gallon, so a fuel dump was requested from the American [[McMurdo Station]].

Navigating across the featureless landscape was accomplished by a lead Weasel fitted with a Pioneer [[compass]] suspended in front of the vehicle on an aluminium frame. This was done to prevent the steel of the vehicle swamping the weak natural magnetic field close to the pole. The lead Weasel had two [[:wikt:oblique|oblique]] mirrors, one in front of the driver facing upwards and the other positioned above the first and facing downwards and backwards. By keeping a bead on the following vehicles and the bamboo guide posts left at two and a half mile intervals, it was found the vehicles could keep a very straight path.

When they arrived they found the Russians had evacuated the station 12 months beforehand in such haste that food had been left half cooked on the stove. The generators were started up and the snap-frozen steaks were finished upon which the team feasted. The trip ranks as one of [[Australia]]'s most historic traverses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/history/exploration-and-expeditions/modern-expeditions/stories-from-the-archives/steak-and-onions-vostok-style|title=Steak and onions Vostok style (1962)|website=www.antarctica.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
