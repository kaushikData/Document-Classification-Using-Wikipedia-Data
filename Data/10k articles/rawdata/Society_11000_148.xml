The '''Agricultural Bank of China robbery''' was the [[embezzlement]] of nearly 51&amp;nbsp;million [[Renminbi|yuan]] ([[circa|c.]][[United States dollar|US$]]6.7&amp;nbsp;million) from the [[Handan]] branch of the [[Agricultural Bank of China]] (ABC) in [[Hebei]] province between March 16 and April 14, 2007. Perpetrated by two [[bank vault|vault]] managers employed at the branch, it is the largest [[bank robbery]] in [[China]]'s history.&lt;ref name="xinhua"&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-07/24/content_6424465.htm "Suspects of China's largest bank theft go on trial"], Lin Li, ''[[Xinhua News Agency]]'', July 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the heist had begun when one of the managers, '''Ren Xiaofeng''', stole 200,000 yuan (c.US$26,000) in October 2006 with the complicity of two [[security guard]]s, Zhao Xuenan and Zhang Qiang. Ren then purchased tickets for the Chinese [[lottery]], with the intention of winning a sufficiently large prize that he could return the missing funds before their absence was noted, and still have money left over for himself.&lt;ref name="iol"&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=29&amp;art_id=nw20070724221538761C663924 "Robbers buy lottery tickets worth millions"], ''The Independent Online'', July 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the unfavourable [[odds]] Ren was successful, and he was able to return the 200,000 to the vault.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6938819.stm "Chinese bankers in lottery loss"], Chris Xia, ''[[BBC News]]'', August 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Emboldened by his initial success, Ren joined forces with another manager, '''Ma Xiangjing''', to perpetrate the same crime on a far larger scale. During March and April 2007, the two stole 32.96&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;yuan (c.US$4.3&amp;nbsp;million), and spent almost the entire amount—31.25&amp;nbsp;million—on lottery tickets.&lt;ref name="shanghaidaily"&gt;[http://www.shanghaidaily.com/sp/article/2007/200708/20070809/article_326649.htm "Bank thieves sentenced to death for inside job"], Gu Jia, ''[[Shanghai Daily]]'', August 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This time good fortune was not on their side. In desperation, they stole six cash boxes containing a further 18&amp;nbsp;million yuan (c.US$2.3&amp;nbsp;million) on April 14, spending 14&amp;nbsp;million in a single day in an effort to recover their losses. Despite Handan reporting record lottery ticket sales, the two recouped only 98,000 yuan (c.US$12,700).&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article2851433.ece "Lottery bank robbers to be executed"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184847/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/asia/article2851433.ece |date=September 30, 2007 }}, Clifford Coonan, ''[[The Independent]]'', August 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, ABC [[branch manager]]s discovered the missing money and notified the police.&lt;ref name="xinhua"/&gt; With insufficient funds to cover the losses, Ren and Ma bought [[fake ID]]s and cars with their meagre winnings, and fled.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; This prompted an extensive manhunt, with the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Public Security Ministry]] placing the two men on their "Most Wanted" list.&lt;ref name="xinhua"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; Ma was arrested in [[Beijing]] on April 18, and Ren was found a day later in [[Lianyungang]], a coastal town in [[Jiangsu Province]].&lt;ref name="shanghaidaily"/&gt;

Ren and Ma were charged with embezzlement, while Zhao and Zhang, the security guards, were charged with misappropriating public funds. A fifth man, Song Changhai, was also prosecuted for harbouring Ma while he was on the run.&lt;ref name="xinhua"/&gt; The three accomplices were all given sentences of up to five years in prison, while the two managers were sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; A [[landlord]], a [[cab driver]], and a [[car salesman|car saleswoman]] in Lianyungang shared a 200,000 yuan reward for assisting police to arrest Ren, while in Handan five employees of the bank were fired.&lt;ref name="shanghaidaily"/&gt; Only 5.5&amp;nbsp;million yuan was ever recovered by the police, with the remainder squandered by the perpetrators' gambling.&lt;ref name="shanghaidaily"/&gt;

Both Ren and Ma were executed in [[Hebei]] province on April 1, 2008.&lt;ref name="RIA Novosti"&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/world/20080401/102665033.html "Chinese bank employees executed over largest ever bank theft"], ''[[RIA Novosti]]'', April 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Algerian Canadians''' are [[Canadian]] citizens of [[Algeria]]n ancestry or Algeria-born people residing in Canada, as well as people from the state of Algeria who are ethno-linguistic and religious minorities.

The '''Apapa Hoard''' is an important collection of medieval bronze jewellery found at [[Apapa]] near [[Lagos]], Nigeria. Dating to the early 16th Century, the hoard has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection since 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=16157&amp;plaA=16157-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
Items from the treasure consist entirely of bronze [[jewellery]]. They include a pair of wire bracelets, two bracelets designed in the form of interlocking animals, two [[Staff of office|staff]]-mounts with [[pendant]] bells, two ring-shaped armlets, a group of bells, a ring with cascabels and a [[gorget|breast plate]] in the shape of a ram's head with pendant bells. The latter object is the most prestigious item from the hoard and is one of the finest cast bronzes ever found in southern [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=619723&amp;partId=1&amp;place=16157&amp;plaA=16157-3-2&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The hoard was discovered by accident in 1907 when a [[Water well|well]] was being dug to a depth of 3 metres. The jewellery would have been worn by an elite member of a local tribe living in 15th-16th centuries and has been attributed by scholars to the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Kingdom of [[Owo]], which was for a long time under the control of the [[Benin Empire]]. Soon after its discovery, the hoard was acquired by a private collector who later sold it to the British Museum in 1930.

'''Asian Canadians''' are [[Canadians]] who can trace their [[Ancestor|ancestry]] back to the continent of [[Asia]] or [[Asian people]]. The term refers to a group of people that includes diverse populations, who have their Progenitor from [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], or [[South Asia]]. Canadians with Asian ancestry comprise the largest and fastest growing [[visible minority]] group in [[Canada]], with roughly 17.7% of the Canadian population. Most Asian Canadians are concentrated in the urban areas of [[Southern Ontario]], the [[Greater Vancouver]] area, [[Calgary]], and other large [[List of cities in Canada|Canadian cities]].

Asian Canadians considered [[visible minority|visible minorities]] may be classified as East Asian Canadian (e.g. [[Taiwanese Canadians]], [[Chinese Canadians]], [[Korean Canadians]], [[Japanese Canadians]]); Southeast Asian Canadian  (e.g. [[Vietnamese Canadians]], [[Filipino Canadians]]); South Asian Canadians (e.g. [[Sri Lankan Canadians]], [[Bangladeshi Canadians]], [[Indian Canadians]], [[Pakistani Canadians]]); or West Asian Canadians (e.g. [[Lebanese Canadians]], [[Iraqi Canadians]]).&lt;ref name="Statistics Canada 2009"&gt;{{cite web | title=Classification of visible minority | website=Statistics Canada | date=15 June 2009 | url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/concepts/definitions/minority01a | accessdate=25 August 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718232555/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/concepts/definitions/minority01a | archive-date=July 18, 2016 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During the 19th century, many Chinese arrived to take part in the [[British Columbia gold rushes]] and later for the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. The Chinese who came from [[Guangdong Province]] helped build the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through the [[Fraser Canyon]]. Many Japanese people arrived in the 1890s and became fishermen and merchants in [[British Columbia]]. Similarly in the late 1890s, Indian immigrants first arrived in Canada and settled in Vancouver. Most hailed from [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]].&lt;ref name=WRHp124&gt;Walton-Roberts and Hiebert, ''[http://www.cjrs-rcsr.org/archives/20-1-2/WaltonRoberts-Hieberts.pdf Immigration, Entrepreneurship, and the Family] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6TPl3lkri?url=http://www.cjrs-rcsr.org/archives/20-1-2/WaltonRoberts-Hieberts.pdf |date=2014-10-18 }}'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the [[Federal government of Canada|federal government]] passed the [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923]], which banned all Chinese immigration, and led to immigration restrictions for all [[East Asian]]s. In 1947, the act was repealed.   
    
During and after the [[Vietnam War]], a large wave of Vietnamese refugees began arriving in Canada. The [[Canadian Parliament]] created the [[Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada]] in 1985 to better address issues surrounding [[Canada-Asia Relations|Canada-Asia relations]], including trade, citizenship and immigration. When [[Hong Kong]] reverted to mainland Chinese rule, people emigrated and found new homes in Canada.    
    
In recent decades, a large number of people have come to Canada from [[India]] and other South Asian countries. As of 2016, [[South Asian Canadian|South Asians]] make up over 16 percent of the Greater Toronto Area's population, and are projected to make up 24 percent of the region's population by 2031.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=South Asian immigrants are transforming Toronto|author=Gee, Marcus|work=The Globe and Mail|date=July 4, 2011|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/south-asian-immigrants-are-transforming-toronto/article625650/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
    
Today, Asian Canadians form a significant minority within the population, and over 5 million Asians call Canada their home. Often referred by the Canadian media as "model minorities", Asian Canadians are among the educated and socioeconomically affluent groups in Canada. Asian Canadian students, in particular those of East Asian or [[South Asian Canadian|South Asian]] background, make up the majority of students at several Canadian universities.

'''Augusto Pestana''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the State of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. It is located at 28°31′01″S 53°39′01″W, at an altitude of 390 m (1,279 feet). The city is 320&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Porto Alegre]], 1,540&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Brasília]] and just 120&amp;nbsp;km east of the border with [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibge.gov.br Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was named after [[Augusto Pestana (politician)|Augusto Pestana]] (1868-1934), a Brazilian engineer and politician.

==History==

The area was originally inhabited by [[indigenous peoples of South America]] ("Umbu" tradition) about ten thousand years ago. In 1697, [[Spaniard]] [[Jesuits]] founded a [[Jesuit Reductions|Reduction]] in São João Batista, 40&amp;nbsp;km west of present-day Augusto Pestana. The whole region was eventually annexed by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in 1801. One hundred years later, [[Augusto Pestana (politician)|Augusto Pestana]], then director for Public Lands in Northwest [[Rio Grande do Sul]], founded a settlement on the Cadeado Range, between the Conceição and the Ijuizinho rivers (the name "Cadeado", padlock in Portuguese, is a reference to a checkpoint that existed on the road between [[Cruz Alta, Rio Grande do Sul|Cruz Alta]] and [[Santo Ângelo]]).&lt;ref&gt;LAZZAROTTO, Danilo. "História de Ijuí". Ijuí, Museu Antropológico Director Pestana, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first settlers were [[Germany|German]] immigrants, most of them from [[Pomerania]]. During [[World War II]], soldiers from Augusto Pestana fought for Brazil against [[Nazi Germany]]. The list of Pestanense members in the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] (FEB), active in the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre]] of the conflict, included Artur Goergen, Eugenio Ladvig and Helmuth Matte, now honored with street names in the city. The other FEB veterans were Sebaldo Goergen, Waldemar Senn, Albino Wilhens, Benno Müller, Oswin Wunder, Alípio Schmitt, Osvino Henrique Geiss, Adelino Mathias Dambroz, Emílio Papke, Alfonso Steiernagel e Arnoldo Gustavo Frantz.&lt;ref&gt;Monument to World War II Veterans, Praça Farroupilha.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, the settlement experienced a boom in [[wheat]] production and was incorporated in September 1965 as the municipality of '''Augusto Pestana'''. The first city government was formally installed on 14 May 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmaugustopestana.com.br City Government of Augusto Pestana]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Globalize/Eng|date=December 2017}}
A '''bestseller''' is, usually, a [[book]] that is included on a list of top-selling or frequently-borrowed titles, normally based on publishing industry and book trade figures and library circulation statistics; such lists may be published by [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, or [[book store]] chains. Some lists are broken down into classifications and specialties (number one best selling new novel, nonfiction book, cookbook, etc.). An author may also be referred to as a bestseller if their work often appears in this category.  Well-known bestseller lists in the U.S. are published by [[Publishers Weekly lists of bestselling novels in the United States|''Publishers Weekly'']], ''[[USA Today]]'',  ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Most of these lists track book sales from national and independent bookstores, as well as sales from major internet retailers such as [[Amazon.com]] and [[Barnes &amp; Noble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Diamond, Edwin |date=1995 |title=Behind the Times: Inside the New New York Times |url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0226144720&amp;id=LAfZ-Y13obwC&amp;pg=PA364 |page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In everyday use, the term ''bestseller'' is not usually associated with a specified level of [[sales]], and may be used very loosely indeed in publishers' publicity. Books of superior [[academia|academic]] value or [[literary merit]] tend not to be bestsellers, although there are exceptions. Lists simply give the highest-selling titles in the category over the stated period. Some books have sold many more copies than current "bestsellers", but over a long period of time.

[[Blockbuster (entertainment)|Blockbuster]]s for [[film]]s and [[chart-topper]]s in recorded music are similar terms, although, in film and music, these measures generally are related to industry sales figures for attendance, requests, broadcast plays, or units sold.

Particularly in the case of [[novel]]s, a large budget and a chain of [[literary agent]]s, [[editing|editor]]s, [[publisher]]s, [[reviewer]]s, [[retailer]]s, [[librarian]]s, and [[marketing]] efforts are involved in "making" bestsellers, that is, trying to increase sales.

Steinberg defined a bestseller as a book for which demand, within a short time of that book's initial publication, vastly exceeds what is then considered to be big sales.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, S. H. ''Five Hundred Years of Printing''. 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. N. Furbank. "The Twentieth-Century Bestseller". In Boris Ford (ed.). ''The Pelican Guide to English Literature''. Volume 7: "The Modern Age". Penguin Books. 1961. Page 429.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alternative definitions are offered by Mott, Hart and Escarpit: See Greenspan and Rose, ''Book History'', Pennsylvania State University, Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0 271 02050 4}}, vol 3, {{URL|1=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEZkkbohbtoC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;output=html_text p 288}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early best sellers==
The term "Best seller" is first known to have been recorded in print in 1889 in the [[Kansas City, Missouri]], newspaper ''The Kansas Times &amp; Star'',&lt;ref&gt;"best, a. and adv." The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Onlin December 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but the phenomenon of immediate popularity goes back to the early days of mass production of printed books. For earlier books, when the maximum number of copies that would be printed was relatively small, a count of editions is the best way to assess sales. Since effective [[history of copyright|copyright]] was slow to take hold, many editions were [[pirated]] well into the period of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and without effective [[royalties|royalty systems]] in place, authors often saw little, if any, of the revenues for their popular works.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
 
The earliest highly popular books were nearly all religious, but the [[Bible]], as a large book, remained expensive until the nineteenth century. This tended to keep the numbers printed and sold, low. Unlike today, it was important for a book to be short to be a bestseller, or it would be too expensive to reach a large audience. Very short works such as ''[[Ars moriendi]]'', the ''[[Biblia pauperum]]'', and versions of the ''[[Apocalypse]]'' were published as cheap [[block-book]]s in large numbers of different editions in several languages in the fifteenth century. These were probably affordable items for most of the minority of literate members of the population. In 16th and 17th century England ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678) and abridged versions of ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]'' were the most broadly read books. ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719) and ''[[The Adventures of Roderick Random]]'' (1748) were early eighteenth century short novels with very large publication numbers, as well as gaining international success..{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;For details of editions, see individual articles (in most cases)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', a novel by [[Laurence Sterne]], became a "cult" object in England and throughout Europe, with important cultural consequences among those who could afford to purchase books during the era of its publication. The same could be said of the works of [[Voltaire]], particularly his comedic and philosophically satirical novel, ''[[Candide]]'', which, according to recent research, sold more than 20,000 copies in its first month alone in 1759. Likewise, fellow French Enlightenment author [[Rousseau]], especially his ''[[Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse]]'' (1761) and of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s novel, ''Die Leiden des jungen Werther'' (''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'') (1774). As with some modern bestsellers, ''Werther'' spawned what today would be called a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] industry with items such as ''Werther eau de cologne'' and [[porcelain]] puppets depicting the main characters, being sold in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmeister, Gerhart. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=5596 "Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (The Sorrows of Young Werther)"]. ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. 17 June 2004.

By the time of [[Byron]] and Sir [[Walter Scott]], effective copyright laws existed, at least in England, and many authors depended heavily on their income from their large royalties. America remained a zone of piracy until the mid-nineteenth century, a fact of which [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Mark Twain]] bitterly complained. By the middle of the 19th century, a situation akin to modern publication had emerged, where most bestsellers were written for a popular taste and are now almost entirely forgotten, with odd exceptions such as ''[[East Lynne]]'' (remembered only for the line "Gone, gone, and never called me mother!"), the wildly popular ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', and [[Sherlock Holmes]].

== Description and types of bestseller ==
Bestsellers are usually separated into [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]] categories. Different list compilers have created a number of other subcategories. ''The New York Times'' was reported to have started its "Children's Books" section in 2001 just to move the [[Harry Potter]] books out of the No. 1, 2, and 3 positions on their fiction chart, which the then three-book series had monopolized for over a year.&lt;ref&gt;Bolonik, Kera. [http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2000/08/16/bestseller/ "A list of their own"]. Salon.com:August 16, 2000. Retrieved December 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bestsellers also may be ranked separately for [[hardcover]] and [[paperback]] editions. Typically, a hardcover edition appears first, followed in months or years by the much less expensive paperback version. Hardcover bestseller status may hasten the paperback release of the same, or slow the release, if hardcover sales are brisk enough. Some lists even have a third category, [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] bestsellers.

In the [[United Kingdom]], a hardcover book could be considered a "bestseller" with sales ranging from 4,000 to 25,000 copies per week, and in [[Canada]], bestsellers are determined according to weekly rankings in the country's national print sales tracking service, [[BookNet Canada|BNC]] SalesData.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/bestsellers/bestsellers-hardcover-fiction-may-25-2013/article4226573/|title=Bestsellers: Hardcover Fiction, September 3, 2016|publisher=The Globe &amp; Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many "bestseller lists" that display anywhere from 10 to 150 titles.

===Differences among lists===
Bestseller lists may vary widely, depending on the method used for calculating sales. The [[Book Sense#IndieBound.org|Indie]] bestseller lists, for example, use only sales numbers, provided by independently owned (non-chain) bookstores, while ''The New York Times'' list includes both wholesale and retail sales from a variety of sources. A book that sells well in gift shops and grocery stores may hit a ''The New York Times'' list without ever appearing on an Indie list. [[USA Today]] has only one list, not hardcover/paperback, so that relative sales of these categories cannot be ascertained from it.

Lists from [[Amazon.com]], the dominant on-line book retailer, are based only on sales from their own Web site, and are updated on an hourly basis. Wholesale sales figures are not factored into Amazon's calculations. Numerous Web sites offer advice for authors about a temporary method to boost their book higher on Amazon's list using carefully timed buying campaigns that take advantage of the frequent adjustments to rankings. For example, [[faith healing]] author [[Zhi Gang Sha]] has used this method to create a number of #1 bestsellers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zhi Gang Sha#Works]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The brief sales spike allows authors to tout that their book was an "Amazon.com top 100 seller" in marketing materials for books that actually have relatively low sales. Eventually book buyers may begin to recognize the relative differences among lists and settle upon which lists they will consult to determine their purchases.

The weight and price of a book may affect its positioning on lists. The Amazon.com list tends to favor [[hardcover]], more expensive books, where the shipping charge is a smaller percentage of the overall purchase price or is sometimes free, and which tend to be more deeply discounted than paperbacks. Inexpensive [[mass market paperback]]s tend to do better on ''The New York Times'' list than on Amazon's. Indie and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' separate mass market paperbacks onto their own list.

Category structure affects the positioning of a book in other ways. A book that might be buried on the Indie hardcover fiction list could be positioned very well on ''The New York Times'' hardcover advice list or the ''Publishers Weekly'' religion hardcover list.

===Verifiability===
Bestseller reports from companies such as Amazon.com, which appear to be based strictly on auditable sales to the public, may be at odds with bestseller lists compiled from more casual data, such as ''The New York Times'' lists' [[Statistical survey|survey]] of [[retailing|retailers]] and publishers. The exact method for ranking ''The New York Times'' bestseller lists is a closely guarded secret.

This situation suggests a similar one in the area of [[popular music]]. In 1991, [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'']] magazine switched its [[chart]] data from manual reports filed by stores, to automated [[cash register]] data collected by a service called [[SoundScan]]. The conversion saw a dramatic shake-up in chart content from one week to the next.

Today, many lists come from automated sources. Booksellers may use their [[Point of sale|POS (point-of-sale)]] systems to report automatically to Book Sense. Wholesalers such as the giant [[Ingram Content Group]] have bestseller calculations similar to Amazon's, but they are available only to subscribing retailers. [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] and other large retail chains collect sales data from retail outlets and their Web sites to build their own bestseller lists.

[[Nielsen BookScan]] U.S. is perhaps the most aggressive attempt to produce a completely automatic and trusted set of bestseller lists. They claim to be gathering data directly from cash registers at more than 4,500 retail locations, including [[independent bookstore]]s, large chains such as [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[Powell's Books]], and [[Borders Group|Borders]], and the general retailer [[Costco]]. Unlike the consumer-oriented lists, BookScan's data is extremely detailed and quite expensive. Subscriptions to BookScan cost up to $75,000 per year, but it can provide publishers and wholesalers with an accurate picture of book sales with regional and other statistical analyses.

===The making of a bestseller===
Ultimately, having a great number of buyers creates a bestseller; however, there is a distinct "making of" process that determines which books have the potential to achieve that status. Not all publishers rely on, nor strive for, bestsellers, as the survival of [[small press]]es indicates. Large publishing houses, on the other hand, are like major record labels and film studios, and require consistent high returns to maintain their large overhead. Thus, the stakes are high. It is estimated that 200,000 new books are published each year in the U.S., and less than 1% achieve bestseller status.&lt;ref name="by_the_numbers"&gt;Maryles, Daisy. [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20060109/7902-bestsellers-by-the-numbers-.html Bestsellers by the Numbers"]. Publishers Weekly; 9-Jan-2006. Retrieved 22-Apr-2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way, major players act as gatekeepers and enablers, including literary agents, editors, publishing houses, booksellers, and the media (particularly, publishers of book reviews and bestseller lists). The high visibility of an established and best-selling author is paramount in the equation also. In addition to writing the book, an author has to acquire representation and negotiate this publishing chain.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Brian and Power, Dee.

At least one scientific approach to creating bestsellers has been devised. In 2004, [[Didier Sornette]], a [[professor]] of [[geophysics]] and a [[complex system]]s theorist at [[UCLA]], using Amazon.com sales data, created a mathematical model for predicting bestseller potential based on very early sales results. This information could be used to identify a potential for bestseller status and recommend fine tuned [[advertising]] and [[publicity]] efforts accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physorg.com/news2207.html "Researchers use physics to analyze dynamics of bestsellers"]. [[PhysOrg.com]]: December 5, 2004. Retrieved December 7, 2005.&lt;br&gt;[http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/page.asp?RelNum=5686 "UCLA Physicist Applies Physics to Best-Selling Books"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701174152/http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/page.asp?RelNum=5686 |date=2007-07-01 }}. UCLA News: December 1, 2004. Retrieved December 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the authors of a book called ''[[The Discipline of Market Leaders]]'' colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts. The authors allegedly purchased over 10,000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to Bookscan. Because of the ancillary benefits of making [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] (speaking engagements, more book deals, and consulting) the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself. The book climbed to #8 on the list where it sat for 15 weeks, also peaking at #1 on the ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' best seller list. Since such lists hold the power of [[information cascade|cumulative advantage]] chart success often begets more chart success. And although such efforts are not illegal, they are considered highly unethical by publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Unread bestsellers===
Bestsellers have gained such great popularity that it has sometimes become fashionable to purchase them. Critics have pointed out that just because a book is purchased doesn't mean it will be read. The rising length of bestsellers may mean that more of them are simply becoming bookshelf decor. In 1985 members of the staff of ''[[The New Republic]]'' placed coupons redeemable for $5 cash inside 70 books that were selling well, and none of them were sent in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/15/books/think-tank-let-us-now-praise-books-well-sold-well-loved-but-seldom-read.html | title=THINK TANK; Let Us Now Praise Books Well Sold, Well Loved but Seldom Read | work=The New York Times| date=15 July 2002 | accessdate=10 February 2015 | author=Goldstein, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major publishers==
In April 2013 [[Penguin Random House]] was created to become the world’s largest publisher. The two major shareholders are [[Bertelsmann]] (53%) and Penguin Group (47%) owned by [[Pearson PLC]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/05/penguin-random-house-the-worlds-largest-book-publisher-that-will-counter-amazon/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major publishers include [[Thomson Reuters]], [[Reed Elsevier]], [[Wolters Kluwer]], [[Hachette Book Group USA|Hachette]], [[McGraw Hill Financial]], [[John Wiley and Sons]], [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]], [[HarperCollins]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], [[Macmillan Publishers]], and [[Harlequin Enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/financial-reporting/article/52677-the-world-s-54-largest-book-publishers-2012.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural role==
While the basic dictionary definition of ''bestseller'' is self-evident, "a popular, top-selling book", the practical cultural definition is somewhat more complex. As consumer bestseller lists generally do not detail specific criteria, such as numbers sold, sales period, sales region, and so forth, a book becomes a bestseller mainly because an "authoritative" source says it is. Calling a book a "top-selling" title is not so impressive as calling it "''The New York Times'' bestseller".  Although the former phrase is assumed to be derived from sales figures, the latter benefits from the high profile of the particular list. A book that is identified as a "bestseller" greatly improves its chance of selling to a much wider audience. In this way, ''bestseller'' has taken on its own popular meaning, rather independent of empirical data, by becoming a compromised product category and, in effect, attempting to create a marketing image. For example, a "summer bestseller" is usually determined long before the summer is over, and signals a book's suitability for millions of lounging pool-side readers.

The use of the marketing phrase, ''underground bestseller'' further illustrates the independent-from-sales, self-defining aspect of the term. For example, publisher HarperCollins suggested the bestseller potential of ''Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood: A Novel'' by announcing "...four years after her award-winning, underground bestseller, ''Little Altars Everywhere''..." in the promotion. The book went on to achieve bestseller status in the 1990s. In reviews of the 2002 film of the same name, the novel's bestseller status was cited routinely, as in "compelling adaptation of Rebecca Wells' bestseller".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpercollins.com/global_scripts/product_catalog/book_xml.asp?isbn=0060173289 About Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527224752/http://www.harpercollins.com/global_scripts/product_catalog/book_xml.asp?isbn=0060173289 |date=2006-05-27 }}, HarperCollins.

The famous [[Diogenes Verlag|Diogenes]] Publisher at [[Zürich]] ([[Switzerland|Swiss]]) started to talk about its own  [[Worstseller]]s in 2006, and therewith brought a new mode-word into the German speaking European countries.

==Connection with the movie industry==
Bestsellers play a significant role in the [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]] movie industry. There is a long-standing [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] practice of turning bestsellers into feature films. Many, if not the majority, of modern movie "classics" began as bestsellers. On the ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' fiction bestsellers of the year charts, we find: #1: ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' (2003), #3. ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]'' (1974); #2. ''[[The Exorcist (novel)|The Exorcist]]'' (1971); #1. ''[[Love Story (novel)|Love Story]]'' (1970); #2. ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1969); among many others. Several of each year's fiction bestsellers ultimately are made into high-profile movies. Being a bestseller novel in the U.S. during the last forty years has guaranteed consideration for a big budget, wide-release movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/12/08/successful-film-adaptations-tech-media_cz_sc_books06_1208moviebook.html | title=From Best Seller To Blockbuster | publisher=''Forbes'' | date=12 November 2006 | accessdate=11 February 2015 | author=Chaudhuri , Saabira}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caderbooks.com/bestintro.html Publishers Weekly Bestseller Lists 1990-1995].

'''Buda''' (or '''bouda'''), in [[Ethiopia]]n [[folk religion]], is the power of the [[evil eye]] and the ability to [[werehyena|change into a hyena]].  Buda is generally believed to be a power held and wielded by those in a different social group, for example among the [[Beta Israel]] or metalworkers.&lt;ref name="finneran"&gt;Finneran, Niall. "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_3_114/ai_n6118470/ Ethiopian Evil Eye Belief and the Magical Symbolism of Iron Working.]" ''Folklore'', Vol. 114, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wagaw"&gt;Wagaw, Teshome G. ''For Our Soul: Ethiopian Jews in Israel''.  Detroit: Wayne State Univ. Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|20-21}}  The belief is also present in [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], and among the [[Berber people]] in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name="woodward"&gt;{{cite book | author= Woodward, Ian | title=The Werewolf Delusion | year=1979 | isbn= 0-448-23170-0 | page= 256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belief in the evil eye, or buda, is widespread in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, John W. "Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity: Faith and practices". ''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/ettoc.html A Country Study: Ethiopia]''. Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, eds. Washington: Library of Congress Federal Research Division, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Beta Israel, or Ethiopian Jews, are often characterized by others as possessing buda.&lt;ref name="wagaw" /&gt;{{Rp|20-21}}  Other castes such as ironworkers are often labeled as bearing the buda.&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;  In fact, the word for manual worker, ''tabib'', is also used to denote "one with the evil eye."&lt;ref name="beckwith"&gt;Beckwith, Carol, Angela Fisher, and Graham Hancock. ''African Ark''. New York: Henry N. Abrams, Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|49}}  The alleged evil power of the tabib is believed to be at a level similar to that of [[Witchcraft|witches]].&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;

Buda's alleged prevalence among outsiders correlates with the traditional belief that evil eye curses themselves are rooted in envy.  As such, those allegedly possessing the power of buda might do so because of malevolent spirits.  One study specifies that they are believed to be "empowered by evil spirit".&lt;ref name="geleta"&gt;Geleta, Amsalu Tadesse.  "[http://www.lausanne.org/all-documents/ethiopian-case-study.html Case Study: Demonization and the Practice of Exorcism in Ethiopian Churches] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101104543/http://www.lausanne.org/all-documents/ethiopian-case-study.html |date=2010-01-01 }}".  Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, Nairobi, August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Niall Finneran describes how "the idea of magical creation underpins the perception of artisans in Ethiopia and in the wider African context. In many cases these skills have been acquired originally from an elemental source of evil via the paternal lineage, rather like a [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian pact]]."&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;  The power of the evil eye allows its bearer to change into a [[hyena]], allowing him or her to attack another person while concealing his or her human identity.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;

Some Ethiopian Christians carry an [[amulet]] or talisman, known as a ''[[kitab]]'', or will invoke God's name, to ward off the ill effects of buda.&lt;ref name="kemp"&gt;Kemp, Charles.  "[http://bearspace.baylor.edu/Charles_Kemp/www/ethiopian_refugees.htm Ethiopians &amp; Eritreans.]"  ''Refugee Health – Immigrant Health''. Waco, TX: Baylor University.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[debtera]], who is either an unordained priest or educated layperson, will create these protective amulets or talismans.&lt;ref name="finneran" /&gt;&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;

[[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] priests continue to intervene and perform exorcisms on behalf of those believed to be afflicted by demons or buda.  Such persons are brought to a church or prayer meeting.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;  Amsalu Geleta, in a modern case study, relates elements that are common to Ethiopian Christian exorcisms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It includes singing praise and victory songs, reading from the Scripture, prayer and confronting the spirit in the name of Jesus. Dialogue with the spirit is another important part of the exorcism ceremony. It helps the counselor (exorcist) to know how the spirit was operating in the life of the demoniac. The signs and events mentioned by the spirit are affirmed by the victim after deliverance.&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exorcism is not always successful, and Geleta notes another instance in which the usual methods were unsuccessful, and the demons apparently left the subject at a later time.  In any event, "in all cases the spirit is commanded in no other name than the name of Jesus."&lt;ref name="geleta" /&gt;

[[File:C.F. Andrews, Anglican priest.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.1|The bust of C.F.Andrews over his grave, in Lower Circular Road Christian Cemetery - [[Kolkata]] Earlier [[Calcutta]]]]
'''Charles Freer Andrews''' (12 February 1871 – 5 April 1940) was a [[Church of England]] [[priest]]. A [[Christian missionary]], educator and social reformer in [[India]], he became a close friend of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and identified with the cause of [[Independence of India|India's independence]]. He was instrumental in convincing Gandhi to  return to [[India]] from [[South Africa]], where Gandhi had been a leading light in the Indian civil rights struggle.

C. F. Andrews was affectionately dubbed ''Christ's Faithful Apostle'' by Gandhi, based on his initials, C.F.A. For his contributions to the [[Indian Independence Movement]] Gandhi and his students at [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi]], named him ''[[Honorary titles of Indian leaders|Deenabandhu]]'', or "Friend of the Poor".

==Early life==
Charles Freer Andrews was born on 12 February 1871 at 14 Brunel Terrace, [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Northumberland]],&lt;!--as was--&gt; [[United Kingdom]]; his father was the "Angel" ([[Catholic Apostolic Church#Bishops|bishop]]) of the [[Catholic Apostolic Church]] in [[Birmingham]]. The family had suffered financial misfortune because of the duplicity of a friend, and had to work hard to make ends meet. Andrews was a pupil at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], and afterwards read ''[[Classics]]'' at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=ANDS890CF|name=Andrews, Charles Freer}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period he moved away from his family's church and was accepted for ordination in the [[Church of England]].

In 1896 Andrews became a [[deacon]], and took over the Pembroke College Mission in south [[London]]. A year later he was made priest, and became Vice-Principal of [[Westcott House, Cambridge|Westcott House]] Theological College in Cambridge.

==In India==
{{See also|Indian Independence Movement}}

Andrews had been involved in the [[Christian Social Union (Church of England)|Christian Social Union]] since university, and was interested in exploring the relationship between a commitment to the [[Gospel]] and a commitment to justice, through which he was attracted to struggles for justice throughout the [[British Empire]], especially in [[British Raj|India]].

In 1904 he joined the [[Cambridge Mission to Delhi]] and arrived there to teach philosophy at [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi|St. Stephen's College]], where he grew close to many of his Indian colleagues and students. Increasingly dismayed by the racist behaviour and treatment of Indians by some British officials and civilians, he supported Indian political aspirations, and wrote a letter in the ''Civil and Military Gazette'' in 1906 voicing these sentiments. Andrews soon became involved in the activities of the [[Indian National Congress]], and he helped to resolve the 1913 cotton workers' strike in [[Madras]].

==With Gandhi in South Africa==
Known for his persuasiveness, intellect and moral rectitude, he was asked by senior Indian political leader [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]] to visit South Africa and help the Indian community there to resolve their political disputes with the Government. He met a young [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] lawyer, [[Mohandas Gandhi]], who was attempting to organise the [[Natal Indian Congress]] and the Indian community to protest against the [[racial discrimination]] and police legislation that infringed their civil liberties. Andrews was deeply impressed with Gandhi's knowledge of [[Christian values]] and his espousal of the concept of [[ahimsa]], ''[[nonviolence]]'' - something that Gandhi mixed with inspiration from elements of [[Christian anarchism]]. He helped Gandhi to organise an [[Ashram]] in [[Natal Province|Natal]] and publish his famous magazine, ''The Indian Opinion''.

Following the advice of several Indian Congress leaders and of Principal [[S. K. Rudra|Susil Kumar Rudra]], of St. Stephen's College, Andrews was instrumental in persuading Gandhi to return to India with him in 1915.

==Tagore and Sree Narayana Guru==
In 1918 Andrews disagreed with Gandhi's attempts to recruit combatants for [[World War I]], believing that this was inconsistent with their views on nonviolence. In ''Mahatma Gandhi's Ideas'' Andrews wrote about Gandhi's recruitment campaign: "Personally I have never been able to reconcile this with his own conduct in other respects, and it is one of the points where I have found myself in painful disagreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrews, C.F.|year=1930|title=Mahatma Gandhi's Ideas|publisher=Macmillan|page=133|quote=The Teaching of Ahimsa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrews was elected President of the ''All India Trade Union'' in 1925 and 1927.

Andrews developed a [[Interreligious dialogue|dialogue]] between [[Christianity|Christians]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]]. He spent a lot of time at [[Santiniketan]] in conversation with the poet and philosopher [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. He also supported the movement to ban the ‘untouchability of outcasts’. In 1919 he joined the famous [[Vaikom Satyagraha]], and in 1933 assisted [[B.R. Ambedkar]] in formulating the demands of the ''Dalits''.

Once C.F. Andrews, along with Rabindranath Tagore, visited [[Sree Narayana Guru]], a spiritual leader from [[Kerala]], South India.  Then he wrote to [[Romain Rolland]]; that ''I have seen our Christ walking on the shore of arabian sea in the attire of a hindu sanyasin'' .{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

He and [[Agatha Harrison]] arranged for Gandhi's visit to the UK.&lt;ref name=help&gt;[http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/agatha-harrison Agatha Harrison], Open University, Retrieved 20 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He accompanied Gandhi to the second [[Round Table Conference]] in [[London]], helping him to negotiate with the British government on matters of Indian autonomy and devolution.

== In Fiji ==
When the news reached India, through the writings of Christian missionaries [[J. W. Burton]], [[Hannah Dudley]], and [[R. Piper]]{{who|date=October 2018}} and a returned indentured labourer, [[Totaram Sanadhya]], of the mistreatment of Indian indentured labourers in [[Fiji]], the [[Indian Government]] in September 1915 sent Andrews and W. W. Pearson to make inquiries. The two visited numerous plantations and interviewed indentured labourers, overseers and Government officials and on their return to India also interviewed returned labourers. In their  "Report on Indentured Labour in Fiji" Andrews and Pearson highlighted the ills of the indenture system;  which led to the end of further transportation of Indian labour to the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonies. In 1917 Andrews made a second visit to Fiji, and although he reported some improvements, was still appalled at the moral degradation of indentured labourers. He called for an immediate end to indenture; and the system of Indian indentured labour was formally abolished in 1920.

In 1936, while on a visit to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], Andrews was invited to and visited Fiji again. The ex-indentured labourers and their descendants wanted him to help them overcome a new type of ''[[slavery]]'', by which they were bound to the [[Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji)|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]], which controlled all aspects of their lives. Andrews, however, was delighted with the improvements in conditions since his last visit, and asked [[Indians in Fiji|Fiji Indians]] to "remember that Fiji belonged to the Fijians and they were there as guests."

==Later life==
About this time Gandhi reasoned with Andrews that it was probably best for sympathetic Britons like himself to leave the freedom struggle to Indians. So from 1935 onwards Andrews began to spend more time in Britain, teaching young people all over the country about Christ’s call to [[radical discipleship]]. Gandhi's affectionate nickname for Andrews was ''Christ’s Faithful Apostle'', based on the initials of his name, "C.F.A". He was widely known as Gandhi's closest friend and was perhaps the only major figure to address Gandhi by his first name, Mohan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=fbf5c6e5-48ea-48c5-9949-7e95d318eacf|title=His faith, our faith|work=hindustantimes.com/}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlie Andrews died on 5 April 1940, during a visit to [[Calcutta]], and is buried in the 'Christian Burial ground' of [[Lower Circular Road cemetery]], Calcutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110109/jsp/calcutta/story_13411918.jsp|title=The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) - Metro - A love-hate relationship with Calcutta|work=telegraphindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090228/jsp/opinion/story_10594967.jsp|title=The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) - Opinion - Searching for Charlie|work=telegraphindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
He is widely commemorated and respected in India. Two undergraduate colleges of the [[University of Calcutta]], the [[Dinabandhu Andrews College]], and the [[Dinabandhu Institution]] and one High School in Salimpur area of south Kolkata commemorate his name. The Dinabandhu Andrews College was constituted with an aim of disseminating higher education to a huge number of children of the displaced persons from erstwhile [[East Pakistan]], presently [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dacollege.org/about.html Dinabandhu Andrews College]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a major character, portrayed by British actor [[Ian Charleson]], in the 1982 film, ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', by [[Richard Attenborough]]. He is honored with a [[feast day]] in the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] on 12 February.

In 1971, India issued a commemorative postage stamp to mark the birth centenary of Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;http://postagestamps.gov.in/Images/Stamps1971/12-02-1971.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cleveland Street scandal''' occurred in 1889, when a homosexual male [[brothel]] in [[Cleveland Street, London]], was discovered by police. The government was accused of covering up the scandal to protect the names of aristocratic and other prominent patrons. At the time, sexual acts between men were illegal in Britain, and the brothel's clients faced possible prosecution and certain social ostracism if discovered. It was rumoured that [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], the eldest son of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales]] and [[Line of succession to the British throne|second-in-line to the British throne]] had visited, though this has never been substantiated. Unlike overseas newspapers, the English press never named the Prince, but the allegation influenced the handling of the case by the authorities,&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; and has coloured biographers' perceptions of him since.

The police acquired testimonies that [[Lord Arthur Somerset (1851–1926)|Lord Arthur Somerset]], an [[equerry]] to the Prince of Wales, was a patron.&lt;ref&gt;Lees-Milne, James (1986). ''The Enigmatic Edwardian''. Sidgwick and Jackson. p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Both he and the brothel keeper, Charles Hammond, managed to flee abroad before a prosecution could be brought. The [[male prostitute]]s, who also worked as telegraph messenger boys for the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|Post Office]], were given light sentences and no clients were prosecuted. After [[Henry James FitzRoy, Earl of Euston]], was named in the press as a client, he successfully sued for [[libel]].

The scandal fuelled the attitude that male homosexuality was an aristocratic vice that corrupted lower-class youths. Such perceptions were still prevalent in 1895 when the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]] accused [[Oscar Wilde]] of being an active homosexual.

In July 1889, Police Constable Luke Hanks was investigating a theft from the London Central Telegraph Office. During the investigation, a fifteen-year-old [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] boy named Charles Thomas Swinscow was discovered to be in possession of fourteen [[shilling]]s, equivalent to several weeks of his wages. At the time, messenger boys were not permitted to carry any personal cash in the course of their duties, to prevent their own money being mixed with that of the customers. Suspecting the boy's involvement in the theft, Constable Hanks brought him in for questioning. After hesitating, Swinscow admitted that he earned the money working as a prostitute for a man named Charles Hammond, who operated a male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street. According to Swinscow, he was introduced to Hammond by a [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]] clerk, eighteen-year-old Henry Newlove. In addition, he named two seventeen-year-old telegraph boys who also worked for Hammond: George Alma Wright and Charles Ernest Thickbroom. Constable Hanks obtained corroborating statements from Wright and Thickbroom and, armed with these, a confession from Newlove.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, pp. 8–10 and Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 20–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--References for the entire paragraph--&gt;

Constable Hanks reported the matter to his superiors and the case was given to Detective Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]]. Inspector Abberline went to the brothel on 6 July with a warrant to arrest Hammond and Newlove for violation of Section 11 of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]]. The Act made all homosexual acts between men, as well as procurement or attempted procurement of such acts, punishable by up to two years' imprisonment with or without hard labour. He found the house locked and Hammond gone, but Abberline was able to apprehend Newlove at his mother's house in [[Camden Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, pp. 11, 16–17 and Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; In the time between his statement to Hanks and his arrest, Newlove had gone to Cleveland Street and warned Hammond, who had consequently escaped to his brother's house in [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

On the way to the police station, Newlove named [[Lord Arthur Somerset (1851–1926)|Lord Arthur Somerset]] and [[Henry FitzRoy, Earl of Euston]], as well as an army colonel by the name of Jervois, as visitors to Cleveland Street.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 11 and Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Somerset was the head of the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales's]] stables. Although Somerset was interviewed by police, no immediate action was taken against him, and the authorities were slow to act on the allegations of Somerset's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; A watch was placed on the now-empty house and details of the case shuffled between government departments.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 26–33&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 August, an arrest warrant was issued in the name of George Veck, an acquaintance of Hammond's who pretended to be a clergyman. Veck had actually worked at the Telegraph Office, but had been sacked for "improper conduct" with the messenger boys.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, pp. 11, 133 and Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; A seventeen-year-old youth found in Veck's London lodgings revealed to the police that Veck had gone to [[Portsmouth]] and was returning shortly by train. The police arrested Veck at [[London Waterloo station|London Waterloo railway station]]. In his pockets they discovered letters from Algernon Allies. Abberline sent Constable Hanks to interview Allies at his parents' home in [[Sudbury, Suffolk]]. Allies admitted to receiving money from Somerset, having a sexual relationship with him, and working at Cleveland Street for Hammond.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, pp. 134–135 and Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August, police interviewed Somerset for a second time, after which Somerset left for [[Bad Homburg]],&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; where the Prince of Wales was taking his summer holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September, Newlove and Veck were committed for trial. Their defence was handled by Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, with [[Sir Charles Willie Mathews, 1st Baronet|Willie Mathews]] appearing for Newlove, and Charles Gill for Veck. Somerset paid the legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 35, 45, 47&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Somerset had moved on to [[Hanover]], to inspect some horses for the Prince of Wales, and the press was referring to "noble lords" implicated in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 42, 46&lt;/ref&gt; Newlove and Veck pleaded guilty to indecency on 18 September and the judge, Sir [[Thomas Chambers (MP)|Thomas Chambers]], a former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament who had a reputation for leniency, sentenced them to four and nine months' hard labour respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 47–53&lt;/ref&gt; The boys were also given sentences that were considered at the time to be very lenient.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Hammond escaped to France, but the French authorities expelled him after pressure from the British. Hammond moved on to Belgium from where he emigrated to the United States. Newton, acting for Somerset, paid for Hammond's passage.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 74–77&lt;/ref&gt; On the advice of the Prime Minister, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], no extradition proceedings were attempted, and the case against Hammond was quietly dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 136 and Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 27, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Somerset returned to Britain in late September to attend horse sales at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] but suddenly left for [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]] on 26 September, probably after being told by Newton that he was in danger of being arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; He returned again on 30 September. A few days later, his grandmother, Emily Somerset, Dowager Duchess of Beaufort, died and he attended her funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 140 and Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hamilton Cuffe, 5th Earl of Desart|The Hon. Hamilton Cuffe]], [[Treasury Solicitor's Department|Assistant Treasury Solicitor]], and [[James Monro]], [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner of Police]], pressed for action to be taken against Somerset, but the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury|Lord Halsbury]], blocked any prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours of Somerset's involvement were circulating, and on 19 October Somerset fled back to France. Lord Salisbury was later accused of warning Somerset through Sir [[Dighton Probyn]], who had met Lord Salisbury the evening before, that a warrant for his arrest was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; This was denied by Lord Salisbury&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Attorney General]], Sir [[Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Richard Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Probyn's informant may have been the Assistant Commissioner of Police, [[Richard Pearson (police officer)|Richard Pearson]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridley, Jane (2013). ''The Heir Apparent''. Random House. p. 657 n. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince of Wales wrote to Lord Salisbury, expressing satisfaction that Somerset had been allowed to leave the country and asking that if Somerset should "ever dare to show his face in England again", he would remain unmolested by the authorities,&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; but Lord Salisbury was also being pressured by the police to prosecute Somerset. On 12 November, a warrant for Somerset's arrest was finally issued.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 144 and Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Somerset was already safely abroad, and the warrant caught little public attention.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; After an unsuccessful search for employment in [[Turkey]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], Somerset lived the rest of his life in self-imposed and comfortable exile in the south of France.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Other names mentioned by the press were [[Lord Ronald Gower]] and Lord Errol.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CHP18891209.2.40.2&amp; The London Scandals]", ''The Press'' (New Zealand), Volume XLVI, Issue 7418, 9 December 1889, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt; Also implicated was the prominent social figure [[Alexander Meyrick Broadley]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article108795706 The West End Scandal: Another Flight]", ''Evening News'' (Sydney, Australia), Tuesday 14 January 1890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Another London Society Leader Gone", ''The Salt Lake Herald'', Wednesday 1 January 1890&lt;/ref&gt; who fled abroad for four years.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1916/05/08/page/6/article/la-marquise-de-fontenoy La Marquise de Fontenoy]" (pseudonym of Marguerite Cunliffe-Owen), ''Chicago Tribune'', 8 May 1916&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article138599026 Vanity Fair]" by J.M.D., ''The Australasian'' (Melbourne), 22 September 1894&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris ''Figaro'' even alleged that Broadley took [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|General Georges Boulanger]] and [[Victor Henri Rochefort, Marquis de Rochefort-Luçay|Henri Rochefort]] to the house.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1890/02/02/page/4/article/to-fight-this-morning Boulanger Mixed Up in a Scandal]", ''Chicago Tribune'', 2 February 1890, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The allegation against Boulanger was later challenged by his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;"Brevities by Cable", ''Chicago Tribune'', 1 August 1890&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1889 it was reported that both the Prince and Princess of Wales were being "daily assailed with anonymous letters of the most outrageous character" bearing upon the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3424707/3424712/112/ Notes on Current Topics]", ''The Cardiff Times'' 7 December 1889, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1890 sixty suspects had been identified, twenty-two of whom had fled the country.&lt;ref name=paperspast&gt;"[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CHP18900206.2.45&amp; The Cleveland Street Scandal]", ''The Press'' (Canterbury, New Zealand), Volume XLVII, Issue 74518, 6 February 1890, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public revelations ==
[[File:AlVicarticle.jpg|frame|left|American newspapers claimed that Prince Albert Victor was "mixed up" in the scandal.|alt=Newspaper clipping]]

Because the press barely covered the story, the affair would have faded quickly from public memory if not for journalist Ernest Parke. The editor of the obscure [[Political radicalism|politically radical]] weekly ''The North London Press'', Parke got wind of the affair when one of his reporters brought him the story of Newlove's conviction. Parke began to question why the prostitutes had been given such light sentences relative to their offence (the usual penalty for "gross indecency" was two years) and how Hammond had been able to evade arrest. His curiosity aroused, Parke found out that the boys had named prominent aristocrats. He subsequently ran a story on 28 September hinting at their involvement but without detailing specific names.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; It was only on 16 November that he published a follow up story specifically naming Henry Fitzroy, Earl of Euston, in "an indescribably loathsome scandal in Cleveland Street".&lt;ref&gt;''North London Press'', 16 November 1889, quoted in Hyde, ''The Other Love'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; He further alleged that Euston may have gone to Peru and that he had been allowed to escape to cover up the involvement of a more highly placed person,&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 150 and Hyde, ''The Other Love'', p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; who was not named but was believed by some to be Prince Albert Victor, the son of the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Other Love'', p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Euston was in fact still in England and immediately filed a case against Parke for libel. At the trial, Euston admitted that when walking along [[Piccadilly]] a [[tout]] had given him a card which read "''Poses plastiques''. C. Hammond, 19 Cleveland Street". Euston testified that he went to the house believing ''Poses plastiques'' meant a display of female nudes. He paid a [[Sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]] to get in but upon entering Euston said he was appalled to discover the "improper" nature of the place and immediately left. The defence witnesses contradicted each other, and could not describe Euston accurately.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, pp. 151–159 and Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 113–116, 139–143&lt;/ref&gt; The final defence witness, [[John Saul (prostitute)|John Saul]], was a male prostitute who had earlier been involved in a homosexual scandal at Dublin Castle, and featured in a clandestinely published erotic novel ''[[The Sins of the Cities of the Plain]]'' which was cast as his autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Delivering his testimony in a manner described as "brazen effrontery", Saul admitted to earning his living by leading an "immoral life" and "practising criminality", and detailed his alleged sexual encounters with Euston at the house.&lt;ref&gt;Saul quoted in Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; The defence did not call either Newlove or Veck as witnesses, and could not produce any evidence that Euston had left the country. On 16 January 1890, the jury found Parke guilty and the judge sentenced him to twelve months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, pp. 151–159 and Hyde, ''The Other Love'', pp. 125–127&lt;/ref&gt; One historian considers Euston was telling the truth and only visited Cleveland Street once because he was misled by the card.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Other Love'', p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; However, another has alleged Euston was a well-known figure in the homosexual underworld, and was extorted so often by the notorious blackmailer Robert Cliburn, that Oscar Wilde had quipped Cliburn deserved the [[Victoria Cross]] for his tenacity.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Saul stated that he told the police his story in August, which provoked the judge to enquire rhetorically why the authorities had not taken action.&lt;ref&gt;"Lord Euston's Libel Case", ''South Australian Register'', 18 February 1890, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge, Sir [[Henry Hawkins, 1st Baron Brampton|Henry Hawkins]], had a distinguished career, although after his death a former [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]] Sir [[Edward George Clarke|Edward Clarke]] wrote: "Sir Henry Hawkins was the worst judge I ever knew or heard of. He had no notion whatever of what justice meant, or of the obligations of truth or fairness."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1517158 The Worst Judge I Ever Knew]", ''The Argus'' (Melbourne), 15 May 1915&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecuting counsels, [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]] and [[Sir Charles Willie Mathews, 1st Baronet|Willie Mathews]], went on to become [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] and [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], respectively. The defence counsel, [[Frank Lockwood (politician)|Frank Lockwood]], later became Solicitor General, and he was assisted by [[H. H. Asquith]], who became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] twenty years later.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 153 and Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

While Parke's conviction cleared Euston, another trial began on 16 December 1889 when Newlove's and Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, was charged with [[obstruction of justice]]. It was alleged that he conspired to prevent Hammond and the boys from testifying by offering or giving them passage and money to go abroad. Newton was defended by Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Ernest Parke, and the prosecutor was Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney General. Newton pleaded guilty to one of the six charges against him, claiming that he had assisted Hammond to flee merely to protect his clients, who were not at that time charged with any offence or under arrest, from potential blackmail. The Attorney General accepted Newton's pleas and did not present any evidence on the other five charges.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 162–207&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May, the judge, Sir [[Lewis Cave]], sentenced Newton to six weeks in prison,&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely considered by members of the legal profession to be harsh. A petition signed by 250 London law firms was sent to the [[Home Secretary]], [[Henry Matthews, 1st Viscount Llandaff|Henry Matthews]], protesting at Newton's treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 208–212&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Labouchère.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Labouchère]] accused the government of conspiring to hush up the scandal.|alt=Head and shoulders of a bearded middle-aged gentleman]]

During Newton's trial, a motion in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sought to investigate Parke's allegations of a cover-up. [[Henry Labouchère]], a Member of Parliament from the Radical wing of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], was staunchly against homosexuality and had campaigned successfully to add the "gross indecency" amendment (known as the "[[Labouchere Amendment|Labouchère Amendment]]") to the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]]. He was convinced that the conspiracy to cover up the scandal went further up the government than assumed. Labouchère made his suspicions known in Parliament on 28 February 1890. He denied that "a gentleman of very high position"—presumably Prince Albert Victor—was in any way involved with the scandal, but accused the government of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. He suggested that the Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and other officials colluded to hamper the investigation,&lt;ref name="Northampton"&gt;''Mr Labouchere's Suspension'', ''Northampton Mercury'' 8 March 1890, p5&lt;/ref&gt; allowing Somerset and Hammond to escape, delaying the trials and failing to prosecute the case with vigour. Labouchère's accusations were rebutted by the Attorney General, Sir Richard Webster, who was also the prosecutor in the Newton case. Charles Russell, who had prosecuted Parke and was defending Newton, sat on the Liberal benches with Labouchère but refused to be drawn into the debate. After an often passionate debate over seven hours, during which Labouchère was expelled from Parliament after saying "I do not believe Lord Salisbury" and refusing to withdraw his remark, the motion was defeated by a wide margin, 206–66.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', pp. 215–231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Reference for the entire paragraph--&gt; In a subsequent speech to the House of Lords, Salisbury bore witness against himself by suggesting his memory of his handling of the affair was defective.&lt;ref name="Northampton" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Public interest in the scandal eventually faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice, presenting the telegraph boys as corrupted and exploited by members of the upper class. This attitude reached its climax a few years later when [[Oscar Wilde]] was tried for gross indecency as the result of his affair with [[Lord Alfred Douglas]].

Oscar Wilde alluded to the scandal in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', first published in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;In chapter 12 of the original 1890 version, one of the characters, Basil Hallward, refers to "Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England, with a tarnished name".&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of the novel were hostile; in a clear reference to the Cleveland Street scandal, one reviewer called it suitable for "none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys".&lt;ref&gt;"Reviews and Magazines".

(2004). "Literature in the Dock: The Trials of Oscar Wilde". ''Journal of Law and Society'' '''31:''' (No. 1) 113–130&lt;/ref&gt; After the failure of his suit, Wilde was charged with gross indecency, found guilty and subsequently sentenced to two years' hard labour. He was prosecuted by Charles Gill, who had defended Veck in the Cleveland Street case.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence (1864-1892).jpg|thumb|left|[[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor of Wales]] was created Duke of Clarence and Avondale the year after the scandal.|alt=Smartly=dressed young man with a moustache]]

Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society gossip about his sex life continued. Sixty years after the scandal the official biographer of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], [[Harold Nicolson]], was told by [[Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard|Lord Goddard]], who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy at the time of the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated."&lt;ref&gt;Lees-Milne, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer [[Harvey Crippen]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook, pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, pp. 285–286 and Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/e-h/eddy6.html ''Prince Eddy: The King We Never Had''.] [[Channel 4]]. Accessed 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[State paper]]s on the case in the [[Public Record Office]], released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, [[Augustus Stephenson|Sir Augustus Stephenson]], "I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true."&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]], confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing&amp;nbsp;... we were both accused of going to this place but not together&amp;nbsp;... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention."&lt;ref&gt;Lord Arthur Somerset to Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher, 10 December 1889, quoted in Cook, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; In his correspondence, Sir [[Dighton Probyn]] refers to "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" and "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story".&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the ''[[New York Herald]]'' published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by [[Charles Hall (lawyer)|Charles Hall]], saying "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor."&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'', p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual,&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, pp. 116–120, 170, 217&lt;/ref&gt; but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as "ardently heterosexual" and his involvement in the rumours as "somewhat unfair".&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902 an American newspaper alleged that Lord Arthur Somerset, having learned in some way that 19 Cleveland Street was under police surveillance and that he may have been identified as a visitor, contrived to bring the prince to the house on an innocent pretext in the hope that the police, seeing him cross the threshold, would be afraid to take the case any further. The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the prince's fondness for [[buhl furniture]]: he invited him to inspect a buhl cabinet which was in the house, and the prince remained there for no more than five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1902/09/12/page/3/article/assails-kings-dead-son Assails King's Dead Son]", ''Chicago Tribune'', 12 September 1902&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory proposes that, following a renumbering of the street, No. 19 was deleted from the Land Survey to suppress its existence, and that the house is the current No. 18 on the eastern side of the street.&lt;ref&gt;Gwyther, Matthew (21 October 2000) "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/4811529/Inside-story-19-Cleveland-Street.html Inside Story: 19 Cleveland Street]", ''Daily Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glinert, Ed (2003). ''The London Compendium'', Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland Street was indeed renumbered: the southernmost end was originally Norfolk Street. (For example, the current number 22 Cleveland Street, was originally 10 Norfolk Street, and for a time was the home of [[Charles Dickens]].)&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2013/06/10/plaque-unveiled-to-identify-charles-dickens-first-london-home/ Plaque unveiled to identify Charles Dickens first London home]", ''Fitzrovia News'', 10 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, the renumbering of Cleveland Street was ordered in 1867, long before the scandal, by the Metropolitan Board of Works: "the odd numbers, commencing with 1 and ending with 175, being assigned to the houses on the Western side; that the even numbers, commencing with 2 and ending with 140, to those on the Eastern side; that such numbers do commence at the Southern end."&lt;ref&gt;''Minutes of Proceedings of the Metropolitan Board of Works'', July–December 1867, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aShJAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA980&amp;dq=%22cleveland+street%22+%2B+renumbered p. 983]&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Ordnance Survey]] of 1870 also shows No. 19 and its adjacent houses on the street's western side.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey 1870: London (City of Westminster; St Marylebone; St Pancras), National Library of Scotland, http://maps.nls.uk/view/103313021#zoom=5&amp;lat=8658&amp;lon=10908&amp;layers=BT&lt;/ref&gt; In an 1894 Ordnance Survey these properties have been subsumed by the new Middlesex Hospital wing.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey 1894: London, Sheet VII, National Library of Scotland, http://maps.nls.uk/view/101201553#zoom=4&amp;lat=5497&amp;lon=10692&amp;layers=BT&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Developmental stage theories''' are theories that divide [[child development]] into distinct stages which are characterized by qualitative differences in behaviour.&lt;ref name = Hayslip&gt;Hayslip, Bert JR., et al. (2006). Developmental Stage Theories. Chapter in:Michel Hersen &amp; Jay C. Thomas (ed): ''Comprehensive Handbook Of Personality and Psychopathology.'' Retrieved October 14, 2012 [http://www.arseba.org/Library/Psychology%20Complete/Research-Psychology/Abnormal%20psychology/Psychopathology/COMPREHENSIVE%20HANDBOOK%20OF%20PERSONALITY%20AND%20PSYCHOPATHOLOGY%20VOLUME%201%20PERSONALITY%20AND%20EVERYDAY%20FUNCTIONING%20-%20Jay%20C.%20Thomas.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of different views about the way in which psychological and physical development proceed throughout the life span.  In addition to individual differences in development, developmental psychologists generally agree that development occurs in an orderly way and in different areas simultaneously.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Grivas J. &amp; Carter L. "Psychology for South Australia Stage I"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuous versus discontinuous development ==
One of the major controversies in [[developmental psychology]] centres  whether development is continuous or discontinuous. 
Those psychologists who support the ''continuous'' view of development suggest that development involves gradual and ongoing changes throughout the life span, with behaviour in the earlier stages of development providing the basis of skills and abilities required for the next stages.

Not all psychologists, however, agree that development is a continuous process.  Some view development as a ''discontinuous'' process.  They believe development involves distinct and separate stages with different kinds of behaviour occurring in each stage.  This suggests that the development of certain abilities in each stage, such as specific emotions or ways of thinking, have a definite starting and ending point.  However, there is no exact time at which an ability suddenly appears or disappears.  Although some types of thinking, feeling or behaving may seem to appear suddenly, it is more than likely that this has been developing gradually for some time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Stage theories of development rest on the assumption that development is a discontinuous process involving distinct ''stages'' which are characterized by qualitative differences in behaviour. They also assume that the structure of the stages is not variable according to each individual, however the time of each stage may vary individually.&lt;ref name = Hayslip /&gt; Stage theories can be contrasted with continuous theories, which posit that development is an incremental process.&lt;ref name = "White"&gt;White, F., Hayes, B., &amp; Livesey, D. (2005). ''Developmental Psychology: From Infancy to Adulthood.'' NSW:Pearson Education Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of stage theories ==
There are many stage (discontinuous) theories in developmental psychology including:
*[[Don Beck (management consultant)|Don Beck]] and Chris Cowan's [[spiral dynamics]].
*[[Michael Commons]]' [[model of hierarchical complexity]].
*[[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]] expanded on Freud's psychosexual stages, he defined eight stages that describe how individuals relate to their social world.&lt;ref name = "White" /&gt;
*[[James W. Fowler]]'s [[stages of faith development]] theory.
*[[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual stages]] described the progression of an individual's unconscious desires.
*[[Clare W. Graves]]' [[Spiral dynamics|emergent cyclic levels of existence theory]].
*[[Judith Rich Harris]]' [[No Two Alike: Human Nature and Human Individuality|modular theory of social development]].
*[[Robert Kegan]]'s subject–object constructive developmental theory.
*[[Lawrence Kohlberg]]'s [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]] described how individuals developed moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohlberg|first=L.|title=The Measurement of Moral Judgement|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|authorlink=Lawrence Kohlberg |isbn=0-521-32565-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jane Loevinger]], [[Loevinger's stages of ego development|stages of ego development]].

*[[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maslow|first=A. H.|title=Motivation and personality|year=1987|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=New York|isbn=0-06-041987-3|edition=3rd|authorlink=Abraham Maslow}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Maria Montessori]]'s [[Montessori education#Planes of development|planes of development]].
*[[Jean Piaget]]'s [[theory of cognitive development]] described how children represent and reason about the world.&lt;ref name = "White" /&gt;
*[[Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]
*[[Rudolf Steiner]]'s [[Waldorf education#Pedagogy and theory of child development|seven-year phases]], similar to Piaget's stage theory but extending into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lievegoed|first=Bernard|title=Phases: the spiritual rhythms of adult life|year=1997|publisher=Rudolf Steiner Press|location=Forest Row, GB|isbn=1-85584-056-1|url=https://books.google.com.na/books?id=kHrpFamC7XUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of these theories focus primarily on the healthy development of children, others propose stages that are characterized by a maturity rarely reached before old age.

'''Eḷu''', also ''Hela'' or ''Helu'', is a [[Middle Indo-Aryan language]] or [[Prakrit]] of the 3rd century BCE. It is ancestral to the [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] and [[Maldivian language|Dhivehi]] languages. R. C. Childers, in the ''Journal of the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Asiatic Society]]'', states:
{{quote|[Elu] is the name by which is known an ancient form of the Sinhala language from which the modern vernacular of Ceylon is immediately received, and to which the latter bears is of the same relation that the English of today bears to Anglo-Saxon...The name Elu is no other than Sinhala much succeeded, standing for an older form, Hĕla or Hĕlu, which occurs in some ancient works, and this again for a still older, Sĕla, which brings us back to the Pali Sîhala.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases |author1=Henry Yule |author2=A. C. Burnell |author3=William Crooke | page = 344 | year = 2006 | publisher = Asian Educational Services | isbn = 0-7007-0321-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The Pali scholar [[Thomas William Rhys Davids]] refers to Eḷu as "the Prakrit of Ceylon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhys Davids|first1=Thomas William|authorlink1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|title=Buddhist India|date=2007|publisher=T. W. Press|isbn=978-1406756326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hela Havula]] are a modern [[Sri Lanka]]n literary organization that advocate the use of Eḷu terms over [[Sanskritism]]s. Eḷu is often referred to by modern Sinhalese as ''amisra'', Sinhalese for "unmixed".

A feature of Eḷu is its preference for short [[vowel]]s, loss of aspiration and the reduction of compound consonants found frequently in other Prakrits such as [[Pali]].

==Eḷu in comparison with Pali and Sanskrit==
Being a Prakrit, Eḷu is closely related to other Prakrits such as Pali. Indeed, a very large proportion of Eḷu word-stems are identical in form to Pali. The connections were sufficiently well known that technical terms from Pali and Sanskrit were easily converted into Eḷu by a set of conventional phonological transformations. Because of the prevalence of these transformations, it is not always possible to tell whether a given Eḷu word is a part of the old [[Prakrit]] lexicon, or a transformed borrowing from Sanskrit.

===Vowels and diphthongs===
*Sanskrit ''ai'' and ''au'' always monophthongize to Eḷu ''e'' and ''o'', respectively
::Examples: ''maitrī'' → ''met'', ''auṣadha'' → ''osada''

*Sanskrit ''avi'' becomes Eḷu ''e'' (i.e. ''avi'' → ''ai'' → ''e'')
::Example: ''sthavira'' → ''thera''

===Sound changes===

* Initial ''ca'' in Sanskrit and Pali becomes ''s'' or ''h''
::Examples: ''canda'' → ''sa&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;da'', ''ha&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;da''

*  ''P'' if not omitted becomes ''v''
::Examples: ''rūpa'' → ''ruva'', ''dīpa'' → ''diva''

* The Sanskrit sibilants ''ś'', ''ṣ'', and ''s'' merge as Eḷu ''s''
::Examples: ''śaraṇa'' → ''saraṇa'', ''doṣa'' → ''dosa''

* The Sanskrit  ''kti'' becomes ''ti'' or ''vi''
::Examples: ''bhakthi'' → ''bätiya'', ''shakthi'' → ''saviya''

===Compound consonants===

At the beginning of a word only a single consonant can remain
::Examples: ''dharma'' → ''dahama''
::Examples: ''prāna'' → ''pana''

In the middle of a word no group may exceed one consonant
::Examples: ''arta'' → ''aruta''
::Examples: ''danta'' → ''data''

'''Gender mainstreaming''' is the [[public policy]] concept of assessing the different implications for people of different genders of any planned [[policy]] action, including [[legislation]] and [[Program (management)|programmes]], in all areas and levels. Mainstreaming essentially offers a pluralistic approach that values the diversity among people of different genders.

The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The idea has been pushed in the [[United Nations]] development community. The idea was formally featured in 1995 at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], and was cited in the document that resulted from the conference, the [[Beijing Platform for Action]].

== Definition ==
Most definitions of gender mainstreaming conform to the UN [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] formally defined concept:
: Mainstreaming a gender perspective is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve [[gender equality]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/52/plenary/a52-3.htm Report of the Economic and Social Council for 1997]". A/52/3.18 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are different approaches to gender mainstreaming:

''Institutional perspective:''  The ways in which specific organizations adopt and implement mainstreaming policies. This will often involve an analysis of how national politics intersects with international norms and practices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|last=Shepard|first=Laura J.|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Discursive'' ''perspective:'' Queries the ways in which mainstreaming reproduces power relations through language and issue-framing. This approach will often involve looking at documents, resolutions and peace agreements to see how they reproduce the narratives of gender in a political context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These approaches are not necessarily competing, and can be seen as complimentary.

The ways in which approaches are used, however, can also reflect differing feminist theories. For example, ''liberal feminism'' is strongly invoked by mainstreaming through the binary approach of gender in strict relation to the public sphere of policymaking. ''Poststructuralist feminism'' can be seen in mainstreaming thought which seeks to displace gender difference as the sole axis of difference and to highlight the diversity of policy its ramifications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Prioritizing gender equality===

Gender mainstreaming tries, among others, to ascertain a [[gender equality]] perspective across all [[policy]] areas.&lt;ref name="True, Jacqui 2010"&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 371&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacqui True, a Professor of politics and international relations, "[e]very [[policy]] or piece of [[legislation]] should be evaluated from the perspective of whether or not it reduces or increases gender inequalities."&lt;ref name="True, Jacqui 2010"/&gt; This concept of [[gender equality]] is not limited to formal equality, it includes as well equality de facto, which is a more holistic approach to gender [[policy]] in order to tackle the interconnected causes that create an unequal relation between the sexes in all areas of life (work, politics, sexuality, culture, and violence).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", Social Politics 12(3): 417&lt;/ref&gt;

Lombardo notes that "[t]here should be evidence that [[gender equality]] objective and policies of special concern for women (for example, [[social policy]]) have been prioritized in the organization among competing objectives (in terms of financial and human resources, type of measures adopted, voting systems used, and so forth)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Incorporating gender into politics and decision making===

Puechguirbal takes a discursive approach to argue that in order to successfully mainstream a gendered perspective in politics, language needs to be reevaluated and used to change the parameters of how women are perceived.

Historically, documents concerning international agreements, peacekeeping arrangements and legal resolutions have perpetuated stereotypes that disempower women. This can be seen through the use of language, even as simply as in the UN Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration program's (DDR) motto: 'One man, on weapon'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reference of gender issues should be found in all [[policy]] areas. "There must be evidence that the [[mainstream]] political agenda has been reoriented by rethinking and rearticulating [[policy]] ends and means from a gender perspective," Lombardo says, referencing [[Rounaq Jahan]], a political scientists, feminist leader and author.&lt;ref name="Lombardo, E. 2005"&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", ''Social Politics'' 12(3): 417&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] states, "women's equal participation in political life plays a pivotal role in the general process of the advancement of women."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Beijing Platform for Action, G. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, according to the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] "[w]ithout the active participation of women and the incorporation of women's perspective at all levels of decision-making, the goals of equality, development and peace cannot be achieved."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Therefore, Lombardo claims that women and men should be equally represented in any decision-making institution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Charlesworth agrees and believes that every effort should be made to broaden women's participation at all levels of decision-making.&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"&gt;Charlesworth, H., (2005) "Not waving but Drowning: Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the United Nations", 18 ''Harvard Human Rights Journal'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-conflict peace-building (PCPB) ====
An area of policy and decision making that will particularly benefit from gender mainstreaming is post-conflict peace-building, also known as PCPB. Various feminist research has concluded that men and women experience violent conflict differently and moreover, the current policies surrounding PCPB are insufficient in addressing the disadvantaged position of women in male-dominated power structures that are further reinforced by peace-building efforts, both from the domestic and international communities. Gender mainstreaming in PCPB would emphasize the importance of gendered considerations of particular issues that disproportionally affect women in post-conflict settings. This would mean that policy reflected an acknowledgment of the many instances of wartime sexualized violence perpetrated on women, among other issues that (primarily) women face during conflict. A major focus of the effort towards gender mainstreaming in post-conflict peace-building policy is to lessen the international community's inclination towards building a return to 'normal' for the post-conflict region. Much of feminist research has found that returning to 'normal' is of little comfort for women, who were burdened by the patriarchal systems that were in place before conflict broke out. As Handrahan&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handrahan|first=Lori|date=|title=Conflict, gender, ethnicity and post-conflict reconstruction|url=|journal=Security Dialogue|volume=35|pages=429–445|via=University of Victoria library database}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes, the international community involved in much of PCPB "tolerates high levels of violence against women in their own societies." Policy that prioritized gender in its applications and goals would seek to build a society where women are better off than they were before conflict broke out.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Shifts in institutional culture===

Gender mainstreaming can be seen as a process of organizational change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bibbings|first=Sharleene May|title=The politics of mainstreaming in critical perspective|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Pub.|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=9781443835121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming must be institutionalized through concrete steps, mechanisms, and processes in all parts of the organization.&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; According to Lombardo, this change involves three aspects: [[policy]] process, [[policy]] mechanisms; and [[policy]] actors. She explains as follows:

"1. A shift in [[policy]] process means that the process "is reorganized so that ordinary actors know how to incorporate a gender perspective" or that gender expertise is included "as normal requirement for [[policy]]-makers" (Council of Europe 1998, 165&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 1998. Gender Mainstreaming: Conceptual Framework, Methodology and Presentation of Good Practices: Final Report of Activities of the Group of Specialists on Mainstreaming. EG-S-MS. Strasbourg: Council of Europe&lt;/ref&gt;).

2. A shift in [[policy]] mechanism involves (a) the adoption of horizontal cooperation on [[gender]] issues across all [[policy]] areas, levels, and departments; and (b) the use of appropriate [[policy]] tools and techniques to integrate the gender variable in all policies and to monitor and evaluate all policies from a [[gender]] perspective.

3. The range of [[policy]] actors participating in the policy-making process is broadened to include, apart from policy-makers and civil servants, gender experts and civil society."&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", Social Politics 12(3): 417-18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender budgeting ==
{{Main|Gender budgeting}}

Gender budgeting encompasses activities and initiatives aiming at the preparation of [[budget]]s or the analysis of policies and budgets from a gender perspective. It can also be referred to as gender-sensitive budgeting or gender-responsive budgeting. Gender budgeting does not aim at creating separate budgets for women, or only increasing spending on women’s programmes. It is rather concerned with addressing budgetary [[gender inequality]] concerns, as for instance, how gender hierarchies influence budgets, and gender-based unpaid or low paid work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002316/231646e.pdf|title=A Guide for Gender Equality in Teacher Education Policy and Practices|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100069-0|location=|pages=72–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
As Jacqui True says, "[m]ainstreaming was established as a global strategy for achieving [[gender equality]], and in turn for achieving sustainable economic development in the 1995 [[Beijing Platform for Action]] ratified by all [[United Nations]] member states. It is now incumbent upon nation-states and international organizations to carry out gender mainstreaming. As such, mainstreaming has achieved widespread endorsement by individual governments, regional supra-state bodies."&lt;ref&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 369&lt;/ref&gt; What follows is a non-exhaustive list of examples of these endorsements.

===Nicaragua===
The election of 1990 in [[Nicaragua]] brought to office the first female [[president]] in the Americas. On April 25, 1990, [[Violeta Chamorro]] became the first and only woman to defeat a male incumbent presentment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prevost|first=G.|title='The Nicaraguan Revolution: Six Years After The Sandinista Electoral Defeat'|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=1996|volume=17|issue=2|pages=307–327|doi=10.1080/01436599650035707}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This helped to change and mobilize [[mainstream]] [[gender]] structure within [[Nicaragua]]. In 1993 the existing outdated Sandinista Women's organization, the Nicaraguan Institute for Research on Women, was revitalized and renamed by the Chamorro government as the Nicaraguan Institute for Woman (INIM). This was to encourage the involvement of Nicaraguan women in the country's economic, social, cultural, and political development and to promote a change in mainstream gender constructs.&lt;ref name="Isbester 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isbester|first=Katherine|title=Still Fighting: The Nicaraguan Women's movement, 1977-2000,|year=2001|publisher=University of Pittsburgh press|location=Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the INIM aims to institute in all sectors a system of gender-focus indicators and to achieve equal opportunity in all State body programming.&lt;ref name="General Assembly"&gt;{{cite web|last=General Assembly|first=United Nations|title=Nicaraguan Institute for women Instrumental in Mainstream Gender Equality Strategies, Anti-Discrimination,|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/wom1595.doc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the INIM with 62 women's groups held discussions to mobilize their initiatives and form a bill of action. The discussions formed a plan, which defined [[patriarchy]], [[sexism]], and [[gender stereotypes]] to reduce inequality in education, employment, and violence.&lt;ref name="Isbester 2001"/&gt;

Although the Nicaraguan Institute for Women claimed to "have been instrumental in mainstreaming [[gender equality]] principles and strategies into agriculture, socio-economic development, higher education, and sexual and [[domestic violence]] prevention," the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2007 raised several concerns, such as the backlog of important women's rights legislation in the country, the lack of studies on [[abortion]], and the available funds of the Institute.&lt;ref name="General Assembly"/&gt;

===Taiwan===
Under the influence of the UN community, the usage of the term increased in [[Taiwan]] since 2000. Local feminist organizations have different views on gender mainstreaming. Some groups considered that the Commission on Women Rights Promotion under [[Executive Yuan]] should be expanded, while other groups, including the [[National Alliance of Taiwan Women's Associations]], considered that gender mainstreaming is not promotion of women's rights but an assessment of all policies and requires a specific organization.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Fang-Mei. "性別主流化在台灣：從國際發展到在地化實踐". ''第一屆性別研究與公共政策學術研討會'', Taipei:[[Shih Hsin University]]. April 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foundation of Women's Rights Promotion and Development]] (FWRPD) has conducted research on gender mainstreaming and gender equality development, produced gender resources kits for training and education, networked women groups and entrepreneurs, participated in international exchange in [[UN]], [[APEC]] gender related meetings.&lt;ref name="website_apecwln.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apecwln.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/Taiwan%20Women's%20Organizations.pdf |title=Taiwan's Women's Organizations |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=APEC Women Leaders Network |publisher=APEC Women Leaders Network. |access-date=2015-11-15 |quote= }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN Peacekeeping Operations===

The [[United Nations]] began acknowledging the importance of gender mainstreaming as a tool towards achieving [[gender equality]] in the mid-1990s, as outlined in the [[Beijing Platform for Action]] and the Report from the Secretary General to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations, Fourth World Conference on Women|title=Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/pdf/BDPfA%20E.pdf|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=United Nations General Assembly |title=E/1997/66 |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/1997/66 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001054742/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E%2F1997%2F66 |archivedate=2013-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2000, the [[UN Security Council]] passed Resolution 1325,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1325(2000)|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a resolution that called for an enhanced female participation in the prevention, management and resolution of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;True, Jacqui, Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy, International Feminist Journal of Politics, 2010, 373&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peacekeeping]] was an area of particular concern, and the [[Security Council]] recognized "the urgent need to mainstream a gender perspective into [[peacekeeping]] operations."&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 1325, 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Council requested "the [[Secretary-General]], where appropriate, to include in his reporting to the [[Security Council]], progress on gender mainstreaming throughout peacekeeping missions and all other aspects relating to women and girls."&lt;ref&gt;Resolution 1325, 4&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there has been an increase in female peacekeeping personnel. As of 2012, in [[peacekeeping]] operations and special political missions, 29 percent of international and 17 percent of national staff were women. If we compare these figures with the 48 percent representation of women at the [[UN Headquarters]], the participation of women in the [[United Nations Peacekeeping]] operations still faces challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Nations|title=Women in Peacekeeping|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/issues/women/womeninpk.shtml|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===

The equality [[policy]] of the [[European Union]] consists of three pillars: (1) [[anti-discrimination]], (2) [[affirmative action]] policies, and (3) gender mainstreaming.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Calvo, D.|year=2013|title=What is the problem of gender? Mainstreaming gender in migration and development policies in the European Union|location=Gothenburg|publisher=Department of Sociology and Work Science|type=Doctoral Dissertation|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/31823/1/gupea_2077_31823_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

In the 1990s the [[European Union]] officially put gender mainstreaming on their agenda, "fixing the principle in [[treaty]] articles, action programs and communications, and setting up institutional bodies and mechanisms to promote the incorporation of a gender perspective into policymaking."&lt;ref&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 2&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, gender mainstreaming was introduced in 1991 in the European Community as an element of the Third Action Programme on Equal Opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Mark A. and Hafner-Burton, Emilie. 2000. Gender Mainstreaming in the European Union, Harvard Jean Monnet Working Paper 2/000, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the legal basis for gender mainstreaming in European law is Article 8 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU). This article states the following: "In all its activities, the Union shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between men and women".

What follows is a non-exhaustive overview of current gender governance initiatives in the [[European Union]] that encourages gender mainstreaming.

For instance, since 1997 gender mainstreaming has been part of the [[European Employment Strategy]], a concept launched by the [[European Council]]. The [[European Employment Strategy]] requires governments to adopt an approach that complies with the concept of gender mainstreaming, while deciding on employment policies.&lt;ref name="Rubery, Jill 2005"&gt;Rubery, Jill, 2005, Reflections on Gender Mainstreaming: An Example of Feminist Economics in Action?, Feminist Economics 11(3), November 2005, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Alison E. 2008. Too late for gender mainstreaming? Taking stock in Brussels Journal of European Social Policy (2008) 18 (3): 4&lt;/ref&gt; Some concrete examples: new equal opportunities acts requiring mainstreaming (e.g., in France social partners are required to promote gender equality through collective bargaining); mainstreaming or [[gender]] assessment in individual ministries or areas of public services (e.g., in Finland and Sweden); and [[gender]] assessment of all new pieces of legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Rubery, Jill, 2005, Reflections on Gender Mainstreaming: An Example of Feminist Economics in Action?, Feminist Economics 11(3), November 2005, 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jill Rubery, a Professor of comparative employment system at Manchester School of Management, so far "the experience has been mixed: though the argument that increasing women's employment is critical to the achievement of Europe's aspirations for a higher employment rate has been widely accepted, there is a much weaker and more fragile commitment to improving the quality of work available to women."&lt;ref name="Rubery, Jill 2005"/&gt;

A second example is the Transnational Women's Networks.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"&gt;Lang, S., 2009, Assessing Advocacy: European Transnational Women's Networks and Gender Mainstreaming, 12&lt;/ref&gt; As such we can cite the [[European Women's Lobby]] (EWL) as an important women's organization at EU level that was created in 1990. About 2,500 [[NGOs]] of 30 European countries are part of the EWL.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|51}} The [[European Women's Lobby]] encourages "coordination of women's civic groups on the EU stages."&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt; The EWL lobbied for increasing the involvement of women's organizations in the process of gender governance.&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|51}} In addition the EWL has been pushing for "an EU Strategy to promote, implement and facilitate civil society and specifically women's organizations input into the European debate as an essential part of the European social model."&lt;ref&gt;European Women's Lobby. 2005a. Contribution from the European Women's Lobby to the Green Paper on an EU Approach to Managing Economic Migration, COM(2005)811 final, 6&lt;/ref&gt; Another important organization is [[Women in Development Europe]] (WIDE). This network, created in 1985, consists of NGOs, women's organizations, gender experts, and activists active in development. [[Women in Development Europe]] monitors European economic and developmental policies and practices&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|52}}  and is involved at many phases in policy-making activities as knowledge source.&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|52}}

Another [[gender]] governance actor is the [[European Institute for Gender Equality]] (EIGE), established in May 2007. The EIGE has as mandate to "provide expertise, improve knowledge and raise visibility of equality between men and women".&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|53}}

Obviously there are many more initiatives on EU level, to name a few: Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|57}} High Level Group on Gender Mainstreaming,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|58}} Inter-Service Group on Gender Equality,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt; Informal Group of Experts on Gender Equality in Development Cooperation,&lt;ref name="Calvo 2013"/&gt;{{rp|61}} Women in Europe for our Common Future.&lt;ref name="Lang, S. 2009"/&gt;

==Criticism==

===Ineffective results===
Maria Stratigaki, Assistant Professor at the Department of Social Policy of [[Panteion University]], claims that the transformative effect of gender mainstreaming was minimal and its application has led to contradictory results. It opened important opportunities for specific policies in new [[policy]] areas, whereas in some other it diluted [[positive action]]. She also claims that, at least as of 2003, gender mainstreaming has failed to affect core [[policy]] areas or radically transform [[policy]] processes within the European Institutions.&lt;ref name="Stratigaki, M 2005"&gt;Stratigaki, M., (2005) "Gender Mainstreaming vs Positive Action. An Ongoing Conflict in EU Gender Equality Policy", ''European Journal of Women's Studies'' 12 (2): 165-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say that gender mainstreaming has not increased women's participation in decision making. As Charlesworth notes, "[i]n the most readily measurable area, the United Nations' employment of women in professional and managerial posts, progress has been glacial. In 2004, women held 37.4 percent of these positions. The annual growth rate toward the 50 percent target [...] is predicted to be 0.4 percent. On top of this slow growth, there is a considerable hierarchy based on sex. On June 30, 2004, women held 83.3 percent of positions at the lowest professional level, P-1, but just 16.7 percent at the highest staff level, Under-Secretary-General."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; In a similar vein, concerning the [[European Union]], Lombardo reports that as of 2003 women represented only 20 percent of the representatives of the head of state or government the member states, 10 percent of the representatives of national parliaments, 31.25 percent of the representatives of the [[European Parliament]] and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, E., (2005) "Integrating or Setting the Agenda? Gender Mainstreaming in the European Constitution-Making Process", Social Politics 12(3): 422&lt;/ref&gt;

True claims that mainstreaming gender does not end in simply increasing the number of women within a specific institution. It is about changing social consciousness, so that the effects of a policy for both women and men are truly analyzed before they are implemented. While it is necessary for [[feminists]] to engage with mainstream institutions, the ability of gender mainstreaming to deconstruct the embedded masculinization of institutions varies depending on the characteristics of the policy, the political nature of the institution, and the depth of the institution's consultation with civil society and other members of the women's rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;"True, J. (2010) "Mainstreaming Gender in International Relations". ''Gender Matters in Global Politics'' (New York: Routledge) L.J. Shepherd (Ed.) 194"&lt;/ref&gt; The danger of gender mainstreaming is that large compromises can be made for small gains and can lead to what feminist and sociology professor Carol Dines calls "trickle-down [[feminism]]"—i.e., "working to increase the ranks of women in elite jobs without a strategy for wider economic and social change represents a kind of "trickle-down [[feminism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/25/having-it-all-women-anne-marie-slaughter |title='Having it all' looks very different for women stuck in low-paid jobs &amp;#124; Gail Dines &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor implementation===
Charlesworth remarks that "[a]lthough it has not been difficult to encourage the adoption of the vocabulary of mainstreaming, there is little evidence of monitoring or follow-up. A consistent problem for all the organizations that adopted gender mainstreaming is the translation of the commitment into action."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt; She continues: "A review of gender mainstreaming policies implemented under the [[United Nations Development Programme]], [[World Bank]], and [[ILO]] found inadequate budgeting for the gender components of projects, insufficient development of analytical skills, poor supervision of the implementation of gender components and a general lack of political commitment both within the organization and at the country level."&lt;ref name="Charlesworth, H 2005"/&gt;

===Hindering progress===
Stratigaki claims that [[positive action]] was sidelined after the launch of gender mainstreaming as a result of the specific way gender mainstreaming was used by the opponents of [[gender equality]]. According to Stratigaki, "[a]lmost all analyses of [gender mainstreaming] agree that it is a strategy which complements but does not replace previous gender specific equality policies like equal treatment legislation and positive action." However, she states too that "in a hostile gender equality policy environments (i.e. patriarchal structures of institutional organisations or the prevalence of policy objectives contrary to gender equality etc.), [gender mainstreaming] may be conceived and applied as an alternative to positive action and used to downplay the final overall objective of [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="Stratigaki, M 2005"/&gt;

True is of the opinion that in practice, attempts to mainstream gender within international institutions have led to the marginalization and increasing invisibility of gender in each policy area. Anne-Marie Goetz, a Clinical Professor at [[NYU]], and Joanne Sandler, a consultant for gender equality and organizational development, argue that ironically, mainstreaming gender runs the risk of becoming everyone's responsibility, yet nobody's at the same time.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 196"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Gender Mainstreaming in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming can allow those in power who are not genuinely interested in the women's movement to adopt the language of women's rights, a reflection of power politics that becomes more of a tool used to legitimize the actions of governments. Gender mainstreaming then becomes more about advising governments than advancing gender equality.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 198"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. ''Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions''. New York: Routledge. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===

As differences are silenced, the kind of [[feminism]] that is likely to be mainstreamed could be a western, white, or middle class brand of feminism. When mainstreaming decisions within international organizations are made by elites can undermine the input of local women's groups.&lt;ref name=Palmary&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Palmary, I.|author2=Nunez, L.|year=2009|title=The Orthodoxy of Gender Mainstreaming: Reflecting on Gender Mainstreaming as Strategy for Accomplishing the Millennium Development Goals|journal=Journal of Health Management|volume=11|issue=65|pages=65–78|doi=10.1177/097206340901100105}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|72}}

When gender mainstreaming policies are drafted without consulting sections of the women's movement (i.e., women's rights civil society groups), they lack ground level-expertise. [[Policy]] decisions related to gender that are made without consulting sections of the women's movement do not demonstrate a clear political willingness to addressing gender inequality. When institutions reach out to the women's rights movement, it demonstrates transparency, inclusiveness, accountability and the implementation process is more likely to be monitored with diligence.&lt;ref name="True, J., 2010, p. 199"&gt;True, Jacqui (2010). Laura J. Shepherd, ed. Mainstreaming Gender in International Institutions. New York: Routledge. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs), as an attempt at mainstreaming gender into development, were formed with minimal consultation with women's groups. The MDGs have led to a considerable amount of theoretically discourse about the goals but less analysis about how they will be implemented.&lt;ref name=Palmary/&gt;{{rp|78}}

True highlights the tendency for gender mainstreaming to become a guise under which women are used as economic subjects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women are framed in terms of advancing economic growth, as opposed to the inherent normative ideal for women and men to hold equal positions of power in society.

[[File:Global Justice Now's relaunch conference.jpg|thumb|Global Justice Now's director Nick Dearden addresses the crowd at their relaunch conference in 2015]]

'''Global Justice Now''', formerly known as the World Development Movement (WDM), is a membership organisation based in the [[United Kingdom]] which campaigns on issues of [[global justice]] and development in the [[Global South]].

The organisation produces research on topics on the developing world and free trade. Examples include their work against trade deals such as [[TTIP]], or highlighting how [[UK aid]] has been used.&lt;ref name=Name1 /&gt;

Much of their research is aimed at attempting to demonstrate how corporation power, supported by governments, has an adverse effect on those living in poverty.

==Aims==
Its aims are:&lt;ref name=Name2 /&gt;
* To work with, and amplify the voices of, groups that are fighting the takeover of their resources, such as food, water and energy
* To mobilise people in the UK to create change
* To use political systems to control the power of big business

==Organisational structure==

Global Justice Now has a network of local groups as well as individual members, and an office in Edinburgh from which Global Justice Scotland is run.&lt;ref name=Name3 /&gt; It participates in international networks such as the [[Our World is Not for Sale]] network on trade and [[corporate]] [[globalisation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signatories to the OWINFS statement |url=http://www.ourworldisnotforsale.org/signees_ns.asp?offset=-1 |accessdate=2008-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812180029/http://www.ourworldisnotforsale.org/signees_ns.asp?offset=-1 |archivedate=August 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Social Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=WDM in East Africa | url=http://wdmeastafrica.blogspot.com | accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global Justice Now has an associated [[Charitable organization|charity]], ''Global Justice Now Trust'', which funds Global Justice Now’s charitable activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WDM Annual review for 2005 |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/about/annrep/2005/finance.htm |accessdate=2007-02-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218142406/http://www.wdm.org.uk/about/annrep/2005/finance.htm |archivedate=2007-02-18 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Global Justice Now started in 1969 as '[[Action for World Development]]' (AWD).  Many people who were involved in collecting one million signatures on a petition about world development had seen the need for political campaigning which charity law restricted development charities from undertaking.  AWD was formally launched by aid agencies such as Oxfam and Christian Aid, and by churches.

The World Development Movement was formed in 1970, and extended the work of AWD but as a separate body with its own member groups to decide its policies and priorities. Its constitution was subsequently changed to allow individuals as well as local groups to become members.

Global Justice Now was a co-founder of the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in 1992, [[Jubilee 2000]] in 1997, the [[Trade Justice Movement]] in 2000, and the 2005 anti-poverty mobilisation [[Make Poverty History]].

In late 2006, Global Justice Now moved its London offices from Brixton to new premises at 66 Offley Road in Kennington, London.

On the 1st January 2015 the organisation was renamed to ''Global Justice Now'' as part of a wider relaunch.&lt;ref name=Name4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Name5 /&gt;

== Campaign highlights ==

=== Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) ===
Global Justice Now is campaigning against [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership|TTIP]], the proposed [[free trade agreement]] between the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]. It argues that safety regulations, workers’ rights, environmental protection rules and food standards regulations are all threatened by TTIP.&lt;ref name=Name6 /&gt;

=== Climate change ===
Global Justice Now considers climate change to be a [[climate justice]] issue.  In 2009 they successfully campaigned to stop new coal-fired power stations in Kingsnorth, Kent and Hunterston in Ayrshire because the organisation considered any plans for new coal-fired power stations to be incompatible with plans to tackle climate change.&lt;ref name=Name7 /&gt;

From 2010 Global Justice Now ran a campaign on [[climate debt]] opposing the UK government's plans to give money in the form of climate loans to already [[heavily indebted poor countries]] in the global South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/climate-debt-campaign/what-wdm-doing |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205032118/http://www.wdm.org.uk/climate-debt-campaign/what-wdm-doing |archivedate=2012-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Global Justice Now entered into a controversial{{Citation needed|reason=None of the links currently in this paragraph demonstrate any broad public discussion befitting the word 'controversial'.|date=January 2017}} partnership agreement with [[Ecotricity]] from which they benefit financially whereby supporters who switch their energy supply to Ecotricity, leads to a payment of up to £60{{Citation needed|reason=Neither citation at the end of this sentence mentions this figure.|date=January 2017}} to Global Justice Now.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/about-ecotricity/team-eco/our-partners/world-development-movement|title=World Development Movement - About Ecotricity - Ecotricity|website=www.ecotricity.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.globaljustice.org.uk/clean-your-energy|title=Clean up your energy|date=2014-11-20|newspaper=Global Justice Now|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of Ecotricity, [[Dale Vince]] is reported to employ aggressive [[tax avoidance]] strategies to minimise his tax obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11413766/Top-Labour-donor-facing-tax-dodge-accusations.html|title=Top Labour donor facing 'tax dodge' accusations|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This directly conflicts with Global Justice Now's Tax Justice campaigns to hold corporations to account so they pay their fair share of tax in the countries they operate in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globaljustice.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/resources/taxes-on-trial-how-trade-deals-threaten-tax-justice-global-justice-now.pdf|title=Taxes on trial|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Ecotricity employ G4S Utility Services for their meter reading services, a subsidiary of controversial multinational [[G4S]] that is widely reported to be involved in widespread human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecotricity.co.uk/customer-service/give-us-a-meter-reading/meter-reading-agents|title=Meter Reading Agents - Customer Services - Ecotricity|website=www.ecotricity.co.uk|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sacc.org.uk/campaigns/keep-g4s-out-your-house|title=Keep G4S Out of Your House|newspaper=Scotland Against Criminalising Communities|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a social justice organisation Global Justice Now were criticised for indirectly aiding and abetting human rights abuses as a result of their continued relationship with Ecotricity. In response to complaints about Ecotricity's use of G4S, Dale Vince gave assurances that he would end the contract with G4S Utility Services in 2014 and then reneged on his promise when Ecotricity announced it had renewed its contract with G4S Utility Services for another 4-year period from January 2016 to December 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corporatewatch.org/news/2014/aug/11/ecotricity-promises-drop-g4s|title=Ecotricity promises to drop G4S {{!}} Corporate Watch|website=corporatewatch.org|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecotricity.co.uk/customer-service/give-us-a-meter-reading/meter-reading-agents |title=Meter Reading Agents - Customer Services - Ecotricity |date=2015-06-09 |access-date=2016-11-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609021716/http://www.ecotricity.co.uk/customer-service/give-us-a-meter-reading/meter-reading-agents |archivedate=2015-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global Justice Now ended its partnership with Ecotricity in early 2016, following a review over concerns about their association with G4S.{{Citation needed|reason=If this is GJN's response there is no announcement on their website. This entire paragraph of Wiki text seems to be the announcement! The organisation is still listed under its previous name on the Ecotricity website.|date=January 2017}} The organisation gave assurances that their partnership was set up at a time when Ecotricity were the most ethical option to promote to their supporters who were concerned about the environmental and climate impacts of their energy use. They also added that the termination of the partnership was not triggered by any complaints received nor was there any open or public criticism, as implied by this posting.

The first documented case of a psychiatrist addressing the issue of homelessness and mental health was in 1906 by [[Karl Wilmanns]].{{sfnp|Bhugra|2007|p=19}}

==Historical context==

===United States===
In the United States, there are broad patterns of reform within the history of psychiatric care for persons with mental illness.&lt;ref name="Gittelman 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gittelman|first=Martin|title=The Neglected Disaster|journal=International Journal of Mental Health|year=2005|volume=34|issue=2|jstor=41345126}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} These patterns are currently categorized into three major cycles of reform. The first recognized cycle was the emergence of moral treatment and asylums, the second consists of the mental hygiene movement and the psychopathic (state) hospital, and most recent cycle includes [[deinstitutionalization]] and community mental health.&lt;ref name="Goldman 1985"/&gt;{{rp|727}}  In an article addressing the historical developments and reforms of treatment for the mentally ill, Joseph Morrissey and Howard Goldman acknowledge the current regression of public social welfare for mentally ill populations. They specifically state that the "historical forces that led to the transinstitutionalization of the mentally ill from almshouses to the state mental hospitals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have now been reversed in the aftermath of recent deinstitutionalization policies".&lt;ref name="Morrissey 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrissey|first=Joseph|author2=Howard Goldman|title=Care and Treatment of the Mentally Ill in the United States: Historical Developments and Reforms|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1986|volume=484|issue=12|doi=10.1177/0002716286484001002|url=http://ann.sagepub.com/content/484/1/12|pages=12–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}} Ultimately, Morrissey and Goldman argue that while each transition expanded the American mental health system into today's "pluralistic patchwork of public and private" structural efforts, each failed to make lasting effects on the societally debilitating nature of chronic mental illness, including the linked effects of poverty and homelessness.

====Asylums====
{{See|Greyhound therapy}}

Within the context of transforming schemas of moral treatment during the early nineteenth century, the humanitarian focus of public intervention was linked with the establishment of asylums or snake pits&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGY6DqB1HX8&lt;/ref&gt; for treatment of the mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Goldman 1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Howard|author2=Joseph Morrissey|title=The Alchemy of Mental Health Policy: Homelessness and the Fourth Cycle of Reform|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=1985|volume=75|issue=7|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.75.7.727|doi=10.2105/AJPH.75.7.727|pages=727–731|pmid=4003648|pmc=1646312}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|727}} The ideology that emerged in Europe disseminated to America, in the form of a social reformation based on the belief that new cases of insanity could be treated by isolating the ill into "small, pastoral asylums" for humane treatment. These asylums were meant to combine medical attention, occupational therapy, socialization activities and religious support, all in a warm environment.

In America, Friends Asylum (1817) and the Hartford Retreat (1824) were among the first asylums within the private sector, yet public asylums were soon encouraged, with Dorothea Dix as one of its key lobbyists. The effectiveness of asylums was dependent on a collection of structural and external conditions, conditions that proponents began to recognize were unfeasible to maintain around the mid-nineteenth century. For example, with the proliferation of immigrants throughout industrialization, the original purpose of asylums as small facilities transformed into their actualized use as "large, custodial institutions" throughout the late 1840s.&lt;ref name="Morrissey 1986"/&gt;{{rp|15}} Overcrowding severely inhibited the therapeutic capacity, inciting a political reassessment period about alternatives to asylums around the 1870s. The legislative purpose of state asylums soon met the role society had funneled them toward; they primarily became institutions for community protection, with treatment secondary.

====State mental hospitals====
As debates regarding the deteriorating role of American asylums and psychiatry amplified around the turn of the century, new reformation arose. With the founding of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, acute treatment centers like psychopathic hospitals, psychiatric dispensaries and child guidance clinics were created. Beginning with the State Care Act in New York, states began assuming full financial control for the mentally ill, in an effort to compensate for the deprivations of asylums. Between 1903 and 1950, the number of patients in state mental hospitals went from 150,000 to 512,000. Morrissey recognizes that despite persistent problem of chronic mental illness, these state mental hospitals were able to provide a minimal level of care.&lt;ref name="Morrissey 1986"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

====Deinstitutionalization====
Toward the end of World War II, the influx of soldiers diagnosed with "war neurosis" incited a new public interest in community care. In addition to this, the view that asylums and state hospitals exacerbated symptoms of mental illness by being "inherently dehumanizing and antitherapeutic" spread through the public consciousness.  When psychiatric drugs like neuroleptics stabilized behavior and [[milieu therapy]] proved effective, state hospitals began discharging patients, with hope that federal programs and community support would counterbalance the effects of institutionalization. Furthermore, economic responsibility for the disabled began to shift, as religious and non-profit organization assumed the role of supplying basic needs.&lt;ref name="Gittelman 2005"/&gt;{{rp|10}} The modern results of deinstitutionalization show the dissonance between policy expectations and the actualized reality.&lt;ref name="Williams 1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Donald|title=Deinstitutionalization and Social Policy: Historical Perspectives and Present Dilemmas|journal=American Orthopsychiatric Association|year=1980|volume=50|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60–61}}

====Community mental health centers====
In response to the flaws of deinstitutionalization, a reform movement reframed the context of the chronically mentally ill within the lens of public health and social welfare problems. Policy makers intentionally circumvented state mental hospitals by allocating federal funds directly to local agencies. For example, the Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC) Act of 1963 became law, "which funded the construction and staffing of hundreds of federal centers to provide a range of services including partial hospitalization, emergency care, consultation, and treatment." Despite efforts, newly founded community centers "failed to meet the needs of acute and chronic patients discharged in increasing numbers from public hospitals". With decreased state collaboration and federal funding for social welfare, community centers essentially proved unable "to provide many essential programs and benefits", resulting in a growth of homelessness and indigency, or lack of access to basic necessities. It is argued that an over reliance on community health has "left thousands of former patients homeless or living in substandard housing, often without treatment, supervision or social support."&lt;ref name="Goldman 1985"/&gt;{{rp|727–728}}

==Personal factors==

===Neurobiological determinants===
The mental health of homeless populations is significantly worse than the general population, with the prevalence of mental disorders up to four times higher in the former.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shelton|first=Katherine|author2=[[Pamela J. Taylor]] |author3=Adrian Bonner |author4=Marianne van den Bree |title=Risk Factors for Homelessness: Evidence from Population-Based Study|journal=Psychiatric Services|year=2009|volume=60|issue=4|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.60.4.465|url=http://journals.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=100325}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|465}} It is also found that psychopathology and substance abuse often exist before the onset of homelessness, supporting the finding that mental disorders are a strong risk factor for homelessness.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2009"/&gt;{{rp|470}} Ongoing issues with mental disorders such as affective and anxiety disorders, substance abuse and schizophrenia are elevated for the homeless.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2009"/&gt;{{rp|465}}&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martens|first=Willem|title=Homelessness and Mental Disorders: A Comparative Review of Populations in Various Countries|journal=International Journal of Mental Health|year=2002|volume=30|issue=4|jstor=41344992}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} One explanation for homelessness states that "mental illness or alcohol and drug abuse render individuals unable to maintain permanent housing."&lt;ref name="Elliott and Krivo 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Marta|author2=Lauren J. Krivo|title=Structural Determinants of Homelessness in the United States|journal=Social Problems|year=1991|volume=38|issue=1|doi=10.2307/800641|jstor=800641|pages=113–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|114}} One study further states that 10-20 percent of homeless populations have a dual diagnoses, or the co-existence of substance abuse and of another severe mental disorder. For example, in Germany there is a link between alcohol dependence and schizophrenia with homeless populations.&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"/&gt;{{rp|85}}

===Trauma===
There are patterns of biographical experience that are linked with subsequent mental health problems and pathways into homelessness.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2009"/&gt;{{rp|465}} Martens states that reported childhood experiences, described as "feeling unloved in childhood, adverse childhood experiences, and general unhappiness in childhood" seem to become "powerful risk factors" for adult homelessness. For example, Martens emphasizes the salient dimension of familial and residential instability, as he describes the prevalence of foster-care or group home placement for homeless adolescents. He notes that "58 percent of homeless adolescents had experienced some kind of out-of-home placement, running away, or early departure from home."&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"/&gt;{{rp|82}} Moreover, up to 50 percent of homeless adolescents report experience with physical abuse, and almost one-third report sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2009"/&gt;{{rp|465}} In addition to family conflict and abuse, early exposure to factors like poverty, housing instability, and alcohol and drug use all increase one's vulnerability to homelessness.&lt;ref name="Lee 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Barrett|author2=Kimberly Tyler|title=The New Homelessness Revisited|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=2010|volume=36|doi=10.1146/annurev-soc-070308-115940|jstor=25735089|pages=501–521}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once impoverished, the social dimension of homelessness manifests from "long exposure to demoralizing relationships and unequal opportunities."&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"/&gt;{{rp|81}}


===Trauma and Homeless Youth===

Youth experiencing homelessness are more susceptible of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Common psychological traumas experienced by homeless youth include, sexual victimization, neglect, experiences of violence, and abuse. &lt;ref name="Crosby 2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crosby|first=Shantel|author2=Hsun-Ta Hsu|title=Factors that contribute to help-seeking among homeless, trauma-exposed youth: A social-ecological perspective|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|date=2018|volume=93|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.07.015|pages=126-134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal factors==
Draine et al. emphasize the role of social disadvantage with manifestations of mental illness. He states that "research on mental illness in relation to social problems such as crime, unemployment, and homelessness often ignores the broader social context in which mental illness is embedded."&lt;ref name="Draine 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Draine|first=Jeffrey|title=Role of Social Disadvantage in Crime, Joblessness, and Homelessness Among Persons With Serious Mental Illness|journal=Psychiatric Services|year=2002|volume=53|issue=5|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.53.5.565|url=http://journals.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/PSS/4347/565.pdf|pages=565–573}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|566}}

===Social barriers===
{{main|Discrimination against the homeless}}

====Stigma====
Lee argues that societal conceptualizations of homelessness and poverty can be juxtaposed, leading to different manifestations of public stigma. In his work through national and local surveys, respondents tended to deemphasize individual deficits over "structural forces and bad luck" for homeless individuals. In contrast, the respondents tended to associate personal failures more to the impoverished than homeless individuals.&lt;ref name= "Lee 2010"/&gt;{{rp|511}}

Nonetheless, homeless individuals are "well aware of the negative traits imputed to them -- lazy, filthy, irresponsible dangerous -- based on the homeless label." In an effort to cope with the emotional threat of stigma, homeless individuals may rely on one another for "non-judgmental socializing." However, his work continues to emphasize that the mentally ill homeless are often deprived of social networks like this.&lt;ref name= "Lee 2010"/&gt;{{rp|508}}

==== Social Isolation ====
People who are homeless tend to be socially isolated, which contributes negatively to their mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polgar|first=Michael|last2=Watson|first2=Stephanie|year=2012|title=Homelessness|journal=The Gale Encyclopedia of Mental Health|edition=3rd.|volume= 1|pages=766–770|via=Gale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have correlated that those who are homeless and have a strong support group tend to be more physically and mentally healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hwang|first=Stephen W.|last2=Kirst|first2=Maritt J.|last3=Chiu|first3=Shirley|last4=Tolomiczenko|first4=George|last5=Kiss|first5=Alex|last6=Cowan|first6=Laura|last7=Levinson|first7=Wendy|date=2017-01-26|year=|title=Multidimensional Social Support and the Health of Homeless Individuals|journal=Journal of Urban Health|volume=86|issue=5|pages=791–803|doi=10.1007/s11524-009-9388-x|issn=1099-3460|pmc=2729873|pmid=19629703|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the stigma received by the homeless population, another aspect that contributes to social isolation is the purposeful avoidance of social opportunity practiced by the homeless community out of shame of revealing their current homeless state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crisis.org.uk/data/files/publications/LonelinessReport_FINAL.pdf|title=Loneliness and isolation|last=Sanders|first=Ben|date=December 2015|website=Crisis|publisher=Crisis|access-date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social isolation ties directly to social stigma in that homeless socialization outside of the homeless community will affect how the homeless are perceived. This is why homeless individuals talking with those who are not homeless is encouraged since it can combat the stigma that is often associated with homelessness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Racial inequality====
One dimension of the [[Homelessness in the United States|American homeless]] is the skewed proportion of minorities. In a sample taken from Los Angeles, 67.5 percent of the homeless men were African American. In contrast, the Netherlands sample had 42 percent Dutch, with 58 percent of the homeless population from other nationalities.&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"/&gt;{{rp|89}} Furthermore, Lee notes that minorities have a heightened risk of the "repeated exit-and-entry pattern"&lt;ref name= "Lee 2010"/&gt;{{rp|511}}

===Institutional barriers===
Shinn and Gillespie (1994) argued that although substance abuse and mental illness is a contributing factor to homelessness, the primary cause is the lack of [[low-income housing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/homelessness-health.aspx|title=Health &amp; Homelessness|publisher=APA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot and Krivo emphasize the structural conditions that increase vulnerability to homelessness. Within their study, these factors are specifically categorized into "unavailable low-cost housing, high poverty, poor economic conditions, and insufficient community and institutional support for the mentally ill."&lt;ref name="Elliott and Krivo 1991"/&gt;{{rp|116}} Through their correlational analysis, they reinforce the finding that areas with more spending on mental health care have "notably lower levels of homelessness."&lt;ref name="Elliott and Krivo 1991"/&gt;{{rp|122}} Furthermore, their findings emphasize that among the analyzed correlates, "per capita expenditures on mental health care, and the supply of low-rent housing are by far the strongest predictors of homelessness rates."&lt;ref name="Elliott and Krivo 1991"/&gt;{{rp|127}} Along with economic hardship, patterns of academic underachievement also undermine an individual's opportunity for reintegration into general society, which heightens their risk for homelessness.&lt;ref name="Martens 2002"/&gt;{{rp|470}}

On a psychological level, Lee notes that the "stressful nature of hard times (high unemployment, a tight housing market, etc.) helps generate personal vulnerabilities and magnifies their consequences."&lt;ref name="Lee 2010"/&gt; For example, poverty is a key determinant of the relationship between debilitating mental illness and social maladjustment; it is associated with decreased self-efficacy and coping. Moreover, poverty is an important predictor of life outcomes, such as "quality of life, social and occupational functioning, general health and psychiatric symptoms", all relevant aspects of societal stability.&lt;ref name="Draine 2002"/&gt;{{rp|566}} Thus, systemic factors tend to compound mental instability for the homeless. Tackling homelessness involves focusing on the risk factors that contribute to homelessness as well as advocating for structural change.

==Consequences==

===Incarceration===
It is argued that persons with mental illness are more likely to be arrested, simply from a higher risk of other associated factors with incarceration, such as substance abuse, unemployment, and lack of formal education. Furthermore, when correctional facilities lack adequate coordination with community resources upon release, the chances of recidivism increase for persons who are both homeless and suffering from a mental illness.  Every state in the United States [[Mentally ill prisoners in the United States|incarcerates more individuals with severe mental illness than it hospitalizes]]. Incarcerations are due to lack of treatments such as psychiatric hospital beds.&lt;ref name="Draine 2002"/&gt;{{rp|566}} Overall, according to Raphael and Stoll, over 60 percent of United States jail inmates report mental health problems.&lt;ref name="Raphael and Stoll 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raphael|first=Steven|author2=Michael Stoll|title=Assessing the Contribution of the Deinstitutionalization of the Mentally Ill to Growth in the U.S. Incarceration Rate|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|date=2013|volume=42|issue=1|url=: https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/667773}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|189}} Estimates from the Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities (2004) and the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (2002) report that the prevalence for severe mental illness (the psychoses and bipolar/manic-depressive disorders) is 3.1-6.5 times the rate observed for the general population.&lt;ref name="Raphael and Stoll 2013"/&gt;{{rp|192}} In relation to homelessness, it is found that 17.3 percent of inmates with severe mental illness experienced a homeless state before their incarceration, compared to 6.5 percent of undiagnosed inmates.&lt;ref name="Raphael and Stoll 2013"/&gt;{{rp|197}} The authors argue that a significant portion of deinstitutionalized mentally ill were transitioned into correctional facilities, by specifically stating that "transinstitutional effect estimates suggest that deinstitutionalization has played a relatively minor role in explaining the phenomenal growth in U.S. incarceration levels."&lt;ref name="Raphael and Stoll 2013"/&gt;{{rp|190}}

==Evidence based remediation practices==
*Integrated service system, between and within agencies in policy making, funding, governance and service delivery.
*Low barrier housing with support services.
*Building Assertive Community Teams (ACT) and Forensic Assertive Community Teams (FACT). 
*Assisted Community Treatment (ACT) 
*Outreach services that identify and connect homeless to the social service system and help navigate the complex, fragmented web of services.
*A community based project funding with collaborations between individuals and organizations.

==Modern responses==
Through longitudinal comparisons of sheltered homeless families and impoverished domiciled families, there are a collection of social buffers that slow one's trajectory toward homelessness. A number of these factors include "entitlement income, a housing subsidy, and contact with a social worker."&lt;ref name="Lee 2010"/&gt;{{rp|513}}

Modern efforts to reduce homelessness include "housing-first models", where individuals and families are placed in permanent homes with optional wrap-around services.&lt;ref name="Lee 2010"/&gt;{{rp|514}} Furthermore, this effort is less expensive than the cost of institutions that serve tangled needs of the homeless, such as emergency shelters, mental hospitals and jails. Overall, this alternative approach has shown positive outcomes. For example, one study reports an 88 percent housing retention rate for those in Housing First, compared to 47 percent using traditional programs.&lt;ref name="Raphael and Stoll 2013"/&gt;{{rp|128}}

Additionally, a review of permanent supportive housing and case management on health found that interventions using “housing-first models” can improve health outcomes among chronically homeless individuals, many of whom suffer from substance use disorders and severe mental illness. Improvements include positive changes in self-reported mental health status, substance use, and overall well-being. These models can also help reduce hospital admissions, length of stay in inpatient psychiatric units, and emergency room visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rapid Evidence Review: What Housing-related Services and Supports Improve Health Outcomes among Chronically Homeless Individuals?|url=http://www.academyhealth.org/Programs/content.cfm?ItemNumber=19350|website=AcademyHealth: Advancing Research, Policy and Practice|publisher=AcademyHealth|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919022156/http://www.academyhealth.org/Programs/content.cfm?ItemNumber=19350|archivedate=2016-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strides have also been made to dress the issue of social isolation within the homeless community.

At last count 3,000 of the 500,000 residents in Sonoma County were homeless.  Of those 3,000 roughly 35% reported suffering from mental illness, and each year these numbers continue to rise.  Massive cuts to funding and facility closures throughout the area have forced these individuals to find treatment at local emergency rooms and even the county jail.  This proves to be very costly for the county, and a very temporary fix for those in the throes of a mental health crises.  Mental illness is never cured after one hospital visit, but rather requires continual treatment and care far beyond a crisis.  Studies have shown that long-term treatment can improve the quality of life for many individuals and can reduce the number of homeless in the community.  Uninterrupted assistance greatly increases the chances of living independently and greatly reduces the chances of homelessness and incarceration &lt;ref&gt;Yoon, Bruckner, &amp; Brown, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;.
Fear surrounds the introduction of mentally ill homeless housing and treatment centers into neighborhoods, as they are often associated with increased drug use and criminal activity.  Studies show that this is not necessarily the case.  One such study was conducted to evaluate the benefits of the Housing First model, which focuses on rapid rehousing in permanent accommodations without sobriety or treatment requirements but facilitates access to treatment resources in order to help individuals attain their mental health/sobriety goals after being housed.  Mentally ill homeless individuals with criminal records were studied over a 2-year period, and after being placed in the Housing First program only 30% re-offended. Overall results of the study showed a large reduction in re-conviction, increased public safety, and a reduction in crime rates &lt;ref&gt;Somers, Rezansoff, Moniruzzaman, Palepu, &amp; Patterson, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. A significant decline in drug use was also seen with the implementation of the Housing First model.  A study was conducted that showed a 50% increase in housing retention and a 30% increase in methadone treatment retention in program participants &lt;ref&gt;Palepu, Patterson, Moniruzzaman, Frankish, &amp; Somers, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The mentally ill make up a significant portion of the homeless population in Sonoma County, and without long term treatment options they are forced into a cycle of living that puts both themselves and the community at risk.  Greatly improving their long-term treatment options can lead to permanent and stable living environments which can reduce the homeless population, improve crime rates, and increase overall public safety.

==Conclusion==
For some individuals, the pathways into homelessness may be upstream. E.g. issues such as housing, income level, or employment status. For others, the pathways may be more personal or individual. E.g. issues such as compromised mental health and well ‐ being, mental illness, and substance abuse. Many of these personal and upstream issues are interconnected.

{{Culture of Canada}}
'''''Hoser''''' or '''''hose-head''''' is both a slang term and a derogatory term, originating from [[Canada]] and used primarily by those imitating [[Canadians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0twBxkXe5DsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Hoser+Canadian+slang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bdUSTdDsJI3CnAfQn8iADg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=Toronto|first1=Charles |last1=Rawlings-Way|first2= Natalie |last2=Karneef|page=20|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|year=2007|isbn=978-1-74059-835-4 |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not often used by Canadians, but it is sometimes used as typical Canadian slang by others.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}{{dubious|date=December 2017}}

The term ''hoser'' gained popularity from the comedic skits by [[Rick Moranis]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] (playing the characters of [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]]) in ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''’s "[[List of Bob and Doug McKenzie appearances on SCTV|The Great White North]]" segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g80P_4v4QbIC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=Hoser+Canadian+slang&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PdYSTdX7C9XnnQewoYWMBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=The New Hacker's Dictionary|first=Eric S.|last=Raymond|page=249|publisher=MIT Press|year=1999|edition=3rd|isbn=0-262-18178-9|accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters also used the verb 'to hose' as a synonym for 'to swindle'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNRlcjz3acU|title=Great White North: Mouse in a Bottle|work=SCTV|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The origin of the term is unclear. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records the first use in writing as being a 1981 ''[[Toronto Star]]'' article about the McKenzie brothers, and there is no clear evidence that the term was in use before then. Nonetheless, the term has spawned several popular [[false etymology|false etymologies]].&lt;ref name="mentalfloss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Does the Word "Hoser" Come From?|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/51399/where-does-word-hoser-come|author=Sean Hutchinson|publisher=[[Mental Floss]]|date=July 1, 2013|accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular origin story holds that in outdoor [[ice hockey]] before [[ice resurfacer]]s, the losing team in a hockey game would have to hose down the rink after a game to make the ice smooth again. Thus the term ''hoser'' was synonymous with ''loser''.&lt;ref name="mentalfloss"/&gt; Another suggestion for the origin of the term involves [[farmer]]s of the [[Canadian Prairies]] who would [[siphon]] gasoline from farming vehicles with a hose during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref name="mentalfloss"/&gt; "Hosed" is also a euphemism for [[alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]] in Canadian English, and by extension a hoser is one who is drunk.

Another possible origin may stem from loggers' slang, where "hoosier" referred contemptuously to an untrained, inept, or slack worker.&lt;ref&gt;Elrick B Davis, "Paul Bunyan Talk," American Speech, Vol. 17, No. 4 (Dec., 1942), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''hoser'' was used frequently on the U.S. sitcom ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' in relation to main character [[Robin Scherbatsky]], who was a native of Canada.

The term ''hoser'' has been used particularly in American television as a way to pretend to be a Canadian. A classic example of this can be seen on ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' "[[Yippie Kayak]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61861">'''Internet activism''' (also known as '''web activism''', '''online activism''', '''digital campaigning''', '''digital activism'', ''online organizing''', '''electronic advocacy''', '''c'e-campaigning''', and '''e-activism''') is the use of electronic communication technologies such as [[social media]], [[e-mail]], and [[podcasts]] for various forms of [[activism]] to enable faster and more effective communication by [[citizen]] [[social movement|movements]], the delivery of particular information to large and specific audiences as well as coordination. [[Internet]] technologies are used for cause-related [[fundraising]], [[community building]], [[lobbying]], and [[organizing (management)|organizing]]. A digital activism campaign is "an
organized public effort, making collective claims on a target authority, in which civic initiators or supporters use digital media."&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-activism.org/download/1270/ Edwards, Frank, Philip N.

== Types ==
Sandor Vegh divides online activism into three main categories: '''Awareness/advocacy''', '''organization/mobilization''', and '''action/reaction'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KHCjMkNRAkYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=sandor%20vegh%20online%20activism%20categories&amp;ots=NvYT6OGWNj&amp;sig=vT1cUU7btaEJh4kHpNpW459UzCs#v=onepage&amp;q=sandor%20vegh%20online%20activism%20categories&amp;f=false|title=Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice|first1=Martha|last1=McCaughey|first2=Michael D.|last2=Ayers|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other ways of classifying types of online activism, such as by the degree of reliance on the Internet. Thus, Internet sleuthing or hacking could be viewed as purely online forms of activism, whereas the Occupy Wall Street movement was only partially online.

The Internet is a key resource for independent activists, or E-activists, particularly those whose message may run counter to the mainstream. "Especially when a serious violation of [[human rights]] occurs, the Internet is essential in reporting the atrocity to the outside world."&lt;ref&gt;"Classifying Forms of Online Activism: The Case of Cyberprotests Against the World Bank" in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and PRACTICE,'' Eds. Ayers, Michael D., [[Martha McCaughey|Mccaughey, Martha]], pp. 72-73. Copyright 2003, Routledge, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; [[Listserv]]s like BurmaNet and Freedom News Group help distribute news that would otherwise be inaccessible in these countries.

Internet activists also pass on E-petitions to be sent to the government and public and private organizations to protest against and urge for positive policy change in areas from the [[arms industry|arms trade]] to [[animal testing]]. Many non-profits and charities use these methods, emailing petitions to those on their email list and asking people to pass them on. The Internet also enables organizations such as [[NGO]]s to communicate with individuals in an inexpensive and timely manner. Gatherings and [[protest]]s can be organized with the input of the organizers and the participants. [[Lobbying]] is also made easier via the Internet, thanks to [[e-mail bomb|mass e-mail]] and its ability to broadcast a message widely at little cost. Vegh's concept of organization/mobilization, for example, can refer to activities taking place solely online, solely offline but organized online, or a combination of online and offline. Mainstream [[social networking websites|social-networking sites]], most noticeably [[Facebook.com]], are also making e-activist tools available to their users.  An active participatory culture is enabled by the communities on social networking sites because they permit communication between groups that are otherwise unable to communicate. In the article "Why We Argue about Virtual Community: A Case Study of the Phish.net Fan Community," Nessim Watson stresses the necessity of communication in online communities. He even goes as far as to say that "Without ongoing communication among its participants, a community dissolves". The constant ability to communicate with members of the community enriches online community experiences and redefines the word community.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Nessim "Why We Argue about Virtual Community: A Case Study of the Phish.net Fan Community" pp. 103-104. SAG Publications 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[denial-of-Service attack]]s, the taking over and vandalizing of a website, uploading [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], and sending out [[e-mail bomb]]s (mass e-mailings) are also examples of Internet activism. For more examples of these types of subversive action, see [[hacktivism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Classifying Forms of Online Activism" in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice,'' pp. 71-95. Copyright 2003, Routledge, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hashtag activism===
{{Main article|Hashtag activism}}
Hashtag activism is the use of [[hashtag]]s for fighting or supporting a cause through the usage of social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29047/hashtag-activism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use has been associated with the [[2014 Chibok kidnapping]], with hopes that it would help keep the story in the news and raise international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/10/michelle-obama-nigeria-presidential-address | title=Michelle Obama raises pressure over kidnapped schoolgirls | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hashtag itself has received 2 million retweets.

One example of the powerful rise of hashtag activism can be seen in the black feminist movement's use of hashtags to convey their cause. The famous hashtag "IamJada" was an internet backlash to the mocking "#Jadapose" that went viral, ensuing after a sixteen-year-old girl Jada Smart was photographed following her gang rape &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Digital Defense: Black Feminists Resist Violence With Hashtag Activism|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, a hashtag was employed to convey a powerful anti-rape message.

== Development processes ==

Exploring the dynamics of online activism for expressing resistance to a powerful organization, a [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772714000426 study] published in [http://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-organization/ Information and Organization] developed a critical mass approach to online activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghobadi, S., Clegg, S.|title=‘these days will never be forgotten’: Critical Mass Approach to Online Activism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471772714000426|website=Information and Organization|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/j.infoandorg.2014.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were integrated in a four-year longitudinal process model that explains how online activism started, generated societal outcomes, and changed over time. The model suggests that online activism helped organize collective actions and amplify the conditions for revolutionary movements to form. Yet, it provoked elites’ reactions such as Internet filtering and surveillance, which do not only promote self-censorship and generate digital divide, but contribute to the ultimate decline of activism over time. The process model suggests a complex interplay among stakeholders’ interests, opportunities for activism, costs and outcomes that are neither foreseen nor entirely predictable. The authors challenge universal access to the Internet as a convenient and cost-free forum for practicing social activism by organizational stakeholders (customers, employees, outside parties). In fact, the technology enablers of social activism also enable its filtering and repression and thus more extreme states of information asymmetry may result in which powerful elites preserve their status and impose a greater digital divide.

In one study, a discussion of a developmental model of political mobilization is discussed. By citizens joining groups and creating discussion, they are beginning their first stage of involvement. Progressively, it is hoped that they will begin signing petitions online and graduating to offline contact as long as the organization provides the citizen with escalating steps of involvement (Vitak et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Vitak, J., Zube, P., Smock, A., Carr, C. T., Ellison, N., &amp; Lampe, C. (2011). It's Complicated: Facebook Users' Political Participation in the 2008 Election. Cyberpsychology, Behavior &amp; Social Networking, 14(3), 107-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of the mass media's centrality has been highly contested, with some people arguing that it promoted the voices of marginalized groups while others believe it sends forth the messages of the majority alone, leaving minority groups to have their voices robbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Apparently They Don’t Like Succinct and Articulate’: Journalists, Activists, and the Battle over News|journal=Soundbitten: The Perils of Media-Centered Political Activism|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of early activism ==
One of the earliest known uses of the Internet as a medium for activism was that around Lotus MarketPlace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpsr.org/prevsite/conferences/cfp91/culnan.html/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 1990, [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] announced a [[direct mail marketing|direct-mail marketing]] [[database]] product that was to contain name, address, and spending habit information on 120 million individual U.S. citizens. While much of the same data was already available, privacy advocates worried about the availability of this data within one database. Furthermore, the data would be on [[CD-ROM]], and so would remain fixed until a new CD-ROM was issued.

In response, a mass e-mail and E-bulletin-board campaign was started, which included information on contacting [[Lotus Software|Lotus]] and [[form letter]]s. Larry Seiler, a [[New England]]-based computer professional, posted a message that was widely reposted on newsgroups and via e-mail: "It will contain a LOT of personal information about YOU, which anyone in the country can access by just buying the discs. It seems to me (and to a lot of other people, too) that this will be a little too much like [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|big brother]], and it seems like a good idea to get out while there is still time."Over 30,000 people contacted Lotus and asked for their names to be removed from the database. On January 23, 1991, Lotus announced that it had cancelled MarketPlace.&lt;ref&gt;Gurak, L.J. (1997). Persuasion and Privacy in Cyberspace: The Online Protests over Lotus MarketPlace and the Clipper Chip. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, a survey article about online activism around the world, from [[Croatia]] to the [[United States]], appeared in ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine, with several activists being quoted about their projects and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The earliest example of mass emailing as a rudimentary form of [[DDoS]] occurred on Guy Fawkes Day 1994, when the [[Intervasion of the UK]] began email-bombing John Major's cabinet and UK parliamentary servers in protest against the [[Criminal Justice Bill]], which outlawed outdoor rave festivals and "music with a repetitive beat"

In 1995–1998, Z magazine offered courses online through Left Online University, with lessons on "Using the Internet for Electronic Activism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/pen-l@galaxy.csuchico.edu/msg06511.html |title=(PEN-L:700) USE the INTERNET to CHANGE THE WORLD: An Online Course for Activists |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=1995-10-08 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of [[cyber-dissidence]] and activism per se, that is, in its modern-day form, may have been inaugurated by Dr. Daniel Mengara, a Gabonese scholar and activist living in political exile in New Jersey in the United States. In 1998, he created a Website in French whose name ''Bongo Doit Partir'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bdpgabon.org/ Bongo Doit Partir]'' (Bongo Must Go)&lt;/ref&gt; was clearly indicative of its purpose: it encouraged a revolution against the then 29-year-old regime of Omar Bongo in Gabon. The original URL, http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/ |title=Bongo Doit Partir &amp;#124; Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau |publisher=Globalwebco.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to redirect to http://www.bdpgabon.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdpgabon.org |title=Bongo Doit Partir &amp;#124; Pour la Construction d'un Gabon nouveau |publisher=Bdpgabon.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 2000. Inaugurating what was to become common current-day practice in the politically involved blogosphere, this movement's attempt at rallying the Gabonese around revolutionary ideals and actions has ultimately been vindicated by the 2011 Tunisian and Egyption revolutions, where the Internet has proven to be an effective tool for instigating successful critique, opposition, and revolution against dictators. In July 2003, Amnesty International reported the arrest of five Gabonese known-to-be members of the cyber-dissident group ''Bongo Doit Partir''. The five members were detained for three months (See: Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/001/2003/en |title=Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2003-08-12 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AFR26/004/2003/en |title=Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2003-10-15 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Another well-known example of early Internet activism took place in 1998, when the [[Mexico|Mexican]] rebel group [[EZLN]] used decentralized communications, such as cell phones, to network with [[developed world]] activists and help create the [[anti-globalization]] group [[Peoples Global Action]] (PGA) to protest the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-bulletin.org/IBMEF_1_word%206%20files/pablo_rev.htm |title=A world of many worlds |publisher=Iran-bulletin.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PGA continued to call for "global days of action" and rally support of other anti-globalization groups in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/en/pgainfos/history.htm |title=www.agp.org – Brief history of PGA |publisher=Nadir.org |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, a worldwide network of Internet activist sites, under the umbrella name of [[Indymedia]], was created "for the purpose of providing grassroots coverage of the WTO protests in [[Seattle]]" in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/en/static/about.shtml |title=Independent Media Center – www.indymedia.org – ((( i ))) |publisher=Indymedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line --&gt; |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2005/03/11/17262451.php |title=Media Activism, Indymedia History, Mar. 11, 2005 |publisher=Indybay.org |date=2005-03-11 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Jackie|date=2001|title=Globalizing Resistance: The Battle of Seattle and the Future of Social Movements|url=|journal=Mobilization: An International Journal|volume=6(1)|pages=1-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dorothy Kidd quotes Sheri Herndon in a July 2001 telephone interview about the role of the Internet in the anti-[[WTO]] protests: "The timing was right, there was a space, the platform was created, the Internet was being used, we could bypass the corporate media, we were using [[open publishing]], we were using [[multimedia]] platforms. So those hadn't been available, and then there was the beginning of the [[anti-globalization movement]] in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;"Indymedia.org: A New Communications Common in ''Cyberactivism: Online Activism in Theory and Practice'' pp. 59.

In the UK, in 1999, the Government introduced a new employment tax called IR35. One of the first online trade associations was created to campaign against it. Within weeks they had raised £100,000 off the Internet from individuals who had never even met. They became a fully formed trade association called the Professional Contractors Group, which two years later had 14,000 members all paying £100 each to join. They presented the first ever e-petition to Parliament and organized one of the first flash mobs when using their database, to their surprise and others, 1,000 came in their call to lobby Parliament. They later raised £500,000 from the Internet to fund an unsuccessful High Court challenge against the tax, though ultimately they secured some concessions. Their first external affairs director, Philip Ross, has written a history of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomtofreelance.blogspot.co.uk/ Freedom to Freelance – the online revolution and the fight against IR35] (Philip Ross, Lulu June 2012), {{ISBN|978-1-4717-3575-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The possibilities of online activism ==

Internet activism has had the effect of causing increased collective action among people, as found by Postmes and Brunsting (2002), who discovered a tendency among internet users to rely on internalized group memberships and social identities in order to achieve social involvement online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rodrigo_Sandoval_Almazan/publication/264827018_Towards_cyberactivism_20_Understanding_the_use_of_social_media_and_other_information_technologies_for_political_activism_and_social_movements/links/565bcad908aeafc2aac622a0.pdf|title=Towards cyberactivism 2.0? Understanding the use of social media and other information technologies for political activism and social movements}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Internet is "tailor-made for a populist, insurgent movement," says [[Joe Trippi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slais.ubc.ca/courses/libr500/06-07-wt1/www/M_Holle-WWW/votepairing.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204150800/http://www.slais.ubc.ca/COURSES/libr500/06-07-wt1/www/M_Holle-WWW/votepairing.htm |archivedate=2008-02-04 |format=PDF |title=Citizen 2.0: How the Internet Shapes Citizen Participation}}&lt;/ref&gt; who managed the [[Howard Dean presidential campaign, 2004|Howard Dean campaign]]. In his campaign memoir, ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,'' Trippi notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Internet's] roots in the [[open-source]] [[ARPAnet]], its [[hacker culture]], and its decentralized, scattered architecture make it difficult for big, establishment candidates, companies and media to gain control of it. And the establishment loathes what it can't control. This independence is by design, and the Internet [[community]] values above almost anything the distance it has from the slow, [[homogeneous]] stream of [[United States|American]] commerce and culture. Progressive candidates and companies with forward-looking vision have an advantage on the Internet, too. [[Television]] is, by its nature, a nostalgic [[Media (communication)|medium]]. Look at [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980|Ronald Reagan's campaign]] ads in the 1980s – they were masterpieces of nostalgia promising a return to America's past glory and [[prosperity]]. The Internet, on the other hand, is a forward-thinking and forward-moving medium, embracing change and pushing the envelope of [[technology]] and [[communication]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Use in political campaigns ===

When discussing the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]] candidates, Carol Darr, director of the [[Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet]] at [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], said of the candidates which benefited from use of the Internet to attract supporters: "They are all charismatic, outspoken mavericks and insurgents. Given that the Internet is interactive and requires an affirmative action on the part of the users, as opposed to a passive response from TV users, it is not surprising that the candidate has to be someone people want to touch and interact with."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.meetup.com/archives/000456.html  "Website Reels In Political Newbies"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20031005042314/http://press.meetup.com/archives/000456.html |date=2003-10-05 }} Hanstad, Chelsie Salisbury, Bill Pioneer Press, St. Paul, MO accessed February 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A more decentralized approach to campaigning arose, in contrast to a top-down, message-focused approach usually conducted in the mainstream. "The mantra has always been, 'Keep your message consistent. Keep your message consistent,'" said John Hlinko, who has participated in Internet campaigns for [[MoveOn.org]] and the electoral primary campaign of [[Wesley Clark]]. "That was all well and good in the past. Now it's a recipe for disaster ... You can choose to have a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] structure that's really doctrinaire and that's really opposed to grassroots. Or you can say, 'Go forth. Do what you're going to do.' As long as we're running in the same direction, it's much better to give some freedom."&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.meetup.com] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040924185855/http%3A//press.meetup.com/|date=2004-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-thirds of Internet users under the age of 30 have a SNS, and during the 2008 election, half of them used a SNS site for candidate information (Hirzalla, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Hirzalla, F., van Zoonen, L., &amp; de Ridder, J. (2011). Internet Use and Political Participation: Reflections on the Mobilization/Normalization Controversy. Information Society, 27(1), 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-traditional activism ===

The Internet has become the catalyst for protests such as [[Occupy Wall Street]] and the [[Arab Spring]] as those involved have increasingly relied on social media to organize and stay connected.
In [[Myanmar]], online news paper Freedom News Group has leaked some government corruption and fuel to protests.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/nyregion/wall-street-occupiers-protesting-till-whenever.html?_r=1&amp;ref=occupywallstreet | work=The New York Times | first1=N.

In 2017, the [[Sleeping Giants]] cyberactivist group, among others, launched a boycott campaign against controversial, conservative webpage [[Breitbart News]], getting more than 2,000 organizations to remove it from ad buys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40411086/activists-push-back-against-the-platforms-that-quietly-empower-hate-groups|title=Activists Are Pushing Back Against Tech Platforms That Quietly Empower Hate Groups|date=2017-05-09|work=Fast Company|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/boycott-breitbart-lyft-hewlett-packard-t-mobile-autodesk-uber-amazon/|title=Lyft, HP won't advertise on Breitbart.

=== Corporate activism ===
Corporations are also using Internet activist techniques to increase support for their causes. According to Christopher Palmeri with ''BusinessWeek'' Online, companies launch sites with the intent to positively influence their own public image, to provide negative pressure on competitors, to influence opinion within select groups, and to push for policy changes.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Palmeri, [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_02/c3865004_mz003.htm Up Front: How To Make A Corporate Cause Click], BusinessWeek Online, January 12, 2004.  retrieved October 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The clothing manufacturer, [[American Apparel]] is an example: The company hosts a website called [[Legalize LA]] that advocates [[immigration reform]] via blog, online advertising, links to news stories and educational materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanapparel.net/contact/legalizela/ |title=Legalize LA subpage |publisher=Americanapparel.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723013143/http://americanapparel.net/contact/legalizela/ |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news

Corporate methods of information dissemination is labelled "[[astroturfing]]," as opposed to "grassroots activism," due to the funding for such movements being largely private.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificnews.org/jinn/stories/2.01/960105-astroturf.html Anderson, Walter T.

=== Religious activism ===

[[Cybersectarianism]] is a new organizational form which involves: "highly dispersed small groups of practitioners that may remain largely anonymous within the larger social context and operate in relative secrecy, while still linked remotely to a larger network of believers who share a set of practices and texts, and often a common devotion to a particular leader.  Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders.  Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in collective study via email, on-line chat rooms and web-based message boards."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Thornton, "The New Cybersects: Resistance and Repression in the Reform era. " In Elizabeth Perry and Mark Selden, eds., ''Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance'' (second edition) (London and New York: Routledge, 2003), pp. 149-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental activism===
One of the earliest books on activism was Don Rittner's "Ecolinking - Everyone's Guide to Online Environmental Information," Published by Peachpit Press in 1992.  Rittner, an environmental activist from upstate New York, spent more than 20 years researching and saving the Albany Pine Barrens.  He was a beta tester for America Online and ran their Environmental Forum for the company from 1988 to when it launched in 1990.  He took his early environmental knowledge and computer savvy and wrote what was called the bible of the online environmental community.  It showed new Net users how to get online, find environmental information, connect to environmentalists around the world, and how to use those resources to save the planet.

=== Sexual Assault activism ===
Activism against sexual assault can be led on the internet, where individuals may feel comfortable talking about controversial topics. One such movements is the #NotGuilty movement. This movement began in April 2015 with Ione Wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://notguiltycampaign.co.uk/about/|title=About - #NotGuilty|work=#NotGuilty|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She shared a "letter to her attacker" in her college paper. The letter described how she was sexually assaulted and how she chose to respond and build from that point in her life. At the end of the letter she urged readers to send a letter back describing their own sexual assault experience with the hashtag #notguilty. She received so many letters from locals that she decided to create a website, this caused global attention and inspired many to share their stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wells|first=Ione|title=How we talk about sexual assault online|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/ione_wells_how_we_talk_about_sexual_assault_online|language=en|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Me Too movement]] is a similar movement that started in Hollywood. [[Tarana Burke]] created the phrase to "empower women through empathy" and [[Alyssa Milano]] helped spread the use of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://metoomvmt.org/|title=You Are Not Alone|last=Alone|first=You Are Not|website=You Are Not Alone|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/10/19/the-woman-behind-me-too-knew-the-power-of-the-phrase-when-she-created-it-10-years-ago/|title=The woman behind ‘Me Too’ knew the power of the phrase when she created it — 10 years ago|last=Ohlheiser|first=Abby|date=2017-10-19|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase was first used to demonstrate the amount of sexual assault that happens to young actresses and actors in Hollywood. It soon spread to apply to all forms of sexual assault, especially in the work place. These movements were intended to create an outlet for men and women to share their experiences with those with similar views without blame or guilt. They brought widespread attention to sexual assault and caused much controversy about changes that should be made accordingly. &lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fonda|first=Jane|date=January 1, 2018|title=After #metoo|url=|journal=Nation|volume=306|pages=22-25|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism around movements such as these centers on concerns about whether or not participants are being dishonest for their own gain or are misinterpreting acts of kindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://womensenews.org/2018/01/beware-the-metoo-backlash-it-masks-ugly-lies-about-women/|title=Beware the #MeToo Backlash—It Masks Ugly Lies About Women|work=Women's eNews|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on everyday political discussions ==

According to some observers, the Internet may have considerable potential to reach and engage opinion leaders who influence the thinking and behavior of others. According to the Institute for Politics, Democracy &amp; the Internet, what they call "Online Political Citizens" (OPCs) are "seven times more likely than average citizens to serve as opinion leaders among their friends, relatives and colleagues… Normally, 10% of Americans qualify as Influentials. Our study found that 69% of Online Political Citizens are Influentials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipdi.org/UploadedFiles/political%20influentials.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040407090353/http://www.ipdi.org/UploadedFiles/political%20influentials.pdf |archivedate=2004-04-07 |format=PDF |title=Political Influentials in the 2004 Presidential campaign |publisher=Institute for Politics, Democracy and the Internet, Graduate School of Political Management |date=February 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information communication technologies ==
Information communication technologies (ICTs) make communication and information readily available and efficient. There are millions of Facebook accounts, Twitter users and websites, and one can educate oneself on nearly any subject. While this is for the most part a positive thing, it can also be dangerous. For example, people can read up on the latest news events relatively easily and quickly; however, there is danger in the fact that apathy or fatigue can quickly arise when people are inundated with so many messages, or that the loudest voice on a subject can often be the most extreme one, distorting public perception on the issue.

These social networks which occupy ICTs are simply modern forms of political instruments which pre-date the technological era.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Laura|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|year=2010|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can now go to online forums or Twitter instead of town hall meetings. People can essentially mobilize worldwide through the Internet. Women can create transnational alliances and lobby for rights within their respective countries; they can give each other tips and share up-to-date information. This information becomes "hyper textual", available in downloadable formats with easy access for all.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt; The UN organizations also use "hyper textual" formats. They can post information about upcoming summits, they can post newsletters on what occurred at these meetings, and links to videos can be shared; all of this information can be downloaded at the click of a button.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt; The UN and many other actors are presenting this information in an attempt to get a certain message out in the cyber sphere and consequently steer public perception on an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=Laua|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics|year=2010|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With all this information so readily available, there is a rising trend of "slacktivism" or "clicktivism".  While it is positive that information can be distributed so quickly and efficiently all around the world, there is negativity in the fact that people often take this information for granted, or quickly forget about it once they have seen it flash across our computer screens.&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2010" /&gt;  Viral campaigns are great for sparking initial interest and conversation, but they are not as effective in the long term—people begin to think that clicking "like" on something is enough of a contribution, or that posting information about a current hot topic on their Facebook page or Twitter feed means that they have made a difference.

== Fundraising capability ==

The Internet has also made it easier for small donors to play a meaningful role in financing political campaigns. Previously, small-donor fundraising was prohibitively expensive, as costs of printing and postage ate up most of the money raised.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}} Groups like [[MoveOn.org|MoveOn]], however, have found that they can raise large amounts of money from small donors at minimal cost, with credit card transaction fees constituting their biggest expense. "For the first time, you have a door into the political process that isn't marked 'big money,' " says Darr. "That changes everything.

== Ethical Considerations ==
With [[internet]] technology vastly changing existing and introducing new mechanisms by which to attain, share and employ information, internet activism raises ethical issues for consideration. Proponents contend internet activism serves as an outlet for social progress but only if personal and professional ethics are employed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/articles_papers_reports/770|title=Ethics in Online Activism: False Senses of Social Action or Effective Source of Change?|last=Jaber|first=Rimah|date=February 22, 2016|work=Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs|access-date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of online activism claim new information and communications technologies help increase the political power of activist groups that would otherwise have less resources. Proponents along this line of thinking claim the most effective use of online activism is its use in conjunction with more traditional or historical activism activities.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Pickerill, "Rethinking political participation: Experiments in internet activism in Australia and Britain." Curtin University of Technology, July, 2002. Retrieved 2017-3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, critics worry about facts and beliefs becoming indistinct in online campaigns and about "sectors of online activism [being] more self-interested than socially interested."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These critics warn against the manipulation commonplace to online activism for private or personal interests such as exploiting charities for monetary gain, influencing voters in the political arena and inflating self-importance or effectiveness. In this sense, the ethical implication is that activism becomes descriptive rather than transformative of society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  One of these reviewers suggests seven pitfalls to beware of in internet activism: "self-promotion at the expense of the movement... unsolicited bulk [[email]]... [[Hacktivism]]... violating [[copyright]]... nagging... violating privacy... and being scary." &lt;ref&gt;Tom Head, "A Short Guide to the Ethics and Etiquette of Online Activism." Pearson, August 4, 2010. Retrieved 2017-3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ethical criticisms against the prevalence of online activism are further discussed in the criticisms section of this article.

== Criticism ==

=== Demographic issues ===
Critics argue that Internet activism faces the same challenges as other aspects of the [[digital divide]], particularly the [[global digital divide]]. Some say it gives disproportionate representation to those with greater access or technological ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shulman.ucsur.pitt.edu/doc/Papers/gendiff.pdf |title=IRMJ01mcmanus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210154058/http://shulman.ucsur.pitt.edu/doc/Papers/gendiff.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen |first=Jakob |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/digital-divide.html |title=Digital Divide: The Three Stages (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox) |publisher=Useit.com |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups that may be disadvantaged by the move to activist activity online are those that have limited access to technologies, or lack the technological literacy to engage meaningfully online; these include ethnic and racial minorities, those of lower socioeconomic status, those with lower levels of education, and the elderly.

A study looked at the impact of Social Networking Sites (SNS) on various demographics and their political activity. Not surprisingly college students used SNS for political activity the most but this was followed by a more unlikely group, those that had not completed high school. In addition the probability for non-White citizens to consume political information was shown to be higher than that of Whites. These two outcomes go in the face of normal predictors of political activity. Despite these surprising findings older generations, men and whites showed the highest levels of political mobilization. Acts of political mobilization, such as fundraising, volunteering, protesting require the most continued interest, resources and knowledge (Nam, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Nam, T. (2011). Whose e-democracy? The democratic divide in American electoral campaigns. Information Polity: The International Journal of Government &amp; Democracy in the Information Age, 16(2), 131-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Real debate? ===

&lt;blockquote&gt;The experience of the echo chamber is easier to create with a computer than with many of the forms of political interaction that preceded it," Sunstein told the ''[[New York Times]]''. "The discussion will be about strategy, or [[horse race journalism|horse-race issues]] or how bad the other candidates are, and it will seem like debate. It's not like this should be censored, but it can increase acrimony, increase extremism and make mutual understanding more difficult.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Scott Duke Harris of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' noted that "the Internet connects [all sides of issues, not just] an ideologically broad anti-war constituency, from the leftists of [[Act Now to Stop War and End Racism|ANSWER]] to the pressed-for-time '[[soccer moms]]' who might prefer [[moveon.org|MoveOn]], and conservative activists as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216042234/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archivedate=2003-02-16 |format=PDF |title=Scott Duke Harris: Anti-war Movement Marshals Forces Online |author=Scott Duke Harris |date=February 3, 2003 |quote=The Internet connects an ideologically broad anti-war constituency, from the leftists of A.N.S.W.E.R. to the pressed-for-time "soccer moms" who might prefer MoveOn, and conservative activists as well. And for its part, MoveOn is itself part of an anti-war coalition that includes the NAACP, the Sierra Club, the National Organization for Women and the National Council of Churches.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern, according to University of California professor Barbara Epstein, is that the Internet "allows people who agree with each other to talk to each other and gives them the impression of being part of a much larger network than is necessarily the case." She warns that the impersonal nature of communication by computer may actually undermine the human contact that always has been crucial to social movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030216042234/http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/5093013.htm |archivedate=2003-02-16 |format=PDF |title=Scott Duke Harris: Anti-war Movement Marshals Forces Online |author=Scott Duke Harris |date=February 3, 2003 |quote=All the Internet traffic may represent an "echo chamber" of virtual activism rather than meaningful protest, warns Barbara Epstein, a University of California-Santa Cruz professor of the history of consciousness. The Internet, she says, "allows people who agree with each other to talk to each other and gives them the impression of being part of a much larger network than is necessarily the case."  The impersonal nature of communication by computer, Epstein suggests, may have a more insidious effect, undermining important human contact that always has been crucial to social movements. During the Vietnam War, "a large sector of a generation got drawn in, in a very personal way. They went to a protest because their roommate was going. The movement became the center of social life. It became the most exciting place on campus."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern, expressed by author and law professor [[Cass Sunstein]], is that online political discussions lead to "[[cyberbalkanization]]"—discussions that lead to fragmentation and polarization rather than consensus, because the same medium that lets people access a large number of news sources also enables them to pinpoint the ones they agree with and ignore the rest.

=== Moving to offline action ===

Famed activist [[Ralph Nader]] has stated that "the Internet doesn't do a very good job of motivating action", citing that the [[United States Congress]], corporations and [[the Pentagon]] do not necessarily "fear the civic use of the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lasar |first=Matthew |url=https://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/05/ralph-nader-internet-not-so-hot-at-motivating-action.ars |title=Ralph Nader: Internet not so hot at "motivating action" |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethan Zuckerman]] talks about "[[slacktivism]]", claiming that the Internet has devalued certain currencies of activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.causebuilder.info |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124121745/http://www.causebuilder.info/ |archivedate=2012-11-24 |title=Causebuilder Resources and Information |publisher=Causebuilder.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens may "like" an activist group on [[Facebook]], visit a website, or comment on a blog, but fail to engage in political activism beyond the Internet, such as volunteering or canvassing. This critique has been criticized as Western-centric, however, because it discounts the impact this can have in authoritarian or repressive contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV2E2T9GFaE |title=Cyberactivism and the Arab Revolt: Battles Waged Online and Lessons Learned (Part 1 of 9) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Courtney C. Radsch]] argued that even this low level of engagement was an important form of activism for [[Arab]] youth because it is a form of free speech, and can spark mainstream media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bakerinstitute.org/publications/ITP-pub-CyberactivismAndWomen-051712.pdf |title=Unveiling the Revolutionaries: Cyberactivism and Women's Role in the Arab Uprisings|author=Radsch, Courtney|publisher=Rice University | date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slacktivism ===

Scholars are divided as to whether the Internet will increase or decrease political participation, including online activism. Those who suggest political participation will increase believe the Internet can be used to recruit and communicate with more users, and offers lower-costs modes of participation for those who lack the time or motivation to engage otherwise. Those concerned that the Internet will decrease activism argue that the Internet occupies free time that can no longer be spent getting involved in activist groups, or that Internet activism will replace more substantial, effortful forms of in-person activism.

=== Clicktivism ===

Another criticism is clicktivism. According to techopedia, clicktivism is a controversial form of digital activism. Proponents believe that applying advertising principles such as A/B testing increases the impact of a message by leveraging the Internet to further its reach. Opponents believe that clicktivism reduces activism to a mere mouse-click, yielding numbers with little or no real engagement or commitment to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Janssen |first=Cory |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/28184/clicktivism |title=What is Clicktivism? - Definition from |publisher=Techopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Micah M. White]] argues, "Political engagement becomes a matter of clicking a few links. In promoting the illusion that surfing the web can change the world, clicktivism is to activism as McDonalds is to a slow-cooked meal. It may look like food, but the life-giving nutrients are long gone."&lt;ref name="commondreams1"&gt;{{cite web|last=White |first=Micah |url=https://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/08/12-4 |title=Clicktivism is Ruining Leftist Activism |publisher=Common Dreams |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that political engagement becomes a matter of clicking a few links and neglects the vital, immeasurable inner-events and personal epiphanies that great social ruptures are actually made of. It reduces activism to a mere mouse click.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bath.ac.uk/hss-placements/2012/12/02/clicktivism/ |title=Humanities &amp; Social Sciences' Placements |publisher=Blogs.bath.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Micah M. White]] goes on to argue that "... clicktivism reinforces the fear of standing out from the crowd and taking a strong position. It discourages calling for drastic action. And as such, clicktivism will never breed social revolution. To think that it will is a fallacy. One that is dawning on us".&lt;ref name="commondreams1" /&gt;

=== State repression ===

In ''Net Delusion'', author Evgeny Morozov argues against cyberutopianism. He describes how the Internet is successfully used against activists and for the sake of state repression.&lt;ref&gt;Morozov, E. (2011). The Net Delusion The Dark Side of Internet Freedom. New York: Public Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism small}}
'''Kuberakolam''' (also written as Kubera kolam) is a certain [[magic square]] of order 3 constructed using [[rice flour]] and drawn on the floors of several houses in [[South India]]. In [[Hindu mythology]], [[Kubera]] is the [[god]] of riches and wealth, and it is believed that if one worships the Kubera kolam as ordained in the [[scripture]]s, he/she will be rewarded with wealth and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramesh N|title=Chant "Lord Kuber" Mantra for uniform cash flow|url=http://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/faith-and-rituals/chant-lord-kuber-mantra-for-uniform-cash-flow|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
A [[kolam]] is a drawing composed of [[Straight line|lines]] and [[Loop (topology)|loop]]s, drawn around a [[grid pattern]] of dots. In many places in South India, this form of painting is drawn using [[rice powder]] /chalk/chalk powder and colored powders.  
==The construction of Kubera kolam==
The Kubera kolam magic square is formed by the numbers 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 in the arrangement depicted below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;25&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;28&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

In this magic square, the numbers in each row, and in each column, and the numbers in the forward and backward main diagonals, all add up to the same number, namely, 72.
To construct the Kubera kolam, the lines are drawn first. The numbers are then written in the following order: 24, 28, 23, 22, 27, 20, 25, 26, 21 in that order. A coin and a flower are usually placed in each cell.

==In literature==
[[The Lost Symbol]], a 2009 novel written by American writer [[Dan Brown]], contains a brief reference to Kubera kolam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dan Brown|title=The Lost Symbol (Robert Langdon Book 3)|year=2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781409091486|page=263|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8l5ApOH2CwC&amp;dq=kubera+kolam+magic+square&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alex Carmine|title=Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol: The Ultimate Unauthorized and Independent Reading Guide|year=2009|publisher=Punked Books|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science==
Attempts have been made to use the Kubera Kolam to introduce  randomization in image steganography.

'''Losengo''' (Lusengo) is a Bantu language spoken in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It has had a significant effect on [[Lingala]], the most important Bantu language in the two Congos.

Maho (2009) lists the following dialects:&lt;ref name="Guthrie"/&gt;
* Poto (Pfoto), including Yakata
* Mpesa (Limpesa)
* Mbudza (''cf.'' the related [[Budza language]])
* Mangala (Ngala) [the name of the [[Bangi language|Bangi]] lingua franca that became [[Lingala]]]
* [[Boloki language|Loki]] (Boloki)
* Kangana
* [[Ndolo language|Ndolo]]

(Yamongeri, however, is a variety of [[Mongo language|Mongo]].)

After a career in theatre in [[New York City|New York]] and [[London]], Lorne made her first film in 1951, and for the remainder of her life played small roles in films and television. Her recurring role as [[Bewitched#Cast|Aunt Clara]] in the comedy series ''[[Bewitched]]'', between 1964 and her death in 1968, brought her widespread recognition, and for which she was  [[wikt:posthumously|posthumously]] awarded an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]].

==Early life and education==
Lorne was born in [[West Pittston, Pennsylvania|West Pittston]], Pennsylvania, a small mining town halfway between [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] and [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]. She was the daughter of William Lorne MacDougall MD, and his wife, Jane Louise (née Oliver), known as "Jennie". She was born in 1883 (although by the 1920s she had shaved five years off of her age). While her year of birth is listed as 1885 in some sources, including the date inscribed on [https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/474x/44/d6/33/44d633845d5844d8be5d466d22a002c1.jpg her urn] (which appears to be erroneous), it was usually listed as 1888 when she was alive. The [[1900 United States Census]] (enumerated in June 1900) gives her age as 16 &lt;ref name="1900census"&gt;[http://interactive.ancestrylibrary.com/7602/004115126_00311/47073668?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestrylibrary.com%2f%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3fdb%3d1900usfedcen%26h%3d47073668%26ti%3d5542%26indiv%3dtry%26gss%3dpt%26ssrc%3dpt_t71600495_p40244247078_kpidz0q3d40244247078z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid&amp;ssrc=pt_t71600495_p40244247078_kpidz0q3d40244247078z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid&amp;backlabel=ReturnRecord 1900 census record for Marion Lorne MacDougall, although her middle initial appears as "M", not "L"], ancestry.com; accessed September 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and, along with the [[Social Security Death Index]] (SSDI), lists her year of birth as 1883. Her parents were [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[English people|English]] immigrants. She had a younger brother, Lorne Taylor MacDougall (October 20, 1893 – September 5, 1943).&lt;ref name="TV Guide 1968"&gt;''The Magic of Marion Lorne''. TV Guide, March 23–29, 1968, pp 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="TV Guide 1968"/&gt;

==Career==
Lorne debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1905; she also acted in London theaters, enjoying a flourishing stage career on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In London she had her own theater, the Whitehall, where she had top billing in plays written by [[Walter C. Hackett]], her husband.&lt;ref name="TV Guide 1968"/&gt; None of her productions at the Whitehall had runs shorter than 125 nights.&lt;ref name="TV Guide 1968"/&gt;

After appearing in a couple of [[Vitaphone]] shorts, including ''Success'' (1931) starring [[Jack Haley]], she made her feature film debut in her late 60s in ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951), directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. From 1952-55, she was seen as perpetually confused junior high school English teacher Mrs. Gurney on ''[[Mister Peepers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Information Booth|journal=Radio-TV Mirror|date=December 1953|volume=41|issue=1|page=12|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Radio-Mirror/53/Mirror-1953-Dec.pdf|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1957-58, she co-starred with [[Joan Caulfield]] in the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Sally (1957 TV series)|Sally]]'' in the role of an elderly widow who happens to be the co-owner of a [[department store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Comedy/Sally.htm|title=Sally (1957 TV series)|publisher=Classic TV Archives|accessdate=September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although afraid of live television, declaring "I'm a coward when it comes to a live [television] show",&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', September 26, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; she was persuaded to appear a few times to promote the film ''[[The Girl Rush]]'' with [[Rosalind Russell]] in the mid-1950s. Between 1958 and 1964, she made regular appearances on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' (1958–1962).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Her last role, as Aunt Clara in ''[[Bewitched]]'', brought Lorne her widest fame as a lovable witch who is losing her powers due to old age (and whose spells usually end in disaster). Aunt Clara usually visited by coming down the chimney; her hobby was collecting doorknobs, and she often brought her collection with her on visits. Lorne had an extensive collection of doorknobs in real life, some of which she used as props in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aunt Clara's Doorknob Collection|url=http://fershur.com/80s-toys/nick-at-night-flashback-aunt-claras-doorknob-collection|publisher= Nick at Night Flashback|date=September 23, 2008|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She appeared in 27 episodes of ''Bewitched'' and was not replaced after she died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in her [[Manhattan]] apartment on May 9, 1968, aged 84, prior to the start of production of the show's fifth season.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart Attack is Fatal to Marion Lorne|publisher=Gettysburg Times|date=May 13, 1968|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oDUmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cf4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=904%2C4455100|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried at [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]], New York.&lt;ref name="findagrave"&gt;{{Find a Grave|grid=4048|name=Marion Lorne|accessdate=October 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posthumous===
The producers of ''Bewitched'' decided that Lorne's character as Aunt Clara could not be replicated by another actress. Comedic actress [[Alice Ghostley]] was recruited to fill the gap as "Esmeralda", a different type of older witch with wobbly magic whose spells often went astray. Coincidentally, Lorne and Ghostley had appeared side-by-side as partygoers in the iconic comedy-drama film ''[[The Graduate]]'', made the year before Lorne's death.&lt;ref name="graduate"&gt;{{cite web|title=When Esmeralda Sneezed|publisher=harpiesbizarre|date=October 1, 2007|url=http://www.harpiesbizarre.com/Esmeralda.htm|accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a posthumous [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series]] for her work on ''Bewitched''. The statue was accepted by ''Bewitched'' star [[Elizabeth Montgomery]].

==Personal life==
In 1911, she married playwright Walter C. Hackett. They were married until his death in 1944. The couple had no children.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The '''Mexican Red Cross''' is a non-governmental humanitarian assistance organization affiliated with the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] to help those in dangerous situations, such as natural disasters, as well as providing human health services. The organization finances its aid, assistance, and education programs through the work of thousands of volunteers and donation from individuals, institutions, organizations, associations and companies.&lt;ref name =gobierno&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetaj.cruzrojamexicana.org.mx/pagnacional/secciones/Juventud/Contenido/PlanetaJ/brinda_tu_auxilio.htm |title=¿Es Cruz Roja del gobierno?|first=Planeta Juventud Cruz Roja Mexicana  |accessdate=24 April 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Is the Red Cross part of the government?}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originated with a presidential decree in 1910 and was recognized internationally in 1912. Today it participates in national and international aid and disaster relief missions as well as various health services, training in first aid and for emergency medical technicians. Early in its history, it developed a program in nursing, which eventually became the Escuela Nacional de Enfermería y Obstetricia (National School of Nursing and Obstectrics), today part of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]].

==History==
The organization's history began in 1898, when the [[Spanish Red Cross]] inquired to the government of Mexico about the creation of public institutions to cooperate with military medical units. In 1907, President [[Porfirio Díaz]] signed a decree to have Mexico adhere to the [[First Geneva Convention|Geneva Convention of 1864]], especially to improve the care of the wounded and sick on battlefields. Two years later, the first provisional board of the Mexican Red Cross was established, which assisted in the floods in the city of [[Monterrey]] in 1909. The country's first brigade carrying Red Cross insignia left Mexico City for the stricken Monterrey and their efforts were recognized by the Mexican federal government.&lt;ref name =oficial&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cruzrojamexicana.org.mx/?page_id=24|title=Historia|first=Cruz Roja Mexicana  |accessdate=24 April 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=History }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of this first effort led to a 1910 presidential decree that provided official recognition to the Mexican Red Cross, allowing for the first official board to be created that same year. In 1912, the organization received international recognition through the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC). The first national convention was held in 1940 and in 1950, the Mexican Red Cross and the [[Secretariat of National Defense (Mexico)|Ministry of Defense]] signed an agreement establishing their relations during peacetime. In 1968, Mexican Red Cross's main hospital opened in the [[Polanco, Mexico City|Polanco neighborhood of Mexico City]].&lt;ref name =ILCE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/efemerides/febrero/conme21.htm|title=Fundación de la Cruz Roja Mexicana |first=ILCE |date=14 April 2005 |accessdate=24 April 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Foundation of the Mexican Red Cross }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uniform, logo and activities==
Members and volunteers with the Mexican Red Cross are authorized to wear Red Cross insignia. The Mexican version is nine cm by seven cm badge with a white background. It has a red cross consisting of five equal squares. Underneath the words "Cruz Roja Mexicana" appear in [[Arial]] bold black. Indications of specific sectors and programs appear on the outer edge and a lower band with specific sizes. Identification cards have a color coding system which indicate the types of services the affiliate provides. White is for those in administration, red for volunteers, light blue for medical services, dark blue for other care services, dark green for training and orange for other types of services.&lt;ref name=uniform&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cruzrojamexicanasonora.org.mx/descargas/reglamento-nacional-uniformes.pdf |title=Reglamento Nacional de Uniformes e insignias |first=Cruz Roja Mexicana |date=30 October 2005 |accessdate=24 April 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=National Regulation Uniforms and logos |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221011/http://www.cruzrojamexicanasonora.org.mx/descargas/reglamento-nacional-uniformes.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities of the Mexican Red Cross==
The activities of the Mexican Red Cross can be divided into three different sections: volunteer and other worker processing, integration/participation, and assistance/development. The first is designed to generate and update the volunteer databases, integrate the records of the database, provide information regarding the registration process, and credential and update current partners. The integration and participation section consists of plans, projects, general activities of the National Society, specific operational and administrative activities of the areas, committees, commissions, internal or external activities exclusive to volunteer area, and programs derived from the requests of collaboration with similar organizations through institutional agreements. The last section is in charge of the volunteering management instruction, monitoring of the institutional awards system, and following the provisions of the National Ethics Committee relating to sanctions.&lt;ref name=actividades&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cruzrojamexicana.org.mx/?page_id=104 |title=Actividades de los programas |publisher=Mexican Red Cross |location=Mexico |accessdate= May 10, 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Program activities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican Red Cross annually offers training for emergency medical technicians. Course requirements include being over age 18, in good health and fitness, high school diploma, attitude of service, discipling and passing the physical, psychological and skills exams.&lt;ref name =planet-a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetaj.cruzrojamexicana.org.mx/pagnacional/secciones/Juventud/Contenido/PlanetaJ/Somos/STCR_PresentacionPermanente.pdf|title= Somos todos cruz roja|first=Planeta Juventud Cruz Roja Mexicana |accessdate=24 April 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=We all are red cross }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the School of Nursing ==
Training in medical specialties began with the organization as early as 1910, with short courses in first aid. Soon after, they began offering nursing courses as well at two hospitals in Mexico City. In 1925, these courses were adapted to the requirements of the Secretariat of Public Education to organize the Escuela Clínica de Enfermeras de la Cruz Roja Mexicana (Clinic School of Nurses of the Mexican Red Cross).The first graduate was C. Bertha Herver Ritler, which went on to receive a scholarship to go to London and take an instructors course. In 1936, this school is integrated into the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], making it the first of its kind in Mexico at the university level. It remained an integral part of the university until 1998, when the university established the [[Escuela Nacional de Enfermería y Obstetrica]] (National School of Nursing and Obstetrics) with is semi autonomous from the main university system.&lt;ref name=enfermería&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cruzrojadf.org.mx/escuela-de-enfermeria/ |title=Antecedentes históricos de la Escuela de Enfermería |first=Cruz Roja Mexicana |accessdate=24 April 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=History of the School of Nursing |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111065439/http://www.cruzrojadf.org.mx/escuela-de-enfermeria/ |archivedate=11 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International and national aid missions==
Over the years the Mexican Red Cross has participated in a number of high-profile efforts related to disasters and public health. One of the first was the participation of the Red Cross hospital to treat victims of the [[Tlatelolco massacre|1968 student uprising]]. In the 1980s, the organization provided organized relief for the waves of refugees from [[Guatemala]] in [[Chiapas]] and other parts of the south of Mexico. It has also participated in relief efforts after various hurricanes hit Mexico in various places.&lt;ref name =oficial/&gt;

One major event for the organization was the aftermath of the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]]. Shortly after the event, rescue brigades appeared but the scale of the damage and death was more than they could handle. Not only were there too few, many were under-equipped lacking spikes, sledgehammers, machinery and special equipment. There were also shortages of medicines and blood for medical facilities. Four days after the disaster, on September 23, patients confined to bed, from the Red Cross Polanco, were rearranged in rooms that were decorated with flowers, stuffed animals and even television in order to distract them from the tragic incident.&lt;ref name =cires&gt;{{cite web |url=,http://www.cires.org.mx/1985_es.php|title= EL SISMO DEL 19 DE SEPTIEMBRE DE 1985|accessdate=24 April 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=THE EARTHQUAKE OF 19 SEPTEMBER 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent effort is the collaboration of the Mexican Red Cross with the [[National Crusade Against Hunger (Mexico)|National Crusade Against Hunger]], sponsored by the Mexican federal government. Red Cross participation includes educational programs and the raising of resources. Educational programs include those for mothers caring for infants and those for hospital patients. This also includes workshops on [[Urban agriculture|urban gardens]] and those to teach children about healthy eating habits. The Red Cross mans collection centers for money and supplies and works to distribute these resources in 120 municipalities.&lt;ref name = "diario visión"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eldiariovision.com.mx/noticia/nota,19662/#.UXbEsJVydwc|title= Colaborará la Cruz Roja Mexicana en la Cruzada Nacional Contra el Hambre |first= Diario Visión de Michoacán |date=12 April 2013 |accessdate=24 April 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican Red Cross support the National Crusade Against Hunger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from solely providing aid to people in their nation, the Mexican Red Cross has helped victims of natural or social disasters in other countries. One of these is their participation in relief efforts after [[Hurricane Katrina disaster relief|Hurricane Katrina]], sending food and other supplies.&lt;ref name =lacronica&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/notas/2005/201071.html|title= Empacan ayuda para damnificados de EU en la Cruz Roja Mexicana |first=La crónica |date=7 September 2005 |accessdate=24 April 2013 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Packed U.S. Disaster Relief in the Mexican Red Cross }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''murder of Karel Van Noppen''' was a high-profile assassination of a government livestock inspector in [[Belgium]] in 1995. Van Noppen had been investigating illegal practices by farmers and businessmen in Belgium and was shot dead by assailants outside his house in the village of [[Wechelderzande]] in the [[Antwerp (province)|Province of Antwerp]]. A number of people connected with the illegal supply of [[growth hormones]] to livestock were sentenced in connection with the murder.

=="Hormone Mafia"==
The use of [[growth hormones]] on livestock has the potential to increase the profit per animal between ten and 100 percent. However, the use of such hormones has been banned by the [[European Union]] since 1989 and so organised crime, motivated by the immense profits, moved into the business. This was a particular concern in Belgium, where several government inspectors had been threatened or had attempts made on their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/why-the-mafia-is-into-your-beef-1342852.html|title=The Independent - Why the mafia is into your beef|work=The Independent|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
In February 1995, 43-year-old Karel Van Noppen, who had been investigating the phenomenon, was shot dead outside his front door. The killing provoked outrage throughout Belgium, with a torchlight procession led by his widow in Flanders and calls to investigate and better regulate the cattle industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/belgians-march-in-memory-of-hormone-mafia-victim-1319918.html|title=The Independent -  Belgians march in memory of 'hormone mafia' victim|work=The Independent|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a court sentenced Albert Barrez, Carl de Schutter and Germain Daenen to 25 years each for their roles in the murder, while another man, Alex Vercauteren received a life sentence without parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2027719.stm|title=BBC News - Belgian hormone killers jailed|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 2011 Belgian crime drama ''[[Bullhead (film)|Bullhead]]'', directed by [[Michaël R. Roskam]], is loosely based on the incident and the hormone mafia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17041056|title=BBC News - Bullhead: Oscar contender rooted in real Belgian murder|work=BBC News|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nukapu Expedition''' occurred between October 1871 and February 1872 and was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[punitive expedition|punitive operation]] in response to the murder of [[Bishop]] [[John Coleridge Patteson]] by the natives of [[Nukapu]]. A [[Royal Navy]] warship was sent to the island and it sank a group of hostile [[canoe|war-canoes]] and landed men to attack a fortified village.

==Expedition==
In October 1871, the screw [[sloop-of-war]] [[HMS Rosario (1860)|HMS ''Rosario'']] was operating against [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]] [[blackbirder]]s when her captain, [[Commander|Acting-Commander]] [[Albert Hastings Markham]] received orders to sail for Nukapu in the [[Solomon Islands]]. A contemporary newspaper described the events thus:
{{cquote|''The Rosario{{'}}s boat had got to within 50 yards of the mainland when the natives commenced their war dance and made other hostile indications. They then sent a shower of arrows at the Rosario{{'}}s boat, which however, all fell short. The boat then returned to the ship to report the attack, and to ask permission to return it. The boat was ordered to return, and the ship was cleared for action, and opened fire with shell from the [[RBL 40 pounder Armstrong gun|40-pounder Armstrong]], and the [[RML 7 inch gun|7in. six and a half ton gun]]; while the crew of the boat opened fire with their rifles. The Rosario made a circuit of the island, and when abreast of the native village fired on it with shell at 2,300 yards. At 4 p.m., it being high water, the boats were able to cross the reef, and four of them advanced on the village with small arms, and engaged the natives, who kept up a continual discharge of arrows; the ship sent in shell at a range of a mile. After firing several hundred rounds, the men landed from the boats and drove the natives in from the beach. Here one of the arrows struck Corporal Marcus in the arm, and the wound afterwards proved fatal. The native canoes were destroyed, and the seamen pulled on to the village, where one of them received two bad wounds, but ultimately recovered from their effects. The village proved to be very strongly fortified with stonework, which was thrown up in front of each hut. In a few minutes the native habitations were set in flames. It was estimated that from 20 to 30 natives were killed in the engagement.|20px|20px|The ''Rosario'' and the Murderers of Bishop Patteson, reported in ''The Argus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The ''Rosario'' and the Murderers of Bishop Patteson|newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]]| location = [[Melbourne]] |date= 15 February 1872|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5859743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, pg. 32-323&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Markham published an account of the cruise under the title ''The cruise of the ''Rosario'' amongst the New Hebrides and Santa Cruz Islands, exposing the recent atrocities connected with the kidnapping of natives in the South Seas.''&lt;ref name=CR&gt;{{cite book |title=The cruise of the ''Rosario'' amongst the New Hebrides and Santa Cruz Islands |last=Markham |first=Albert Hastings |authorlink=Albert Hastings Markham  |year=1873 |publisher=Sampson Low, Marston, Low, and Searle |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measures taken by ''Rosario'' became the subject of questions in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1872/mar/11/question-5#S3V0209P0_18720311_HOC_34|title=Hansard, 11 March 1872|accessdate=2009-11-19|quote=Mr W Johnston asked the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, If there is any foundation for the statement that Her Majesty's ship ''Rosario'' has shelled and destroyed the village in the Island of Nukapu, in which resided the natives who murdered Bishop Patteson; and, if so, by whose orders this was done?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Markham's book&lt;ref name=CR/&gt; on the subject may well have been prompted by them. The book itself makes clear that Markham clearly understood the cycle of violence and deplored both the murderous activities of the Blackbirders, and the apparent need for further violence in restoring order.&lt;ref name=CR/&gt;

'''Occupy the SEC''' (OSEC) is an [[Activism|activist group]] which aims to influence financial regulators to work for the [[public interest]]. The "SEC" in its name refers to the US [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], but OSEC's scope covers all [[Financial regulation|financial regulatory]] activity. OSEC was formed and developed as an outgrowth and working group of [[Occupy Wall Street]].&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

Among its members are employees or former employees of some of the largest [[Financial institution|financial firm]]s.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/occupy-the-regulatory-system/2012/04/27/gIQAjo21lT_blog.html | title=Occupy the regulatory system! | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=April 27, 2012 | accessdate=12 April 2014 | author=Khimm, Suzy}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been described as "a counterweight to the deep-pocket lobbying push" by financial firms against reform.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt;

== History ==
OSEC was founded in October 2011 as a working group of [[Occupy Wall Street]],&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt; the protest movement which started in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan on September 17, 2011. After initially meeting on a bench in Zuccotti Park, late October 2011,&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt; the group evolved into a bi-weekly "book club" at a diner near the park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/finance/occupy-the-sec-weighs-in-on-the-volcker-rule-02142012.html | title=Occupy the SEC Weighs In on the Volcker Rule | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] | date=February 14, 2012 | accessdate=12 April 2014 | author=Weise, Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then met weekly in the atrium of 60 Wall Street.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-03-01/occupy-the-sec-writes-new-volcker-rule-script-commentary-by-susan-antilla | title=Occupy Vigilantes Write New Volcker Rule Script: Susan Antilla | publisher=Bloomberg | date=February 29, 2012 | accessdate=12 April 2014 | author=Antilla, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group first gained attention after tackling a response to the proposed [[Volcker Rule]], part of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank Act of 2010]], that would severely limit proprietary trading at commercial banks, similar to the [[Glass–Steagall Act|Glass Steagall Act of 1933]]. OSEC drafted answers to questions regarding the proposed rule, which were included in a 325-page comment letter submitted to the SEC on February 13, 2012.&lt;ref name="Salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scribd"/&gt;

== Volcker Rule comment letter and follow-up ==
Submitted by OSEC to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] on February 13, 2012, the 325-page comment letter&lt;ref name="Scribd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RytnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT91 | title=Republic of Outsiders: The Power of Amateurs, Dreamers and Rebels | publisher=The New Press | author=Quart, Alissa | year=2013 | pages=(unlisted) | isbn=1595588949}}&lt;/ref&gt; was hailed as "amazing", describing how the authors went through the rule "line by line, explaining where it's useless and where it can and should be improved."&lt;ref name="Salmon"/&gt; Others suggested OSEC was doing "the day-in, day-out grind of policymaking—calling legislators, responding to regulatory agencies, learning the issues..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/02/14/occupy_the_sec_releases_325_page_comment_letter_on_quot_volcker_rule_quot_proposals.html |date=February 14, 2012 |title=Occupy the SEC Releases 325-Page Comment Letter on "Volcker Rule" Proposals |first=Matthew |last=Yglesias |publisher=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSEC's comment letter was close to the lengthiest and most detailed of the 16,000 letters sent to the SEC,&lt;ref name="bloomberg" /&gt; with the vast majority coming from industry insiders. This letter was cited 284 times by the Federal Reserve Board when the regulations were ultimately put into effect in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/12/11/the-volcker-rule-cites-the-occupy-movement-284-times/ |title=The Volcker rule cites the Occupy Movement 284 times |first=Lydia |last=DePillis |publisher=Washington Post |date=December 11, 2013 | accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 26, 2013, OSEC filed a suit in the Eastern District Court of New York naming the Federal Reserve, the SEC, CFTC, OCC, FDIC, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury calling for implementation of the "[[Volcker Rule]]" (Section 619 of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank Act of 2010)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://occupythesec.nycga.net/2013/02/27/occupy-the-sec-sues-federal-reserve-sec-cftc-occ-fdic-and-u-s-treasury-over-volcker-rule-delays/ | title=Occupy the SEC Sues Federal Reserve, SEC, CFTC, OCC, FDIC and U.S. Treasury Over Volcker Rule Delays | publisher=Occupy the SEC blog | date=February 27, 2013 | accessdate=12 April 2014 | author=Occupy the SEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ongoing activities ==
After the Volcker Rule comment letter, the group continued to engage in regulatory matters where it felt that the 99% needed to be represented.

In June 2012, Occupy the SEC submitted a 7-page letter to the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate Banking Committee]] prior to JP Morgan CEO [[Jamie Dimon]]'s testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/12/occupy-the-sec-jamie-dimon_n_1591465.html | title='Occupy The SEC' Has Exactly 11 Questions For Jamie Dimon | publisher=[[Huffington Post]] | date=June 12, 2012 | accessdate=12 April 2014 | first=Jillian | last=Berman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, OSEC submitted an [[amicus curiae|amicus brief]] in the case of Gabelli v. SEC, in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] will decide when the statute of limitations clock begins for certain [[fraud]] actions brought by the government – from the time the fraud was last committed or from the time the fraud was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs-v2/11-1274_resp_amcu_ots.authcheckdam.pdf | title=Brief of Occupy the SEC as ''Amicus Curiae'' in Support of Respondent | publisher=[[American Bar Association]] | accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2013, OSEC submitted a formal comment letter on money market fund reform to the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council| Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)]]. The letter urged FSOC to move forward with money market reforms, supported the proposals for floating NAVs and buffers to absorb losses but pointed out that broader reforms were required as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FSOC-2012-0003-0128 | title=OSEC Comment to FSOC on MMFs | date=15 February 2013 | accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was cited several times by the SEC when they promulgated reforms to market fund regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=SEC-2014-1371-0001 | title=SEC MMF Reform Rule | date=14 October 2014 | accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, OSEC submitted an [[amicus curiae|amicus brief]] to the US Supreme Court regarding overly broad interpretations of securities litigation laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs-v2/12-79-12-86-12-88_resp_amcu_oc-sec.pdf | title=OSEC Troice Amicus | date=29 July 2013 | accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, OSEC submitted an [[amicus curiae|amicus brief]] to the US Supreme Court in the case of Omnicare v. Laborers Pension Fund supporting the rights to sue securities issuers and their agents for material misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/BriefsV4/13-435_resp_amcu_otsec.pdf | title=OSEC Omnicare v Laborers Amicus | date=28 August 2014 | accessdate=2015-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, OSEC filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in Bank of America N.A. v. Caulkett, and Bank of America N.A. v. Toledo-Cardona. OSEC also filed comment letters relating to the systemic risks created or propagated by asset managers to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and in May a letter on designation of asset managers as [[SIFI | SIFIs (Systemically Important Financial Institutions)]] to the global [[Financial Stability Board| Financial Stability Board (FSB)]].

In November 2015, the group submitted a comment letter to the CFTC on aggregate position limits. They also organized an effort to petition Congress to oppose a bill backed by the Koch brothers. It generated over 1,000 letters.

== Reception ==
According to ''The Economist'', Occupy the SEC's "contributions to the debate on [[regulatory reform]] (including a tome on the Volcker Rule) have been well-received even by some leading regulators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/21563341 | title=Occupy Wall Street: Afterthoughts | publisher=''[[The Economist]]'' | date=September 22, 2012 | accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pornified: How Pornography Is Damaging Our Lives, Our Relationships, and Our Families''''' is a 2005 book by American writer [[Pamela Paul]], discussing the impact of ready access to [[pornography]] on Americans.

The book was selected as one of the best books of 2005 by ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' and was a ''New York Times Book Review'' Editor's Choice. Social conservatives such as [[Albert Mohler]], President of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], endorsed the book enthusiastically,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crosswalk.com/1346936/ Pornified America--The Culture of Pornography]&lt;/ref&gt; though he predicted it might "find a chilly reception in a society increasingly given over to the [[sexual arousal|titillation]], perversion, and profits offered by pornography".

The ''Washington Post Book World'' characterized the book as "A persuasive argument that today's pornography is not the [[Playboy]] centerfold or the Deep Throat of yesteryear...Paul's remedy charts a sensible middle ground between restraints and free speech." Sex columnist [[Amy Sohn]], on the other hand, cared less for the book and argued in the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' that "Paul never gives credence to the many women who enjoy consuming porn, alone or with partners".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/books/review/11sohn.html "Pornified - Dirty Minds," Amy Sohn, ''New York Times Book Review,'' September 11, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-graduate service''' (or, post-graduate [[volunteering]]) is a range of commitments that people who have recently graduated with a [[college degree]] can make to volunteer in a community in need.  Discussed within the setting of colleges and universities, post-graduate service is seen as an alternative to entering the [[workforce]] or going to a graduate or professional school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grinnell.edu/offices/socialcommitment/postgradopps Post-Graduation Service Opportunities - Social Commitment | Grinnell College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613040013/http://www.grinnell.edu/offices/socialcommitment/postgradopps |date=2011-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A post-graduate volunteer works for a [[non-profit organization]] on a full-time and long-term basis.  Non-profits can have internal programs for taking on such volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcloudschool.org/volunteers/volunteers.htm VOLUNTEER PROGRAM :: Red Cloud Indian School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215105422/http://www.redcloudschool.org/volunteers/volunteers.htm |date=2011-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But what is more commonly meant by "post-graduate service" is when graduates interested in service of this kind become applicants to broader programs that have relationships with multiple (in the case of [[AmeriCorps]], ''thousands'' of) non-profits.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://socialconcerns.nd.edu/postgraduate/about_service.shtml About Post-Graduate Service: Center for Social Concerns&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720011922/http://socialconcerns.nd.edu/postgraduate/about_service.shtml |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These programs, upon accepting the graduate, "place" him or her with a non-profit.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.villanova.edu/campusministry/events/volunteerfair/ Post Graduate Volunteer Service Fair&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The placement can resemble paid employment and usually demands a commitment of one (or two) year(s).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.spc.edu/pages/2490.asp Post-Graduate Volunteer Opportunities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129235943/http://spc.edu/pages/2490.asp |date=2010-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lmu.edu/studentlife/csa/postgraduate.htm Post-graduate Service Opportunities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130010326/http://www.lmu.edu/studentlife/csa/postgraduate.htm |date=2011-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

In wider circles, the terms “service” and “volunteering” tend to be invoked when the person is unpaid.  Thus, here they are used somewhat differently, as many who engage in post-graduate service are given [[stipend]]s or are compensated.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/offices/careers/jobs/volunteer/volunteerlistings.html Volunteer Opportunities Listings - Boston College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320104754/http://www.bc.edu/offices/careers/jobs/volunteer/volunteerlistings.html |date=2011-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are programs that care to address this—by referring to their participants as “members” and not “volunteers.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityyear.org/whowelookfor.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222205559/http://www.cityyear.org/whowelookfor.aspx |archivedate=2011-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also some programs designed for recently graduated students, such as [[Teach For America]], that have certain similarities to post-graduate service but offer members more than mere compensation but full salaries and thus are not generally considered post-graduate service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachforamerica.org/the-corps-experience/compensation/ Compensation - Teach For America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with post-graduate service being an [[umbrella term]] that has meaning insofar as university students and staff members use it and find it helpful, these exclusions and exceptions are not highly significant.

==Variations in post-graduate service==

The organizations that fit this umbrella term—i.e., that take on post-graduate volunteers, either for their own use or to place with separate non-profits—differ in several important ways.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialconcerns.nd.edu/postgraduate/pg_opportunities.shtml Post-graduate Opportunities: Center for Social Concerns&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental character===
The [[United States federal government]] has launched its own programs aimed at putting volunteers in places within the country or in the world that have been identified as needful of such service. The [[Corporation for National and Community Service]] was established in 1993, and while it takes volunteers of all ages across multiple programs, its AmeriCorps program is an option that many recent college graduates choose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalservice.gov/about/role_impact/history.asp NationalService.gov &gt; Our History and Legislation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, the [[Peace Corps]] has been in existence since 1961, placing volunteers in (among other contexts) third-world poverty, that they might be partner to local communities efforts at self-improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=about.history History | About Us | Peace Corps&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122114805/http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=about.history |date=2011-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With these programs understood to be “governmental post-graduate service”, most of the rest of what is considered post-graduate service is non-governmental.

===Location===
Some organizations put volunteers in domestic service, others in international service (here “domestic” refers to the United States of America).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  In addition to the Peace Corps, examples of international post-graduate service programs would be Jesuit Volunteer Corps International and Good Shepherd Volunteers International.  Domestic programs include [[City Year]] and Loretto Volunteers.  Parallelistically, non-profit organizations that have their own programs for taking on full-time volunteers ''which are domestic'' include Nazareth Farm and Amate House.  Non-profits that have their own programs for taking on full-time volunteers ''which are international'' include Farm of the Child and Working Boys’ Center.

===Religious character===
Organizations can differ in their religious character.  Some programs are entirely [[secular]] (or, non-faith-based) and some are faith-based, including being affiliated with [[religion]]s, [[Religious denomination|denominations]], or [[religious institute]]s.  Many organizations that would be called post-graduate service programs are in fact the lay missioner/volunteer arm of a particular religious institute or [[society of apostolic life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mklaymissioners.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=24 Maryknoll Lay Missioners - Who We Are&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes some programs already named, as well as the Augustinian Volunteers, [http://www.gsvolunteers.org Good Shepherd Volunteers], Dominican Volunteers, [[Maryknoll Lay Missioners]], Cabrini Mission Corps (Cabrini Sisters), and Little Sisters of the Assumption Family in Mission (Little Sisters of the Assumption).

===Housing===
A post-graduate volunteer’s [[house|housing]] and living situation varies greatly across programs.  Some volunteer residences would qualify as [[intentional community]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  In such cases, volunteers may not be expected to contribute to housing costs, as when the house belongs to or is paid for by the post-graduate service program.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  In other cases, volunteers are expected to procure their own housing.&lt;ref&gt;AmeriCorps VISTA Handbook, Ch. 13, {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalservice.gov/help/vistahandbook/chapter13.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714022147/http://www.nationalservice.gov/help/vistahandbook/chapter13.html |archivedate=2010-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programs' values and philosophies===
Some differences lie in program philosophies.  Many organizations that place or take volunteers have distinct approaches to service, often integrating their understandings of service with [[values]] or “pillars” that present their vision of how a volunteer (or a person generally) should live.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.canisius.edu/camp_minist/volunteer_service.asp Canisius College - Post Graduate Service Year&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, the [[Jesuit Volunteer Corps]] identifies its “values” as [[social justice]], [[community]], [[spirituality]], and [[simple living]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jesuitvolunteers.org/default.cfm/PID=1.25.10 Jesuit Volunteers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  An integrated approach to service means living out these values and includes specific actions for the volunteers that speak to them and build on them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Post-graduate service on college campuses==

Colleges and universities in the United States can occasionally be found to have structures in place, or particular staff members, who—like [[career development]] departments—aid interested students in their search for the right service program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/mission/mission_and_ministry/dorothy_day_center_f/current_students/post_graduate_opport_71218.asp Post-Graduate Volunteer Opportunities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Catholic Volunteer Network (formerly called the Catholic Network of Volunteer Service) is made up of 200 member organizations that take post-graduate volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicvolunteernetwork.org/aboutus/index.php Catholic Volunteer Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725145107/https://www.catholicvolunteernetwork.org/aboutus/index.php |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these organizations report to CVN the colleges and universities from which their volunteers come, such that CVN can publicize which colleges are sending the most students into volunteering positions within their network.  In previous rank orderings, the [[University of Notre Dame]] has topped CVN’s list.&lt;ref&gt;Faith Works (newsletter of the Catholic Network of Volunteer Service), Winter 2007, {{cite web |url=http://www.cnvs.org/docs_PDF/faithworks/fw_2007_Winter.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725184407/http://www.cnvs.org/docs_PDF/faithworks/fw_2007_Winter.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-graduate service and future graduate studies==

Post-graduate service is chosen by a person when she or he has just acquired a degree and, because it is a full-time commitment, thus precludes immediate entrance to a more advanced [[degree program]].  For this reason, many do post-graduate service with an interest in going to graduate school upon their return.  To this point, CNVS membership surveys from 2001-2006 reported that a third of all returning full-time volunteers followed their period of service with graduate-level studies &lt;ref&gt;"Post-graduate Service' PowerPoint Presentation" by CNVS task force, {{cite web |url=http://socialconcerns.nd.edu/postgraduate/documents/NDPGSpresentation.ppt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720011927/http://socialconcerns.nd.edu/postgraduate/documents/NDPGSpresentation.ppt |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach acts on the hope that the experience of long-term service—particularly experience in building relationships with the poor (should that be present)—makes one a more visibly mature, independent, and determined applicant.

'''Sara Jane Olson''' (born '''Kathleen Ann Soliah''' on January 16, 1947) was a member of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA) in the 1970s. She grew up in [[Palmdale, California]], the daughter of [[Norwegian-American]] parents,&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news |title=June 27, 1999: The life and times of Sara Jane Olson |author=Chuck Haga |date=March 21, 2008 |url=http://www.startribune.com/printarticle/?id=16894551 |work=Star Tribune |location=Minneapolis |accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seattle&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000110&amp;slug=A20000112010329 | work=The Seattle Times | title=A Radical Change? | date=January 10, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsie Soliah (née Engstrom)&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; and [[Palmdale High School]] English teacher&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; and coach Martin Soliah.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/OLSON+STUNS+COURTROOM+SLA+FUGITIVE+PLEADS+GUILTY,+BUT+LATER+SAYS+...-a079647796|title=Olson Stuns Courtroom SLA Fugitive Pleads Guilty, but Later Says She's Not |publisher=thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went into hiding in 1976 after having been indicted in a bombing case. She has lived much of her life in [[Minnesota]] under the alias Sara Jane Olson, which is now her legal name. Arrested in 1999, she pleaded guilty in 2001 to two counts of possessing explosives with intent to murder, and in 2003 to second-degree murder, both stemming from her SLA activities in the 1970s. She received a sentence of 14 years in prison.

She was mistakenly released for five days in March 2008, due to an error made in calculating her parole, before being rearrested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/22/olson.custody/index.html "70's radical-turned-housewife back in prison"], CNN, March 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; She was finally released on parole on March 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/sns-ap-sla-olson,0,5802667.story "Former 1970s radical freed from Calif. prison, to be paroled home in Minnesota"], ''The Baltimore Sun'', AP, March 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbionese Liberation Army==
Kathleen Soliah was born in [[Fargo, North Dakota]], while her family were living in [[Barnesville, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; When she was eight, her conservative [[Lutheran]]&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt; family relocated to Southern California. After graduating from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], Soliah moved to [[Berkeley, California]], with her boyfriend, [[James Kilgore]]. There, she met [[Angela Atwood]] at an acting audition where they both won lead roles. They became inseparable during the play's run. Atwood tried to sponsor Soliah into the SLA. Regardless, Soliah and Kilgore, along with her brother Steve and sister Josephine, followed the SLA closely without joining.&lt;ref name="LAWeekly"&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/12254 "The Last Revolutionary: Sara Jane Olson Speaks"] by Greg Goldin, ''LA Weekly'', January 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

When Atwood and other core members of the SLA were killed in 1974 during a standoff with police near [[Watts, Los Angeles]], following their murder of the Oakland school superintendent,&lt;ref name="MPR1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/199908/03_zdechlikm_soliah/ |title=The Case Against Kathleen Soliah |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio |date=August 3, 1999 |accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Soliahs organized memorial rallies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/tanias-world-the-inside-story-part-two-people-in-need-19751120|title=Tania's World: The Inside Story, Part Two: People in Need|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a rally in Berkeley's Willard Park (called [[Ho Chi Minh]] park by activists) where Soliah spoke in support of her friend Atwood, while being covertly filmed by the [[FBI]].&lt;ref name="MSNBC timeline"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23743392/ "Soliah-Olson timeline: Radical, bank robber, mom, inmate"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StarTribune"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/16894551.html |title=June 27, 1999: The life and times of Sara Jane Olson |work=Star Tribune |location=Minneapolis |accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that rally, Soliah said that her fellow SLA members had been: {{quote|viciously attacked and murdered by 500 pigs in L.A. while the whole nation watched. Well, I believe that Gelina [Atwood] and her comrades fought until the last minutes, and though I would like to have her with me here right now, I know that she lived happy and she died happy. And in that sense, I'm so very proud of her. SLA soldiers – I know it is not necessary to say; but keep on fighting. I'm with you and we are with you!&lt;ref name="StarTribune"/&gt;}}

She asserted that Atwood "was a truly revolutionary woman ... among the first white women to fight so righteously for their beliefs and to die for what they believed in".&lt;ref name="LAWeekly2"&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/12254?page=2 "The Last Revolutionary: Sara Jane Olson Speaks"], Greg Goldin, ''LA Weekly'', January 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Now a fugitive, founding SLA member [[Emily Harris (SLA)|Emily Harris]] disguised herself and visited Soliah, who was on the job at a bookstore. Soliah later recalled, "I was glad she was alive. I expected them to be killed at any time." She felt sorry for the group and agreed to help the remaining group hide from the police and FBI.&lt;ref name="LAWeekly2"/&gt; She assisted them by procuring supplies for their San Francisco hideout and birth certificates of dead infants that could be used for identification purposes.&lt;ref name="LAWeekly2"/&gt;

===Crocker National Bank robbery and Myrna Opsahl murder===
On April 21, 1975, SLA members robbed the [[Crocker National Bank]] in [[Carmichael, California]], in the process killing 42-year-old [[Myrna Opsahl]], a mother of four depositing money for her church.&lt;ref name="MPR3"&gt;[http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200201/17_stoltzef_olson/ "Sara Jane Olson charged with murder"], Frank Stoltze, [[Minnesota Public Radio]], January 17, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAWeekly3"&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/12254?page=3 "The Last Revolutionary: Sara Jane Olson Speaks"], by Greg Goldin, ''LA Weekly'', January 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patty Hearst]], who was switch [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]] during the crime, provided the original information that led the police to implicate the SLA in the robbery and murder;&lt;ref name="MPR3"/&gt; she also stated that Soliah was one of the actual robbers.&lt;ref name="MPR3"/&gt; According to Hearst, Soliah also kicked a pregnant teller in the abdomen, leading to a [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postgazette.com/columnists/20010310roddy.asp "Payback from a long-forgotten account"], [[Dennis Roddy]], ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', March 10, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Several rounds of 9&amp;nbsp;mm ammunition spilled on the floor and found in Opsahl's body&lt;ref name="MPR4"/&gt; during the robbery bore manufacturing marks that matched that of ammunition loaded in a 9&amp;nbsp;mm [[Browning Hi-Power]] [[semi-automatic pistol]] found by police in Soliah's bedroom dresser drawer at the SLA safehouse on Precita Avenue in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="LAWeekly3"/&gt; In 2002, new [[forensics]] technology allowed police to link these shells definitively to those found at Crocker Bank prior to charging the former members of SLA, including Soliah, with the crime.&lt;ref name="MPR3"/&gt; Prosecutor Michael Latin said that Soliah was tied to the crime through fingerprints, a palm print, and handwriting evidence.&lt;ref name="LAWeekly3"/&gt; The palm print was found on a garage door from a garage in which the SLA kept a getaway car.&lt;ref name="foxnews"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,43343,00.html "Ex-Fugitive Sara Jane Olson Gets 20 Years to Life for 1975 Bomb Plot"] Fox News, January 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Angeles Police Department bombs===
On August 21, 1975, a bomb that came within 1/16 of an inch of detonating was discovered where a [[Los Angeles Police Department]] patrol car had been parked in front of an [[International House of Pancakes]] restaurant earlier in the day.&lt;ref name="MPR1"/&gt; After the bomb was discovered, all Los Angeles police were ordered to search under their cars, and another bomb was found in front of a police department about a mile away.&lt;ref name="MPR1"/&gt; Soliah was accused of planting the bombs in an attempt to avenge the SLA members who had died a year earlier in the standoff with LA police.&lt;ref name="MPR1"/&gt;

The [[pipe bomb]]s were rigged to detonate as the patrol cars drove away. One police officer present that day described the first bomb as one of "the most dangerous pipe bombs he had ever seen" and went on to say: {{quote|This device was designed to go off when that car was moved, and the only way you move a car is to get in and drive it. This bomb wasn't directed against property. It wasn't directed against the car. You could have thrown a device under the car and lit a fuse and then ran. It was directed at whoever got in the car and moved it, however it would have also taken out anybody in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="MPR1"/&gt;}}

At Soliah's 2002 sentencing hearing on the bombing, police officer John Hall,&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt; who had been in the car on top of the bomb described a little girl who stood feet away with her family: {{quote|Your honor, it horrifies me to think that the lives of dozens of innocent people, like that child in the window [would have ended] in an instant had the defendant and her co conspirators successfully carried out their terrorist acts.&lt;ref name="MPR4"&gt;[http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200201/18_stoltzef_olsonsentence/ "Ex-fugitive Sara Jane Olson sentenced to 20 years to life"] ''Minnesota Public Radio'', January 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soliah was indicted in 1976 for setting the police bombs along with five other SLA members, but vanished before the trial could commence.&lt;ref name="MPR1"/&gt; When Soliah was eventually brought to trial years later, the evidence against her was not considered by prosecutors to be a "slam dunk", although enough to convince a jury of her guilt.&lt;ref name="MPR1"/&gt; Two witnesses who had originally testified in her grand jury indictment had died by the time she was found and brought to trial: a plumber who had sold materials used in the bomb had picked Soliah out of a lineup as one of the buyers, and a bomb expert had stated the explosive could have been built in Soliah's apartment. Police could not identify any [[fingerprint]]s on the devices other than those of the officers who had disarmed them;&lt;ref name="MPR1"/&gt; however, Soliah's fingerprint, handwriting and signature were identified on a letter sent to order a fuse that could only be used for bomb-making purposes, and components matching those used in the police car bombs were found in a locked closet at the Precita Avenue hideout that Soliah lived in with the other members of SLA.&lt;ref name="LAWeekly3"/&gt;

==Underground life, capture, and prosecution==
[[File:1795Hillcrest.jpg|thumb|The house where Soliah lived under an assumed name in St. Paul, Minnesota]]
In February 1976, a grand jury indicted Soliah in the bombing case. Soliah went underground and became a fugitive for 23 years.

She moved to [[Minnesota]], having assumed the alias Sara Jane Olson; the surname chosen being one of the most common names in Minnesota due to the large number of people of [[Scandinavian-Americans]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Longtime fugitive is arrested after 23 years |date=June 17, 1999 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19990617&amp;id=8ptHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YX8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1029,3098319 |newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |location=Victoria, Texas |page=8A |accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 she married the physician Gerald Frederick "Fred" Peterson, with whom she would have three daughters. Olson and Peterson went to [[Zimbabwe]] for a while, where Peterson worked for a British Medical missionary group. Then they settled in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], where Olson resumed her acting career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The life and times of Sara Jane Olson |author=Chuck Haga|date=March 21, 2008|url= http://www.startribune.com/june-27-1999-the-life-and-times-of-sara-jane-olson/16894551/|newspaper= Star Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was active in Saint Paul on community issues.&lt;ref name="MPR4"/&gt; Her husband described the family as interested in [[Progressivism|progressive]] social causes.&lt;ref name="MPR4"/&gt;

On March 3, 1999, and again on May 15, 1999, Soliah was profiled on the ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' television program. After a tip generated by the show, she was arrested on June 16, 1999. Soliah was then charged with conspiracy to commit murder, possession of explosives, explosion, and attempt to ignite an explosive with intent to murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1885965,00.html | work=Time | title=Sara Jane Olson: American Housewife, American Terrorist | date=March 18, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | first=Alex | last=Altman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after her arrest, Soliah legally changed her name to her alias, Sara Jane Olson. She also published a [[cookbook]] titled ''Serving Time: America's Most Wanted Recipes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Olson |first=Sara Jane |date= 1999 |title= Serving Time: America's most wanted recipes |location= Minneapolis, Minnesota |publisher= Sara Olson Defense Fund Committee |isbn= 9780967847009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2001, she accepted a [[plea bargain]] and pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing explosives with intent to murder.&lt;ref name="MPR2"&gt;[http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/07/13_helmsm_sarajanesentence/ "Sara Jane Olson's 14-year prison sentence thrown out"] by Marisa Helms, Minnesota Public Radio, July 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a plea bargain, the other charges were dropped.

===Plea controversy===
Immediately after entering the plea, however, Olson told reporters that she was innocent and that she had decided to take a plea bargain due to the climate after the [[September 11 attacks]], in which she felt an accused bomber could not receive a fair trial from a jury.&lt;ref name="foxnews"/&gt; "It became clear to me that the incident would have a remarkable effect on the outcome of this trial ... the effect was probably going to be negative," she said. "That's really what governed this decision, not the truth or honesty, but what was probably in my best interests and the interests of my family."&lt;ref name="Angry"&gt;{{cite news| last = Declamecy| first = Dree| title = Angry judge orders hearing on Olson plea deal| publisher = [[CNN]] | date = November 1, 2001| url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/LAW/11/01/olson.plea/index.html| accessdate = 2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angered by Olson's announcement that she had lied in court, Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler ordered another hearing on November 6, at which he asked her several times if she was indeed guilty of the charges. Olson replied "I want to make it clear, Your Honor, that I did not make that bomb. I did not possess that bomb. I did not plant that bomb. But under the concept of aiding and abetting, I plead guilty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/11/14/MN113298.DTL&amp;type=printable "Now ex-fugitive Olson wants to stand trial"], Larry D. Hatfield, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', November 14, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, Olson filed a motion requesting to withdraw her guilty plea and acknowledged that she did not misunderstand the judge when he read the charges against her. Rather, she said: {{quote|I realize I cannot plead guilty when I know I am not. ... Cowardice prevented me from doing what I knew I should: Throw caution aside and move forward to trial. ... I am not second-guessing my decision as much as I have found the courage to take what I know is the honest course. Please, Judge Fidler, grant my request to go to trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Ex-fugitive seeks to withdraw plea in '70s SLA case| publisher = [[CNN]] | date = November 14, 2001| url = http://www.cnn.com/2001/LAW/11/14/olson.motion/index.html?related| accessdate = 2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sentencing in explosives charges===
On December 3, 2001, Fidler offered to let Olson testify under oath about her role in the case. She refused. He then wondered "I took those pleas twice ... were you lying to me then or are you lying to me now?"—and denied her request to withdraw her plea. Observers expected her to serve only three to five years, but on January 18, 2002, she was sentenced to two consecutive 10-years-to-life terms.&lt;ref name="MPR4"/&gt; Fidler warned that according to California law, the Board of Prison Terms could later change the sentence to a lesser term.&lt;ref name="MPR4"/&gt; Olson's lawyers asserted that due to discrepancies between 1970s laws and current California laws, their client would most likely serve only five years, which could turn into two years for good behavior.&lt;ref name="LAWeekly"/&gt; The Board of Prison Terms did later change the sentence.

At her sentencing hearing, Olson's teenage daughter Leila, her pastor, and her husband spoke in her defense, while Olson's mother claimed on the stand that Olson had never been a part of the SLA and spoke against prosecutors and police she asserted had harassed the family.&lt;ref name="MPR4"/&gt;

===Sentencing in Opsahl murder===
On January 16, 2002, first-degree murder charges for the killing of [[Myrna Opsahl]] were filed against Olson and four other SLA members: [[Emily Harris]], Bill Harris, [[Michael Bortin]] (Olson's brother-in law who had married her sister Josephine), and [[James Kilgore]], who remained a fugitive.&lt;ref name="MPR3"/&gt; Judge Fidler arraigned Olson on the murder charges immediately following her sentencing hearing on January 18.&lt;ref name="LAWeekly"/&gt; Olson pleaded not guilty to that charge at the time.&lt;ref name="LAWeekly"/&gt; On November 7, along with the other three defendants, she pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of second degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-11-08/news/0211080283_1_bank-slaying-sara-jane-olson-bank-robbery|title=4 ex-SLA members plead guilty to '75 bank slaying|last=|first=|date=November 8, 2002|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced on February 14, 2003, for the maximum term allowed under her [[plea bargain]], which was a six-year term&lt;ref name="MPR2"/&gt; [[Sentence (law)|concurrent]] to the 14-year sentence she was already serving.

==Incarceration and release==
The state Board of Prison Terms had scrapped her original sentence in October 2002 in exchange for a longer 14-year sentence, saying Olson's crimes had the potential for great violence and targeted multiple victims. In July 2004, a judge said there was "no analysis" of how the state Board of Prison Terms had decided 14 years was appropriate, and threw it out. Her sentence was instead converted to five years, four months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/07/13_helmsm_sarajanesentence/ "Sara Jane Olson's 14-year prison sentence thrown out"] Minnesota Public Radio News by Marisa Helms, July 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, an appeals court panel restored her full 14-year sentence as of April 12, 2007. It ruled that a lower court did not follow procedure when they allowed Olson to appeal.&lt;ref name="marieclaire.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070630115925/http://www.startribune.com/462/story/1120946.html "Sentence restored for Sara Jane Olson, former SLA member"] ''Star Tribune'' – April 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Olson served her time at the [[Central California Women's Facility]] in [[Chowchilla, California|Chowchilla]]. Her custody status was "Close A",&lt;ref name="A Life on Hold"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-olson14aug14,0,4408160.story?page=2&amp;coll=la-home-headlines "A Life on Hold in California Prison"] ''Los Angeles Times'', August 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; which is reserved for inmates requiring the most supervision. This status limited her privileges and required that she be counted seven times a day. It also prevented her from being able to seek a relocation to a facility closer to her home. David Nickerson, Olson's attorney, stated that this status reflected the Department of Corrections' view that she was a potential flight risk.&lt;ref name="A Life on Hold" /&gt;

Olson's husband and three daughters continued to support her during her imprisonment and took turns visiting her frequently in Chowchilla.&lt;ref name="marieclaire.com"&gt;[http://www.marieclaire.com/world/news/Mom-Secret-8 "When Mom Has A Secret: An Exclusive Report on a Family Torn Apart"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234138/http://www.marieclaire.com/world/news/Mom-Secret-8 |date=September 26, 2007 }}, Tara McKelvey, ''Marie Claire'' June 2007. Accessed June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''Marie Claire'' (coincidentally published by [[Hearst Corporation]]), Olson's 23-year-old daughter Emily Peterson dismissed her mother's radical past with the SLA, saying "She lived in Berkeley. It was kind of normal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/news/a507/mom-secret/ "When Mom Has A Secret: An Exclusive Report on a Family Torn Apart"], Tara McKelvey, ''Marie Claire'' June 2007.

===Release from prison and rearrest===
Olson was released on parole from the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla on March 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Sara-Jane-Olson-released-from-prison-3290801.php | title=Sara Jane Olson released from prison | first=Steve | last=Rubenstein | date=March 22, 2008 | work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; For five days, she stayed at her mother's home in Palmdale, and spent some time hiking with her husband.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/03/24/BA26VP644.DTL&amp;type=newsbayarea | title=SLA's Olson will fight return to state prison | first=John | last=Coté | date=March 24, 2008 | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2008, she was rearrested when it was decided that she had been mistakenly released a year early from prison due to a miscalculation by the parole board.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/22/olson.custody/index.html | title ='70s radical-turned-housewife back in prison |publisher=[[CNN]] | date = March 22, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her attorney claimed that the action was a political move.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt; Olson was taken back into custody by the California Department of Corrections and placed in the [[California Institution for Women]] in [[Corona, California|Corona]] for an additional year.&lt;ref name="Return"&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Harlow |authorlink= |author2= |title=March 23: A return to prison, not St. Paul |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/16927196.html |work=[[Star Tribune]] |location=Minneapolis |date=March 23, 2008 |accessdate=March 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321173018/http://www.startribune.com/local/16927196.html |archivedate=March 21, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release and parole===
After serving a total of seven years, about half of her sentence, Olson was released from prison on March 17, 2009, to serve her parole in Minnesota. Police unions in both Minnesota and California protested the arrangement, stating that they believe her parole should be served in California, where her crimes were committed.&lt;ref name="Associated"&gt;{{cite news |first=Don |last=Thompson |authorlink= |author2= |title=California due to release 1970s radical Olson |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iCvqJ7PjTjtpMIEhEaYSuR4dm0SQD96UL2D01|publisher=Associated Press |date=March 15, 2009 |accessdate=March 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], Minnesota Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]] also protested Olson being allowed to return to Minnesota.&lt;ref name="Letter"&gt;{{cite news |title=Document: letter from MN Gov.

===Daughter competes in ''American Idol''===
Olson's 28-year-old daughter, Sophia Shorai, was a contestant in [[American Idol (season 10)|the 2011 season]] of the talent show ''[[American Idol]]''.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite news |title='American Idol' contestant's link to LAPD attacks brings no protest from police union |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/02/american-idol-lapd.html |date=February 24, 2011 | work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[child beauty pageant]] is a beauty contest where contestants are usually under 16 years of age. There does not appear to be reliable statistics about the number of these pageants held each year around the world. They vary in style, and categories may include a talent segment as well as costume and theme wear. Contestants often wear makeup, fake teeth, [[Eyelash extensions|false eyelashes]], [[lipstick]], elaborate hairstyles with [[Artificial hair integrations|hair extensions]], and specially designed, sometimes provocative, outfits. Spray tanning and waxing are also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=16 Horrifying Child Beauty Pageant Pictures|url=http://firsttoknow.com/16-horrifying-child-beauty-pageant-pictures/|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ugly truth about beauty pageants|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/ugly-truth-about-beauty-pageants/news-story/715edcfaf127b65e929bbd67cef5f145|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contestants compete for prizes and are judged on the way they look and how they act on stage, similar to the judgment criteria in adult [[beauty pageant]]s. The way that the children look is clearly artificial and often detracts from their natural appearances. Many parents attribute confidence-building as one of the reasons they enter their children in [[beauty pageant]]s, but critics argue that the negative effects of beauty pageantry, especially the [[sexualization]] of young children, outweigh the positive intentions.


== Background ==
There are several components to sexualization that set it apart from healthy [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. Sexualization occurs when a person’s value comes only from his or her [[sexual appeal]] or [[behavior]], to the exclusion of other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Oppliger | first=Patrice | author-link = Patrice Oppliger | title = Girls gone skank: the sexualization of girls in American culture | year = 2008 | publisher = McFarland and Company Inc., Publishers | location = Jefferson, North Carolina |pages = 1–2 | isbn = 9780786435227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the [[American Psychological Association]] more specifically cites sexuality that is imposed on someone, rather than undertaken by choice, as evidence of sexualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, legal adulthood and ability to give [[consent]] typically does not come until age 18,{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} yet in child beauty pageants, the children's consenting parents permit them to participate, pay their entry fees, dress them, and train them to perform on stage in front of judges and an audience.

In preparation for these beauty pageants, children have their appearances altered by costumes, makeup, and other products to the point that they resemble dolls, which [[objectification|objectifies]] them at a very young age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=Myke|title=Sex Sells: Child Sexualization and the Media|journal=Screen Education|year=2008|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child perceives that sexuality is not only encouraged but can be a means to an end.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt; The child pageant industry involves thousands of contestants and $5 billion a year in revenue,&lt;ref name=Truthout&gt;{{cite web|last=Giroux|first=Henry A.|title=Child Beauty Pageants: A Scene From the "Other America"|url=http://archive.truthout.org/051109a|work=Truthout|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and television networks air in-demand shows like ''[[Toddlers &amp; Tiaras]]'' and ''[[Little Miss Perfect]]''. The viewership implies that many adults not only condone these activities but also the view of children as sexual objects.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt;

=== Bikini contests of minors===
''Miss Tanguita'', which translates as "Miss Child Bikini", is held in Barbosa, Santader, [[Colombia]] as annual part of the "del Rio Suarez" Festival. Activists say that the competition, though legal, abuses the human rights of minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pekanbaru.tribunnews.com/2015/01/14/wah-kontes-ratu-bikini-anak-anak-digelar-di-negara-ini |title=Wah, Kontes Ratu Bikini Anak-anak Digelar di Negara Ini |author=Raya Desmawanto Nainggolan |date=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2016, the [[Miss Teen USA]] pageant removed the swimsuit competition and replaced it with an athleticwear round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/shows/total_divas/news/781840/first-look-see-what-miss-teen-usa-contestants-will-wear-instead-of-bikinis|title=First Look! See What Miss Teen USA Contestants Will Wear Instead of Bikinis on Total Divas|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support for participation ==
Despite criticism of child beauty pageants, contestants' parents continue to argue for the positive impact these competitions have on their children's personal development. Supporters often cite self-confidence and poise as attributes that children learn during the pageant process, and still more defend pageants as being similar to other athletic, music, or educational programs. Since young girls like playing dress up and enjoy participating in beauty pageants, they argue, they are positive events.&lt;ref name=Michael /&gt; The Pageant Director for the Cities of America preliminary pageant system echoes these sentiments and argues that pageants are good for girls—they develop self-confidence by actively trying to be a part of something, they compete with others through a fair process, and they enjoy meeting others with similar interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jen|title=Pageantry With Purpose|url=http://nationalsteenpageants.wordpress.com/about/|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to communicate and network with others is an important skill that children learn at a young age when participating in beauty pageants. Through pageants, children also learn how to communicate with adults.&lt;ref name="Kids Formal" /&gt;

One pageant mother insists that pageants have helped her daughter "gain poise, [[confidence]], [[Showmanship (performing)|showmanship]], [[discipline]] and grace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Beauty Pageants Are Good For Girls|url=http://shine.yahoo.com/parenting/why-beauty-pageants-are-good-for-girls-2447925.html|publisher=Shine from Yahoo|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be true for some contestants, as the child's attitude typically derives from the parent. When the parents embrace a positive attitude, the children will follow. In these cases, pageants can teach children how to be gracious winners and good losers. They will learn the aspects of rules, and fair play. Thus, pageants teach children how to be calm, cool, and collected in front of crowds. Supporters believe participants learn tenacity when they fail and must move on, and they practice arduously trying to achieve something which proves even more valuable when they are successful.&lt;ref name="Kids Formal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits of Child Beauty Pageants|url=http://www.kidsformal.com/product-p/benefits%20of%20child%20beauty%20pagea.htm|publisher=Kids Formal|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From some child contestants' perspectives, pageants are fun and a way to make new friends, and they are able to feel good about their friends winning.&lt;ref name=Michael&gt;{{cite web|last=Inbar|first=Michael|title=Parents defend Putting their kids in beauty pageants|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/28873086/ns/today-parenting_and_family/t/parents-defend-putting-their-kids-beauty-pageants/#.T5SX0hxztZ4|publisher=Today Parenting|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of sexualization in child pageants==
One critic debunks these claims by questioning the age-appropriateness of these pageants and whether they achieve any positive outcomes or not. After all, playing [[dress-up]] does not result in one winner and many losers, and children may enjoy appeasing parents rather than the activity itself.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt; A writer for the [[New York Times]], criticized child beauty pageants because participants and viewers impose adulthood on children while still expecting them to radiate innocence.&lt;ref name=Karen&gt;{{cite web|last=De Witt|first=Karen|title=Never Too Young to Be Perfect|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/12/weekinreview/never-too-young-to-be-perfect.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Vernon R. Wiehe, professor in the [[University of Kentucky]] College of Social Work, states, "sexualization occurs through little girls wearing adult women's clothing in diminutive sizes, the use of makeup which often is applied by makeup consultants, spray tanning the body, the dying of hair and the use of hair extensions, and assuming provocative postures more appropriate for adult models".&lt;ref name=Vernon&gt;{{cite web|last=Vernon|first=Wiehe|title=Nothing Pretty in Child Pageants|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2011/08/14/1844981/nothing-pretty-in-child-pageants.html|publisher=kentucky.com|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many view the child's appearance as obscene or inappropriate.

They are dressed in revealing clothes or evening gowns, and some children wear high heels. Children are in “Child Beauty Pageants” only because of their age. These children are judged along the same criteria as an adult pageant woman would be judged on. Stated by Laura Pappano, in a New York Times featuring child pageants, "beauty pageants in particular blur the lines between what is cute and what is sensual.&lt;ref name=Karen /&gt; "This is not about cutest baby contests, which most people would see as harmless enough, but rather about adult-like competitions featuring kids pretending to be sexy adults".{{cite web|last=Korn|first=Neer|title=Nanny state ok when it comes to kids and sex|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/nanny-state-ok-when-it-comes-to-kids-and-sex-20110517-1eqnl.html|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carleton Kendrick, a family therapist out of Boston says, "At its core, [pageants are] teaching girls that the best thing [they] can do, and the most attention they can get is to view [themselves] as an assemblage of body parts. And that you will focus on drawing attention to those body parts sets them up for all manner of problems in their lives — self-esteem, eating disorders, relationships they enter into".&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=Mandy|title=Toddlers and Tears: The Sexualization of Young Girls|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865567072/Toddlers-and-Tears-The-sexualization-of-young-girls.html?pg=all|publisher=deseretnews.com|accessdate=6 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of child sexualization==
In reports of children being sexually abused research shows that the sexualization of children is a contributing factor to their abuse.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt; Also, if the child is winning constantly in a competition that is based primarily on her looks, she is more likely to develop [[psychological]] issues later on in life, such as depression, low self-esteem, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite book | last = APA Task Force | author-link = American Psychological Association | title = Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report.aspx | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | date = 2010 | oclc = 123130352 }} [http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/girls/report-full.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a link to lowered sexual efficacy and contraceptive use later in life.

"'Some critics contend that the child beauty pageant culture fails to acknowledge that "sexualized images of little girls may have dangerous implications in a world where 450,000 American children were reported as victims of sexual abuse in 1993."&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, Henry. "Child Beauty Pageants and the Politics of Innocence." ''Nymphatic ''Fantasies'''' 16 (1998). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lucia Grosaru states, in her Everyday Psychology article, “contests promote physical beauty as a main value, complimented of course by the “special talent” and “warm hearts”. A child, especially a female that is going to pay so much attention to her looks and that knows she is being assessed for it, is very prone to develop [[eating disorder]]s, such as [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] or [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grosaru|first=Lucia|title=Toddlers and Children Beauty Pageants- Risk Factors for Severe Psychological Turmoils|url=http://psychologycorner.com/toddlers-and-children-beauty-pageants-risk-factors-for-severe-psychological-turmoils/|publisher=Psychology Corner|accessdate=27 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds and thousands of dollars are spent on [[costumes]], [[cosmetics]], and even beauty consultants. Some question what does, in fact, happen to a child's self-esteem if she loses the pageant after her parents have spent so much money on it.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt;

Martina M. Cartwright, an adjunct professor of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Arizona, states in her article on child beauty pageants, “many experts agree that participation in activities that focus on physical appearance at an early age can influence teen and/or adult self-esteem, body image and self-worth. Issues with self-identity after a child "retires" from the pageant scene in her teens are not uncommon.  Struggles with perfection, dieting, eating disorders and body image can take their toll in adulthood”.&lt;ref name=Martina&gt;{{cite web|last=Cartwright|first=Martina|title=Child Beauty Pageants: What Are We Teaching Our Girls?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/food-thought/201108/child-beauty-pageants-what-are-we-teaching-our-girls|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers are usually involved in their child's participation in pageants, so there's a lot of information regarding their outlook on the contests. Social worker Mark Sichel believes that many mothers "push their daughters into pageants because of their own low self-esteem, or as compensation for a perceived lack of attention and admiration in their own lives". As a result of these mother's constant pushing, many of these young girls feel as if they let their mothers down by losing.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Lucy|title=Darling Divas Or Damaged Daughters?

One father writes, "the mothers of the young pageant contestants all push their girls, some young as two, to emotional and physical limits. They parade the little girls around in makeup, big hairdos, and even bathing suits...I don’t see how a beauty pageant, especially at such young ages, promotes anything other than [[vanity]]."&lt;ref name=D.L.&gt;{{cite web|last=Chandler|first=D.L.|title=No Child Beauty Pageants For My Daughter Please|url=http://thefatherfactor.blogspot.com/2012/03/no-child-beauty-pageants-for-my.html|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, after a 10-year-old girl was featured on the cover of [[Vogue Paris]] in an inappropriate outfit- not fit for a child, lawmakers banned child beauty pageants all together.&lt;ref name=D.L. /&gt;

So much effort and time goes into the preparation for a pageant. Children must constantly be practicing their routines, and creating their pageant look, so they have limited time to play. Through play itself, children develop skills they use the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name=Vernon /&gt;

The '''[[Style (manner of address)|style]] of [[king of Portugal|Portuguese sovereign]]''' has varied over the years. Currently, there is no [[Portuguese monarch]] but there is a pretender: [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza]]. He styles himself following some of the ancient traditions of the Portuguese monarchy.

During the history of Portuguese monarchy, the Portuguese kings used the following styles:

[[File:sweatshop-1890.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|A sweatshop in the United States c.1890]] 
'''Sweatshop''' (or '''sweat factory''') is a pejorative term for a [[workplace]] that has very poor, [[Socially acceptable|socially unacceptable]] working conditions.

==History==
[[File:Sweatshop in Ludlow Street Tenement, New York cph.3a24271.jpg |thumb|right|A sweatshop in a New York tenement building, c. 1889]]

A sweatshop is a factory or workshop, especially in the [[clothing industry]], where manual workers are employed at very low wages for long hours under poor conditions and many health risks.

Many workplaces through history have been crowded, low-paying and without job security; but the concept of a sweatshop originated between 1830 and 1850 as a specific type of workshop in which a certain type of middleman, the ''sweater'', directed others in garment making (the process of producing clothing) under arduous conditions. The terms ''sweater'' for the middleman and ''sweat system'' for the process of subcontracting [[piecework]] were used in early critiques like [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''Cheap Clothes and Nasty'', written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the '''sweating system''', a system of subcontracting in the [[tailor]]ing trade were called ''sweatshops'' and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 and more.

Between 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted the rural poor to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the [[tenement]]s of New York's [[Lower East Side]]. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and [[rat]] infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.

In the 1890s, a group calling itself the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] was formed in [[Melbourne]] and campaigned successfully for a [[minimum wage]] via trade boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/goldstein-vida-jane-6418|title=Goldstein, Vida Jane (1869–1949)|last=Brownfoot|first=Janice N.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]].&lt;ref name=Blackburn&gt;Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43–64 "Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] was founded to try to improve the condition of these workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/worklaborunions/a/ilgwu.htm|title=ILGWU|website=About.com Education|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulation and [[labor laws]]. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term ''sweatshop'' came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], known as [[muckraker]]s, wrote exposés of business practices, and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable exposés of sweatshop conditions include [[Jacob Riis]]' [[photo journalism|photo documentary]] ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', a fictionalized account of the [[meat packing industry]].

Emphasis on general conditions in the... - NARA - 518630.jpg|thumb|[[Lewis Hine]] noted poor working conditions when he photographed workers at the Western Dress Factory in [[Millville, New Jersey]], for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]'s National Research Project (1937)]]

In 1911, negative public perceptions of sweatshops were galvanized by the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in New York City. The pivotal role of this time and place is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the [[Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site]]. While trade unions, [[minimum wage]] laws, [[fire safety]] codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the [[developed world]], they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the [[developing world]].

In a report issued in 1994, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] found that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a ''sweatshop'' as any "employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial [[homeworker|homework]], occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/he95029.pdf |format=PDF |title=Garment Industry : Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops |publisher=Gao.gov |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced, and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the [[Third World]] and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Sweatshops are also sometimes implicated in [[human trafficking]] when workers have been tricked into starting work without [[informed consent]], or when workers are kept at work through [[debt bondage]] or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sometimes [[penal labor]] facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective.

Chinese sweatshops known to have increased numbers of suicidal employees have suicide nets covering the whole site, in place to stop over-worked and stressed employees leaping to their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2103798/Revealed-Inside-Apples-Chinese-sweatshop-factory-workers-paid-just-1-12-hour.html|title=Inside Apple’s Chinese Sweatshop Factory Workers Are Paid Just £1.12 Per Hour to Produce iPads and iPhones For the West|publisher=Dailymail.co.uk|date=January 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary use of the term==
[[File:Lindintracuay.jpg|thumb|right|A modern-day sweatshop]]
The phrase sweatshop was coined in 1850, meaning a factory or workshop where workers are treated unfairly, for example having low wages, working long hours and in poor conditions. Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York for more than one century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create ‘sweating system’ of workers. (Blackburn, 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, S. (1991) Ideology and social policy. The Historical Journals.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s. This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.

World-known fashion brands such as [[H&amp;M]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]] and [[Uniqlo]] are all involved in such issues of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshops protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation, [[Human Rights Now!]], Hong Kong Labour Organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour ([[Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour|SACOM]]) protested for the “harsh and dangerous” working conditions in Uniqlo's value-added factories in China.

The fast-fashion brands are not the only one who involve with sweat factories.

Adidas was subjected to the issues of underpayment, overtime working, physical abuse and child labour. Another sportswear giant, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], is recently facing a heavy wave of anti-sweatshops protests in the US. They are organised by the United Student Against Sweatshops ([[United Student Against Sweatshops|USAS]]) and were held in Boston, Washington D.C., Bangalore and San Pedro Sula. They claimed that workers in Nike's contract factory in Vietnam are suffering from wage theft, verbal abuse and harsh working conditions with ‘temperatures over the legal limit of 90 degrees’(Bain, 2017)&lt;ref&gt;Bain, M.

Since the 1990s, Nike was reported of employing sweat factories and child labour. Regardless of its effort to turn things around, Nike's image has been affected by the issue during the past two decades. Nike established an independent department which aimed to improve workers’ life in 1996. It was renamed as Fair Labor Association in 1999 and is a non-profit organisation which includes representatives from companies, human right and labour unions to work on monitoring and management of labour rights (Nisen, 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Nisen, M.

==Anti-sweatshop movement==
Some of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.

Ultimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery – [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|year=2003|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|publisher=Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the first effective [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|title=Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8|work=finduslaw.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|archivedate=2008-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of [[North Olmsted]], in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]], introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/12-4-97_sweatshopban.html|title=Village Life News: Ban on Sweatshop Products Becomes Rule|website=www.villagelife.org|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President [[Bill Clinton]] to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Clothing and footwear [[Factory|factories]] overseas have progressively improved working conditions because the high demand of [[anti-sweatshop movement]], labour right advocates.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/anti-sweatshop-movement-achieving-gains-overseas|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Is Achieving Gains Overseas {{!}} International Labor Rights Forum|website=www.laborrights.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure. Around the working conditions from college students, and other opponents of sweatshops which has led to some of the powerful companies like [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the Gap who have agreed to cut back on [[child labour]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; restrict the use of dangerous and poisonous [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], and drop the average rate of employees working 80 hour weeks, according to groups that monitor such factories. Labour advocates say, this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being under paid, under appreciated and working in an unsafe environment.

Recently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018. &lt;ref&gt;CBNEditor. (2018, May 26). 10 Chinese Provinces Raise Minimum Wages Levels in 2018. Retrieved September 21, 2018, from China Banking News: http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/05/26/10-chinese-provinces-raise-minimum-wages-level-since-start-2018/&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this governments are also enforcing stricter labor laws such as in 2013 after the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, a large 5 storied sweatshops that killed 1135 people due to the building not being up to code, Bangladeshi police shut down many other factories after safety checks were completed and not met. However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quote's or statistic's, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies production methods without any censorship and thus forces brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because it is now very for a brands exemplary reputation to be completely destroyed by a bystander with a smart phone who happens to see a brands product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely and simply uploading their findings. If a brands reputation is negative they are likely to lose customers as more and more consumers begin to care about sustainable and ethical products thus the fewer consumers the fewer sales and the less profit.

However, social media isn’t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing for companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently. For example, in May 2017 Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign, both organizations that are working towards abolishing sweatshops as well as creating a world of sustainable and ethical apparel practices, worked together to create The Women Power Fashion Pop-up &lt;ref&gt;Hendriksz, V.

&lt;/ref&gt;. The event took place in Amsterdam and allowed consumers to sit in a room designed to look and feel like a sweatshop and were forced to create 100 ties in an hour which is synonymous to that of the expectations of women working in sweatshops today &lt;ref&gt;Hendriksz, V.

&lt;/ref&gt;.This pop-up allowed consumers to actually experience the life of a sweatshop worker for a limited time period and thus made them more sympathetic to the cause. Outside of the pop-up was a petition that consumers could sign in order to convince brands to be more transparent with their clothing manufacturing processes &lt;ref&gt;Hendriksz, V. (2017, May 17).

&lt;/ref&gt;. The campaign went viral and created a significant buzz for the anti-sweatshop movement as well as the work of Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign.

Currently, there is a major issue with the anti-sweatshop movement as where do supporters place the displaced workers? Even after escaping the sweatshop industry the workers need a job to sustain themselves and their families. For example, in Bangladesh, a country in which has one of the lowest minimum wages in the world, of $68 per month &lt;ref&gt;The Guardian. (2016, July 18).

==Contributing factors==

===Globalization===
{{main|globalization}}

There are plenty of causes that lead to the occurrence of this yet to be solved this global issue. Among them, globalisation is the main cause undeniably. The Bangladesh factory tragedy and the moralists of sweatshop economics.&lt;ref&gt;Balko, R. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;. Sweatshops and globalisation. Retrieved September 20, 2017 from A World Connected, web site:  A%20World%20Connected%20%20Sweatshops%20and%20Globalization.htm&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that when the world markets are opened to free trade under globalisation, a phenomenon of “race to the bottom” happens. Sweatshop is an obvious example of such phenomenon. Without transnational guidelines and regulations, large corporations in developed countries are moving their manufacturing plants to the countries that are more vulnerable, such as with less environmental restrictions and lower labour standards. To meet the demands and compete for the patronage, factories in developing countries start to lower their labour regulations by providing minimum wages and ignoring workplace safety requirements. As a result, workers in developing countries face the hardship while the large corporations gain profit.

====Modern anti-globalization movement====

{{main|anti-globalization movement}}
More recently, the [[anti-globalization movement]] has arisen in opposition to corporate [[globalization]], the process by which [[multinational corporation]]s move their operations [[overseas]] to lower costs and increase profits. The anti-sweatshop movement has much in common with the [[anti-globalization movement]]. Both consider sweatshops harmful, and both have accused many companies (such as the [[Walt Disney Company]], [[The Gap (clothing retailer)|The Gap]], and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]) of using sweatshops. Some in these movements charge that [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization is similar to the [[sweating system]], arguing that there tends to be a "[[race to the bottom]]" as multinationals leap from one low-wage country to another searching for lower production costs, in the same way that ''sweaters'' would have steered production to the lowest cost sub-contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairworkplace.org/articles/the-problem/the-race-to-the-bottom-insights-on-how-it-affects-corporate-executives.html |title=Fair Workplace Council Sweatshop Free Electronics – The Race to the Bottom |publisher=Fairworkplace.org |date=April 25, 2007 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various groups support or embody the anti-sweatshop movement today. The [[National Labor Committee]] brought sweatshops into the mainstream media in the 1990s when it exposed the use of sweatshop and child labor to sew clothing for Kathie Lee Gifford's Wal-Mart label. United Students Against Sweatshops is active on college campuses. The [[International Labor Rights Fund]] filed a lawsuit&lt;ref&gt;''[http://laborrights.org/projects/corporate/walmart/WalMartComplaint091305.pdf Jane Doe et all v.

Social critics complain that sweatshop workers often do not earn enough money to buy the products that they make, even though such items are often commonplace goods such as T-shirts, shoes, and toys. In 2003, Honduran garment factory workers were paid US$0.24 for each $50 [[Sean John]] sweatshirt, $0.15 for each long-sleeved T-shirt, and only five cents for each short-sleeved shirt – less than one-half of one percent of the retail price.&lt;ref name="seanjohn"&gt;{{cite web| title =Sean John Setisa Report| publisher =[[National Labor Committee]]|date=October 2003| url =http://www.nlcnet.org/article.php?id=103| accessdate =May 31, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070522173501/http://www.nlcnet.org/article.php?id=103 |archivedate = May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even comparing international costs of living, the $0.15 that a Honduran worker earned for the long-sleeved T-shirt was equal in [[purchasing power]] to $0.50 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2004&amp;ey=2008&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=268&amp;s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&amp;grp=0&amp;a=&amp;pr.x=39&amp;pr.y=9 |title=Honduras|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries where labor costs are low, bras that cost US$5–7 apiece retail for US$50 or more in American stores. {{asof|2006}}, female garment workers in Sri Lanka earned about US$2.20 per day.&lt;ref name=watson&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Noshua|title=MAS Holdings: Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility in the Apparel Industry|url=http://www.unprme.org/reports/masholdingsfinalinseadcasefeb28th2006.pdf|publisher=INSEAD|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor historian Erik Loomis claims that the conditions faced by workers in the United States in the [[Gilded Age]] have been replicated in developing countries where Western corporations utilize sweatshop labor. In particular, he compares the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 New York to the [[2013 Savar building collapse|collapse of Rana Plaza]] in 2013 Bangladesh. He argues that the former galvanized the population to political activism that eventually pushed through reforms not only pertaining to workplace safety, but also the [[minimum wage]], the [[eight-hour day]], [[workers' compensation]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], and the [[Clean Water Act]]. American corporations responded by shifting production to developing nations where such protections did not exist. Loomis elaborates:

{{cquote|So in 2013, when over 1100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire. The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle. This separation of production from consumption is an intentional move by corporations precisely to avoid being held responsible by consumers for their actions. And it is very effective.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Eric Kaufmann (July 6, 2015).

In 1997, economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] said, "My concern is not that there are too many sweatshops, but that there are too few."&lt;ref name="meyerson"&gt;{{cite news| last =Meyerson| first =Allen| title =In Principle, A Case for More 'Sweatshops'|work=The New York Times| date =June 22, 1997| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E6D8103EF931A15755C0A961958260| accessdate =April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sachs and other proponents of [[free trade]] and the global movement of capital cite the economic theory of [[comparative advantage]], which states that [[international trade]] will, in the long run, make all parties better off. The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do "better" than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.

When asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' [[standard of living]], those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over [[subsistence farming]] and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or [[starvation]] by unemployment.&lt;ref name="meyerson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Kristof| first =Nicholas| authorlink =Nicholas Kristof| title =Inviting All Democrats| work =The New York Times| date =January 14, 2004| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120526094048/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| dead-url =yes| archive-date =May 26, 2012| accessdate =April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweatshops, not only offer better jobs then what are available in the local communities but the wages that the workers receive lead to a better standard of living for the workers and their families. Raveena Aulkah a journalist for Mail Online News went undercover as a sweatshop worker and documented her experience. One of her main takeaways was that even though working conditions were not optimal the families could now afford "goats, schooling, and clothing for their families".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2456412/My-life-sweatshop-worker-Undercover-reporter-tells-crushing-work-terrible-pay-girl-boss-aged-just-NINE.html|title=My life as a sweatshop worker: Undercover reporter tells of crushing work and terrible pay under girl boss aged just NINE - Daily Mail Online|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation. After the [[Child Labor Deterrence Act]] was introduced in the US, an estimated 50,000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in Asia, leaving many to resort to jobs such as "stone-crushing, street hustling, and prostitution." [[UNICEF]]'s 1997 ''State of the World's Children'' study found these alternative jobs "more hazardous and exploitative than garment production."&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite conference| first =Carol| last =Bellamy| authorlink =Carol Bellamy| title =An Agreement in Bangladesh| booktitle =The State of the World's Children 1997| pages =66| publisher =[[United Nations Children's Fund]]| year =1997| url =http://www.unicef.org/sowc97/download/sow2of2.pdf| accessdate =May 31, 2007| isbn = 0-19-262871-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Nobel prize-winning economist [[Paul Krugman]] states in a 1997 article for Slate, "as manufacturing grows in poor countries, it creates a ripple effect that benefits ordinary people: 'The pressure on the land becomes less intense, so rural wages rise; the pool of unemployed urban dwellers always anxious for work shrinks, so factories start to compete with each other for workers, and urban wages also begin to rise.' In time average wages creep up to a level comparable to minimum-wage jobs in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manjoo |first=Farhad |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/1997/03/in_praise_of_cheap_labor.html |title=In Praise of Cheap Labor – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy-handed responses to reports of child labor and worker rights abuses such as widespread boycotts can be counterproductive if the net effect is simply to eliminate contracts with suppliers rather than to reform their employment practices.  A 2005 article in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' states, "For example, in Honduras, the site of the infamous [[Kathy Lee Gifford]] sweatshop scandal, the average apparel worker earns $13.10 per day, yet 44 percent of the country's population lives on less than $2 per day... In Cambodia, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Honduras, the average wage paid by a firm accused of being a sweatshop is more than double the average income in that country's economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Don't get into a lather over sweatshops |first=Benjamin |last=Powell |first2=David |last2=Skarbek |newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=August 2, 2005 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0802/p09s02-coop.html |accessdate=December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On three documented occasions during the 1990s, anti-sweatshop activists in rich countries have apparently caused increases in [[child prostitution]] in poor countries. In Bangladesh, the closure of several sweatshops run by a German company put Bangladeshi children out of work, and some ended up working as prostitutes, turning to crime, or starving to death. In Pakistan, several sweatshops closed, including ones run by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Reebok]], and other corporations—which caused some of those Pakistani children to turn to prostitution. In Nepal, a carpet manufacturing company closed several sweatshops, resulting in thousands of Nepalese girls turning to prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,119125,00.html |title=Third World Workers Need Western Jobs |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=2004-05-06 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1996 study of corporate codes of conduct in the apparel industry by the U.S. Department of Labor has concluded that corporate codes of conduct that monitor labor norms in the apparel industry, rather than boycott or eliminate contracts upon the discovery of violations of internationally recognized labor norms, are a more effective way to eliminate child labor and the exploitation of children, provided they provide for effective monitoring that includes the participation of workers and their knowledge of the standards to which their employers are subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Apparel Industry and Codes of Conduct: A Solution to the International Child Labor Problem? |author=U.S. Department of Labor |url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/apparel/overview.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202211838/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/apparel/overview.htm |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, the United States underwent a similar process during its own industrialization where child labor and the suppression of worker organizations were prevalent.  According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.

In contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America—and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show.&lt;ref name="Corporations and Worker's Rights"&gt;{{cite web| first =Anup| last =Shah| title=Corporations and Workers Rights |publisher =Global Issues| url =http://www.globalissues.org/article/57/corporations-and-workers-rights| accessdate =May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty. According to a November 2001 [[BBC]] article, in the previous two months, 100,000 sweatshop workers in Bangladesh had been put off work. The workers petitioned their government to lobby the U.S. government to repeal its trade barriers on their behalf to retain their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bangladesh wants textiles curbs lifted |newspaper=BBC News   |date=November 12, 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1650952.stm |accessdate=December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of sweatshops cite Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan as recent examples of countries that benefited from having sweatshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tqe.quaker.org/2003/TQE087-EN-ProductCycle.html |title=The Quaker Economist #87 - The Product Cycle and Globalization |publisher=Tqe.quaker.org |date=2003-11-01 |accessdate=2015-03-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414171102/http://tqe.quaker.org/2003/TQE087-EN-ProductCycle.html|archivedate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case for Sweatshops|date=2000-02-07|url=http://www.hoover.org/pubaffairs/dailyreport/archive/2864991.html|website=Hoover Institution|publisher=Stanford University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125151321/http://www.hoover.org/pubaffairs/dailyreport/archive/2864991.html|archivedate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted, however, that in these countries, legislative and regulatory frameworks to protect and promote labor rights and the rights of workers against unsafe and exploitative working conditions exist, and studies have shown no systematic relationship between labor rights, such as collective bargaining and the freedom of association, and national economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Drusilla K. |last=Brown |first2=Alan V. |last2=Deardorff |first3=Robert M. |last3=Stern |url=http://ipc.umich.edu/working-papers/pdfs/ipc-119-brown-deardorff-stern-labor-standards-human-rights-international-trade-investment.pdf|format=PDF|title= Labor Standards and Human Rights: Implications for International Trade and Investment|publisher= International Policy Center, University of Michigan|date=19 August 2011|accessdate=2015-03-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528014516/http://ipc.umich.edu/working-papers/pdfs/ipc-119-brown-deardorff-stern-labor-standards-human-rights-international-trade-investment.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of fast fashion===
{{main|fast fashion}}
A trend called "fast fashion" has also contributed to the rise of sweatshops. Fast fashion refers to “rapid reorders and new orders that retailers now exert as they discern sales trends in real time” (Ross, 2015)&lt;ref&gt;Ross, R. J. S. (2015). The high toll of fast fashion. Dissent. Retrieved September 20,2017 from Dissent, web site :https://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/the-true-cost-review-fastfashion-rana-plaza-accord{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}.&lt;/ref&gt; To catch up with the fast-changing fashion trends to satisfy increasing customers’ demand, these fast-fashion brands have to react and arrange production accordingly. To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders in a short period of time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, “[[The True Cost]]” (2015), claims that sweatshops relieve pressure on retailers by passing it factory owners and, ultimately, workers.

===Government corruption and immature labour protection legislation===
Government corruptions and inadequate labour protection legislation in developing countries have also contributed to the suffering of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted capitalists to invest in these developing countries, which is also a serious problem that leads to arisen of sweatshops. Without reasonable law restrictions, capitalists are able to set up fashion manufacturing plants at a lower cost. According to Zamen (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Zamen, I. (2012) Corruption and the fate of the people who make your clothes. Transparency International. Retrieved September 20, 2017 from Transparency International, web site: http:// blog.transparency.org/2012/12/07/corruption-and-the-fate-of-the-people-who-makeyour-clothes/.&lt;/ref&gt;, governments in the developing countries often fail to enforce safety standards in local factories because of corruptions and weak law enforcement. These weaknesses allow factories to provide dangerous working conditions for their workers. With reference to the Corruption Perception Index 2016 (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International (2017). Corruption perception index 2016. Retrieved September 20, 2017 from https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016.&lt;/ref&gt;, those countries with high risk of corruption such as Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Pakistan and China are reported to have larger numbers of unsafe garments factories operating inside the countries. When Zamen (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Zamen, I. (2012) Corruption and the fate of the people who make your clothes.Transparency International. Retrieved September 20, 2017 from Transparency International, web site: http:// blog.transparency.org/2012/12/07/corruption-and-the-fate-of-the-people-who-makeyour-clothes/.&lt;/ref&gt; said “corruption kills”, sweatshops in developing countries would be the prime cases.

===Low education level===
It is suggested that these workers should fight back and protect their own labour rights, yet a lot of them in developing countries are ignorant about their own right because of low education level. According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016)&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Insititute of Statistics, (2016) Population by minimum completed level of education.&lt;/ref&gt;, most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison, A. &amp; Scorse, J. (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, A. &amp; Scorse, J. (2004) The Nike effect: Anti-sweatshop activists and labor market outcomes in Indonesia. Economics department of Yale University.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule). Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.

==Impacts of sweatshops==
===Child labour===
{{main|child labour}}
Child labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013)&lt;ref&gt;International Labor Office (2013). Making progress against child labour. Retrieved from http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;, more than 250 million children are in the employment of which 170 million of them are engaged in textiles and garments industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Moulds, J. (2013) Child labor in the fashion supply chain. theguardian. Retrieved from https://labs.theguardian.com/unicef-child-labour/.&lt;/ref&gt; Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child labour are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton picking, it becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.

===Environmental pollution===
Not only workers are impacted by sweatshops, but the neighboring environment as well, through lax environmental laws set up in developing countries to help reduce the production cost of the fashion industry. Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 150 cubics of liquid waste daily. (Stanko, 2013)&lt;ref&gt;Stanko, N. (2013). Sweatshops. Greeniacs Nation. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.greeniacs.com/GreeniacsArticles/Consumer-Products/Sweatshops.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107011248/http://www.greeniacs.com/GreeniacsArticles/Consumer-Products/Sweatshops.html |archivedate=2017-11-07 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The daily life of local people is significantly affected as Buriganga River is their source of bathing, irrigation and transportation. Many workers in the tanneries suffer from serious skin illness since they are exposed to toxic chemicals for long period of time. Air is being highly polluted in such area because the factories do not install proper ventilation facilities. Sweatshops is also an environmental issue as it is not only causing harm to the human right of labour but also their living environment.

==Sweatshop-free==
{{Main|Sweatshop-free}}
[[Sweatshop-free]] is a term the fashion brand [[American Apparel]] created to mean coercion-free, fair-compensation for garment workers who make their products.&lt;ref name=aaworkers&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://www.americanapparel.net/aboutus/verticalint/workers/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610043456/http://www.americanapparel.net/aboutus/verticalint/workers/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 June 2012 |title=Sweatshop-free.

This is a '''timeline of feminism in the United States'''. It contains feminist and antifeminist events. It should contain events within the ideologies and philosophies of feminism and antifeminism. It should, however, '''not''' contain material about changes in women's legal rights: for that, see ''[[Timeline of women's legal rights in the United States (other than voting)]]'', or, if it concerns the right to vote, to ''[[Timeline of women's suffrage in the United States]]''.

==Timeline of feminism in the United States==
;19th and early 20th century
* [[First-wave feminism]] was a period of feminist activity and thought, that occurred within the time period of the 19th and early 20th century throughout the world. It focused on legal issues, primarily on gaining women's suffrage (the right to vote).
; 1960s
* 1963: ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' was published; it is a book written by [[Betty Friedan]] which is widely credited with starting the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/us/betty-friedan-who-ignited-cause-in-feminine-mystique-dies-at-85.html|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85|date=5 February 2006|author=Margalit Fox|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jwa.org/thisweek/feb/17/1963/betty-friedan|title=Publication of "The Feminine Mystique" by Betty Friedan - Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second-wave feminism was a period of feminist activity and thought that first began in the early 1960s in the United States, and eventually spread throughout the Western world and beyond. In the United States the movement lasted through the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Gamble, ed. ''The Routledge companion to feminism and postfeminism'' (2001) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Black feminism]] became popular in the 1960s, in response to the sexism of the civil rights movement and racism of the feminist movement. 
* [[Fat feminism]] originated in the late 1960s.
* 1969: [[Chicana feminism]], also called Xicanisma, is a sociopolitical movement in the United States that analyzes the historical, cultural, spiritual, educational, and economic intersections of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] women that identify as [[Chicano|Chicana]]. Chicana feminism challenges the stereotypes that Chicanas face across lines of gender, ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality. Most importantly, Chicana feminism serves as a movement that helps women to reclaim their existence between the Chicano and American feminist movements. The 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference began the [[Chicano movement]] and eventually, [[MEChA]]. At the conference, women began to get involved in the male-dominated dialogue to address feminist concerns. After the conference, women returned to their communities as activists and thus began the Chicana feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring the Chicana Feminist Movement|url=http://umich.edu/~ac213/student_projects07/latfem/latfem/whatisit.html|publisher=The University of Michigan|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1980s
* [[Difference feminism]] was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as "[[equality feminism]]"), which emphasizes the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it is still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasizes the differences between men and women and argues that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminism aims to make society and law gender-neutral, since it sees recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism holds that gender-neutrality harms women "whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Equity feminism]] (also stylized equity-feminism) is a form of [[liberal feminism]] discussed since the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social Feminism |first=Naomi |last=Black |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=kDYqAAAAYAAJ |date=1989 |publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Halfmann/&gt; specifically a kind of [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] feminism and [[libertarian]] feminism.&lt;ref name=Halfmann&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Q83kxhOsgxYC&amp;pg=PA79 |title=Industry and Politics in West Germany: Toward the Third Republic |editor-first=Peter J. |editor-last=Katzenstein |chapter=3.

; 1990s
* [[Third-wave feminism]] is associated with the emergence of [[riot grrrl]], the feminist [[punk subculture]], in the early 1990s in [[Olympia, Washington]].&lt;ref name=Piepmeier2009p45&gt;{{cite book|first=Alison|last=Piepmeier|title=Girl Zines: Making Media, Doing Feminism|location=New York|publisher=New York University Press|year=2009|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 [[Anita Hill]] testified in [[Washington, D.C.]] to an all-male, all-white [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] that [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]], nominated for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], had sexually harassed her. [[Rebecca Walker]] responded to Thomas's appointment with an article in ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'', "Becoming the Third Wave" (1992), which coined the term third wave: "Do not vote for them unless they work for us. Do not have sex with them, do not break bread with them, do not nurture them if they don't prioritize our freedom to control our bodies and our lives. I am not a post-feminism feminist.

'''Trait leadership''' is defined as integrated patterns of personal characteristics that reflect a range of individual differences and foster consistent leader effectiveness across a variety of group and organizational situations (Zaccaro, Kemp, &amp; Bader, 2004).&lt;ref name="Stephen J. Zaccaro"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen J.

Although this perspective has been criticized immensely over the past century, scholars still continue to study the effects of personality traits on leader effectiveness. Research has demonstrated that successful leaders differ from other people and possess certain core personality traits that significantly contribute to their success. Understanding the importance of these core personality traits that predict leader effectiveness can help organizations with their leader selection, training, and development practices (Derue et al., 2011).

== History of research ==
The emergence of the concept of trait leadership can be traced back to [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s [[Great Man theory|"great man" theory]], which stated that "The History of the World [...] was the Biography of Great Men."&lt;ref&gt;

Subsequent commentators interpreted this view to conclude that the forces of extraordinary leadership&lt;ref&gt;
Carlyle in [[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History|''On Heroes'']] did not use the word "leadership" in his discussion of the hero as divinity, as prophet, as poet, as priest, as man of letters, and as "king" ; he mentions "leader" and "leaders" only 6 times (once quite disparagingly) in that work.

shape history (Judge, Piccolo, &amp; Kosalka, 2009). Influenced by Carlyle, [[Francis Galton]] in ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) took this idea further. Galton found that leadership was a unique property of extraordinary individuals and suggested that the traits which leaders possessed were immutable and could not be developed. Throughout the early 1900s, the study of leadership focused on traits.  Cowley (1931) commented that the approach to the research of leadership has usually been and should always be through the study of traits (Cowley, 1931). Many theorists, influenced by Carlyle and Galton, believed that trait leadership depended on the personal qualities of the leader, however, they did not assume that leadership only resides within a select number of people (Judge, Bono, Ilies, &amp; Gerhardt, 2002). This trait perspective of leadership was widely accepted until the late 1940s and early 1950s, when researchers began to deem personality traits insufficient in predicting leader effectiveness (Stogdill, 1948; Mann, 1959).

In 1948, Stogdill stated that leadership exists between persons in a social situation, and that persons who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. This statement has been cited ubiquitously as sounding the death knell for trait-leadership theory. Furthermore, scholars commented that any trait's effect on leadership behavior will always depend on the situation (Huges, Ginnett, &amp; Curphy, 1996; Yukl &amp; Van Fleet, 1992).  Subsequently, leadership stopped being characterized by individual differences, and behavioral and situational analyses of leadership took over and began to dominate the field of leadership research (Bass, 1990). During this period of widespread rejection, several dominant theories took the place of trait leadership theory, including Fiedler's (1967) contingency model, Blake and Mouton's (1964) managerial grid, Hersey and Blanchard's (1969) situational leadership model, and transformational and transactional leadership models (Avolio, Sosik, Jung, &amp; Berson, 2003; Bass, 1985; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman, &amp; Fetter, 1990).

Despite the growing criticisms of trait leadership, the purported basis for the rejection of trait-leadership models began to encounter strong challenges (Kenny &amp; Zaccaro, 1983; Lord, DeVader, &amp; Alliger, 1986) in the 1980s. Zaccaro (2007) pointed out that even Stogdill's (1948) review, although cited as evidence against leader traits, contained conclusions supporting that individual differences could still be predictors of leader effectiveness. With an increasing number of empirical studies directly supporting trait leadership (Judge et al., 2002; Judge, Colbert, &amp; Ilies, 2004), traits have reemerged in the lexicon of the scientific research into leadership. In recent years, the research about leader traits has made some progress in identifying a list of personality traits that are highly predictive of leader effectiveness. Additionally, to account for the arguments for situational leadership, researchers have used the [[round-robin design methodology]] to test whether certain individuals emerge as leaders across multiple situations (Kenny &amp; Zaccaro, 1983). Scholars have also proposed new ways of studying the relationship of certain traits to leader effectiveness. For instance, many{{quantify|date=September 2014}} suggest the integration of trait and behavioral theories to understand how traits relate to leader effectiveness (Derue et al., 2011). Furthermore, scholars have expanded their focus and have proposed looking at more malleable traits (ones susceptible to development) in addition to the traditional dispositional traits as predictors of leader effectiveness (Hoffman, Woehr, Maldagen-Youngjohn, &amp; Lyons, 2011). Context is only now beginning to be examined as a contributor to leaders' success and failure. [[Productive narcissism|Productive narcissistic]] CEOs like [[Steven Jobs]] of Apple and [[Jack Welch]] of GE have demonstrated a gift for creating [[innovation]], whereas leaders with idealized traits prove more successful in more stable environments requiring less innovation and [[creativity]] (Maccoby, 2007).

Cultural fit and leadership value can be determined by evaluating an individual’s own behavior, perceptions of their employees and peers, and the direct objective results of their organization, and then comparing these findings against the needs of the company (Bass, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. and Riggio, R. E. (Eds.). (2006). Transformational Leadership (2nd ed). Mahwah,  NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leader traits ==
The investigations of leader traits are always by no means exhaustive (Zaccaro, 2007). In recent years, several studies have made comprehensive reviews about leader traits which have been historically studied (Derue et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2011; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007). There are many ways that traits related to leadership can be categorized; however, the two most recent categorizations have organized traits into (1) demographic vs. task competence vs. interpersonal and (2) distal (trait-like) vs. proximal (state-like): 

=== Demographic, task competence and interpersonal leadership ===
Based on a recent review of the trait leadership literature, Derue and others (2011) stated that most leader traits can be organized into three categories: demographic, task competence, and interpersonal attributes. For the demographics category, gender has by far received the most attention in terms of leadership; however, most scholars have found that male and female leaders are both equally effective. Task competence relates to how individuals approach the execution and performance of tasks (Bass &amp; Bass, 2008). Hoffman grouped intelligence, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and Emotional Stability into this category. Lastly, interpersonal attributes are related to how a leader approaches social interactions. According to Hoffman and others (2011), Extraversion and Agreeableness should be grouped into this category.

=== Distal (trait-like) vs. proximal (state-like) ===
Recent research has shifted from focusing solely on distal (dispositional/trait-like) characteristics of leaders to more proximal (malleable/state-like) individual differences often in the form of knowledge and skills (Hoffman et al., 2011). The hope is that emergence of proximal traits in trait leadership theory will help researchers answer the ancient question: are leaders born or made?  Proximal individual differences suggest that the characteristics that distinguish effective leaders from non-effective leaders are not necessarily stable through the life-span, implying that these traits may be able to be developed. Hoffman and others (2011) examined the effects of distal vs. proximal traits on leader effectiveness. He found that distal individual differences of achievement motivation, energy, flexibility, dominance, honesty/integrity, self-confidence, creativity, and charisma were strongly correlated with leader effectiveness. Additionally, he found that the proximal individual differences of interpersonal skills, oral communication, written communication, management skills, problem solving skills, and decision making were also strongly correlated with leader effectiveness. His results suggested that on average, distal and proximal individual differences have a similar relationship with effective leadership (Hoffman et al., 2011).

== Trait-leadership model ==
Zaccaro and colleagues (2004) created a model to understand leader traits and their influence on leader effectiveness/performance. This model, shown in the figure below, is based on other models of leader traits and leader effectiveness/performance (Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, Fleishman, &amp; Reiter-Palmon, 1993; Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al., 2000) and rests on two basic premises about leader traits. The first premise is that leadership emerges from the combined influence of multiple traits as opposed to emerging from the independent assessment of traits. Zaccaro (2001) argued that effective leadership is derived from an integrated set of cognitive abilities, social capabilities, and dispositional tendencies, with each set of traits adding to the influence of the other. The second premise is that leader traits differ in their proximal influence on leadership. This model is a multistage one in which certain distal attributes (i.e. dispositional attributes, cognitive abilities, and motives/values) serve as precursors for the development of proximal personal characteristics (i.e. social skills, problem solving skills and expertise knowledge) (Ackerman &amp; Humphreys, 1990; Barrick, Mitchell, &amp; Stewart, 2003; Chen, Gully, Whiteman, &amp; Kilcullen, 2000; Schneider, Hough, &amp; Dunnette, 1996; Kanfer, 1990, 1992; Mumford, Zaccaro, Harding, et al., 2000). Adopting this categorization approach and based on several comprehensive reviews/meta-analysis of trait leadership in recent years (Derue et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2010; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007), we tried to make an inclusive list of leader traits (Table 1). However, the investigations of leader traits are always by no means exhaustive (Zaccaro, 2007).

'''Table 1. Leader Traits based on Zaccaro’s (2004) Model'''
|-
| [[Extraversion]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; represents the tendency to be sociable, assertive, active, and to experience positive affects, such as energy and zeal. In Judge and other’s (2002) [[meta-analysis]], Extraversion was significantly positively related to leadership ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|r]] = .31).
|-
| [[Agreeableness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; refers to the tendency to be trusting, compliant, caring, and gentle. The relationship between Agreeableness and leadership is still ambiguous. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Agreeableness was not significantly related to leadership (r = .08).
|-
| [[Conscientiousness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; it comprises two related facets, namely achievement and dependability. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Conscientiousness was significantly positively related to leadership (r = .28).
|-
| [[Openness]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; the disposition to be imaginative, nonconforming, unconventional, and autonomous. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Openness was found to be significantly positively related with leadership (r = .24).
|-
| [[Neuroticism]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| One dimension of Big-Five Personality Model; represents the tendency to exhibit poor emotional adjustment and experience negative affects, such as anxiety, insecurity, and hostility. In Judge and other’s (2002) meta-analysis, Neuroticism was significantly negatively correlated with (r = -.24).
|-
| [[Honesty]]/[[integrity]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| Defined as the correspondence between work and deed, and as being truthful and non deceitful (Locke, 1991). In Hoffman and other’s (2011) meta analysis, honesty/integrity was found to be positively related to leadership effectiveness of others and surrounding factors(r = .29).
|-
| [[Charisma]] (Distal - Dispositional)|| Charismatic leaders are able to influence followers by articulating a compelling vision for the future, arousing commitment to organizational objectives and inspiring commitment and a sense of self-efficacy among followers. Hoffman and others (2011) found it has a significant influence on leadership (r = .57).
|-
| [[Intelligence]] (Distal - Cognitive Abilities)|| Intelligence is regarded as the most important trait in psychology. It has been identified as one of the most critical traits that must be possessed by all leaders (Judge et al., 2004).
|-
| [[Creativity]] (Distal - Cognitive Abilities)|| Creativity has been proposed as an important component of effective leadership; Hoffman and others (2011) found a significant relationship between creativity and leader effectiveness (r = .31).
|-
| Achievement motivation (Distal - Motive/Value)|| The motivation to achieve has been proved to have significant relationship with leader effectiveness (r = .23) (Judge et al., 2002).
|-
| [[Need for power]](Distal - Motive/Value)|| Characterized by the satisfaction leaders derive from exerting influence over the attitudes and behaviors of others. Need for power has a positive relationship with leader effectiveness (McClelland &amp; Boyatzis, 1982).
|-
| Oral/written communication (Proximal - Social Skills)|| Oral and written communication skills are found to be significantly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| [[Interpersonal skills]] (Proximal - Social Skills)|| Including a broad range of skills associated with un understanding of human behavior and the dynamics of groups (Locke, 1991; Yukl, 2006), interpersonal skills were found to be significantly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| General [[problem solving]] (Proximal - Problem Solving)|| General problem solving skills were found to be one of the factors most strongly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| [[Decision making]] (Proximal - Problem Solving)|| Decision skills were also found to be one of the factors most strongly correlated with leader effectiveness (Hoffman et al., 2011).
|-
| Technical knowledge (Proximal - Expertise Knowledge)|| Technical knowledge includes methods, processes, and equipment for conducting the specialized activities of the managers’ organizational unit (Yukl, 2006). It has been proved to be positively correlated with leader effectiveness (Bass, 1990).
|-
| [[Management]] skills (Proximal - Expertise Knowledge)|| Given that leaders’ key responsibilities involve coordinating the work of multiple constituents, the ability to manage is likely crucial to leader effectiveness. This relationship has also been proved significant (Hoffman et al., 2011).

== Other models of trait leadership ==
Multiple models have been proposed to explain the relationship of traits to leader effectiveness.  Recently, integrated trait leadership models were put forward by summarizing the historical findings and reconciling the conflict between traits and other factors such as situations in determining effective leadership (Derue et al., 2011; Judge et al., 2009; Zaccaro, 2007). In addition to Zaccaro’s Model of Leader Attributes and Leader Performance described in the previous section, two other models have emerged in recent trait leadership literature. The Leader Trait Emergence Effectiveness (LTEE) Model, created by Judge and colleagues (2009), combines the behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology theories of how personality traits are developed into a model that explains leader emergence and effectiveness. Additionally, this model separates objective and subjective leader effectiveness into different criterion. The authors created this model to be broad and flexible as to diverge from how the relationship between traits and leadership had been studied in past research. Another model that has emerged in the trait leadership literature is the Integrated Model of Leader Traits, Behaviors, and Effectiveness (Derue et al., 2011). This model combines traits and behaviors in predicting leader effectiveness and tested the mediation effect of leader behaviors on the relationship between leader traits and effectiveness. The authors found that some types of leader behaviors mediated the effect between traits and leader effectiveness. The results of Derue and colleagues' (2011) study supported an integrated trait-behavioral model that can be used in future research.

== Criticisms of trait leadership ==
Although there has been an increased focus by researchers on trait leadership, this theory remains one of the most criticized theories of leadership. Over the years, many reviewers of trait leadership theory have commented that this approach to leadership is “too simplistic” (Conger &amp; Kanugo, 1998), and “futile” (House &amp; Aditya, 1997). Additionally, scholars have noted that trait leadership theory usually only focuses on how leader effectiveness is perceived by followers (Lord et al., 1986) rather than a leader’s actual effectiveness (Judge et al., 2009). Because the process through which personality predicts the actual effectiveness of leaders has been relatively unexplored (Ng, Ang, &amp; Chan, 2008), these scholars have concluded that personality currently has low explanatory and predictive power over job performance and cannot help organizations select leaders who will be effective (Morgeson &amp; Ilies, 2007). Furthermore, Derue and colleagues (2011) found that leader behaviors are more predictive of leader effectiveness than are traits.

Another criticism of trait leadership is its silence on the influence of the situational context surrounding leaders (Ng et al., 2008). Stogdill (1948) found that persons who are leaders in one situation may not be leaders in another situation. Complimenting this situational theory of leadership, Murphy (1941) wrote that leadership does not reside in the person, and it usually requires examining the whole situation. In addition to situational leadership theory, there has been growing support for other leadership theories such as transformational, transactional, charismatic, and authentic leadership theories. These theories have gained popularity because they are more normative than the trait and behavioral leadership theories (Schaubroeck, Lam, &amp; Cha, 2007).

Further criticisms include the failure of studies to uncover a trait or group of traits that are consistently associated with leadership emergence or help differentiate leaders from followers (Kenny &amp; Zacarro, 1983). Additionally, trait leadership’s focus on a small set of personality traits and neglect of more malleable traits such as social skills and problem solving skills has received considerable criticism.  Lastly, trait leadership often fails to consider the integration of multiple traits when studying the effects of traits on leader effectiveness (Zaccaro, 2007).

== Implications for practice ==
Given the recent increase in evidence and support of trait leadership theory (Ng et al., 2008), scholars have suggested a variety of strategies for human resource departments within organizations.  Companies should use personality traits as selection tools for identifying emerging leaders (Ng et al., 2008). These companies, however, should be aware of the individual traits that predict success in leader effectiveness as well as the traits that could be detrimental to leader effectiveness. For example, while Derue and colleagues (2011) found that individuals who are high in Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness are predicted to be more likely to be perceived as successful in leadership positions, Judge, Woolf, Hurst, &amp; Livingston (2006) wrote that individuals who are high in narcissism are more likely to be a liability in certain jobs. Narcissism is just one example of a personality trait that should be explored further by HR practitioners to ensure they are not placing individuals with certain traits in the wrong positions.

Complementing the suggestion that personality traits should be used as selection tools, Judge and colleagues (2002) found that the Big Five Personality traits were more strongly related to leadership than intelligence. This finding suggests that selecting leaders based on their personality is more important than selecting them based on intelligence. If organizations select leaders based on intelligence, it is recommended by Judge and colleagues (2002) that these individuals be placed in leadership positions when the stress level is low and the individual has the ability to be directive.

Another way in which HR practitioners can use the research on trait leadership is for leadership development programs. Although inherent personality traits (distal/trait-like) are relatively immune to leadership development, Zaccaro (2007) suggested that proximal traits (state-like) will be more malleable and susceptible to leadership development programs. Companies should use different types of development interventions to stretch the existing capabilities of their leaders (Zaccaro, 2007).

There is also evidence to suggest that Americans have an Extrovert Ideal, which dictates that people, most times unconsciously, favor the traits of extroverted individuals and suppress the qualities unique to introverts (Cain, 2012). Susan Cain's research points to a transition sometime around the turn of the century during which we stopped evaluating our leaders based on character and began judging them instead based on personality. While both extroverted and introverted leaders have been shown to be effective, we have a general proclivity towards extroverted traits, which when evaluating trait leadership, could skew our perception of what's important.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48069">{{United States Crime Rates By City}}
The following table is based on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[Uniform Crime Reports]] statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010|publisher=[[FBI]]|title=Crime in the United States by Metropolitan Statistical Area, 2010 (Table 6)|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population numbers are based on [[U.S. Census]] estimates for the year end.  The number of murders includes [[nonnegligent manslaughter]].  This list is based on the reporting agency.  In most cases the city and the reporting agency are identical.  However, in some cases such as Charlotte, Honolulu and Las Vegas, the reporting agency as more than one city.

Murder is the only statistic that all agencies are required to report.  Consequently, some agencies particularly in Illinois do not report all the crimes.  If components are missing the total is adjusted to "0."

==Note about population==
Data is voluntarily submitted by each jurisdiction and some jurisdictions do not appear in the table because they either did not submit data or it did not meet deadlines.

According to the FBI website has this disclaimer on population estimates:

:For the 2007 population estimates used in this table, the FBI computed individual rates of growth from one year to the next for every city/town and county using 2000 decennial population counts and 2001 through 2006 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. Each agency's rates of growth were averaged; that average was then applied and added to its 2006 Census population estimate to derive the agency's 2007 population estimate  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2007/data/table_08_dd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of ranking crime data ==
The FBI web site recommends against using its data for ranking because these rankings lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting cities and counties, along with their residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/caution-against-ranking |title=Caution Against Ranking|publisher=[[FBI]]|accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI web site also recommends against using its data to judge how effective law enforcement agencies are, since there are many factors that influence [[crime rate]]s other than law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/word.htm|title=A Word About UCR Data|publisher=[[FBI]]|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, the executive board of the [[American Society of Criminology]] (ASC) went further than the FBI itself, and approved a resolution opposing not only the use of the ratings to judge police departments, but also opposing any development of city crime rankings from FBI Uniform Crime Reports (UCRs) at all. The resolution opposed these rankings on the grounds that they "fail to account for the many conditions affecting crime rates" and "divert attention from the individual and community characteristics that elevate crime in all cities", though it did not provide sources or further elaborate on these claims. The resolution states the rankings "represent an irresponsible misuse of the data and do groundless harm to many communities" and "work against a key goal of our society, which is a better understanding of crime-related issues by both scientists and the public".&lt;ref name=ASOC&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/11-16-2007/0004707515&amp;EDATE= Criminologists Condemn City crime rankings] (November 16, 2008).''PRNewswire''. Retrieved on January 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Conference of Mayors]] passed a similar statement, which also committed the Conference to working with the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice "to educate reporters, elected officials, and citizens on what the (UCR) data means and doesn't mean."&lt;ref name="ASOC"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9152">The '''Urban Traffic Management Control ''' or '''UTMC programme''' is the main initiative in the UK for the development of a more open approach to [[Intelligent Transport Systems]] or [[Intelligent Transport Systems|ITS]] in [[urban area]]s. Originating as a Government research programme, the initiative is now managed by a community forum, the UTMC Development Group, which represents both local transport authorities and the systems industry.

UTMC systems are designed to allow the different applications used within modern traffic management systems to communicate and share information with each other. This allows previously disparate data from multiple sources such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition ([[ANPR]]) cameras, [[Variable-message signs|Variable Message Signs]] (VMS), car parks, traffic signals, air quality monitoring stations and meteorological data, to be amalgamated into a central console or database. The idea behind UTMC is to maximise road network potential to create a more robust and intelligent system that can be used to meet current and future management requirements.

==Background and history==

The UTMC was launched in 1997 by the UK Government's Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions (now the [[Department for Transport]]  ('''DfT''')). During the first three years, a number of research projects were undertaken to establish and validate an approach based on modular systems and open standards. These have contributed to the UTMC Technical Specifications, which define UTMC [[Technical standard|standards]].

* To assist local authorities in gaining the most from [[Intelligent transportation system]] and to achieve their transport objectives, the [[Department for Transport]] initiated the six-year, £6M UTMC programme in 1997. The first half of the UTMC programme (1997–2000) concentrated on specific applied research tasks, on both technical and operational issues.
* In January 2001, the programme embarked on a demonstrator phase to consolidate the results of the earlier research. Full scale demonstrator projects taking a pragmatic UTMC approach were run in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] with key systems provided by [[Mott MacDonald]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] using [[Siemens]] and [[York]] with systems from Tenet Technology (these systems are now owned and marketed by [[Dynniq]]).
* Early in 2003, the UTMC Development Group (UDG) was set up, as a group of [[local authorities]] and suppliers, with the support of the DfT, to oversee the future development of UTMC. This has managed the  initiative continuously since 2004.

UTMC has helped local authorities achieve their goals by adopting an appropriate, but not over constraining, set of standards to allow users, suppliers and integrators of UTMC systems to plan and supply systems cost-effectively in an open market. These standards are essential in breaking boundaries and local authority borders to allow network interoperability.

== UTMC Activities ==

===Specifications and Standards===
The UTMC Specifications and Standards Group (S&amp;SG) is responsible for ensuring that the UTMC technical framework continues to meet local authorities' needs, currently and in the future. The S&amp;SG oversees the maintenance and upkeep of the UTMC Technical Specifications. Its members are drawn from both local authorities and the supplier community, but it is always led by local authorities.

The S&amp;SG works closely with the full range of UTMC suppliers to ensure its requirements are technically achievable. It operates a transparent consultation regime on all technical changes. From time to time it may commission and fund technical research and standards development activities, though it operates principally through coordinating the input freely provided by suppliers and users.

The Specification provides standards for shared data (i.e. data communicated between applications of a UTMC system, or between a UTMC system and an external system) through:

*holding definitions of current UTMC Objects, and making them available to users;
*receiving submissions for potential new UTMC Objects, and coordinating consultation as necessary;
*facilitating contact between Object developers;
*advising on changes needed to potential new UTMC Objects;
*registering new UTMC Objects.

As well as undertaking technical work to develop national specifications, there are a number of activities that help "market" the initiative to the traffic management community. There is a conference, usually held annually, papers and articles are published in key industry journals and regular workshops are held focusing on key (technical or operational) themes. In 2006, the UTMC community ran a number of special sessions at the ITS World Congress held in London, as well as running a village of suppliers demonstrating UTMC-compatible products.

The UTMC initiative formerly published a Products Catalogue, representing products submitted as compliant by suppliers. This was discontinued in December 2014.

==UTMC specification documents==
The following documents are maintained and published for open use on the UTMC website.

* The '''UTMC Framework Technical Specification''' TS003 presents the core technical standards recommended for use by Traffic Managers in their systems.
* The '''UTMC Objects Registry''' TS004 presents a standardised set of data structures associated with traffic management, in several forms including UML data model, XML schema, SNMP MIBs, some IDL scripts for CORBA based systems, and tabular representation (originally designed for database designers).

The current issue of the Technical Specification is available for free download on the UTMC resources website [http://www.utmc.eu/utmc-specifications].

==Examples of UTMC in action==
Local authorities with UTMC have more control over their road network. Some examples of what they can do are:

'''Advise'''&lt;br /&gt;
By monitoring how long it takes a vehicle to pass two ANPR cameras and then dividing the time by the distance between the cameras, an average speed can be measured and used to inform motorists via VMS how long it will take them to reach a destination, or to set diversions.
Example by Envitia: VMS in Aberdeen [http://www.envitia.com/news/newsdetails.aspx?id=369,0,0]. Example by IDT: Journey time monitoring in Birmingham [https://www.idtuk.com/downloads/Case_studies_6a.pdf]

'''Warn'''&lt;br /&gt;
Wind detectors attached to a bridge give drivers of high sided vehicles warnings before they cross. The warning messages are displayed on VMS signs activated when wind speed thresholds are exceeded.
Example by Siemens: Bridge VMSs offer wind warnings [http://www.traffictechnologytoday.com/news.php?NewsID=5228].

'''Guide'''&lt;br /&gt;
By linking parking guidance systems to a common database traffic control room operators can inform motorists via strategic VMS  about the current state of car parks; especially useful for special events like carnivals when normal use is exceeded.
Example by Mott MacDonald: Car Park Guidance in Edinburgh [http://www.cdmf.info/client_edin.htm]

Previously these systems would have been impracticable due to the sheer volumes of data processing and the operator time needed to apply constant manual updates.

==Joint Chairs’ Group (JCG)==
The JCG was created in 2004 to bring together the UDG with other key ITS community organisations; it was later expanded to include representation from the [[Department for Transport]] and the [[Highways Agency]]. The JCG's aim was to ensure that the strategic direction of the various groups and bodies involved in UK ITS was kept aligned.

The JCG was suspended in September 2012, as the prevailing financial conditions had reduced the resource available to its participants.

==UTMC links with international standards==
UTMC builds on a base of mainstream [[Internet protocol suite|internet protocols]], and focusses on defining data structures suitable for exchange between ITS systems and devices. At the time of its origination there were few available international standards to build on, and the research was therefore used to generate many of its own standards. However for exchange between central systems (for example, B2B data exchange between neighbouring roads authorities), UTMC refers to the specifications of the European project DATEX.

DATEX (as [[Datex II]]) is now being standardized through the European standards agency [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] and UTMC has been involved in a number of European standards-related projects, notably POSSE (Promotion of Open Specifications and Standards in Europe). There is a current workstream within UTMC aiming to align the UTMC Technical Specification more closely with Datex II.

'''JAND, Inc.''', [[doing business as]] '''Warby Parker''', is an American [[online retailer]] of [[prescription glasses]] and [[sunglasses]], based in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Vogue"&gt;{{Citation|last=Bahrenburg|first=Genevieve|title=In Focus: Warby Parker Eyewear|date=February 22, 2010|url=http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/vd-in-focus-warby-parker-eyewear/#1|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warby Parker primarily sells products through their website, but also feature retail locations in the U.S. and Canada.

== History ==
The company was founded in 2010 in [[Philadelphia]] by Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, David Gilboa, and Jeffrey Raider,&lt;ref name="Vogue" /&gt; and is headquartered in [[New York City]]. The name "Warby Parker" derives from two characters that appear in a journal by author [[Jack Kerouac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444097904577535111565440718 |title=Warby Parker Co-Founder Says Initial Vision Was All About Price |date=July 18, 2012 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's official corporate name is JAND Inc. and "Warby Parker" is the company's [[trade name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://opticalowl.com/how-warby-parker-name-warby-parker/ |title=How did Warby Parker get the name "Warby Parker?" – OpticalOwl |website=OpticalOwl.com |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was started in the Venture Initiation Program of the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], where the founders all studied.&lt;ref name="Corbyn"&gt;{{cite web |last=Corbyn |first=Zoë |title=Take one start-up, add expertise and grow with care |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/59f43594-c774-11e1-85fc-00144feab49a.html |date=September 24, 2012 |work=[[The Financial Times]] |accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company received $2,500 seed investment through the program and launched in February 2010.&lt;ref name="Corbyn"/&gt; Shortly after launching, the company was covered by [[Vogue.com]].&lt;ref name="Vogue"/&gt; In May 2011, Warby Parker raised its first round of funding totaling $2.5 million.

In 2016, the company announced plans to create an optical lab in [[Rockland County, New York]] to create and manufacture their glasses in-house instead of paying external manufacturers. The space would be a 34,000-square-foot and would employ 130 staff. The company would be investing $16 million to create the production facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/4011943/warby-parker-is-opening-an-enormous-new-optical-lab-in-rockland-county |title=Warby Parker is opening an enormous new optical lab in Rockland County |date=June 27, 2016 |work=Fast Company|access-date=January 9, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The optical lab was opened in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/06/warby-parkers-optical-lab-manufactures-a-new-eyewear-shopping-model.html |title=Sloatsburg, NY, town of around 3,000, offers a peek at the future of eyeglasses |last=Juang |first=Mike |date=June 6, 2017 |work=CNBC|access-date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retail model ==
The company primarily sells eyewear [[e-commerce|online]] and through its multiple locations throughout the United States and Canada. Warby Parker's "Home-Try-On program" allows customers to choose five frames from the website, which they receive to try on at home for five days, free of charge. Customers can also upload a photo and try on frames virtually.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mitroff|first=Sarah|title=With $37M, Warby Parker Sets Its Sights on More Than Just Eyeglasses|date=September 12, 2012|url=https://www.wired.com/business/2012/09/warby-parker/|work=[[Wired.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warby Parker began operating online exclusively in 2010 and opened its first store in 2013. As Warby Parker’s revenue started to grow, the company began opening brick-and-mortar showrooms across the country to build its brand. It also expanded in 2015 with the brand’s first national retail partnership with Nordstrom, which allowed the company to establish six precisely curated "pop-up" shops nationwide. The brand has been keen on partnerships and pop-ups ever since. As of 2017, Warby Parker operates around 71 locations in 28 U.S. states and [[Washington, D.C.]], according to Slice Intelligence, Washington DC is only the 21st largest market in the U.S., but has three Warby Parker stores, making it Warby Parker's fourth largest market &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://intelligence.slice.com/blog/2018/does-brick-and-mortar-add-substance-to-warby-parker-sales-the-data-says-no|title=Warby Parker’s pricing strategy has buyers seeing double|work=Rakuten Intelligence|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, along with two stores in [[Toronto]]. According to CNBC, due to steady growth and the success of the physical storefronts, the company plans to operate nearly 100 stores across the U.S. by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/15/as-warby-parker-approaches-100-stores-other-internet-brands-follow.html|title=Warby Parker will soon operate nearly 100 stores and other Web retailers are following its lead|last=Thomas|first=Lauren|date=2018-02-15|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the opening of its [[retail]] stores, the company announced the company's intention to build its own [[point of sale]] (POS) system. One feature planned for the system is to charge the customer when their product is shipped, instead of when it is first ordered in-store.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Del Ray, Jason |url=http://allthingsd.com/20130624/an-unlikely-startup-enters-the-point-of-sale-business-warby-parker/ |title=An Unlikely Startup Enters the Point-of-Sale Business: Warby Parker |work=All Things D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of their stores focuses on a unique experience, for example, the Miami location is [https://fashionista.com/2017/04/warby-parker-west-hollywood-store “designed to look like you're inside a pool,”] the store is equipped with an overhead camera that allows the customer take photos and to try on the merchandise while it simulates the appearance of lounging at a pool. Another example of the company’s in-store experiences provided for consumers is their “green room” at the Melrose Avenue location, which is the brand's fourth store in Los Angeles. This location features a green screen photo booth where customers can record their own video with props and try on glasses. The brand also utilizes social media interaction with customers with custom hashtags. Specifically, at the most recent store event, there was a location-specific Snapchat filter which both promotes the event and adds a sense of exclusivity for consumers who attended the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fashionista.com/2017/04/warby-parker-west-hollywood-store|title=Warby Parker Launches Its Biggest Store Experience Yet|work=Fashionista|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By creating unique, entertaining and social media-friendly in-store "experiences," the brand can increase profitability and consumer-awareness.

== Products ==
Warby Parker designs their product in-house, and sell directly to consumers through their website, stores, and interactive showrooms. Most importantly, they order their own materials such as acetate from Italy and then manufacture frames at the same Chinese factories as their high-end competitors, like Luxottica. This manufacturing process enables Warby Parker to keep costs low, at less than $100 for lensed glasses, prices go as low as $95.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://disruptionmag.com/2016/05/17/dave-gilboa-warby-parker/|title=Why 4 B-School Students Decided To Found Warby Parker|date=2016-05-17|work=Disruption|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand offers a line of eyewear at $95, $145, and the highest at $195 per pair. Warby Parker’s pricing strategy drives consumers to purchase more than one pair. On average the Warby Parker consumer completes more than one order per year and buys an average of 1.5 units per order; this brand loyalty resonates highest with buyers between the ages of 25-34.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to eyeglasses and sunglasses, Warby Parker sells [[monocle]]s, which are available with prescription lenses.&lt;ref name="adage"&gt;{{Citation|last=Redick|first=Scott.|title=When Big Ideas Come From Small Companies|date=May 16, 2012|url=http://adage.com/article/small-agency-diary/big-ideas-small-companies/234741/|work=[[AdAge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders of the company have made it clear Warby Parker sees itself as a fashion brand first. The company's frames have been featured and well received in fashion magazines such as ''[[Elle (magazine)|ELLE]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Levinson|first=Lauren|title=Sophia Bush Poses for Warby Parker x Pencilse of Promise|date=October 15, 2012|url=http://www.elle.com/news/fashion-accessories/sophia-bush-for-warby-parker-pencils-of-promise|work=Elle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Soller|first=Kurt|title=Exclusive: Warby Parker Launching Prescription Shades|date=April 20, 2012|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/mens-fashion/warby-parker-prescription-shades-042012|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'',&lt;ref name="Vogue" /&gt; and ''[[GQ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sebra|first=Matthew|title=Exclusive First Look: Warby Parker's Hayworth Collection|date=February 12, 2013|url=https://www.gq.com/style/blogs/the-gq-eye/2013/02/exclusive-first-look-warby-parkers-hayworth-collection.html|work=GQ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to co-founder, Dave Gilboa, it is the brand's idea that glasses should be an accessory the same way shoes or bags are accessories, he continues to explain that: “You should own multiple pairs and that they should fit them to your mood or your style. After all, they’re the only thing you wear on your face. What could be more expressive than that?” By lowering prices from an average of $500 for prescription glasses to $100 per frame, Warby Parker enables you to express yourself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Donation program ==
Warby Parker uses a "buy one, give one" model, where for each pair of glasses purchased, the company pays for the production of another pair of eyeglasses for the [[non-profit organization]] [[VisionSpring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/242437 |title=For Warby Parker, Free Glasses Equals Clear Company Vision |last=Fitzgerald |first=Michael |date=February 10, 2015 |work=Entrepreneur|access-date=January 5, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; VisionSpring in turn sells the glasses to consumers or companies in [[developing countries]] as a way to encourage [[entrepreneurship]]. According to the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', this model provides positive [[marketing]] for the company, and the use of VisionSpring as an intermediary company may address some of the criticisms that have been leveled at [[Toms Shoes]], which uses a similar model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gerber |first1=Monica |title=Warby Parker may have a better 'buy one, give one' model |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Making-a-difference/Change-Agent/2011/1222/Warby-Parker-may-have-a-better-buy-one-give-one-model |accessdate=June 2, 2016 |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, Warby Parker announced that it had distributed 1,000,000 pairs of eyeglasses to people in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Chokkattu |first=Julian |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/warby-parker-hits-one-million-glasses-sold-distributed/ |title=Warby Parker Hits One Million Glasses Sold, Distributed |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also claims to be 100% [[carbon neutral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zelman |first=Josh |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/24/founder-stories-warby-parker-less-than-1-of-eyeglasses-were-sold-online/ |title=In Focus: Warby Parker Eyewear |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3522">The '''Western Australian Naturalists' Club''' (WANC), founded in [[Perth, Western Australia]], in 1924, is one of the oldest [[Conservation movement|conservation]] groups in Australia.  It caters for those interested in all areas of [[natural history]] and conservation in Western Australia through a full program of excursions, meetings, workshops and social events.

==History==
The inaugural meeting of the club was held on 3 July 1924 under the direction of three scientists, [[botanist]] W.M. Carne, [[entomology|entomologist]] J. Clark and [[ornithology|ornithologist]] [[Dominic Serventy]].  
From early in its existence it held annual exhibitions in the [[Perth Town Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58389301 |title=W.A. NATURALISTS' CLUB. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|Sunday Times]] |location=Perth |date=27 October 1929 |accessdate=1 April 2012 |page=2 Section: The Sunday Times. |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article75485617 |title=NATURALISTS' CLUB. |newspaper=[[The Mirror (Western Australia)|The Mirror]] |location=Perth, WA |date=4 October 1930 |accessdate=1 April 2012 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58650331 |title=NATURALISTS' EXHIBITION. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|Sunday Times]] |location=Perth |date=25 October 1931 |accessdate=1 April 2012 |page=18 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article78264193 |title=14ft Grass For Exhibition. |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]] |location=Perth |date=7 September 1946 |accessdate=1 April 2012 |page=7 Edition: FIRST EDITION |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It adopted a constitution in 1936, revised when the club became incorporated in 1979.  Its journal, ''The Western Australian Naturalist'', was first published in 1947.  Most regular meetings were held at the [[Western Australian Museum]] until 1962 when the club obtained its own premises in [[Nedlands, Western Australia|Nedlands]], a hall which was replaced 1n 1997 by a library and office in [[Northbridge, Western Australia|Northbridge]], with monthly meetings held at the [[University of Western Australia]].  The club also owns a field station at [[South Yunderup, Western Australia|Yunderup]], 100&amp;nbsp;km south of Perth.

==Publications==
Members receive a refereed [[scientific journal]], ''[[The Western Australian Naturalist]]'', twice a year, as well as monthly newsletters.  The club has also published a series of natural history handbooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8764">'''William Lawton Wolfe''' (February 17, 1951 – May 17, 1974) was one of the founding members of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA). While in the group, he adopted the name "Kahjoh", though the media misspelled as "Cujo".

==Early life==

Wolfe was raised in [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="daysrage"&gt;Burrough, Bryan, [https://www.amazon.com/Days-Rage-Underground-Forgotten-Revolutionary/dp/1594204292 "Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence"], Penguin, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Dr L.S. Wolfe Jr, a prominent anesthesiologist.&lt;ref name="peopleman"&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20064189,00.html "The Man Patty Hearst Loved"], People, June 24, 1974,&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced when he was 15. Wolfe boarded at [[Northfield Mount Hermon School]], a [[Massachusetts]] prep school, but his father said he did not thrive there. After graduating from Mount Hermon, Willie chose to delay college, and took a year-long trek to the Arctic Circle. "He asked me for $200 when he left," his father recalled with pride, "and that kid came back with $60 change."&lt;ref name="peopleman"/&gt;

==Move to California and political involvement==

In 1971 he moved to San Francisco, where he enrolled in the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and studied [[anthropology]]. One of the classes he took was African-American Linguistics through the [http://africam.berkeley.edu/ Department of Afro-American Studies], and taught by [[Colston Westbrook]].&lt;ref name="brussell"/&gt; Through this class, Wolfe became involved in prisoners' rights. A small group of Berkeley students became involved in the [[Venceremos (political organization)|Venceremos]] prison outreach project and started visiting the prisons to discuss politics and social justice issues with the prisoners, particularly at [[California Medical Facility|Vacaville prison]]. In 1972, prisoner [[Donald DeFreeze]] (Cinque), invited Wolfe and [[Russ Little (SLA)|Russ Little]] to join his separate study group, Unisight. A former [[The Black Panthers|Black Panther]], an inmate by the name of [[Thero Wheeler]], was also in the clique.&lt;ref name=peoplemystery&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Vin-McLellan/e/B001KDNH2E|Vin McLellan], [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20063998,00.html "The Man and the Mystery Behind the SLA Terror"], People, April 29, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Robert Stone (director)|Robert Stone's]] 2005 documentary, [[Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst]], Russ Little said of Willie:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's funny how these things happen, but that's where [Little's political film nights] we met [[William Harris (SLA)|Bill]], [[Emily Harris (SLA)|Emily]] and [[Joe Remiro|Joe]], was at one of these films. Willie was kind of like the catalyst. Willie was the one that all these different people met. Willie was like the common denominator. Willie studied anthropology at Berkeley, and it was actually through Berkeley that he got into going to prisons. Through some class, some anthropology class.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Willie dropped out of college in 1972 as he became more involved in radical activism.

==Private investigation by Willie's father==
When Willie's father, Dr Wolfe, learned of his son's involvement in the SLA, he hired private detective [[Lake Headley]] to provide him with more information. On May 4, 1974, thirteen days before the younger Wolfe's death in a shootout and fire, Headley concluded his investigation and filed a sworn affidavit of his findings. These included:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That Patricia Campbell Hearst and her parents disagreed bitterly over Patricia's political and personal relations. That a love affair between a black man and Patricia Hearst did take place prior to her relationship with her fiancé Steven Weed. That Mrs. Randolph A. Hearst subjected her daughter to extreme pressure to change her personal and political relationships.&lt;ref&gt;http://xdell.blogspot.com.au/2006/05/mary-alice-doesnt-lay-here-anymore.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On May 4, 1974, Headley, along with freelance writer [[Donald Freed]], held a press conference in San Francisco. They presented 400 pages of documentation of their findings, some of which included:
* a year before the kidnapping Patty Hearst had visited black convict [[Donald DeFreeze]], who later became the [[Symbionese Liberation Army|SLA]]'s figurehead.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co"&gt;Langley, W, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3555121/Patty-Hearst-urban-guerrilla-brought-to-heel.html "Patty Hearst - urban guerrilla brought to heel"], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]], 17 Feb, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* DeFreeze's arrest records;&lt;ref name="nytkifner"/&gt;
* the work of [[Colston Westbrook]] with [[Los Angeles Police Department]]'s CCS (Criminal Conspiracy Section) and the State of California's Sacramento-based CII (Criminal Identification and Investigation) unit.;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Ward &amp; Vander Wall, Jim, "[[Agents of Repression]]: The FBI's secret wars against the Black Panther Party", 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and
* evidence of links of the [[CIA]] to Police Departments.&lt;ref name="brussell"&gt;Brussell, Mae http://www.maebrussell.com/Mae%20Brussell%20Articles/Why%20Was%20Hearst%20Kidnapped%201.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Dick, "Who Ran the Sla?", Argosy, Ann Arbor Sun, January 22, 1976, http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/node/200649&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 1974, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran the story of [[Donald DeFreeze|DeFreeze]] and the [[Los Angeles Police Department]].&lt;ref name="nytkifner"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kifner |first=John |authorlink=John Kifner |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/17/archives/cinque-a-dropout-who-has-been-in-constant-trouble-school-dropout-on.html |title=Cinque: A Dropout Who Has Been in Constant Trouble; School Dropout On Welfare Wanted to Sell Bombs Recommendation Ignored Cooperation Indicated Charges Dropped |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 17, 1974 |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story was largely overlooked due to this being the day of the shootout and conflagration that killed DeFreeze and five other members of the SLA.

In a book [[Lake Headley]] co-wrote with freelance writer William Hoffman, ''Vegas P.I.: The Life and Times of America's Greatest Detective'', he presented well-documented evidence that Donald DeFreeze was a [[police informant]] and an [[agent provocateur]].&lt;ref name="headley"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Vegas-P-I-Americas-Greatest-Detective/dp/1560250577 "Vegas P.I.: The Life and Times of America's Greatest Detective], Thunder's Mouth, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Wolfe was burned to death after a gunfight with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] and an ensuing house fire in south-central Los Angeles. His charred remains were found in the crawl space of the house, along with those of [[Donald DeFreeze|DeFreeze]] and [[Mizmoon]], their gas masks melted to their faces. Wolfe, who was not wearing a gas mask, had died from smoke inhalation during the fire, and was the first fatality during the shootout.&lt;ref name="daysrage"/&gt;

Not long after, [[Patty Hearst]] released another of the group's tape recordings. On it, she said of him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cujo was the gentlest, most beautiful man I've ever known. We loved each other so much, and his love for people was so deep that he was willing to give his life for them.&lt;ref name="Brunner"&gt;Richard K. Brunner, [http://articles.mcall.com/2002-02-10/opinion/3395448_1_patty-tania-hearst-sla-william-randolph-hearst "News of old revolutionaries reopens heartbreak"], The Morning Call, February 10, 2002,&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Cujo nor I had ever loved an individual the way we loved each other. Probably this was because our relationship wasn't based on bourgeois ... values."&lt;ref name=peoplemystery/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Hearst was captured and charged, she alleged that Willie, along with others, had raped her in the early days of her kidnapping.

After the conflagration in LA, three FBI agents knocked on the door of Willie's father, Dr. Wolfe, at midnight. Although they could not confirm if Willie had been in the house at the time of the siege, they asked for Willie's dental records. Two days later, Dr. Wolfe got a call from the Los Angeles County Coroner's office telling him that his son was dead.&lt;ref name="Brunner"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
Stephen King gave Wolfe's nickname of ''Cujo'' to the title character (a mad dog) of the novel ''[[Cujo]]''.

The '''Zia''' are a tribe of about 4,000 people living in the lower [[Waria Valley]] in [[Morobe Province]], [[Papua New Guinea]].  The Zia tribe is divided into four clans, Bego (''hornbill''), Sakia (''white cockatoo''), Wapo ''(eagle)'' and Yewa ''(bird of paradise)'', each animal the clan's symbol.  Each clan also carries specific responsibilities to the tribe at large, in part through the maintenance of specialized field of knowledge.  The clans are matrilineal, with children inheriting their mother's clan membership and disallowing marriage between two members of the same clan.

Tribe decisions are made by chiefs representing the four clans and as such, require a majority of represented support to proceed.

The Zia tribal area covers the lower reaches of the Waria river, and extends along the Solomon Sea north and south of the river mouth.  Communities include Zare, Ainse, Siu, Popoe, Dona, Saigara, Pema, Siu, Bau and Eu.

Only the communities of Eu, Pema and Zare have schools with instruction above the third year.  There is also a school (with dorms) at Toyare, at the mouth of Waria river.   Because of the distance involved, parents who wish to send their children to higher grades must send their children to live in other communities for extended periods of time.  The cost is quite expensive—for many families, prohibitively so.

Upper level students in the Waria valley have two high school options.  The first is a technical high school located near Toyare.  The nearest traditional high school is four hours away north along the coast by boat.

The region's current Minister in Parliament is Sasa Zibe,&lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt; who is from the area.

Since 2001, groups of English teachers from Japan have been traveling to the area to carry out educational charity work, as part of both the Niigata International Charity Organization and the Niigata-PNG Association.
