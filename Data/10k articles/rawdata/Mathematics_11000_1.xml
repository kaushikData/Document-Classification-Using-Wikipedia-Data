'''102''' ('''one hundred [and] two''') is the [[natural number]] following [[101 (number)|101]] and preceding [[103 (number)|103]].

==In mathematics==
102 is an [[abundant number]] and [[semiperfect number]]. It is a [[sphenic number]]. It is the sum of four consecutive [[prime numbers]] (19 + 23 + 29 + 31).

The sum of [[Euler's totient function]] φ(''x'') over the first eighteen integers is 102.

102 is the third base 10 [[polydivisible number]], since 1 is divisible by 1, 10 is divisible by 2 and 102 is divisible by 3. This also shows that 102 is a [[Harshad number]]. 102 is the first 3-digit number divisible by the numbers 3, 6, 17, 34 and 51.

'''192''' ('''one hundred [and] ninety-two''') is the [[natural number]] following [[191 (number)|191]] and preceding [[193 (number)|193]].

==In mathematics==
* 192 is an [[even number]]
* 192 is the [[Summation|sum]] of ten consecutive [[prime number|prime]]s ([[5 (number)|5]] + [[7 (number)|7]] + [[11 (number)|11]] + [[13 (number)|13]] + [[17 (number)|17]] + [[19 (number)|19]] + [[23 (number)|23]] + [[29 (number)|29]] + [[31 (number)|31]] + [[37 (number)|37]])
* 192 is a [[composite number]], having as its factors [[2 (number)|2]] × [[2 (number)|2]] × [[2 (number)|2]] × [[2 (number)|2]] × [[2 (number)|2]] × [[2 (number)|2]] × [[3 (number)|3]]. Based on this factorization it may also be seen to be a [[regular number]] (its only prime factors are 2 and 3).
* 192 is the smallest number with 14 [[divisor]]s, namely [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[8 (number)|8]], [[12 (number)|12]], [[16 (number)|16]], [[24 (number)|24]], [[32 (number)|32]], [[48 (number)|48]], [[64 (number)|64]], [[96 (number)|96]], and 192 itself. It is an [[abundant number]], as the sum of its proper divisors is 316 which is greater than 192, and a [[practical number]] (subsets of its divisors can be chosen to add to any number up to 192).
* Based on its decimal expansion, 192 is a [[Harshad number]] (it is divisible by 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12) and a [[happy number]] (repeatedly summing the squares of its digits leads from 192 to 86 to 100 to 1).

'''3D pose estimation''' is the problem of determining the transformation of an object in a 2D image which gives the 3D object.  The need for 3D pose estimation arises from the limitations of feature based pose estimation.  There exist environments where it is difficult to extract corners or edges from an image.  To circumvent these issues, the object is dealt with as a whole through the use of free-form contours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bodo Rosenhahn |url=http://www.ks.informatik.uni-kiel.de/modules.php/name+Publikationen |title=Pose Estimation of 3D Free-form Contours in Conformal Geometry |publisher=Institut fur Informatik und Praktische Mathematik, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat zu Kiel |accessdate=2008-06-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603222942/http://www.ks.informatik.uni-kiel.de/modules.php/name%2BPublikationen |archivedate=3 June 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From an uncalibrated 2D camera==
It is possible to estimate the 3D rotation and translation of a 3D object from a single 2D photo, if an approximate 3D model of the object is known and the corresponding points in the 2D image are known. A common technique for solving this has recently{{When|date=February 2011}} been "POSIT",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Javier Barandiaran|title=POSIT tutorial|url=https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Posit|publisher=OpenCV|date=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the 3D pose is estimated directly from the 3D model points and the 2D image points, and corrects the errors iteratively until a good estimate is found from a single image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Dementhon and Davis, 1995 | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=204015 | title = Model-based object pose in 25 lines of code | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | accessdate = 2010-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most implementations of POSIT only work on non-coplanar points (in other words, it won't work with flat objects or planes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Javier Barandiaran | url = http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Posit | title = POSIT tutorial with OpenCV and OpenGL | accessdate = 2010-05-29 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100620131054/http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Posit| archivedate= 20 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is to register a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] CAD model over the photograph of a known object by [[optimizing]] a suitable distance measure with respect to the pose parameters.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | author = Srimal Jayawardena and Marcus Hutter and Nathan Brewer |

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=6128659 |
title = 3D Model Assisted Image Segmentation |
accessdate = 2013-06-01
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The distance measure is computed between the object in the photograph and the 3D [[CAD model]] projection at a given pose.
[[Perspective projection]] or [[orthogonal projection]] is possible depending on the pose representation used.
This approach is appropriate for applications where a 3D CAD model of a known object (or object category) is available.

==From a calibrated 2D camera==
Given a 2D image of an object, and the camera that is calibrated with respect to a world coordinate system, it is also possible to find the pose which gives the 3D object in its object coordinate system.&lt;ref name="Bodo Rosenhahn"&gt;{{cite web | author = Bodo Rosenhahn | url = http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/ROSENHAHN1/CVOnlinePose.html | title = Foundations about 2D-3D Pose Estimation | publisher = CV Online  | accessdate = 2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This works as follows.

=== Extracting 3D from 2D ===
Starting with a 2D image, image points are extracted which correspond to corners in an image.  The projection rays from the image points are reconstructed from the 2D points so that the 3D points, which must be incident with the reconstructed rays, can be determined.

===Pseudocode===
The algorithm for determining pose estimation is based on the [[iterative closest point]] algorithm. The main idea is to determine the correspondences between 2D image features and points on the 3D model curve.  
&lt;code&gt;
   (a)Reconstruct projection rays from the image points&lt;br /&gt;
   (b)Estimate the nearest point of each projection ray to a point on the 3D contour&lt;br /&gt;
   (c)Estimate the pose of the contour with the use of this correspondence set&lt;br /&gt;
   (d)goto (b)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

The above algorithm does not account for images containing an object that is partially occluded.  The following algorithm assumes that all contours are rigidly coupled, meaning the pose of one contour defines the pose of another contour.

&lt;code&gt;
   (a)Reconstruct projection rays from the image points&lt;br /&gt;
   (b)For each projection ray R:&lt;br /&gt;
        (c)For each 3D contour:&lt;br /&gt;
             (c1)Estimate the nearest point P1 of ray R to a point on the contour&lt;br /&gt;
             (c2)if (n==1) choose P1 as actual P for the point-line correspondence&lt;br /&gt;
             (c3)else compare P1 with P:&lt;br /&gt;
                      if dist(P1, R) is smaller than dist(P, R)&lt;br /&gt;
                           then choose P1 as new P&lt;br /&gt;
   (d)Use (P, R) as correspondence set.&lt;br /&gt;
   (e)Estimate pose with this correspondence set&lt;br /&gt;
   (f)Transform contours, goto (b)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

In practice, using a 2&amp;nbsp;GHz Intel [[Pentium]] processor, average speeds of 29[[Frames per second|fps]] have been reached using the above algorithm.&lt;ref name="Bodo Rosenhahn"/&gt;

== Estimating pose through comparison ==
Systems exist which use a database of an object at different rotations and translations to compare an input image against to estimate pose.  These systems accuracy is limited to situations which are represented in their database of images, however the goal is to recognize a pose, rather than determine it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vassilis Athitsos | url =  | title = Estimating 3D Hand Pose from a Cluttered Image | publisher = Boston University Computer Science Tech.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Metric America: A Decision Whose Time Has Come''''' was a 1971 book by the United States [[National Bureau of Standards]] (now the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]) printed by the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]].

In 1968, in the Metric Study Act (Pub. L. 90-472, August 9, 1968, 82 Stat. 693), Congress authorized a three-year study of systems of measurement in the U.S., with particular emphasis on the feasibility of adopting the [[International System of Units|SI]]. This detailed U.S. Metric Study was conducted by the [[Department of Commerce]]. A 45-member advisory panel consulted with and took testimony from hundreds of consumers, business organizations, labor groups, manufacturers, and state and local officials.

'''''A Metric America: "A Decision Whose Time Has Come" – For Real''''' ([[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]&lt;span title="Interagency Report"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; 4858) was a June 1992 followup to this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10310">In [[computer science]], '''augmented Backus–Naur form''' ('''ABNF''') is a [[metalanguage]] based on [[Backus–Naur form]] (BNF), but consisting of its own syntax and derivation rules. The motive principle for ABNF is to describe a [[formal system]] of a language to be used as a bidirectional [[communications protocol]]. It is defined by [https://tools.ietf.org/html/std68 ''Internet Standard 68''] ("STD 68", type case sic), which {{as of|2010|12|lc=on}} is {{IETF RFC|5234}}, and it often serves as the definition language for [[IETF]] communication protocols.&lt;ref name="Internet Standards"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; RFC 7405 updates it, adding a syntax for specifying case-sensitive string literals.

==Introduction==

An ABNF specification is a set of derivation rules, written as

 rule = definition ; comment CR LF

where rule is a [[case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] [[nonterminal]], the definition consists of sequences of symbols that define the rule, a comment for documentation, and ending with a carriage return and line feed.

Rule names are case-insensitive: &lt;code&gt;&lt;rulename&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;Rulename&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;RULENAME&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;&lt;rUlENamE&gt;&lt;/code&gt; all refer to the same rule. Rule names consist of a letter followed by letters, numbers, and hyphens.

Angle brackets (&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) are not required around rule names (as they are in BNF). However, they may be used to delimit a rule name when used in prose to discern a rule name.

==Terminal values==

[[Terminal symbol|Terminals]] are specified by one or more numeric characters.

Numeric characters may be specified as the percent sign &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;, followed by the base (&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; = binary, &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; = decimal, and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; = hexadecimal), followed by the value, or concatenation of values (indicated by &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;). For example, a carriage return is specified by &lt;code&gt;%d13&lt;/code&gt; in decimal or &lt;code&gt;%x0D&lt;/code&gt; in hexadecimal. A carriage return followed by a line feed may be specified with concatenation as &lt;code&gt;%d13.10&lt;/code&gt;.

Literal text is specified through the use of a string enclosed in quotation marks (&lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;). These strings are case-insensitive, and the character set used is (US-)ASCII. Therefore, the string &lt;code&gt;"abc"&lt;/code&gt; will match “abc”, “Abc”, “aBc”, “abC”, “ABc”, “AbC”, “aBC”, and “ABC”. RFC 7405 added a syntax for case-sensitive strings: &lt;code&gt;%s"aBc"&lt;/code&gt; will only match "aBc". Prior to that, a case-sensitive string could only be specified by listing the individual characters: to match “aBc”, the definition would be &lt;code&gt;%d97.66.99&lt;/code&gt;. A string can also be explicitly specified as case-insensitive with a &lt;code&gt;%i&lt;/code&gt; prefix.

==Operators==

===White space===
White space is used to separate elements of a definition; for space to be recognized as a delimiter, it must be explicitly included. The explicit reference for a single whitespace character is &lt;code&gt;WSP&lt;/code&gt; (linear white space), and &lt;code&gt;LWSP&lt;/code&gt; is for zero or more whitespace characters with newlines permitted. The &lt;code&gt;LWSP&lt;/code&gt; definition in RFC5234 is controversial&lt;ref name="RFC5234 Errata"&gt;[http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=5234&amp;eid=3096 RFC Errata 3096].&lt;/ref&gt; because at least one whitespace character is needed to form a delimiter between two fields.

Definitions are left-aligned. When multiple lines are required (for readability), continuation lines are indented by whitespace.

===Comment===
&lt;code&gt;; comment&lt;/code&gt;

A semicolon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;) starts a comment that continues to the end of the line.

===Concatenation===
&lt;code&gt;Rule1 Rule2&lt;/code&gt;

A rule may be defined by listing a sequence of rule names.

To match the string “aba”, the following rules could be used:
#&lt;code&gt;fu = %x61	; a&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;bar = %x62	; b&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;mumble = fu bar fu&lt;/code&gt;

===Alternative===
&lt;code&gt;Rule1 / Rule2&lt;/code&gt;

A rule may be defined by a list of alternative rules separated by a [[Solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;).

To accept the rule ''fu'' or the rule ''bar'', the following rule could be constructed:
#&lt;code&gt;fubar = fu / bar&lt;/code&gt;

===Incremental alternatives===
&lt;code&gt;Rule1 =/ Rule2&lt;/code&gt;

Additional alternatives may be added to a rule through the use of &lt;code&gt;=/&lt;/code&gt; between the rule name and the definition.

The rule
#&lt;code&gt;ruleset = alt1 / alt2 / alt3 / alt4 / alt5&lt;/code&gt;
is equivalent to 
#&lt;code&gt;ruleset = alt1 / alt2&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;ruleset =/ alt3&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;ruleset =/ alt4 / alt5&lt;/code&gt;

===Value range===
&lt;code&gt;%c##-##&lt;/code&gt;

A range of numeric values may be specified through the use of a hyphen (&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;).

The rule
#&lt;code&gt;OCTAL = "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7"&lt;/code&gt;
is equivalent to
#&lt;code&gt;OCTAL = %x30-37&lt;/code&gt;

===Sequence group===
&lt;code&gt;(Rule1 Rule2)&lt;/code&gt;

Elements may be placed in parentheses to group rules in a definition.

To match “elem fubar snafu” or “elem tarfu snafu”, the following rule could be constructed:
#&lt;code&gt;group = elem (fubar / tarfu) snafu&lt;/code&gt;

To match “elem fubar” or “tarfu snafu”, the following rules could be constructed:
#&lt;code&gt;group = elem fubar / tarfu snafu&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;group = (elem fubar) / (tarfu snafu)&lt;/code&gt;

===Variable repetition===
&lt;code&gt;n*nRule&lt;/code&gt;

To indicate repetition of an element, the form &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;element&lt;/code&gt; is used. The optional &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives the minimal number of elements to be included (with the default of 0). The optional &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives the maximal number of elements to be included (with the default of infinity).

Use &lt;code&gt;*element&lt;/code&gt; for zero or more elements, &lt;code&gt;*1element&lt;/code&gt; for zero or one element, &lt;code&gt;1*element&lt;/code&gt; for one or more elements, and &lt;code&gt;2*3element&lt;/code&gt; for two or three elements, cf. [[regular expression]]s &lt;code&gt;e*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;e?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;e+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;e{2,3}&lt;/code&gt;.

===Specific repetition===
&lt;code&gt;nRule&lt;/code&gt;

To indicate an explicit number of elements, the form &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;element&lt;/code&gt; is used and is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;*&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;element&lt;/code&gt;.

Use &lt;code&gt;2DIGIT&lt;/code&gt; to get two numeric digits, and &lt;code&gt;3DIGIT&lt;/code&gt; to get three numeric digits. (&lt;code&gt;DIGIT&lt;/code&gt; is defined below under "[[#Core rules|Core rules]]". Also see ''zip-code'' in the example below.)

===Optional sequence===
&lt;code&gt;[Rule]&lt;/code&gt;

To indicate an optional element, the following constructions are equivalent:
#&lt;code&gt;[fubar snafu]&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;*1(fubar snafu)&lt;/code&gt;
#&lt;code&gt;0*1(fubar snafu)&lt;/code&gt;

===Operator precedence===
The following operators have the given precedence from tightest binding to loosest binding:
#Strings, names formation
#Comment
#Value range
#Repetition
#Grouping, optional
#Concatenation
#Alternative

Use of the alternative operator with concatenation may be confusing, and it is recommended that grouping be used to make explicit concatenation groups.

===Core rules===
The core rules are defined in the ABNF standard.

==Example==
The postal address example given in the augmented Backus–Naur form (ABNF) page may be specified as follows:
&lt;source lang=abnf&gt;
postal-address   = name-part street zip-part

name-part        = *(personal-part SP) last-name [SP suffix] CRLF
name-part        =/ personal-part CRLF

personal-part    = first-name / (initial ".")
first-name       = *ALPHA
initial          = ALPHA
last-name        = *ALPHA
suffix           = ("Jr." / "Sr." / 1*("I" / "V" / "X"))

street           = [apt SP] house-num SP street-name CRLF
apt              = 1*4DIGIT
house-num        = 1*8(DIGIT / ALPHA)
street-name      = 1*VCHAR

zip-part         = town-name "," SP state 1*2SP zip-code CRLF
town-name        = 1*(ALPHA / SP)
state            = 2ALPHA
zip-code         = 5DIGIT ["-" 4DIGIT]
&lt;/source&gt;

==Pitfalls==

[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5234.txt RFC 5234] adds a warning in conjunction to the definition of LWSP as follows: 
{{quote|Use of this linear-white-space rule permits lines containing only white space that are no longer legal in mail headers and have caused interoperability problems in other contexts. Do not use when defining mail headers and use with caution in other contexts.}}

[[File:Breach Attack logo.svg|thumb|The official logo]]
'''BREACH''' (a [[backronym]]: '''Browser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext''') is a [[exploit (computer security)|security exploit]] against [[HTTPS]] when using [[HTTP compression]]. BREACH is built based on the [[CRIME (security exploit)|CRIME security exploit]]. BREACH was announced at the August 2013 [[Black Hat Briefings|Black Hat]] conference by security researchers Angelo Prado, Neal Harris and Yoel Gluck. The idea had been discussed in community before the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/20406/is-http-compression-safe |title=Is HTTP compression safe? |website=Information Security Stack Exchange |access-date=2018-04-11 |archive-url=https://archive.li/MibCy |archive-date=2018-04-11 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==

While the CRIME attack was presented as a general attack that could work effectively against a large number of protocols, only exploits against SPDY request compression and TLS compression were demonstrated and largely mitigated in browsers and servers. The CRIME exploit against HTTP compression has not been mitigated at all, even though the authors of CRIME have warned that this vulnerability might be even more widespread than SPDY and TLS compression combined.

BREACH is an instance of the CRIME attack against HTTP compression—the use of [[gzip]] or [[DEFLATE]] data compression algorithms via the content-encoding option within [[HTTP]] by many web browsers and servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/08/gone-in-30-seconds-new-attack-plucks-secrets-from-https-protected-pages/ |title=Gone in 30 seconds: New attack plucks secrets from HTTPS-protected pages|first=Dan |last=Goodin |date=August 1, 2013| publisher = Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given this compression oracle, the rest of the BREACH attack follows the same general lines as the CRIME exploit, by performing an initial blind [[brute-force search]] to guess a few bytes, followed by [[divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer]] search to expand a correct guess to an arbitrarily large amount of content.

==Mitigation==

BREACH exploits the compression in the underlying HTTP protocol. Therefore, turning off TLS compression makes no difference to BREACH, which can still perform a [[chosen-plaintext attack]] against the HTTP payload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.blackhat.com/us-13/US-13-Prado-SSL-Gone-in-30-seconds-A-BREACH-beyond-CRIME-Slides.pdf|title=SSL, gone in 30 seconds: A BREACH beyond CRIME|author=Angelo Prado, Neal Harris and Yoel Gluck|accessdate=2013-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, clients and servers are either forced to disable HTTP compression completely (thus reducing performance), or to adopt workarounds to try to foil BREACH in individual attack scenarios, such as using [[cross-site request forgery]] (CSRF) protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cisco.com/security/breach-crime-and-blackhat/|title=BREACH, CRIME and Black Hat |publisher = Cisco |author=Omar Santos |date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another suggested approach is to disable HTTP compression whenever the referrer header indicates a cross-site request, or when the header is not present.&lt;ref name="ristic1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/08/07/defending-against-the-breach-attack|title=Defending against the BREACH Attack|author=Ivan Ristic|publisher=Qualys.com|date=October 14, 2013|accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.qualys.com/message/20360|title=BREACH mitigation|author=manu|publisher=Qualys Community|date=October 14, 2013|accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach allows effective mitigation of the attack without losing functionality, only incurring a performance penalty on affected requests.

Around 2013-2014, there was an [[IETF]] draft proposal for a TLS extension for length-hiding padding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pironti-tls-length-hiding-02|title=Length Hiding Padding for the Transport Layer Security Protocol|author=A. Pironti, et al|date=2013-09-11|accessdate=2017-10-18|publisher=IETF Network Working Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, in theory, could be used as a mitigation against this attack.&lt;ref name="ristic1"/&gt;  It allows the actual length of the TLS payload to be disguised by the insertion of padding to round it up to a fixed set of lengths, or to randomize the external length, thereby decreasing the likelihood of detecting small changes in compression ratio that is the basis for the BREACH attack.  However, this draft has since expired without further action.

:&lt;math&gt;\langle Qx_1\dots Qx_n\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

of [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] for ''Q''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{∀,∃}. It is a special case of [[generalized quantifier]]. In  [[classical logic]], quantifier prefixes are linearly ordered such that the value of a variable ''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' bound by a quantifier ''Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' depends on the value of the variables

: ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''m''−1&lt;/sub&gt;

bound by quantifiers

: ''Qy''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''Qy''&lt;sub&gt;''m''−1&lt;/sub&gt;

preceding ''Q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''. In a logic with (finite) partially ordered quantification this is not in general the case.

Branching quantification first appeared in a 1959 conference paper of [[Leon Henkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Henkin, L. "Some Remarks on Infinitely Long Formulas". ''Infinitistic Methods: Proceedings of the Symposium on Foundations of Mathematics, Warsaw, 2–9 September 1959'', Panstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe and Pergamon Press, Warsaw, 1961, pp. 167–183. {{OCLC|2277863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems of partially ordered quantification are intermediate in strength between first-order logic and second-order logic. They are being used as a basis for [[Jaakko Hintikka|Hintikka's]] and Gabriel Sandu's [[independence-friendly logic]].

==Definition and properties==

The simplest Henkin quantifier &lt;math&gt;Q_H&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;(Q_Hx_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)\varphi(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)\equiv\begin{pmatrix}\forall x_1 \, \exists y_1\\ \forall x_2 \, \exists y_2\end{pmatrix}\varphi(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2).&lt;/math&gt;

It (in fact every formula with a Henkin prefix, not just the simplest one) is equivalent to its second-order [[Skolemization]], i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;\exists f \, \exists g \, \forall x_1 \forall x_2 \, \varphi (x_1, x_2, f(x_1), g(x_2)). &lt;/math&gt;

It is also powerful enough to define the quantifier &lt;math&gt;Q_{\geq\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. "there are infinitely many") defined as

:&lt;math&gt;(Q_{\geq\mathbb{N}}x)\varphi (x)\equiv\exists a(Q_Hx_1,x_2,y_1,y_2)[\varphi a\land (x_1=x_2 \leftrightarrow y_1=y_2) \land (\varphi (x_1)\rightarrow (\varphi (y_1)\land y_1\neq a))].&lt;/math&gt;

Several things follow from this, including the nonaxiomatizability of first-order logic with &lt;math&gt;Q_H&lt;/math&gt; (first observed by [[Ehrenfeucht]]), and its equivalence to the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^1&lt;/math&gt;-fragment of [[second-order logic]] ([[existential second-order logic]])&amp;mdash;the latter result published independently in 1970 by [[Herbert Enderton]]&lt;ref&gt;Jaakko Hintikka and Gabriel Sandu, "Game-theoretical semantics", in ''Handbook of logic and language'', ed.

The following quantifiers are also definable by &lt;math&gt;Q_H&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Badia2009"/&gt;

which is known to have no first-order logic equivalent.&lt;ref name="Amsterdam"/&gt;

The idea of branching is not necessarily restricted to using the classical quantifiers as leaves. In a 1979 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Barwise | first1 = J. | title = On branching quantifiers in English | doi = 10.1007/BF00258419 | journal = Journal of Philosophical Logic | volume = 8 | year = 1979 | pmid =  | pmc = | pages = 47–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Barwise]] proposed variations of Hintikka sentences (as the above is sometimes called) in which the inner quantifiers are themselves [[generalized quantifiers]], for example: "Most villagers and most townsmen hate each other."&lt;ref name="Amsterdam"/&gt; Observing that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1^1&lt;/math&gt; is not closed under negation, Barwise also proposed a practical test to determine whether natural language sentences really involve branching quantifiers, namely to test whether their natural-language negation involves universal quantification over a set variable (a &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1^1&lt;/math&gt; sentence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Michael | last1 = Hand | title = The Journal of Symbolic Logic | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | year = 1998 | publisher = Association for Symbolic Logic | jstor = 2586678 | pages = 1611–1614 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hintikka's proposal was met with skepticism by a number of logicians because some first-order sentences like the one below appear to capture well enough the natural language Hintikka sentence.

: &lt;math&gt;[\forall x_1 \, \exists y_1 \, \forall x_2 \, \exists y_2\, \varphi (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2)] \wedge [\forall x_2 \, \exists y_2 \, \forall x_1 \, \exists y_1\, \varphi (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2)]&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) &lt;/math&gt;

denotes

: &lt;math&gt; (V(x_1) \wedge T(x_2)) \rightarrow (R(x_1,y_1) \wedge R(x_2,y_2) \wedge H(y_1, y_2) \wedge H(y_2, y_1))&lt;/math&gt;

Although much purely theoretical debate followed, it wasn't until 2009 that some empirical tests with students trained in logic found that they are more likely to assign models matching the "bidirectional" first-order sentence rather than branching-quantifier sentence to several natural-language constructs derived from the Hintikka sentence. For instance students were shown undirected [[bipartite graph]]s&amp;mdash;with squares and circles as vertices&amp;mdash;and asked to say whether sentences like "more than 3 circles and more than 3 squares are connected by lines" were correctly describing the diagrams.&lt;ref name="Amsterdam"/&gt;

In [[algebra]], the '''Bring radical''' or '''ultraradical''' of a [[real number]]&amp;nbsp;''a'' is the unique real [[root of a polynomial|root]] of the [[polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;x^5 + x + a.&lt;/math&gt;

The Bring radical of a complex number ''a'' is either any of the five roots of the above polynomial (it is thus [[multi-valued]]), or a specific root, which is usually chosen in order that the Bring radical is a function of ''a'', which is real-valued when ''a'' is real, and is an [[analytic function]] in a neighborhood of the real line. Because of the existence of four [[branch point]]s, the Bring radical cannot be defined as a function that is continuous over the whole [[complex plane]], and its domain of continuity must exclude four [[branch cut]]s.

[[George Jerrard]] showed that some [[quintic equation]]s can be [[closed form solution|solved in closed form]] using [[Nth root|radicals]] and Bring radicals, which had been introduced by [[Erland Samuel Bring|Erland Bring]].

In this article, the Bring radical of ''a'' is denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{BR}(a).&lt;/math&gt; For real argument, it is odd, monotonically decreasing, and unbounded, with asymptotic behavior &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BR}(a) \sim -a^{1/5}&lt;/math&gt; for large &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

==Normal forms==
The quintic equation is rather difficult to obtain solutions for directly, with five independent coefficients in its most general form:

:&lt;math&gt;x^5 + a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0 = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The various methods for solving the quintic that have been developed generally attempt to simplify the quintic using [[Tschirnhaus transformation]]s to reduce the number of independent coefficients.

===Principal quintic form===
The general quintic may be reduced into what is known as the '''principal quintic form''', with the quartic and cubic terms removed:

:&lt;math&gt;y^5 + c_2y^2 + c_1y + c_0 = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

If the roots of a general quintic and a principal quintic are related by a quadratic Tschirnhaus transformation

:&lt;math&gt;y_k = x_k^2 + \alpha x_k + \beta \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

the coefficients ''α'' and ''β'' may be determined by using the [[resultant]], or by means of the [[power sum symmetric polynomial|power sums of the roots]] and [[Newton's identities]]. This leads to a system of equations in ''α'' and ''β'' consisting of a quadratic and a linear equation, and either of the two sets of solutions may be used to obtain the corresponding three coefficients of the principal quintic form.&lt;ref name="adamchik"&gt;

This form is used by [[Felix Klein]]'s solution to the quintic.&lt;ref name="klein"&gt;{{cite book

It is possible to simplify the quintic still further and eliminate the quadratic term, producing the '''Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard normal form''':
:&lt;math&gt;v^5 + d_1v + d_0 = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
Using the power-sum formulae again with a cubic transformation as [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus|Tschirnhaus]] tried does not work, since the resulting system of equations results in a sixth-degree equation. But in 1796 [[Erland Samuel Bring|Bring]] found a way around this by using a quartic Tschirnhaus transformation to relate the roots of a principal quintic to those of a Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard quintic:

:&lt;math&gt;v_k = y^4_k + \alpha y^3_k + \beta y^2_k + \gamma y_k + \delta\, .&lt;/math&gt;

The extra parameter this fourth-order transformation provides allowed Bring to decrease the degrees of the other parameters. This leads to a system of five equations in six unknowns, which then requires the solution of a cubic and a quadratic equation. This method was also discovered by [[George Jerrard|Jerrard]] in 1852,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As might be expected from the complexity of these transformations, the resulting expressions can be enormous, particularly when compared to the solutions in radicals for lower degree equations, taking many megabytes of storage for a general quintic with symbolic coefficients.&lt;ref name="qmathematica"/&gt;

Regarded as an algebraic function, the solutions to

:&lt;math&gt;v^5+d_1v+d_0 = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

involve two variables, ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; however, the reduction is actually to an algebraic function of one variable, very much analogous to a solution in radicals, since we may further reduce the Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard form. If we for instance set

:&lt;math&gt;z = {v \over \sqrt[4]{-\frac{d_1}{5}}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

then we reduce the equation to the form

:&lt;math&gt;z^5 - 5z - 4t = 0\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

which involves ''z'' as an algebraic function of a single variable&amp;nbsp;''t'', where &lt;math&gt;t=-(d_0/4)(-d_1/5)^{-5/4}&lt;/math&gt;. A similar transformation suffices to reduce the equation to

:&lt;math&gt;u^5 - u + a = 0\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the form required by the Hermite–Kronecker–Brioschi method, Glasser's method, and the Cockle–Harley method of differential resolvents described below.

===Brioschi normal form===
There is another one-parameter normal form for the quintic equation, known as '''Brioschi normal form'''
:&lt;math&gt;w^5 - 10Cw^3 + 45C^2w - C^2 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
which can be derived by using the rational Tschirnhaus transformation

: &lt;math&gt;w_k = \frac{\lambda + \mu x_k}{\frac{x_k^2}{C}-3}&lt;/math&gt;

to relate the roots of a general quintic to a Brioschi quintic. The values of the parameters &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu\,&lt;/math&gt; may be derived by using [[polyhedral function]]s on the [[Riemann sphere]], and are related to the partition of an object of [[icosahedral symmetry]] into five objects of [[tetrahedral symmetry]].&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite book

It is to be noted that this Tschirnhaus transformation is rather simpler than the difficult one used to transform a principal quintic into Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard form. This normal form is used by the Doyle&amp;ndash;McMullen iteration method and the Kiepert method.

==Series representation==
A [[Taylor series]] for Bring radicals, as well as a representation in terms of [[generalized hypergeometric function|hypergeometric function]]s can be derived as follows. The equation &lt;math&gt;x^5+x+a=0\,&lt;/math&gt; can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;x^5+x=-a\,&lt;/math&gt;; by setting &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^5+x\,&lt;/math&gt;, the desired solution is &lt;math&gt;x=f^{-1}(-a)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The series for &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\,&lt;/math&gt; can then be obtained by [[Lagrange inversion theorem|reversion]] of the [[Taylor series]] for &lt;math&gt;f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; (which is simply &lt;math&gt;x+x^5\,&lt;/math&gt;), giving:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(a) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{5k}{k} \frac{(-1)^k a^{4k+1}}{4k+1} = a - a^5 + 5 a^9 - 35 a^{13} + ...&lt;/math&gt;

where the absolute values of the coefficients are sequence [[OEIS:A002294|A002294]] in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]]. The series confirms that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(a)\,&lt;/math&gt; is odd. This gives

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{BR}(a) = f^{-1}(-a) = -f^{-1}(a) = -a + a^5 - 5 a^9 + 35 a^{13} + ... \,&lt;/math&gt;

The series converges for &lt;math&gt; |a|&lt; 4/(5 \cdot \sqrt[4]{5}) \approx 0.53499 &lt;/math&gt; and can be analytically continued in the complex plane. The above result can be written in hypergeometric form as:&lt;ref name=qmathematica/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{BR}(a) = -a \,\,_4F_3\left(\frac{1}{5},\frac{2}{5},\frac{3}{5},\frac{4}{5};\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4},\frac{5}{4};-5\left(\frac{5a}{4}\right)^4\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Compare with the hypergeometric functions that arise in Glasser's derivation and the method of differential resolvents below.

==Solution of the general quintic==
We now may express the roots of any polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;x^5 + px +q\,&lt;/math&gt;

in terms of the Bring radical as

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[4]{-\frac{p}{5}}\,\operatorname{BR}\left(-\frac{1}{4}\left(-\frac{5}{p}\right)^{\frac{5}{4}}q\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and its four [[complex conjugate|conjugate]]s. We have a reduction to the Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard form in terms of solvable polynomial equations, and we used transformations involving polynomial expressions in the roots only up to the fourth degree, which means inverting the transformation may be done by finding the roots of a polynomial solvable in radicals. This procedure produces extraneous solutions, but when we have found the correct ones by numerical means we can also write down the roots of the quintic in terms of square roots, cube roots, and the Bring radical, which is therefore an algebraic solution in terms of algebraic functions of a single variable &amp;mdash; an algebraic solution of the general quintic.

==Other characterizations==
Many other characterizations of the Bring radical have been developed, the first of which is in terms of [[elliptic modular function]]s by [[Charles Hermite]] in 1858, and further methods later developed by other mathematicians.

===The Hermite–Kronecker–Brioschi characterization===
In 1858, Charles Hermite&lt;ref name="hermite"&gt;

{{cite journal
 | last = Kronecker

:&lt;math&gt;x^5 - x + a = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

into which any quintic equation may be reduced by means of Tschirnhaus transformations as has been shown. He observed that [[elliptic function]]s had an analogous role to play in the solution of the Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard quintic as the trigonometric functions had for the cubic. If &lt;math&gt;K\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K'\,&lt;/math&gt; are the periods of an [[elliptic integral]] of the first kind:
:&lt;math&gt;K = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{d\varphi}{\sqrt{1-k^2 \sin^2\varphi}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K' = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{d\varphi}{\sqrt{1-k'^2 \sin^2\varphi}}&lt;/math&gt;
the [[nome (mathematics)|elliptic nome]] is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;q =e^{-\frac{\pi K'}{K}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;k^2 + k'^2 = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;

With
:&lt;math&gt;q = e^{-\frac{\pi K'}{K}} = e^{{\mathrm{i}} \pi \tau}\,&lt;/math&gt;
define the two [[elliptic modular function]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[4]{k} = \varphi(\tau) = \sqrt{\frac{\vartheta_{10}(0; \tau)}{\vartheta_{00}(0; \tau)}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[4]{k'} = \psi(\tau) = \sqrt{\frac{\vartheta_{01}(0; \tau)}{\vartheta_{00}(0; \tau)}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\vartheta_{00}(0; \tau)&lt;/math&gt; and similar are Jacobi [[theta function]]s.

If ''n'' is a [[prime number]], we can define two values ''u'' and ''v'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \varphi(n\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;u = \varphi(\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt;

The parameters &lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; are linked by an equation of degree ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 known as the [[modular equation]], whose ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 roots are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon\varphi(n\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi\left(\frac{\tau + 16m}{n}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ε is 1 or &amp;minus;1 depending on whether 2 is a [[quadratic residue]] with respect to ''n'' or not, and ''m'' is an integer modulo&amp;nbsp;''n''. For ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, we have the modular equation of the sixth degree:

:&lt;math&gt;u^6 - v^6 + 5u^2v^2(u^2-v^2)+4uv(1-u^4v^4)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

with six roots as shown above.

The modular equation of the sixth degree may be related to the Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard quintic by the following function of the six roots of the modular equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(\tau) = \left[\varphi(5\tau) + \varphi\left(\frac{\tau}{5}\right)\right]\left[\varphi\left(\frac{\tau+16}{5}\right) - \varphi\left(\frac{\tau + 64}{5}\right)\right]\left[\varphi\left(\frac{\tau+32}{5}\right) - \varphi\left(\frac{\tau + 48}{5}\right)\right]\,&lt;/math&gt;

The five quantities &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\tau+16)\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\tau+32)\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\tau+48)\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\tau+64)\,&lt;/math&gt; are the roots of a quintic equation with coefficients rational in &lt;math&gt;\varphi(\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi^5 - 2000\varphi^4(\tau)\psi^{16}(\tau)\Phi + 1600\sqrt{5}\varphi^3(\tau)\psi^{16}(\tau)\left[1 + \varphi^8(\tau)\right] = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

which may be readily converted into the Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard form by the substitution:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = 2\sqrt[4]{125}\varphi(\tau)\psi^4(\tau)x\,&lt;/math&gt;

leading to the Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard quintic:

:&lt;math&gt;x^5 - x + a = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{2[1 + \varphi^8(\tau)]}{\sqrt[4]{5^5}\varphi^2(\tau)\psi^4(\tau)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The Hermite&amp;ndash;Kronecker&amp;ndash;Brioschi method then amounts to finding a value for τ that corresponds to the value of ''a'', and then using that value of τ to obtain the roots of the corresponding modular equation. To do this, let

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{a\sqrt[4]{5^5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and calculate the required elliptic modulus &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; by solving the quartic equation:

:&lt;math&gt;k^4 + A^2k^3 + 2k^2 - A^2k + 1 = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

The roots of this equation are:

:&lt;math&gt;k = \tan \frac{\alpha}{4}, \tan \frac{\alpha+2\pi}{4}, \tan \frac{\pi - \alpha}{4}, \tan \frac{3\pi - \alpha}{4} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sin \alpha = \frac{4}{A^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The value of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; may be easily obtained from the elliptic modulus &lt;math&gt;k\,&lt;/math&gt; by the relations given above. The roots of the Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard quintic are then given by:
:&lt;math&gt;x_i = \frac{\Phi(\tau + 16i)}{2\sqrt[4]{125}\varphi(\tau)\psi^4(\tau)}&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;i = 0, \ldots, 4&lt;/math&gt;.

It may be seen that this process uses a generalization of the [[nth root]], which may be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x} = \exp \left( {\frac{1}{n}\ln x} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
or more to the point, as
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x} = \exp \left(\frac{1}{n}\int^x_1\frac{dt}{t}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The Hermite&amp;ndash;Kronecker&amp;ndash;Brioschi method essentially replaces the exponential by an elliptic modular function, and the integral &lt;math&gt;\int^x_1\frac{dt}{t}&lt;/math&gt; by an elliptic integral. Kronecker thought that this generalization was a special case of a still more general theorem, which would be applicable to equations of arbitrarily high degree. This theorem, known as [[Thomae's formula]], was fully expressed by Hiroshi Umemura&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-8176-4578-6_18|title=Resolution of algebraic equations by theta constants (in: David Mumford, Tata Lectures on Theta II)|last=Umemura|first=Hiroshi|date=2007|publisher=Birkhäuser, Boston, MA|year=|isbn=9780817645694|series=Modern Birkhäuser Classics|location=|pages=261–270|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4578-6_18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1984, who used [[Siegel modular form]]s in place of the exponential/elliptic modular function, and the integral by a [[hyperelliptic integral]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; generalizes the series method presented earlier in this article to find a solution to any [[trinomial]] equation of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;
x^N - x + t=0 \,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the quintic equation can be reduced to this form by the use of Tschirnhaus transformations as shown above. Let &lt;math&gt;x = \zeta^{-\frac{1}{N-1}}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the general form becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;
\zeta = e^{2\pi i} + t\phi(\zeta) \,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi(\zeta) = \zeta^{\frac{N}{N-1}} \,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

A formula due to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] states that for any [[analytic function]] &lt;math&gt;f \,&lt;/math&gt;, in the neighborhood of a root of the transformed general equation in terms of &lt;math&gt;\zeta \,&lt;/math&gt;, above may be expressed as an [[infinite series]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
f(\zeta) = f(e^{2\pi {\mathrm{i}}}) + \sum^\infty_{n=1} \frac{t^n}{n!}\frac{d^{n-1}}{da^{n-1}}[f'(a)|\phi(a)|^n]_{a = e^{2\pi {\mathrm{i}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

If we let &lt;math&gt;f(\zeta) = \zeta^{-\frac{1}{N-1}}\,&lt;/math&gt; in this formula, we can come up with the root:

:&lt;math&gt;
x_k = e^{-\frac{2k\pi {\rm{i}}}{N -1}} - \frac{t}{N-1}\sum^\infty_{n=0}\frac{(te^{\frac{2k\pi {\rm{i}}}{N-1}})^n}{\Gamma(n + 2)}\cdot \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{Nn}{N-1} + 1\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{N-1} + 1\right)} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; k=1,2, 3, \dots , N-1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

By the use of the [[Gauss multiplication theorem]] the infinite series above may be broken up into a finite series of [[hypergeometric function]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(q) =\left(\frac{e^{\frac{2n\pi {\rm{i}}}{N-1}} t}{N-1}\right)^q N^{\frac{qN}{N-1}}\frac{\prod_{k=0}^{N-1}\Gamma\left(\frac{q}{N-1} + \frac{1 + k}{N}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{q}{N-1} + 1\right)\prod^{N-2}_{k=0}\Gamma\left(\frac{q+k+2}{N-1}\right)}
=\left(\frac{te^{\frac{2n\pi {\rm{i}}}{N-1}}}{N-1}\right)^q N^{\frac{qN}{N-1}}\prod_{k=2}^{N}\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{q}{N-1}+\frac{k-1}{N}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{q+k}{N-1}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
x_n = e^{-\frac{2n\pi {\rm{i}}}{N-1}} - \frac{t}{(N-1)^2}\sqrt{\frac{N}{2\pi(N-1)}}\sum^{N-2}_{q=0}\psi_n(q)_{(N+1)}F_N
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{qN+N-1}{N(N-1)}, \ldots, \frac{q+N-1}{N-1}, 1; \\[8pt]

\frac{q+2}{N-1}, \ldots, \frac{q+N}{N-1}, \frac{q+N-1}{N-1}; \\[8pt]

\left(\frac{te^{\frac{2n\pi {\rm{i}}}{N-1}} }{N-1}\right)^{N-1}N^N
\end{bmatrix},\quad n=1,2, 3, \dots , N-1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
x_N = \sum_{m=1}^{N-1} \frac{t}{(N-1)^2}\sqrt{\frac{N}{2\pi(N-1)}}\sum^{N-2}_{q=0}\psi_m(q)_{(N+1)}F_N
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{qN+N-1}{N(N-1)}, \ldots, \frac{q+N-1}{N-1}, 1; \\[8pt]

\frac{q+2}{N-1}, \ldots, \frac{q+N}{N-1}, \frac{q+N-1}{N-1}; \\[8pt]

\left(\frac{te^{\frac{2m\pi {\rm{i}}}{N-1}} }{N-1}\right)^{N-1}N^N
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and the trinomial of the form has roots

A root of the equation can thus be expressed as the sum of at most ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 hypergeometric functions. Applying this method to the reduced Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard quintic, define the following functions:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F_1(t) &amp; = \,_4F_3\left(-\frac{1}{20}, \frac{3}{20}, \frac{7}{20}, \frac{11}{20}; \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{4}; \frac{3125t^4}{256}\right) \\[6pt]
F_2(t) &amp; = \,_4F_3\left(\frac{1}{5}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}; \frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}; \frac{3125t^4}{256}\right) \\[6pt]
F_3(t) &amp; = \,_4F_3\left(\frac{9}{20}, \frac{13}{20}, \frac{17}{20}, \frac{21}{20}; \frac{3}{4}, \frac{5}{4}, \frac{3}{2}; \frac{3125t^4}{256}\right) \\[6pt]
F_4(t) &amp; = \,_4F_3\left(\frac{7}{10}, \frac{9}{10}, \frac{11}{10}, \frac{13}{10}; \frac{5}{4}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{7}{4}; \frac{3125t^4}{256}\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

which are the hypergeometric functions that appear in the series formula above. The roots of the quintic are thus:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcrcccccc}
x_1 &amp; = &amp; {} -tF_2(t) \\[8pt]
x_2 &amp; = &amp; {} -F_1(t) &amp; + &amp; \frac{1}{4}tF_2(t) &amp; + &amp; \frac{5}{32}t^2F_3(t) &amp; + &amp; \frac{5}{32}t^3F_4(t)\\[8pt]

x_3 &amp; = &amp; F_1(t) &amp; + &amp; \frac{1}{4}tF_2(t) &amp; - &amp; \frac{5}{32}t^2F_3(t) &amp; + &amp; \frac{5}{32}t^3F_4(t)\\[8pt]

x_4 &amp; = &amp; {} -i F_1(t) &amp; + &amp; \frac{1}{4}tF_2(t) &amp; - &amp; \frac{5}{32}i t^2F_3(t) &amp; - &amp; \frac{5}{32}t^3F_4(t)\\[8pt]

x_5 &amp; = &amp; i F_1(t) &amp; + &amp; \frac{1}{4}tF_2(t) &amp; + &amp; \frac{5}{32}i t^2F_3(t) &amp; - &amp; \frac{5}{32}t^3F_4(t)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is essentially the same result as that obtained by the following method.

===The method of differential resolvents===

They consider the roots as being functions of the coefficients, and calculate a differential resolvent based on these equations. The Bring&amp;ndash;Jerrard quintic is expressed as a function:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^5 - x + a\,&lt;/math&gt;
and a function &lt;math&gt;\phi(a)\,&lt;/math&gt; is to be determined such that:

:&lt;math&gt;f[\phi(a)] = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;\phi\,&lt;/math&gt; must also satisfy the following four differential equations:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{d f[\phi(a)]}{da} = 0 \\[6pt]
\frac{d^2 f[\phi(a)]}{da^2} = 0 \\[6pt]
\frac{d^3 f[\phi(a)]}{da^3} = 0 \\[6pt]
\frac{d^4 f[\phi(a)]}{da^4} = 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding these and combining them together yields the differential resolvent:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{(256 - 3125a^4)}{1155}\frac{d^4\phi}{da^4} - \frac{6250a^3}{231}\frac{d^3\phi}{da^3} - \frac{4875a^2}{77}\frac{d^2\phi}{da^2} - \frac{2125a}{77}\frac{d\phi}{da} + \phi = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

The solution of the differential resolvent, being a fourth order ordinary differential equation, depends on four [[constants of integration]], which should be chosen so as to satisfy the original quintic. This is a Fuchsian ordinary differential equation of hypergeometric type,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Doyle–McMullen iteration===
In 1989, Peter Doyle and Curt McMullen derived an iteration method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | title = Solving the quintic by iteration

:&lt;math&gt;x^5 - 10Cx^3 + 45C^2x - C^2 = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
The iteration algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Set &lt;math&gt;Z = 1 - 1728C\,&lt;/math&gt;

2. Compute the rational function
:: &lt;math&gt;T_Z(w) = w - 12\frac{g(Z,w)}{g'(Z,w)}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;g(Z,w)\,&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial function given below, and &lt;math&gt;g'\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;g(Z,w)\,&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;w\,&lt;/math&gt;
3. Iterate &lt;math&gt;T_Z[T_Z(w)]\,&lt;/math&gt; on a random starting guess until it converges. Call the [[limit point]] &lt;math&gt;w_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;w_2 = T_Z(w_1)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
4. Compute
::&lt;math&gt;\mu_i = \frac{100Z(Z-1)h(Z,w_i)}{g(Z, w_i)}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;h(Z,w)\,&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial function given below. Do this for both &lt;math&gt;w_1\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_2 = T_Z(w_1)\,&lt;/math&gt;.
5. Finally, compute
::&lt;math&gt;x_i = \frac{(9 + \sqrt{15}{\mathrm{i}})\mu_i + (9 - \sqrt{15}{\mathrm{i}})\mu_{3-i}}{90}&lt;/math&gt;
:for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2. These are two of the roots of the Brioschi quintic.

The two polynomial functions &lt;math&gt;g(Z,w)\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h(Z,w)\,&lt;/math&gt; are as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
g(Z,w) = {} &amp; 91125Z^6 \\
&amp; {} + (-133650w^2 + 61560w - 193536)Z^5 \\
&amp; {} + (-66825w^4 + 142560w^3 + 133056w^2 - 61140w + 102400)Z^4 \\
&amp; {} + (5940w^6 + 4752w^5 + 63360w^4 - 140800w^3)Z^3 \\
&amp; {} + (-1485w^8 + 3168w^7 - 10560w^6)Z^2 \\
&amp; {} + (-66w^{10} + 440w^9)Z \\
&amp; {} + w^{12} \\[8pt]
h(Z,w) = {} &amp; (1215w - 648)Z^4 \\
&amp; {} + (-540w^3 - 216w^2 - 1152w + 640)Z^3 \\
&amp; {} + (378w^5 - 504w^4 + 960w^3)Z^2 \\
&amp; {} + (36w^7 - 168w^6)Z \\
&amp; {} + w^9
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This iteration method produces two roots of the quintic. The remaining three roots can be obtained by using [[synthetic division]] to divide the two roots out, producing a cubic equation. It is to be noted that due to the way the iteration is formulated, this method seems to always find two [[complex conjugate]] roots of the quintic even when all the quintic coefficients are real and the starting guess is real. This iteration method is derived by from the symmetries of the [[icosahedron]] and is closely related to the method Felix Klein describes in his book.&lt;ref name="klein"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1670">In [[differential equations]], the ''m''th-degree '''caloric polynomial''' (or '''heat polynomial''') is a "parabolically ''m''-homogeneous" polynomial ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''t'') that satisfies the [[heat equation]]

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial x^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

"Parabolically ''m''-homogeneous" means

: &lt;math&gt; P(\lambda x, \lambda^2 t) = \lambda^m P(x,t)\text{ for }\lambda &gt; 0.\, &lt;/math&gt;

The polynomial is given by

: &lt;math&gt; P_m(x,t) = \sum_{\ell=0}^{\lfloor m/2 \rfloor} \frac{m!}{\ell!(m - 2\ell)!} x^{m - 2\ell} t^\ell. &lt;/math&gt;

It is unique [[up to]] a factor.

With ''t'' = &amp;minus;1, this polynomial reduces to the ''m''th-degree [[Hermite polynomial]] in ''x''.

Cayley in 1848 went to Dublin to attend lectures on [[quaternion]]s by Hamilton, their discoverer. Later Cayley impressed him by being the second to publish work on them.&lt;ref name=Crilly_1&gt;{{harvnb|Crilly|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cayley proved the theorem for matrices of dimension 3 and less,  publishing proof for the two-dimensional case.&lt;ref name=Cayley_1&gt;{{harvnb|Cayley|1858|pp=17–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cayley|1889|pp=475–496}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices, Cayley stated “..., I have not thought it necessary to undertake the labor of a formal proof
of the theorem in the general case of a matrix of any degree”.]]
[[File:William Rowan Hamilton portrait oval combined.png|225px|thumb|right|[[William Rowan Hamilton]] (1805–1865), Irish physicist, astronomer, and mathematician, first foreign member of the American [[National Academy of Sciences]]. While maintaining opposing position about how geometry should be studied, Hamilton always remained on the best terms with Cayley.&lt;ref name=Crilly_1/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hamilton proved that for a linear function of [[quaternion]]s there exists a certain equation, depending on the linear function, that is satisfied by the linear function itself.&lt;ref name=Hamilton_1864a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamilton_1864b/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamilton_1862/&gt;]]

In [[linear algebra]], the '''Cayley–Hamilton theorem''' (named after the mathematicians [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[William Rowan Hamilton]]) states that every [[square matrix]] over a [[commutative ring]] (such as the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] [[field (mathematics)|field]]) satisfies its own [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic equation]].

If {{mvar|A}} is a given {{math|''n''&amp;times;''n''}} matrix and {{math|''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''}} is the  {{math|''n''&amp;times;''n''}} [[identity matrix]], then the  [[characteristic polynomial]] of {{mvar|A}} is defined as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|MacDonald|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;p(\lambda)=\det(\lambda I_n-A)~,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|det}} is the [[determinant]] operation and &amp;lambda; is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] element of the base ring. Since the entries of the matrix are (linear or constant) polynomials in {{mvar|λ}}, the determinant is also an {{mvar|n}}-th order [[monic polynomial]] in {{mvar|λ}}. The Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that substituting the matrix {{mvar|A}} for {{mvar|λ}} in this polynomial results in the [[zero matrix]],
::&lt;math&gt;p(A)= O.&lt;/math&gt;

The powers of {{mvar|A}}, obtained by substitution from powers of {{mvar|λ}}, are defined by repeated matrix multiplication; the constant term of {{math| ''p''(''λ'')}} gives a multiple of the power {{mvar|A}}&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, which is defined as the identity matrix.
The theorem allows {{mvar|A}}&lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|n}}&lt;/sup&gt; to be expressed as a linear combination of the lower matrix powers of {{mvar|A}}. When the ring is a field, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem is equivalent to the statement that the [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] of a square matrix [[Polynomial division|divides]] its characteristic polynomial.

The theorem was first proved in 1853&lt;ref name=Hamilton_1853&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1853|p=562}}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of inverses of linear functions of [[quaternion]]s, a ''non-commutative'' ring, by Hamilton.&lt;ref name=Hamilton_1864a&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1864a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamilton_1864b&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1864b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamilton_1862&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1862}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to the special case of certain {{math|4 × 4}} real or {{math|2 × 2}} complex matrices. The theorem holds for general quaternionic matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zhang|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Due to the non-commutative nature of the multiplication operation for quaternions and related constructions, care needs to be taken with definitions, most notably in this context, for the determinant. The theorem holds as well for the slightly less well-behaved [[split-quaternion]]s, see {{harvtxt|Alagös|Oral|Yüce|2012}}. The rings of quaternions and split-quaternions can both be represented by certain {{math|2 × 2}} complex matrices. (When restricted to unit norm, these are the groups {{math|SU(2)}} and {{math|SU(1, 1)}} respectively.) Therefore it is not surprising that the theorem holds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no such matrix representation for the [[octonion]]s, since the multiplication operation is not associative in this case. However, a modified Cayley-Hamilton theorem still holds for the octonions, see {{harvtxt|Tian|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cayley in 1858 stated it for {{math|3 × 3}} and smaller matrices, but only published a proof for the {{math|2 × 2}} case.&lt;ref name=Cayley_1/&gt; The general case was first proved by [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]] in 1878.&lt;ref name="Frobenius 1878"&gt;{{harvnb|Frobenius|1878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== {{math|1×1}} matrices ===

For a {{math|1×1}} matrix {{math|''A''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, the characteristic polynomial is given by {{math|''p''(λ)&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''λ''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''}}, and so {{math|''p''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;(''a'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;0}} is obvious.

=== {{math|2×2}} matrices ===

As a concrete example, let
:&lt;math&gt;A = \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;2\\3&amp;4\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
Its characteristic polynomial is given by
:&lt;math&gt;p(\lambda)=\det(\lambda I_2-A)=\det\begin{pmatrix}\lambda-1&amp;-2\\
-3&amp;\lambda-4\end{pmatrix}=(\lambda-1)(\lambda-4)-(-2)(-3)=\lambda^2-5\lambda-2.&lt;/math&gt;

The Cayley–Hamilton theorem claims that, if we ''define''
:&lt;math&gt;p(X)=X^2-5X-2I_2,&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;p(A)=A^2-5A-2I_2=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0\\0&amp;0\\\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
We can verify by computation that indeed,
:&lt;math&gt;A^2-5A-2I_2=\begin{pmatrix}7&amp;10\\15&amp;22\\\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}5&amp;10\\15&amp;20\\\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}2&amp;0\\0&amp;2\\\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0\\0&amp;0\\\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a generic {{math|2×2}} matrix,
:&lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix}a&amp;b\\c&amp;d\\\end{pmatrix} ,&lt;/math&gt;

the characteristic polynomial is given by {{math| ''p''(''λ'')&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''λ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''d'')''λ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''ad''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''bc'')}}, so the Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that
:&lt;math&gt;p(A)=A^2-(a+d)A+(ad-bc)I_2=\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0\\0&amp;0\\\end{pmatrix};&lt;/math&gt;
which is indeed always the case, evident by working out the entries of {{mvar|A}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Applications==

===Determinant and inverse matrix===
{{see also|Determinant#Relation to eigenvalues and trace|Characteristic polynomial#Properties}}
For a general {{math|''n''×''n''}} [[invertible matrix]] {{mvar|A}}, i.e., one with nonzero determinant, {{mvar|A}}&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; can thus be written as an {{nowrap|{{math|(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)}}-th}} order  [[polynomial expression]] in {{mvar|A}}:   As indicated,  the Cayley–Hamilton theorem amounts to  the identity {{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation =  &lt;math&gt;p(A)=A^n+c_{n-1}A^{n-1}+\cdots+c_1A+(-1)^n\det(A)I_n =O.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6

|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}

The coefficients {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are given by the [[elementary symmetric polynomials]] of the eigenvalues of {{mvar|A}}. Using [[Newton identities]], the elementary symmetric polynomials can in turn be expressed in terms of [[power sum symmetric polynomial]]s of the eigenvalues: 
:&lt;math&gt;s_k = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i^k = \operatorname{tr}(A^k),&lt;/math&gt; 
where {{math|tr (''A''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the matrix {{mvar|A&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Thus, we can express {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in terms of the trace of powers of {{mvar|A}}.

In general, the formula for the coefficients {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is given in terms of complete exponential [[Bell polynomials]] as  &lt;ref group=nb&gt;An explicit expression for these coefficients is
:&lt;math&gt;c_i = \sum_{ k_1,k_2,\ldots ,k_n}\prod_{l=1}^{n} \frac{(-1)^{k_l+1}}{l^{k_l} k_l!}\operatorname{tr}(A^l)^{k_l},&lt;/math&gt;
where the sum is taken over the sets of all integer partitions {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0}} satisfying the equation 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{l=1}^{n}lk_{l} = n-i.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; c_{n-k} = \frac{(-1)^{k}}{k!} B_k(s_1, -1! s_2, 2! s_3, \ldots, (-1)^{k-1}(k-1)! s_k).&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, the determinant of {{math|''A''}} corresponds to  {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Thus, the determinant can be written as a [[trace identity]]
:&lt;math&gt;\det(A) = \frac{1}{n!} B_n(s_1, -1! s_2, 2! s_3, \ldots, (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)! s_n).&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the characteristic polynomial can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;-(-1)^n\det(A)I_n = A(A^{n-1}+c_{n-1}A^{n-2}+\cdots+c_{1}I_n),&lt;/math&gt;
and, by  multiplying both sides by {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} (note {{math|−(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}), one is led to an expression for the inverse of {{math|''A''}} as a trace identity,
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
A^{-1} &amp; = \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{\det A}(A^{n-1}+c_{n-1}A^{n-2}+\cdots+c_{1}I_n), \\
 &amp; = \frac{1}{\det A}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^{n+k-1}\frac{A^{n-k-1}}{k!} B_k(s_1, -1! s_2, 2! s_3, \ldots, (-1)^{k-1}(k-1)! s_k). 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the first few Bell polynomials are {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 1, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''x''{{su|b=1|p=2}} + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''x''{{su|b=1|p=3}} + 3 ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Using these to specify the coefficients {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of the characteristic polynomial of a {{math|2×2}} matrix yields
:&lt;math&gt;c_2 = B_0 = 1, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_1 =  \frac{-1}{1!} B_1(s_1) = - s_1 = - \operatorname{tr}(A),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_0 =  \frac{1}{2!} B_2(s_1, -1! s_2) = \frac{1}{2}(s_1^2 - s_2) = \frac{1}{2}((\operatorname{tr}(A))^2 - \operatorname{tr}(A^2)).&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficient {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} gives the determinant of the {{math|2×2}} matrix, {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} minus its trace, while its inverse is given by
:&lt;math&gt; A^{-1} = \frac{-1}{\det A}(A + c_1 I_2) = \frac{-2(A - \operatorname{tr}(A) I_2)}{(\operatorname{tr}(A))^2 - \operatorname{tr}(A^2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is apparent from the general formula for ''c&lt;sub&gt;n-k&lt;/sub&gt;'', expressed in terms of Bell polynomials, that the expressions
:&lt;math&gt;-\operatorname{tr}(A)\quad&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\quad \tfrac 1 2 (\operatorname{tr}(A)^2 - \operatorname{tr}(A^2))&lt;/math&gt;

always give the coefficients {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and  {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in the characteristic polynomial of any {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrix, respectively. So, for a {{math|3×3}} matrix {{mvar|A}}, the statement of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem can also be written as
:&lt;math&gt;A^3- (\operatorname{tr}A)A^2+\frac{1}{2}\left((\operatorname{tr}A)^2-\operatorname{tr}(A^2)\right)A-\det(A)I_3=O,&lt;/math&gt;
where the right-hand side designates a {{math|3×3}} matrix with all entries reduced to zero. Likewise, this determinant in the {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;3}} case, is  now
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\det(A) &amp;= \frac{1}{3!} B_3(s_1, -1! s_2, 2! s_3) =  \frac{1}{6}(s_1^3 + 3 s_1 (-s_2) + 2 s_3) \\
 &amp;= \tfrac{1}{6} \left ( (\operatorname{tr}A)^3-3\operatorname{tr}(A^2)(\operatorname{tr}A)+2\operatorname{tr}(A^3) \right ). 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
This expression gives the negative of coefficient {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−3&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''λ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−3&lt;/sup&gt;}} in the general case, as seen below.

Similarly, one can write for a {{math|4×4}} matrix {{mvar|A}},
:&lt;math&gt; A^4-(\operatorname{tr}A)A^3 + \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl((\operatorname{tr}A)^2-\operatorname{tr}(A^2)\bigr)A^2 - \tfrac{1}{6}\bigl( (\operatorname{tr}A)^3-3\operatorname{tr}(A^2)(\operatorname{tr}A)+2\operatorname{tr}(A^3)\bigr)A + \det(A)I_4 = O,&lt;/math&gt;
where, now,  the determinant is  {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, 
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{24} \left ( (\operatorname{tr}A)^4-6 \operatorname{tr}(A^2)(\operatorname{tr}A)^2+3(\operatorname{tr}(A^2))^2+8\operatorname{tr}(A^3)\operatorname{tr}(A) -6\operatorname{tr}(A^4) \right ),&lt;/math&gt;
and so on for larger matrices. The increasingly complex expressions for the coefficients  {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is deducible from [[Newton's identities]] or the [[Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm]].

Another method for obtaining these coefficients  {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for a general {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrix, provided no root be zero, relies on the following alternative [[Matrix exponential#The determinant of the matrix exponential|expression for the determinant]],
:&lt;math&gt; p(\lambda)= \det (\lambda I_n -A) = \lambda^n \exp (\operatorname{tr} (\log (I_n - A/\lambda))). &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, by virtue of the [[Mercator series]],
:&lt;math&gt;p(\lambda)= \lambda^n \exp \left( -\operatorname{tr} \sum_{m=1}^\infty {({A\over\lambda})^m \over m}  \right),&lt;/math&gt;
where the exponential ''only'' needs be expanded to order  {{math|''λ''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, since {{math|''p''(''λ'')}} is of order {{math|''n''}}, the net negative powers of {{math|''λ''}} automatically vanishing by the C–H theorem. (Again, this requires a ring containing the rational numbers.) The coefficients of {{mvar|λ}} can be directly written in terms of complete [[Bell polynomial]]s by comparing this expression with the generating function of the Bell polynomial.

Differentiation of this expression with respect to {{mvar|λ}} allows determination of the generic coefficients of the characteristic polynomial for general {{mvar|n}}, as
determinants of {{math|''m''×''m''}} matrices,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;See, e.g., p.&amp;nbsp;54 of  {{harvnb|Brown|1994}}, which solves [[Jacobi's formula]], 
:&lt;math&gt;\partial p(\lambda)  /\partial \lambda= p(\lambda) \sum^\infty _{m=0}\lambda ^{-(m+1)}  \operatorname{tr}A^m =  p(\lambda) ~  \operatorname{tr} \frac{I}{\lambda I -A}\equiv\operatorname{tr} B~, &lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|B}} is the adjugate matrix of the next section.

There also exists an equivalent, related recursive algorithm introduced by [[Urbain Le Verrier]] and [[Dmitry Konstantinovich Faddeev]]—the [[Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm]], which reads
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
M_0 &amp;\equiv O      &amp; c_n &amp;= 1                                                               \qquad &amp;(k=0) \\
M_k &amp;\equiv AM_{k-1}  -\frac{1}{k-1}(\operatorname{tr}(AM_{k-1})) I \qquad \qquad  &amp; c_{n-k} &amp;= -\frac 1 k \operatorname{tr}(AM_k) \qquad &amp;k=1,\ldots ,n   ~.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
(see, e.g., p 88 of {{harvnb|Gantmacher|1960}}.)  Observe {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; /''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} as the recursion terminates.
See the algebraic proof in the following section, which relies on the modes of the adjugate, {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} .  &amp;nbsp;
Specifically, &lt;math&gt;(\lambda I-A) B = I p(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; and the above derivative of {{mvar|p}}   when one traces it yields
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda p' -n p =\operatorname{tr} (AB)~,&lt;/math&gt; ({{harvnb|Hou|1998}}), and the above recursions, in turn.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_{n-m} = \frac{(-1)^m}{m!}
\begin{vmatrix}  \operatorname{tr}A  &amp;   m-1 &amp;0&amp;\cdots\\
\operatorname{tr}A^2  &amp;\operatorname{tr}A&amp;   m-2 &amp;\cdots\\
 \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; &amp; \vdots    \\
\operatorname{tr}A^{m-1} &amp;\operatorname{tr}A^{m-2}&amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; 1    \\
\operatorname{tr}A^m  &amp;\operatorname{tr}A^{m-1}&amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \operatorname{tr}A \end{vmatrix} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

===''n''-th Power of matrix===
The Cayley–Hamilton theorem always provides a relationship between the powers of {{mvar|A}} (though not always the simplest one), which allows one to simplify expressions involving such powers, and evaluate them without having to compute the power {{math|A&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} or any higher powers of {{mvar|A}}.

As an example, for &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;2\\3&amp;4\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; the theorem gives 
:&lt;math&gt;A^2=5A+2I_2\,  .&lt;/math&gt;

Then, to calculate {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, observe
:&lt;math&gt;A^3=(5A+2I_2)A=5A^2+2A=5(5A+2I_2)+2A=27A+10I_2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A^4=A^3A=(27A+10I_2)A=27A^2+10A=27(5A+2I_2)+10A=145A+54I_2\, .&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise,
:&lt;math&gt;A^{-1}=\frac{A-5I_2}{2}~.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that we have been able to write the matrix power as the sum of two terms. In fact, matrix power of any order {{math|''k''}} can be written as a matrix polynomial of degree at most {{math|''n -'' 1}}, where {{math|''n''}} is the size of a square matrix. This is an instance where Cayley–Hamilton theorem can be used to express a matrix function, which we will discuss below systematically.

===Matrix functions===
Given an analytic function 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k x^k&lt;/math&gt;
and the characteristic polynomial {{math|''p''(''x'')}}  of degree {{math|''n''}} of an {{math|''n × n''}} matrix {{mvar|A}}, the function can be expressed using long division as 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = q(x) p(x) + r(x),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''q''(''x'')}} is some quotient polynomial and  {{math|''r''(''x'')}} is a remainder polynomial such that {{math|0 ≤ ''deg'' ''r''(''x'') &lt; ''n''}}. By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, replacing {{mvar|x}} by the matrix {{mvar|A}} gives {{math|1=''p''(''A'') = 0}}, so one has
:&lt;math&gt;f(A) = r(A). &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the analytic function of matrix {{mvar|''A''}} can be expressed as a matrix polynomial of degree less than {{mvar|''n''}}.

Let the remainder polynomial be
:&lt;math&gt;r(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_{n-1} x^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since {{math|1=''p''(''λ'') = 0}}, evaluating the function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} at the {{math|''n''}} eigenvalues of {{math|''A''}},  yields
:&lt;math&gt; f(\lambda_i) = r(\lambda_i) = c_0 + c_1 \lambda_i + \cdots + c_{n-1} \lambda_i^{n-1}, \qquad \mathrm{for} \qquad i=1,2,...,n.&lt;/math&gt;
This amounts to a system of {{math|''n''}} linear equations, which can be solved to determine the coefficients {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Thus, one has 
:&lt;math&gt;f(A) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k A^k.&lt;/math&gt;

When the eigenvalues are repeated, that is {{math|1=''λ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for some {{math|''i ≠ j''}}, two or more equations are identical; and hence the linear equations cannot be solved uniquely. For such cases, for an eigenvalue {{math|''λ''}} with multiplicity {{math|''m''}}, the first {{math|''m'' – 1}} derivative of {{math|''p(x)''}} vanishes at the eigenvalues. Thus, there are the extra {{math|''m'' – 1}} linearly independent solutions 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^{k}f(x)}{\mathrm{d}x^k}\Big|_{x=\lambda} = \frac{\mathrm{d}^{k}r(x)}{\mathrm{d}x^k}\Big|_{x=\lambda}\qquad \mathrm{for} \qquad k = 1, 2, \ldots, m-1,&lt;/math&gt;
which, when combined with others, yield the required {{math|''n''}} equations to solve for {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

Finding a polynomial that passes through the points {{math|(''λ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''f'' (''λ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''))}} is essentially an [[polynomial interpolation|interpolation problem]], and can be solved using [[Lagrange interpolation|Lagrange]] or [[Newton polynomial|Newton interpolation]] techniques,  leading to  [[Sylvester's formula]].

For example, suppose the task is to find the polynomial representation of 
:&lt;math&gt;f(A) = e^{At} \qquad \mathrm{where} \qquad A = \begin{pmatrix}1&amp;2\\0&amp;3\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The characteristic polynomial is {{math|1=''p(x) = (x - 1)(x - 3) = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 4 x + 3''}}, and the eigenvalues are {{math|1=''λ = 1, 3''}}. Let {{math|1=''r(x) = c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x''}}. Evaluating {{math|1=''f(λ) = r(λ)''}} at the eigenvalues, one obtains two linear equations {{math|1=''e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|1=''e&lt;sup&gt;3t&lt;/sup&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Solving the equations yields {{math|1=''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (3 e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt; - e&lt;sup&gt;3t&lt;/sup&gt;)/2''}} and {{math|1=''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (e&lt;sup&gt;3t&lt;/sup&gt; - e&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;)/2''}}. Thus, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;e^{At} = c_0 I_2 + c_1 A = \begin{pmatrix}c_0 + c_1 &amp; 2 c_1\\ 0 &amp; c_0 + 3 c_1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}e^{t} &amp; e^{3t} - e^{t} \\ 0 &amp; e^{3t}\end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

If, instead, the function were {{math|1=''f(A) = sin At''}}, then the coefficients would have been {{math|1=''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (3 sin t - sin 3t)/2''}} and {{math|1=''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (sin 3t - sin t)/2''}}; hence
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(At) = c_0 I_2 + c_1 A = \begin{pmatrix}\sin t &amp; \sin 3t - \sin t \\ 0 &amp; \sin 3t\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a further example, when considering
:&lt;math&gt;f(A) = e^{At} \qquad \mathrm{where} \qquad A = \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 1\\-1 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
then the characteristic polynomial is {{math|1=''p(x) = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1''}}, and the eigenvalues are {{math|1=''λ = i, -i''}}. As before, evaluating the function at the eigenvalues gives us the linear equations {{math|1=''e&lt;sup&gt;it&lt;/sup&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + i c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|1=''e&lt;sup&gt;−it&lt;/sup&gt; = c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; - i c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''}}; the solution of which gives, {{math|1=''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (e&lt;sup&gt;it&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−it&lt;/sup&gt;)/2 = cos t''}} and {{math|1=''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (e&lt;sup&gt;it&lt;/sup&gt; - e&lt;sup&gt;−it&lt;/sup&gt;)/2i = sin t''}}. Thus, for this case,
:&lt;math&gt;e^{At} = (\cos t) I_2 + (\sin t) A =  \begin{pmatrix}\cos t &amp; \sin t\\ -\sin t &amp; \cos t \end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
which is a [[rotation matrix]].

Standard examples of such usage is the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] from the [[Lie algebra]] of a [[matrix Lie group]] into the group. It is given by a [[matrix exponential]],
:&lt;math&gt;\exp: \mathfrak g \rightarrow G;
\qquad tX \mapsto e^{tX} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{t^nX^n}{n!} = I + tX + \frac{t^2X^2}{2} + \cdots, t \in \mathbb R, X \in \mathfrak g .&lt;/math&gt;
Such expressions have long been known for {{math|SU(2)}},
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i(\theta/2)(\hat n \cdot \sigma)} = I_2 \cos \theta/2 + i(\hat n \cdot \sigma) \sin \theta/2,&lt;/math&gt;
where the {{mvar|σ}} are the [[Pauli matrices]] and for {{math|SO(3)}},
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta(\hat n \cdot \mathbf J)} = I_3 +  i(\hat n \cdot \mathbf J) \sin \theta  + (\hat n \cdot \mathbf J)^2 (\cos \theta - 1),&lt;/math&gt;
which is [[Rodrigues' rotation formula]]. For the notation, see [[rotation group SO(3)#A note on Lie algebra]].

More recently, expressions have appeared for other groups, like the [[Lorentz group]] {{math|SO(3, 1)}},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeni|Rodrigues|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|O(4, 2)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barut|Zeni|Laufer|1994a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{math|SU(2, 2)}},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barut|Zeni|Laufer|1994b}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as {{math|GL(''n'', '''R''')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laufer|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group {{math|O(4, 2)}} is the [[conformal group]] of [[spacetime]], {{math|SU(2, 2)}} its [[simply connected]] cover (to be precise, the simply connected cover of the [[connected component (topology)|connected component]] {{math|SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(4, 2)}} of {{math|O(4, 2)}}). The expressions obtained apply to the standard representation of these groups. They require knowledge of (some of) the [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix to exponentiate. For {{math|SU(2)}} (and hence for {{math|SO(3)}}), closed expressions have recently been obtained for all irreducible representations, i.e. of any spin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtright|Fairlie|Zachos|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His main interests were [[elliptic function]]s [[differential equation]]s, and later [[group theory]].&lt;br/&gt;In 1878 he gave the first full proof of the Cayley&amp;ndash;Hamilton theorem.&lt;ref name="Frobenius 1878"/&gt;]]

===Algebraic Number Theory===
The Cayley–Hamilton theorem is an effective tool for computing the minimal polynomial of algebraic integers. For example, given a finite extension &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}[\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k]&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; and an algebraic integer &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb{Q}[\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k]&lt;/math&gt; which is a non-zero linear combination of the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1^{n_1}\cdots\alpha_k^{n_k}&lt;/math&gt; we can compute the minimal polynomial of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; by finding a matrix representing the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;-linear transformation
:&lt;math&gt;\cdot \alpha : \mathbb{Q}[\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k] \to \mathbb{Q}[\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k]&lt;/math&gt;
If we call this transformation matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then we can find the minimal polynomial by applying the Cayley–Hamilton theorem to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stein|first1=William|title=Algebraic Number Theory, a Computational Approach|pages=29|url=http://wstein.org/books/ant/ant.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proving the theorem in general ==
The Cayley-Hamilton is an immediate consequence of the existence of the [[Jordan normal form]] for matrices over [[Algebraically closed field|algebraically closed fields]]. In this section direct proofs are presented. 

As the examples above show, obtaining the statement of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem for an {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrix

:&lt;math&gt;A=(a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^n&lt;/math&gt;
requires two steps: first the coefficients {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the characteristic polynomial are determined by development as a polynomial in {{math|''t''}} of the determinant

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
p(t) &amp; = \det(t I_n - A) =
\begin{vmatrix}t-a_{1,1}&amp;-a_{1,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;-a_{1,n} \\
-a_{2,1}&amp;t-a_{2,2}&amp;\cdots&amp;-a_{2,n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
-a_{n,1}&amp;-a_{n,2}&amp; \cdots&amp; t-a_{n,n} \end{vmatrix} \\
&amp; = t^n+c_{n-1}t^{n-1}+\cdots+c_1t+c_0,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and then these coefficients are used in a linear combination of powers of {{math|''A''}} that is equated to the {{math|''n''×''n''}} null matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;A^n+c_{n-1}A^{n-1} + \cdots + c_1 A + c_0 I_n = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The left hand side can be worked out to an {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrix whose entries are (enormous) polynomial expressions in the set of entries {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''A''}}, so the Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that each of these {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} expressions are equal to {{math|0}}. For any fixed value of {{math|''n''}} these identities can be obtained by tedious but completely straightforward algebraic manipulations. None of these computations can show however why the Cayley–Hamilton theorem should be valid for matrices of all possible sizes {{math|''n''}}, so a uniform proof for all {{math|''n''}} is needed.

=== Preliminaries ===
If a vector {{math|''v''}} of size {{math|''n''}} happens to be an [[eigenvector]] of {{math|''A''}} with eigenvalue {{math|''λ''}}, in other words if {{math|''A''⋅''v'' {{=}} ''λv''}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p(A)\cdot v &amp; = A^n\cdot v+c_{n-1}A^{n-1}\cdot v+\cdots+c_1A\cdot v+c_0I_n\cdot v \\[6pt]
&amp; = \lambda^nv+c_{n-1}\lambda^{n-1}v+\cdots+c_1\lambda v+c_0 v=p(\lambda)v,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which is the null vector since {{math|''p''(''λ'') {{=}} 0}} (the eigenvalues of {{math|''A''}} are precisely the [[root of a function|root]]s of {{math|''p''(''t'')}}). This holds for all possible eigenvalues {{math|''λ''}}, so the two matrices equated by the theorem certainly give the same (null) result when applied to any eigenvector. Now if {{math|''A''}} admits a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of eigenvectors, in other words if {{math|''A''}} is [[diagonalizable]], then the Cayley–Hamilton theorem must hold for {{math|''A''}}, since two matrices that give the same values when applied to each element of a basis must be equal. 
:&lt;math&gt;A=XDX^{-1}, \quad D=\operatorname{diag}(\lambda_i), \quad i=1,2,...,n
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_A(\lambda)=|\lambda I-A|=&lt;/math&gt; product  of  eigenvalues  of &lt;math&gt;\lambda I -A=\prod_{i=1}^n (\lambda-\lambda_i)\equiv \sum_{k=0}^n c_k\lambda^k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_A(A)=\sum c_k A^k=X p_A(D)X^{-1}=X C X^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_{ii}=\sum_{k=0}^n c_k\lambda_i^k=\prod_{j=1}^n(\lambda_i-\lambda_j)=0, \qquad C_{i,j\neq i}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\therefore p_A(A)=XCX^{-1}=O .&lt;/math&gt;

Consider now the function &lt;math&gt;e: M_n \to M_n&lt;/math&gt;which maps &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt;matrices to &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt;matrices given by the formula &lt;math&gt;e(A)=p_{A}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. which takes a matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;and plugs it into its own characteristic polynomial. Not all matrices are diagonalizable, but for matrices with complex coefficients many of them are: the set of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; diagonalizable complex square matrices of a given size is [[dense set|dense]] in the set of all such square matrices&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bhatia|1997|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for a matrix to be diagonalizable it suffices for instance that its characteristic polynomial not have any multiple roots).  Now viewed as a function  &lt;math&gt;e:\mathbb{C}^{n^2}\to \mathbb {C} ^{n^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;(since matrices have &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;entries) we see that this function is [[Continuous function|continuous]]. This is true because the entries of the image of a matrix are given by polynomials in the entries of the matrix. Since  

&lt;math&gt;e(D) = \left\{\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; 

and since &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;is dense, by continuity this function must map the entire set of &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt;matrices to the zero matrix. Therefore the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is true for complex numbers, and must therefore also hold for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt;or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;valued matrices..

While this provides a valid proof,  the argument is not very satisfactory, since the identities represented by the theorem do not in any way depend on the nature of the matrix (diagonalizable or not), nor on the kind of entries allowed (for matrices with real entries the diagonalizable ones do not form a dense set, and it seems strange one would have to consider complex matrices to see that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for them). We shall therefore now consider only arguments that prove the theorem directly for any matrix using algebraic manipulations only; these also have the benefit of working for matrices with entries in any [[commutative ring]].

There is a great variety of such proofs of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, of which several will be given here. They vary in the amount of abstract algebraic notions required to understand the proof. The simplest proofs use just those notions needed to formulate the theorem (matrices, polynomials with numeric entries, determinants), but involve technical computations that render somewhat mysterious the fact that they lead precisely to the correct conclusion. It is possible to avoid such details, but at the price of involving more subtle algebraic notions: polynomials with coefficients in a non-commutative ring, or matrices with unusual kinds of entries.

==== Adjugate matrices ====
All proofs below use the notion of the [[adjugate matrix]] {{math|adj(''M'')}} of an {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrix {{math|''M''}}, the [[transpose]] of its [[Minor (linear algebra)|cofactor matrix]].

This is a matrix whose coefficients are given  by polynomial expressions in the coefficients of {{math|''M''}} (in fact, by certain {{math|(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)×(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)}} determinants), in such a way that 
the following fundamental relations hold,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{adj}(M)\cdot M=\det(M)I_n=M\cdot\operatorname{adj}(M)~.&lt;/math&gt;
These relations are a direct consequence of the basic properties of determinants: evaluation of the {{math|(''i'',''j'')}} entry of the matrix product on the left gives the expansion by column {{math|''j''}} of the determinant of the matrix obtained from {{math|''M''}} by replacing column {{math|''i''}} by a copy of column {{math|''j''}}, which is {{math|det(''M'')}} if {{math|''i'' {{=}} ''j''}} and zero otherwise; the matrix product on the right is similar, but for expansions by rows.

Being a consequence of just algebraic expression manipulation, these relations are valid for matrices with entries in any commutative ring (commutativity must be assumed for determinants to be defined in the first place). This is important to note here, because these relations will be applied below for matrices with non-numeric entries such as polynomials.

=== A direct algebraic proof ===
This proof uses just the kind of objects needed to formulate the Cayley–Hamilton theorem: matrices with polynomials as entries. The matrix {{math|''t I''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; −''A''}} whose determinant is the characteristic polynomial of {{mvar|A}} is such a matrix, and since polynomials form a commutative ring, it has an [[Adjugate matrix|adjugate]]
:&lt;math&gt;B=\operatorname{adj}(tI_n-A).&lt;/math&gt;
Then, according to the right-hand fundamental relation of the adjugate, one has
:&lt;math&gt;(t I_n - A)B = \det(t I_n - A) I_n = p(t) I_n~.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''B''}} is also a matrix with polynomials in  {{math|''t''}} as entries, one can, for each  {{math|''i''}} , collect the coefficients of  {{math|''t&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} in each entry to form a matrix  {{math|''B'' &lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of numbers, such that one has
:&lt;math&gt;B = \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} t^i B_i   ~.&lt;/math&gt;
(The way the entries of  {{math|''B''}} are defined makes clear that no powers higher than {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} occur). While this ''looks'' like a polynomial with matrices as coefficients, we shall not consider such a notion; it is just a way to write a matrix with polynomial entries as a linear combination of {{mvar|n}} constant matrices, and the coefficient  {{math|''t &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} has been written to the left of the matrix to stress this point of view.

Now, one can expand the matrix product in our equation by bilinearity
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 p(t) I_n &amp;= (t I_n - A)B \\
 &amp;=(t I_n - A)\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} t^i B_i  \\
 &amp;=\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} tI_n\cdot t^i B_i - \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} A\cdot t^i B_i \\
 &amp;=\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} t^{i + 1}  B_i- \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} t^i AB_i  \\
 &amp;=t^n B_{n - 1} + \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}  t^i(B_{i - 1} - AB_i) - AB_0~.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Writing
:&lt;math&gt;p(t)I_n=t^nI_n+t^{n-1}c_{n-1}I_n+\cdots+tc_1I_n+c_0I_n~,&lt;/math&gt;
one obtains an equality of two matrices with polynomial entries, written as linear combinations of constant matrices with powers of  {{math|''t''}} as coefficients.

Such an equality can hold only if in any matrix position the entry that is multiplied by a given power {{math| ''t&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}}  is the same on both sides; it follows that the constant matrices with coefficient {{math|''t&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} in both expressions must be equal. Writing these equations then for {{math|''i''}} from  {{math|''n''}} down to 0,  one finds
:&lt;math&gt;B_{n - 1} = I_n, \qquad B_{i - 1} - AB_i = c_i I_n\quad \text{for }1 \leq i \leq n-1, \qquad -A B_0 = c_0 I_n~.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, multiply the equation of the coefficients of  {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} from the left by  {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and sum up:

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;A^n B_{n-1} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}\left( A^i B_{i-1} - A^{i+1}B_i\right) -A B_0 =A^n+c_{n-1}A^{n-1}+\cdots+c_1A+c_0I_n~. &lt;/math&gt;

The left-hand sides form a [[telescoping sum]] and cancel completely; the right-hand sides add up to &lt;math&gt; p(A)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; O= p(A)~.&lt;/math&gt;
This completes the proof.

=== A proof using polynomials with matrix coefficients ===
This proof is similar to the first one, but tries to give meaning to the notion of polynomial with matrix coefficients that was suggested by the expressions occurring in that proof. This requires considerable care, since it is somewhat unusual to consider polynomials with coefficients in a non-commutative ring, and not all reasoning that is valid for commutative polynomials can be applied in this setting.

Notably, while arithmetic of polynomials over a commutative ring models the arithmetic of [[polynomial function]]s, this is not the case over a non-commutative ring (in fact there is no obvious notion of polynomial function in this case that is closed under multiplication). So when considering polynomials in {{mvar|t}} with matrix coefficients, the variable {{mvar|t}} must not be thought of as an "unknown", but as a formal symbol that is to be manipulated according to given rules; in particular one cannot just set  {{mvar|t}} to a specific value.
:&lt;math&gt;(f+g)(x) = \sum_i \left (f_i+g_i \right )x^i = \sum_i{f_i x^i} + \sum_i{g_i x^i} = f(x) + g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let ''M''(''n'', ''R'') be the ring of ''n''×''n'' matrices with entries in some ring ''R'' (such as the real or complex numbers) that has  {{mvar|A}}  as an element. Matrices with as coefficients polynomials in {{mvar|t}}, such as &lt;math&gt;tI_n - A&lt;/math&gt; or its adjugate ''B'' in the first proof, are elements of ''M''(''n'', ''R''[''t'']).

By collecting like powers of {{mvar|t}}, such matrices can be written as "polynomials" in {{mvar|t}} with constant matrices as coefficients; write ''M''(''n'', ''R'')[''t''] for the set of such polynomials. Since this set is in bijection with ''M''(''n'', ''R''[''t'']), one defines arithmetic operations on it correspondingly, in particular multiplication is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\left (\sum_iM_it^i \right )\left (\sum_jN_jt^j \right )=\sum_{i,j}(M_i N_j)t^{i+j},&lt;/math&gt;
respecting the order of the coefficient matrices from the two operands; obviously this gives a non-commutative multiplication.

Thus, the identity
:&lt;math&gt;(t I_n - A)B = p(t) I_n.&lt;/math&gt;
from the first proof can be viewed as one involving a multiplication of elements in ''M''(''n'', ''R'')[''t''].

At this point, it is tempting to simply set {{mvar|t}} equal to the matrix  {{mvar|A}} , which makes the first factor on the left equal to the null matrix, and the right hand side equal to {{math|''p''(''A'')}}; however, this is not an allowed operation when coefficients do not commute. It is possible to define a "right-evaluation map" ev&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|A}}&lt;/sub&gt; : '''M'''[''t''] → '''M''', which replaces each ''t''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; by the matrix power  {{mvar|A}}&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; of  {{mvar|A}} , where one stipulates that the power is always to be multiplied on the right to the corresponding coefficient.

But this map is not a ring homomorphism: the right-evaluation of a product differs in general from the product of the right-evaluations. This is so because multiplication of polynomials with matrix coefficients does not model multiplication of expressions containing unknowns: a product &lt;math&gt;Mt^i Nt^j = (M\cdot N)t^{i+j}&lt;/math&gt; is defined assuming that  {{mvar|t}} commutes with  {{mvar|N}}, but this may fail if {{mvar|t}} is replaced by the matrix  {{mvar|A}}.

One can work around this difficulty in the particular situation at hand, since the above right-evaluation map does become a ring homomorphism if the matrix  {{mvar|A}}  is in the [[center (algebra)|center]] of the ring of coefficients, so that it commutes with all the coefficients of the polynomials (the argument proving this is straightforward, exactly because commuting {{mvar|t}} with coefficients is now justified after evaluation).

Now, {{mvar|A}}  is not always in the center of '''M''', but we may replace '''M''' with a smaller ring provided it contains all the coefficients of the polynomials in question: &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt;,  {{mvar|A}}, and the coefficients &lt;math&gt;B_i&lt;/math&gt; of the polynomial ''B''. The obvious choice for such a subring is the [[centralizer]] ''Z'' of  {{mvar|A}}, the subring of all matrices that commute with  {{mvar|A}}; by definition  {{mvar|A}}  is in the center of ''Z''.

This centralizer obviously contains &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt;, and {{mvar|A}}, but one has to show that it contains the matrices &lt;math&gt;B_i&lt;/math&gt;. To do this, one combines the two fundamental relations for adjugates, writing out the adjugate ''B'' as a polynomial:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \left(\sum_{i = 0}^m B_i t^i\right) (t I_n - A)&amp;=(tI_n - A) \sum_{i = 0}^m B_i t^i \\
  \sum_{i = 0}^m B_i t^{i + 1} - \sum_{i = 0}^m B_i A t^i &amp;= \sum_{i = 0}^m B_i t^{i + 1} - \sum_{i = 0}^m A B_i t^i \\
 \sum_{i = 0}^m B_i A t^i &amp;= \sum_{i = 0}^m A B_i t^i .
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Equating the coefficients]] shows that for each ''i'', we have  {{mvar|A}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  {{mvar|A}}  as desired. Having found the proper setting in which ev&lt;sub&gt;{{mvar|A}}&lt;/sub&gt; is indeed a homomorphism of rings, one can complete the proof as suggested above:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \operatorname{ev}_A\bigl(p(t)I_n\bigr) &amp;= \operatorname{ev}_A((tI_n-A)B)  \\
  p(A)&amp;= \operatorname{ev}_A(tI_n - A)\cdot \operatorname{ev}_A(B) \\
  p(A) &amp;= (AI_n-A) \cdot \operatorname{ev}_A(B) = O\cdot\operatorname{ev}_A(B)=O.
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This completes the proof.

=== A synthesis of the first two  proofs ===
In the first proof, one was able to determine the coefficients  {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of  {{math|''B''}} based on the right-hand fundamental relation for the adjugate only. In fact the first {{math|''n''}} equations derived can be interpreted as determining the quotient {{math|''B''}} of the [[Euclidean division]] of the polynomial {{math|''p''(''t'')''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} on the left by the [[monic polynomial]] {{math|''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;t''−''A''}}, while the final equation expresses the fact that the remainder is zero. This division is performed in the ring of polynomials with matrix coefficients. Indeed, even over a non-commutative ring, Euclidean division by a monic polynomial  {{math|''P''}} is defined, and always produces a unique quotient and remainder with the same degree condition as in the commutative case, provided it is specified at which side one wishes {{math|''P''}} to be a factor (here that is to the left).

To see that quotient and remainder are unique (which is the important part of the statement here), it suffices to write &lt;math&gt;PQ+r=PQ'+r'&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;P(Q-Q')=r'-r&lt;/math&gt; and observe that since  {{math|''P''}} is monic, {{math|''P(Q−Q') ''}} cannot have a degree less than that of  {{math|''P''}}, unless {{math|''Q''{{=}}''Q' ''}}.

But the dividend {{math|''p''(''t'')''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and divisor {{math|''I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;t''−''A''}} used here both lie in the subring  {{math|(''R''[''A''])[''t'']}}, where  {{math|''R''[''A'']}} is the subring of the matrix ring  {{math|''M''(''n'', ''R'')}} generated by  {{math|''A''}}: the  {{math|''R''}}-linear span of all powers of   {{math|''A''}}. Therefore, the Euclidean division can in fact be performed within that ''commutative'' polynomial ring, and of course it then gives the same quotient  {{math|''B''}} and remainder 0 as in the larger ring; in particular this shows that  {{math|''B''}} in fact lies in  {{math|(''R''[''A''])[''t'']}}.

But, in this commutative setting, it is valid to set   {{math|''t''}} to  {{math|''A''}} in the equation 
:&lt;math&gt;p(t)I_n=(tI_n-A)B&lt;/math&gt;; in other words, to apply the evaluation map
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ev}_A:(R[A])[t]\to R[A]&lt;/math&gt;
which is a ring homomorphism, giving
:&lt;math&gt;p(A)=0\cdot\operatorname{ev}_A(B)=0&lt;/math&gt;
just like in the second proof, as desired.

In addition to proving the theorem, the above argument tells us that the coefficients {{math| ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of  {{math|''B''}} are polynomials in  {{math|''A''}}, while from the second proof we only knew that they lie in the centralizer  {{math|''Z''}} of  {{math|''A''}}; in general  {{math|''Z''}} is a larger subring than  {{math|''R''[''A'']}}, and not necessarily commutative. In particular the constant term {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}} adj(−''A'')}} lies in  {{math|''R''[''A'']}}. Since  {{math|''A''}} is an arbitrary square matrix, this proves that {{math|adj(''A'')}} can always be expressed as a polynomial in  {{math|''A''}} (with coefficients that depend on  {{math|''A'')}}.

In fact, the equations found in the first proof allow successively expressing &lt;math&gt;B_{n-1}, \ldots, B_1, B_0&lt;/math&gt; as polynomials in  {{math|''A''}}, which leads to the identity
{{Equation box 1

valid for all  {{math|''n''×''n''}} matrices, where 
:&lt;math&gt;p(t)=t^n+c_{n-1}t^{n-1}+\cdots+c_1t+c_0&lt;/math&gt; 
is the characteristic polynomial of  {{math|''A''}}.

Note that this identity also implies the statement of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem: one may move  {{math|adj(−''A'')}} to the right hand side, multiply the resulting equation (on the left or on the right) by  {{math|''A''}}, and use the fact that
:&lt;math&gt;-A\cdot \operatorname{adj}(-A)=\operatorname{adj}(-A)\cdot (-A)=\det(-A)I_n=c_0I_n.&lt;/math&gt;

{{see also|Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm}}

=== A proof using matrices of endomorphisms ===
As was mentioned above, the matrix ''p''(''A'') in statement of the theorem is obtained by first evaluating the determinant and then substituting the matrix ''A'' for ''t''; doing that substitution into the matrix &lt;math&gt;tI_n-A&lt;/math&gt; before evaluating the determinant is not meaningful. Nevertheless, it is possible to give an interpretation where ''p''(''A'') is obtained directly as the value of a certain determinant, but this requires a more complicated setting, one of matrices over a ring in which one can interpret both the entries &lt;math&gt;A_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; of ''A'', and all of ''A'' itself. One could take for this the ring ''M''(''n'', ''R'') of ''n''×''n'' matrices over ''R'', where the entry &lt;math&gt;A_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; is realised as &lt;math&gt;A_{i,j}I_n&lt;/math&gt;, and ''A'' as itself. But considering matrices with matrices as entries might cause confusion with [[block matrix|block matrices]], which is not intended, as that gives the wrong notion of determinant (recall that the determinant of a matrix is defined as a sum of products of its entries, and in the case of a block matrix this is generally not the same as the corresponding sum of products of its blocks!). It is clearer to distinguish ''A'' from the endomorphism φ of an ''n''-dimensional vector space ''V'' (or free ''R''-module if ''R'' is not a field) defined by it in a basis ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and to take matrices over the ring End(''V'') of all such endomorphisms. Then φ ∈ End(''V'') is a possible matrix entry, while ''A'' designates the element of ''M''(''n'', End(''V'')) whose ''i'',''j'' entry is endomorphism of scalar multiplication by &lt;math&gt;A_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;; similarly ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; will be interpreted as element of ''M''(''n'', End(''V'')). However, since End(''V'') is not a commutative ring, no determinant is defined on ''M''(''n'', End(''V'')); this can only be done for matrices over a commutative subring of End(''V''). Now the entries of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\varphi I_n-A&lt;/math&gt; all lie in the subring ''R''[φ] generated by the identity and φ, which is commutative. Then a determinant map ''M''(''n'', ''R''[φ]) → ''R''[φ] is defined, and &lt;math&gt;\det(\varphi I_n-A)&lt;/math&gt; evaluates to the value ''p''(φ) of the characteristic polynomial of ''A'' at φ (this holds independently of the relation between ''A'' and φ); the Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that ''p''(φ) is the null endomorphism.

In this form, the following proof can be obtained from that of {{Harvard citations|last1 = Atiyah|last2 = MacDonald|year = 1969|loc = Prop. 2.4}} (which in fact is the more general statement related to the [[Nakayama lemma]]; one takes for the ideal in that proposition the whole ring ''R''). The fact that ''A'' is the matrix of φ in the basis ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; means that
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(e_i) = \sum_{j = 1}^n A_{j,i} e_j \quad\text{for }i=1,\ldots,n.&lt;/math&gt;
One can interpret these as ''n'' components of one equation in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, whose members can be written using the matrix-vector product ''M''(''n'', End(''V'')) × ''V&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' → ''V&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' that is defined as usual, but with individual entries ψ ∈ End(''V'') and ''v'' in ''V'' being "multiplied" by forming &lt;math&gt;\psi(v)&lt;/math&gt;; this gives:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi I_n \cdot E= A^\operatorname{tr}\cdot E,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E\in V^n&lt;/math&gt; is the element whose component ''i'' is ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; (in other words it is the basis ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''V'' written as a column of vectors). Writing this equation as
:&lt;math&gt;(\varphi I_n-A^\operatorname{tr})\cdot E=0\in V^n&lt;/math&gt;
one recognizes the [[transpose]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\varphi I_n-A&lt;/math&gt; considered above, and its determinant (as element of ''M''(''n'', ''R''[φ])) is also ''p''(φ). To derive from this equation that ''p''(φ) = 0 ∈ End(''V''), one left-multiplies by the [[adjugate matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;\varphi I_n-A^\operatorname{tr}&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined in the matrix ring ''M''(''n'', ''R''[φ]), giving
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 0&amp;=\operatorname{adj}(\varphi I_n-A^\operatorname{tr})\cdot((\varphi I_n-A^\operatorname{tr})\cdot E)\\
  &amp;= (\operatorname{adj}(\varphi I_n-A^\operatorname{tr})\cdot(\varphi I_n-A^\operatorname{tr}))\cdot E\\
  &amp;= (\det(\varphi I_n-A^\operatorname{tr})I_n)\cdot E\\
  &amp;= (p(\varphi)I_n)\cdot E;
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
the associativity of matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication used in the first step is a purely formal property of those operations, independent of the nature of the entries. Now component ''i'' of this equation says that ''p''(φ)(''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') = 0 ∈ ''V''; thus ''p''(φ) vanishes on all ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, and since these elements generate ''V'' it follows that ''p''(φ) = 0 ∈ End(''V''), completing the proof.

One additional fact that follows from this proof is that the matrix ''A'' whose characteristic polynomial is taken need not be identical to the value φ substituted into that polynomial; it suffices that φ be an endomorphism of ''V'' satisfying the initial equations

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(e_i) = \sum_j A_{j,i} e_j&lt;/math&gt;
for ''some'' sequence of elements ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; that generate ''V'' (which space might have smaller dimension than ''n'', or in case the ring ''R'' is not a field it might not be a [[free module]] at all).

=== A bogus "proof": ''p''(''A'') = det(''AI''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''A'') = det(''A''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''A'') = 0 ===
One persistent elementary but '''''incorrect''''' argument&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garrett|2007|p. 381}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for the theorem is to "simply" take the definition
:&lt;math&gt;p(\lambda) = \det(\lambda I_n - A)&lt;/math&gt;
and substitute {{mvar|A}} for {{mvar|λ}}, obtaining
:&lt;math&gt;p(A)=\det(A I_n - A) = \det(A - A) = 0~.&lt;/math&gt;

There are many ways to see why this argument is wrong. First, in Cayley–Hamilton theorem, ''p''(''A'') is an ''n×n matrix''.  However, the right hand side of the above equation is the value of a determinant, which is a ''scalar''. So they cannot be equated unless ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (i.e. ''A'' is just a scalar).  Second, in the expression &lt;math&gt;\det(\lambda I_n - A)&lt;/math&gt;, the variable λ actually occurs at the diagonal entries of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\lambda I_n - A&lt;/math&gt;.  To illustrate, consider the characteristic polynomial in the previous example again:

:&lt;math&gt;\det\begin{pmatrix}\lambda-1&amp;-2\\-3&amp;\lambda-4\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

If one substitutes the entire matrix ''A'' for λ in those positions, one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\det\begin{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\ 3 &amp; 4 \end{pmatrix} - 1 &amp; -2 \\ -3 &amp;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\ 3 &amp; 4 \end{pmatrix} - 4\end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

in which the "matrix" expression is simply not a valid one.  Note, however, that if scalar multiples of identity matrices
instead of scalars are subtracted in the above, i.e. if the substitution is performed as

:&lt;math&gt; \det \begin{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\ 3 &amp; 4 \end{pmatrix} - I_2 &amp; -2I_2 \\ -3I_2 &amp;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\ 3 &amp; 4 \end{pmatrix} - 4I_2 \end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

then the determinant is indeed zero, but the expanded matrix in question does not evaluate to &lt;math&gt;A I_n-A&lt;/math&gt;; nor can its determinant (a scalar) be compared to ''p''(''A'') (a matrix).  So the argument that &lt;math&gt;p(A)=\det(AI_n-A)=0&lt;/math&gt; still does not apply.

Actually, if such an argument holds, it should also hold when other [[multilinear form]]s instead of determinant is used. For instance, if we consider the [[Permanent (mathematics)|permanent]] function and define &lt;math&gt;q(\lambda) = \operatorname{perm}(\lambda I_n - A)&lt;/math&gt;, then by the same argument, we should be able to "prove" that ''q''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  But this statement is demonstrably wrong.  In the 2-dimensional case, for instance, the permanent of a matrix is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{perm} \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{pmatrix} = ad + bc. &lt;/math&gt;

So, for the matrix ''A'' in the previous example,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
q(\lambda) &amp; = \operatorname{perm} (\lambda I_2 - A) = \operatorname{perm} \begin{pmatrix} \lambda - 1 &amp; -2  \\ -3 &amp; \lambda-4 \end{pmatrix} \\[6pt]
&amp; = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 4) + (-2)(-3) = \lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 10.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Yet one can verify that

:&lt;math&gt;q(A)=A^2-5A+10I_2=12I_2\not=0.&lt;/math&gt;

One of the proofs for Cayley–Hamilton theorem above bears some similarity to the argument that &lt;math&gt;p(A)=\det(AI_n-A)=0&lt;/math&gt;. By introducing a matrix with non-numeric coefficients, one can actually let ''A'' live inside a matrix entry, but then &lt;math&gt;A I_n&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to ''A'', and the conclusion is reached differently.

==Abstraction and generalizations==
The above proofs show that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for matrices with entries in any commutative ring ''R'', and that ''p''(φ) = 0 will hold whenever φ is an endomorphism of an ''R'' module generated by elements ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; that satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(e_j)=\sum a_{ij}e_i, \qquad j =1, \ldots, n.&lt;/math&gt;

This more general version of the theorem is the source of the celebrated [[Nakayama lemma]] in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

'''Charlotte Froese Fischer''' (born 1929) is a [[Canadian-American]] [[applied mathematics|applied mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]] who gained world recognition for the development and implementation of the [[Multi-configurational self-consistent field|Multi-Configurational Hartree–Fock]] (MCHF) approach to atomic-structure calculations and for her theoretical prediction concerning the existence of the negative [[calcium]] [[ion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Early life==
Charlotte Froese was born on September 21, 1929, in the village of Pravdivka (formerly Nikolayevka&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Her parents immigrated to Germany in 1929 on the last train allowed to cross the border before its closure by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities. After a few months in a [[refugee camp]], her family was allowed to immigrate to Canada, where they eventually established themselves in [[Chilliwack, British Columbia]].

==Education and research==
She obtained both a B.A. degree, with honors, in Mathematics and Chemistry and an M.A. degree in Applied Mathematics from the [[University of British Columbia]] in 1952 and 1954, respectively. She then obtained her Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Computing at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1957, pursuing coursework in quantum theory with [[Paul Dirac]]. She worked under the supervision of [[Douglas Hartree]], whom she assisted in programming the [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator]] (EDSAC) for atomic-structure calculations.

She served on the mathematics faculty of the University of British Columbia from 1957 till 1968, where she introduced numerical analysis and computer courses into the curriculum and was instrumental in the formation of the Computer Science Department.

The years 1963-64 were spent by Froese Fischer at the [[Harvard College Observatory]], where she extended her research on atomic-structure calculations. While at [[Harvard]], she was the first woman-scientist to be awarded an [[Alfred P. Sloan]] Fellowship. In 1991 she became a Fellow of the American Physical Society, in part for her contribution to the discovery of negative calcium. In 1995 she was elected a member of the [[Royal Physiographic Society in Lund]], in 2004 a foreign member of the [[Lithuanian Academy of Sciences]], and in 2015 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Technology from [[Malmö University]], Sweden.

==Contributions==
She is the author of over 300 research articles on computational atomic theory, many of which have had far-reaching impact in the area of atomic-structure calculations. The early version of the MCHF program, published in the first volume of [[Computer Physics Communications]] received two [http://www.citationclassics.org/  Citation Classics Awards] in 1987. One of her largest efforts in the field is the recent calculation of the complete lower spectra of the [[beryllium]]-like to [[argon]]-like [[Isoelectronicity|isoelectronic]] sequences, amounting to the publication of data covering 400 journal pages and a total of over 150 ions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2052">In [[cryptography]], '''concrete security''' or '''exact security''' is a practice-oriented approach that aims to give more precise estimates of the computational complexities of [[Adversary (cryptography)|adversarial]] tasks than [[Polynomial-time reduction|polynomial equivalence]] would allow.

Traditionally, [[provable security]] is '''asymptotic''': it classifies the hardness of computational problems using polynomial-time reducibility. Secure schemes are defined to be those in which the advantage of any [[computationally bounded adversary]] is [[negligible function (cryptography)|negligible]]. While such a theoretical guarantee is important, in practice one needs to know exactly how efficient a reduction is because of the need to instantiate the [[security parameter]] - it is not enough to know that "sufficiently large" security parameters will do. An inefficient reduction results either in the success probability for the adversary or the  resource requirement of the scheme being greater than desired.

Concrete security parametrizes all the resources available to the adversary, such as running time and memory, and other resources specific to the system in question, such as the number of plaintexts it can obtain or the number of queries it can make to any [[Oracle_attack|oracles]] available. Then the advantage of the adversary is upper bounded as a function of these resources and of the problem size. It is often possible to give a lower bound (i.e. an adversarial strategy) matching the upper bound, hence the name exact security.

[[File:Covering space diagram.svg|thumb|250px|right|A covering map satisfies the local triviality condition. Intuitively, such maps locally project a "stack of pancakes" above an [[open set|open region]], ''U'', onto ''U''.]]

In [[mathematics]], more specifically [[algebraic topology]], a '''covering map''' (also '''covering projection''') is a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] ''p''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spanier |first=Edwin |title=Algebraic Topology |year=1966 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=62|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a [[topological space]] ''C'' to a topological space ''X'' such that each point in ''X'' has an [[open set|open]] neighbourhood '''evenly covered''' by ''p'' (as shown in the image); the precise definition is given below. In this case, ''C'' is called a '''covering space''' and ''X'' the '''base space''' of the covering projection. The definition implies that every covering map is a [[local homeomorphism]].

Covering spaces play an important role in [[homotopy theory]], [[harmonic analysis]], [[Riemannian geometry]] and [[differential topology]]. In Riemannian geometry for example, [[Ramification (mathematics)#In algebraic topology|ramification]] is a generalization of the notion of covering maps. Covering spaces are also deeply intertwined with the study of homotopy groups and, in particular, the [[fundamental group]]. An important application comes from the result that, if ''X'' is a "sufficiently good" [[topological space]], there is a [[bijection]] between the collection of all isomorphism classes of [[connected space|connected coverings]] of ''X'' and the conjugacy classes of subgroups of the [[fundamental group]] of ''X''.

== Formal definition ==
Let ''X'' be a [[topological space]].  A '''covering space''' of ''X'' is a topological space ''C'' together with a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] [[surjective]] map

:&lt;math&gt;p \colon C \to X\,&lt;/math&gt;

such that for every &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an [[open set|open]] [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;p^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; (the [[inverse image]] of ''U'' under ''p'') is a union of disjoint open sets in ''C'', each of which is mapped [[homeomorphism|homeomorphically]] onto ''U'' by ''p''.&lt;ref name="Chernavskii"&gt;{{harvnb|Chernavskii|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Munkres p336"&gt;{{harvnb|Munkres|2000|p=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The map ''p'' is called the '''covering map''',&lt;ref name="Munkres p336"/&gt; the space ''X'' is often called the '''base space''' of the covering, and the space ''C'' is called the '''total space''' of the covering.  For any point ''x'' in the base the inverse image of ''x'' in ''C'' is necessarily a [[discrete space]]&lt;ref name="Munkres p336"/&gt; called the [[Fiber (mathematics)|fiber]] over ''x''.

The special open neighborhoods ''U'' of ''x'' given in the definition are called '''evenly covered neighborhoods'''.  The evenly covered neighborhoods form an [[open cover]] of the space ''X''.  The homeomorphic copies in ''C'' of an evenly covered neighborhood ''U'' are called the '''sheets''' over ''U''.  One generally pictures ''C'' as "hovering above" ''X'', with ''p'' mapping "downwards", the sheets over ''U'' being horizontally stacked above each other and above ''U'', and the fiber over ''x'' consisting of those points of ''C'' that lie "vertically above" ''x''.  In particular, covering maps are locally trivial.  This means that locally, each covering map is 'isomorphic' to a projection in the sense that there is a homeomorphism, ''h'', from the pre-image &lt;math&gt;p^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt;, of an evenly covered neighbourhood ''U'', onto &lt;math&gt;U \times F&lt;/math&gt;, where ''F'' is the fiber, satisfying the '''local trivialization condition''', which is that, if we project &lt;math&gt;U \times F&lt;/math&gt; onto ''U'', &lt;math&gt;\pi\colon U \times F \to U&lt;/math&gt;, so the composition of the projection {{pi}} with the homeomorphism ''h'' will be a map &lt;math&gt;\pi\circ h&lt;/math&gt; from the pre-image &lt;math&gt;p^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; onto ''U'', then the derived composition &lt;math&gt;\pi\circ h&lt;/math&gt; will equal ''p'' locally (within &lt;math&gt;p^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt;).

===Alternative definitions===
Many authors impose some [[connectedness|connectivity]] conditions on the spaces ''X'' and ''C'' in the definition of a covering map.  In particular, many authors require both spaces to be [[path-connected]] and [[locally path-connected]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Knot Theory|date = 1997|last = Lickorish|pages = 66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Topology and Geometry|last = Bredon|year = 1997|isbn = 978-0387979267}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can prove helpful because many theorems hold only if the spaces in question have these properties.  Some authors omit the assumption of surjectivity, for if ''X'' is connected and ''C'' is nonempty then surjectivity of the covering map actually follows from the other axioms.

== Examples ==
* Every space trivially covers itself.
* A connected and locally path-connected topological space ''X'' has a [[universal cover]] if and only if it is [[semi-locally simply connected]].
* ℝ is the universal cover of the unit circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The [[spin group]] Spin(''n'') is a double cover of the [[special orthogonal group]] and a universal cover when ''n'' &gt; 2. The accidental, or [[exceptional isomorphism]]s for Lie groups then give isomorphisms between spin groups in low dimension and classical Lie groups.
* The [[unitary group]] U(''n'') has universal cover SU(''n'') × ℝ.
*  The [[n-sphere]] ''S&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a double cover of real projective space '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and is a universal cover for ''n'' &gt; 1.
* Every manifold has an [[orientable double cover]] that is connected if and only if the manifold is non-orientable.
* The [[uniformization theorem]] asserts that every Riemann surface has a universal cover conformally equivalent to the [[Riemann sphere]], the complex plane, or the unit disc.
* The universal cover of a wedge of ''n'' circles is the [[Cayley graph]] of the free group on ''n'' generators, i.e.  a [[Bethe lattice]].
* The [[torus]] is a double cover of the [[Klein bottle]]. This can be seen using the polygon's for the torus and the Klein bottle, and observing that the double cover of the circle &lt;math&gt;S^1 \to S^1&lt;/math&gt; (embedding into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto z^2&lt;/math&gt;). 
* Every graph has a [[bipartite double cover]]. Since every graph is homotopic to a wedge of circles, its universal cover is a Cayley graph.
* Every immersion from a compact manifold to a manifold of the same dimension is a covering of its image.
* Infinite-fold abelian covering graphs of finite graphs are regarded as abstractions of crystal structures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toshikazu Sunada|Sunada T.]] (2012), ''Topological Crystallography ---With a View Towards Discrete Geometric Analysis---", Surveys and Tutorials in the Applied Mathematical Sciences, Vol. 6, Springer&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another effective tool for constructing covering spaces is using quotients by free finite group actions.
* For example, the space &lt;math&gt;L_{p/q}&lt;/math&gt; defined by the quotient of &lt;math&gt;S^3&lt;/math&gt; (embedded into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt;) is defined by the quotient space via the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/q&lt;/math&gt;-action &lt;math&gt;(z_1,z_2) \mapsto (e^{2\pi i/q}z_1,e^{2\pi i p/q}z_2)&lt;/math&gt;. This space, called a [[lens space]], has fundamental group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/q&lt;/math&gt; and has universal cover &lt;math&gt;S^3&lt;/math&gt;.
For instance the [[diamond cubic|diamond crystal]] as an abstract graph is the maximal abelian covering graph of the [[dipole graph]] D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
* The map of [[Spectrum of a ring|affine schemes]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}( \mathbb{C}[x,t,t^{-1}]/(x^n - t)) \to \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}])&lt;/math&gt; forms a covering space with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n&lt;/math&gt; as its group of deck transformations. This is an example of a cyclic [[Étale fundamental group|Galois cover]].

== Properties ==

===Common local properties===
* Every cover &lt;math&gt; p \colon C \to X &lt;/math&gt; is a [[local homeomorphism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Munkres|2000|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;—that is, for every {{nowrap|''c'' ∈ ''C''}}, there exists a neighborhood {{nowrap|''U'' ⊆ ''C''}} of ''c'' and a neighborhood {{nowrap|''V'' ⊆ ''X''}} of ''p''(''c'') such that the restriction of ''p'' to ''U'' yields a [[homeomorphism]] from ''U'' to ''V''. This implies that ''C'' and ''X'' share all local properties. If ''X'' is [[simply connected]] and ''C'' is connected, then this holds globally as well, and the covering ''p'' is a homeomorphism.
* If {{nowrap|''p'' : ''E'' → ''B''}} and {{nowrap|''p''′ : ''E''′ → ''B''′}} are covering maps, then so is the map {{nowrap|''p'' × ''p''′ : ''E'' × ''E''′ → ''B'' × ''B′''}} given by {{nowrap|1=(''p'' × ''p''′)(''e'', ''e''′) = (''p''(''e''), ''p''′(''e''′))}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Munkres|2000|p=339|loc=Theorem 53.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homeomorphism of the fibers===
For every ''x'' in ''X'', the fiber over ''x'' is a [[discrete space|discrete]] subset of ''C''.&lt;ref name="Munkres p336"/&gt; On every [[connected space|connected component]] of ''X'', the fibers are homeomorphic.

If ''X'' is connected, there is a discrete space ''F'' such that for every ''x'' in ''X'' the fiber over ''x'' is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to ''F'' and, moreover, for every ''x'' in ''X'' there is a neighborhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that its full pre-image ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') is homeomorphic to {{nowrap|''U'' × ''F''}}. In particular, the [[cardinality]] of the fiber over ''x'' is equal to the cardinality of ''F'' and it is called the '''degree of the cover''' {{nowrap|''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}}.  Thus, if every fiber has ''n'' elements, we speak of an '''''n''-fold covering''' (for the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}}, the covering is trivial; when {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, the covering is a '''double cover'''; when {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}, the covering is a '''triple cover''' and so on).

===Lifting properties===
{{see also|Homotopy lifting property}}
If {{nowrap|1=''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}} is a cover and γ is a path in ''X'' (i.e. a continuous map from the [[unit interval]] {{nowrap|[0, 1]}} into ''X'') and {{nowrap|''c'' ∈ ''C''}} is a point "lying over" γ(0) (i.e. {{nowrap|1=''p''(''c'') = γ(0))}}, then there exists a unique path Γ in ''C'' lying over γ (i.e. {{nowrap|1=''p'' ∘ Γ = γ}}) such that {{nowrap|1=Γ(0) = ''c''}}.  The curve Γ is called the '''lift''' of γ. If ''x'' and ''y'' are two points in ''X'' connected by a path, then that path furnishes a [[bijection]] between the fiber over ''x'' and the fiber over ''y'' via the lifting property.

More generally, let {{nowrap|''f'' : ''Z'' → ''X''}} be a continuous map to ''X'' from a [[path connected]] and [[locally path connected]] space ''Z''. Fix a base-point {{nowrap|''z'' ∈ ''Z''}}, and choose a point {{nowrap|''c'' ∈ ''C''}} "lying over" ''f''(''z'') (i.e. {{nowrap|1=''p''(''c'') = ''f''(''z'')}}). Then there exists a '''lift''' of ''f'' (that is, a continuous map {{nowrap|''g'' : ''Z'' → ''C''}} for which {{nowrap|1=''p'' ∘ ''g'' = ''f''}} and {{nowrap|1=''g''(''z'') = ''c''}}) [[if and only if]] the [[induced homomorphism]]s {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt; : {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Z'', ''z'') → {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''f''(''z''))}} and {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt; : {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c'') → {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''f''(''z''))}} at the level of [[fundamental groups]] satisfy

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;f_\#(\pi_1(Z,z))\subset p_\#(\pi_1(C,c)). &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|♠}}}}

Moreover, if such a lift ''g'' of ''f'' exists, it is unique.

In particular, if the space ''Z'' is assumed to be [[simply connected]] (so that {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Z'', ''z'')}} is trivial), condition {{EquationNote|♠|(♠)}} is automatically satisfied, and every continuous map from ''Z'' to ''X'' can be lifted. Since the unit interval {{nowrap|[0, 1]}} is simply connected, the lifting property for paths is a special case of the lifting property for maps stated above.

If {{nowrap|''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}} is a covering and {{nowrap|''c'' ∈ ''C''}} and {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} are such that {{nowrap|1=''p''(''c'') = ''x''}}, then ''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt; is injective at the level of [[fundamental groups]], and the induced homomorphisms {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt; : {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c'') → {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} are [[group isomorphism|isomorphisms]] for all {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}}. Both of these statements can be deduced from the lifting property for continuous maps. Surjectivity of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt; for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}} follows from the fact that for all such ''n'', the ''n''-sphere '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is simply connected and hence every continuous map from '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X'' can be lifted to ''C''.

===Equivalence===
Let {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''}} and {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''}} be two coverings. One says that the two coverings ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are '''equivalent''' if there exists a homeomorphism {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; : ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and  such that {{nowrap|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Equivalence classes of coverings correspond to conjugacy classes of subgroups of the [[fundamental group]] of ''X'', as discussed below. If {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; : ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a covering (rather than a homeomorphism) and {{nowrap|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then one says that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; '''dominates''' ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Covering of a manifold===
Since coverings are local [[homeomorphism]]s, a covering of a topological ''n''-[[manifold]] is an ''n''-manifold. (One can prove that the covering space is [[second-countable]] from the fact that the [[fundamental group]] of a manifold is always [[countable]].) However a space covered by an ''n''-manifold may be a [[non-Hausdorff manifold]].  An example is given by letting ''C'' be the plane with the origin deleted and ''X'' the quotient space obtained by identifying every point {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} with {{nowrap|(2''x'', ''y''/2)}}.  If {{nowrap|''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}} is the quotient map then it is a covering since the action of ''Z'' on ''C'' generated by {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'', ''y'') = (2''x'', ''y''/2)}} is [[properly discontinuous]].  The points {{nowrap|''p''(1, 0)}} and {{nowrap|''p''(0, 1)}} do not have disjoint neighborhoods in ''X''.

Any covering space of a differentiable manifold may be equipped with a (natural) differentiable structure that turns ''p'' (the covering map in question) into a [[local diffeomorphism]] – a map with constant [[Rank (differential topology)|rank]] ''n''.

== Universal covers ==
:: ''N.B. The terms "[[Universal cover]]" and "[[Universal covering]]" link to this section, but are also used in the context of [[Lebesgue's universal covering problem]].''
A covering space is a '''universal covering space''' if it is [[simply connected]]. The name ''[[universal property|universal]] cover'' comes from the following important property: if the mapping {{nowrap|''q'': ''D'' → ''X''}} is a universal cover of the space ''X'' and the mapping {{nowrap|''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}} is any cover of the space ''X'' where the covering space ''C'' is connected, then there exists a covering map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''D'' → ''C''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''p'' ∘ ''f'' = ''q''}}.  This can be phrased as

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE &gt;The universal cover (of the space ''X'') covers any connected cover (of the space ''X'').&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE &gt;

The map ''f'' is unique in the following sense: if we fix a point ''x'' in the space ''X'' and a point ''d'' in the space ''D'' with {{nowrap|1=''q''(''d'') = ''x''}} and a point ''c'' in the space ''C'' with {{nowrap|1=''p''(''c'') = ''x''}}, then there exists a unique covering map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''D'' → ''C''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''p'' ∘ ''f''= ''q''}} and {{nowrap|1=''f''(''d'') = ''c''}}.

If the space ''X'' has a universal cover then that universal cover is essentially unique: if the mappings {{nowrap|''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''}} and {{nowrap|''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''}} are two universal covers of the space ''X'' then there exists a homeomorphism {{nowrap|''f'' : ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that {{nowrap|1=''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f'' = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The space ''X'' has a universal cover if it is [[Connected space|connected]], [[Connected space#Local connectedness|locally path-connected]] and [[semi-locally simply connected]]. The universal cover of the space ''X'' can be constructed as a certain space of paths in the space ''X''. More explicitly, it forms a [[principal bundle]] with the [[fundamental group]] {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')}} as structure group.

The example {{nowrap|'''R''' → '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} given above is a universal cover. The map {{nowrap|'''S'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → SO(3)}} from [[quaternion|unit quaternions]] to [[rotation]]s of 3D space described in [[quaternions and spatial rotation]] is also a universal cover.

If the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; carries some additional structure, then its universal cover usually inherits that structure:
* If the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[manifold]], then so is its universal cover ''D''.
* If the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Riemann surface]], then so is its universal cover ''D'', and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] map.
* If the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Riemannian manifold]], then so is its universal cover, and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a  [[Isometry (Riemannian geometry)|local isometry]].
* If the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lorentzian manifold]], then so is its universal cover.  Furthermore, suppose the subset ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') is a [[disjoint union]] of open sets each of which is diffeomorphic with ''U'' by the mapping &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.  If the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; contains a [[closed timelike curve]] (CTC), then the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[timelike multiply connected]] (no CTC can be [[timelike homotopic]] to a point, as that point would not be causally well behaved), its universal (diffeomorphic) cover is [[timelike simply connected]] (it does not contain a CTC).
* If ''X'' is a [[Lie group]] (as in the two examples above), then so is its universal cover ''D'', and the mapping ''p'' is a homomorphism of Lie groups.   In this case the universal cover is also called the ''[[universal covering group]]''.  This has particular application to [[representation theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]], since ordinary [[Group representation|representations]] of the universal covering group (''D'') are [[projective representation]]s of the original (classical) group (''X'').

The universal cover first arose in the theory of [[analytic functions]] as the natural domain of an [[analytic continuation]].

== G-coverings ==
Let ''G'' be a [[discrete group]] [[group action|acting]] on the [[topological space]] ''X''. It is natural to ask under what conditions the projection from ''X'' to the [[orbit space]] ''X''/''G'' is a covering map. This is not always true since the action may have fixed points. An example for this is the cyclic group of order 2 acting on a product {{nowrap|''X'' × ''X''}} by the twist action where the non-identity element acts by {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'') ↦ (''y'', ''x'')}}. Thus the study of the relation between the fundamental groups of ''X'' and ''X''/''G'' is not so straightforward.

However the group ''G'' does act on the fundamental groupoid of ''X'', and so the study is best handled by considering groups  acting on groupoids, and the corresponding ''orbit groupoids''. The theory for this  is set down in Chapter 11 of the book ''Topology and groupoids'' referred to below. The main result is that for discontinuous actions of a group ''G'' on a Hausdorff space ''X'' which admits a universal cover, then the fundamental groupoid of the orbit space ''X''/''G'' is isomorphic to the orbit groupoid of the fundamental groupoid of ''X'', i.e. the quotient of that groupoid by the action of the group ''G''. This leads to explicit computations, for example of the fundamental group of the symmetric square of a space.

== {{anchor|Deck transformation}} Deck transformation group, regular covers ==
A '''deck transformation''' or '''automorphism''' of a cover {{nowrap|''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}} is a [[homeomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'' : ''C'' → ''C''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''p'' ∘ ''f'' = ''p''}}. The set of all deck transformations of ''p'' forms a group under [[function composition|composition]], the '''deck transformation group''' Aut(''p''). Deck transformations are also called '''covering transformations'''. Every deck transformation [[permutation|permutes]] the elements of each fiber. This defines a [[group action]] of the deck transformation group on each fiber. Note that by the unique lifting property, if ''f'' is not the identity and ''C'' is path connected, then ''f'' has no [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]].

Now suppose {{nowrap|''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}} is a covering map and ''C'' (and therefore also ''X'') is connected and locally path connected. The action of Aut(''p'') on each fiber is [[group action#Types of actions|free]]. If this action is [[group action#Types of actions|transitive]] on some fiber, then it is transitive on all fibers, and we call the cover '''regular''' (or '''normal''' or '''Galois'''). Every such regular cover is a [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundle]], where {{nowrap|1=''G'' = Aut(''p'')}} is considered as a discrete topological group.

Every universal cover {{nowrap|''p'' : ''D'' → ''X''}} is regular, with deck transformation group being isomorphic to the [[fundamental group]] {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

As another important example, consider '''C''' the complex plane and '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; the complex plane minus the origin.  Then the map {{nowrap|''p'' : '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; → '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{nowrap|1=''p''(''z'') = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a regular cover. The deck transformations are multiplications with ''n''-th [[root of unity|roots of unity]] and the deck transformation group is therefore isomorphic to the [[cyclic group]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Likewise, the map {{nowrap|''exp'' : '''C''' → '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{nowrap|1=exp(''z'') = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the universal cover.

== Monodromy action ==
{{main|Monodromy}}
Again suppose {{nowrap|''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}} is a covering map and ''C'' (and therefore also ''X'') is connected and locally path connected. If ''x'' is in ''X'' and ''c'' belongs to the fiber over ''x'' (i.e. {{nowrap|1=''p''(''c'') = ''x''}}), and {{nowrap|γ : [0, 1] → ''X''}} is a path with {{nowrap|1=γ(0) = γ(1) = ''x''}}, then this path lifts to a unique path in ''C'' with starting point ''c''. The end point of this lifted path need not be ''c'', but it must lie in the fiber over ''x''. It turns out that this end point only depends on the class of γ in the fundamental group {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}}. In this fashion we obtain a right [[group action]] of {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} on the fiber over ''x''. This is known as the '''monodromy action'''.

There are two actions on the fiber over {{nowrap|''x'' : Aut(''p'')}} acts on the left and {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} acts on the right. These two actions are compatible in the following sense:
&lt;math&gt;f\cdot(c\cdot\gamma) = (f\cdot c)\cdot\gamma&lt;/math&gt; for all ''f'' in Aut(''p''), ''c'' in ''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') and γ in {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}}.

If ''p'' is a universal cover, then Aut(''p'') can be naturally identified with the [[opposite group]] of {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} so that the left action of the opposite group of {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} coincides with the action of Aut(''p'') on the fiber over ''x''. Note that  Aut(''p'') and {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} are naturally isomorphic in this case (as a group is always naturally isomorphic to its opposite through {{nowrap|''g'' ↦ ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

If ''p'' is a [[Covering space#Deck transformation group.2C regular covers|regular]] cover, then Aut(''p'') is naturally isomorphic to a quotient of {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}}.

In general (for good spaces), Aut(''p'') is naturally isomorphic to the quotient of the [[Centralizer and normalizer|normalizer]] of {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;({{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c''))}} in {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} over {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;({{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c''))}}, where {{nowrap|1=''p''(''c'') = ''x''}}.

==More on the group structure==
Let {{nowrap|''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}} be a covering map where both ''X'' and ''C'' are path-connected. Let {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} be a basepoint of ''X'' and let {{nowrap|''c'' ∈ ''C''}} be one of its pre-images in ''C'', that is {{nowrap|1=''p''(''c'') = ''x''}}. There is an [[induced homomorphism]] of [[fundamental group]]s {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt; : {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c'') → {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'',''x'')}} which is injective by the lifting property of coverings. Specifically if ''γ'' is a closed loop at ''c'' such that {{nowrap|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt;([''γ'']) = 1}}, that is {{nowrap|''p'' ∘ ''γ''}} is [[null-homotopic]] in ''X'', then consider a null-homotopy of {{nowrap|''p'' ∘ ''γ''}} as a map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → ''X''}} from the 2-disc ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X'' such that the restriction of ''f'' to the boundary '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to {{nowrap|''p'' ∘ ''γ''}}. By the lifting property the map ''f'' lifts to a continuous map {{nowrap|''g'' : ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → ''C''}} such that the restriction of ''g'' to the boundary '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; of ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to ''γ''. Therefore, ''γ'' is [[null-homotopic]] in ''C'', so that the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt; : {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c'') → {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} is trivial and thus {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt; : {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c'') → {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} is an injective homomorphism.

Therefore, {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c'')}} is isomorphic to the subgroup {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt;({{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c''))}} of {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}}. If {{nowrap|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''C''}} is another pre-image of ''x'' in ''C'' then the [[subgroup]]s {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt;({{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c''))}} and {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt;({{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;))}} are [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] in {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} by ''p''-image of a curve in ''C'' connecting ''c'' to ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus a covering map {{nowrap|''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}} defines a conjugacy class of subgroups of {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} and one can show that equivalent covers of ''X'' define the same conjugacy class of subgroups of {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}}.

For a covering {{nowrap|''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}} the group {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt;({{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c''))}} can also be seen to be equal to

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_p(c) = \{ [\gamma] : \gamma_C \text{ is a closed curve in } C \text { passing through } c\in C \},&lt;/math&gt;

the set of [[homotopy class]]es of those closed curves γ based at ''x'' whose lifts ''γ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''C'', starting at ''c'', are closed curves at ''c''. If ''X'' and ''C'' are path-connected, the degree of the cover ''p'' (that is, the cardinality of any fiber of ''p'') is equal to the [[Index of a subgroup|index]] [{{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'') : ''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt;({{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c''))}}] of the [[subgroup]] {{nowrap|''p''&lt;sub&gt;#&lt;/sub&gt;({{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'', ''c''))}} in {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}}.

A key result of the covering space theory says that for a "sufficiently good" space ''X'' (namely, if ''X'' is path-connected, locally path-connected and [[semi-locally simply connected]]) there is in fact a bijection between equivalence classes of path-connected covers of ''X'' and the conjugacy classes of subgroups of the fundamental group {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}}. The main step in proving this result is establishing the existence of a universal cover, that is a cover corresponding to the trivial subgroup of {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}}. Once the existence of a universal cover ''C'' of ''X'' is established, if ''H'' ≤ {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'') is an arbitrary subgroup, the space ''C''/''H'' is the covering of ''X'' corresponding to ''H''. One also needs to check that two covers of ''X'' corresponding to the same (conjugacy class of) subgroup of {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}} are equivalent. Connected [[cell complex]]es and connected [[manifold]]s are examples of "sufficiently good" spaces.

Let ''N''(''Γ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'') be the [[normalizer]] of Γ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; in {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}}.  The deck transformation group Aut(''p'') is isomorphic to the [[quotient group]] ''N''(Γ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;)/Γ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. If ''p'' is a universal covering, then ''Γ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[trivial group]], and Aut(''p'') is isomorphic to {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

Let us reverse this argument. Let ''N'' be a [[normal subgroup]] of {{nowrap|{{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''x'')}}.  By the above arguments, this defines a (regular) covering {{nowrap|''p'' : ''C'' → ''X''}}.  Let ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in ''C'' be in the fiber of ''x''.  Then for every other ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the fiber of ''x'', there is precisely one deck transformation that takes ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This deck transformation corresponds to a curve ''g'' in ''C'' connecting ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Relations with groupoids==
One of the ways of expressing the algebraic content of the theory of covering spaces is using [[groupoids]] and the [[fundamental groupoid]]. The latter functor gives an equivalence of categories

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_1: \operatorname{TopCov}(X) \to \operatorname{GpdCov}(\pi_1 X)&lt;/math&gt;

between the category of covering spaces of a reasonably nice space ''X'' and the category of groupoid covering morphisms of {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). Thus a particular kind of ''map'' of spaces is well modelled by a particular kind of ''morphism'' of groupoids.  The category of covering morphisms of a groupoid ''G'' is also equivalent to the category of actions of ''G'' on sets, and this allows the recovery of more traditional classifications of coverings.  Proofs of these facts are given in the book 'Topology and Groupoids' referenced below.

==Relations with classifying spaces and group cohomology==
If ''X'' is a connected [[cell complex]] with [[homotopy group]]s {{nowrap|1={{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') = 0}} for all {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}}, then the universal covering space ''T'' of ''X'' is contractible, as follows from applying the [[Whitehead theorem]] to ''T''. In this case ''X'' is a [[classifying space]] or {{nowrap|''K''(''G'', 1)}} for {{nowrap|1=''G'' = {{pi}}&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')}}.

Moreover, for every {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 0}} the group of cellular ''n''-chains ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') (that is, a [[free abelian group]] with basis given by ''n''-cells in ''T'') also has a natural '''Z'''''G''-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] structure. Here for an ''n''-cell ''σ'' in ''T'' and for ''g'' in ''G'' the cell ''g'' σ is exactly the translate of σ by a covering transformation of ''T'' corresponding to ''g''. Moreover, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') is a [[Free module|free]] '''Z'''''G''-module with free '''Z'''''G''-basis given by representatives of ''G''-orbits of ''n''-cells in ''T''. In this case the standard topological chain complex

:&lt;math&gt; \cdots \overset{\partial}{\to} C_n(T)\overset{\partial}{\to} C_{n-1}(T)\overset{\partial}{\to} \cdots \overset{\partial}{\to} C_0(T)\overset{\varepsilon}{\to} \mathbf Z, &lt;/math&gt;

where ε is the [[augmentation map]], is a [[free resolution|free '''Z'''''G''-resolution]] of '''Z''' (where '''Z''' is equipped with the trivial '''Z'''''G''-module structure, {{nowrap|1=''gm'' = ''m''}} for every {{nowrap|''g'' ∈ ''G''}} and every {{nowrap|''m'' ∈ '''Z'''}}). This resolution can be used to compute [[group cohomology]] of ''G'' with arbitrary coefficients.

The method of Graham Ellis for computing group resolutions and other aspects of homological algebra, as shown in his paper in J. Symbolic Comp. and his web page listed below, is to build a universal cover of a prospective {{nowrap|''K''(''G'', 1)}} inductively  at the same time as  a contracting homotopy of this universal cover. It is the latter which gives the computational method.

==Generalizations==
As a homotopy theory, the notion of covering spaces works well when the deck transformation group is discrete, or, equivalently, when the space is [[locally path-connected]]. However, when the deck transformation group is a [[topological group]] whose topology is not [[discrete topology|discrete]], difficulties arise. Some progress has been made for more complex spaces, such as the [[Hawaiian earring]]; see the references there for further information.

A number of these difficulties are resolved with the notion of ''semicovering'' due to Jeremy Brazas, see the paper cited below. Every covering map is a semicovering, but semicoverings satisfy the "2 out of 3" rule: given a composition {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''fg''}} of maps of spaces, if two of the maps are semicoverings, then so also is the third.  This rule does not hold for coverings, since the composition of covering maps need not be a covering map.

Another generalisation is to actions of a group which are not free.  Ross Geoghegan in his 1986 review ({{MR|0760769}}) of two papers by M.A. Armstrong on the fundamental groups of [[orbit space]]s wrote: "These two papers show which parts of elementary covering space theory carry over from the free to the nonfree case. This is the kind of basic material that ought to have been in standard textbooks on fundamental groups for the last fifty years." At present, "Topology and Groupoids" listed below seems to be the only basic topology text to cover such results.

==Applications==
[[Image:Rotating gimbal-xyz.gif|thumb|300px|[[Gimbal lock]] occurs because any map {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is not a covering map. In particular, the relevant map carries any element of ''T''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, an ordered triple (a,b,c) of angles (real numbers mod&amp;nbsp;2{{pi}}), to the composition of the three coordinate axis rotations R&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(a)∘R&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;(b)∘R&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;(c) by those angles, respectively. Each of these rotations, and their composition, is an element of the rotation group '''SO'''(3), which is topologically '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

This animation shows a set of three gimbals mounted together to allow ''three'' degrees of freedom. When all three gimbals are lined up (in the same plane), the system can only move in two dimensions from this configuration, not three, and is in ''gimbal lock''. In this case it can pitch or yaw, but not roll (rotate in the plane that the axes all lie in).]]

An important practical application of covering spaces occurs in [[charts on SO(3)]], the [[rotation group SO(3)|rotation group]]. This group occurs widely in engineering, due to 3-dimensional rotations being heavily used in [[navigation]], [[nautical engineering]], and [[aerospace engineering]], among many other uses. Topologically, SO(3) is the [[real projective space]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, with fundamental group '''Z'''/2, and only (non-trivial) covering space the hypersphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the group [[spin group|Spin(3)]], and represented by the unit [[quaternions]]. Thus quaternions are a preferred method for representing spatial rotations – see [[quaternions and spatial rotation]].

However, it is often desirable to represent rotations by a set of three numbers, known as [[Euler angles]] (in numerous variants), both because this is conceptually simpler for someone familiar with planar rotation, and because one can build a combination of three [[gimbal]]s to produce rotations in three dimensions. Topologically this corresponds to a map from the 3-torus ''T''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of three angles to the real projective space '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of rotations, and the resulting map has imperfections due to this map being unable to be a covering map. Specifically, the failure of the map to be a local homeomorphism at certain points is referred to as [[gimbal lock]], and is demonstrated in the animation at the right – at some points (when the axes are coplanar) the [[Rank (differential topology)|rank]] of the map is 2, rather than 3, meaning that only 2 dimensions of rotations can be realized from that point by changing the angles. This causes problems in applications, and is formalized by the notion of a covering space.

The '''Crystal Ball function''', named after the [[Crystal Ball (detector)|Crystal Ball]] Collaboration (hence the capitalized initial letters), is a [[probability density function]] commonly used to model various [[lossy process]]es in [[high-energy physics]]. It consists of a [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] core portion and a [[power-law]] low-end tail, below a certain threshold. The function itself and its first [[derivative]] are both [[Continuous function|continuous]].

The Crystal Ball function is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x;\alpha,n,\bar x,\sigma) = N \cdot \begin{cases} \exp(- \frac{(x - \bar x)^2}{2 \sigma^2}), &amp; \mbox{for }\frac{x - \bar x}{\sigma} &gt; -\alpha \\
 A \cdot (B - \frac{x - \bar x}{\sigma})^{-n}, &amp; \mbox{for }\frac{x - \bar x}{\sigma} \leqslant -\alpha \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;A = \left(\frac{n}{\left| \alpha \right|}\right)^n \cdot \exp\left(- \frac {\left| \alpha \right|^2}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{n}{\left| \alpha \right|}  - \left| \alpha \right|&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{1}{\sigma (C + D)}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{n}{\left| \alpha \right|} \cdot \frac{1}{n-1} \cdot \exp\left(- \frac {\left| \alpha \right|^2}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;D = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} \left(1 + \operatorname{erf}\left(\frac{\left| \alpha \right|}{\sqrt 2}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; (Skwarnicki 1986) is a normalization factor and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are parameters which are fitted with the data. erf is the [[error function]].

{{Calculus}}

In [[mathematics]], '''differential calculus''' is a subfield of [[calculus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/differential%20calculus|title=Definition of DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; concerned with the study of the rates at which quantities change. It is one of the two traditional divisions of calculus, the other being [[integral calculus]], the study of the area beneath a curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integral%20calculus|title="Integral Calculus - Definition of Integral calculus by Merriam-Webster"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objects of study in differential calculus are the [[derivative]] of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], related notions such as the [[Differential of a function|differential]], and their applications. The derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the rate of change of the function near that input value.  The process of finding a derivative is called '''differentiation'''. Geometrically, the derivative at a point is the [[slope]] of the [[tangent#Geometry|tangent line]] to the [[graph of a function|graph of the function]] at that point, provided that the derivative exists and is defined at that point. For a [[real-valued function]] of a single real variable, the derivative of a function at a point generally determines the best [[linear approximation]] to the function at that point.

Differential calculus and integral calculus are connected by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], which states that differentiation is the reverse process to [[integration (mathematics)|integration]].

Differentiation has applications to nearly all quantitative disciplines. For example, in [[physics]], the derivative of the [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] of a moving body with respect to [[time]] is the [[velocity]] of the body, and the derivative of velocity with respect to [[time]] is acceleration. The derivative of the [[momentum]] of a body equals the force applied to the body; rearranging this derivative statement leads to the famous {{math|'''F''' {{=}} ''m'''''a'''}} equation associated with [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law of motion]]. The [[reaction rate]] of a [[chemical reaction]] is a derivative. In [[operations research]], derivatives determine the most efficient ways to transport materials and design factories.

Derivatives are frequently used to find the [[maxima and minima]] of a function.  Equations involving derivatives are called [[differential equations]] and are fundamental in describing [[Natural phenomenon|natural phenomena]]. Derivatives and their generalizations appear in many fields of mathematics, such as [[complex analysis]], [[functional analysis]], [[differential geometry]], [[measure theory]], and [[abstract algebra]].

== Derivative ==
[[Image:Tangent-calculus.svg|thumb|300px|The [[tangent line]] at {{math|(''x'',''f''(''x''))}}]]
[[File:Tangent function animation.gif|thumb|300px|The derivative at different points of a differentiable function]]
{{Main|Derivative}}

Suppose that {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are [[real number]]s and that {{math|''y''}} is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of {{math|''x''}}, that is, for every value of {{math|''x''}}, there is a corresponding value of {{math|''y''}}. This relationship can be written as {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}}. If {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is the equation for a straight line (called a [[linear equation]]), then there are two real numbers {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''b''}} such that {{math|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''b''}}. In this "slope-intercept form", the term {{math|''m''}} is called the [[slope]] and can be determined from the formula:

:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x},&lt;/math&gt;
where the symbol {{math|Δ}} (the uppercase form of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[Delta (letter)|Delta]]) is an abbreviation for "change in". It follows that {{math|1=Δ''y'' = ''m'' Δ''x''}}.

A general function is not a line, so it does not have a slope. Geometrically, the '''derivative of {{math|''f''}} at the point {{math|1=''x'' = ''a''}}''' is the slope of the [[tangent|tangent line]] to the function {{math|''f''}} at the point {{math|''a''}} (see figure). This is often denoted {{math|''f'' ′(''a'')}} in [[Notation for differentiation#Lagrange's notation|Lagrange's notation]] or {{math|1={{sfrac|''dy''|''dx''}}{{Pipe}}&lt;sub&gt;''x'' = ''a''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in [[Leibniz's notation]]. Since the derivative is the slope of the linear approximation to {{math|''f''}} at the point {{math|''a''}}, the derivative (together with the value of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}) determines the best linear approximation, or [[linearization]], of {{math|''f''}} near the point {{math|''a''}}.

If every point {{math|''a''}} in the domain of {{math|''f''}} has a derivative, there is a function that sends every point {{math|''a''}} to the derivative of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''a''}}. For example, if  {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then the derivative function {{math|1=''f'' ′(''x'') = {{sfrac|''dy''|''dx''}} = 2''x''}}.

A closely related notion is the [[differential (mathematics)|differential]] of a function. When {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are real variables, the derivative of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}} is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}}.  Because the source and target of {{math|''f''}} are one-dimensional, the derivative of {{math|''f''}} is a real number. If {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are vectors, then the best linear approximation to the graph of {{math|''f''}} depends on how {{math|''f''}} changes in several directions at once.  Taking the best linear approximation in a single direction determines a [[partial derivative]], which is usually denoted {{math|{{sfrac|∂''y''|∂''x''}}}}.  The linearization of {{math|''f''}} in all directions at once is called the [[total derivative]].

==History of differentiation==
{{Main|History of calculus}}

The concept of a derivative in the sense of a [[tangent line]] is a very old one, familiar to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] geometers such as 
[[Euclid]] (c. 300 BC), [[Archimedes]] (c. 287–212 BC) and [[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262–190 BC).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Euclid's Elements]], The [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] and {{MacTutor Biography|id=Apollonius|title=Apollonius of Perga}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archimedes]] also introduced the use of [[infinitesimal]]s, although these were primarily used to study areas and volumes rather than derivatives and tangents; see [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals]].

The use of infinitesimals to study rates of change can be found in [[Indian mathematics]], perhaps as early as 500 AD, when the astronomer and mathematician [[Aryabhata]] (476–550) used infinitesimals to study the [[orbit of the Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Aryabhata_I|title=Aryabhata the Elder}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of infinitesimals to compute rates of change was developed significantly by [[Bhāskara II]] (1114–1185); indeed, it has been argued&lt;ref&gt;Ian G. Pearce. [http://turnbull.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Projects/Pearce/Chapters/Ch8_5.html Bhaskaracharya II.]&lt;/ref&gt; that many of the key notions of differential calculus can be found in his work, such as "[[Rolle's theorem]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=T. A. A.|last=Broadbent|title=Reviewed work(s): ''The History of Ancient Indian Mathematics'' by C. N.

The [[Islamic mathematics|Persian mathematician]], [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī]] (1135–1213), in his ''Treatise on Equations'', established conditions for some cubic equations to have solutions, by finding the maxima of appropriate  cubic polynomials.   He proved, for example, that the maximum of the cubic {{math| ''a x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; — x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} occurs when {{math|''x'' {{=}} 2''a''/3}}, and concluded therefrom that the equation {{math| ''a x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; — ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''c''}} has exactly one positive solution when {{math|''c'' {{=}} 4 ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/27}}, and two positive solutions whenever  {{math|0 &lt; ''c'' &lt; 4 ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/27}}.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Berggren (1990). "Innovation and Tradition in Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi's Muadalat", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''110''' (2), pp. 304-309.&lt;/ref&gt;  The historian of science, [[Roshdi Rashed]],&lt;ref&gt;Cited by J. L. Berggren (1990). "Innovation and Tradition in Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi's Muadalat", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''110''' (2), pp. 304-309.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that al-Tūsī must have used the derivative of the cubic to obtain this result.  Rashed's conclusion has been contested by other scholars, however, who argue that he could have obtained the result by other methods which do not require the derivative of the function to be known.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Berggren (1990). "Innovation and Tradition in Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi's Muadalat", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''110''' (2), pp. 304-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern development of calculus is usually credited to [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] (1646–1716), who provided independent&lt;ref&gt;Newton began his work in 1666 and Leibniz began his in 1676. However, Leibniz published his first paper in 1684, predating Newton's publication in 1693. It is possible that Leibniz saw drafts of Newton's work in 1673 or 1676, or that Newton made use of Leibniz's work to refine his own. Both Newton and Leibniz claimed that the other plagiarized their respective works. This resulted in a bitter [[Newton Leibniz calculus controversy]] between the two men over who first invented calculus which shook the mathematical community in the early 18th century.&lt;/ref&gt; and unified approaches to differentiation and derivatives. The key insight, however, that earned them this credit, was the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] relating differentiation and integration: this rendered obsolete most previous methods for computing areas and volumes,&lt;ref&gt;This was a monumental achievement, even though a restricted version had been proven previously by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1638–1675), and some key examples can be found in the work of [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1601–1665).&lt;/ref&gt; which had not been significantly extended since the time of [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen).&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;Victor J. Katz (1995), "Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India", ''Mathematics Magazine'' '''68''' (3): 163-174 [165-9 &amp; 173-4]&lt;/ref&gt; For their ideas on derivatives, both Newton and Leibniz built on significant earlier work by mathematicians such as [[Pierre de Fermat]] (1607-1665), [[Isaac Barrow]] (1630–1677), [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650), [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629–1695), [[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662) and [[John Wallis]] (1616–1703). Regarding Fermat's influence, Newton once wrote in a letter that "''I had the hint of this method [of fluxions] from Fermat's way of drawing tangents, and by applying it to abstract equations, directly and invertedly, I made it general.''"&lt;ref name=Sabra&gt;{{cite book | last = Sabra | first = A I.|title=Theories of Light: From Descartes to Newton | publisher =  Cambridge University Press | year = 1981 | page = 144 | isbn = 978-0521284363}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Isaac Barrow is generally given credit for the early development of the derivative.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, H. (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Newton and Leibniz remain key figures in the history of differentiation, not least because Newton was the first to apply differentiation to [[theoretical physics]], while Leibniz systematically developed much of the notation still used today.

Since the 17th century many mathematicians have contributed to the theory of differentiation. In the 19th century, calculus was put on a much more rigorous footing by mathematicians such as [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] (1789–1857), [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1826–1866), and [[Karl Weierstrass]] (1815–1897). It was also during this period that the differentiation was generalized to [[Euclidean space]] and the [[complex plane]].

== Applications of derivatives ==

=== Optimization ===
If {{math|''f''}} is a [[differentiable function]] on {{math|ℝ}} (or an [[open interval]]) and {{math|''x''}} is a [[local maximum]] or a [[local minimum]] of {{math|''f''}}, then the derivative of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}} is zero. Points where {{math|''f&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(''x'') {{=}} 0}} are called ''[[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]]'' or ''[[stationary point]]s'' (and the value of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}} is called a ''[[critical value]]'').  If {{math|''f''}} is not assumed to be everywhere differentiable, then points at which it fails to be differentiable are also designated critical points.

If {{math|''f''}} is twice differentiable, then conversely, a critical point {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''f''}} can be analysed by considering the [[second derivative]] of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}} :
* if it is positive, {{math|''x''}} is a local minimum;
* if it is negative, {{math|''x''}} is a local maximum;
* if it is zero, then {{math|''x''}} could be a local minimum, a local maximum, or neither. (For example, {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} has a critical point at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, but it has neither a maximum nor a minimum there, whereas {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ± ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} has a critical point at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and a minimum and a maximum, respectively, there.)
This is called the [[second derivative test]]. An alternative approach, called the [[first derivative test]], involves considering the sign of the {{math|''f&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''}} on each side of the critical point.

Taking derivatives and solving for critical points is therefore often a simple way to find local minima or maxima, which can be useful in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. By the [[extreme value theorem]], a continuous function on a [[closed interval]] must attain its minimum and maximum values at least once. If the function is differentiable, the minima and maxima can only occur at critical points or endpoints.

This also has applications in graph sketching: once the local minima and maxima of a differentiable function have been found, a rough plot of the graph can be obtained from the observation that it will be either increasing or decreasing between critical points.

In [[higher dimension]]s, a critical point of a [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar value]]d function is a point at which the [[gradient]] is zero. The [[second derivative]] test can still be used to analyse critical points by considering the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[Hessian matrix]] of second partial derivatives of the function at the critical point. If all of the eigenvalues are positive, then the point is a local minimum; if all are negative, it is a local maximum. If there are some positive and some negative eigenvalues, then the critical point is called a "[[saddle point]]", and if none of these cases hold (i.e., some of the eigenvalues are zero) then the test is considered to be inconclusive.

==== Calculus of variations ====
{{Main|Calculus of variations}}

One example of an optimization problem is: Find the shortest curve between two points on a surface, assuming that the curve must also lie on the surface. If the surface is a plane, then the shortest curve is a line. But if the surface is, for example, egg-shaped, then the [[Shortest path problem|shortest path]] is not immediately clear. These paths are called [[geodesic]]s, and one of the simplest problems in the calculus of variations is finding geodesics. Another example is: Find the smallest area surface filling in a closed curve in space. This surface is called a [[minimal surface]] and it, too, can be found using the calculus of variations.

=== Physics ===
Calculus is of vital importance in physics: many physical processes are described by equations involving derivatives, called [[differential equation]]s. Physics is particularly concerned with the way quantities change and develop over time, and the concept of the "'''[[time derivative]]'''" &amp;mdash; the rate of change over time &amp;mdash; is essential for the precise definition of several important concepts. In particular, the time derivatives of an object's position are significant in [[Newtonian physics]]:

* [[velocity]] is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's displacement (distance from the original position)
* [[acceleration]] is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's velocity, that is, the second derivative (with respect to time) of an object's position.

For example, if an object's position on a line is given by

: &lt;math&gt;x(t) = -16t^2 + 16t + 32 , \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

then the object's velocity is

: &lt;math&gt;\dot x(t) = x'(t) = -32t + 16, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and the object's acceleration is

: &lt;math&gt;\ddot x(t) = x''(t) = -32, \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is constant.

=== Differential equations ===
{{Main|Differential equation}}

A differential equation is a relation between a collection of functions and their derivatives.  An '''[[ordinary differential equation]]''' is a differential equation that relates functions of one variable to their derivatives with respect to that variable.  A '''[[partial differential equation]]''' is a differential equation that relates functions of more than one variable to their [[partial derivative]]s.  Differential equations arise naturally in the physical sciences, in mathematical modelling, and within mathematics itself.  For example, [[Newton's second law]], which describes the relationship between acceleration and force, can be stated as the ordinary differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;F(t) = m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
The [[heat equation]] in one space variable, which describes how heat diffuses through a straight rod, is the partial differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here {{math|''u''(''x'',''t'')}} is the temperature of the rod at position {{math|''x''}} and time {{math|''t''}} and {{math|''α''}} is a constant that depends on how fast heat diffuses through the rod.

=== Mean value theorem ===
{{Main|Mean value theorem}}

[[File:Mvt2.svg|thumb|The mean value theorem: For each differentiable function &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\R&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a&lt;b&lt;/math&gt; there is a &lt;math&gt;c\in(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f'(c) = \tfrac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The mean value theorem gives a relationship between values of the derivative and values of the original function.  If {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is a real-valued function and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are numbers with {{math|''a'' &lt; ''b''}}, then the mean value theorem says that under mild hypotheses, the slope between the two points {{math|(''a'', ''f''(''a''))}} and {{math|(''b'', ''f''(''b''))}} is equal to the slope of the tangent line to {{math|''f''}} at some point {{math|''c''}} between {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}.  In other words,
:&lt;math&gt;f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}.&lt;/math&gt;
In practice, what the mean value theorem does is control a function in terms of its derivative. For instance, suppose that {{math|''f''}} has derivative equal to zero at each point. This means that its tangent line is horizontal at every point, so the function should also be horizontal. The mean value theorem proves that this must be true: The slope between any two points on the graph of {{math|''f''}} must equal the slope of one of the tangent lines of {{math|''f''}}. All of those slopes are zero, so any line from one point on the graph to another point will also have slope zero. But that says that the function does not move up or down, so it must be a horizontal line. More complicated conditions on the derivative lead to less precise but still highly useful information about the original function.

=== Taylor polynomials and Taylor series ===
{{Main|Taylor polynomial|Taylor series}}

The derivative gives the best possible linear approximation of a function at a given point, but this can be very different from the original function. One way of improving the approximation is to take a quadratic approximation. That is to say, the linearization of a real-valued function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} at the point {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a linear [[polynomial]] {{math|''a'' + ''b''(''x'' − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and it may be possible to get a better approximation by considering a quadratic polynomial {{math|''a'' + ''b''(''x'' − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''c''(''x'' − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Still better might be a cubic polynomial {{math|''a'' + ''b''(''x'' − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''c''(''x'' − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''d''(''x'' − ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and this idea can be extended to arbitrarily high degree polynomials. For each one of these polynomials, there should be a best possible choice of coefficients {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}}, and {{math|''d''}} that makes the approximation as good as possible.

In the [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, for {{math|''a''}} the best possible choice is always {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and for {{math|''b''}} the best possible choice is always {{math|''f&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.  For {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''d''}}, and higher-degree coefficients, these coefficients are determined by higher derivatives of {{math|''f''}}.  {{math|''c''}} should always be {{math|{{sfrac|''f&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)|2}}}}, and {{math|''d''}} should always be {{math|{{sfrac|''f&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)|3!}}}}. Using these coefficients gives the '''Taylor polynomial''' of {{math|''f''}}. The Taylor polynomial of degree {{math|''d''}} is the polynomial of degree {{math|''d''}} which best approximates {{math|''f''}}, and its coefficients can be found by a generalization of the above formulas. [[Taylor's theorem]] gives a precise bound on how good the approximation is. If {{math|''f''}} is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to {{math|''d''}}, then the Taylor polynomial of degree {{math|''d''}} equals {{math|''f''}}.

The limit of the Taylor polynomials is an infinite series called the '''Taylor series'''. The Taylor series is frequently a very good approximation to the original function. Functions which are equal to their Taylor series are called [[analytic function]]s.  It is impossible for functions with discontinuities or sharp corners to be analytic, but there are [[smooth function]]s which are not analytic.

=== Implicit function theorem ===
{{Main|Implicit function theorem}}

Some natural geometric shapes, such as [[circle]]s, cannot be drawn as the [[graph of a function]].  For instance, if {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}, then the circle is the set of all pairs {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} such that {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}}.  This set is called the zero set of {{math|''f''}}. It is not the same as the graph of {{math|''f''}}, which is a [[paraboloid]]. The implicit function theorem converts relations such as {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} 0}} into functions. It states that if {{math|''f''}} is [[continuously differentiable]], then around most points, the zero set of {{math|''f''}} looks like graphs of functions pasted together. The points where this is not true are determined by a condition on the derivative of {{math|''f''}}. The circle, for instance, can be pasted together from the graphs of the two functions {{math|± {{sqrt|1 - ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}. In a neighborhood of every point on the circle except {{nobreak|(−1, 0)}} and {{nobreak|(1, 0)}}, one of these two functions has a graph that looks like the circle. (These two functions also happen to meet {{nobreak|(−1, 0)}} and {{nobreak|(1, 0)}}, but this is not guaranteed by the implicit function theorem.)

The implicit function theorem is closely related to the [[inverse function theorem]], which states when a function looks like graphs of [[invertible function]]s pasted together.

'''Amalie Emmy Noether'''&lt;ref name=Rufname group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Emmy (given name)|Emmy]] is the ''[[Rufname]]'', the second of two official given names, intended for daily use. Cf. for example the résumé submitted by Noether to Erlangen University in 1907 (Erlangen University archive, ''Promotionsakt Emmy Noether'' (1907/08, NR. 2988); reproduced in: ''Emmy Noether, Gesammelte Abhandlungen – Collected Papers,'' ed. N. Jacobson 1983; online facsimile at [http://www.physikerinnen.de/noetherlebenslauf.html physikerinnen.de/noetherlebenslauf.html]). Sometimes ''Emmy'' is mistakenly reported as a short form for ''Amalie'', or misreported as "Emily". e.g. {{Citation | url = http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge52.html | author-link = Lee Smolin | first = Lee | last = Smolin | work = Edge | title = Special Relativity – Why Can't You Go Faster Than Light? | quote = Emily Noether, a great German mathematician}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-de|ˈnøːtɐ|lang}}; 23 March 1882 – 14 April 1935) was a German [[mathematician]] who made important contributions to [[abstract algebra]] and [[theoretical physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/emmy-noether-theorem-legacy-physics-math |title=Emmy Noether changed the face of physics; Noether linked two important concepts in physics: conservation laws and symmetries |author=Emily Conover |date=12 June 2018 |website=[[Sciencenews.org]] |publisher= |access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She invariably used the name "Emmy Noether" in her life and publications.&lt;ref name=Rufname group=lower-alpha/&gt; She was described by [[Pavel Alexandrov]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Jean Dieudonné]], [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[Norbert Wiener]] as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.&lt;ref name = "einstein" /&gt;{{sfn|Alexandrov|1981|p=100}} As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, she developed the theories of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[algebra over a field|algebras]]. In physics, [[Noether's theorem]] explains the connection between [[symmetry in physics|symmetry]] and [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation laws]].&lt;ref name="neeman_1999"/&gt;

Noether was born to a [[Jewish family]] in the [[Franconia]]n town of [[Erlangen]]; her father was a mathematician, [[Max Noether]]. She originally planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations, but instead studied mathematics at the [[University of Erlangen]], where her father lectured. After completing her dissertation in 1907 under the supervision of [[Paul Gordan]], she worked at the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years. At the time, women were largely excluded from academic positions. In 1915, she was invited by [[David Hilbert]] and [[Felix Klein]] to join the mathematics department at the [[University of Göttingen]], a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The philosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert's name. Her ''[[habilitation]]'' was approved in 1919, allowing her to obtain the rank of ''[[Privatdozent]]''.

Noether remained a leading member of the [[Göttingen]] mathematics department until 1933; her students were sometimes called the "Noether boys". In 1924, Dutch mathematician [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B. L. van der Waerden]] joined her circle and soon became the leading expositor of Noether's ideas: Her work was the foundation for the second volume of his influential 1931 textbook, ''[[Moderne Algebra]]''. By the time of her plenary address at the 1932 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Zürich]], her algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. The following year, Germany's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, and Noether moved to the United States to take up a position at [[Bryn Mawr College]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. In 1935 she underwent surgery for an [[ovarian cyst]] and, despite signs of a recovery, died four days later at the age of 53.

Noether's mathematical work has been divided into three "epochs".&lt;ref name=Weyl&gt;{{Harvnb|Weyl|1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first (1908–1919), she made contributions to the theories of [[algebraic invariant]]s and [[field (mathematics)|number fields]]. Her work on differential invariants in the [[calculus of variations]], ''[[Noether's theorem]]'', has been called "one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics".{{Sfn |Lederman|Hill|2004|p=73}} In the second epoch (1920–1926), she began work that "changed the face of [abstract] algebra".&lt;ref name="weyl_128"/&gt; In her classic 1921 paper ''Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen'' (''Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains'') Noether developed the theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in [[commutative ring]]s into a tool with wide-ranging applications. She made elegant use of the [[ascending chain condition]], and objects satisfying it are named ''[[Noetherian (disambiguation)|Noetherian]]'' in her honor. In the third epoch (1927–1935), she published works on [[noncommutative algebra]]s and [[hypercomplex number]]s and united the [[representation theory]] of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] with the theory of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and ideals. In addition to her own publications, Noether was generous with her ideas and is credited with several lines of research published by other mathematicians, even in fields far removed from her main work, such as [[algebraic topology]].

==Personal life==
[[File:Erlangen 1916.jpg|thumb|Noether grew up in the Bavarian city of [[Erlangen]], depicted here in a 1916 postcard]]
[[File:NoetherFamily MFO3120.jpg|thumb|Emmy Noether with her brothers Alfred, [[Fritz Noether|Fritz]], and Robert, before 1918]]
Emmy's father, [[Max Noether]], was descended from a family of wholesale traders in Germany. At age 14, he had been paralyzed by [[poliomyelitis|polio]]. He regained mobility, but one leg remained affected. Largely self-taught, he was awarded a [[doctorate]] from the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1868. After teaching there for seven years, he took a position in the Bavarian city of [[Erlangen]], where he met and married Ida Amalia Kaufmann, the daughter of a prosperous merchant.{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|pp=3–5}}{{Sfn |Osen | 1974 |p=142}}{{Sfn |Lederman|Hill|2004|pp=70–71}}{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp=7–9}} 

Max Noether's mathematical contributions were to [[algebraic geometry]] mainly, following in the footsteps of [[Alfred Clebsch]]. His best known results are the [[Brill–Noether theorem]] and the residue, or [[AF+BG theorem]]; several other theorems are associated with him; see [[Max Noether's theorem (disambiguation)|Max Noether's theorem]].

Emmy Noether was born on 23&amp;nbsp;March 1882, the first of four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians |edition=illustrated |first1=Sooyoung |last1=Chang |publisher=World Scientific |year=2011 |isbn=978-981-4282-29-1 |page=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4siw31DPONUC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4siw31DPONUC&amp;pg=PA21 Extract of page 21]&lt;/ref&gt; Her first name was "Amalie", after her mother and paternal grandmother, but she began using her middle name at a young age.

As a girl, Noether was well liked. She did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was [[near-sighted]] and talked with a minor [[lisp]] during childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children's party, showing logical acumen at that early age.{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp= 9–10}} She was taught to cook and clean, as were most girls of the time, and she took piano lessons. She pursued none of these activities with passion, although she loved to dance.{{Sfn|Osen|1974|p= 142}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=10–11}}

She had three younger brothers: The eldest, Alfred, was born in 1883, was awarded a doctorate in [[chemistry]] from Erlangen in 1909, but died nine years later. [[Fritz Noether]], born in 1884, is remembered for his academic accomplishments; after studying in [[Munich]] he made a reputation for himself in [[applied mathematics]]. The youngest, Gustav Robert, was born in 1889. Very little is known about his life; he suffered from chronic illness and died in 1928.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=25,45}}{{Sfn|Kimberling|p=5}}

==University education==
[[File:Paul Albert Gordan.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Gordan]] supervised Noether's doctoral dissertation on [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] of biquadratic forms.]]
Noether showed early proficiency in French and English. In the spring of 1900, she took the examination for teachers of these languages and received an overall score of ''sehr gut'' (very good). Her performance qualified her to teach languages at schools reserved for girls, but she chose instead to continue her studies at the [[University of Erlangen]].

This was an unconventional decision; two years earlier, the Academic Senate of the university had declared that allowing [[mixed-sex education]] would "overthrow all academic order".{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|p=10}} One of only two women in a university of 986&amp;nbsp;students, Noether was only allowed to [[academic audit|audit]] classes rather than participate fully, and required the permission of individual professors whose lectures she wished to attend. Despite these obstacles, on 14&amp;nbsp;July 1903 she passed the graduation exam at a ''[[Realgymnasium]]'' in [[Nuremberg]].{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp=11–12}}{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|pp=8–10}}{{Sfn |Lederman|Hill|2004|p= 71}}

During the 1903–1904 winter semester, she studied at the University of Göttingen, attending lectures given by astronomer [[Karl Schwarzschild]] and mathematicians [[Hermann Minkowski]], [[Otto Blumenthal]], [[Felix Klein]], and [[David Hilbert]]. Soon thereafter, restrictions on women's participation in that university were rescinded.

Noether returned to Erlangen. She officially reentered the university in October 1904, and declared her intention to focus solely on mathematics. Under the supervision of [[Paul Gordan]] she wrote her dissertation, ''Über die Bildung des Formensystems der ternären biquadratischen Form'' (''On Complete Systems of Invariants for Ternary Biquadratic Forms'', 1907). Gordan was a member of the "computational" school of invariant researchers, and Noether's thesis ended with a list of over 300 explicitly worked out invariants. This approach to invariants was later superseded by the more abstract and general approach pioneered by Hilbert.{{Sfn|Sally|Srinavasan|2012|p=164}}{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=10–11}} Although it had been well received, Noether later described her thesis and a number of subsequent similar papers she produced as "crap".{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=10–11}}{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp=13–17}}&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{Harvnb|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=71}} write that she completed her doctorate at Göttingen, but this appears to be an error.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
===University of Erlangen===
For the next seven years (1908–1915) she taught at the University of Erlangen's Mathematical Institute without pay, occasionally substituting for her father when he was too ill to lecture. In 1910 and 1911 she published an extension of her thesis work from three variables to ''n'' variables.

[[File:Emmy noether postcard 1915.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Noether sometimes used postcards to discuss abstract algebra with her colleague, [[Ernst Sigismund Fischer|Ernst Fischer]]. This card is postmarked 10&amp;nbsp;April 1915.]]
Gordan retired in the spring of 1910, but continued to teach occasionally with his successor, [[Erhard Schmidt]], who left shortly afterward for a position in [[Breslau]]. Gordan retired from teaching altogether in 1911 when Schmidt's successor [[Ernst Sigismund Fischer|Ernst Fischer]] arrived; Gordan died a year later in December 1912.

According to [[Hermann Weyl]], Fischer was an important influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her to the work of [[David Hilbert]]. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical objects such as [[field (mathematics)|fields]] of [[rational function]]s and the [[invariant theory|invariants]] of [[finite group]]s. This phase marks the beginning of her engagement with [[abstract algebra]], the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.

Noether and Fischer shared lively enjoyment of mathematics and would often discuss lectures long after they were over; Noether is known to have sent postcards to Fischer continuing her train of mathematical thoughts.{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=11–12}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=18–24}}{{Sfn|Osen|1974|p= 143}}

===University of Göttingen===
In the spring of 1915, Noether was invited to return to the University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and [[Felix Klein]]. Their effort to recruit her, however, was blocked by the [[Philology|philologists]] and [[historian]]s among the philosophical faculty: Women, they insisted, should not become ''[[privatdozent]]''. One faculty member protested: "''What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?''"{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|p=14}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=32}}{{Sfn|Osen|1974|pp=144–45}}{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=72}} Hilbert responded with indignation, stating, "''I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as ''privatdozent''. After all, we are a university, not a bath house.''"{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|p=14}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=32}}{{Sfn|Osen|1974|pp=144–45}}{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=72}}

[[File:Hilbert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In 1915 [[David Hilbert]] invited Noether to join the Göttingen mathematics department, challenging the views of some of his colleagues that a woman should not be allowed to teach at a university.]]
Noether left for Göttingen in late April; two weeks later her mother died suddenly in Erlangen. She had previously received medical care for an eye condition, but its nature and impact on her death is unknown. At about the same time Noether's father retired and her brother joined the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] to serve in [[World War I]]. She returned to Erlangen for several weeks, mostly to care for her aging father.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=24–26}}

During her first years teaching at Göttingen she did not have an official position and was not paid; her family paid for her room and board and supported her academic work. Her lectures often were advertised under Hilbert's name, and Noether would provide "assistance".

Soon after arriving at Göttingen, however, she demonstrated her capabilities by proving the [[theorem]] now known as [[Noether's theorem]], which shows that a [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] is associated with any [[derivative|differentiable]] [[symmetry in physics|symmetry of a physical system]].{{Sfn|Osen|1974|pp=144–45}}{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=72}} The paper was presented by a colleague, F. Klein on 26 July 1918 to a meeting of the Royal Society of Sciences at Göttingen.{{Sfn|Noether|1918c|p=235}} Noether presumably did not present it herself because she was not a member of the society.{{Sfn|Byers|1996|p=2}} American physicists [[Leon M. Lederman]] and [[Christopher T. Hill]] argue in their book ''Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe'' that Noether's theorem is "certainly one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of [[modern physics]], possibly on a par with the [[Pythagorean theorem]]".{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=73}}

[[File:Mathematik Göttingen.jpg|thumb|210px|The mathematics department at the University of Göttingen allowed Noether's ''[[habilitation]]'' in 1919, four years after she had begun lecturing at the school.]]
When World War I ended, the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] brought a significant change in social attitudes, including more rights for women. In 1919 the University of Göttingen allowed Noether to proceed with her ''[[habilitation]]'' (eligibility for tenure). Her oral examination was held in late May, and she successfully delivered her ''habilitation'' lecture in June 1919.

Three years later she received a letter from {{ill|Otto Boelitz|de}}, the [[Prussia]]n Minister for Science, Art, and Public Education, in which he conferred on her the title of ''nicht beamteter ausserordentlicher Professor'' (an untenured professor with limited internal administrative rights and functions{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=188}}). This was an unpaid "extraordinary" professorship, not the higher "ordinary" professorship, which was a civil-service position. Although it recognized the importance of her work, the position still provided no salary. Noether was not paid for her lectures until she was appointed to the special position of ''Lehrbeauftragte für Algebra'' a year later.{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=14–18}}{{Sfn|Osen|1974|p=145}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=33–34}}

==Work in abstract algebra==
Although Noether's theorem had a significant effect upon classical and quantum mechanics, among mathematicians she is best remembered for her contributions to [[abstract algebra]]. In his introduction to Noether's ''Collected Papers'', [[Nathan Jacobson]] wrote that&lt;blockquote&gt;The development of abstract algebra, which is one of the most distinctive innovations of twentieth century mathematics, is largely due to her – in published papers, in lectures, and in personal influence on her contemporaries.{{sfn|Noether|1983}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; She sometimes allowed her colleagues and students to receive credit for her ideas, helping them develop their careers at the expense of her own.{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=74}}{{Sfn |Osen|1974|p=148}}

Noether's work in algebra began in 1920. In collaboration with W. Schmeidler, she then published a paper about the [[ideal theory|theory of ideals]] in which they defined [[Ideal (ring theory)|left and right ideals]] in a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].

The following year she published a paper called ''Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen'', analyzing [[ascending chain condition]]s with regard to (mathematical) ideals. Noted algebraist [[Irving Kaplansky]] called this work "revolutionary";{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|p=18}} the publication gave rise to the term "[[Noetherian ring]]" and the naming of several other mathematical objects as ''[[Noetherian (disambiguation)|Noetherian]]''.{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|p=18}}{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp= 44–45}}{{Sfn |Osen|1974|pp=145–46}}

In 1924 a young Dutch mathematician, [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|B. L. van der Waerden]], arrived at the University of Göttingen. He immediately began working with Noether, who provided invaluable methods of abstract conceptualization. Van der Waerden later said that her originality was "absolute beyond comparison".{{Sfn|van der Waerden|1935|p=100}} In 1931 he published ''Moderne Algebra'', a central text in the field; its second volume borrowed heavily from Noether's work. Although Noether did not seek recognition, he included as a note in the seventh edition "based in part on lectures by [[Emil Artin|E. Artin]] and E. Noether".{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=57–58}}{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|p=19}}{{Sfn|Lederman|Hill|2004|p=74}}

Van der Waerden's visit was part of a convergence of mathematicians from all over the world to Göttingen, which became a major hub of mathematical and physical research. From 1926 to 1930 Russian [[topology|topologist]] [[Pavel Alexandrov]] lectured at the university, and he and Noether quickly became good friends. He began referring to her as ''der Noether'', using the masculine German article as a term of endearment to show his respect. She tried to arrange for him to obtain a position at Göttingen as a regular professor, but was only able to help him secure a scholarship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=24–25}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=61–63}} They met regularly and enjoyed discussions about the intersections of algebra and topology. In his 1935 memorial address, Alexandrov named Emmy Noether "the greatest woman mathematician of all time".{{Sfn|Alexandrov|1981|pp=100, 107}}

==Graduate students and influential lectures==
In addition to her mathematical insight, Noether was respected for her consideration of others. Although she sometimes acted rudely toward those who disagreed with her, she nevertheless gained a reputation for constant helpfulness and patient guidance of new students. Her loyalty to mathematical precision caused one colleague to name her "a severe critic", but she combined this demand for accuracy with a nurturing attitude.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=37–49}} A colleague later described her this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Completely unegotistical and free of vanity, she never claimed anything for herself, but promoted the works of her students above all.{{Sfn|van der Waerden|1935|p= 98}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Göttingen===
[[File:EmmyNoether MFO3096.jpg|thumb|left|Noether c.&amp;nbsp;1930]]
In Göttingen, Noether supervised more than a dozen doctoral students; her first was [[Grete Hermann]], who defended her dissertation in February&amp;nbsp;1925. She later spoke reverently of her "dissertation-mother".{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=51}} Noether also supervised [[Max Deuring]], who distinguished himself as an undergraduate and went on to contribute significantly to the field of [[arithmetic geometry]]; [[Hans Fitting]], remembered for [[Fitting's theorem]] and the [[Fitting lemma]]; and [[Chiungtze C. Tsen|Zeng Jiongzhi]] (also rendered "Chiungtze C. Tsen" in English), who proved [[Tsen's theorem]]. She also worked closely with [[Wolfgang Krull]], who greatly advanced [[commutative algebra]] with his [[Krull's principal ideal theorem|''Hauptidealsatz'']] and his [[Krull dimension|dimension theory]] for commutative rings.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp= 53–57}}

Her frugal lifestyle at first was due to being denied pay for her work; however, even after the university began paying her a small salary in 1923, she continued to live a simple and modest life. She was paid more generously later in her life, but saved half of her salary to bequeath to her nephew, [[Gottfried E. Noether]].{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=46–48}}

Mostly unconcerned about appearance and manners, biographers suggest she focused on her studies. A distinguished algebraist [[Olga Taussky-Todd]] described a luncheon, during which Noether, wholly engrossed in a discussion of mathematics, "gesticulated wildly" as she ate and "spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress, completely unperturbed".{{Sfn|Taussky|1981|p=80}} Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved the handkerchief from her blouse and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematics discussion she was having with other students.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=40–41}}

According to van der Waerden's obituary of Emmy Noether, she did not follow a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students formed the basis for several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Bartel Leendert van der Waerden |last=van der Waerden |first= B.L. |title=Nachruf auf Emmy Noether |trans-title=Obituary of Emmy Noether |journal=Mathematische Annalen |volume= 111 |year=1935 |language=de |pages=469–474 |doi= 10.1007/BF01472233 |url= http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=11&amp;PPN=PPN235181684_0111&amp;DMDID=DMDLOG_0038&amp;L=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903172427/http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=11&amp;PPN=PPN235181684_0111&amp;DMDID=DMDLOG_0038&amp;L=1 |archive-date=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all}} Reprinted in {{harvnb|Dick|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of her colleagues attended her lectures, and she allowed some of her ideas, such as the [[crossed product]] (''verschränktes Produkt'' in German) of associative algebras, to be published by others. Noether was recorded as having given at least five semester-long courses at Göttingen:&lt;ref name="scharlau_49"&gt;Scharlau, W. "Emmy Noether's Contributions to the Theory of Algebras" in {{Harvnb|Teicher|1999|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Winter 1924/1925: ''Gruppentheorie und hyperkomplexe Zahlen'' [''Group Theory and Hypercomplex Numbers'']
* Winter 1927/1928: ''Hyperkomplexe Grössen und Darstellungstheorie'' [''Hypercomplex Quantities and Representation Theory'']
* Summer 1928: ''Nichtkommutative Algebra'' [''Noncommutative Algebra'']
* Summer 1929: ''Nichtkommutative Arithmetik'' [''Noncommutative Arithmetic'']
* Winter 1929/30: ''Algebra der hyperkomplexen Grössen'' [''Algebra of Hypercomplex Quantities'']

These courses often preceded major publications on the same subjects.

Noether spoke quickly – reflecting the speed of her thoughts, many said – and demanded great concentration from her students. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated.{{sfn|Mac Lane|1981|p=77}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=37}} Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.

She developed a close circle of colleagues and students who thought along similar lines and tended to exclude those who did not. "Outsiders" who occasionally visited Noether's lectures usually spent only 30&amp;nbsp;minutes in the room before leaving in frustration or confusion. A regular student said of one such instance: "The enemy has been defeated; he has cleared out."{{sfn|Dick|1981|pp=38–41}}

Noether showed a devotion to her subject and her students that extended beyond the academic day. Once, when the building was closed for a state holiday, she gathered the class on the steps outside, led them through the woods, and lectured at a local coffee house.{{Sfn |Mac Lane|1981|p=71}} Later, after she had been dismissed by the [[Third Reich]], she invited students into her home to discuss their plans for the future and mathematical concepts.{{Sfn |Dick|1981|p= 76}}

===Moscow===
[[File:Paul S Alexandroff 2.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Pavel Alexandrov]]]]
In the winter of 1928–1929 Noether accepted an invitation to [[Moscow State University]], where she continued working with [[Pavel Alexandrov|P. S. Alexandrov]]. In addition to carrying on with her research, she taught classes in abstract algebra and [[algebraic geometry]]. She worked with the topologists, [[Lev Pontryagin]] and [[Nikolai Chebotaryov]], who later praised her contributions to the development of [[Galois theory]].{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=63–64}}{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|p=26}}{{Sfn|Alexandrov|1981|pp=108–110}}

[[File:Moscow 05-2012 Mokhovaya 05.jpg|thumb|right|Noether taught at the [[Moscow State University]] during the winter of 1928–1929.]]
Although politics was not central to her life, Noether took a keen interest in political matters and, according to Alexandrov, showed considerable support for the [[Russian Revolution]]. She was especially happy to see [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] advances in the fields of science and mathematics, which she considered indicative of new opportunities made possible by the [[Bolshevik]] project. This attitude caused her problems in Germany, culminating in her eviction from a [[Pension (lodging)|pension lodging]] building, after student leaders complained of living with "a Marxist-leaning Jewess".{{Sfn|Alexandrov|1981|pp=106–109}}

Noether planned to return to Moscow, an effort for which she received support from Alexandrov. After she left Germany in 1933 he tried to help her gain a chair at Moscow State University through the [[Narkompros|Soviet Education Ministry]]. Although this effort proved unsuccessful, they corresponded frequently during the 1930s, and in 1935 she made plans for a return to the Soviet Union.{{Sfn |Alexandrov|1981|pp=106–109}} Meanwhile, her brother [[Fritz Noether|Fritz]] accepted a position at the Research Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in [[Tomsk]], in the Siberian Federal District of Russia, after losing his job in Germany,{{Sfn|Osen|1974|p=150}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=82–83}} and was subsequently executed during the [[Great Purge]].

==Recognition==
In 1932 Emmy Noether and [[Emil Artin]] received the [[Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award]] for their contributions to mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Noether_Emmy.html |title=Emmy Amalie Noether |accessdate=4 September 2008 |type=biography |publisher=St And. |location = UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize carried a monetary reward of 500&amp;nbsp;[[German Reichsmark|Reichsmarks]] and was seen as a long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, her colleagues expressed frustration at the fact that she was not elected to the [[Göttingen Academy of Sciences|Göttingen ''Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften'']] (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of ''Ordentlicher Professor''{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=72–73}}{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|pp=26–27}} (full professor).{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=188}}

[[File:Zuerich vier Kirchen.jpg|thumb|left|Noether visited [[Zürich]] in 1932 to deliver a [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|plenary address at the International Congress of Mathematicians]].]]
Noether's colleagues celebrated her fiftieth birthday in 1932, in typical mathematicians' style. [[Helmut Hasse]] dedicated an article to her in the ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'', wherein he confirmed her suspicion that some aspects of [[noncommutative algebra]] are simpler than those of [[commutative algebra]], by proving a noncommutative [[quadratic reciprocity|reciprocity law]].{{Sfn|Hasse|1933|p=731}} This pleased her immensely. He also sent her a mathematical riddle, which he called the "m&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;-riddle of syllables". She solved immediately, but the riddle has been lost.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=72–73}}{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=26–27}}

In November of the same year, Noether delivered a plenary address (''großer Vortrag'') on "Hyper-complex systems in their relations to commutative algebra and to number theory" at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Zürich]]. The congress was attended by 800&amp;nbsp;people, including Noether's colleagues [[Hermann Weyl]], [[Edmund Landau]], and [[Wolfgang Krull]]. There were 420&amp;nbsp;official participants and twenty-one plenary addresses presented. Apparently, Noether's prominent speaking position was a recognition of the importance of her contributions to mathematics. The 1932&amp;nbsp;congress is sometimes described as the high point of her career.{{sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=26–27}}{{sfn|Dick|1981|pp=74–75}}

==Expulsion from Göttingen by the Third Reich==
When [[Adolf Hitler]] became the [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|German ''Reichskanzler'']] in January&amp;nbsp;1933, [[Nazi]] activity around the country increased dramatically. At the University of Göttingen the German Student Association led the attack on the "un-German spirit" attributed to Jews and was aided by a [[privatdozent]] named [[Werner Weber (mathematician)|Werner Weber]], a former student of Noether. [[Antisemitism|Antisemitic]] attitudes created a climate hostile to Jewish professors. One young protester reportedly demanded: "''Aryan students want Aryan mathematics and not Jewish mathematics''."&lt;ref name="kim29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kimberling|1981|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first actions of Hitler's administration was the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs unless they had "demonstrated their loyalty to Germany" by serving in World War&amp;nbsp;I. In April&amp;nbsp;1933 Noether received a notice from the Prussian Ministry for Sciences, Art, and Public Education which read: "''On the basis of paragraph&amp;nbsp;3 of the Civil Service Code of 7&amp;nbsp;April 1933, I hereby withdraw from you the right to teach at the University of Göttingen''."{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=75–76}}{{sfn |Kimberling|1981|pp=28–29}} Several of Noether's colleagues, including [[Max Born]] and [[Richard Courant]], also had their positions revoked.{{sfn|Dick|1981|pp=75–76}}{{sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=28–29}}

Noether accepted the decision calmly, providing support for others during this difficult time. [[Hermann Weyl]] later wrote that "Emmy Noether—her courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spirit—was in the midst of all the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace."&lt;ref name="kim29"/&gt; Typically, Noether remained focused on mathematics, gathering students in her apartment to discuss [[class field theory]]. When one of her students appeared in the uniform of the Nazi [[paramilitary]] organization ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), she showed no sign of agitation and, reportedly, even laughed about it later.{{sfn|Dick|1981|pp=75–76}}{{sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=28–29}} This, however, was before the bloody events of [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, and their praise from Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]].

==Refuge at Bryn Mawr and Princeton, in America==
[[File:Bryn Mawr Sunset.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bryn Mawr College]] provided a welcoming home for Noether during the last two&amp;nbsp;years of her life.]]
As dozens of newly unemployed professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their colleagues in the United States sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for them. [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] were appointed by the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal [[immigration]]. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions: [[Bryn Mawr College]], in the United States, and [[Somerville College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], in England. After a series of negotiations with the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=78–79}}{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp= 30–31}}

At Bryn Mawr, Noether met and befriended [[Anna Johnson Pell Wheeler|Anna Wheeler]], who had studied at Göttingen just before Noether arrived there. Another source of support at the college was the Bryn Mawr president, Marion Edwards Park, who enthusiastically invited mathematicians in the area to "see Dr.&amp;nbsp;Noether in action!"{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|pp=32–33}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=80}} Noether and a small team of students worked quickly through van der Waerden's 1930 book ''Moderne Algebra&amp;nbsp;I'' and parts of [[Erich Hecke]]'s ''Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen'' (''Theory of algebraic numbers'').{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=80–81}}

In 1934, Noether began lecturing at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton upon the invitation of [[Abraham Flexner]] and [[Oswald Veblen]]. She also worked with and supervised [[Abraham Adrian Albert|Abraham Albert]] and [[Harry Vandiver]].{{Sfn|Dick|1981|pp=81–82}} However, she remarked about [[Princeton University]] that she was not welcome at "the men's university, where nothing female is admitted".{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=81}}

Her time in the United States was pleasant, surrounded as she was by supportive colleagues and absorbed in her favorite subjects.{{Sfn|Osen|1974|p=151}}{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=83}} In the summer of 1934 she briefly returned to Germany to see Emil Artin and her brother [[Fritz Noether|Fritz]] before he left for Tomsk. Although many of her former colleagues had been forced out of the universities, she was able to use the library as a "foreign scholar".{{Sfn|Dick|1981|p=82}}{{Sfn|Kimberling|1981|p=34}}

==Death==
[[File:Bryn Mawr College Cloisters.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Noether's remains were placed under the walkway surrounding the cloisters of Bryn Mawr's [[Bryn Mawr College#M. Carey Thomas Library|M. Carey Thomas Library]].]]
In April 1935 doctors discovered a [[tumor]] in Noether's [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. Worried about complications from surgery, they ordered two days of bed rest first. During the operation they discovered an [[ovarian cyst]] "the size of a large [[cantaloupe]]".{{Sfn |Kimberling| 1981| pp= 37–38}} Two smaller tumors in her [[uterus]] appeared to be benign and were not removed, to avoid prolonging surgery. For three days she appeared to convalesce normally, and she recovered quickly from a [[circulatory collapse]] on the fourth. On 14 April she fell unconscious, her temperature soared to {{convert |109|°F|°C|sigfig=3}}, and she died. "[I]t is not easy to say what had occurred in Dr. Noether", one of the physicians wrote. "It is possible that there was some form of unusual and virulent infection, which struck the base of the brain where the heat centers are supposed to be located."{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|pp= 37–38}}

A few days after Noether's death her friends and associates at Bryn Mawr held a small memorial service at College President Park's house. Hermann Weyl and [[Richard Brauer]] traveled from Princeton and spoke with Wheeler and Taussky about their departed colleague. In the months that followed, written tributes began to appear around the globe: Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=THE LATE EMMY NOETHER.; Professor Einstein Writes in Appreciation of a Fellow-Mathematician.|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9807EFDD163CE33ABC4C53DFB366838E629EDE|accessdate=24 March 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=4 May 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; joined van der Waerden, Weyl, and [[Pavel Alexandrov]] in paying their respects. Her body was cremated and the ashes interred under the walkway around the cloisters of the [[Bryn Mawr College#M. Carey Thomas Library|M. Carey Thomas Library]] at Bryn Mawr.{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|p= 39}}

==Contributions to mathematics and physics==
Noether's work in [[abstract algebra]] and [[topology]] was influential in mathematics, while in physics, [[Noether's theorem]] has consequences for [[theoretical physics]] and [[dynamical system]]s. She showed an acute propensity for abstract thought, which allowed her to approach problems of mathematics in fresh and original ways.{{Sfn |Osen|1974|pp=148–149}}{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|pp=11–12}} Her friend and colleague [[Hermann Weyl]] described her scholarly output in three epochs:
{{Quote |Emmy Noether's scientific production fell into three clearly distinct epochs:

(1) the period of relative dependence, 1907–1919

(2) the investigations grouped around the general theory of ideals 1920–1926

(3) the study of the non-commutative algebras, their representations by linear transformations, and their application to the study of commutative number fields and their arithmetics|{{Harvnb |Weyl| 1935}}}}

In the first epoch (1907–1919), Noether dealt primarily with [[invariant theory|differential and algebraic invariants]], beginning with her dissertation under [[Paul Gordan]]. Her mathematical horizons broadened, and her work became more general and abstract, as she became acquainted with the work of [[David Hilbert]], through close interactions with a successor to Gordan, [[Ernst Sigismund Fischer]]. After moving to Göttingen in 1915, she produced her work for physics, the two [[Noether's theorem]]s.

In the second epoch (1920–1926), Noether devoted herself to developing the theory of [[ring (mathematics)|mathematical rings]].{{Sfn |Gilmer|1981|p= 131}}

In the third epoch (1927–1935), Noether focused on [[noncommutative algebra]], [[linear map|linear transformations]], and commutative number fields.{{Sfn |Kimberling|1981|pp= 10–23}}

Although the results of Noether's first epoch were impressive and useful, her fame among mathematicians rests more on the groundbreaking work she did in her second and third epochs, as noted by Hermann Weyl and B. L. van der Waerden in their obituaries of her.

In these epochs, she was not merely applying ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions that would be used by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], generalizing earlier work of [[Richard Dedekind]]. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as [[elimination theory]] and the [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] that had been studied by her father.

===Historical context===
In the century from 1832 to Noether's death in 1935, the field of mathematics – specifically [[algebra]] – underwent a profound revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., [[cubic function|cubic]], [[quartic equation|quartic]], and [[quintic equation]]s, as well as on the [[root of unity|related problem]] of constructing [[regular polygon]]s using [[compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]. Beginning with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s 1832 proof that [[prime number]]s such as five can be [[integer factorization|factored]] in [[Gaussian integer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. F. |last=Gauss |author-link=Carl Friedrich Gauss |title=Theoria residuorum biquadraticorum – Commentatio secunda |year=1832 |language=la |journal=Comm. Soc. Reg. Sci.

Gauss |publisher=Georg Olms Verlag |location=Hildesheim |year=1973 |pages=93–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Évariste Galois]]'s introduction of [[permutation group]]s in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846, by Liouville), [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s discovery of [[quaternion]]s in 1843, and [[Arthur Cayley]]'s more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned to determining the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether's most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, [[abstract algebra]].&lt;ref name="algebra_contributions_paramount"&gt;G.E. {{Harvnb|Noether|1987|p=168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background on abstract algebra and ''begriffliche Mathematik'' (conceptual mathematics)===
Two of the most basic objects in abstract algebra are groups and rings.

A ''group'' consists of a set of elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be [[associativity|associative]], there must be an [[identity element]] (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an [[inverse element]].

A ''ring'' likewise, has a set of elements, but now has ''two'' operations. The first operation must make the set a group, and the second operation is associative and [[distributivity|distributive]] with respect to the first operation. It may or may not be [[commutativity|commutative]]; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first – the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a [[multiplicative inverse]] (an element ''x'' such that ''a&amp;#x202f;x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x&amp;#x202f;a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;), the ring is called a ''[[division ring]]''. A ''[[field (mathematics)|field]]'' is defined as a commutative division ring.

Groups are frequently studied through ''[[group representation]]s''. In their most general form, these consist of a choice of group, a set, and an ''action'' of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes an element of the group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a [[vector space]], and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.

A powerful way of studying rings is through their ''[[module (mathematics)|modules]]''. A module consists of a choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes an element of the ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module.

The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an ''[[algebra over a field|algebra]]''. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.

Words such as "element" and "combining operation" are very general, and can be applied to many real-world and abstract situations. Any set of things that obeys all the rules for one (or two) operation(s) is, by definition, a group (or ring), and obeys all theorems about groups (or rings). Integer numbers, and the operations of addition and multiplication, are just one example. For example, the elements might be [[Word (data type)|computer data words]], where the first combining operation is [[exclusive or]] and the second is [[logical conjunction]]. Theorems of abstract algebra are powerful because they are general; they govern many systems. It might be imagined that little could be concluded about objects defined with so few properties, but precisely therein lay Noether's gift to discover the maximum that could be concluded from a given set of properties, or conversely, to identify the minimum set, the essential properties responsible for a particular observation. Unlike most mathematicians, she did not make abstractions by generalizing from known examples; rather, she worked directly with the abstractions. In his obituary of Noether, her student van&amp;nbsp;der&amp;nbsp;Waerden recalled that
{{quote |The maxim by which Emmy Noether was guided throughout her work might be formulated as follows: "''Any relationships between numbers, functions, and operations become transparent, generally applicable, and fully productive only after they have been isolated from their particular objects and been formulated as universally valid concepts.''"{{sfn|Dick|1981|p=101}} }}

This is the ''begriffliche Mathematik'' (purely conceptual mathematics) that was characteristic of Noether. This style of mathematics was consequently adopted by other mathematicians, especially in the (then new) field of abstract algebra.

===Example: Integers as a ring===
The [[integer]]s form a commutative ring whose elements are the integers, and the combining operations are addition and multiplication. Any pair of integers can be [[addition|added]] or [[multiplication|multiplied]], always resulting in another integer, and the first operation, addition, is [[commutativity|commutative]], i.e., for any elements ''a'' and ''b'' in the ring, ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''a''. The second operation, multiplication, also is commutative, but that need not be true for other rings, meaning that ''a'' combined with ''b'' might be different from ''b'' combined with ''a''. Examples of noncommutative rings include [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] and [[quaternion]]s. The integers do not form a division ring, because the second operation cannot always be inverted; there is no integer ''a'' such that 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

The integers have additional properties which do not generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into [[prime number]]s. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the ''[[Lasker–Noether theorem]]'', for the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay in determining what properties ''do'' hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.

===First epoch (1908–1919): Algebraic invariant theory===
[[File:Emmy Noether - Table of invariants 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Table&amp;nbsp;2 from Noether's dissertation {{Sfn|Noether|1908}} on invariant theory. This table collects 202 of the 331&amp;nbsp;invariants of ternary biquadratic forms. These forms are graded in two variables ''x'' and ''u''. The horizontal direction of the table lists the invariants with increasing grades in ''x'', while the vertical direction lists them with increasing grades in ''u''.]]
Much of Noether's work in the first epoch of her career was associated with [[invariant theory]], principally [[algebraic invariant theory]]. Invariant theory is concerned with expressions that remain constant (invariant) under a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of transformations. As an everyday example, if a rigid yardstick is rotated, the coordinates (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of its endpoints change, but its length ''L'' given by the formula  ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Δ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; remains the same. Invariant theory was an active area of research in the later nineteenth century, prompted in part by [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]], according to which different types of [[geometry]] should be characterized by their invariants under transformations, e.g., the [[cross-ratio]] of [[projective geometry]].

An example of an ''invariant'' is the [[discriminant]] ''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4&amp;#x202f;''A&amp;#x202f;C'' of a binary [[quadratic form]] '''x·'''A&amp;#x202f;'''x'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''y·'''B&amp;#x202f;'''x'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''y·'''C&amp;#x202f;'''y'''&amp;nbsp;, where '''x''' and '''y''' are [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] and "'''·'''" is the [[dot product]] or "[[inner product]]" for the vectors. A, B, and C are [[linear operator]]s on the vectors – typically [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].

The discriminant is called "invariant" because it is not changed by linear substitutions '''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;#x202f;'''''x'''''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;#x202f;'''''y''''', ''y''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;#x202f;'''x'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''d''&amp;#x202f;'''y''' with determinant ''a''&amp;#x202f;''d''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;#x202f;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;. These substitutions form the [[special linear group]] ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;There are no invariants under the [[general linear group]] of all invertible linear transformations because these transformations can be multiplication by a scaling factor. To remedy this, classical invariant theory also considered ''relative invariants'', which were forms invariant up to a scale factor.&lt;/ref&gt;

One can ask for all polynomials in A, B, and C that are unchanged by the action of ''SL''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; these are called the invariants of binary quadratic forms and turn out to be the polynomials in the discriminant.

More generally, one can ask for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#x202f;''x''&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#x202f;''y''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;A&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#x202f;x&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#x202f;''y''&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; of higher degree, which will be certain polynomials in the coefficients A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;A&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and more generally still, one can ask the similar question for homogeneous polynomials in more than two variables.

One of the main goals of invariant theory was to solve the "''finite basis problem''". The sum or product of any two invariants is invariant, and the finite basis problem asked whether it was possible to get all the invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants, called ''generators'', and then, adding or multiplying the generators together. For example, the discriminant gives a finite basis (with one element) for the invariants of binary quadratic forms.

Noether's advisor, Paul Gordan, was known as the "king of invariant theory", and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of the finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables.{{sfn |Noether|1914|p=11}}{{Sfn |Gordan| 1870}} He proved this by giving a constructive method for finding all of the invariants and their generators, but was not able to carry out this constructive approach for invariants in three or more variables. In 1890, David Hilbert proved a similar statement for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables.{{Sfn | Weyl | 1944|pp = 618–21}}{{Sfn |Hilbert|1890|p= 531}} Furthermore, his method worked, not only for the special linear group, but also for some of its subgroups such as the [[special orthogonal group]].{{Sfn |Hilbert | 1890 | p = 532}}

===First epoch (1908–1919): Galois theory===
[[Galois theory]] concerns transformations of [[field (mathematics)|number fields]] that [[permutation|permute]] the roots of an equation. Consider a polynomial equation of a variable ''x'' of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] ''n'', in which the coefficients are drawn from some [[ground field]], which might be, for example, the field of [[real number]]s, [[rational number]]s, or the [[integer]]s [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]&amp;nbsp;7. There may or may not be choices of ''x'', which make this polynomial evaluate to zero. Such choices, if they exist, are called [[root of a function|roots]]. If the polynomial is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and the field is the real numbers, then the polynomial has no roots, because any choice of ''x'' makes the polynomial greater than or equal to one. If the field is [[field extension|extended]], however, then the polynomial may gain roots, and if it is extended enough, then it always has a number of roots equal to its degree.

Continuing the previous example, if the field is enlarged to the complex numbers, then the polynomial gains two roots, +''i'' and &amp;minus;''i'', where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]], that is, ''i''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&amp;nbsp;. More generally, the extension field in which a polynomial can be factored into its roots is known as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial.

The [[Galois group]] of a polynomial is the set of all transformations of the splitting field which preserve the ground field and the roots of the polynomial. (In mathematical jargon, these transformations are called [[automorphism]]s.) The Galois group of {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}} consists of two elements: The identity transformation, which sends every complex number to itself, and [[complex conjugation]], which sends +''i'' to &amp;minus;''i''. Since the Galois group does not change the ground field, it leaves the coefficients of the polynomial unchanged, so it must leave the set of all roots unchanged. Each root can move to another root, however, so transformation determines a [[permutation]] of the ''n'' roots among themselves. The significance of the Galois group derives from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which proves that the fields lying between the ground field and the splitting field are in one-to-one correspondence with the [[subgroup]]s of the Galois group.

In 1918, Noether published a paper on the [[inverse Galois problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|1918}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of determining the Galois group of transformations of a given field and its extension, Noether asked whether, given a field and a group, it always is possible to find an extension of the field that has the given group as its Galois group. She reduced this to "[[Noether's problem]]", which asks whether the fixed field of a subgroup ''G'' of the [[symmetric group|permutation group]] ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; acting on the field  ''k''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) always is a pure [[transcendental extension]] of the field ''k''. (She first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|1913}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where she attributed the problem to her colleague [[Ernst Sigismund Fischer|Fischer]].) She showed this was true for  ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, 3, or 4. In 1969, [[R. G. Swan]] found a counter-example to Noether's problem, with  ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;47 and ''G'' a [[cyclic group]] of order&amp;nbsp;47&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swan|1969|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (although this group can be realized as a [[Galois group]] over the rationals in other ways). The inverse Galois problem remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Malle|Matzat|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First epoch (1908–1919): Physics===
{{main|Noether's theorem|Conservation law (physics)|Constant of motion}}

Noether was brought to [[Göttingen]] in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her expertise in invariant theory to help them in understanding [[general relativity]], a geometrical theory of [[gravitation]] developed mainly by [[Albert Einstein]]. Hilbert had observed that the [[conservation of energy]] seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern [[theoretical physics]], with [[Noether's theorem|Noether's first theorem]], which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|1918b}}&lt;/ref&gt; She not only solved the problem for general relativity, but also determined the conserved quantities for ''every'' system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry. Upon receiving her work, Einstein wrote to Hilbert:{{quote|Yesterday I received from Miss Noether a very interesting paper on invariants. I'm impressed that such things can be understood in such a general way. The old guard at Göttingen should take some lessons from Miss Noether! She seems to know her stuff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kimberling|1981|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For illustration, if a physical system behaves the same, regardless of how it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the [[angular momentum]] of the system must be conserved.&lt;ref name="ledhill"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lederman|Hill|2004|pp=97–116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space [[Conservation of angular momentum|conserves angular momentum]] despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the ''physical laws'' governing the system is responsible for the conservation law. As another example, if a physical experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation laws]] of [[momentum|linear momentum]] and [[energy]] within this system, respectively.

Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern [[theoretical physics]], both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool.&lt;ref name="neeman_1999"&gt;{{citation |author-link=Yuval Ne'eman |last=Ne'eman |first=Yuval |title=The Impact of Emmy Noether's Theorems on XXIst Century Physics}} in Teicher (1999){{Harvnb|Teicher|1999|pp=83–101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon:&lt;blockquote&gt;If the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Second epoch (1920–1926): Ascending and descending chain conditions===
In this epoch, Noether became famous for her deft use of ascending (''Teilerkettensatz'') or descending (''Vielfachenkettensatz'') chain conditions. A sequence of [[empty set|non-empty]] [[subset]]s ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is usually said to be ''ascending'', if each is a subset of the next
:&lt;math&gt;A_{1} \subset A_{2} \subset A_{3} \subset \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, a sequence of subsets of ''S'' is called ''descending'' if each contains the next subset:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{1} \supset A_{2} \supset A_{3} \supset \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

A chain ''becomes constant after a finite number of steps'' if there is an ''n'' such that &lt;math&gt;A_n = A_m&lt;/math&gt; for all ''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''n''. A collection of subsets of a given set satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]] if any ascending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps. It satisfies the descending chain condition if any descending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps.

Ascending and descending chain conditions are general, meaning that they can be applied to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they might not seem very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage.

For example: How to use chain conditions to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.

Many types of objects in [[abstract algebra]] can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called ''[[Noetherian (disambiguation)|Noetherian]]'' in her honor. By definition, a [[Noetherian ring]] satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a [[Noetherian group]] is defined as a group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A [[Noetherian module]] is a [[module (mathematics)|module]] in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A [[Noetherian space]] is a [[topological space]] in which every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.

The chain condition often is "inherited" by sub-objects. For example, all subspaces of a Noetherian space, are Noetherian themselves; all subgroups and quotient groups of a Noetherian group are likewise, Noetherian; and, ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'', the same holds for submodules and quotient modules of a Noetherian module. All quotient rings of a Noetherian ring are Noetherian, but that does not necessarily hold for its subrings. The chain condition also may be inherited by combinations or extensions of a Noetherian object. For example, finite direct sums of Noetherian rings are Noetherian, as is the ring of formal [[power series]] over a Noetherian ring.

Another application of such chain conditions is in [[Noetherian induction]]—also known as [[well-founded induction]]—which is a generalization of [[mathematical induction]]. It frequently is used to reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that ''S'' is a [[partially ordered set]]. One way of proving a statement about the objects of ''S'' is to assume the existence of a [[counterexample]] and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the [[contrapositive]] of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of ''S'' contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the ''minimal counterexample''. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counter-example, there is a smaller counter-example.

===Second epoch (1920–1926): Commutative rings, ideals, and modules===
Noether's paper, ''Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen'' (''Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains'', 1921),{{Sfn | Noether | 1921}} is the foundation of general commutative ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a [[commutative ring]].&lt;ref name="Gil133"/&gt; Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]], every ideal is finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician [[Claude Chevalley]] coined the term, ''[[Noetherian ring]]'', to describe this property.&lt;ref name="Gil133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gilmer|1981|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A major result in Noether's 1921 paper is the '''[[Lasker–Noether theorem]]''', which extends Lasker's theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of [[prime number]]s, and that this decomposition is unique.

Noether's work ''Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern'' (''Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in Algebraic Number and Function Fields'', 1927)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|1927}}.&lt;/ref&gt; characterized the rings in which the ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as the [[Dedekind domain]]s: integral domains that are Noetherian, 0- or 1-[[Krull dimension|dimensional]], and [[Integrality|integrally closed]] in their quotient fields. This paper also contains what now are called the [[isomorphism theorem]]s, which describe some fundamental [[natural isomorphism]]s, and some other basic results on Noetherian and [[Artinian module]]s.

===Second epoch (1920–1926): Elimination theory===
In 1923–1924, Noether applied her ideal theory to [[elimination theory]] in a formulation that she attributed to her student, Kurt Hentzelt. She showed that fundamental theorems about the [[polynomial factorization|factorization of polynomials]] could be carried over directly.{{Sfn |Noether|1923}}{{Sfn |Noether|1923b}}{{sfn |Noether | 1924}} Traditionally, elimination theory is concerned with eliminating one or more variables from a system of polynomial equations, usually by the method of [[resultant]]s.

For illustration, a system of equations often can be written in the form &amp;nbsp; M&amp;#x202f;'''v'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''0''' &amp;nbsp; where a matrix (or [[linear transform]]) &amp;nbsp; M &amp;nbsp; (without the variable ''x'') times a vector '''v''' (that only has non-zero powers of ''x'') is equal to the zero vector, '''0'''. Hence, the [[determinant]] of the matrix &amp;nbsp; M &amp;nbsp; must be zero, providing a new equation in which the variable ''x'' has been eliminated.

===Second epoch (1920–1926): Invariant theory of finite groups===
Techniques such as Hilbert's original non-constructive solution to the finite basis problem could not be used to get quantitative information about the invariants of a group action, and furthermore, they did not apply to all group actions. In her 1915 paper,{{Sfn | Noether| 1915}} Noether found a solution to the finite basis problem for a finite group of transformations &amp;nbsp; ''G'' &amp;nbsp; acting on a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero. Her solution shows that the ring of invariants is generated by homogeneous invariants whose degree is less than, or equal to, the order of the finite group; this is called '''Noether's bound'''. Her paper gave two proofs of Noether's bound, both of which also work when the characteristic of the field is [[coprime]] to &amp;nbsp; |''G''|! &amp;nbsp; (the [[factorial]] of the order &amp;nbsp; |''G''| &amp;nbsp; of the group ''G''). The degrees of generators need not satisfy Noether's bound when the characteristic of the field divides the number &amp;nbsp; |''G''|&amp;nbsp;,{{Sfn |Fleischmann | 2000 |p = 24}} but Noether was not able to determine whether this bound was correct when the characteristic of the field divides &amp;nbsp; |''G''|! &amp;nbsp; but not &amp;nbsp; |''G''|&amp;nbsp;. For many years, determining the truth or falsehood of this bound for this particular case was an open problem, called "Noether's gap". It was finally solved independently by Fleischmann in 2000 and Fogarty in 2001, who both showed that the bound remains true.{{Sfn |Fleischmann|2000|p=25}}{{Sfn | Fogarty |2001|p=5}}

In her 1926 paper,{{Sfn |Noether|1926}} Noether extended Hilbert's theorem to representations of a finite group over any field; the new case that did not follow from Hilbert's work is when the characteristic of the field divides the order of the group. Noether's result was later extended by [[William Haboush]] to all reductive groups by his proof of the [[Haboush's theorem|Mumford conjecture]].{{Sfn |Haboush|1975}} In this paper Noether also introduced the ''[[Noether normalization lemma]]'', showing that a finitely generated [[integral domain|domain]] ''A'' over a field ''k'' has a set &amp;nbsp; {&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;} &amp;nbsp; of [[algebraic independence|algebraically independent]] elements such that ''A'' is [[integrality|integral]] over &amp;nbsp; ''k''&amp;#x202f;[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;... ,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&amp;nbsp;.

===Second epoch (1920–1926): Contributions to topology===
[[File:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|right|250px|A continuous deformation ([[homotopy]]) of a coffee cup into a doughnut ([[torus]]) and back]]
As noted by [[Pavel Alexandrov]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] in their obituaries, Noether's contributions to [[topology]] illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study the properties of objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their [[connected space|connectedness]]. An old joke is that "''a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug''", since they can be continuously deformed into one another.

Noether is credited with fundamental ideas that led to the development of [[algebraic topology]] from the earlier [[combinatorial topology]], specifically, the idea of [[Homology theory#Towards algebraic topology|homology groups]].{{Sfn |Hilton|1988|p=284}} According to the account of Alexandrov, Noether attended lectures given by [[Heinz Hopf]] and by him in the summers of 1926 and 1927, where "she continually made observations which were often deep and subtle"{{Sfn |Dick|1981|p=173}} and he continues that,
{{quote |When ... she first became acquainted with a systematic construction of combinatorial topology, she immediately observed that it would be worthwhile to study directly the [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of algebraic complexes and cycles of a given polyhedron and the [[subgroup]] of the cycle group consisting of cycles homologous to zero; instead of the usual definition of [[Betti number]]s, she suggested immediately defining the Betti group as the [[quotient group|complementary (quotient) group]] of the group of all cycles by the subgroup of cycles homologous to zero. This observation now seems self-evident. But in those years (1925–1928) this was a completely new point of view.{{Sfn | Dick | 1981|p= 174}}}}

Noether's suggestion that topology be studied algebraically was adopted immediately by Hopf, Alexandrov, and others,{{Sfn | Dick | 1981|p= 174}} and it became a frequent topic of discussion among the mathematicians of Göttingen.&lt;ref name = Hirzebruch&gt;[[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch, Friedrich]]. "Emmy Noether and Topology" in {{Harvnb |Teicher|1999|pp=57–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Noether observed that her idea of a [[Betti group]] makes the [[Euler characteristic|Euler–Poincaré formula]] simpler to understand, and Hopf's own work on this subject{{Sfn |Hopf|1928}} "bears the imprint of these remarks of Emmy Noether".{{Sfn |Dick|1981|pp = 174–175}} Noether mentions her own topology ideas only as an aside in a 1926 publication,{{Sfn |Noether | 1926b}} where she cites it as an application of [[group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hirzebruch |first=Friedrich |title=Emmy Noether and Topology}} in {{Harvnb | Teicher|1999|p= 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This algebraic approach to topology was also developed independently in [[Austria]]. In a 1926–1927 course given in [[Vienna]], [[Leopold Vietoris]] defined a [[homology group]], which was developed by [[Walther Mayer]], into an axiomatic definition in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Hirzebruch, Friedrich, "Emmy Noether and Topology" in {{Harvnb |Teicher|1999 | pp = 61–63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Helmut Hasse.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Helmut Hasse]] worked with Noether and others to found the theory of [[central simple algebra]]s.]]

===Third epoch (1927–1935): Hypercomplex numbers and representation theory===
Much work on [[hypercomplex number]]s and [[group representation]]s was carried out in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras.&lt;ref name="noether_1929"&gt;{{harvnb|Noether|1929}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Briefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of [[associative algebra]]s and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] satisfying [[ascending chain condition]]s. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.&lt;ref name="vdWaerden_1985" &gt;{{harvnb|van der Waerden|1985|p = 244}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third epoch (1927–1935): Noncommutative algebra===
Noether also was responsible for a number of other advances in the field of algebra. With [[Emil Artin]], [[Richard Brauer]], and [[Helmut Hasse]], she founded the theory of [[central simple algebra]]s.{{Sfn |Lam | 1981 | pp= 152–53}}

A paper by Noether, Helmut Hasse, and [[Richard Brauer]] pertains to [[division algebra]]s,&lt;ref name = "hasse_1932"&gt;{{harvnb |Brauer|Hasse|Noether|1932}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a [[Hasse principle|local-global theorem]] stating that if a finite-dimensional central division algebra over a [[Algebraic number field|number field]] splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their ''Hauptsatz'' ("main theorem"):&lt;blockquote&gt;every finite dimensional [[central simple algebra|central]] [[division algebra]] over an [[algebraic number]] [[field (mathematics)|field]] F splits over a [[Abelian extension|cyclic cyclotomic extension]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra ''D'' are [[central simple algebra#Splitting field|splitting fields]].{{Sfn | Noether | 1933}} This paper also contains the [[Skolem–Noether theorem]] which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field ''k'' into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over ''k'', are conjugate. The [[Brauer–Noether theorem]]{{Sfn |Brauer | Noether | 1927}} gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.

Noether's work continues to be relevant for the development of theoretical physics and mathematics and she is consistently ranked as one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. In his obituary, fellow algebraist [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|BL van der Waerden]] says that her mathematical originality was "absolute beyond comparison",{{Sfn |Dick|1981|p=100}} and Hermann Weyl said that Noether "changed the face of [[abstract algebra|algebra]] by her work".&lt;ref name="weyl_128"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dick|1981|p= 128}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her lifetime and even until today, Noether has been characterized as the greatest woman mathematician in recorded history by mathematicians{{Sfn |Osen|1974|p= 152}}{{Sfn | Alexandrov | 1981 | p = 100}}{{Sfn |James|2002|p= 321}} such as [[Pavel Alexandrov]],{{Sfn | Dick | 1981 | p= 154}} [[Hermann Weyl]],{{Sfn | Dick| 1981| p= 152}} and [[Jean Dieudonné]].&lt;ref name = "g_noether_p167"&gt;{{Harvnb | Noether | 1987 | p = 167}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 January 1935, a few months before her death, mathematician [[Norbert Wiener]] wrote that {{Sfn | Kimberling | 1981|p= 35}}
{{quote |Miss Noether is ... the greatest woman mathematician who has ever lived; and the greatest woman scientist of any sort now living, and a scholar at least on the plane of [[Marie Curie|Madame Curie]].}}

The study of '''facility location problems''', also known as '''location analysis''', is a branch of [[operations research]] and [[computational geometry]] concerned with the optimal placement of facilities to minimize transportation costs while considering factors like avoiding placing hazardous materials near housing, and competitors' facilities. The techniques also apply to [[cluster analysis]].

==Minimum facility location==

A simple facility location problem is the [[Weber problem]], in which a single facility is to be placed, with the only optimization criterion being the minimization of the weighted sum of distances from a given set of point sites. More complex problems considered in this discipline include the placement of multiple facilities, constraints on the locations of facilities, and more complex optimization criteria.

In a basic formulation, the facility location problem consists of a set of potential facility sites ''L'' where a facility can be opened, and a set of demand points ''D'' that must be serviced. The goal is to pick a subset ''F'' of facilities to open, to minimize the sum of distances from each demand point to its nearest facility, plus the sum of opening costs of the facilities.

The facility location problem on general graphs is [[NP-hard]] to solve optimally, by reduction from (for example) the [[set cover problem]]. A number of approximation algorithms have been developed for the facility location problem and many of its variants.

Without assumptions on the set of distances between clients and sites (in particular, without assuming that the distances satisfy the [[triangle inequality]]), the problem is known as '''non-metric facility location''' and can be approximated to within a factor O(log&amp;nbsp;''n'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hochbaum | first1 = D. S. | authorlink = Dorit S.

==Minimax facility location==
The '''minimax facility location''' problem seeks a location which minimizes the maximum distance to the sites, where the distance from one point to the sites is the distance from the point to its nearest site. A formal definition is as follows:
Given a point set '''''P'''''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, find a point set '''''S'''''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, |'''''S'''''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'', so that max&lt;sub&gt;'''p'''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''''P'''''&lt;/sub&gt;(min&lt;sub&gt;'''q'''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''''S'''''&lt;/sub&gt;(d('''p''',&amp;nbsp;'''q''')) ) is minimized.

In the case of the Euclidean metric for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, it is known as the [[smallest enclosing sphere]] problem or [[1-center problem]]. Its study traced at least to the year of 1860. see [[smallest enclosing circle]] and [[bounding sphere]] for more details.

===NP hardness===
It has been proved that exact solution of ''k''-center problem is NP hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Approximation to the problem was found to be also NP hard when the error is small. The error level in the [[approximation algorithm]] is measured as an approximation factor, which is defined as the ratio between the approximation and the optimum.

'''1 + ''&amp;epsilon;'' approximation'''

1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''&amp;epsilon;'' approximation is to find a solution with approximation factor no greater than&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''&amp;epsilon;''. This approximation is NP hard as ''&amp;epsilon;'' is arbitrary. One approach based on the [[coreset]] concept is proposed with execution complexity of  &lt;math&gt;O(2^{O(k \log k/\varepsilon^2)}dn)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author claims that the running time is much less than the worst case and thus it's possible to solve some problems when ''k'' is small (say&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;5).

'''Farthest-point clustering'''

For the hardness of the problem, it's impractical to get an exact solution or precise approximation. Instead, an approximation with factor&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 is widely used for large ''k'' cases. The approximation is referred to as the farthest-point clustering (FPC) algorithm, or [[farthest-first traversal]].&lt;ref name=Gonzalez1985/&gt; The algorithm is quite simple: pick any point from the set as one center; search for the farthest point from remaining set as another center; repeat the process until ''k'' centers are found.

It is easy to see that this algorithm runs in linear time. As approximation with factor less than 2 is proved to be NP hard, FPC was regarded as the best approximation one can find.

As per the performance of execution, the time complexity is later improved to O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''k'') with box decomposition technique.&lt;ref name=Feder1988/&gt;

==Maxmin facility location==
The '''maxmin facility location''' or '''obnoxious facility location''' problem seeks a location which maximizes the minimum distance to the sites. In the case of the Euclidean metric, it is known as the [[largest empty sphere]] problem. The planar case ([[largest empty circle]] problem) may be solved in  [[time complexity|optimal time]] &amp;Theta;(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;n).&lt;ref name=ps256&gt;{{cite book

== Dynamic facility location problems ==

Dynamic facility location problems allow considering a time-dependent plan for the optimal placement of facilities to minimize transportation costs, while serving customers in some area or region. This class of problems emerges as appropriate when changes in demands or transportation costs are known. As an extension to their static counterparts, a general mathematical programming framework for dynamic facility location problems has been recently introduced by Laporte et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Integer programming formulations ==
Facility location problems are often solved as [[Integer programming|integer programs]]. In this context, facility location problems are often posed as follows: suppose there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; facilities and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; customers. We wish to choose (1) which of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; facilities to open, and (2) which (open) facilities to use to supply the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; customers, in order to satisfy some fixed demand at minimum cost. We introduce the following notation: let &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the (fixed) cost of opening facility &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;c_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;denote the cost to ship a product from facility &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to customer &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j=1,\dots,m&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt; denote the demand of customer &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;j=1,\dots,m&lt;/math&gt;. Further suppose that each facility has a maximum output. Let &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the maximum amount of product that can be produced by facility &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, that is, let &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the ''capacity'' of facility &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. The remainder of this section follows&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integer Programming {{!}} SpringerLink|volume = 271|last=Conforti|first=Michele|last2=Cornuéjols|first2=Gérard|last3=Zambelli|first3=Giacomo|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-11008-0|series = Graduate Texts in Mathematics|year = 2014|isbn = 978-3-319-11007-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capacitated facility location ===
In our initial formulation, introduce a binary variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x_i=1&lt;/math&gt; if facility &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is open, and &lt;math&gt;x_i=0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. Further introduce the variable &lt;math&gt;y_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j=1,\dots,m&lt;/math&gt; which represents the fraction of the demand &lt;math&gt;d_j&lt;/math&gt; filled by facility &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. The so-called '''capacitated facility location problem''' is then given by&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
\min &amp; \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^mc_{ij}y_{ij}+\sum_{i=1}^nf_ix_i \\
\text{s.t.} &amp; \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^ny_{ij}=1 \text{ for all }j=1,\dots,m \\
&amp; \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^md_jy_{ij}\leqslant u_ix_i\text{ for all }i=,1\dots,n \\
&amp;y_{ij}\geqslant0\text{ for all }i=1,\dots,n \text{ and }j=1,\dots,m\\
&amp;x_i\in\{0,1\}\text{ for all } i=1,\dots,n
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the second set of constraints ensure that if &lt;math&gt;x_i=0&lt;/math&gt;, that is, facility &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; isn't open, then &lt;math&gt;y_{ij}=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, that is, no demand for any customer can be filled from facility &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Uncapacitated facility location ===
A common case of the capacitated facility location problem above is the case when &lt;math&gt;u_i=+\infty&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, it is always optimal to satisfy all of the demand from customer &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; from the nearest open facility. Because of this, we may replace the continuous variables &lt;math&gt;y_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; from above with the binary variables &lt;math&gt;z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;z_{ij}=1&lt;/math&gt; if customer &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is supplied by facility &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z_{ij}=0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise. The '''uncapacitated facility location problem''' is then given by&lt;math display="block"&gt;\begin{array}{rl}
\min &amp; \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^mc_{ij}z_{ij}+\sum_{i=1}^nf_ix_i \\
\text{s.t.} &amp; \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^nz_{ij}=1 \text{ for all }j=1,\dots,m \\
&amp; \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^mz_{ij}\leqslant Mx_i\text{ for all }i=,1\dots,n \\
&amp;z_{ij}\in\{0,1\}\text{ for all }i=1,\dots,n \text{ and }j=1,\dots,m\\
&amp;x_i\in\{0,1\}\text{ for all } i=1,\dots,n
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a constant chosen to be suitably large. The choice of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; can affect computation results--the best choice in this instance is obvious: take &lt;math&gt;M=m&lt;/math&gt;. Then, if &lt;math&gt;x_i=1&lt;/math&gt;, any choice of the &lt;math&gt;z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; will satisfy the second set of constraints.

Another formulation possibility for the uncapacitated facility location problem is to ''disaggregate'' the capacity constraints (the big-&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; constraints). That is, replace the constraints&lt;math display="block"&gt;\sum_{j=1}^{m}z_{ij}\leqslant Mx_i\text{ for all }i=1,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;with the constraints&lt;math display="block"&gt;z_{ij}\leqslant x_i\text{ for all }i=1,\dots,n \text{ and }j=1,\dots,m&lt;/math&gt;In practice, this new formulation performs significantly better, in the sense that it has a tighter [[Linear programming]] relaxation than the first formulation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Notice that summing the new constraints together yields the original big-&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; constraints. In the capacitated case, these formulations are not equivalent. More information about the uncapacitated facility location problem can be found in Chapter 3 of "Discrete location theory".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19810449|title=Discrete location theory|date=1990|publisher=Wiley|others=Mirchandani, Pitu B., Francis, R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5166">The '''fold-and-cut theorem''' states that any shape with straight sides can be cut from a single (idealized) sheet of paper by folding it flat and making a single straight complete cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Erik D.|last1=Demaine|author1-link=Erik Demaine|first2=Martin L.|last2=Demaine|author2-link=Martin Demaine|contribution=Fold-and-Cut Magic|title=Tribute to a Mathemagician|year=2004|pages=23–30|publisher=A K Peters|url=http://erikdemaine.org/papers/FoldCut_G4G5/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such shapes include polygons, which may be concave, shapes with holes, and collections of such shapes (i.e. the regions need not be [[connected space|connected]]).

The corresponding problem that the theorem solves is known as the '''fold-and-cut problem''', which asks what shapes can be obtained by the so-called fold-and-cut method. A particular instance of the problem, which asks how a particular shape can be obtained by the fold-and-cut method, is known as ''a'' fold-and-cut problem.

== History ==
The earliest known description of a fold-and-cut problem appears in ''Wakoku Chiyekurabe'' (Mathematical Contests), a book that was published in 1721 by Kan Chu Sen in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://erikdemaine.org/foldcut/sen_book.html The Fold-and-Cut Problem: Kan Chu Sen's Wakoku Chiyekurabe], [[Erik Demaine]], 2010, retrieved 2013-10-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1873 article in ''Harper's New Monthly Magazine'' describes how Betsy Ross may have proposed that stars on the American flag have five points, because such a shape can easily be obtained by the fold-and-cut method.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=National standards and emblems|journal=Harper's|year=1873|volume=47|issue=278|pages=171–181|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/ndlpcoop/moahtml/title/lists/harp_V47I278.html|first=Kate Putnam|last=Osgood|quote=Mrs. Ross expressed her willingness to make the flag, but suggested that the stars would be more symmetrical and pleasing to the eye if made with five points, and she showed them how such a star could be made, by folding a sheet of paper and producing the pattern by a single cut.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, several magicians published books containing examples of fold-and-cut problems, including Will Blyth,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Paper magic : being a collection of entertaining and amusing models, toys, puzzles, conjuring tricks, etc., in which paper is the only or principle material required|first=Will|last=Blyth|location=London|publisher=C.

Inspired by Loe, [[Martin Gardner]] wrote about the fold-and-cut problems in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1960. Examples mentioned by Gardner include separating the red squares from the black squares of a [[checkerboard]] with one cut, and "an old paper-cutting stunt, of unknown origin" in which one cut splits a piece of paper into both a [[Latin cross]] and a set of smaller pieces that can be rearranged to spell the word "hell". Foreshadowing work on the general fold-and-cut theorem, he writes that "more complicated designs present formidable problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Martin|last=Gardner|title=Paper cutting|journal=[[Scientific American]]|date=June 1960}}. Reprinted with additional material as Chapter 5 of ''Martin Gardner's New Mathematical Diversions from Scientific American'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1966, pp. 58–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first proof of the fold-and-cut theorem, solving the problem, was published in 1999 by [[Erik Demaine]], [[Martin Demaine]], and [[Anna Lubiw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5675">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Hahn–Exton ''q''-Bessel function}}
In mathematics, the '''Hahn–Exton ''q''-Bessel function''' or the '''third [[Jackson q-Bessel function|Jackson ''q''-Bessel function]]''' is a [[q-analog|''q''-analog]] of the [[Bessel function]], and satisfies the Hahn-Exton ''q''-difference equation ({{harvs|txt|last=Swarttouw|year=1992}}). This function was introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Hahn|authorlink=Wolfgang Hahn|year=1953}} in a special case and by {{harvs|txt|last=Exton|authorlink=Harold Exton|year=1983}} in general.

The Hahn–Exton ''q''-Bessel function is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; J_\nu^{(3)}(x;q) = \frac{x^\nu(q^{\nu+1};q)_\infty}{(q;q)_\infty} \sum_{k\ge 0}\frac{(-1)^kq^{k(k+1)/2}x^{2k}}{(q^{\nu+1};q)_k(q;q)_k}= \frac{(q^{\nu+1};q)_\infty}{(q;q)_\infty} x^\nu {}_1\phi_1(0;q^{\nu+1};q,qx^2).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[basic hypergeometric function]].

==Properties==
===Zeros===
Koelink and Swarttouw proved that &lt;math&gt; J_\nu^{(3)}(x;q)&lt;/math&gt; has infinite number of real zeros.
They also proved that for &lt;math&gt;\nu&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; all non-zero roots of &lt;math&gt; J_\nu^{(3)}(x;q)&lt;/math&gt; are real ({{harvs|txt|last1=Koelink|last2=Swarttouw|year=1994}}). For more details, see {{harvtxt|Abreu|Bustoz|Cardoso|2003}} and {{harvtxt|Annaby|Mansour|2009}}. Zeros of the Hahn-Exton q-Bessel function appear in a discrete analog of [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s problem about free vibrations of a lump loaded chain ({{harvtxt|Hahn|1953}}, {{harvtxt|Exton|1983}})

===Derivatives===
For the (usual) derivative and q-derivative of &lt;math&gt; J_\nu^{(3)}(x;q)&lt;/math&gt;, see {{harvs|txt|last1=Koelink|last2=Swarttouw|year=1994}}. The symmetric q-derivative of &lt;math&gt; J_\nu^{(3)}(x;q)&lt;/math&gt; is described on {{harvs|txt|last1=Cardoso|year=2016}}.

===Recurrence Relation===
The Hahn–Exton q-Bessel function has the following recurrence relation (see {{harvs|txt|last=Swarttouw|year=1992}}):
:&lt;math&gt; J_{\nu+1}^{(3)}(x;q)=\left(\frac{1-q^\nu}{x}+x\right)J_\nu^{(3)}(x;q)-J_{\nu-1}^{(3)}(x;q).&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative Representations==
===Integral Representation===
The Hahn–Exton q-Bessel function has the following integral representation (see {{harvs|txt|authorlink1=Mourad E. H. Ismail|R. Zhang|last1=Ismail|last2=Zhang|year=2016}}):
:&lt;math&gt;
J_{\nu}^{(3)}(z;q)=\frac{z^\nu}{\sqrt{\pi\log q^{-2}}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\exp\left(\frac{x^2}{\log q^2}\right)}{(q,-q^{\nu+1/2}e^{\mathrm{i}x},-q^{1/2}z^2e^{\mathrm{i}x};q)_{\infty}}\mathrm{d}x.
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n;q)_{\infty}:=(a_1;q)_{\infty}(a_2;q)_{\infty}\cdots(a_n;q)_{\infty}.&lt;/math&gt;
For a contour integral representation, see {{harvtxt|Prellberg|1995}}.

===Hypergeometric Representation===
The Hahn–Exton q-Bessel function has the following hypergeometric representation (see {{harvs|txt|last=Daalhuis|year=1994}}):
:&lt;math&gt;
J_{\nu}^{(3)}(x;q)=x^{\nu}\frac{(x^2 q;q)_{\infty}}{(q;q)_{\infty}}\ _1\phi_1(0;x^2 q;q,q^{\nu+1}).
&lt;/math&gt;
This converges fast at &lt;math&gt;x\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. It is also an asymptotic expansion for &lt;math&gt;\nu\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1193">In [[mathematics]], '''Hölder summation''' is a method for summing [[divergent series]] introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Hölder|year=1882|authorlink=Otto Hölder}}.

==Definition==

Given a [[series (mathematics)|series]]
:&lt;math&gt; a_1+a_2+\cdots, &lt;/math&gt;
define
:&lt;math&gt;H^0_n=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^{k+1}_n=\frac{H^k_1+\cdots+H^k_n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
If the limit
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}H^k_n &lt;/math&gt;
exists for some ''k'', this is called the Hölder sum, or the (''H'',''k'') sum, of the series.

Particularly, since the [[Cesàro sum]] of a convergent series always exists, the Hölder sum of a series (that is Hölder summable) can be written in the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\begin{smallmatrix}
n\rightarrow\infty\\ k\rightarrow\infty
\end{smallmatrix}}H^k_n &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5620">'''Israel Kleiner''' is a Canadian mathematician and historian of mathematics.

Kleiner earned an MA at Yale University (1963) and a PhD at [[McGill University]] (1967) under [[Joachim Lambek]] with a thesis ''Lie modules and rings of quotients''.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=15642|name=Israel Kleiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his retirement as professor emeritus, he spent his career as a mathematics professor at [[York University]], where he was a member of the faculty since 1965 and where he coordinated the training program for mathematics teachers teaching at the secondary school level. He is noted for his work on the history of algebra and on the combination of the history of mathematics and mathematics education.

He received the [[Carl B. Allendoerfer Award]] in 1987 and again in 1992, the [[George Pólya Award]] in 1990, and the [[Lester Randolph Ford Award]] in 1995. He was in the mid 2000s vice-president of the Canadian Society for the History and Philosophy of Mathematics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16471">'''Iterated filtering''' algorithms are a tool for [[maximum likelihood]] inference on partially observed [[dynamical system]]s.  [[Stochastic]] [[perturbation theory|perturbations]] to the unknown parameters are used to explore the parameter space.  Applying sequential Monte Carlo (the [[particle filter]]) to this extended model results in the selection of the parameter values that are more consistent with the data.  Appropriately constructed procedures, iterating with successively diminished perturbations, converge to the maximum likelihood estimate.&lt;ref name=ionides06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ionides11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ionides15 /&gt;  Iterated filtering methods have so far been used most extensively to study infectious disease transmission dynamics.  Case studies include [[cholera]],&lt;ref name=king08 /&gt;&lt;ref name=breto09 /&gt; [[Ebola virus]],&lt;ref name=king15prsb /&gt; [[influenza]],&lt;ref name=he11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=camacho11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=earn12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shrestha13 /&gt; [[malaria]],&lt;ref name=laneri10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bhadra11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=roy13 /&gt; [[HIV]],&lt;ref name=zhou13 /&gt; [[pertussis]],&lt;ref name=lavine12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=blackwood13 /&gt; [[poliovirus]]&lt;ref name=blake14 /&gt;  and [[measles]].&lt;ref name=breto09 /&gt;&lt;ref name=he10 /&gt;  Other areas which have been proposed to be suitable for these methods include ecological dynamics&lt;ref name=ionides11-statSci&gt;{{cite journal|last = Ionides|first = E. L..|title = Discussion on "Feature Matching in Time Series Modeling" by Y. Xia and H.

The perturbations to the [[parameter]] space play several different roles. Firstly, they smooth out the likelihood surface, enabling the algorithm to overcome small-scale features of the likelihood during early stages of the global search. Secondly, Monte Carlo variation allows the search to escape from local minima. Thirdly, the iterated filtering update uses the perturbed parameter values to construct an approximation to the derivative of the log likelihood even though this quantity is not typically available in closed form. Fourthly, the parameter perturbations help to overcome numerical difficulties that can arise during sequential Monte Carlo.

==Overview==
The data are a time series &lt;math&gt;y_1,\dots,y_N&lt;/math&gt; collected at times &lt;math&gt; t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \dots &lt; t_N&lt;/math&gt;. The dynamic system is modeled by a [[Markov process]] &lt;math&gt; X(t)&lt;/math&gt; which is generated by a function &lt;math&gt;f(x,s,t,\theta,W)&lt;/math&gt; in the sense that

: &lt;math&gt;X(t^{}_n)=f(X(t^{}_{n-1}),t^{}_{n-1},t^{}_n,\theta,W) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of unknown parameters and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is some random quantity that is drawn independently each time &lt;math&gt;f(.)&lt;/math&gt; is evaluated.  An initial condition &lt;math&gt;X(t_0)&lt;/math&gt; at some time &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is specified by an initialization function, &lt;math&gt;X(t_0)=h(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;. A measurement density &lt;math&gt; g(y_n|X_n,t_n,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; completes the specification of a partially observed Markov process. We present a basic iterated filtering algorithm (IF1)&lt;ref name=ionides06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ionides11 /&gt; followed by an iterated filtering algorithm implementing an iterated, perturbed Bayes map (IF2).&lt;ref name=ionides15 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lindstrom12 /&gt;

==Procedure: Iterated filtering (IF1)==
:Input: A partially observed Markov model specified as above; Monte Carlo sample size &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;; number of iterations &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;; cooling parameters &lt;math&gt;0&lt;a&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;; covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;; initial parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\theta^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;

:for &lt;math&gt;m^{}_{}=1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;
::draw &lt;math&gt;\Theta_F(t^{}_0,j)\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\theta^{(m)},b a^{m-1} \Phi)&lt;/math&gt;  for  &lt;math&gt;j=1,\dots, J&lt;/math&gt;
::set &lt;math&gt;X_F(t^{}_0,j)=h\big(\Theta_F(t^{}_0,j)\big)&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;j=1,\dots, J&lt;/math&gt;
::set &lt;math&gt;\bar\theta(t^{}_0)=\theta^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;
::for &lt;math&gt;n^{}_{}=1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;N^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;
:::draw &lt;math&gt;\Theta_P(t^{}_n,j)\sim \mathrm{Normal}(\Theta_F(t^{}_{n-1},j), a^{m-1} \Phi)&lt;/math&gt;  for  &lt;math&gt;j=1,\dots, J&lt;/math&gt;
:::set &lt;math&gt;X_P(t^{}_n,j)=f(X_F(t^{}_{n-1},j),t^{}_{n-1},t_n,\Theta_P(t_{n},j),W)&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;j=1,\dots, J&lt;/math&gt;
:::set &lt;math&gt;w(n,j) = g(y_n|X_P(t^{}_n,j),t^{}_n,\Theta_P(t_{n},j))&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;j=1,\dots, J&lt;/math&gt;
:::draw &lt;math&gt;k^{}_1,\dots,k^{}_J&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;P(k^{}_j=i)=w(n,i)\big/{\sum}_\ell w(n,\ell)&lt;/math&gt;
:::set &lt;math&gt;X_F(t^{}_n,j)=X_P(t^{}_n,k^{}_j)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta_F(t^{}_n,j)=\Theta_P(t^{}_n,k^{}_j)&lt;/math&gt; for  &lt;math&gt;j=1,\dots, J&lt;/math&gt;
:::set &lt;math&gt;\bar\theta_i^{}(t_n^{})&lt;/math&gt; to the sample mean of &lt;math&gt;\{\Theta_{F,i}^{}(t^{}_{n},j),j=1,\dots,J\}&lt;/math&gt;, where the vector &lt;math&gt;\Theta^{}_F&lt;/math&gt; has components &lt;math&gt;\{\Theta^{}_{F,i}\}&lt;/math&gt;
:::set &lt;math&gt;V_i^{}(t_n^{})&lt;/math&gt; to the sample variance of &lt;math&gt;\{\Theta_{P,i}^{}(t^{}_{n},j),j=1,\dots,J\}&lt;/math&gt;
::set &lt;math&gt;\theta_i^{(m+1)}= \theta_i^{(m)}+V_i(t_{1})\sum_{n=1}^N V_i^{-1}(t_{n})(\bar\theta_i(t_n)-\bar\theta_i(t_{n-1}))&lt;/math&gt;

:Output: Maximum likelihood estimate &lt;math&gt;\hat\theta=\theta^{(M+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Variations==
# For IF1, parameters which enter the model only in the specification of the initial condition, &lt;math&gt;X(t_0)&lt;/math&gt;, warrant some special algorithmic attention since information about them in the data may be concentrated in a small part of the time series.&lt;ref name=ionides06 /&gt;
# Theoretically, any distribution with the requisite mean and variance could be used in place of the [[normal distribution]]. It is standard to use the normal distribution and to reparameterise to remove constraints on the possible values of the parameters.
# Modifications to the IF1 algorithm have been proposed to give superior asymptotic performance.&lt;ref name=lindstrom13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=doucet13 /&gt;

[[File:Petersen Julius.jpg|thumb|Julius Petersen.]]  
'''Julius Peter Christian Petersen''' (16 June 1839, [[Sorø]], [[West Zealand]] &amp;ndash; 5 August 1910, [[Copenhagen]]) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[mathematician]]. His contributions to the field of mathematics led to the birth of [[graph theory]].

==Biography==
Petersen's interests in mathematics were manifold, including: [[geometry]], [[complex analysis]], [[number theory]], [[mathematical physics]], [[mathematical economics]], [[cryptography]] and [[graph theory]].
His famous paper ''Die Theorie der regulären graphs''&lt;ref name="pet"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Petersen, J.|title=Die Theorie der regulären graphs|journal=[[Acta Mathematica]]|volume=15|year=1891|issue=1 | pages = 193–220 | doi = 10.1007/BF02392606}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a fundamental contribution to modern graph theory as we know it today. In 1898, he presented a counterexample to [[Peter Guthrie Tait|Tait]]'s claimed theorem about [[1-factorability]] of 3-regular graphs, which is nowadays known as the "[[Petersen graph]]". In cryptography and mathematical economics he made contributions which today are seen as pioneering.

He published a systematic treatment of [[geometry|geometrical]] constructions (with [[straightedge and compass]]) in 1880. A [[French language|French]] translation was reprinted in 1990.

A special issue of [[Discrete Mathematics (journal)|Discrete Mathematics]] has been dedicated to the 150th birthday of Petersen.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lützen, J.; [[Gert Sabidussi|Sabidussi, G.]] and Toft, B.|title=Julius Petersen 1839–1910 a biography|volume=100|issue=1–3|year=1992|pages=9–82|doi=10.1016/0012-365X(92)90636-T | journal = [[Discrete Mathematics (journal)|Discrete Mathematics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petersen, as he claimed, had a very independent way of thinking. In order to preserve this independence he made a habit to read as little as possible of other people’s mathematics, pushing it to extremes. The consequences for his lack of knowledge of the literature of the time were severe. He spent a significant part of his time rediscovering already known results, in other cases already existing results had to be removed from a submitted paper and in other more serious cases a paper did not get published at all.

He started from very modest beginnings, and by hard work, some luck and some good connections, moved steadily upward to a station of considerable importance. In 1891 his work received royal recognition through the award of the Order of the Dannebrog. Among mathematicians he enjoyed an international reputation. At his death –which was front page news in Copenhagen– the socialist newspaper Social-Demokraten correctly sensed the popular appeal of his story: here was a kind of Hans Christian Andersen of science, a child of the people who had made good in the intellectual world.

==Early life and education==
Peter Christian Julius Petersen was born on the 16th of June 1839 in [[Sorø]] on Zealand. His parents were Jens Petersen (1803–1873), a dyer by profession, and Anna Cathrine Petersen (1813–1896), born Wiuff. He had two younger brothers, Hans Christian Rudolf Petersen (1844–1868) and Carl Sophus Valdemar Petersen (1846–1935), and two sisters, Nielsine Cathrine Marie Petersen (1837–?) and Sophie Caroline Petersen (1842–?). After preparation in a private school, he was admitted in 1849 into second grade at the [[Sorø Academy]], a prestigious boarding school. He was taken out of school after his confirmation in 1854, because his parents could not afford to keep him there, and he worked as an apprentice for almost a year in an uncle’s grocery in Kolding, Jutland. The uncle died, however, and left Petersen a sum of money that enabled him to return to Sorø, pass the real-examination in 1856 with distinction, and begin his studies at the [[Technical University of Denmark#History|Polytechnical College]] in Copenhagen. In 1860 Petersen passed the first part of the civil engineering examination. By that same year he had decided to study mathematics at the university, rather than to continue with the more practical second part of the engineering education. However, his inheritance was used up and he now had to teach to make a living. From 1859 to 1871 he taught at one of Copenhagen's most prestigious private high-schools, the [[w:da:Det von Westenske Institut|von Westenske Institut]], with occasional part-time teaching jobs at other private schools. In 1862 he passed the student-examination, and could now enter the university. In 1866 Julius Petersen obtained the degree of magister in mathematics at the University, and by 1871 he obtained the Dr. Phil. Degree at Copenhagen University. In his ''doctorvita'' written for the university, Petersen wrote: ''"Mathematics had, from the time I started to learn it, taken my complete interest, and most of my work consisted in solving problems of my own and my friends, and in seeking the trisection of the angle, a problem that has had a great influence on my whole development".''

In the summer of 1871 he married Laura Kirstine Bertelsen (1837–1901) and seven months later the couple had their first son Aage Wiuff-Petersen (1863–1927). Later the family increased with another son, Thor Ejnar Petersen (1867–1946), and a daughter, Agnete Helga Kathrine Petersen (1872–1941).

==Work==
Many of Petersen’s early contributions to mathematics were mainly focused on geometry. During the 1860s he wrote five textbooks along with some papers, all on geometry. One of his most remarkable works was a book, ''‘Methods and Theories’''. The first edition of this book appeared only in Danish, but the 1879 edition was translated into eight different languages including English, French, and Spanish, earning him an international reputation more than any of his other works.

In graph theory, two of Petersen’s most famous contributions are: the Petersen graph, exhibited in 1898, served as a counterexample to Tait’s ‘theorem’ on the 4-colour problem: a bridgeless 3-regular graph is factorable into three 1-factors and the theorem: ''‘a connected 3-regular graph with at most two leaves contains a 1-factor’''.

In 1891 Petersen published a paper in the Acta Mathematica (volume 15, pages 193–220) entitled ''‘Die Theorie der regularen graphs’''. It was the first paper containing (correct) results explicitly in graph theory. The paper consisted of four major parts:

(i) The transformation of the original algebraic problem into a graph theoretical one

(ii) The problem of factorizing regular graphs of even degree. Here Petersen proves his first major result, viz. that any such graph has a 2-factorization ([[2-factor theorem]]).

(iii) Criteria for the existence of edge-separating factorizations of 4-regular graphs.

(iv) The factorization of regular graphs of odd degree, in particular, the theorem that any bridgeless 3-regular graph can be decomposed into a l-factor and a 2-factor ([[Petersen's theorem]]).

Between 1887 and 1895 Petersen also contributed to mathematics with different models and instruments. one of these models was a ‘eine Serie von kinematischen Modellen’ which in 1888 was asked by ‘Verlagsbuchhandler L. Brill’ for permission to produce and sell. In 1887 Petersen had constructed another model; a planimeter which was presented to the Royal Danish Academy of Science and Letters. It consisted of an arm, of, whose one end o is fixed to the paper by a lead cylinder with a pin p, and whose other end f is connected to a second arm dc (or df) of length L. When the stylus d is moved around the domain once, the area is measured as L∫dh, where dh is the differential displacement of the arm dc orthogonal to itself.

==Last years==
In the spring of 1908 Petersen suffered a stroke. But even in this condition his optimism and desire to work did not stop him. In a letter to [[Gösta Mittag-Leffler|Mittag-Leffler]] in Stockholm he wrote: 
''“I feel in all respects rather well, it is only that I cannot walk and have difficulties in talking. However I hope to get so far this summer that I can resume my lectures in the autumn”.''  
His last two years became a period of physical and mental debility, where, towards the end, he hardly had any memory left of his wide interests and the rich work which had filled his life. In 1909 he retired from his professorship. He died on August 5, 1910, after having been hospitalized for five months. He was buried at [[Vestre Cemetery|Vestre Kirkegaard]], where Copenhagen University cared for his grave until 1947.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Milliken–Taylor theorem''' in [[combinatorics]] is a generalization of both [[Ramsey's theorem]] and [[IP set|Hindman's theorem]]. It is named after Keith Milliken and [[Alan D. Taylor]].

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_f(\mathbb{N})&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, and define a partial order on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_f(\mathbb{N})&lt;/math&gt; by &amp;alpha;&lt;&amp;beta; [[if and only if]] max &amp;alpha;&lt;min &amp;beta;. Given a sequence of integers &lt;math&gt;\langle a_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty \subset \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; and {{nowrap|''k'' &gt; 0}}, let 
:&lt;math&gt;[FS(\langle a_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty)]^k_&lt; = \left \{ \left \{ \sum_{t\in \alpha_1}a_t, \ldots , \sum_{t\in \alpha_k}a_t \right \}: \alpha_1 ,\cdots , \alpha_k \in \mathcal{P}_f(\mathbb{N})\text{ and }\alpha_1 &lt;\cdots &lt; \alpha_k \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;[S]^k&lt;/math&gt; denote the ''k''-element subsets of a set ''S''. The Milliken–Taylor theorem says that for any finite partition &lt;math&gt;[\mathbb{N}]^k=C_1 \cup C_2 \cup \cdots \cup C_r&lt;/math&gt;, there exist some {{nowrap|''i'' &amp;le; ''r''}} and a sequence &lt;math&gt;\langle a_n \rangle_{n=0}^{\infty} \subset \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;[FS(\langle a_n \rangle_{n=0}^{\infty})]^k_&lt; \subset C_i&lt;/math&gt;.

For each &lt;math&gt;\langle a_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty \subset \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, call &lt;math&gt;[FS(\langle a_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty)]^k_&lt; &lt;/math&gt; an ''MT&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; set''. Then, alternatively, the Milliken–Taylor theorem asserts that the collection of MT&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; sets is [[partition regular]] for each ''k''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55148">In [[logic]] and [[proof theory]], '''natural deduction''' is a kind of [[proof calculus]] in which [[logical reasoning]] is expressed by [[inference rules]] closely related to the "natural" way of reasoning. This contrasts with [[Hilbert-style system]]s, which instead use [[axiom]]s as much as possible to express the logical laws of [[deductive reasoning]].

== Motivation ==
Natural deduction grew out of a context of dissatisfaction with the axiomatizations of deductive reasoning common to the systems of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] (see, e.g., [[Hilbert system]]). Such axiomatizations were most famously used by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] in their mathematical treatise ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Spurred on by a series of seminars in Poland in 1926 by [[Jan Lukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]] that advocated a more natural treatment of logic, [[Stanisław Jaśkowski|Jaśkowski]] made the earliest attempts at defining a more natural deduction, first in 1929 using a diagrammatic notation, and later updating his proposal in a sequence of papers in 1934 and 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaśkowski|1934}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His proposals led to different notations
such as [[Fitch-style calculus]] (or Fitch's diagrams) or [[Patrick Suppes|Suppes]]' method of which e.g. [[John Lemmon|Lemmon]] gave a variant called [[system L]].

Natural deduction in its modern form was independently proposed by the German mathematician [[Gerhard Gentzen]] in 1934, in a dissertation delivered to the faculty of mathematical sciences of the University of Göttingen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentzen|1934}}, {{harvnb|Gentzen|1935}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''natural deduction'' (or rather, its German equivalent ''natürliches Schließen'') was coined in that paper:

{{quote|Ich wollte nun zunächst einmal einen Formalismus aufstellen, der dem wirklichen Schließen möglichst nahe kommt. So ergab sich ein "Kalkül des natürlichen Schließens".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gentzen|1934|p=176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(First I wished to construct a formalism that comes as close as possible to actual reasoning. Thus arose a "calculus of natural deduction".)}}

Gentzen was motivated by a desire to establish the consistency of [[number theory]]. He was unable to prove the main result required for the consistency result, the [[cut elimination theorem]]—the Hauptsatz—directly for natural deduction. For this reason he introduced his alternative system, the [[sequent calculus]], for which he proved the Hauptsatz both for [[Classical logic|classical]] and [[intuitionistic logic]]. In a series of seminars in 1961 and 1962 [[Dag Prawitz|Prawitz]] gave a comprehensive summary of natural deduction calculi, and transported much of Gentzen's work with sequent calculi into the natural deduction framework. His 1965 monograph ''Natural deduction: a proof-theoretical study''&lt;ref name=prawitz1965&gt;{{harvnb|Prawitz|1965}}, {{harvnb|Prawitz|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was to become a reference work on natural deduction, and included applications for [[modal logic|modal]] and [[second-order logic]].

In natural deduction, a [[proposition]] is deduced from a collection of premises by applying inference rules repeatedly. The system presented in this article is a minor variation of Gentzen's or Prawitz's formulation, but with a closer adherence to [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]]'s description of logical judgments and connectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin-Löf|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgments and propositions==
A ''[[Judgment (mathematical logic)|judgment]]'' is something that is knowable, that is, an object of knowledge. It is ''evident'' if one in fact knows it.&lt;ref&gt;This is due to Bolzano, as cited by {{harvnb|Martin-Löf|1996|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "''it is raining''" is a judgment, which is evident for the one who knows that it is actually raining; in this case one may readily find evidence for the judgment by looking outside the window or stepping out of the house. In mathematical logic however, evidence is often not as directly observable, but rather deduced from more basic evident judgments. The process of deduction is what constitutes a ''proof''; in other words, a judgment is evident if one has a proof for it.

The most important judgments in logic are of the form "''A is true''". The letter ''A'' stands for any expression representing a ''proposition''; the truth judgments thus require a more primitive judgment: "''A is a proposition''". Many other judgments have been studied; for example, "''A is false''" (see [[classical logic]]), "''A is true at time t''" (see [[temporal logic]]), "''A is necessarily true''" or "''A is possibly true''" (see [[modal logic]]), "''the program M has type τ''" (see [[programming language]]s and [[type theory]]), "''A is achievable from the available resources''" (see [[linear logic]]), and many others. To start with, we shall concern ourselves with the simplest two judgments "''A is a proposition''" and "''A is true''", abbreviated as "''A'' prop" and "''A'' true" respectively.

The judgment "''A'' prop" defines the structure of valid proofs of ''A'', which in turn defines the structure of propositions. For this reason, the [[inference rule]]s for this judgment are sometimes known as ''formation rules''. To illustrate, if we have two propositions ''A'' and ''B'' (that is, the judgments "''A'' prop" and "''B'' prop" are evident), then we form the compound proposition ''A and B'', written symbolically as "&lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;". We can write this in the form of an inference rule:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{A\hbox{ prop} \qquad B\hbox{ prop}}{(A \wedge B)\hbox{ prop}}\ \wedge_F&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
where the parentheses are omitted to make the inference rule more succinct:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{A\hbox{ prop} \qquad B\hbox{ prop}}{A \wedge B\hbox{ prop}}\ \wedge_F&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
This inference rule is ''schematic'': ''A'' and ''B'' can be instantiated with any expression. The general form of an inference rule is:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{J_1 \qquad J_2 \qquad \cdots \qquad J_n}{J}\ \hbox{name}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
where each &lt;math&gt;J_i&lt;/math&gt; is a judgment and the inference rule is named "name". The judgments above the line are known as ''premises'', and those below the line are ''conclusions''. Other common logical propositions are disjunction (&lt;math&gt;A \vee B&lt;/math&gt;), negation (&lt;math&gt;\neg A&lt;/math&gt;), implication (&lt;math&gt;A \supset B&lt;/math&gt;), and the logical constants truth (&lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;) and falsehood (&lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;). Their formation rules are below.
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{A\hbox{ prop} \qquad B\hbox{ prop}}{A \vee B\hbox{ prop}}\ \vee_F
\qquad
\frac{A\hbox{ prop} \qquad B\hbox{ prop}}{A \supset B\hbox{ prop}}\ \supset_F
\qquad
\frac{\hbox{ }}{\top\hbox{ prop}}\ \top_F
\qquad
\frac{\hbox{ }}{\bot\hbox{ prop}}\ \bot_F
\qquad
\frac{A\hbox{ prop}}{\neg A\hbox{ prop}}\ \neg_F
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

==Introduction and elimination==
Now we discuss the "''A'' true" judgment. Inference rules that introduce a logical connective in the conclusion are known as ''introduction rules''. To introduce conjunctions, ''i.e.'', to conclude "''A and B'' true" for propositions ''A'' and ''B'', one requires evidence for "''A'' true" and "''B'' true". As an inference rule:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{A\hbox{ true} \qquad B\hbox{ true}}{(A \wedge B)\hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_I
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
It must be understood that in such rules the objects are propositions. That is, the above rule is really an abbreviation for:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{A\hbox{ prop} \qquad B\hbox{ prop} \qquad A\hbox{ true} \qquad B\hbox{ true}}{(A \wedge B) \hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_I
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
This can also be written:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{A \wedge B\hbox{ prop} \qquad A\hbox{ true} \qquad B\hbox{ true}}{(A \wedge B)\hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_I
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
In this form, the first premise can be satisfied by the &lt;math&gt;\wedge_F&lt;/math&gt; formation rule, giving the first two premises of the previous form. In this article we shall elide the "prop" judgments where they are understood. In the nullary case, one can derive truth from no premises.
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\ }{\top\hbox{ true}}\ \top_I
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
If the truth of a proposition can be established in more than one way, the corresponding connective has multiple introduction rules.
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{A\hbox{ true}}{A \vee B\hbox{ true}}\ \vee_{I1}
\qquad
\frac{B\hbox{ true}}{A \vee B\hbox{ true}}\ \vee_{I2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Note that in the nullary case, ''i.e.'', for falsehood, there are ''no'' introduction rules. Thus one can never infer falsehood from simpler judgments.

Dual to introduction rules are ''elimination rules'' to describe how to deconstruct information about a compound proposition into information about its constituents. Thus, from "''A ∧ B'' true", we can conclude "''A'' true" and "''B'' true":
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{A \wedge B\hbox{ true}}{A\hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_{E1}
\qquad
\frac{A \wedge B\hbox{ true}}{B\hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_{E2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
As an example of the use of inference rules, consider commutativity of conjunction. If ''A'' ∧ ''B'' is true, then ''B'' ∧ ''A'' is true; This derivation can be drawn by composing inference rules in such a fashion that premises of a lower inference match the conclusion of the next higher inference.

&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;!-- there are serious vertical spacing issues here, but since Wikipedia's texvc parser doesn't support \displaystyle, our hands are tied somewhat --&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
 \cfrac{\cfrac{A \wedge B\hbox{ true}}{B\hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_{E2} 
 \qquad
 \cfrac{A \wedge B\hbox{ true}}{A\hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_{E1}}
 {B \wedge A\hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_I
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The inference figures we have seen so far are not sufficient to state the rules of implication introduction or disjunction elimination; for these, we need a more general notion of ''hypothetical derivation''.

==Hypothetical derivations==
A pervasive operation in mathematical logic is ''reasoning from assumptions''. For example, consider the following derivation:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\cfrac{A \wedge \left ( B \wedge C \right ) \hbox{ true}}{\cfrac{B \wedge C \hbox{ true}}{B \hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_{E1}}\ \wedge_{E2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
This derivation does not establish the truth of ''B'' as such; rather, it establishes the following fact:
:If ''A ∧ (B ∧ C) is true'' then ''B is true''.
In logic, one says "''assuming A ∧ (B ∧ C) is true, we show that B is true''"; in other words, the judgment "''B'' true" depends on the assumed judgment "''A ∧ (B ∧ C)'' true". This is a ''hypothetical derivation'', which we write as follows:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
A \wedge \left ( B \wedge C \right ) \hbox{ true} \\
\vdots \\
B \hbox{ true}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The interpretation is: "''B true'' is derivable from ''A ∧ (B ∧ C) true''". Of course, in this specific example we actually know the derivation of "''B'' true" from "''A ∧ (B ∧ C)'' true", but in general we may not ''a priori'' know the derivation. The general form of a hypothetical derivation is:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
D_1 \quad D_2 \ \cdots \ D_n \\
\vdots \\
J
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Each hypothetical derivation has a collection of ''antecedent'' derivations (the ''D&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') written on the top line, and a ''succedent'' judgment (''J'') written on the bottom line. Each of the premises may itself be a hypothetical derivation. (For simplicity, we treat a judgment as a premise-less derivation.)

The notion of hypothetical judgment is ''internalised'' as the connective of implication. The introduction and elimination rules are as follows.
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\cfrac{
 \begin{matrix}
 \cfrac{}{A \hbox{ true}}\ u \\
 \vdots \\
 B \hbox{ true}
 \end{matrix}
}{A \supset B \hbox{ true}}\ \supset_{I^u}
\qquad \cfrac{A \supset B \hbox{ true} \quad A \hbox{ true}}{B \hbox{ true}}\ \supset_E
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In the introduction rule, the antecedent named ''u'' is ''discharged'' in the conclusion. This is a mechanism for delimiting the ''scope'' of the hypothesis: its sole reason for existence is to establish "''B'' true"; it cannot be used for any other purpose, and in particular, it cannot be used below the introduction. As an example, consider the derivation of "''A ⊃ (B ⊃ (A ∧ B))'' true":
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
 \cfrac{\cfrac{\cfrac{}{A \hbox{ true}}\ u \quad \cfrac{}{B \hbox{ true}}\ w}{A \wedge B \hbox{ true}}\ \wedge_I}{
 \cfrac{B \supset \left ( A \wedge B \right ) \hbox{ true}}{
 A \supset \left ( B \supset \left ( A \wedge B \right ) \right ) \hbox{ true}
 }\ \supset_{I^u}
 }\ \supset_{I^w}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
This full derivation has no unsatisfied premises; however, sub-derivations ''are'' hypothetical. For instance, the derivation of "''B ⊃ (A ∧ B)'' true" is hypothetical with antecedent "''A'' true" (named ''u'').

With hypothetical derivations, we can now write the elimination rule for disjunction:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\cfrac{
 A \vee B \hbox{ true}
 \quad
 \begin{matrix}
 \cfrac{}{A \hbox{ true}}\ u \\
 \vdots \\
 C \hbox{ true}
 \end{matrix}
 \quad
 \begin{matrix}
 \cfrac{}{B \hbox{ true}}\ w \\
 \vdots \\
 C \hbox{ true}
 \end{matrix}
}{C \hbox{ true}}\ \vee_{E^{u,w}}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
In words, if ''A ∨ B'' is true, and we can derive "''C'' true" both from "''A'' true" and from "''B'' true", then ''C'' is indeed true. Note that this rule does not commit to either "''A'' true" or "''B'' true". In the zero-ary case, ''i.e.'' for falsehood, we obtain the following elimination rule:
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\perp \hbox{ true}}{C \hbox{ true}}\ \perp_E
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
This is read as: if falsehood is true, then any proposition ''C'' is true.

Negation is similar to implication.
&lt;div style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\cfrac{
 \begin{matrix}
 \cfrac{}{A \hbox{ true}}\ u \\
 \vdots \\
 p \hbox{ true}
 \end{matrix}
}{\lnot A \hbox{ true}}\ \lnot_{I^{u,p}}
\qquad
\cfrac{\lnot A \hbox{ true} \quad A \hbox{ true}}{C \hbox{ true}}\ \lnot_E
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
The introduction rule discharges both the name of the hypothesis ''u'', and the succedent ''p'', ''i.e.'', the proposition ''p'' must not occur in the conclusion ''A''. Since these rules are schematic, the interpretation of the introduction rule is: if from "''A'' true" we can derive for every proposition ''p'' that "''p'' true", then ''A'' must be false, ''i.e.'', "''not A'' true". For the elimination, if both ''A'' and ''not A'' are shown to be true, then there is a contradiction, in which case every proposition ''C'' is true. Because the rules for implication and negation are so similar, it should be fairly easy to see that ''not A'' and ''A ⊃ ⊥'' are equivalent, i.e., each is derivable from the other.

==Consistency, completeness, and normal forms==
A [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] is said to be consistent if falsehood is not provable (from no assumptions) and is complete if every theorem or its negation is provable using the inference rules of the logic. These are statements about the entire logic, and are usually tied to some notion of a [[model theory|model]]. However, there are local notions of consistency and completeness that are purely syntactic checks on the inference rules, and require no appeals to models. The first of these is local consistency, also known as local reducibility, which says that any derivation containing an introduction of a connective followed immediately by its elimination can be turned into an equivalent derivation without this detour. It is a check on the ''strength'' of elimination rules: they must not be so strong that they include knowledge not already contained in their premises. As an example, consider conjunctions.
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 ────── u   ────── w
 A true        B true
 ────────────────── ∧I
     A ∧ B true
     ────────── ∧E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
       A true
| width="30" align="center" | ⇒ || 
 ────── u
 A true
|}

Dually, local completeness says that the elimination rules are strong enough to decompose a connective into the forms suitable for its introduction rule. Again for conjunctions:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 ────────── u
 A ∧ B true
| width="30" align="center" | ⇒ || 
 ────────── u    ────────── u
 A ∧ B true          A ∧ B true
 ────────── ∧E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;   ────────── ∧E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
   A true                  B true
   ─────────────────────── ∧I
        A ∧ B true
|}

These notions correspond exactly to [[Lambda calculus#.CE.B2-reduction|β-reduction (beta reduction)]] and [[Lambda calculus#.CE.B7-conversion|η-conversion (eta conversion)]] in the [[lambda calculus]], using the [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism]]. By local completeness, we see that every derivation can be converted to an equivalent derivation where the principal connective is introduced. In fact, if the entire derivation obeys this ordering of eliminations followed by introductions, then it is said to be ''normal''. In a normal derivation all eliminations happen above introductions. In most logics, every derivation has an equivalent normal derivation, called a ''normal form''. The existence of normal forms is generally hard to prove using natural deduction alone, though such accounts do exist in the literature, most notably by [[Dag Prawitz]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;See also his book {{harvnb|Prawitz|1965}}, {{harvnb|Prawitz|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is much easier to show this indirectly by means of a [[cut elimination|cut-free]] [[sequent calculus]] presentation.

==First and higher-order extensions==
[[File:first order natural deduction.png|thumb|right|Summary of first-order system]]

The logic of the earlier section is an example of a ''single-sorted'' logic, ''i.e.'', a logic with a single kind of object: propositions. Many extensions of this simple framework have been proposed; in this section we will extend it with a second sort of ''individuals'' or ''terms''. More precisely, we will add a new kind of judgment, "''t is a term''" (or "''t term''") where ''t'' is schematic. We shall fix a [[countable]] set ''V'' of ''variables'', another countable set ''F'' of ''function symbols'', and construct terms as follows:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 v ∈ V
 ────── var-F
 v term
| width="10%" |  || 
 f ∈ F    t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; term    t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; term  ...  t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; term
 ────────────────────────────────────────── app-F
      f (t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) term
|}
For propositions, we consider a third countable set ''P'' of ''predicates'', and define ''atomic predicates over terms'' with the following formation rule:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 φ ∈ P    t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; term    t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; term   ...   t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; term
 ────────────────────────────────────────── pred-F
      φ (t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., t&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) prop
|}
In addition, we add a pair of ''quantified'' propositions: universal (∀) and existential (∃):
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
  x ∈ V    A prop
 ───────────────── ∀F&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;
    ∀x. A prop
| width="10%" |  || 
  x ∈ V    A prop
 ───────────────── ∃F&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;
    ∃x. A prop
|}
These quantified propositions have the following introduction and elimination rules.
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
   ────── u
   a term
     ⋮
 [a/x] A true
 ──────────── ∀I&lt;sup&gt;u, a&lt;/sup&gt;
 ∀x. A true
| width="10%" |  || 
 ∀x. A true   t term
 ──────────────────── ∀E
   [t/x] A true
|-
|
 [t/x] A true
 ──────────── ∃I
  ∃x. A true
| width="10%" |  || 
                ────── u  ──────────── v
                a term    [a/x] A true
                       ⋮
 ∃x. A true          C true
 ────────────────────────── ∃E&lt;sup&gt;a, u,v&lt;/sup&gt;
            C true
|}
In these rules, the notation [''t''/''x''] ''A'' stands for the substitution of ''t'' for every (visible) instance of ''x'' in ''A'', avoiding capture; see the article on [[lambda calculus]] for more detail about this standard operation. As before the superscripts on the name stand for the components that are discharged: the term ''a'' cannot occur in the conclusion of ∀I (such terms are known as ''eigenvariables'' or ''parameters''), and the hypotheses named ''u'' and ''v'' in ∃E are localised to the second premise in a hypothetical derivation. Although the propositional logic of earlier sections was [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], adding the quantifiers makes the logic undecidable.

So far the quantified extensions are ''first-order'': they distinguish propositions from the kinds of objects quantified over. Higher-order logic takes a different approach and has only a single sort of propositions. The quantifiers have as the domain of quantification the very same sort of propositions, as reflected in the formation rules:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
   ────── u
   p prop
     ⋮
   A prop
 ────────── ∀F&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;
 ∀p. A prop
| width="10%" |  || 
   ────── u
   p prop
     ⋮
   A prop
 ────────── ∃F&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;
 ∃p. A prop
|}
A discussion of the introduction and elimination forms for higher-order logic is beyond the scope of this article. It is possible to be in-between first-order and higher-order logics. For example, second-order logic has two kinds of propositions, one kind quantifying over terms, and the second kind quantifying over propositions of the first kind.

==Different presentations of natural deduction==

===Tree-like presentations===
Gentzen's discharging annotations used to internalise hypothetical judgments can be avoided by representing proofs as a tree of [[sequent]]s ''Γ ⊢A'' instead of a tree of ''A true'' judgments.

===Sequential presentations===
Jaśkowski's representations of natural deduction led to different notations such as [[Fitch-style calculus]] (or Fitch's diagrams) or [[Patrick Suppes|Suppes]]' method, of which [[John Lemmon|Lemmon]] gave a variant called [[system L]]. Such presentation systems, which are more accurately described as tabular, include the following.
* 1940: In a textbook, Quine&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Quine|1981}}. See particularly pages 91–93 for Quine's line-number notation for antecedent dependencies.&lt;/ref&gt; indicated antecedent dependencies by line numbers in square brackets, anticipating Suppes' 1957 line-number notation. 
* 1950: In a textbook, {{harvtxt|Quine|1982|pp=241–255}} demonstrated a method of using one or more asterisks to the left of each line of proof to indicate dependencies.

==Proofs and type theory==
The presentation of natural deduction so far has concentrated on the nature of propositions without giving a formal definition of a ''proof''. To formalise the notion of proof, we alter the presentation of hypothetical derivations slightly. We label the antecedents with ''proof variables'' (from some countable set ''V'' of variables), and decorate the succedent with the actual proof. The antecedents or ''hypotheses'' are separated from the succedent by means of a ''[[Turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]]'' (⊢). This modification sometimes goes under the name of ''localised hypotheses''. The following diagram summarises the change.
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"

|}
The collection of hypotheses will be written as Γ when their exact composition is not relevant.
To make proofs explicit, we move from the proof-less judgment "''A true''" to a judgment: "π ''is a proof of (A true)''", which is written symbolically as "π : ''A true''". Following the standard approach, proofs are specified with their own formation rules for the judgment "π ''proof''". The simplest possible proof is the use of a labelled hypothesis; in this case the evidence is the label itself.
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-

|}
For brevity, we shall leave off the judgmental label ''true'' in the rest of this article, ''i.e.'', write "Γ ⊢ π : ''A''". Let us re-examine some of the connectives with explicit proofs. For conjunction, we look at the introduction rule ∧I to discover the form of proofs of conjunction: they must be a pair of proofs of the two conjuncts. Thus:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; proof    π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; proof
 ──────────────────── pair-F

 ------------------------ ∧I
 Γ ⊢ (π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) : A ∧ B
|}
The elimination rules ∧E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ∧E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; select either the left or the right conjunct; thus the proofs are a pair of projections&amp;mdash;first ('''fst''') and second ('''snd''').

For implication, the introduction form localises or ''binds'' the hypothesis, written using a λ; this corresponds to the discharged label. In the rule, "Γ, ''u'':''A''" stands for the collection of hypotheses Γ, together with the additional hypothesis ''u''.

With proofs available explicitly, one can manipulate and reason about proofs. The key operation on proofs is the substitution of one proof for an assumption used in another proof. This is commonly known as a ''substitution theorem'', and can be proved by [[mathematical induction|induction]] on the depth (or structure) of the second judgment.

; Substitution theorem : ''If'' Γ ⊢ π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''A'' ''and'' Γ, ''u'':''A'' ⊢ π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''B'', ''then'' Γ ⊢ [π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''u''] π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : B.

So far the judgment "Γ ⊢ π : ''A''" has had a purely logical interpretation. In [[type theory]], the logical view is exchanged for a more computational view of objects. Propositions in the logical interpretation are now viewed as ''types'', and proofs as programs in the [[lambda calculus]]. Thus the interpretation of "π : ''A''" is "''the program'' π has type ''A''". The logical connectives are also given a different reading: conjunction is viewed as product (×), implication as the function arrow (→), etc. The differences are only cosmetic, however. Type theory has a natural deduction presentation in terms of formation, introduction and elimination rules; in fact, the reader can easily reconstruct what is known as ''simple type theory'' from the previous sections.

The difference between logic and type theory is primarily a shift of focus from the types (propositions) to the programs (proofs). Type theory is chiefly interested in the convertibility or reducibility of programs. For every type, there are canonical programs of that type which are irreducible; these are known as ''canonical forms'' or ''values''. If every program can be reduced to a canonical form, then the type theory is said to be ''normalising'' (or ''weakly normalising''). If the canonical form is unique, then the theory is said to be ''strongly normalising''. Normalisability is a rare feature of most non-trivial type theories, which is a big departure from the logical world. (Recall that almost every logical derivation has an equivalent normal derivation.) To sketch the reason: in type theories that admit recursive definitions, it is possible to write programs that never reduce to a value; such looping programs can generally be given any type. In particular, the looping program has type ⊥, although there is no logical proof of "⊥ ''true''". For this reason, the ''propositions as types; proofs as programs'' paradigm only works in one direction, if at all: interpreting a type theory as a logic generally gives an inconsistent logic.

===Example: Dependent Type Theory===
Like logic, type theory has many extensions and variants, including first-order and higher-order versions. One branch, known as [[dependent type theory]], is used in a number of [[computer-assisted proof]] systems.  Dependent type theory allows quantifiers to range over programs themselves. These quantified types are written as Π and Σ instead of ∀ and ∃, and have the following formation rules:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 Γ ⊢ A type    Γ, x:A ⊢ B type
 ───────────────────────────── Π-F
 Γ ⊢ Πx:A. B type
| width="10%" |  || 
 Γ ⊢ A type  Γ, x:A ⊢ B type
 ──────────────────────────── Σ-F
 Γ ⊢ Σx:A. B type
|}
These types are generalisations of the arrow and product types, respectively, as witnessed by their introduction and elimination rules.
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|

 ──────────────────── ΠI
 Γ ⊢ λx. π : Πx:A. B

 ──────────────────────── ΣE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
 Γ ⊢ '''snd''' π : ['''fst''' π/x] B
|}
Dependent type theory in full generality is very powerful: it is able to express almost any conceivable property of programs directly in the types of the program. This generality comes at a steep price &amp;mdash; either typechecking is undecidable ([[extensional type theory]]), or extensional reasoning is more difficult ([[intensional type theory]]). For this reason, some dependent type theories do not allow quantification over arbitrary programs, but rather restrict to programs of a given decidable ''index domain'', for example integers, strings, or linear programs.

Since dependent type theories allow types to depend on programs, a natural question to ask is whether it is possible for programs to depend on types, or any other combination. There are many kinds of answers to such questions. A popular approach in type theory is to allow programs to be quantified over types, also known as ''parametric polymorphism''; of this there are two main kinds: if types and programs are kept separate, then one obtains a somewhat more well-behaved system called ''predicative polymorphism''; if the distinction between program and type is blurred, one obtains the type-theoretic analogue of higher-order logic, also known as ''impredicative polymorphism''. Various combinations of dependency and polymorphism have been considered in the literature, the most famous being the [[lambda cube]] of [[Henk Barendregt]].

The intersection of logic and type theory is a vast and active research area. New logics are usually formalised in a general type theoretic setting, known as a [[logical framework]]. Popular modern logical frameworks such as the [[calculus of constructions]] and [[LF (logical framework)|LF]] are based on higher-order dependent type theory, with various trade-offs in terms of decidability and expressive power. These logical frameworks are themselves always specified as natural deduction systems, which is a testament to the versatility of the natural deduction approach.

==Classical and modal logics==
For simplicity, the logics presented so far have been [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]]. [[Classical logic]] extends intuitionistic logic with an additional [[axiom]] or principle of [[excluded middle]]:

:''For any proposition p, the proposition p ∨ ¬p is true.''

This statement is not obviously either an introduction or an elimination; indeed, it involves two distinct connectives. Gentzen's original treatment of excluded middle prescribed one of the following three (equivalent) formulations, which were already present in analogous forms in the systems of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] and [[Arend Heyting|Heyting]]:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 ────────────── XM&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
 A ∨ ¬A true
| width="5%" |  || 
 ¬¬A true
 ────────── XM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
 A true
| width="5%" |  || 
 ──────── ''u''
 ¬A true
 ⋮
 ''p'' true
 ────── XM&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''u, p''&lt;/sup&gt;
 A true
|}

(XM&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is merely XM&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; expressed in terms of E.) This treatment of excluded middle, in addition to being objectionable from a purist's standpoint, introduces additional complications in the definition of normal forms.

A comparatively more satisfactory treatment of classical natural deduction in terms of introduction and elimination rules alone was first proposed by [[Michel Parigot|Parigot]] in 1992 in the form of a classical [[lambda calculus]] called [[Lambda-mu calculus|λμ]]. The key insight of his approach was to replace a truth-centric judgment ''A true'' with a more classical notion, reminiscent of the [[sequent calculus]]: in localised form, instead of Γ ⊢ ''A'', he used Γ ⊢ Δ, with Δ a collection of propositions similar to Γ. Γ was treated as a conjunction, and Δ as a disjunction. This structure is essentially lifted directly from classical [[sequent calculus|sequent calculi]], but the innovation in λμ was to give a computational meaning to classical natural deduction proofs in terms of a [[callcc]] or a throw/catch mechanism seen in [[LISP]] and its descendants. (See also: [[first class control]].)

Another important extension was for [[modal logic|modal]] and other logics that need more than just the basic judgment of truth. These were first described, for the alethic modal logics S4 and S5, in a natural deduction style by [[Dag Prawitz|Prawitz]] in 1965,&lt;ref name=prawitz1965 /&gt; and have since accumulated a large body of related work. To give a simple example, the modal logic S4 requires one new judgment, "''A valid''", that is categorical with respect to truth:

:''If "A true" under no assumptions of the form "B true", then "A valid".''

This categorical judgment is internalised as a unary connective ◻''A'' (read "''necessarily A''") with the following introduction and elimination rules:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 A valid
 ──────── ◻I
 ◻ A true
| width="5%" |  || 
 ◻ A true
 ──────── ◻E
 A true
|}

Note that the premise "''A valid''" has no defining rules; instead, the categorical definition of validity is used in its place. This mode becomes clearer in the localised form when the hypotheses are explicit. We write "Ω;Γ ⊢ ''A true''" where Γ contains the true hypotheses as before, and Ω contains valid hypotheses. On the right there is just a single judgment "''A true''"; validity is not needed here since "Ω ⊢ ''A valid''" is by definition the same as "Ω;⋅ ⊢ ''A true''". The introduction and elimination forms are then:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 Ω;⋅ ⊢ π : A true
 ──────────────────── ◻I
 Ω;⋅ ⊢ '''box''' π : ◻ A true
| width="5%" |  || 
 Ω;Γ ⊢ π : ◻ A true
 ────────────────────── ◻E
 Ω;Γ ⊢ '''unbox''' π : A true
|}

The modal hypotheses have their own version of the hypothesis rule and substitution theorem.
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 ─────────────────────────────── valid-hyp
 Ω, u: (A valid) ; Γ ⊢ u : A true
|}

; Modal substitution theorem : ''If'' Ω;⋅ ⊢ π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''A true'' ''and'' Ω, ''u'': (''A valid'') ; Γ ⊢ π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''C true'', ''then'' Ω;Γ ⊢ [π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''u''] π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''C true''.

This framework of separating judgments into distinct collections of hypotheses, also known as ''multi-zoned'' or ''polyadic'' contexts, is very powerful and extensible; it has been applied for many different modal logics, and also for [[linear logic|linear]] and other [[substructural logic]]s, to give a few examples.  However, relatively few systems of modal logic can be formalised directly in natural deduction. To give proof-theoretic characterisations of these systems, extensions such as labelling or systems of deep inference.

The addition of labels to formulae permits much finer control of the conditions under which rules apply, allowing the more flexible techniques of [[analytic tableau]]x to be applied, as has been done in the case of [[labelled deduction]].  Labels also allow the naming of worlds in Kripke semantics; {{harvtxt|Simpson|1993}} presents an influential technique for converting frame conditions of modal logics in Kripke semantics into inference rules in a natural deduction formalisation of [[hybrid logic]]. {{harvtxt|Stouppa|2004}} surveys the application of many proof theories, such as Avron and Pottinger's [[hypersequent]]s and Belnap's [[display logic]] to such modal logics as S5 and B.

==Comparison with other foundational approaches==

===Sequent calculus===
{{Main|Sequent calculus}}

The sequent calculus is the chief alternative to natural deduction as a foundation of [[mathematical logic]]. In natural deduction the flow of information is bi-directional: elimination rules flow information downwards by deconstruction, and introduction rules flow information upwards by assembly. Thus, a natural deduction proof does not have a purely bottom-up or top-down reading, making it unsuitable for automation in proof search. To address this fact, [[Gerhard Gentzen|Gentzen]] in 1935 proposed his [[sequent calculus]], though he initially intended it as a technical device for clarifying the consistency of [[predicate logic]]. [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]], in his seminal 1952 book ''Introduction to Metamathematics'', gave the first formulation of the sequent calculus in the modern style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kleene|2009|pp=440–516}}. See also {{harvnb|Kleene|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sequent calculus all inference rules have a purely bottom-up reading. Inference rules can apply to elements on both sides of the [[Turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]]. (To differentiate from natural deduction, this article uses a double arrow ⇒ instead of the right tack ⊢ for sequents.) The introduction rules of natural deduction are viewed as ''right rules'' in the sequent calculus, and are structurally very similar. The elimination rules on the other hand turn into ''left rules'' in the sequent calculus. To give an example, consider disjunction; the right rules are familiar:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 Γ ⇒ A
 ───────── ∨R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
 Γ ⇒ A ∨ B
| with="10%" |  || 
 Γ ⇒ B
 ───────── ∨R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
 Γ ⇒ A ∨ B
|}
On the left:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 Γ, u:A ⇒ C       Γ, v:B ⇒ C
 ─────────────────────────── ∨L
 Γ, w: (A ∨ B) ⇒ C
|}
Recall the ∨E rule of natural deduction in localised form:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 Γ ⊢ A ∨ B    Γ, u:A ⊢ C    Γ, v:B ⊢ C
 ─────────────────────────────────────── ∨E
 Γ ⊢ C
|}
The proposition ''A ∨ B'', which is the succedent of a premise in ∨E, turns into a hypothesis of the conclusion in the left rule ∨L. Thus, left rules can be seen as a sort of inverted elimination rule. This observation can be illustrated as follows:
{| align="center"
|-
! natural deduction
|
! sequent calculus
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;
 ────── hyp
 |

 ↑            ↑
 |            |
 | left rules | right rules
 |            |
 conclusion&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
In the sequent calculus, the left and right rules are performed in lock-step until one reaches the ''initial sequent'', which corresponds to the meeting point of elimination and introduction rules in natural deduction. These initial rules are superficially similar to the hypothesis rule of natural deduction, but in the sequent calculus they describe a ''transposition'' or a ''handshake'' of a left and a right proposition:
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
|
 ────────── init
 Γ, u:A ⇒ A
|}
The correspondence between the sequent calculus and natural deduction is a pair of soundness and completeness theorems, which are both provable by means of an inductive argument.

; Soundness of ⇒ wrt. ⊢ : ''If'' Γ ⇒ ''A'', ''then'' Γ ⊢ ''A''.
; Completeness of ⇒ wrt. ⊢ : ''If'' Γ ⊢ ''A'', ''then'' Γ ⇒ ''A''.

It is clear by these theorems that the sequent calculus does not change the notion of truth, because the same collection of propositions remain true. Thus, one can use the same proof objects as before in sequent calculus derivations. As an example, consider the conjunctions. The right rule is virtually identical to the introduction rule
{| style="margin-left: 2em;"
|-
! sequent calculus
|

 ───────────────────────── ∧I
 Γ ⊢ (π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) : A ∧ B
|}
The left rule, however, performs some additional substitutions that are not performed in the corresponding elimination rules.

 Γ ⊢ '''snd''' π : B
|}

The kinds of proofs generated in the sequent calculus are therefore rather different from those of natural deduction. The sequent calculus produces proofs in what is known as the ''β-normal η-long'' form, which corresponds to a canonical representation of the normal form of the natural deduction proof. If one attempts to describe these proofs using natural deduction itself, one obtains what is called the ''intercalation calculus'' (first described by John Byrnes), which can be used to formally define the notion of a ''normal form'' for natural deduction.

The substitution theorem of natural deduction takes the form of a [[structural rule]] or structural theorem known as ''cut'' in the sequent calculus.

; Cut (substitution) : ''If'' Γ ⇒ π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''A'' ''and'' Γ, ''u'':''A'' ⇒ π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''C'', ''then'' Γ ⇒ [π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/u] π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''C''.

In most well behaved logics, cut is unnecessary as an inference rule, though it remains provable as a [[meta-theorem]]; the superfluousness of the cut rule is usually presented as a computational process, known as ''cut elimination''. This has an interesting application for natural deduction; usually it is extremely tedious to prove certain properties directly in natural deduction because of an unbounded number of cases. For example, consider showing that a given proposition is ''not'' provable in natural deduction. A simple inductive argument fails because of rules like ∨E or E which can introduce arbitrary propositions. However, we know that the sequent calculus is complete with respect to natural deduction, so it is enough to show this unprovability in the sequent calculus. Now, if cut is not available as an inference rule, then all sequent rules either introduce a connective on the right or the left, so the depth of a sequent derivation is fully bounded by the connectives in the final conclusion. Thus, showing unprovability is much easier, because there are only a finite number of cases to consider, and each case is composed entirely of sub-propositions of the conclusion. A simple instance of this is the ''global consistency'' theorem: "⋅ ⊢ ⊥ ''true''" is not provable. In the sequent calculus version, this is manifestly true because there is no rule that can have "⋅ ⇒ ⊥" as a conclusion! Proof theorists often prefer to work on cut-free sequent calculus formulations because of such properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10552">In [[number theory]], the '''Néron–Tate height''' (or '''canonical height''') is a [[quadratic form]] on the [[Mordell-Weil group]] of [[rational points]] of an [[abelian variety]] defined over a [[global field]].  It is named after [[André Néron]] and [[John Tate]].

==Definition and properties==
Néron defined the Néron–Tate height as a sum of local heights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=André | last=Néron | title=Quasi-fonctions et hauteurs sur les variétés abéliennes | journal=[[Ann. of Math.]] |  volume=82 | year=1965 | pages=249–331 | doi=10.2307/1970644 | mr=0179173 | language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the global Néron–Tate height is quadratic, the constituent local heights are not quite quadratic. Tate (unpublished) defined it globally by observing that the [[Height_function#H|logarithmic height]] &lt;math&gt;h_L&lt;/math&gt; associated to a symmetric [[invertible sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; on an [[abelian variety]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is “almost quadratic,” and used this to show that the limit

:&lt;math&gt;\hat h_L(P) = \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\frac{h_L(NP)}{N^2}&lt;/math&gt;

exists, defines a quadratic form on the Mordell-Weil group of rational points, and satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\hat h_L(P) = h_L(P) + O(1),&lt;/math&gt;

where the implied &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; constant is independent of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=L72&gt;Lang (1997) p.72&lt;/ref&gt; If &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is anti-symmetric, that is &lt;math&gt;[-1]^*L=L&lt;/math&gt;, then the analogous limit 

:&lt;math&gt;\hat h_L(P) = \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\frac{h_L(NP)}{N}&lt;/math&gt;

converges and satisfies &lt;math&gt;\hat h_L(P) = h_L(P) + O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, but in this case &lt;math&gt;\hat h_L&lt;/math&gt; is a linear function on the Mordell-Weil group. For general invertible sheaves, one writes &lt;math&gt;L^{\otimes2} = (L\otimes[-1]^*L)\otimes(L\otimes[-1]^*L^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; as a product of a symmetric sheaf and an anti-symmetric sheaf, and then

:&lt;math&gt;\hat h_L(P) = \frac12 \hat h_{L\otimes[-1]^*L}(P) + \frac12 \hat h_{L\otimes[-1]^*L^{-1}}(P)&lt;/math&gt;

is the unique quadratic function satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\hat h_L(P) = h_L(P) + O(1) \quad\mbox{and}\quad \hat h_L(0)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The Néron–Tate height depends on the choice of an invertible sheaf on the abelian variety, although the associated bilinear form depends only on the image of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in
the [[Néron–Severi group]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. If the abelian variety &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined over a number field ''K'' and the invertible sheaf is symmetric and ample, then the Néron–Tate height is positive definite in the sense that it vanishes only on torsion elements of the Mordell-Weil group &lt;math&gt;A(K)&lt;/math&gt;. More generally, &lt;math&gt;\hat h_L&lt;/math&gt; induces a positive definite quadratic form on the real vector space &lt;math&gt;A(K)\otimes\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

On an [[elliptic curve]], the Néron-Severi group is of rank one and has a unique ample generator, so this generator is often used to define the Néron–Tate height, which is denoted &lt;math&gt;\hat h&lt;/math&gt; without reference to a particular line bundle. (However, the height that naturally appears in the statement of the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is twice this height.) On  abelian varieties of higher dimension, there need not be a particular choice of smallest ample line bundle to be used in defining the Néron–Tate height, and the height used in the statement of the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is the Néron–Tate height associated to the [[Poincare_line_bundle|Poincaré line bundle]] on &lt;math&gt;A\times\hat A&lt;/math&gt;, the product of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with its [[Dual_abelian_variety|dual]].

==The elliptic and abelian regulators==
The bilinear form associated to the canonical height &lt;math&gt;\hat h&lt;/math&gt; on an elliptic curve ''E'' is  

:&lt;math&gt; \langle P,Q\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \bigl( \hat h(P+Q) - \hat h(P) - \hat h(Q) \bigr) .&lt;/math&gt;

The '''elliptic regulator''' of ''E/K'' is

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Reg}(E/K) = \det\bigl( \langle P_i,P_j\rangle \bigr)_{1\le i,j\le r},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a basis for the Mordell-Weil group ''E''(''K'') modulo torsion  (cf. [[Gram determinant]]). The elliptic regulator does not depend on the choice of basis. 

More generally, let ''A/K'' be an abelian variety, let  ''B'' ≅ Pic&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'') be the dual abelian variety to ''A'', and let ''P'' be the [[Poincaré line bundle]] on ''A'' &amp;times; ''B''. Then the '''abelian regulator''' of ''A/K'' is defined by choosing a basis ''Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the Mordell-Weil group ''A''(''K'') modulo torsion and a basis η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,η&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; for the Mordell-Weil group ''B''(''K'') modulo torsion and setting

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Reg}(A/K) = \det\bigl( \langle Q_i,\eta_j\rangle_{P} \bigr)_{1\le i,j\le r}.&lt;/math&gt;

(The definitions of elliptic and abelian regulator are not entirely consistent, since if ''A'' is an elliptic curve, then the latter is 2&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; times the former.)

The elliptic and abelian regulators appear in the [[Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]].

==Lower bounds for the Néron–Tate height==
There are two fundamental conjectures that give lower bounds for the Néron–Tate height. In the first, the field ''K'' is fixed and the elliptic curve  ''E/K''  and point ''P ∈ E(K)'' vary, while in the second, the [[elliptic Lehmer conjecture]], the curve ''E/K'' is fixed while the field of definition of the point ''P'' varies. 

* (Lang)&lt;ref name=L734&gt;Lang (1997) pp.73–74&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt; \hat h(P) \ge c(K) \log\max\bigl\{\operatorname{Norm}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}\operatorname{Disc}(E/K),h(j(E))\bigr\}\quad&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;E/K&lt;/math&gt; and all nontorsion &lt;math&gt;P\in E(K).&lt;/math&gt;
* (Lehmer)&lt;ref name=L243&gt;Lang (1997) pp.243&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\hat h(P) \ge \frac{c(E/K)}{[K(P):K]}&lt;/math&gt; for all nontorsion &lt;math&gt;P\in E(\bar K).&lt;/math&gt;

In both conjectures, the constants are positive and depend only on the indicated quantities. (A stronger form of Lang's conjecture asserts that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; depends only on the degree &lt;math&gt;[K:\mathbb Q]&lt;/math&gt;.) It is known that the [[Abc conjecture|''abc'' conjecture]] implies Lang's conjecture, and that the analogue of Lang's conjecture over one dimensional characteristic 0 function fields  is unconditionally true.&lt;ref name=L734/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Marc |last1=Hindry |first2=Joseph H. |last2=Silverman | authorlink2=Joseph H.

==Generalizations==
A polarized [[arithmetic dynamics|algebraic dynamical system]] is a triple (''V'',φ,''L'') consisting of a (smooth projective) algebraic variety ''V'', a self-morphism φ : V → V, and a line bundle ''L'' on ''V'' with the property that &lt;math&gt;\phi^*L = L^{\otimes d}&lt;/math&gt; for some integer ''d'' &gt; 1. The associated canonical height is given by the Tate limit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Gregory S. | last1=Call | first2=Joseph H. | last2=Silverman | title=Canonical heights on varieties with morphisms | journal=[[Compositio Mathematica]] | volume=89 | year=1993 | pages=163–205 | issue=2 | mr=1255693 | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=CM_1993__89_2_163_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \hat h_{V,\phi,L}(P) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{h_{V,L}(\phi^{(n)}(P))}{d^n}, &lt;/math&gt;

where φ&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; = φ o φ o … o φ is the ''n''-fold iteration of φ. For example, any morphism φ : '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; of degree ''d'' &gt; 1 yields a canonical height associated to the line bundle relation φ*''O''(1) = ''O''(''d''). If ''V'' is defined over a number field and ''L'' is ample, then the canonical height is non-negative, and

:&lt;math&gt; \hat h_{V,\phi,L}(P) = 0 ~~ \Longleftrightarrow ~~ P~{\rm is~preperiodic~for~}\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

(''P'' is preperiodic if its forward orbit ''P'', φ(''P''), φ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''P''), φ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''P''),… contains only finitely many distinct points.)

'''Object-oriented software engineering''' (commonly known by acronym '''OOSE''') is an [[object-modeling language]] and [[methodology]].

OOSE was developed by [[Ivar Jacobson]] in 1992 while at [[Objectory AB]]. It is the first [[object-oriented design]] methodology to employ [[use case]]s to drive [[software design]]. It also uses other design products similar to those used by [[Object-modeling technique]].

It was documented in the 1992 book ''Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach'', {{ISBN|0-201-54435-0}}

The tool [[Objectory]] was created by the team at Objectory AB to implement the OOSE methodology. After success in the marketplace, other tool vendors also supported OOSE.

After [[Rational Software]] bought Objectory AB, the OOSE notation, methodology, and tools became superseded.

*As one of the primary sources of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), concepts and notation from OOSE have been incorporated into UML.
*The methodology part of OOSE has since evolved into the [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP).
*The OOSE tools have been replaced by tools supporting UML and RUP.

OOSE has been largely replaced by the UML notation and by the RUP methodology.

Main Issues:
1. Software products can get very complex.
2. High-quality results are expected.
3. The development team can be large and distributed.
4. Most projects add functionality to an existing product.

'''''UML color''''' standards are a set of four colors associated with [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) diagrams. The coloring system indicates which of several '''archetypes''' apply to the UML object. UML typically identifies a '''[[stereotype (UML)|stereotype]]''' with a bracketed comment for each object identifying whether it is a class, interface, etc.

These colors were first suggested by [[Peter Coad]], [[Eric Lefebvre]], and [[Jeff De Luca]] in a series of articles in ''The Coad Letter'',{{ref|TheCoadLetter}}{{ref|TheCoadLetter44}} and later published in their book ''Java Modeling In Color With UML''.{{ref|Coad}}

Over hundreds of domain models, it became clear that four major "types" of classes appeared again and again, though they had different names in different domains. After much discussion, these were termed '''archetypes''', which is meant to convey that the classes of a given archetype follow more or less the same form. That is, [[attribute (computing)|attributes]], [[method (computer science)|methods]], [[association (object-oriented programming)|associations]], and [[protocol (object-oriented programming)|interfaces]] are fairly similar among classes of a given archetype.

When attempting to classify a given domain class, one typically asks about the color standards in this order:

:;pink:moment-interval — Does it represent a moment or interval of time that we need to remember and work with for legal or business reasons? Examples in business systems generally model activities involving people, places and things such as a sale, an order, a rental, an employment, making a journey, etc.
:;yellow:roles — Is it a way of participating in an activity (by either a person, place, or thing)? A person playing the role of an employee in an employment, a thing playing the role of a product in a sale, a location playing the role of a classroom for a training course, are examples of roles.
:;blue:description — Is it simply a catalog-entry-like description which classifies or 'labels' an object? For example, the make and model of a car categorises or describes a number of physical vehicles. The relationship between the blue description and green party, place or thing is a type-instance relationship based on differences in the values of data items held in the 'type' object.
:;green:party, place, or thing — Something tangible, uniquely identifiable. Typically the role-players in a system.  People are green. Organizations are green. The physical objects involved in a rental such as the physical DVDs are green things. Normally, if you get through the above three questions and end up here, your class is a "green."

Although the actual colors vary, most systems tend to use lighter color palettes so that black text can also be easily read on a colored background. Coad, et al., used the 4-color pastel [[Post-it note]]s,{{ref|TheCoadLetter44}} and later had UML modeling tools support the color scheme by associating a color to one or more class stereotypes.

Many people feel colored objects appeal to the pattern recognition section of the brain.  Others advocate that you can begin a modeling process with a stack of four-color note cards or colored sticky notes.

The value of color modeling was especially obvious when standing back from a model drawn or projected on a wall. That extra dimension allowed modelers to see important aspects of the models (the pink classes, for instance), and to spot areas that may need reviewing (unusual combinations of color classes linked together).

The technique also made it easy to help determine aspects of the domain model – especially for newcomers to modeling. For example, by simply looking first for "pinks" in the domain, it was easy to begin to get some important classes identified for a given domain. It was also easy to review the standard types of attributes, methods, and so on, for applicability to the current domain effort.

The '''ordered exponential''', also called the '''path-ordered exponential''', is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] operation defined in [[non-commutative]] [[algebra over a field|algebras]], equivalent to the [[exponential function|exponential]] of the [[integral]] in the [[commutative]] algebras.  In practice the ordered exponential is used in [[matrix (math)|matrix]] and [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] algebras.

== Definition ==

Let ''A'' be an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] over a [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', and ''a''(''t'') be a [[function (mathematics)|parameterized]] element of ''A'',

: &lt;math&gt;a \mathrel{:} K \to A. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The parameter ''t'' in ''a''(''t'') is often referred to as the ''time parameter'' in this context.

The ordered exponential of ''a'' is denoted

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\operatorname{OE}[a](t) \equiv \mathcal{T} \left\{e^{\int_0^t a(t') \, dt'}\right\} &amp; \equiv \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} \int_0^t \cdots \int_0^t \mathcal{T} \left\{a(t'_1) \cdots a(t'_{n})\right\} \, dt'_1 \cdots dt'_{n} \\
&amp; \equiv \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \int_0^t \int_0^{t'_n} \int_0^{t'_{n-1}} \cdots \int_0^{t'_{2}} a(t'_{n}) \cdots a(t'_{1}) \, dt'_1 \cdots dt'_{n-2} dt'_{n-1} dt'_{n} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the term ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is equal to 1 and
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a higher-order operation that ensures the exponential is [[Path-ordering#Time_ordering|time-ordered]]: any product of ''a''(''t'') that occurs in the expansion of the exponential must be ordered such that the value of ''t'' is increasing from right to left of the product; a schematic example:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T} \left\{a(1.2) a(9.5) a(4.1)\right\} = a(9.5) a(4.1) a(1.2).&lt;/math&gt;
This restriction is necessary as products in the algebra are not necessarily commutative.

The operation maps a parameterized element onto another parameterized element, or symbolically,
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{OE} \mathrel{:} \left(K \to A\right) \to \left(K \to A\right). &lt;/math&gt;

There are various ways to define this integral more rigorously.

=== Product of exponentials ===

The ordered exponential can be defined as the left [[product integral]] of the [[infinitesimal]] exponentials, or equivalently, as an [[ordered product]] of exponentials in the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] as the number of terms grows to infinity:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{OE}[a](t) = \prod_0^t e^{a(t') \, dt'} \equiv
    \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \left(
      e^{a(t_N) \, \Delta t} e^{a(t_{N-1}) \, \Delta t} \cdots
      e^{a(t_1) \, \Delta t} e^{a(t_0) \, \Delta t}
    \right)
  &lt;/math&gt;

where the time moments {{nowrap|&amp;#123;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#125;}} are defined as {{nowrap|''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ''i'' Δ''t''}} for {{nowrap|''i'' {{=}} 0, …, ''N''}}, and {{nowrap|Δ''t'' ≡ ''t'' / ''N''}}.

The ordered exponential is in fact a [[Product integral#Type II|geometric integral]].&lt;ref name=nnc&gt;Michael Grossman and Robert Katz. [https://books.google.com/books?q=%22Non-Newtonian+Calculus%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0 ''Non-Newtonian Calculus''], {{ISBN|0912938013}}, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Bashirov, E. M. Kurpınar, A. Özyapıcı. [http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022247X07003824 ''Multiplicative calculus and its applications''], Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;ref name=FvA&gt;Luc Florack and Hans van Assen.[http://www.springerlink.com/content/82057067845wx7v6/ "Multiplicative calculus in biomedical image analysis"], Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solution to a differential equation ===

The ordered exponential is unique solution of the [[initial value problem]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \frac{d}{d t} \operatorname{OE}[a](t) &amp;= a(t) \operatorname{OE}[a](t) \text{,} \\[5pt]
    \operatorname{OE}[a](0) &amp;= 1 \text{.}
  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Solution to an integral equation ===

The ordered exponential is the solution to the [[integral equation]]:

:: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{OE}[a](t) = 1 + \int_0^t a(t') \operatorname{OE}[a](t') \, dt'. &lt;/math&gt;

This equation is equivalent to the previous initial value problem.

=== Infinite series expansion ===

The ordered exponential can be defined as an infinite sum,

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{OE}[a](t) = 1 + \int_0^t a(t_1) \, dt_1+ \int_0^t \int_0^{t_1} a(t_1) a(t_2) \, dt_2 \, dt_1 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be derived by recursively substituting the integral equation into itself.

== Example ==

Given a manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; where for a &lt;math&gt;e \in TM&lt;/math&gt; with [[Group theory|group]] transformation &lt;math&gt;g: e \mapsto g e&lt;/math&gt; it holds at a point &lt;math&gt;x \in M&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;de(x) + \operatorname{J}(x)e(x) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[exterior differentiation]] and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{J}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the connection operator (1-form field) acting on &lt;math&gt;e(x)&lt;/math&gt;. When integrating above equation it holds (now, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{J}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the connection operator expressed in a coordinate basis)

: &lt;math&gt;e(y) = \operatorname{P} \exp \left(- \int_x^y J(\gamma (t)) \gamma '(t) \, dt \right) e(x)&lt;/math&gt;

with the path-ordering operator &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}&lt;/math&gt; that orders factors in order of the path &lt;math&gt;\gamma(t) \in M&lt;/math&gt;. For the special case that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{J}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Antisymmetry|antisymmetric]] operator and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal rectangle with edge lengths &lt;math&gt;|u|,|v|&lt;/math&gt; and corners at points &lt;math&gt;x,x+u,x+u+v,x+v,&lt;/math&gt; above expression simplifies as follows :

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \operatorname{OE}[- \operatorname{J}]e(x) \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; \exp [- \operatorname{J}(x+v) (-v)] \exp [- \operatorname{J}(x+u+v) (-u)] \exp [- \operatorname{J}(x+u) v] \exp [- \operatorname{J}(x) u] e(x) \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; [1 - \operatorname{J}(x+v) (-v)][1 - \operatorname{J}(x+u+v) (-u)][1 - \operatorname{J}(x+u) v][1 - \operatorname{J}(x) u] e(x).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, it holds the group transformation identity &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{OE}[- \operatorname{J}] \mapsto g \operatorname{OE}[\operatorname{J}] g^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;- \operatorname{J}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth connection, expanding above quantity to second order in infinitesimal quantities &lt;math&gt;|u|,|v|&lt;/math&gt; one obtains for the ordered exponential the identity with a correction term that is proportional to the [[Riemann curvature tensor| curvature tensor]].

'''PORS''' stands for Plus One Recall Store. It is a problem used in [[evolutionary computation]] and [[genetic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kz0rofjQrwYC&amp;lpg=PA215&amp;ots=zECFAmBXB1&amp;dq=PORS%20language&amp;pg=PA215#v=onepage&amp;q=PORS%20language&amp;f=false 8.2 The PORS Language], Page 215, Evolutionary Computation for Modeling And Optimization - Daniel Ashlock - Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

The PORS language consists of two terminal nodes (1 and recall), one unary operation (store) and one binary operation (plus) that together make up a [[parse tree]] that calculates a number.

{{lead too short|date=August 2018}}
In [[cryptography]], '''padding''' refers to a number of distinct practices.

==Classical cryptography==
Official messages often start and end in predictable ways: ''My dear ambassador, Weather report, Sincerely yours'', etc. The primary use of padding with [[classical cipher]]s is to prevent the cryptanalyst from using that predictability to find [[Known-plaintext attack|known plaintext]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Welchman]], ''The Hut Six Story: Breaking the Enigma Codes'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; that aids in breaking the encryption. Random length padding also prevents an attacker from knowing the exact length of the plaintext message.

Many classical ciphers arrange the plaintext into particular patterns (e.g., squares, rectangles, etc.) and if the plaintext doesn't exactly fit, it is often necessary to supply additional letters to fill out the pattern. Using nonsense letters for this purpose has a side benefit of making some kinds of cryptanalysis more difficult.

A famous example of classical padding which caused a great misunderstanding is "[[the world wonders]]".
&lt;!--Such padding is not used in modern cryptography, because modern ciphers are designed to be secure even when the cryptanalyst chooses the message to encrypt.--&gt;

==Symmetric cryptography==

===Hash functions===
Most modern [[cryptographic hash function]]s process messages in fixed-length blocks; all but the earliest hash functions include some sort of padding scheme. It is critical for cryptographic hash functions to employ termination schemes that prevent a hash from being vulnerable to [[length extension attack]]s.

Many padding schemes are based on appending predictable data to the final block. For example, the pad could be derived from the total length of the message. This kind of padding scheme is commonly applied to hash algorithms that use the [[Merkle–Damgård construction]].

===Block cipher mode of operation===
[[Block cipher modes of operation#Electronic codebook (ECB)|Electronic codebook]] and [[Block cipher modes of operation#Cipher-block chaining (CBC)|cipher-block chaining]] (CBC) mode are examples of [[block cipher mode of operation]]. Block cipher modes for [[symmetric-key encryption algorithm]]s require plain text input that is a multiple of the block size, so messages may have to be padded to bring them to this length.

{{Disputed section|date=January 2016}}
There is currently{{when|date=November 2013}} a shift to use streaming mode of operation instead of block mode of operation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}  An example of streaming mode encryption is the [[Block cipher modes of operation#Counter .28CTR.29|counter mode of operation]] [[&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/classes/s09/l05.pdf, pg 17&lt;/ref&gt;]]. Streaming modes of operation can encrypt and decrypt messages of any size and therefore do not require padding.  More intricate ways of ending a message such as [[ciphertext stealing]] or [[residual block termination]] avoid the need for padding.

A disadvantage of padding is that it makes the plain text of the message susceptible to [[padding oracle attack]]s. Padding oracle attacks allow the attacker to gain knowledge of the plain text without attacking the block cipher primitive itself. Padding oracle attacks can be avoided by making sure that an attacker cannot gain knowledge about the removal of the padding bytes. This can be accomplished by verifying a [[Message authentication code|message authentication code (MAC)]] or [[digital signature]] ''before'' removal of the padding bytes, or by switching to a streaming mode of operation.

====Bit padding====
Bit padding can be applied to messages of any size.

A single set ('1') bit is added to the message and then as many reset ('0') bits as required (possibly none) are added.  The number of reset ('0') bits added will depend on the block boundary to which the message needs to be extended.  In bit terms this is "1000 ... 0000".

This method can be used to pad messages which are any number of bits long, not necessarily a whole number of bytes long. For example, a message of 23 bits that is padded with 9 bits in order to fill a 32-bit block:

 ... | 1011 1001 1101 0100 0010 011'''1 0000 0000''' |

This padding is the first step of a two-step padding scheme used in many [[hash functions]] including [[MD5]] and [[Secure Hash Algorithm (disambiguation)|SHA]]. In this context, it is specified by [http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1321.html RFC1321] step 3.1.

This padding scheme is defined by [[ISO/IEC 9797-1]] as Padding Method 2.

====Byte padding====

Byte padding can be applied to messages that can be encoded as an integral number of [[byte]]s.

=====ANSI X.923=====

In ANSI X.923 bytes filled with zeros are padded and the last byte defines the padding boundaries or the number of padded bytes.

Example:
In the following example the block size is 8 bytes, and padding is required for 4 bytes (in hexadecimal format)

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD '''00 00 00 04''' |

=====ISO 10126=====

ISO 10126 (withdrawn, 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=18113 ISO catalog, ''ISO 10126-1:1991'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=18114 ISO catalog, ''ISO 10126-2:1991'']&lt;/ref&gt;) specifies that the padding should be done at the end of that last block with random bytes, and the padding boundary should be specified by the last byte.

Example:
In the following example the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD '''81 A6 23 04''' |

=====PKCS#5 and PKCS#7=====
[[PKCS|PKCS#7]] is described in [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652#section-6.3 RFC 5652].

Padding is in whole bytes.  The value of each added byte is the number of bytes that are added, i.e. {{Var|N}} bytes, each of value {{Var|N}} are added.  The number of bytes added will depend on the block boundary to which the message needs to be extended.

The padding will be one of:

 01
 02 02
 03 03 03
 04 04 04 04
 05 05 05 05 05
 06 06 06 06 06 06
 etc.

This padding method (as well as the previous two) is well-defined if and only if {{Var|N}} is less than 256.

Example:
In the following example the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD '''04 04 04 04''' |

If the original data is an integer multiple of {{Var|N}} bytes, then an extra block of bytes with value {{Var|N}} is added. This is necessary so the deciphering algorithm can determine with certainty whether the last byte of the last block is a pad byte indicating the number of padding bytes added or part of the plaintext message. Consider a plaintext message that is an integer multiple of {{Var|N}} bytes with the last byte of plaintext being '''01'''. With no additional information, the deciphering algorithm will not be able to determine whether the last byte is a plaintext byte or a pad byte. However, by adding {{Var|N}} bytes each of value {{Var|N}} after the '''01''' plaintext byte, the deciphering algorithm can always treat the last byte as a pad byte and strip the appropriate number of pad bytes off the end of the ciphertext; said number of bytes to be stripped based on the value of the last byte.

PKCS#5 padding is identical to PKCS#7 padding, except that it has only been defined for block ciphers that use a 64-bit (8-byte) block size. In practice the two can be used interchangeably.

=====ISO/IEC 7816-4=====

[[ISO/IEC 7816]]-4:2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36134 ISO catalog, ''ISO/IEC 7816-4:2005'']&lt;/ref&gt; is identical to the bit padding scheme, applied to a plain text of N bytes. This means in practice that the first byte is a mandatory byte valued '80' (Hexadecimal) followed, if needed, by 0 to N-1 bytes set to '00', until the end of the block is reached. ISO/IEC 7816-4 itself is a communication standard for smart cards containing a file system, and in itself does not contain any cryptographic specifications.

Example:
In the following example the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD '''80 00 00 00''' |

The next example shows a padding of just one byte

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD '''80''' |

====Zero padding====

All the bytes that are required to be padded are padded with zero. The zero padding scheme has not been standardized for encryption,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} although it is specified for hashes and MACs as Padding Method 1 in ISO/IEC 10118-1&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=31143 ISO/IEC 10118-1:2000 ''Information technology – Security techniques – Hash-functions – Part 1: General'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ISO/IEC 9797-1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=30656 ISO/IEC 9797-1:1999 ''Information technology – Security techniques – Message Authentication Codes (MACs) – Part 1: Mechanisms using a block cipher'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Example:
In the following example the block size is 8 bytes and padding is required for 4 bytes

 ... | DD DD DD DD DD DD DD DD | DD DD DD DD '''00 00 00 00''' |

Zero padding may not be reversible if the original file ends with one or more zero bytes, making it impossible to distinguish between plaintext data bytes and padding bytes. It may be used when the length of the message can be derived [[Out-of-band data|out-of-band]]. It is often applied to binary encoded [[String (computer science)|strings]] as the [[null character]] can usually be stripped off as [[Whitespace character|whitespace]].

Zero padding is sometimes also referred to as "null padding" or "zero byte padding". Some implementations may add an additional block of zero bytes if the plaintext is already divisible by the block size.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Public key cryptography==
In [[public key cryptography]], padding is the process of preparing a message for encryption or signing using a specification or scheme such as [[PKCS1|PKCS#1]] v1.5, [[OAEP]], [[Probabilistic signature scheme|PSS]], PSSR, IEEE P1363 EMSA2 and EMSA5.  A modern form of padding for asymmetric primitives is [[Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding|OAEP]] applied to the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA algorithm]], when it is used to encrypt a limited number of bytes.

The operation is referred to as "padding" because originally, random material was simply appended to the message to make it long enough for the primitive. This form of padding is not secure and is therefore no longer applied.  A modern padding scheme aims to ensure that the attacker cannot manipulate the plaintext to exploit the mathematical structure of the primitive and will usually be accompanied by a proof, often in the [[random oracle model]], that breaking the padding scheme is as hard as solving the hard problem underlying the primitive.

==Traffic analysis==

Even if perfect cryptographic routines are used, the attacker can gain knowledge of the amount of traffic that was generated. The attacker might not know what [[Alice and Bob]] were talking about, but can know that they ''were'' talking and ''how much'' they talked. In certain circumstances this can be very bad. Consider for example when a military is organising a secret attack against another nation: it may suffice to alert the other nation for them to know merely that there ''is'' a lot of secret activity going on.

As another example, when encrypting [[VOIP|Voice Over IP]] streams that use variable bit rate encoding, the number of bits per unit of time is not obscured, and this can be exploited to guess spoken phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1880022.1880029|title=Uncovering Spoken Phrases in Encrypted Voice over IP Conversations|first1=Charles V.|last1=Wright|first2=Lucas|last2=Ballard|first3=Scott E.|last3=Coull|first4=Fabian|last4=Monrose|first5=Gerald M.|last5=Masson|date=1 December 2010|publisher=|journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC)|volume=13|issue=4|pages=35|via=dl.acm.org|doi=10.1145/1880022.1880029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Padding messages makes [[traffic analysis]] much harder. Normally, a number of random bits are appended to the end of the message with an indication at the end how much this random data is. The randomness should have a minimum value of 0, a maximum number of N and an even distribution between the two extremes. Note that increasing 0 does not help, only increasing N helps, though that also means that a lower percentage of the channel will be used to transmit real data. Also note that, since the cryptographic routine is assumed to be uncrackable (otherwise the padding length itself is crackable), it does not help to put the padding anywhere else, e.g. at the beginning, in the middle, or in a sporadic manner. For the same reason, padding can be structured (e.g. it can simply be a set of zeros) – though structured padding can be hazard, as explained in [[timing attack]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[topology]], a subset of a [[topological space]] is '''perfect''' if it is [[closed set|closed]] and has no [[isolated point]]s. Equivalently: the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is perfect if  &lt;math&gt;S=S'&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of all [[Limit point|limit points]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, also known as the [[Derived set (mathematics)|derived set]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

In a perfect set, every point can be approximated arbitrarily well by other points from the set: given any point of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and any [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|topological neighborhood]] of the point, there is another point of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that lies within the neighborhood.

Note that the term ''perfect space'' is also used, incompatibly, to refer to other properties of a topological space, such as being a [[G-delta space|G&lt;sub&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/sub&gt; space]]. 

==Examples==

Examples of perfect subsets of the [[Real line|real line]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are: the [[empty set]], all [[Closed interval|closed intervals]], the real line itself, and the [[Cantor set]]. The latter is noteworthy in that it is [[totally disconnected]].

== Connection with other topological properties ==
[[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] proved that every closed subset of the real line can be uniquely written as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a [[countable set]].  This is also true more generally for all closed subsets of [[Polish space|Polish spaces]], in which case the theorem is known as the [[Cantor–Bendixson theorem]].

Cantor also showed that every non-empty perfect subset of the real line has cardinality &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. These results are extended in  [[descriptive set theory]] as follows:
* If ''X'' is a [[complete metric space]] with no isolated points, then the [[Cantor space]] 2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt; can be continuously embedded into ''X''. Thus ''X'' has cardinality at least &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;. If ''X'' is a [[Separable space|separable]], complete metric space with no isolated points, the cardinality of ''X'' is exactly &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.  
* If ''X'' is a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] with no isolated points, there is an injective function (not necessarily continuous) from Cantor space to ''X'', and so ''X'' has cardinality at least &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Pierre de Fermat''' ({{IPA-fr|pjɛːʁ də fɛʁma|lang}}) (Between 31 October and 6 December 1607&lt;ref name="www-gap"/&gt; – 12 January 1665) was a [[French people|French]] lawyer&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=59ITUOLbVkoC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=%22French+lawyer%22+%22Pierre+de+Fermat%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v-jtfjFWWj&amp;sig=h9mle_FEkazDC83rNnAims3rbSY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlj5i8hu_WAhXDWRQKHcyzDZIQ6AEIZzAO#v=onepage&amp;q=%22French%20lawyer&amp;f=false W.E. Burns, The Scientific Revolution: An Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2001, p. 101]&lt;/ref&gt; at the ''[[Parlement]]'' of [[Toulouse]], [[France]], and a [[mathematician]] who is given credit for early developments that led to [[infinitesimal calculus]], including his technique of [[adequality]]. In particular, he is recognized for his discovery of an original method of finding the greatest and the smallest [[ordinate]]s of curved lines, which is analogous to that of [[differential calculus]], then unknown, and his research into [[number theory]]. He made notable contributions to [[analytic geometry]], [[probability]], and [[optics]]. He is best known for his [[Fermat's principle]] for light propagation and his [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] in [[number theory]], which he described in a note at the margin of a copy of [[Diophantus]]' ''[[Arithmetica]]''.

==Biography==
Fermat was born in the first decade of the 17th century in [[Beaumont-de-Lomagne]], France—the late 15th-century mansion where Fermat was born is now a museum. He was from Gascony, where his father, Dominique Fermat, was a wealthy leather merchant, and served three one-year terms as one of the four consuls of Beaumont-de-Lomagne. His mother was  Claire de Long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/when-was-pierre-de-fermat-born|title=When Was Pierre de Fermat Born? {{!}} Mathematical Association of America|website=www.maa.org|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre had one brother and two sisters and was almost certainly brought up in the town of his birth. There is little evidence concerning his school education, but it was probably at the [[Collège de Navarre]] in Montauban.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[File:Capitole Toulouse - Salle Henri-Martin - Buste de Pierre de Fermat.jpg |thumb|Bust in the Salle Henri-Martin in [[Capitole de Toulouse]]]]

He attended the [[University of Orléans]] from 1623 and received a bachelor in civil law in 1626, before moving to [[Bordeaux]]. In Bordeaux he began his first serious mathematical researches, and in 1629 he gave a copy of his restoration of [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]]'s ''[[Apollonius of Perga#De Locis Planis|De Locis Planis]]'' to one of the mathematicians there. Certainly in Bordeaux he was in contact with [[Jean de Beaugrand|Beaugrand]] and during this time he produced important work on [[maxima and minima]] which he gave to [[Étienne d'Espagnet]] who clearly shared mathematical interests with Fermat. There he became much influenced by the work of [[François Viète]].

In 1630, he bought the office of a [[councillor]] at the [[Parlement de Toulouse]], one of the High Courts of Judicature in France, and was sworn in by the Grand Chambre in May 1631. He held this office for the rest of his life. Fermat thereby became entitled to change his name from Pierre Fermat to Pierre de Fermat. Fluent in six languages (French, Latin, Occitan, classical Greek, Italian and Spanish), Fermat was praised for his written verse in several languages and his advice was eagerly sought regarding the emendation of Greek texts.

He communicated most of his work in letters to friends, often with little or no proof of his theorems. In some of these letters to his friends he explored many of the fundamental ideas of calculus before [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] or [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Fermat was a trained lawyer making mathematics more of a hobby than a profession. Nevertheless, he made important contributions to analytical geometry, probability, number theory and calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential Calculus Early Transcendental Functions|last=Larson, Hostetler, Edwards|first=|publisher=Richard Stratton|year=2008|isbn=978-0-618-87918-2|location=U.S.A|pages=159|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secrecy was common in European mathematical circles at the time. This naturally led to priority disputes with contemporaries such as [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[John Wallis|Wallis]].&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ball | first = Walter William Rouse | title = A short account of the history of mathematics | publisher = General Books LLC | year = 1888 | isbn = 978-1-4432-9487-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anders Hald]] writes that, "The basis of Fermat's mathematics was the classical Greek treatises combined with Vieta's [[new algebra]]ic methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Faltings | first = Gerd | authorlink = Gerd Faltings | issue = 7 | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] | mr = 1335426 | pages = 743–746 | title = The proof of Fermat's last theorem by R.

===Work===
Fermat's pioneering work in [[analytic geometry]] (''Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam et de tangentibus linearum curvarum'') was circulated in manuscript form in 1636 (based on results achieved in 1629),&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber, Michael Ayers (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-century Philosophy, Volume 2'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 754 n. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; predating the publication of Descartes' famous ''[[La Géométrie|La géométrie]]'' (1637), which exploited the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-de-Fermat|title=Pierre de Fermat {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This manuscript was published posthumously in 1679 in ''Varia opera mathematica'', as ''Ad Locos Planos et Solidos Isagoge'' (''Introduction to Plane and Solid Loci'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gullberg|Gullberg, Jan]]. ''Mathematics from the birth of numbers'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company; p. 548. {{isbn|0-393-04002-X}} {{isbn|978-0393040029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam'' and in ''De tangentibus linearum curvarum'', Fermat developed a method ([[adequality]]) for determining maxima, minima, and [[tangent]]s to various curves that was equivalent to [[differential calculus]].&lt;ref name=Pellegrino&gt;{{cite web | last = Pellegrino | first = Dana | title=Pierre de Fermat | url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~cherlin/History/Papers2000/pellegrino.html| accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Florian Cajori]], "Who was the First Inventor of Calculus" The American Mathematical Monthly (1919) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5wxLAAAAYAAJ Vol.26]&lt;/ref&gt; In these works, Fermat obtained a technique for finding the centers of gravity of various plane and solid figures, which led to his further work in [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]].

[[File:Pierre de Fermat.png|thumb|left|upright|Pierre de Fermat]]
Fermat was the first person known to have evaluated the integral of general power functions. With his method, he was able to reduce this evaluation to the sum of [[geometric series]].&lt;ref name=quadrature&gt;{{citation | last1 = Paradís | first1 = Jaume | last2 = Pla | first2 = Josep | last3 = Viader | first3 = Pelegrí | issue = 1 | journal = Revue d'Histoire des Mathématiques | mr = 2493381 | pages = 5–51 | title = Fermat's method of quadrature | url = https://www.numdam.org/item/RHM_2008__14_1_5_0 | volume = 14 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting formula was helpful to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and then [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], when they independently developed the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

In number theory, Fermat studied [[Pell's equation]], [[perfect number]]s, [[amicable number]]s and what would later become [[Fermat numbers]]. It was while researching perfect numbers that he discovered [[Fermat's little theorem]]. He invented a factorization method—[[Fermat's factorization method]]—as well as the proof technique of [[infinite descent]], which he used to prove [[Fermat's right triangle theorem]] which includes as a corollary Fermat's Last Theorem for the case ''n'' = 4. Fermat developed the [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares|two-square theorem]], and the [[Fermat polygonal number theorem|polygonal number theorem]], which states that each number is a sum of three [[triangular number]]s, [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|four square numbers]], five [[pentagonal number]]s, and so on.

Although Fermat claimed to have proven all his arithmetic theorems, few records of his proofs have survived. Many mathematicians, including [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], doubted several of his claims, especially given the difficulty of some of the problems and the limited mathematical methods available to Fermat. His famous [[Fermat's Last Theorem|Last Theorem]] was first discovered by his son in the margin in his father's copy of an edition of [[Diophantus]], and included the statement that the margin was too small to include the proof. It seems that he had not written to [[Marin Mersenne]] about it. It was first proven in 1994, by [[Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|Sir Andrew Wiles]], using techniques unavailable to Fermat.

Although he carefully studied and drew inspiration from Diophantus, Fermat began a different tradition. Diophantus was content to find a single solution to his equations, even if it were an undesired fractional one. Fermat was interested only in integer solutions to his [[Diophantine equation]]s, and he looked for all possible general solutions. He often proved that certain equations had [[Empty set|no solution]], which usually baffled his contemporaries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Through their correspondence in 1654, Fermat and [[Blaise Pascal]] helped lay the foundation for the theory of probability. From this brief but productive collaboration on the [[problem of points]], they are now regarded as joint founders of [[probability theory]].&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;{{cite web | last1 = O'Connor | first1 = J.

In it, he was asked by a professional [[gambler]] why if he bet on rolling at least one six in four throws of a die he won in the long term, whereas betting on throwing at least one double-six in 24 throws of two [[dice]] resulted in his losing. Fermat showed mathematically why this was the case.&lt;ref&gt;Eves, Howard. ''An Introduction to the History of Mathematics'', Saunders College Publishing, Fort Worth, Texas, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[History of variational principles in physics|variational principle]] in [[physics]] was articulated by [[Euclid]] in his ''Catoptrica''. It says that, for the path of light reflecting from a mirror, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] equals the [[angle of reflection]]. [[Hero of Alexandria]] later showed that this path gave the shortest length and the least time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1972|pages= 167–168|isbn=0-19-501496-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermat refined and generalized this to "light travels between two given points along the path of shortest ''time''" now known as the ''[[principle of least time]]''.&lt;ref name=variational&gt;{{cite web |title=Fermat's principle for light rays | url=http://relativity.livingreviews.org/open?pubNo=lrr-2004-9&amp;page=articlesu9.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235551/http://relativity.livingreviews.org/open?pubNo=lrr-2004-9&amp;page=articlesu9.html | archivedate=March 3, 2016| accessdate=2008-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this, Fermat is recognized as a key figure in the historical development of the fundamental [[principle of least action]] in physics.

Pierre de Fermat died on January 12, 1665 at [[Castres]], in the present-day department of [[Tarn (department)|Tarn]].&lt;ref name=barner&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=14213014 Klaus Barner (2001): ''How old did Fermat become?''] Internationale Zeitschrift für Geschichte und Ethik der Naturwissenschaften, Technik und Medizin. {{issn|0036-6978}}.

French sculptor [[Théophile Barrau]] made a marble statue named ''Hommage à Pierre Fermat'' as a tribute to Fermat, now at the [[Capitole de Toulouse]].

==Assessment of his work==
[[File:Fermats will.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Holographic will]] handwritten by Fermat on 4 March 1660 — kept at the Departmental Archives of [[Haute-Garonne]], in [[Toulouse]]]]
Together with [[René Descartes]], Fermat was one of the two leading mathematicians of the first half of the 17th century. According to [[Peter L. Bernstein]], in his book ''Against the Gods'', Fermat "was a mathematician of rare power. He was an independent inventor of [[analytic geometry]], he contributed to the early development of calculus, he did research on the weight of the earth, and he worked on light refraction and optics. In the course of what turned out to be an extended correspondence with Pascal, he made a significant contribution to the theory of probability. But Fermat's crowning achievement was in the theory of numbers."&lt;ref name=Bernstein&gt;{{cite book | last = Bernstein | first = Peter L.|title= Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year = 1996 | pages = 61–62 | isbn = 978-0-471-12104-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Fermat's work in analysis, [[Isaac Newton]] wrote that his own early ideas about calculus came directly from "Fermat's way of drawing tangents."&lt;ref name=Simmons&gt;{{cite book | last = Simmons | first = George F.|title= Calculus Gems: Brief Lives and Memorable Mathematics | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | year = 2007 | page = 98 | isbn = 0-88385-561-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Fermat's number theoretic work, the 20th-century mathematician [[André Weil]] wrote that: "what we possess of his methods for dealing with [[Algebraic curve|curves]] of [[Elliptic curve|genus 1]] is remarkably coherent; it is still the foundation for the modern theory of such curves. It naturally falls into two parts; the first one ... may conveniently be termed a method of ascent, in contrast with the [[infinite descent|descent]] which is rightly regarded as Fermat's own."&lt;ref&gt;Weil 1984, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Fermat's use of ascent, Weil continued: "The novelty consisted in the vastly extended use which Fermat made of it, giving him at least a partial equivalent of what we would obtain by the systematic use of the [[Group theory|group theoretical]] properties of the [[rational point]]s on a standard cubic."&lt;ref&gt;Weil 1984, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; With his gift for number relations and his ability to find proofs for many of his theorems, Fermat essentially created the modern theory of numbers.

[[Image:Visualisation 1 billion.svg|thumb|480px|Visualisation of powers of 10 from one to 1 billion.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''power of 10''' is any of the [[integer]] [[exponentiation|powers]] of the number [[10 (number)|ten]]; in other words, ten [[multiplication|multiplied]] by itself a certain number of times (when the power is a positive integer). By definition, the number one is a power (the zeroth power) of ten. The first few non-negative powers of ten are:

:[[1]], [[10]], [[100 (number)|100]], [[1,000]], [[10,000]], [[100,000]], [[1,000,000]], [[10,000,000]]. ... {{OEIS|A011557}}

==Positive powers==
In [[decimal]] notation the ''n''th power of ten is written as '1' followed by ''n'' zeroes. It can also be written as 10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; or as 1E''n'' in [[E notation]]. See [[order of magnitude]] and [[orders of magnitude (numbers)]] for named powers of ten. There are two conventions for naming positive powers of ten, called the [[long and short scales]]. Where a power of ten has different names in the two conventions, the long scale name is shown in brackets. 

The positive 10 power related to a short scale name can be determined based on its Latin name-prefix using the following formula:
10&lt;sup&gt; [(prefix-number + 1) × 3]&lt;/sup&gt;

Examples:   Billion = 10&lt;sup&gt; [(2 + 1) × 3]&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt; 9&lt;/sup&gt;  ;        Octillion = 10&lt;sup&gt; [(8 + 1) × 3]&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt; 27&lt;/sup&gt;

==Negative powers==

The sequence of powers of ten can also be extended to negative powers.

Similarly to above, the negative 10 power related to a short scale name can be determined based on its Latin name-prefix using the following formula:
10&lt;sup&gt; -[(prefix-number + 1) × 3]&lt;/sup&gt;

Examples:   billionth = 10&lt;sup&gt; -[(2 + 1) × 3]&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt; -9&lt;/sup&gt;  ;        quintillionth = 10&lt;sup&gt; -[(5 + 1) × 3]&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt; -18&lt;/sup&gt;

== Googol ==
{{Main|googol}}

The number googol is 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;. The term was coined by 9-year-old Milton Sirotta, nephew of American mathematician [[Edward Kasner]], popularized in his 1940 book ''[[Mathematics and the Imagination]]'', it was used to compare and illustrate very large numbers. [[Googolplex]], a much larger power of ten (10 to the googol power, or 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), was also introduced in that book.

==Scientific notation==
{{Main|Scientific notation}}

Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers of very large and very small sizes compactly when precision is less important.

A number written in scientific notation has a [[significand]] (sometime called a mantissa) multiplied by a power of ten.

Sometimes written in the form:

: ''m''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;

Or more compactly as:

: 10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;

This is generally used to denote powers of 10.  Where ''n'' is positive, this indicates the number zeros after the number, and where the ''n'' is negative, this indicates the number of decimal places before the number.

As an example:

: 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 100,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathsteacher.com.au/year7/ch02_power/08_pow10/pow.htm mathsteacher.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;
: 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.00001&lt;ref&gt;[http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/sftheory/power10.htm nasa.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;''' 

The notation of ''m''E''n'', known as ''[[E notation]]'', is used in computer programming, spreadsheets and databases, but is not used in scientific papers.

Starting at a picnic by the lakeside in Chicago, this film transports the viewer to the outer edges of the universe. Every ten seconds we view the starting point from ten times farther out until our own galaxy is visible only as a speck of light among many others. Returning to Earth with breathtaking speed, we move inward - into the hand of the sleeping picnicker - with ten times more magnification every ten seconds. Our journey ends inside a proton of a carbon atom within a DNA molecule in a white blood cell."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22565">In [[classical mechanics]], the '''shell theorem''' gives gravitational simplifications that can be applied to objects inside or outside a spherically [[symmetry|symmetrical]] body. This theorem has particular application to [[astronomy]].

[[Isaac Newton]] proved the shell theorem&lt;ref name="Newton philo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|date=1687|location=London|pages=Theorem XXXI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that:
# A [[sphere|spherically]] [[symmetry|symmetric]] body affects external objects gravitationally as though all of its [[mass]] were concentrated at a [[point mass|point]] at its centre.
# If the body is a spherically symmetric shell (i.e., a hollow ball), no net [[gravitational force]] is exerted by the shell on any object inside, regardless of the object's location within the shell.

A corollary is that inside a solid sphere of constant density, the gravitational force within the object varies linearly with distance from the centre, becoming zero by symmetry at the centre of mass. This can be seen as follows: take a point within such a sphere, at a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the centre of the sphere. Then you can ignore all the shells of greater radius, according to the shell theorem. So, the remaining mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;r^3&lt;/math&gt; (because it is based on volume), and the gravitational force exerted on it is proportional to &lt;math&gt;m/r^2&lt;/math&gt; (the [[inverse square law]]), so the overall gravitational effect is proportional to &lt;math&gt;r^3/r^2 =r&lt;/math&gt;, so is linear in &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

These results were important to Newton's analysis of planetary motion; they are not immediately obvious, but they can be proven with [[calculus]]. (Alternatively, [[Gauss's law for gravity]] offers a much simpler way to prove the same results.)

In addition to gravity, the shell theorem can also be used to describe the [[electric field]] generated by a static spherically symmetric [[charge density]], or similarly for any other phenomenon that follows an [[inverse square law]]. The derivations below focus on gravity, but the results can easily be generalized to the [[electrostatic force]]. Moreover, the results can be generalized to the case of general ellipsoidal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv

== Outside a shell ==
A solid, [[sphere|spherically]] [[symmetry|symmetric]] body can be modelled as an infinite number of [[concentric]], infinitesimally thin spherical shells. If one of these shells can be treated as a point mass, then a system of shells (i.e. the sphere) can also be treated as a point mass. Consider one such shell (the diagram shows a cross-section):

[[File:shell-diag-1.svg|center|500px]]

(Note: {{math|''d''{{var|θ}}}} appearing in the diagram refers to the small angle, not the [[arclength]]. The arclength is {{math|{{var|R}} ''d''{{var|θ}}}}.)

Applying [[Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation]], the sum of the forces due to mass elements in the shaded band is

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;dF = \frac{Gm \;dM}{s^2}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

However, since there is partial cancellation due to the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] nature of the force in conjunction with the circular band's symmetry, the leftover [[Vector (geometry)#Vector components|component]] (in the direction pointing toward ''m'') is given by

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;dF_r = \frac{Gm \;dM}{s^2} \cos\phi.&lt;/math&gt;}}

The total force on ''m'', then, is simply the sum of the force exerted by all the bands. By shrinking the width of each band, and increasing the number of bands, the sum becomes an integral expression:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \int dF_r&lt;/math&gt;}}

Since ''G'' and ''m'' are constants, they may be taken out of the integral:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = Gm \int \frac{dM \cos\phi} {s^2}. &lt;/math&gt;}}

To evaluate this integral, one must first express ''dM'' as a function of ''dθ''

The total surface of a spherical shell is
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;4\pi R^2 &lt;/math&gt;}}
while the surface of the thin slice between ''θ'' and ''θ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''dθ'' is
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;2\pi R^2\sin\theta \,d\theta &lt;/math&gt;}}

If the mass of the shell is ''M'', one therefore has that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;dM = \frac {2\pi R^2\sin\theta }{4\pi R^2} M\,d\theta = \textstyle\frac{1}{2} M\sin\theta \,d\theta&lt;/math&gt;}}

and

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \frac{GMm}{2} \int \frac{\sin\theta \cos\phi} {s^2}\,d\theta &lt;/math&gt;}}

By the [[law of cosines]],

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\cos\phi = \frac{r^2 + s^2 - R^2}{2rs}&lt;/math&gt;}}

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta = \frac{r^2 + R^2 - s^2}{2rR}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

These two relations link the three parameters ''θ'', ''ϕ'' and ''s'' that appear in the integral together. When ''θ'' increases from 0 to π radians, ''ϕ'' varies from the initial value 0 to a maximal value to finally return to zero for&amp;nbsp;''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;π. ''s'' on the other hand increases from the initial value ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''R'' to the final value ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''R'' when ''θ'' increases from 0 to π radians. 
This is illustrated in the following animation:

[[File:Shell-diag-1-anim.gif|center]]

(Note: As viewed from ''m'', the shaded blue band appears as a thin [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] whose inner and outer diameters converge to ''R'' sin ''θ'' as ''dθ'' vanishes.)

To find a [[primitive function]] to the integrand, one has to make ''s'' the independent integration variable instead of ''θ''.

Performing an [[implicit differentiation]] of the second of the "cosine law" expressions above yields

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta \;d\theta = \frac{s}{rR} ds.&lt;/math&gt;}}

and one gets that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \frac{GMm}{2rR} \int \frac{\cos\phi} {s}\,ds &lt;/math&gt;}}

where the new integration variable ''s'' increases from ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''R'' to&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''R''.

Inserting the expression for cos(''φ'') using the first of the "cosine law" expressions
above, one finally gets that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \frac{GMm}{4r^2 R} \int \left( 1 + \frac{r^2 - R^2}{s^2} \right) \, ds.&lt;/math&gt;}}

A [[primitive function]] to the integrand is

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;s - \frac{r^2 - R^2}{s}&lt;/math&gt;}}

and inserting the bounds ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''R'', ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''R'' for the integration variable ''s'' in this primitive function, one gets that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \frac{GMm}{r^2},&lt;/math&gt;}}

saying that the gravitational force is the same as that of a point mass in the centre of the shell with the same mass.

Finally, integrate all infinitesimally thin spherical shell with mass of ''dM'', and we can obtain the total gravity contribution of a solid ball to the object outside the ball

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_{total} = \int dF_r = \frac{Gm}{r^2} \int dM.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Between the radius of ''x'' to ''x'' + ''dx'', ''dM'' can be expressed as a function of ''x'', i.e.,

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;dM = \frac{4 \pi x^2 dx}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3} M = \frac{3Mx^2 dx}{R^3}&lt;/math&gt;}}

Therefore, the total gravity is

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_{total} = \frac{3GMm}{r^2 R^3} \int_{0}^{R} x^2 dx = \frac{GMm}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;}}

which suggests that the gravity of a solid spherical ball to an exterior object can be simplified as that of a point mass in the centre of the ball with the same mass.

== Inside a shell ==
For a point inside the shell, the difference is that when ''θ'' is equal to zero, ''ϕ'' takes the value π radians and ''s'' the value ''R'' - ''r''. When ''θ'' increases from 0 to
π radians, ''ϕ'' decreases from the initial value π radians to zero and ''s'' increases from the initial value ''R'' - ''r'' to the value ''R'' + ''r''.

This can all be seen in the following figure
[[File:shell-diag-2.svg|center|240px]]

Inserting these bounds into the [[primitive function]]

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;s - \frac{r^2 - R^2}{s}&lt;/math&gt;}}

one gets that, in this case

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = 0 &lt;/math&gt;}}

saying that the net gravitational forces acting on the point mass from the mass elements of the shell, outside the measurement point, cancel out.

'''Generalization:''' If &lt;math&gt;f=k / r^p&lt;/math&gt;, the resultant force inside the shell is:
 
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F(r) = \frac{GMm}{4r^2 R} \int_{R-r}^{R+r} \left( \frac{1}{s^{p-2}} + \frac{r^2 - R^2}{s^p} \right) \, ds&lt;/math&gt;}}

The above results into &lt;math&gt;F(r)&lt;/math&gt; being identically zero if and only if &lt;math&gt;p=2&lt;/math&gt;

Outside the shell (i.e. r&gt;R or r&lt;-R):

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F(r) = \frac{GMm}{4r^2 R} \int_{r-R}^{r+R} \left( \frac{1}{s^{p-2}} + \frac{r^2 - R^2}{s^p} \right) \, ds&lt;/math&gt;}}

== Derivation using Gauss's law ==
The shell theorem is an immediate consequence of [[Gauss's law for gravity]] saying that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_S {\mathbf g}\cdot \,d{\mathbf {S}} = -4 \pi GM&lt;/math&gt;}}

where ''M'' is the mass of the part of the spherically symmetric mass distribution that is inside the sphere with radius ''r'' and

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_S {\mathbf g}\cdot \,d{\mathbf {S}} = \int_S {\mathbf g}\cdot {\mathbf{\hat n}}\,dS&lt;/math&gt;}}
is the [[surface integral]] of the [[gravitational field]] '''g''' over any [[closed surface]] inside which the total mass is ''M'', the [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{ \hat n}&lt;/math&gt; being the outward normal to the surface.

The gravitational field of a spherically symmetric mass distribution like a mass point, a spherical shell or a homogenous sphere must also be spherically symmetric. If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ \hat n}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the direction from the point of symmetry to another point the gravitational field at this other point must therefore be

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; \mathbf g = g(r)\mathbf{ \hat n }&lt;/math&gt;}}

where ''g''(''r'') only depends on the distance ''r'' to the point of symmetry

Selecting the closed surface as a sphere with radius ''r'' with center at the point of symmetry the outward normal to a point on the surface, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{ \hat n }&lt;/math&gt;, is precisely the direction pointing away from the point of symmetry of the mass distribution.

One, therefore, has that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {g} = g(r)\mathbf{ \hat n }&lt;/math&gt;}}

and

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;\int_S \mathbf g \cdot \,d{\mathbf {S}} = g(r) \int_S \,d{S} = g(r) 4\pi r^2 &lt;/math&gt;}}

as the area of the sphere is 4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

From Gauss's law it then follows that
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; g(r) 4\pi r^2 = -4 \pi GM &lt;/math&gt;}}

i.e. that
{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; g(r) = -\frac {GM}{r^2}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

== Converses and generalizations ==

It is natural to ask whether the [[Theorem#Converse|converse]] of the shell theorem is true, namely whether the result of the theorem implies the law of universal gravitation, or if there is some more general force law for which the theorem holds. More specifically, one may ask the question:

{{block indent|Suppose there is a force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; between masses ''M'' and ''m'', separated by a distance ''r'' of the form &lt;math&gt;F = M m f(r)&lt;/math&gt; such that any spherically symmetric body affects external bodies as if its mass were concentrated at its centre. Then what form can the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; take?}}

In fact, this allows exactly one more class of force than the (Newtonian) inverse square.&lt;ref name=Gurzadyan&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gurzadyan |first=Vahe |authorlink=vahe Gurzadyan|title=The cosmological constant in McCrea-Milne cosmological scheme|journal=The Observatory|date= 1985|volume=105|pages=42–43|bibcode=1985Obs...105...42G}} http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1985Obs...105...42G&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arens&gt;{{cite journal| last=Arens| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Friederich Arens|title=Newton's observations about the field of a uniform thin spherical shell|journal=Note di Matematica|date=January 1, 1990|volume=X|issue=Suppl. n. 1|pages=39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most general force as derived in &lt;ref name="Gurzadyan"/&gt; is:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; F = -\frac{G M m}{r^2} - \frac{\Lambda M m r}{3} &lt;/math&gt;}}

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; can be constants taking any value. The first term is the familiar law of universal gravitation; the second is an additional force, analogous to the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[general relativity]].

If we further constrain the force by requiring that the second part of the theorem also holds, namely that there is no force inside a hollow ball, we exclude the possibility of the additional term, and the inverse square law is indeed the unique force law satisfying the theorem.

On the other hand, if we relax the conditions, and require only that the field everywhere outside a spherically symmetric body is the same as the field from some point mass at the centre (of any mass), we allow a new class of solutions given by the [[Yukawa potential]], of which the inverse square law is a special case.

Another generalization can be made for a disc by observing that 

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;dM=\frac{R^2}{2} \frac{d\theta \sin^2{\theta}}{\pi R^2}M=\frac{ \sin^2{\theta}}{2 \pi}M d\theta &lt;/math&gt;}}

so:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F_r = \frac{GMm}{2 \pi} \int \frac{ \sin^2{\theta} \cos\phi} {s^2}d\theta,&lt;/math&gt;}}

where &lt;math&gt;M=\pi R^2 \rho.&lt;/math&gt;

Doing all the intermediate calculations we get:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;F(r) = \frac{Gm \rho}{8r^3} \int_{R-r}^{R+r} { \frac{(r^2+s^2-R^2)\sqrt{2(r^2R^2+r^2s^2+R^2s^2)-s^4-r^4-R^4}}{s^2} } \, ds&lt;/math&gt;}}

Note that &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; in this example is expressed in &lt;math&gt;\frac{kg}{m^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Newton's proofs ==

=== Introduction ===

Propositions 70 and 71 consider the force acting on a particle from a hollow sphere with an infinitesimally thin surface, whose mass density is constant over the surface. The force on the particle from a small area of the surface of the sphere is proportional to the mass of the area and inversely as the square of its distance from the particle. The first proposition considers the case when the particle is inside the sphere, the second when it is outside. The use of infinitesimals and limiting processes in geometrical constructions are simple and elegant and avoid the need for any integrations. They well illustrate Newton's method of proving many of the propositions in the ''Principia''.	

His proof of Propositions 70 is trivial. In the following, it is considered in slightly greater detail than Newton provides.

The proof of Proposition 71 is more historically significant. It forms the first part of his proof that the gravitational force of a solid sphere acting on a particle outside it is inversely proportional to the square of its distance from the centre of the sphere, provided the density at any point inside the sphere is a function only of its distance from the centre of the sphere.

Although the following are completely faithful to Newton's proofs, very minor changes have been made to attempt to make them clearer.

=== Force on a point inside a hollow sphere ===

[[File:Attraction Interior Sphere.png|Attraction interior sphere]]

Fig. 2 is a cross-section of the hollow sphere through the centre, S and an arbitrary point, P, inside the sphere. Through P draw two lines IL and HK such that the angle KPL is very small. JM is the line through P that bisects that angle. From the geometry of circles, the triangles IPH and KPL are similar. 
The lines KH and IL are rotated about the axis JM to form 2 cones that intersect the sphere in 2 closed curves. In Fig. 1 the sphere is seen from a distance along the line PE and is assumed transparent so both curves can be seen. 

The surface of the sphere that the cones intersect can be considered to be flat, and angles &lt;math&gt; PJI = PMK &lt;/math&gt;

Since the intersection of a cone with a plane is an ellipse, in this case the intersections form two ellipses with major axes IH and KL, where &lt;math&gt; \frac{IH}{KL} = \frac{PJ}{PM} &lt;/math&gt;

By a similar argument, the minor axes are in the same ratio. This is clear if the sphere is viewed from above. Therefore the two ellipses are similar, so their areas are as the squares of their major axes. As the mass of any section of the surface is proportional to the area of that section, for the 2 elliptical areas the ratios of their masses &lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{PJ^2}{PM^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Since the force of attraction on P in the direction JM from either of the elliptic areas, is direct as the mass of the area and inversely as the square of its distance from P, it is independent of the distance of P from the sphere. Hence, the forces on P from the 2 infinitesimal elliptical areas are equal and opposite and there is no net force in the direction JM.  

As the position of P and the direction of JM are both arbitrary, it follows that any particle inside a hollow sphere experiences no net force from the mass of the sphere.

Note: Newton simply describes the arcs IH and KL as 'minimally small' and the areas traced out by the lines IL and HK can be any shape, not necessarily elliptic, but they will always be similar.

=== Force on a point outside a hollow sphere ===

[[File:Attraction Exterior Sphere.png|Attraction exterior sphere]]

Fig. 1 is a cross-section of the hollow sphere through the centre, S with an arbitrary point, P, outside the sphere. PT is the tangent to the circle at T which passes through P. HI is a small arc on the surface such that PH is less than PT. Extend PI to intersect the sphere at L and draw SF to the point F that bisects IL. Extend PH to intersect the sphere at K and draw SE to the point E that bisects HK, and extend SF to intersect HK at D. Drop a perpendicular IQ on to the line PS joining P to the centre S. Let the radius of the sphere be a and the distance PS be D.

Let arc IH be extended perpendicularly out of the plane of the diagram, by a small distance ζ. The area of the figure generated is IH.ζ, and its mass is proportional to this product.

The force due to this mass on the particle at P &lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{IH.\zeta}{PI^2} &lt;/math&gt; and is along the line PI. 

The component of this force towards the centre &lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{IH.\zeta.PQ}{PI^3} &lt;/math&gt;.

If now the arc HI is rotated completely about the line PS to form a ring of width HI and radius IQ, the length of the ring is 2π.IQ and its area is 2π.IQ.IH. The component of the force due to this ring on the particle at P in the direction PS becomes &lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{IH.IQ.PQ}{PI^3} &lt;/math&gt;.

The perpendicular components of the force directed towards PS cancel out since the mass in the ring is distributed symmetrically about PS. Therefore, the component in the direction PS is the total force on P due to the ring formed by rotating arc HI about PS.

From similar triangles: &lt;math&gt; \frac{IQ}{PI} = \frac{FS}{D}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; \frac{PQ}{PI} = \frac{PF}{D}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \frac{RI}{PI} = \frac{DF}{PF}&lt;/math&gt;

If HI is sufficiently small that it can be taken as a straight line, SIH is a right angle, and the angles &lt;math&gt; RIH = FIS &lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt; \frac{HI}{RI} = \frac{a}{IF}&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence the force on P due to the ring &lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{IH.IQ.PQ}{PI^3} = \frac{a.DF.FS.PF}{IF.PF.D.D} = \frac{a.DF.FS}{IF.D^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Assume now in Fig. 2 that another particle is outside the sphere at a point, p, a different distance, d, from the centre of the sphere, with corresponding points lettered in lower case. For easy comparison, the construction of P in Fig. 1 is also shown in Fig. 2. As before, ph is less than pt.

Generate a ring with width ih and radius iq by making angle &lt;math&gt; fiS = FIS &lt;/math&gt; and the slightly larger Angle &lt;math&gt; dhS = DHS &lt;/math&gt;, so that the distance PS is subtended by the same angle at I as is pS at i. The same holds for H and h, respectively.

The total force on p due to this ring is 

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; \propto \frac{ih.iq.pq}{pi^3} = \frac{a.df.fS}{if.d^2} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Clearly &lt;math&gt; fS = FS &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; if = IF &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; eS = ES &lt;/math&gt;.

Newton claims that DF and df can be taken as equal in the limit as the angles DPF and dpf 'vanish together'. Note that angles DPF and dpf are not equal. Although DS and dS become equal in the limit, this does not imply that the ratio of DF to df becomes equal to unity, when DF and df both approach zero. In the finite case DF depends on D, and df on d, so they are not equal.
 
Since the ratio of DF to df in the limit is crucial, more detailed analysis is required. From the similar right triangles, &lt;math&gt; \frac {DF}{PF} = \frac{ED}{ES}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; ED^2 = (DF + FS)^2 - ES^2 &lt;/math&gt;, giving &lt;math&gt; \frac {(PF^2 - ES^2)DF^2}{PF^2} +  2.FS.DF + FS^2 - ES^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Solving the quadratic for DF, in the limit as ES approaches FS, the smaller root, &lt;math&gt; DF = ES - FS &lt;/math&gt;. More simply, as DF approaches zero, in the limit the &lt;math&gt; DF^2 &lt;/math&gt; term can be ignored: &lt;math&gt; 2.FS.DF + FS^2 - ES^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; leading to the same result. Clearly df has the same limit, justifying Newton’s claim.

Comparing the force from the ring HI rotated about PS to the ring hi about pS, the ratio of these 2 forces equals &lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2}{D^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

By dividing up the arcs AT and Bt into corresponding infinitesimal rings, it follows that the ratio of the force due to the arc AT rotated about PS to that of Bt rotated about pS is in the same ratio, and similarly, the ratio of the forces due to arc TB to that of tA both rotated are in the same ratio.

Therefore, the force on a particle any distance D from the centre of the hollow sphere is inversely proportional to &lt;math&gt; D^2 &lt;/math&gt;, which proves the proposition.

== Shell theorem in general relativity ==
There is an analog of the shell theorem in general relativity (GR). The shell theorem shows that the gravitational potential outside a spherically symmetric body is given by -GM/r—whether or not the body is changing with time. In general relativity, there is a similar theorem that demonstrating that the spacetime geometry ''outside'' a spherically symmetric mass-energy distribution is the time-independent Schwarzschild geometry—even if the central mass is undergoing gravitational collapse (Misner et al. 1973). 

This equivalent of the shell theorem in GR is very useful because it allows to use the machinery of the Schwarzschild metric to understand the gravitational collapse leading to a black hole, and its effect on the motion of light-rays and particles outside and inside the event horizon (Hartle 2003, chapter 12).

[[File:Nuvola apps edu mathematics blue-p.svg|thumb|right|168px|The mathematical expression "The (principal) square root of x"]]
[[Image:Five Squared.svg|thumb|right|168px&lt;!-- at 160px and 200px lines render with unequal widths --&gt;|For example, {{math|{{sqrt|25}} {{=}} 5}}, since {{math|25 {{=}} 5&amp;sdot;5}}, or {{math|5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (5 squared).]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''square root''' of a number ''a'' is a number ''y'' such that {{nowrap|1=''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''}}; in other words, a number ''y'' whose ''[[square (algebra)|square]]'' (the result of multiplying the number by itself, or {{nowrap|''y''&amp;sdot;''y''}}) is ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;Gel'fand, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9z7iliyFD0C&amp;pg=PA120 p. 120] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902151740/https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9z7iliyFD0C&amp;pg=PA120 |date=2016-09-02 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 4 and −4 are square roots of 16 because {{nowrap|1=4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (−4)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 16}}.
Every nonnegative [[real number]] ''a'' has a unique nonnegative square root, called the ''principal square root'', which is denoted by {{sqrt|''a''}}, where √ is called the ''[[radical sign]]'' or ''radix''. For example, the principal square root of 9 is 3, which is denoted by {{sqrt|9}} = 3, because {{nowrap|1=3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 3 • 3 = 9}} and 3 is nonnegative.  The term (or number) whose square root is being considered is known as the ''radicand''. The radicand is the number or expression underneath the radical sign, in this example 9.

Every [[positive number]] ''a'' has two square roots: {{sqrt|''a''}}, which is positive, and −{{sqrt|''a''}}, which is negative. Together, these two roots are denoted as ±{{sqrt|''a''}} (see [[Plus-minus_sign|±&amp;nbsp;shorthand]]). Although the principal square root of a positive number is only one of its two square roots, the designation "''the'' square root" is often used to refer to the ''principal square root''. For positive ''a'', the principal square root can also be written in [[Exponentiation|exponent]] notation, as ''a''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A First Course in Complex Analysis With Applications |edition=2nd |first1=Dennis G. |last1=Zill |first2=Patrick |last2=Shanahan |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2008 |isbn=0-7637-5772-1 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKZqY8PCNo0C |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901081936/https://books.google.com/books?id=YKZqY8PCNo0C |archivedate=2016-09-01 |df= }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=YKZqY8PCNo0C&amp;pg=PA78 Extract of page 78] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901091148/https://books.google.com/books?id=YKZqY8PCNo0C&amp;pg=PA78 |date=2016-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Square roots of negative numbers can be discussed within the framework of [[complex number]]s. More generally, square roots can be considered in any context in which a notion of "squaring" of some mathematical objects is defined (including [[Matrix (mathematics)|algebras of matrices]], [[endomorphism ring]]s, etc.)

==History==
The [[Yale Babylonian Collection]] [[YBC&amp;nbsp;7289]] clay tablet was created between 1800&amp;nbsp;BC and 1600&amp;nbsp;BC, showing {{sqrt|2}} and {{sqrt|2}}/2 = 1/{{sqrt|2}}  as 1;24,51,10 and 0;42,25,35 [[Sexagesimal |base 60]] numbers on a square crossed by two diagonals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/Euclid/ybc/analysis.html|title=Analysis of YBC 7289|work=ubc.ca|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1;24,51,10) base 60 corresponds to 1.41421296 which is a correct value to 5 decimal points (1.41421356...).

The [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] is a copy from 1650&amp;nbsp;BC of an earlier [[Berlin Papyrus 6619|Berlin Papyrus]] and other texts{{snd}}possibly the [[Kahun Papyrus]]{{snd}}that shows how the Egyptians extracted square roots by an inverse proportion method.&lt;ref&gt;Anglin, W.S. (1994). ''Mathematics: A Concise History and Philosophy''. New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[History of India|Ancient India]], the knowledge of theoretical and applied aspects of square and square root was at least as old as the ''[[Sulba Sutras]]'', dated around 800–500&amp;nbsp;BC (possibly much earlier).{{citation needed|date=July 2010|reason=no manuscript dates back that far and reliable secondary sources disagree}} A method for finding very good approximations to the square roots of 2 and 3 are given in the ''[[Baudhayana Sulba Sutra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, ch.8.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aryabhata]] in the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (section 2.4), has given a method for finding the square root of numbers having many digits.

It was known to the ancient Greeks that square roots of [[Natural number|positive whole numbers]] that are not [[Square number|perfect square]]s are always [[irrational number]]s: numbers not expressible as a [[ratio]] of two integers (that is to say they cannot be written exactly as ''m/n'', where ''m'' and ''n'' are integers). This is the theorem [[Euclid's Elements|''Euclid X, 9'']] almost certainly due to [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] dating back to circa 380&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The particular case [[Square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]] is assumed to date back earlier to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] and is traditionally attributed to [[Hippasus]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} It is exactly the length of the [[diagonal]] of a [[unit square|square with side length 1]].

In the Chinese mathematical work ''[[Suàn shù shū|Writings on Reckoning]]'', written between 202&amp;nbsp;BC and 186&amp;nbsp;BC during the early [[Han Dynasty]], the square root is approximated by using an "excess and deficiency" method, which says to "...combine the excess and deficiency as the divisor; (taking) the deficiency numerator multiplied by the excess denominator and the excess numerator times the deficiency denominator, combine them as the dividend."&lt;ref&gt;Dauben (2007), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

A symbol for square roots, written as an elaborate R, was invented by [[Regiomontanus]] (1436–1476). An R was also used for Radix to indicate square roots in [[Gerolamo Cardano]]'s ''[[Ars Magna (Gerolamo Cardano)|Ars Magna]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrich.maths.org/6546|title=The Development of Algebra - 2|work=maths.org|accessdate=19 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141124102946/http://nrich.maths.org/6546|archivedate=24 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian of mathematics [[David Eugene Smith|D.E. Smith]], Aryabhata's method for finding the square root was first introduced in Europe by [[Pietro di Giacomo Cataneo|Cataneo]] in 1546.

According to Jeffrey A. Oaks, Arabs used the letter ''[[Gimel#Arabic ĝīm|jīm/ĝīm]]'' ({{lang|ar|ج}}), the first letter of the word “{{lang|ar|جذر}}” (variously transliterated as ''jaḏr'', ''jiḏr'', ''ǧaḏr'' or ''ǧiḏr'', “root”), placed in its initial form ({{lang|ar|&amp;#65183;}}) over a number to indicate its square root. The letter ''jīm'' resembles the present square root shape. Its usage goes as far as the end of the twelfth century  in the works of the Moroccan mathematician [[Ibn al-Yasamin]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite thesis | title=Algebraic Symbolism in Medieval Arabic Algebra | first1=Jeffrey A. | last1=Oaks | publisher=Philosophica | year=2012 | page=36 | url=http://logica.ugent.be/philosophica/fulltexts/87-2.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203134229/http://logica.ugent.be/philosophica/fulltexts/87-2.pdf | archivedate=2016-12-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol '√' for the square root was first used in print in 1525 in [[Christoph Rudolff]]'s ''Coss''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Manguel|first=Alberto| chapter=Done on paper: the dual nature of numbers and the page | title=The Life of Numbers | year=2006 | isbn=84-86882-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties and uses==
[[Image:Square root 0 25.svg|thumb|400px|The graph of the function ''f''(''x'') = {{sqrt|''x''}}, made up of half a [[parabola]] with a vertical [[Directrix (conic section)#Eccentricity, focus and directrix|directrix]] ]]
The principal square root function ''f''(''x'') = {{sqrt|''x''}} (usually just referred to as the "square root function") is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that maps the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of nonnegative real numbers onto itself. In [[geometry|geometrical]] terms, the square root function maps the [[area]] of a square to its side length.

The square root of ''x'' is rational if and only if ''x'' is a [[rational number]] that can be represented as a ratio of two perfect squares. (See [[square root of 2]] for proofs that this is an irrational number, and [[quadratic irrational]] for a proof for all non-square natural numbers.) The square root function maps rational numbers into [[algebraic number]]s (a [[superset]] of the rational numbers).

For all real numbers ''x'',

:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{x^2} = \left|x\right| = 
\begin{cases} 
  x,  &amp; \mbox{if }x \ge 0 \\
  -x, &amp; \mbox{if }x &lt; 0. 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(see [[absolute value]])

For all nonnegative real numbers ''x'' and ''y'',

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt x \sqrt y&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt x = x^{1/2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The square root function is [[Continuous function|continuous]] for all nonnegative ''x'' and [[derivative|differentiable]] for all positive ''x''. If ''f'' denotes the square root function, its derivative is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt x}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Taylor series]] of {{sqrt|1 + ''x''}} about ''x'' = 0 converges for {{abs|''x''}} ≤ 1 and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1 + x} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n(2n)!}{(1-2n)(n!)^2(4^n)}x^n = 1 + \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{1}{16} x^3 - \frac{5}{128} x^4 + \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

The square root of a nonnegative number is used in the definition of [[Euclidean norm]] (and [[Euclidean distance|distance]]), as well as in generalizations such as [[Hilbert space]]s. It defines an important concept of [[standard deviation]] used in probability theory and statistics. It has a major use in the formula for roots of a [[quadratic equation]]; [[quadratic field]]s and rings of [[quadratic integer]]s, which are based on square roots, are important in algebra and have uses in geometry. Square roots frequently appear in mathematical formulas elsewhere, as well as in many [[physics|physical]] laws.

==Computation==
{{Main article|Methods of computing square roots}}
Most [[pocket calculator]]s have a square root key. Computer [[spreadsheet]]s and other [[software]] are also frequently used to calculate square roots. Pocket calculators typically implement efficient routines, such as the [[Newton's method]] (frequently with an initial guess of 1), to compute the square root of a positive real number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parkhurst|first=David F.|title=Introduction to Applied Mathematics for Environmental Science|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780387342283|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solow|first=Anita E.|title=Learning by Discovery: A Lab Manual for Calculus|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780883850831|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When computing square roots with [[Common logarithm|logarithm table]]s or [[slide rule]]s, one can exploit the identities

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a} = e^{(\ln a)/2} = 10^{(\log_{10} a)/2},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|ln}} and {{math|log}}&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[Natural logarithm|natural]] and [[base-10 logarithm]]s.

For this technique it's prudent to use the identity

:&lt;math&gt;(x + c)^2 = x^2 + 2xc + c^2,&lt;/math&gt;

as it allows one to adjust the estimate ''x'' by some amount ''c'' and measure the square of the adjustment in terms of the original estimate and its square. Furthermore, (''x'' + ''c'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''xc'' when ''c'' is close to 0, because the [[tangent line]] to the graph of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''xc'' + ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at ''c'' = 0, as a function of ''c'' alone, is ''y'' = 2''xc'' + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, small adjustments to ''x'' can be planned out by setting 2''xc'' to ''a'', or ''c'' = ''a''/(2''x'').

The most common [[iterative method]] of square root calculation by hand is known as the "[[Babylonian method]]" or "Heron's method" after the first-century Greek philosopher [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron of Alexandria]], who first described it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The method uses the same iterative scheme as the [[Newton–Raphson method]] yields when applied to the function y = ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a'', using the fact that its slope at any point is ''dy''/''dx'' = ''{{prime|f}}''(''x'') = 2''x'', but predates it by many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
The algorithm is to repeat a simple calculation that results in a number closer to the actual square root each time it is repeated with its result as the new input. The motivation is that if ''x'' is an overestimate to the square root of a nonnegative real number ''a'' then ''a''/''x''&lt;!-- please avoid intermixing &lt;math&gt; with a bare text in one paragraph: it is the ugliest pair among 3 existing styles --&gt; will be an underestimate and so the average of these two numbers is a better approximation than either of them. However, the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]] shows this average is always an overestimate of the square root (as noted [[Square root#Geometric construction of the square root|below]]), and so it can serve as a new overestimate with which to repeat the process, which [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] as a consequence of the successive overestimates and underestimates being closer to each other after each iteration. To find ''x'':

# Start with an arbitrary positive start value ''x''. The closer to the square root of ''a'', the fewer the iterations that will be needed to achieve the desired precision.
# Replace ''x'' by the average (''x'' + ''a''/''x'') / 2 between ''x'' and ''a''/''x''.
# Repeat from step 2, using this average as the new value of ''x''.

That is, if an arbitrary guess for {{sqrt|''a''}} is ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and {{nowrap|1 = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''a''/''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') / 2}}, then each x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is an approximation of {{sqrt|''a''}} which is better for large ''n'' than for small ''n''. If ''a'' is positive, the convergence is [[Rate of convergence|quadratic]], which means that in approaching the limit, the number of correct digits roughly doubles in each next iteration. If {{nowrap|1 =''a'' = 0}}, the convergence is only linear.

Using the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a} = 2^{-n}\sqrt{4^n a},&lt;/math&gt;

the computation of the square root of a positive number can be reduced to that of a number in the range {{closed-open|1,4}}. This simplifies finding a start value for the iterative method that is close to the square root, for which a [[Polynomial function|polynomial]] or [[Piecewise linear function|piecewise-linear]] [[Approximation theory|approximation]] can be used.

The [[Computational complexity theory|time complexity]] for computing a square root with ''n'' digits of precision is equivalent to that of multiplying two ''n''-digit numbers.

Another useful method for calculating the square root is the [[shifting nth root algorithm]], applied for {{nowrap|1= ''n'' = 2}}.

The name of the square root [[Function (programming)|function]] varies from [[programming language]] to programming language, with &lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Function sqrt |work=CPlusPlus.com |date=2016 |publisher=The C++ Resources Network |url=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cmath/sqrt/ |access-date=June 24, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122050619/http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cmath/sqrt/ |archivedate=November 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (often pronounced "squirt" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=C++ for the Impatient |first=Brian |last=Overland |page=338 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |date=2013 |isbn=9780133257120 |oclc=850705706 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJFpV-_t4WkC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=%22squirt%22+sqrt+C%2B%2B&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEwfj04sHNAhUY0GMKHatGDnsQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22squirt%22%20sqrt%20C%2B%2B&amp;f=false |access-date=June 24, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901082021/https://books.google.com/books?id=eJFpV-_t4WkC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=%22squirt%22+sqrt+C%2B%2B&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEwfj04sHNAhUY0GMKHatGDnsQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22squirt%22%20sqrt%20C%2B%2B&amp;f=false |archivedate=September 1, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) being common, used in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and derived languages like [[JavaScript]], [[PHP]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

The square of any positive or negative number is positive, and the square of 0 is 0. Therefore, no negative number can have a [[real number|real]] square root.  However, it is possible to work with a more inclusive set of numbers, called the [[complex number]]s, that does contain solutions to the square root of a negative number.  This is done by introducing a new number, denoted by ''i'' (sometimes ''j'', especially in the context of [[electric current|electricity]] where "''i''" traditionally represents electric current) and called the [[imaginary unit]], which is ''defined'' such that {{nowrap|1=''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1}}. Using this notation, we can think of ''i'' as the square root of −1, but notice that we also have {{nowrap|1=(−''i'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −1}} and so −''i'' is also a square root of −1. By convention, the principal square root of −1 is ''i'', or more generally, if ''x'' is any nonnegative number, then the principal square root of −''x'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-x} = i \sqrt x.&lt;/math&gt;

The right side (as well as its negative) is indeed a square root of −''x'', since

:&lt;math&gt;(i\sqrt x)^2 = i^2(\sqrt x)^2 = (-1)x = -x.&lt;/math&gt;

For every non-zero complex number ''z'' there exist precisely two numbers ''w'' such that {{nowrap|1=''w''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''}}: the principal square root of ''z'' (defined below), and its negative.

===Square root of an imaginary number===
[[Image:Imaginary2Root.svg|right|thumb|The square roots of {{mvar|i}}]]

There are two complex numbers that square to a given arbitrary non-zero imaginary number &lt;math&gt;z= ai&lt;/math&gt; with real &lt;math&gt;a\ne 0:&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\pm\sqrt{ai}=\textstyle \pm\sqrt{|a|\sgn(a)i}= \pm\sqrt{|a|}\sqrt{\sgn(a)i}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sqrt{|a|}&lt;/math&gt; is a uniquely determined positve real number, determining the square roots of an imaginary number boils down to calculate &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\pm i}.&lt;/math&gt;

The principal square roots of &lt;math&gt;\pm i&lt;/math&gt; are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{+i} = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(1+i)\quad&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-i} = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - i\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(1-i)\quad&lt;/math&gt; (selected for positive real part), or
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-i} = -\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + i\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(-1+i)\quad&lt;/math&gt; (for least positive argument).

{{Collapse top|title=Derivation of the roots of &lt;math&gt;\pm i&lt;/math&gt;|width=80%}}

The result can be obtained [[algebra]]ically by finding real numbers ''a'' and ''b'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\pm i = (a+bi)^2&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;\pm i = a^2 + 2abi - b^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the two [[simultaneous equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align}
   2ab &amp;= \pm 1 \\
   a^2 - b^2 &amp;= 0
 \end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

with solutions

:&lt;math&gt;a = b = \pm \tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\quad&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{+i}\quad&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;a = -b = \pm \tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\quad&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-i}.&lt;/math&gt;

The choice of the [[principal root]]s yields the solutions given above.

The result can also be obtained by using [[de Moivre's formula]] and setting

:&lt;math&gt;\pm i = \cos(\pm\tfrac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi) + i\sin(\pm\tfrac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi),&lt;/math&gt;

for an arbitrary integer &lt;math&gt;k,&lt;/math&gt; which yields

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \left(\pm i \right)^{\frac 1 2} &amp; \in \left\{ \left ( \cos (\pm \tfrac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi) + i\sin(\pm\tfrac{\pi}{2}+ 2k\pi) \right )^{\frac{1}{2}},\; k \in \mathbb Z\right \}  \\
              &amp; = \left\{ \cos(\pm\tfrac{\pi}{4}) + i\sin(\pm\tfrac{\pi}{4}),\; \cos(\pm\tfrac{\pi}{4} + \pi) + i\sin(\pm \tfrac{\pi}{4} + \pi)\right\} \\
              &amp; = \left\{\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \pm i \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\;-\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mp i \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right\}\\
              &amp; = \left\{\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(1\pm i),\;\tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(-1\mp i)  \right\}. \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Principal square root of a complex number===
{{Visualisation complex number roots}}
To find a definition for the square root that allows us to consistently choose a single value, called the [[principal value]], we start by observing that any complex number ''x'' + ''iy'' can be viewed as a point in the plane, (''x'', ''y''), expressed using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]. The same point may be reinterpreted using [[polar coordinates]] as the pair &lt;math&gt;(r, \varphi&lt;/math&gt;), where ''r'' ≥ 0 is the distance of the point from the origin, and  &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is the angle that the line from the origin to the point makes with the positive real (''x'') axis. In complex analysis, the location of this point is conventionally written &lt;math&gt;re^{i\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt; If

:&lt;math&gt; z=r e^{i \varphi} \text{ with } -\pi &lt; \varphi \le \pi, &lt;/math&gt;

then we define the principal square root of ''z'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z} = \sqrt{r} e^{i \varphi / 2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The principal square root function is thus defined using the nonpositive real axis as a [[branch cut]].  The principal square root function is [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] everywhere except on the set of non-positive real numbers (on strictly negative reals it isn't even [[continuous function|continuous]]). The above Taylor series for {{sqrt|1 + ''x''}} remains valid for complex numbers ''x'' with {{nowrap|{{abs|''x''}} &lt; 1}}.

The above can also be expressed in terms of [[trigonometric function]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{r \left(\cos \varphi + i \sin \varphi \right)} = \sqrt{r} \left ( \cos \frac{\varphi}{2} + i \sin \frac{\varphi}{2} \right ) .&lt;/math&gt;

===Algebraic formula===
When the number is expressed using Cartesian coordinates the following formula can be used for the principal square root:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z} = \sqrt{\frac{|z| + \operatorname{Re}(z)}{2}} \pm i\ \sqrt{\frac{|z| - \operatorname{Re}(z)}{2}},&lt;/math&gt;
where the [[Sign function|sign]] of the imaginary part of the root is taken to be the same as the sign of the imaginary part of the original number, or positive when zero. The real part of the principal value is always nonnegative.

===Notes===

In the following, the complex ''z'' and ''w'' may be expressed as:

* &lt;math&gt; z=|z|e^{i \theta_z}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; w=|w|e^{i \theta_w}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;-\pi&lt;\theta_z\le\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\pi&lt;\theta_w\le\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of the discontinuous nature of the square root function in the complex plane, the following laws are '''not true''' in general.

*  &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{zw} = \sqrt{z} \sqrt{w}&lt;/math&gt; (counterexample for the principal square root: {{math|1=''z'' = −1}} and  {{math|1=''w'' = −1}}) This equality is valid only when &lt;math&gt;-\pi&lt;\theta_z+\theta_w\le\pi&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{w}}{\sqrt z} = \sqrt{\frac{w}{z}}&lt;/math&gt; (counterexample for the principal square root: {{math|1=''w'' = 1}} and {{math|1=''z'' = −1}})This equality is valid only when &lt;math&gt;-\pi&lt;\theta_w-\theta_z\le\pi&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z^*} = \left( \sqrt z \right)^*&lt;/math&gt; (counterexample for the principal square root: {{math|1=''z'' = −1}})This equality is valid only when &lt;math&gt;\theta_z\ne\pi&lt;/math&gt;

A similar problem appears with other complex functions with branch cuts, e.g., the [[complex logarithm]] and the relations {{math|1=log&amp;thinsp;''z'' + log&amp;thinsp;''w'' = log(''zw'')}} or {{math|1=log&amp;thinsp;(''z''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) = log&amp;thinsp;(''z'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}} which are not true in general.

Wrongly assuming one of these laws underlies several faulty "proofs", for instance the following one showing that {{math|1=−1 = 1}}:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
-1 &amp;= i \cdot i \\
&amp;= \sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{-1} \\
&amp;= \sqrt{\left(-1\right)\cdot\left(-1\right)} \\
&amp;= \sqrt{1} \\
&amp;= 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The third equality cannot be justified (see [[invalid proof]]). It can be made to hold by changing the meaning of √ so that this no longer represents the principal square root (see above) but selects a branch for the square root that contains ({{sqrt|−1}})·({{sqrt|−1}}). The left-hand side becomes either

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{-1}=i \cdot i=-1&lt;/math&gt;

if the branch includes +''i'' or

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{-1}=(-i) \cdot (-i)=-1&lt;/math&gt;

if the branch includes −''i'', while the right-hand side becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\left(-1\right)\cdot\left(-1\right)}=\sqrt{1}=-1,&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality, {{math|1={{sqrt|1}} = −1}}, is a consequence of the choice of branch in the redefinition of √.

==Square roots of matrices and operators==
{{Main article|Square root of a matrix}}
{{See also|Square root of a 2 by 2 matrix}}

If ''A'' is a [[positive-definite matrix]] or operator, then there exists precisely one positive definite matrix or operator ''B'' with {{nowrap|1=''B''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''A''}}; we then define {{nowrap|1=''A''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''}}. In general matrices may have multiple square roots or even an infinitude of them.  For example, the {{nowrap|2 × 2}} [[identity matrix]] has an infinity of square roots,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Douglas W., "Using Pythagorean triples to generate square roots of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;", ''Mathematical Gazette'' 87, November 2003, 499–500.&lt;/ref&gt; though only one of them is positive definite.

==In integral domains, including fields==
Each element of an [[integral domain]] has no more than 2 square roots. The [[difference of two squares]] identity {{math|1=''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (''u'' − ''v'')(''u'' + ''v'')}} is proved using the [[commutative ring|commutativity of multiplication]]. If {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are square roots of the same element, then {{math|1=''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0}}. Because there are no [[zero divisors]] this implies {{math|1=''u'' = ''v''}} or {{math|1=''u'' + ''v'' = 0}}, where the latter means that two roots are [[additive inverse]]s of each other. In other words if an element a square root {{mvar|u}} of an element {{mvar|a}} exists, then the only square roots of {{mvar|a}} are {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|&amp;minus;u}}. The only square root of 0 in an integral domain is 0 itself.

In a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]&amp;nbsp;2, an element either has one square root or does not have any at all, because each element is its own additive inverse, so that {{math|1=&amp;minus;''u'' = ''u''}}. If the field is [[finite field|finite]] of characteristic&amp;nbsp;2 then every element has a unique square root. In a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of any other characteristic, any non-zero element either has two square roots, as explained above, or does not have any.

Given an odd [[prime number]] {{mvar|p}}, let {{math|1=''q'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''e''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for some positive integer {{mvar|e}}. A non-zero element of the field [[finite field|{{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}}]] with {{mvar|q}} elements is a [[quadratic residue]] if it has a square root in {{math|'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Otherwise, it is a quadratic non-residue. There are {{math|(''q'' − 1)/2}} quadratic residues and {{math|(''q'' − 1)/2}} quadratic non-residues; zero is not counted in either class. The quadratic residues form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication. The properties of quadratic residues are widely used in [[number theory]].

==In rings in general==
In a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] we call an element ''b'' a square root of ''a'' [[iff]] {{nowrap|1=''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''}}.
To see that the square root need not be unique up to sign in a general ring, consider the ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/8\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; from [[modular arithmetic]]. Here, the element 1 has four distinct square roots, namely ±1 and ±3. On the other hand, the element 2 has no square root. See also the article [[quadratic residue]] for details.

Another example is provided by the [[quaternion]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; in which the element −1 has an [[quaternion#Square roots of −1|infinitude of square roots]] including ±''i'', ±''j'', and ±''k''.

In fact, the set of square roots of −1 is exactly

:&lt;math&gt;\{ai + bj + ck \mid a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1\} .&lt;/math&gt;

Hence this set is exactly the same size and shape as the [[unit sphere|unit sphere in 3-space]].

The square root of 0 is by definition either 0 or a zero divisor, and where zero divisors do not exist (such as in quaternions and, generally, in [[division algebra]]s), it is uniquely 0. It is not necessarily true in general rings, where [[Z/nZ|{{math|'''Z'''/''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''Z'''}}]] for any natural {{mvar|n}} provides an easy counterexample.

==Principal square roots of the positive integers==

===As decimal expansions===
The square roots of the [[square number|perfect square]]s (1, 4, 9, 16, etc.) are [[integers]]. In all other cases, the square roots of positive integers are [[irrational number]]s, and therefore their [[decimal representation]]s are non-[[repeating decimal]]s.

If the radicand is not [[square-free integer|square-free]], then one can [[product (mathematics)|factor]].  For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   \sqrt{8} &amp;= \sqrt{4}\sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2} \\
   \sqrt{12} &amp;= \sqrt{4}\sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3} \\
   \sqrt{18} &amp;= \sqrt{9}\sqrt{2} = 3\sqrt{2} \\
   \sqrt{20} &amp;= \sqrt{4}\sqrt{5} = 2\sqrt{5}.
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===As expansions in other numeral systems===
The square roots of the [[square number|perfect square]]s (1, 4, 9, 16, etc.) are integers. In all other cases, the square roots of positive integers are [[irrational number]]s, and therefore their representations in any standard [[positional notation]] system are non-repeating.

The square roots of small integers are used in both the [[SHA-1]] and [[SHA-2]] hash function designs to provide [[nothing up my sleeve number]]s.

===As periodic continued fractions===
One of the most intriguing results from the study of [[irrational number]]s as [[continued fraction]]s was obtained by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] {{circa}} 1780. Lagrange found that the representation of the square root of any non-square positive integer as a continued fraction is [[Periodic continued fraction|periodic]]. That is, a certain pattern of partial denominators repeats indefinitely in the continued fraction. In a sense these square roots are the very simplest irrational numbers, because they can be represented with a simple repeating pattern of integers.

The square bracket notation used above is a sort of mathematical shorthand to conserve space. Written in more traditional notation the simple continued fraction for the square root of 11, [3; 3, 6, 3, 6, ...], looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{11} = 3 + \cfrac{1}{3 + \cfrac{1}{6 + \cfrac{1}{3 + \cfrac{1}{6 + \cfrac{1}{3 + \ddots}}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the two-digit pattern {3, 6} repeats over and over again in the partial denominators. Since {{nowrap|1=11 = 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2}}, the above is also identical to the following [[generalized continued fraction#Roots of positive numbers|generalized continued fractions]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{11} = 3 + \cfrac{2}{6 + \cfrac{2}{6 + \cfrac{2}{6 + \cfrac{2}{6 + \cfrac{2}{6 + \ddots}}}}} = 3 + \cfrac{6\cdot 1}{20-1 - \cfrac{1}{20 - \cfrac{1}{20 - \cfrac{1}{20 - \ddots}}}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Geometric construction of the square root==
[[File:Euclid Corollary 5.svg|thumb|The [[Spiral of Theodorus]] up to the triangle with a hypotenuse of {{math|{{radic|4}}}} ({{math|1 {{=}} {{sqrt|1}}}})]]

The square root of a positive number is usually defined as the side length of a [[square]] with the [[area]] equal to the given number. But the square shape is not necessary for it: if one of two [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] [[Euclidean plane|planar Euclidean]] objects has the area ''a'' times greater than another, then the ratio of their linear sizes is {{sqrt|''a''}}.

A square root can be constructed with a compass and straightedge. In his [[Euclid's Elements|Elements]], [[Euclid]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 300&amp;nbsp;BC) gave the construction of the [[geometric mean]] of two quantities in two different places: [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookII/propII14.html Proposition II.14] and [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVI/propVI13.html Proposition VI.13].  Since the geometric mean of ''a'' and ''b'' is {{sqrt|''ab''}}, one can construct {{sqrt|''a''}} simply by taking {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 1}}.

The construction is also given by [[Descartes]] in his ''[[La Géométrie]]'', see figure 2 on [http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=00570001&amp;seq=12&amp;frames=0&amp;view=50 page 2]. However, Descartes made no claim to originality and his audience would have been quite familiar with Euclid.

Euclid's second proof in Book VI depends on the theory of [[Similar triangles#Similar triangles|similar triangles]]. Let AHB be a line segment of length {{nowrap|''a'' + ''b''}} with {{nowrap|1=AH = ''a''}} and {{nowrap|1=HB = ''b''}}. Construct the circle with AB as diameter and let C be one of the two intersections of the perpendicular chord at H with the circle and denote the length CH as ''h''. Then, using [[Thales' theorem]] and, as in the [[Pythagorean theorem#Proof using similar triangles|proof of Pythagoras' theorem by similar triangles]], triangle AHC is similar to triangle CHB (as indeed both are to triangle ACB, though we don't need that, but it is the essence of the proof of Pythagoras' theorem) so that AH:CH is as HC:HB, i.e. {{nowrap|1= ''a''/''h'' = ''h''/''b''}}, from which we conclude by cross-multiplication that {{nowrap|1= ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ab''}}, and finally that {{nowrap|1=''h'' = {{sqrt|''ab''}}}}. When marking the midpoint O of the line segment AB and drawing the radius OC of length {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''b'')/2}}, then clearly OC &gt; CH, i.e. {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''b'')/2 ≥ {{sqrt|''ab''}}}} (with equality if and only if {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}}), which is the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means|arithmetic–geometric mean inequality for two variables]] and, as noted [[Square root#Computation|above]], is the basis of the [[Greek Mathematics|Ancient Greek]] understanding of "Heron's method".

Another method of geometric construction uses [[right triangle]]s and [[Mathematical induction|induction]]: {{sqrt|1}} can, of course, be constructed, and once {{sqrt|''x''}} has been constructed, the right triangle with 1 and {{sqrt|''x''}} for its legs has a [[hypotenuse]] of {{sqrt|''x'' + 1}}. The [[Spiral of Theodorus]] is constructed using successive square roots in this manner.

|-
| 1945 || [[Norman Steenrod]]–[[Samuel Eilenberg]] ||| [[Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms]] for homology and cohomology.
|-
| 1945 || [[Jean Leray]] ||| Starts [[sheaf theory]]: At this time a sheaf was a map that assigned a module or a ring to a closed subspace of a topological space. The first example was the sheaf assigning to a closed subspace its p-th cohomology group.
|-
| 1945 || [[Jean Leray]] ||| Defines [[Sheaf cohomology]] using his new concept of sheaf.
|-
| 1946 || [[Jean Leray]] ||| Invents [[spectral sequences]] as a method for iteratively approximating cohomology groups by previous approximate cohomology groups. In the limiting case it gives the sought cohomology groups.
|-
| 1948 || Cartan seminar ||| Writes up [[sheaf theory]] for the first time.
|-
| 1948 || [[A. L. Blakers]] ||| [[Crossed complex]]es (called group systems by Blakers), after a suggestion of [[Samuel Eilenberg]]: A nonabelian generalization of [[chain complex]]es of abelian groups which are equivalent to strict ω-groupoids. They form a category Crs that has many satisfactory properties such as a [[monoidal category|monoidal structure]].

|-
| 1951 || [[Henri Cartan]] ||| Modern definition of [[sheaf theory]] in which a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] is defined using open subsets instead of closed subsets of a topological space and all the open subsets are treated at once. A sheaf on a topological space X becomes a functor resembling a function defined locally on X, and taking values in sets, abelian groups, commutative rings, modules or generally in any category C. In fact [[Alexander Grothendieck]] later made a [[dictionary between sheaves and functions]]. Another interpretation of sheaves is as continuously [[varying set]]s (a generalization of [[abstract set]]s). Its purpose is to provide a unified approach to connect local and global properties of topological spaces and to classify the obstructions for passing from local objects to global objects on a topological space by pasting together the local pieces. The C-valued sheaves on a topological space and their homomorphisms form a category.

|-
| 1958 || [[Alexander Grothendieck]] ||| Starts new foundation of [[algebraic geometry]] by generalizing varieties and other spaces in algebraic geometry to [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] which have the structure of a category with open subsets as objects and restrictions as morphisms.  form a category that is a [[Toposes#Grothendieck topoi .28topoi in geometry.29|Grothendieck topos]], and to a scheme and even a stack one may associate a Zariski topos, an étale topos, a fppf topos, a fpqc topos, a Nisnevich topos, a flat topos, ... depending on the topology imposed on the scheme. The whole of algebraic geometry was categorized with time.

|-
| 1963 || [[William Lawvere]] ||| Founds [[Categorical logic]], discovers [[internal logic (category theory)|internal logic]]s of categories and recognizes its importance and introduces [[Lawvere theories]]. Essentially categorical logic is a lift of different logics to being internal logics of categories. Each kind of category with extra structure corresponds to a system of logic with its own inference rules. A Lawvere theory is an [[theory (mathematical logic)|algebraic theory]] as a category with finite products and possessing a "generic algebra" (a generic group).

|-
| 1963 || [[Charles Ehresmann]] ||| [[Multiple categories]] and [[multiple functors]]
|-
| 1963 || [[Saunders Mac Lane]] ||| [[Monoidal categories]] also called tensor categories: Strict 2-categories with one object made by a [[relabelling trick]] to categories with a [[tensor product]] of objects that is secretly the composition of morphisms in the 2-category. There are several object in a monoidal category since the relabelling trick makes 2-morphisms of the 2-category to morphisms, morphisms of the 2-category to objects and forgets about the single object. In general a higher relabelling trick works for [[n-category|n-categories]] with one object to make general monoidal categories. The most common examples include: [[ribbon category|ribbon categories]], [[braided tensor category|braided tensor categories]], [[spherical category|spherical categories]], [[compact closed category|compact closed categories]], [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric tensor categories]], [[modular category|modular categories]], [[autonomous category|autonomous categories]], [[category with duality|categories with duality]]

|-
| 1964 || Barry Mitchell–[[Peter Freyd]] ||| [[Mitchell's embedding theorem|Mitchell–Freyd embedding theorem]]: Every small [[abelian category]] admits an exact and full embedding into the [[category of modules|category of (left) modules]] Mod&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; over some ring R
|-
| 1964 || [[Rudolf Haag]]–[[Daniel Kastler]] ||| [[Algebraic quantum field theory]] after ideas of [[Irving Segal]]
|-
| 1964 || [[Alexander Grothendieck]] ||| Topologizes categories axiomatically by imposing a [[Grothendieck topology]] on categories which are then called [[Grothendieck topology|sites]]. The purpose of sites is to define coverings on them so sheaves over sites can be defined. The other "spaces" one can define sheaves for except topological spaces are locales
|-
| 1964 || [[Michael Artin]]–[[Alexander Grothendieck]] ||| [[Étale cohomology#ℓ-adic cohomology groups|ℓ-adic cohomology]], technical development in SGA4 of the long-anticipated [[Weil cohomology]].
|-
| 1964 || [[Alexander Grothendieck]] ||| Proves the [[Weil conjectures]] except the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis
|-
| 1964 || [[Alexander Grothendieck]] ||| [[Six operations]] formalism in [[homological algebra]]; Rf&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, Rf&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sup&gt;!&lt;/sup&gt;, ⊗&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;, RHom, and proof of its closedness
|-
| 1964 || [[Alexander Grothendieck]]  ||| Introduced in a letter to [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] conjectural [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|motives (algebraic geometry)]] to express the idea that there is a single universal cohomology theory underlying the various cohomology theories for algebraic varieties. According to Grothendieck's philosophy there should be a universal cohomology functor attaching a [[Motive (algebraic geometry)#pure motives|pure motive]] h(X) to each smooth projective variety X. When X is not smooth or projective h(X) must be replaced by a more general [[Motive (algebraic geometry)#Mixed motives|mixed motiv]]e which has a weight filtration whose quotients are pure motivess. The [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|category of motives]] (the categorical framework for the universal cohomology theory) may be used as an abstract substitute for singular cohomology (and rational cohomology) to compare, relate and unite "motivated" properties and parallel phenomena of the various cohomology theories and to detect topological structure of algebraic varieties. The categories of pure motives and of mixed motives are abelian tensor categories and the category of pure motives is also a [[Tannakian category]]. Categories of motives are made by replacing the category of varieties by a category with the same objects but whose morphisms are [[correspondence (mathematics)#algebraic geometry|correspondence]]s, modulo a suitable equivalence relation. Different [[equivalence relation|equivalences]] give different theories. [[Rational equivalence]] gives the category of [[Chow motive]]s with [[Chow group]]s as morphisms which are in some sense universal. Every geometric cohomology theory is a functor on the category of motives. Each induced functor ρ:motives modulo numerical equivalence→graded '''Q'''-vector spaces is called a [[realization (probability)|realization]] of the category of motives, the inverse functors are called [[improvement (mathematics)|improvement]]s. Mixed motives explain phenomena in as diverse areas as: Hodge theory, algebraic K-theory, polylogarithms, regulator maps, automorphic forms, L-functions, ℓ-adic representations, trigonometric sums, homotopy of algebraic varieties, algebraic cycles, moduli spaces and thus has the potential of enriching each area and of unifying them all.

| 1973 || Chris Reedy ||| [[Reedy category|Reedy categories]]: Categories of "shapes" that can be used to do homotopy theory. A Reedy category is a category R equipped with a structure enabling the inductive construction of diagrams and natural transformations of shape R. The most important consequence of a Reedy structure on R is the existence of a model structure on the [[functor category]] M&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; whenever M is a [[model category]]. Another advantage of the Reedy structure is that its cofibrations, fibrations and factorizations are explicit. In a Reedy category there is a notion of an injective and a surjective morphism such that any morphism can be factored uniquely as a surjection followed by an injection. Examples are the ordinal α considered as a [[poset]] and hence a category. The opposite R° of a Reedy category R is a Reedy category. The [[simplex category]] Δ and more generally for any [[simplicial set]] X its category of simplices Δ/X is a Reedy category. The model structure on M&lt;sup&gt;Δ&lt;/sup&gt; for a model category M is described in an unpublished manuscript by Chris Reedy

Segal categories are a weak form of [[S-category|S-categories]], in which composition is only defined up to a coherent system of equivalences.&lt;BR&gt;
Segal categories were defined one year later implicitly by [[Graeme Segal]]. They were named Segal categories first by William Dwyer–[[Daniel Kan]]–Jeffrey Smith 1989. In their famous book Homotopy invariant algebraic structures on topological spaces J. Michael Boardman and Rainer Vogt called them [[quasi-category|quasi-categories]].

A stands for associative.&lt;BR&gt;
Def: A category C such that&lt;BR&gt;
1) for all X,Y in Ob(C) the [[Hom-set]]s Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X,Y) are finite-dimensional [[chain complex]]es of '''Z'''-graded modules&lt;BR&gt;
2) for all objects X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; in Ob(C) there is a family of linear composition maps (the higher compositions)&lt;BR&gt;
m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; : Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊗ Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊗ ... ⊗ Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;,X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) → Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) of degree n-2 (homological grading convention is used) for n≥1&lt;BR&gt;
3) m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the differential on the chain complex Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X,Y)&lt;BR&gt;
4) m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy the quadratic A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-associativity equation for all n≥0.

m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be [[chain map]]s but the compositions m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of higher order are not chain maps; nevertheless they are [[Massey product]]s. In particular it is a [[linear category]].

Examples are the [[Fukaya category]] Fuk(X) and [[loop space]] ΩX where X is a topological space and [[A∞-algebra|A]]&lt;sub&gt;[[A∞-algebra|∞]]&lt;/sub&gt;[[A∞-algebra|-algebras]] as A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories with one object.

When there are no higher maps (trivial homotopies) C is a [[dg-category]]. Every A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-category is quasiisomorphic in a functorial way to a dg-category. A quasiisomorphism is a chain map that is an isomorphism in homology.

The framework of dg-categories and dg-functors is too narrow for many problems, and it is preferable to consider the wider class of A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories and A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-functors. Many features of A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories and A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-functors come from the fact that they form a symmetric closed [[multicategory]], which is revealed in the language of [[monad (category theory)|comonads]]. From a higher-dimensional perspective A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories are weak ω-categories with all morphisms invertible. A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories can also be viewed as [[noncommutative formal dg-manifold]]s with a closed marked subscheme of objects.

| 1995 || [[André Joyal]]-[[Ieke Moerdijk]] ||| AST [[Algebraic set theory]]: Also sometimes called categorical set theory. It was developed from 1988 by André Joyal and Ieke Moerdijk, and was first presented in detail as a book in 1995 by them. AST is a framework based on category theory to study and organize [[Set theory#Axiomatic set theory|set theories]] and to construct [[model of set theories|models of set theories]]. The aim of AST is to provide a uniform [[categorical semantics]] or description of set theories of different kinds (classical or constructive, bounded, predicative or impredicative, well-founded or non-well-founded,...), the various constructions of the cumulative [[hierarchy of sets]], forcing models, sheaf models and realisability models. Instead of focusing on categories of sets AST focuses on categories of classes. The basic tool of AST is the notion of a [[category with class structure]] (a category of classes equipped with a class of small maps (the intuition being that their fibres are small in some sense), powerclasses and a universal object (a [[universe (mathematics)|universe]])) which provides an axiomatic framework in which models of set theory can be constructed. The notion of a class category permits both the definition of ZF-algebras ([[Zermelo-Fraenkel algebra]]) and related structures expressing the idea that the hierarchy of sets is an algebraic structure on the one hand and the interpretation of the first order logic of elementary set theory on the other. The subcategory of sets in a class category is an [[Topos (mathematics)#Elementary toposes .28toposes in logic.29|elementary topos]] and every elementary topos occurs as sets in a class category. The class category itself always embeds into the [[ideal completion]] of a topos. The interpretation of the logic is that in every class category the universe is a model of basic intuitionistic set theory BIST that is logically complete with respect to class category models. Therefore, class categories generalize both topos theory and intuitionistic set theory. AST founds and formalizes set theory on the ZF-algebra with operations union and successor (singleton) instead of on the membership relation. The [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF-axioms]] are nothing but a description of the free ZF-algebra just as the Peano axioms are a description of the free monoid on one generator. In this perspective the models of set theory are algebras for a suitably presented [[theory (mathematical logic)|algebraic theory]] and many familiar set theoretic conditions (such as well foundedness) are related to familiar algebraic conditions (such as freeness). Using an auxiliary notion of small map it is possible to extend the axioms of a topos and provide a general theory for uniformly constructing models of set theory out of toposes.

|-
| 1998 || André Hirschowitz-Carlos Simpson ||| Give a [[model category]] structure on the category of Segal categories.

In the case when A = QCoh(X) for X a scheme the pair (Spec(A),O&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) is naturally isomorphic to the scheme (X&lt;sup&gt;Zar&lt;/sup&gt;,O&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;) using the equivalence of categories QCoh(Spec(R))=Mod&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. More generally abelian categories or triangulated categories or dg-categories or A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories should be regarded as categories of quasicoherent sheaves (or complexes of sheaves) on noncommutative schemes. This is a starting point in [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]]. It means that one can think of the category A itself as a space. Since A is abelian it allows to naturally do [[homological algebra]] on noncommutative schemes and hence [[sheaf cohomology]].

| 1998 || [[Maxim Kontsevich]] ||| [[Calabi–Yau category|Calabi–Yau categories]]: A [[linear category]] with a trace map for each object of the category and an associated symmetric (with respects to objects) nondegenerate pairing to the trace map. If X is a smooth projective [[Calabi-Yau variety|Calabi&amp;mdash;Yau variety]] of dimension d then D&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;(Coh(X)) is a unital Calabi–Yau [[Fukaya category|A]]&lt;sub&gt;[[Fukaya category|∞]]&lt;/sub&gt;[[Fukaya category|-category]] of Calabi–Yau dimension d.

The topology on a space is treated not as a lattice, but as an [[exponential object]] of the same category as the original space, with an associated λ-calculus. Every expression in the λ-calculus denotes both a continuous function and a program. ASD does not use the [[category of sets]], but the full subcategory of overt discrete objects plays this role (an overt object is the dual to a compact object), forming an [[arithmetic universe]] (pretopos with lists) with general recursion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4138">In [[mathematics]], '''trailing zeros''' are a sequence of [[0 (number)|0]] in the [[decimal]] representation (or more generally, in any [[positional notation|positional representation]]) of a number, after which no other [[Numerical digit|digit]]s follow.

Trailing zeros to the right of a [[decimal point]], as in 12.3400, do not affect the value of a number and may be omitted if all that is of interest is its numerical value. This is true even if the zeros [[repeating decimal|recur infinitely]]. For example, in [[pharmacy]], trailing zeros are omitted from [[dose (biochemistry)|dose]] values to prevent misreading. However, trailing zeros may be useful for indicating the number of [[significant figures]], for example in a measurement.  In such a context, "simplifying" a number by removing trailing zeros would be incorrect. 

The number of trailing zeros in a non-zero base-''b'' [[integer]] ''n'' equals the exponent of the highest power of ''b'' that divides ''n''. For example, 14000 has three trailing zeros and is therefore divisible by 1000 = 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, but not by 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.  This property is useful when looking for small factors in [[integer factorization]].  Some [[computer architectures]] have a [[count trailing zeros]] operation in their [[instruction set]] for efficiently determining the number of trailing zero bits in a machine word.

==Factorial==
The number of trailing zeros in the [[decimal representation]] of ''n''!, the [[factorial]] of a [[non-negative]] [[integer]] ''n'', is simply the multiplicity of the [[prime number|prime]] factor&amp;nbsp;5 in ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  This can be determined with this special case of [[de Polignac's formula]]:&lt;ref&gt;Summarized from [http://www.purplemath.com/modules/factzero.htm Factorials and Trailing Zeroes]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = \sum_{i=1}^k \left \lfloor \frac{n}{5^i} \right \rfloor =
\left \lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{n}{5^2} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{n}{5^3} \right \rfloor + \cdots + \left \lfloor \frac{n}{5^k} \right \rfloor, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' must be chosen such that

:&lt;math&gt;5^{k+1} &gt; n,\,&lt;/math&gt;

more precisely

:&lt;math&gt;5^{k} \le n &lt; 5^{k+1},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;k = \left \lfloor \log_{5} n \right \rfloor,&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\lfloor a \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[floor function]] applied to ''a''. For ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;... this is

:0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, ... {{OEIS|A027868}}.

For example, 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;32, and therefore&amp;nbsp;32!&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;263130836933693530167218012160000000 ends in

:&lt;math&gt;\left \lfloor \frac{32}{5} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{32}{5^2} \right \rfloor = 6 + 1 = 7\,&lt;/math&gt;

zeros. If ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;5, the inequality is satisfied by ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; in that case the sum is [[empty sum|empty]], giving the answer&amp;nbsp;0.

The formula actually counts the number of factors&amp;nbsp;5 in ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but since there are at least as many factors&amp;nbsp;2, this is equivalent to the number of factors 10, each of which gives one more trailing zero.

Defining

:&lt;math&gt;q_i = \left \lfloor \frac{n}{5^i} \right \rfloor,\,&lt;/math&gt;

the following [[recurrence relation]] holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}q_0\,\,\,\,\, &amp; = \,\,\,n,\quad \\
 q_{i+1} &amp; = \left \lfloor \frac{q_i}{5} \right \rfloor.\,\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be used to simplify the computation of the terms of the summation, which can be stopped as soon as ''q&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' reaches zero. The condition {{nowrap|5&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''n''}} is equivalent to {{nowrap|1= ''q''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14818">:''For the direct limit of a sequence of ultrapowers, see [[Ultraproduct]].''
In [[mathematics]], an '''ultralimit''' is a geometric construction that assigns to a sequence of [[metric space]]s ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' a limiting metric space. The notion of an ultralimit captures the limiting behavior of finite configurations in the spaces ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and uses an [[ultrafilter]] to avoid the process of repeatedly passing to subsequences to ensure convergence. An ultralimit is a generalization of the notion of [[Gromov–Hausdorff convergence]] of metric spaces.

==Ultrafilters==

Recall that an [[ultrafilter]] ''&amp;omega;'' on the set of natural numbers {{math|ℕ}} is a set of nonempty subsets of {{math|ℕ}} (whose inclusion function can thought of as a measure) which is closed under finite intersection, upwards-closed, and which, given any subset ''X'' of {{math|ℕ}}, contains  either ''X'' or {{math|ℕ∖ ''X''}}.  An ultrafilter ''&amp;omega;'' on {{math|ℕ}} is ''non-principal'' if it contains no finite set.

==Limit of a sequence of points with respect to an ultrafilter==

Let ''&amp;omega;'' be a non-principal ultrafilter on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N &lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n\in \mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of points in a [[metric space]] (''X'',''d'') and ''x''∈ ''X'', the point ''x'' is called the ''&amp;omega;'' -''limit'' of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;x=\lim_\omega x_n&lt;/math&gt;, if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\{n: d(x_n,x)\le \epsilon \}\in\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

It is not hard to see the following:
* If an ''&amp;omega;'' -limit of a sequence of points exists, it is unique.
* If &lt;math&gt;x=\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n &lt;/math&gt; in the standard sense, &lt;math&gt;x=\lim_\omega x_n &lt;/math&gt;. (For this property to hold it is crucial that the ultrafilter be non-principal.)

An important basic fact&lt;ref name="KL"/&gt;  states that, if (''X'',''d'') is compact and ''&amp;omega;'' is a non-principal ultrafilter on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N &lt;/math&gt;, the ''&amp;omega;''-limit of any sequence of points in ''X'' exists (and is necessarily unique).

In particular, any bounded sequence of real numbers has a well-defined ''&amp;omega;''-limit  in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; (as closed intervals are compact).

==Ultralimit of metric spaces with specified base-points==
Let ''&amp;omega;'' be a non-principal ultrafilter on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N &lt;/math&gt;. Let (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a sequence of [[metric space]]s with specified base-points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;∈''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Let us say that a sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;∈''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, is ''admissible'', if the sequence of real numbers (''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''))&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is bounded, that is, if there exists a positive real number ''C'' such that  &lt;math&gt; d_n(x_n,p_n)\le C&lt;/math&gt;.
Let us denote the set of all admissible sequences by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;.

It is easy to see from the triangle inequality that for any two admissible sequences &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x=(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y=(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; the sequence (''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''))&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is bounded and hence there exists an ''&amp;omega;''-limit  &lt;math&gt;\hat d_\infty(\mathbf x, \mathbf y):=\lim_\omega d_n(x_n,y_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Let us define a relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; of all admissible sequences as follows. For &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x, \mathbf y\in \mathcal A &lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x\sim\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\hat d_\infty(\mathbf x, \mathbf y)=0.&lt;/math&gt; It is easy to show that &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivalence relation]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''ultralimit''' with respect to ''&amp;omega;'' of the sequence (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a metric space &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, d_\infty)&lt;/math&gt; defined as follows.&lt;ref&gt;John Roe. ''Lectures on Coarse Geometry.'' [[American Mathematical Society]], 2003. {{isbn|978-0-8218-3332-2}}; Definition 7.19, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a set, we have &lt;math&gt;X_\infty=\mathcal A/{\sim}&lt;/math&gt; .

For two &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;-equivalence classes &lt;math&gt;[\mathbf x], [\mathbf y]&lt;/math&gt; of admissible sequences &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x=(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y=(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;d_\infty([\mathbf x], [\mathbf y]):=\hat d_\infty(\mathbf x,\mathbf y)=\lim_\omega d_n(x_n,y_n).&lt;/math&gt;

It is not hard to see that &lt;math&gt;d_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined and that it is a [[metric space|metric]] on the set  &lt;math&gt;X_\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Denote &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, d_\infty)=\lim_\omega(X_n,d_n, p_n)&lt;/math&gt; .

==On basepoints in the case of uniformly bounded spaces==

Suppose that (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is a sequence of [[metric space]]s of uniformly bounded diameter, that is, there exists a real number ''C''&gt;0 such that diam(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)≤''C'' for every &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;.  Then for any choice ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of base-points in ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ''every'' sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_n, x_n\in X_n&lt;/math&gt; is admissible. Therefore, in this situation the choice of base-points does not have to be specified when defining an ultralimit, and the ultralimit &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, d_\infty)&lt;/math&gt; depends only on (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')  and on ''&amp;omega;'' but does not depend on the choice of a base-point sequence &lt;math&gt;p_n\in X_n.&lt;/math&gt;. In this case one writes &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, d_\infty)=\lim_\omega(X_n,d_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Basic properties of ultralimits==

#If (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') are [[geodesic metric space]]s then &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, d_\infty)=\lim_\omega(X_n, d_n, p_n)&lt;/math&gt; is also a geodesic metric space.&lt;ref name="KL" /&gt;
#If (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') are [[complete metric space]]s then &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, d_\infty)=\lim_\omega(X_n,d_n, p_n)&lt;/math&gt; is also a complete metric space.&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;L.Van den Dries, A.J.Wilkie, ''On Gromov's theorem concerning groups of polynomial growth and elementary logic''. [[Journal of Algebra]], Vol. 89(1984), pp. 349&amp;ndash;374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Roe. ''Lectures on Coarse Geometry.'' [[American Mathematical Society]], 2003. {{isbn|978-0-8218-3332-2}}; Proposition 7.20, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;
Actually, by construction, the limit space is always complete, even when (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')
is a repeating sequence of a space (''X'',''d'') which is not complete.&lt;ref&gt;Bridson, Haefliger "Metric Spaces of Non-positive curvature" Lemma 5.53&lt;/ref&gt;
#If (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') are compact metric spaces that converge to a compact metric space (''X'',''d'') in the [[Gromov–Hausdorff convergence|Gromov–Hausdorff]] sense (this automatically implies that the spaces (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') have uniformly bounded diameter), then the ultralimit &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, d_\infty)=\lim_\omega(X_n,d_n)&lt;/math&gt; is isometric to (''X'',''d'').
#Suppose that (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') are [[proper metric space]]s and that &lt;math&gt;p_n\in X_n&lt;/math&gt; are base-points such that the pointed sequence  (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') converges to a proper metric space (''X'',''d'') in the [[Gromov–Hausdorff convergence|Gromov–Hausdorff]] sense. Then the ultralimit &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, d_\infty)=\lim_\omega(X_n,d_n,p_n)&lt;/math&gt; is isometric to (''X'',''d'').&lt;ref name="KL"/&gt;
#Let ''&amp;kappa;''≤0 and let (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')  be a sequence of [[CAT(k) space|CAT(''&amp;kappa;'')-metric spaces]]. Then the ultralimit &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, d_\infty)=\lim_\omega(X_n,d_n, p_n)&lt;/math&gt; is also a CAT(''&amp;kappa;'')-space.&lt;ref name="KL"&gt;M. Kapovich B. Leeb. ''On asymptotic cones and quasi-isometry classes of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds'', [[Geometric and Functional Analysis (GAFA)|Geometric and Functional Analysis]], Vol. 5 (1995), no. 3, pp. 582&amp;ndash;603&lt;/ref&gt;
#Let (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')  be a sequence of [[CAT(k) space|CAT(''&amp;kappa;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')-metric spaces]] where &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\kappa_n=-\infty.&lt;/math&gt; Then the ultralimit &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, d_\infty)=\lim_\omega(X_n,d_n, p_n)&lt;/math&gt; is [[real tree]].&lt;ref name="KL"/&gt;

==Asymptotic cones==
An important class of ultralimits are the so-called ''asymptotic cones'' of metric spaces. Let (''X'',''d'') be a metric space, let ''&amp;omega;'' be a non-principal ultrafilter on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N &lt;/math&gt; and let ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' be a sequence of base-points. Then the ''&amp;omega;''&amp;ndash;ultralimit of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(X, \frac{d}{n}, p_n)&lt;/math&gt; is called the asymptotic cone of ''X'' with respect to ''&amp;omega;'' and &lt;math&gt;(p_n)_n\,&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted &lt;math&gt;Cone_\omega(X,d, (p_n)_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;. One often takes the base-point sequence to be constant, ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''p'' for some ''p &amp;isin; X''; in this case the asymptotic cone does not depend on the choice of ''p &amp;isin; X'' and is denoted by  &lt;math&gt;Cone_\omega(X,d)\,&lt;/math&gt; or just &lt;math&gt;Cone_\omega(X)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The notion of an asymptotic cone plays an important role in [[geometric group theory]] since asymptotic cones (or, more precisely, their [[homeomorphism|topological types]] and [[Lipschitz continuity|bi-Lipschitz types]]) provide [[quasi-isometry]] invariants of metric spaces in general and of finitely generated groups in particular.&lt;ref name="Roe"&gt;John Roe. ''Lectures on Coarse Geometry.'' [[American Mathematical Society]], 2003. {{isbn|978-0-8218-3332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asymptotic cones also turn out to be a useful tool in the study of [[relatively hyperbolic group]]s and their generalizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cornelia Druţu]] and Mark Sapir (with an Appendix by [[Denis Osin]] and Mark Sapir), ''Tree-graded spaces and asymptotic cones of groups.'' [[Topology (journal)|Topology]], Volume 44 (2005), no. 5, pp. 959&amp;ndash;1058.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
#Let (''X'',''d'') be a compact metric space and put (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)=(''X'',''d'') for every &lt;math&gt; n\in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ultralimit &lt;math&gt;(X_\infty, d_\infty)=\lim_\omega(X_n,d_n)&lt;/math&gt; is isometric to (''X'',''d'').
#Let (''X'',''d&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'') and (''Y'',''d&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'') be two distinct compact metric spaces and let (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') be a sequence of metric spaces such that for each ''n'' either (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')=(''X'',''d&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'') or (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'',''d&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')=(''Y'',''d&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''). Let &lt;math&gt;A_1=\{n | (X_n,d_n)=(X,d_X)\}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_2=\{n | (X_n,d_n)=(Y,d_Y)\}\,&lt;/math&gt;. Thus ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are disjoint and &lt;math&gt;A_1\cup A_2=\mathbb N.&lt;/math&gt;  Therefore, one of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  has ''&amp;omega;''-measure 1 and the other has ''&amp;omega;''-measure 0. Hence &lt;math&gt;\lim_\omega(X_n,d_n)&lt;/math&gt; is isometric to (''X'',''d&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'') if ''&amp;omega;''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)=1 and &lt;math&gt;\lim_\omega(X_n,d_n)&lt;/math&gt; is isometric to (''Y'',''d&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'') if ''&amp;omega;''(''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)=1. This shows that the ultralimit can depend on the choice of an ultrafilter ''&amp;omega;''.
#Let (''M'',''g'') be a compact connected [[Riemannian manifold]] of dimension ''m'', where ''g'' is a [[Riemannian metric]] on ''M''. Let ''d'' be the metric on ''M'' corresponding to ''g'', so that (''M'',''d'') is a [[geodesic metric space]]. Choose a basepoint ''p''∈''M''. Then the ultralimit (and even the ordinary [[Gromov-Hausdorff limit]]) &lt;math&gt;\lim_\omega(M,n d, p)&lt;/math&gt; is isometric to the [[tangent space]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M'' of ''M'' at ''p'' with the distance function on ''T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;M'' given by the [[inner product]] ''g(p)''. Therefore, the ultralimit &lt;math&gt;\lim_\omega(M,n d, p)&lt;/math&gt; is isometric to the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^m&lt;/math&gt; with the standard [[Euclidean metric]].&lt;ref&gt;Yu.

In [[predicate logic]] '''universal instantiation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irving M. Copi |author2=Carl Cohen |author3=Kenneth McMahon |title=Introduction to Logic | date = Nov 2010 | isbn=978-0205820375 |publisher=Pearson Education}}{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hurley{{full citation needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker{{full citation needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''UI'''; also called '''universal specification''' or '''universal elimination''', and sometimes confused with ''[[Dictum de omni et nullo|dictum de omni]]'') is a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of inference]] from a truth about each member of a class of individuals to the truth about a particular individual of that class. It is generally given as a [[quantification rule]] for the [[universal quantifier]] but it can also be encoded in an [[axiom]]. It is one of the basic principles used in [[quantification theory]].

Example: "All dogs are mammals. Fido is a dog. Therefore Fido is a mammal."

In symbols the rule as an [[axiom schema]] is
: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \, A(x) \Rightarrow A(a/x),&lt;/math&gt;
for some term ''a'' and where &lt;math&gt;A(a/x)&lt;/math&gt; is the result of [[substitution (logic)|substituting]] ''a'' for all ''free'' occurrences of ''x'' in ''A''. &lt;math&gt;\, A(a/x)&lt;/math&gt; is an '''instance''' of &lt;math&gt;\forall x \, A(x).&lt;/math&gt;

And as a rule of inference it is
:from ⊢ ∀''x'' ''A'' infer ⊢ ''A''(''a''/''x''),
with ''A''(''a''/''x'') the same as above.

[[Irving Copi]] noted that universal instantiation "...[[logical consequence|follows from]] variants of rules for '[[natural deduction]]', which were devised independently  by [[Gerhard Gentzen]] and [[Stanisław Jaśkowski]] in 1934." &lt;ref&gt;Copi, Irving M. (1979). ''Symbolic Logic'', 5th edition, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quine ==
According to [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], universal instantiation and [[existential generalization]] are two aspects of a single principle, for instead of saying that "∀''x''&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''" implies "Socrates&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Socrates", we could as well say that the denial "Socrates&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;Socrates" implies "∃''x''&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''x''". The principle embodied in these two operations is the link between [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]]s and the singular statements that are related to them as instances. Yet it is a principle only by courtesy. It holds only in the case where a term names and, furthermore, occurs [[Reference#Semantics|referentially]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Willard Van Orman Quine |author1-link=Willard Van Orman Quine|author2=Roger F.

The '''XML Metadata Interchange''' ('''XMI''') is an [[Object Management Group|Object Management Group (OMG)]] standard for exchanging [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] information via [[Extensible Markup Language|Extensible Markup Language (XML)]].

It can be used for any metadata whose metamodel can be expressed in [[Meta-Object Facility|Meta-Object Facility (MOF)]].

The most common use of XMI is as an interchange format for [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] models, although it can also be used for serialization of models of other languages (metamodels).

== Overview ==
In the [[Object Management Group|OMG]] vision of modeling, data is split into abstract models and concrete models. The abstract models represent the semantic information, whereas the concrete models represent visual diagrams. Abstract models are instances of arbitrary MOF-based modeling languages such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] or [[SysML]]. For diagrams, the Diagram Interchange (DI, XMI[DI]) standard is used. At the moment there are several incompatibilities between different modeling tool vendor implementations of XMI, even between interchange of abstract model data. The usage of Diagram Interchange is almost nonexistent. This means exchanging files between [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] modeling tools using XMI is rarely possible.

One purpose of XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) is to enable easy interchange of metadata between UML-based modeling tools and MOF-based metadata repositories in distributed heterogeneous environments.  XMI is also commonly used as the medium by which models are passed from modeling tools to software generation tools as part of [[model-driven engineering]].

== Integration of industry standards ==
XMI integrates four industry standards:
* [[Xml|XML]] – Extensible Markup Language, a [[W3c|W3C]] standard.
* [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] – Unified Modeling Language, an [[Object Management Group|OMG]] modeling standard.
* [[Meta-Object Facility|MOF]] – Meta Object Facility, an [[Object Management Group|OMG]] language for specifying [[Metamodeling|metamodels]].
* MOF – Mapping to XMI

The integration of these four standards into XMI allows tool developers of distributed systems to share object models and other metadata.

Several versions of XMI have been created: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, 2.1, 2.1.1, 2.4, 2.4.1, 2.4.2. and 2 5.1. The 2.x versions are radically different from the 1.x series.

There are now other XML standards for representing [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]].  One of the most recent is the [[Web Ontology Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]] (but ontologies are a very specialized kind of metadata, and OWL has no built-in support for most of the information represented in UML).  OWL is built upon the [[Resource Description Framework|Resource Description Framework (RDF)]].

The Diagram Definition OMG project is another alternative, which can also express the layout and graphical representation.&lt;ref name="DD"&gt;{{cite web|author=OMG|title=Diagram Definition, Version 1.0|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/1.0/|date=2012-07-01|accessdate = 2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yusnier Viera''' (born April 26, 1982) is a [[Cuban American]] [[mental calculator]]. He is well known as "The Human Calendar" for his world record on calendar dates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recordholders.org/en/records/dates.html Calendar Calculation World Records ]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2005 he broke for first time the [[World Record]] for calendar calculations. At the [[Mental Calculation World Cup]] in 2010 he won the calendar category. He currently has three [[World Records]] for calendar calculations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaheadlines.com/young_cuban_fourth_in_mental_calculus_olympiad.html_0 Young cuban fourth in mental calculus olympiad]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaheadlines.com/cuban_prodigy_up_for_another_guinness_record.html Cuban prodigy up for another Guinness Record]&lt;/ref&gt;

Viera has appeared in prestigious TV channels like [[CNN]] &amp; ABC and has starred on the international Discovery Channel Series [https://web.archive.org/web/20121110011336/http://www.questtv.co.uk/superhuman-showdown/episodes-brain "Superhuman Showdown"] ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOUWdqtxxS8 trailer]). In early 2014, he participated in the Latin American show "Super Cerebros", of [[National Geographic Channel|NatGeo]]. He won the first round and four thousand five hundred dollars of cash prize, reaching the final round of the show.

Due to his extraordinary skills, University of Sussex neuroscientists took fMRI scans of his brain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents/?id=21093 Maths experts are “made, not born”, Sussex study shows]&lt;/ref&gt; In the study, he also completed a computerized version of the Raven's Progressive Matrices Test with an IQ score of 157 (standard deviation of 15). The scientists concluded that his expertise is a result of long-term practice and motivation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073746 Effective Connectivity Reveals Strategy Differences in an Expert Calculator]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2016, Yusnier participated in the Fox show "Superhumans" where he showed a new skill called "flash math". Later, he was invited to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48SgxnCc58c "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" ] for an impressive demonstration.

Recently, he published the books ''Basic Course of Mental Arithmetic'' and ''Master the Multiplication Tables''.&lt;ref name="books"/&gt;

'''Zoia Ceaușescu''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈzoja tʃe̯a.uˈʃesku}}, 28 February 1949 – 20 November 2006) was a Romanian [[mathematician]], the daughter of Communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] and his wife, [[Elena Ceaușescu|Elena]].

==Biography==

She studied at High School nr. 24 (now Jean Monnet High School) in Bucharest, finishing in 1966. She then continued her studies at the Faculty of Mathematics, [[University of Bucharest]]. After completing her [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics, she worked as a researcher at the [[Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy]] in Bucharest. Her field of specialization was [[functional analysis]]. Allegedly, her parents were unhappy with their daughter's choice of doing research in mathematics, so the Institute was disbanded in 1975. She moved on to work for Institutul pentru Creație Științifică și Tehnică (INCREST, Institute for Scientific and Technical Creativity), where she eventually started and headed a new department of mathematics. In 1976, Ceausesca received the '''[[Simion Stoilow Prize]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37513025|title=Recognizing excellence in the mathematical sciences : an international compilation of awards, prizes, and recipients|date=1997|publisher=JAI Press|others=Jaguszewski, Janice M.|isbn=0762302356|location=Greenwich, Conn.|oclc=37513025}}&lt;/ref&gt; for her outstanding contributions to the mathematical sciences.

She was married in 1980 to Mircea Oprean, an engineer and professor at the [[Polytechnic University of Bucharest]].

During the [[Romanian Revolution]], on 24 December 1989 she was arrested for "undermining the Romanian economy" and was released only eight months later, on 18 August 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Oana Dobre, [http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/420087/Invinsa-de-cancer/ "Invinsǎ de cancer"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520181515/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/420087/Invinsa-de-cancer/ |date=20 May 2009 }}, ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', 22 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After she was freed, she tried unsuccessfully to return to her former job at INCREST, then gave up and retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Camelia Onciu, [http://www.monitorulsb.ro/cms/site/m_sb/news/sub_povara_numelui_4967.html "Sub povara numelui"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929171648/http://www.monitorulsb.ro/cms/site/m_sb/news/sub_povara_numelui_4967.html |date=29 September 2007 }}, ''Monitorul de Sibiu'', 22 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After the revolution, some newspapers reported that she had lived a wild life, having plenty of lovers and often being drunk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-10/news/mn-364_1_zoia-ceausescu "Wild Life of Ceaușescu's Daughter Bared"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 10 January 1990, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

After her parents were executed, the new government confiscated the house where she and her husband lived (the house was used as proof of allegedly stolen wealth), so she had to live with friends.

After the revolution that ousted her parents, Zoia reported that during her parents' time in power her mother had asked the [[Securitate]] to keep an eye on the Ceaușescu children, perhaps she felt, out of a "sense of love".&lt;ref&gt;''The rise and fall of Ceaușescu'', a BBC Television Production written and presented by [[Edward Behr (journalist)|Edward Behr]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  The Securitate "could not touch" the children she said, but the information they provided created a lot of problems for the children.&lt;ref&gt;''The rise and fall of Ceaușescu'', a BBC Television Production written and presented by [[Edward Behr (journalist)|Edward Behr]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  She also remarked that power had a "destructive effect" on her father and that he "lost his sense of judgment".&lt;ref&gt;''The rise and fall of Ceaușescu'', a BBC Television Production written and presented by [[Edward Behr (journalist)|Edward Behr]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoia Ceaușescu believed that her parents were not buried in [[Ghencea Cemetery]]; she attempted to have their remains exhumed, but a military court refused her request.

Zoia was known to be an [[Chain smoking|inveterate smoker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/invinsa-de-cancer-420087.html "o fumătoare înrăită"] ("An inveterate smoker")&lt;/ref&gt; She died of lung cancer in 2006, at age 57.
