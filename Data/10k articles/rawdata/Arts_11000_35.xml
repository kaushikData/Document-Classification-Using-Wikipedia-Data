'''''A Garden of Glass''''' refers to a [[stained glass window]] in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam]], designed and installed for the [[silver jubilee]] of [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] in 2005, by the artist Marc Mulders.

In 2004 the National Committee for the Silver Jubilee of Queen Beatrix was formed.&lt;ref name="overheid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0016368/2004-02-18|title=Regeling - Instellingsbesluit Nationaal Comité Zilveren Regeringsjubileum Koningin Beatrix - BWBR0016368|website=wetten.overheid.nl|accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee settled on a stained glass window in the Nieuwe Kerk as a fitting memorial as that is the location where the Queen was inaugurated.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2005/04/29/ramen-mulders-tekenen-onze-tijd-10488593-a146729 "Ramen Mulders tekenen onze tijd"], ''[[NRC Handelsblad|nrc.nl]]'', 29 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The window is made up of 40 individual panels that include various mushrooms, flowers and butterflies.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; It hangs opposite the commemorative window from 1995 celebrating 50 years of freedom.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; A book was published the same year by Lien Heyting about the window, explaining the symbolism of the various figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tuin-van-glas-herdenkingsraam-zilveren-regeringsjubileum-koningin-beatrix-2005/oclc/993519991 Een tuin van glas herdenkingsraam Zilveren Regeringsjubileum Koningin Beatrix 2005], on [[worldcat]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year Marc Mulders made a stained-glass window commemorating the re-opening of [[Museum Catharijneconvent]] with the theme [[Apocalypse]] and on 2 September 2016 he made a stained-glass window commemorating [[Erasmus]] which was installed in the [[Janskerk, Gouda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintjan.com/het-erasmusglas-van-marc-mulders/ Het Erasmusglas van Marc Mulders], church website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of [[A Course in Miracles]]''''' (1992) is the first book by author [[Marianne Williamson]] and a [[The New York Times Best Sellers List|''New York Times'' Best seller]].

==Exposure==
''A Return to Love'' spent 39 weeks on the New York Times best sellers list in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BEST SELLERS: November 29, 1992|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/29/books/best-sellers-november-29-1992.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 29, 1992|accessdate=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, ''A Return to Love'' was credited as being one of the two books that helped bring [[New Age]] perspectives to the American mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA319870.html?pubdate=9%2F1%2F2003&amp;display=archive ''Publisher's Weekly'' September 1, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty years after her first appearance with the book, Williamson was interviewed again by Oprah Winfrey in July 2012, this time in a ''[[Super Soul Sunday]]'' (OWN TV) episode titled, "20 Years After A Return to Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Oprah and Marianne Williamson: 20 Years After A Return to Love |publisher=OWN TV, Super Soul Sunday | url = http://www.oprah.com/own-super-soul-sunday/Full-Episode-Oprah-and-Marianne-Williamson-Video |date=July 29, 2012|accessdate = 2013-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Todd Carroll]], of ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'', writes, "Williamson might be called Oprah's patron saint. She's all about love and healing, yin and yang, being wounded, and using love and prayer to heal all wounds. ''A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of A Course In Miracles'' (1992) was number one on the ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' non-fiction best-sellers list for 11 weeks. Williamson promoted her book and ACIM when she appeared on the ''Oprah Winfrey Show'', an episode that received more pro viewer mail than any other show for 1992. She also spoke of the book, and the course when she was interviewed by [[Barbara Walters]] on the ABC television news show [[20/20 (US television series)|''20/20'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/cim.html#*** ''Skeptics Dictionary'' ACIM listing] Retrieved June 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1300">In [[painting]], a '''retarder''' is a substance, usually added to [[water]], used to slow the drying time of [[acrylic paints]], giving more time for [[Mixing (process engineering)|blending]] or [[layering]] [[Specular highlight|highlights]].

==Use in fine art==
Retarders are used to counter the fast drying properties of acrylic paints making possible the usage of wet on wet or other techniques which would otherwise require oil paints. Even if they will never give acrylic the working time oil paints permits, depending how much it is adding to paint, they can give anywhere from half an hour to a full day's working time.

==Content==
They generally contain glycol (such as [[propylene glycol]]) or glycerin-based additives.

== Home-Made ==
For home-made acrylic retarder, water [[glycerol]] down about 5:1 (water: glycerol) and apply to paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paintingclinic.com/clinic/guestarticles/retarder.htm |title=Home Made Acrylic Retarders |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515215304/http://www.paintingclinic.com/clinic/guestarticles/retarder.htm |archive-date=15 May 2013 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-toxic car anti-freeze, which contains propylene glycol can also be used.

The '''album-equivalent unit''' is a measurement unit in [[music industry]] to define the consumption of music that equals the purchase of one [[album]] copy.&lt;ref name="pitchfork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BillboardRule"/&gt; This consumption includes [[streaming media|streaming]] and [[music download|song downloads]] in addition to traditional [[album sales]]. The album-equivalent unit was introduced in the mid-[[2010s]] as an answer to the drop of album sales in the 21st century. Album sales more than halved from 1999 to 2009, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Album Sales Are Down|url=http://www.speeli.com/articles/view/Why-album-sales-are-down|website=Speeli|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the only albums that [[Music_recording_certification|went platinum]] in the United States in 2014 were the ''[[Frozen (soundtrack)|Frozen]]'' soundtrack and [[Taylor Swift]]'s [[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|''1989'']], whereas several artists did in 2013.&lt;ref name="noplat"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2014/10/16/not-one-artists-album-has-gone-platinum-in-2014/ |title=Not One Artist's Album Has Gone Platinum In 2014 |last=McIntyre |first=Hugh |date=October 16, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |publisher=Forbes, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Sam|title=Taylor Swift, Platinum Party of One|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/11/05/361577726/taylor-swift-platinum-party-of-one|website=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the album-equivalent units revolutionized the charts from the "best-selling albums" ranking into the "most popular albums" ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7393605/drakes-views-no-1-fifth-week-billboard-200|title=Drake's 'Views' Rules at No. 1 for Fifth Week on Billboard 200 Chart|first=Keith|last=Caulfield|work=Billboard|date=May 22, 2016|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) have used album-equivalent unit to measure their [[Global Recording Artist of the Year]] since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/global-artist-chart.php|title=Global Recording Artist of the Year|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses on record charts==
=== United States ===
Beginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart revised its ranking methodology with album-equivalent unit instead of pure album sales. With this overhaul, the ''Billboard'' 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by [[Nielsen SoundScan]]) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services including [[Spotify]], [[Apple Music]], [[Google Play]] and [[Xbox Music]]. Known as TEA (track equivalent album) and SEA (streaming equivalent album) when originally implemented, 10 song sales or 1,500 song streams from an album were treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. ''Billboard'' continues to publish a pure album sales chart, called [[Top Album Sales]], that maintains the traditional ''Billboard'' 200 methodology, based exclusively on Nielsen SoundScan's sales data.&lt;ref name="BillboardRule"&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Trust|title=Billboard 200 Makeover: Album Chart to Incorporate Streams &amp; Track Sales|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6320099/billboard-200-makeover-streams-digital-tracks|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2014-11-20|accessdate=2014-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor Swift's ''1989'' was the first album to top the chart with this methodology, generating 339,000 album-equivalent units (281,000 units came from pure album sales).&lt;ref name="pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6334866/taylor-swift-1989-returns-no-1-billboard-200 |title=Taylor Swift's '1989' Returns to No. 1 on Revamped Billboard 200|work=billboard.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/589-why-is-taylor-swift-still-1-interpreting-the-revamped-billboard-200-album-chart/ |title=Why Is Taylor Swift Still #1?|work=pitchfork.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the February 8, 2015 issue, ''[[Now That's What I Call Music! 53 (U.S. series)|Now That's What I Call Music! 53]]'' became the first album in history to miss the top position of the ''Billboard'' 200 despite being the best-selling album of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/28306/20150212/now-53-outsells-taylor-swift-becomes-first-record-top-albums-kid-ink.htm|title=Now 53 Outsells Taylor Swift, Becomes First Record to Top Albums Chart but Not Billboard 200; Kid Ink Cracks Top 10|first=Ryan|last=Book|date=February 12, 2015|work=The Music Times|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2018, Billboard and Nielsen revised the ratios used for streaming equivalent album units to account for the relative value of streams on paid music services like Apple Music or Amazon Music Unlimited versus ad-supported music and video platforms such as Spotify's free tier and YouTube. Under the updated album equivalent ratios, 1,250 premium audio streams, 3,750 ad-supported streams, or 3,750 video streams are equal to one album unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/arts/music/drake-scorpion-streams-billboard-chart.html|title=The Music Industry’s Math Changes, but the Outcome Doesn’t: Drake Is No. 1|first=Ben|last=Sisario|date=July 9, 2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the [[Official Charts Company]] has included streaming into the [[UK Albums Chart]] since March 2015.&lt;ref name="Sam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6487512/sam-smiths-in-the-lonely-hour-tops-historic-uk-albums-chart |title=Sam Smith's 'In the Lonely Hour' Tops Historic U.K. Albums Chart|work=billboard.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change was decided after the massive growth of streaming; the number of tracks streamed in the UK in a year doubled from 7.5 billion in 2013 to just under 15 billion in 2014. Under the new methodology, Official Charts Company takes the 12 most-streamed tracks from an album, with the top two songs being given lesser weight so that the figure will reflect the popularity of the album as a whole rather than of one or two successful [[single (music)|singles]]. The adjusted total is divided by 1000 and added to the album sales figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/uk-s-official-albums-chart-to-include-streaming-data-for-first-time__8012/ |title=Official Albums Chart to include streaming data for first time|work=officialcharts.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]]'s ''[[In the Lonely Hour]]'' was the first album to top the chart with this rule. Out of its 41,000 album-equivalent units, 2,900 units came from streaming and the rest were pure sales.&lt;ref name="Sam"/&gt; By the end of 2017, The BPI reported that streaming now accounts for over half of music consumption in the UK (50.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/drakes-official-top-40-most-streamed-songs__21625/|title=Drake's Official Top 40 most streamed songs|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In Germany, streaming began to be included on the albums chart since February 2016. Nevertheless, [[German Albums Chart]] is used to ranking the albums based on weekly [[revenue]], instead of units. Hence, only paid streaming is counted and should be played at least 30 seconds. At least 6 tracks of one album have to be streamed to make streams count for the album, with 12 tracks being the maximum counted. Similar to the UK chart rule, the actual streams of the top-two songs are not counted, but instead the average of the following tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikmarkt.de/Aktuell/News/Deutsche-Album-Charts-integrieren-Premium-Streaming|archive-url=https://archive.is/20160201142531/http://www.musikmarkt.de/Aktuell/News/Deutsche-Album-Charts-integrieren-Premium-Streaming|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 1, 2016|publisher=Musikmarkt.de|language=German|title=Deutsche Album-Charts integrieren Premium-Streaming|date=February 1, 2016|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Deutsche-Album-Charts-jetzt-auch-mit-Streaming-Zahlen-3089360.html|title=Deutsche Album-Charts jetzt auch mit Streaming-Zahlen|first=Volker|last=Briegleb|date=February 1, 2016|publisher=[[Heinz Heise]]|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes.com]], Hugh McIntyre noted that the usage of album equivalent units has made artists release albums with excessive track lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2017/08/17/how-longer-albums-and-streaming-giants-are-manipulating-the-charts/2/#69d2965051b3|title=How Longer Albums And Streaming Giants Are Manipulating The Charts|publisher=Forbes|date=2017-08-17|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Josephs from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said: "If you’re a thirsty pop artist of note, you can theoretically game the system by packing as many as 20 tracks into an album, in the process rolling up more album-equivalent units—and thus album "sales"—as listeners check the album out." He also criticized [[Chris Brown]]'s album ''[[Heartbreak on a Full Moon]]'' which contains over 40 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/05/chris-brown-new-album-40-song-tracklist-heartbreak-on-a-full-moon/|title=Why Does Chris Brown’s New Album Have 40 Songs?|date=2017-05-02|publisher=Spin|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allies and Morrison''' is an architecture and urban planning practice based in London and Cambridge. Founded in 1984, the practice is now one of Britain's largest architectural firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aj100.architectsjournal.co.uk/view/overview/2016/view.aspx |title=AJ100 |publisher=Aj100.architectsjournal.co.uk |date=2012-11-16 |accessdate=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice's work ranges from architecture and interior design to conservation and renovation of historic buildings to urbanism, planning, consultation and research. The firm's notable projects include the redevelopment of the [[Royal Festival Hall]], the masterplan for the [[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park]], [[BBC Media Village]] and the redevelopment of [[King's Cross Central]]. The practice has a reputation for designing modernist, yet stylistically restrained buildings.&lt;ref name="Worsely"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Worsely|first1=Giles|title=An empire built on subtlety|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3619436/An-empire-built-on-subtlety.html|accessdate=15 August 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=23 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have completed projects throughout the UK, and in Ireland, India, Africa and the Middle East and in North America. The practice's portfolio includes cultural, educational, public and housing projects.

'''Alva Lundin''' (née Lindbohm;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.svenskfilmdatabas.se/en/item/?type=person&amp;itemid=58000#biography|title=Alva Lundin – The Swedish Film Database|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born May 11, 1889, died February 1972) was a Swedish [[Intertitle|title card]] and credit designer and artist. Lundin began writing title cards when title cards first came to [[Sweden]] in 1919, several years after using title cards became common practice in the [[Hollywood]] film industry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lundin has been regarded as a leader in the writing of title cards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Götz|first=Stefanie|date=Summer 2010|title=Mehr als Diven|url=|journal=Film-Dienst|volume=63|pages=47|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Born in Kvillinge, [[Östergötland]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in 1889, Lundin moved to [[Stockholm]] after the death of her father.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/alva-lundin/|title=Alva Lundin – Women Film Pioneers Project|website=wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1904 to 1906, Lundin attended the female section of Tekniska Skolan, later renamed the [[Konstfack|University College of Arts, Crafts, and Design]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where she studied a variety of drawing and design techniques.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This was during a time when attending art school as a woman in Sweden was an accepted but uncommon occurrence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following her studies, Lundin worked as an illustrator and calligrapher at AB Hasse W. Tullberg.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is likely here that she would have met Sven Lundin, who she married in 1915.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After their marriage, the couple started their own business called Lundins Ritbyrå (Lundin’s Drawing Company).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sven worked as the administrator while Alva worked as the artist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Career ==
The transition to the use of title cards has been regarded as what ultimately elevated films from the status of primitivity, contributing what Katherine Nagels called "key visuotextual elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nagels|first=Katherine|date=November 2012|title=Those funny subtitles’: Silent film intertitles in exhibition and discourse|url=|journal=Early Popular Visual Culture|volume=10|pages=367–382|via=Ebsco Host}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lundin's career as a title card writer (1919-1960)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; has been identified as beginning with the film ''[[Sir Arne's Treasure]]'' (''[[Sir Arne's Treasure|Herr Arnes pengar]]'')&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in 1919&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; with [[SF Studios|Svensk Filmindustri]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Her success in that role lead to her continuance with [[SF Studios|Svensk Filmindustri]] with increased responsibilities in the making of the 1920 film ''[[Erotikon (1920 film)|Erotikon]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nordicwomeninfilm.com/alva-gick-fore-och-filmtextade/?lang=sv|title=Alva gick före och filmtextade|website=www.nordicwomeninfilm.com|language=sv|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lundin's title cards followed the popularly used sequence for title cards of the time, and yet her work has been regarded as prolific, and she herself as the "Nestor of Swedish film calligraphers".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The effectiveness of Lundin's title cards have been regarded as contributing significantly to the viewers understanding, while simultaneously enhancing the humour of the film.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1924, ''Filmnyheter'' proclaimed Lundin to be "the only [Swedish] film title specialist",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a remarkable title to hold as a woman during a period when her presence in the industry was an anomaly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Women artists in Sweden who were able to support themselves with their art were generally illustrators for children's books.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1927 Lundin began signing her cards AL.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Over her forty year career, Lundin was credited as the title designer for 16 films, and contributed to nearly 500 films overall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''And the Sea Will Tell''''' is a [[true crime]] book by [[Vincent Bugliosi]] and [[Bruce Henderson (author)|Bruce Henderson]]. The nonfiction book recounts a double murder on [[Palmyra Atoll]]; the subsequent arrest, trial and conviction of Duane ("Buck") Walker; and the acquittal of his girlfriend, Stephanie Stearns, whom Bugliosi and [[Leonard Weinglass]] defended. The book went to No. 1 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' hardcover bestseller list in March 1991 and is still in print as a trade paperback and ebook.

==The killings==
In 1974, a yachting couple from [[San Diego, California]],  Malcolm "Mac" Graham III, 43, and Eleanor LaVerne "Muff" Graham, 40, sailed a 38-foot [[ketch]] to [[Palmyra Atoll]]&amp;nbsp;— 1,200 miles south of Honolulu&amp;nbsp;— hoping to find it deserted and to pass an idyllic year or more there. The wealthy Grahams overcame their disappointment at finding other sailors already on Palmyra, including two male Canadian scientists. The couple found the two men amiable and intelligent, and stayed.

Also on Palmyra were Wesley G. Walker (a.k.a. Buck Walker) and Stephanie Stearns (referred to as "Jennifer Jenkins" in the book), who had sailed there together from [[Hawaii]] on Stearns' sailing vessel ''Iola'', a deteriorating, patched-together wooden [[sloop]] that lacked a reliable auxiliary engine. In contrast, the Grahams' ketch, the ''Sea Wind'', was beautifully finished and impeccably outfitted, with an onboard machine shop equipped with a [[lathe]] and [[acetylene]] [[welding]] [[torch]].

Walker was an ex-convict fleeing a drug possession charge and had come up with the idea of growing [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] on Palmyra to support himself.  The Grahams were a happily married couple touring the world, and Mr. Graham ran his business remotely.  The Grahams had brought more than a year's supply of food for their voyage, but Walker and Stearns quickly consumed their own meager supplies and resorted to harvesting the island's few coconuts, often by chopping down entire trees, leaving scars on the island habitat. As Walker's method of farming became unsustainable, he and Stearns were forced to plan a voyage in the rickety ''Iola'', against prevailing winds and currents, to Fanning ([[Tabuaeran]]), a nearby atoll in [[Kiribati]], to restock&amp;nbsp;— a voyage that was somewhere between difficult and impossible without a working auxiliary engine.

According to Stearns, the Grahams disappeared sometime between August 28 and August 30, 1974, and the young couple found the Grahams' [[Zodiac Nautic|Zodiac]] rigid inflatable [[dinghy]] upside down. On September 11, 1974, after days of searching and waiting for the Grahams to return to their boat, Stearns said she and Walker scuttled the ''Iola'' and sailed for Hawaii on the ''Sea Wind''. Once in Hawaii, the couple had the ''Sea Wind'' repainted and also renamed it, which according to boating superstition brings bad luck. This act aroused suspicion; acquaintances of the Grahams easily recognized the distinctive ''Sea Wind'' despite its new paint job. Stearns was arrested in the lower level of the Hawaii Yacht Club for the theft of the ''Sea Wind'',&lt;ref name="San Diego Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bell|first1=Diane|title=1974 murder victim still awaits burial|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/lifestyle/people/sdut-murder-trial-bugliosi-graham-sailboat-palmyra-fbi-2014apr18-story.html|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Walker was able to escape and avoid capture by using a motorized dinghy to race up the "400 row" of the [[Ala Wai Harbor]].  It was believed he fled on foot after leaving the dinghy at the loading dock near the [[The Ilikai|Ilikai Hotel]].

Early one morning in 1981, other visitors to Palmyra, sailors Robert and Sharon Jordan, from [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], found Muff Graham's skull and other skeletal remains in the surf near a large metal container. The remains showed signs of dismemberment and burning (possibly by Mac Graham's acetylene welding torch), and the body appeared to have been concealed underwater in the container.

==Trial and punishment==
Buck Walker was tried and convicted of Muff Graham's murder. He was incarcerated at [[United States Penitentiary, Victorville]], in California.  Although Walker never testified, the defense claimed that he and Stearns were attempting to return the ''Sea Wind'' to Hawaii with the ''Iola'' in tow, but the ''Iola'' ran aground on the reef as they exited the lagoon and had to be abandoned.  During the voyage back to Hawaii, it was claimed that a large [[swordfish]] damaged the ''Sea Wind''{{'}}s hull below the waterline, necessitating her repair and subsequent repainting and renaming.

Stephanie Stearns was tried separately in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. After Bugliosi argued that Buck Walker had committed the Palmyra murders himself without Stearns' participation or knowledge, and following her testimony at the trial, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.

==Aftermath==
The book was adapted into the 1991 [[television film]] ''And the Sea Will Tell'', directed by [[Tommy Lee Wallace]] which aired on [[CBS]] As a 4-hour film (Part 1 aired on February 24, and Part 2 was aired 2 days later on the 26th that month.)

The trial lawyer who represented Walker, Earle Partington, sued Bugliosi for defamation, claiming that both the book and the docudrama portrayed Partington in a negative light. The court found for Bugliosi, ruling that this was his protected opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0199342520|title=A Guide to Oral History and the Law|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker was released on parole in September 2007 at the age of 69, after serving 22 years of a life sentence, and died of a [[stroke]] on April 26, 2010 at the age of 72.&lt;ref name="Willits News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Linda|title=Notorious atoll murderer dies after parole to Willits area|url=http://www.willitsnews.com/article/zz/20100609/NEWS/100607291|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=Willits News|date=9 June 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to his death, Walker had been living in a trailer home in [[Willits, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2010/Jun/02/ln/hawaii6020337.html | title = 'Buck' Walker infamous for high-profile Palmyra deaths | author = Mary Vorsino | publisher = HonoluluAdvertiser.com | date = June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walker (writing as Wesley G.

The '''art world''' comprises everyone involved in producing, commissioning, presenting, [[Historic preservation|preserving]], promoting, chronicling, [[Art criticism|criticizing]], and selling [[fine art]].  

==Descriptions==
''Art world'' is indeed a wider term than [[art market]], though that is a large part of it.  [[Howard S. Becker]] describes it as "the network of people whose cooperative activity, organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produce(s) the kind of art works that art world is noted for" (Becker, 1982). In her book, ''Seven Days in the Art World'', Sarah Thornton describes it as "a loose network of overlapping subcultures held together by a belief in art. They span the globe but [[Art cluster|cluster]] in art capitals like New York, London, Los Angeles, and Berlin."&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;Thornton 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities sometimes called "art capitals" include Beijing, Brussels, Hong Kong, Miami, Paris, Rome and Tokyo; due to their large art festivals, followings, and being the centers of art production.{{citation needed (lead)|date=August 2016}}

The notion of the singular ''art world'' is problematic, since Becker &lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;[[Howard S. Becker|Becker, Howard S.]] ''Art Worlds''. [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]: [[University of California]] Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-520-05218-8}}. Cited in Sanjeck (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and others show art worlds are, instead, independent multiplicities scattered worldwide that are always in flux: there is no "center" to the art world any more. In her analysis of the "net art world" (referring to network-aided art or [[net art]]), Amy Alexander states "net.art had a movement, at the very least it had coherence, and although it aimed to subvert the art world, eventually its own sort of art world formed around it. It developed a culture, hype and mystique through lists and texts; it had a centre, insiders, outsiders, even nodes.  This is of course not a failure; this is unavoidable: groups form; even anarchism is an institution." &lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;Alexander, Amy. ''net art history'' (2001) [http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0102/msg00223.html Nettime.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
Art worlds exist at local and regional levels, as hidden or obscured subcultures, via primary and secondary art markets, through gallery circuits, around design movements, and, esoterically, as shared or perceived experiences. 

The one globalized, all-encompassing art world exists only as myth; rather, there are multiplicities of intersecting, overlapping, self-similar art worlds, each expressing different views of the world as they see it.

''[[Whitehot Magazine]]'' artist/publisher [[Noah Becker]] has published over 3500 articles about the Art World."&lt;ref&gt; Becker, Noah. [http://Whitehotmagazine.com His art magazine called Whitehot Magazine has taken the top spot as one of the only art magazines left in the world. &lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Magazine]]'' art critic [[Jerry Saltz]] has referred to [[William Powhida]]'s and Jade Townsend's drawing ''Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville'' as "a great big art-world stinkbomb."&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Jerry. [http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/03/saltz_william_powhida_is_makin.html "William Powhida Is Making Fun of Me, And I Love It"]. ''New York Magazine''. 9 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--  This is misleading nonsense as written
==Theory==
The term "art world" is  a product of the Institutional [[theory of art]]. It originates with the [[theorн of American art|theories of American art]] critic and [[philosopher]] [[Arthur Danto]]. In 1964 Danto published an essay "The Artworld," in which the term "artworld" was coined, meaning cultural context or "an atmosphere of art theory".&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/art-definition/&lt;/ref&gt; It has had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and, according to professor of philosophy Stephen David Ross, "especially upon [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]'s institutional theory of art." Dickie defines an art work as an artefact "which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld)" (p. 43.)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vDdZNwTmEqUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=danto&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The central core of Danto’s "The Artworld" is "artistic theory", which elevates things to the world of art (or art world). 

Danto writes: "these days one might not be aware he was on artistic terrain without an artistic theory to tell him so. And part of the reason for this lies in the fact that terrain is constituted artistic in virtue of artistic theories, so that one use of theories, in addition to helping us discriminate art from the rest, consists in making art possible" (Danto, The Artworld, p. 3).--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6902">[[File:Battistero di San Giovanni Ascoli Piceno.jpg|thumb|Ascoli Piceno Baptistery]]
The '''Ascoli Piceno Baptistery''' (Italian: ''Il battistero di San Giovanni di [[Ascoli Piceno]]''), also known as the [[baptistery]] of Saint John, is a religious building found on the eastern end of the [[piazza Arringo]] at the center of Ascoli Piceno and sitting next to and just north of the [[Ascoli Piceno Cathedral|cathedral dedicated to St. Emygdius]], the city's [[patron saint]].

The structure, simple and austere in its architectural form, perfectly represents the Romanesque style in Ascoli, and, being ranked among the best examples of Italian works of art, is included in the list of Italian [[national monument]]s &lt;small&gt;(r.d. n.7033 del 20/07/1890)&lt;/small&gt;.

== History ==
The beginning of the baptistery's construction is difficult to date accurately, but archeological finds from 1828 and other excavations between 1870-1880 suggest that the interior of the structure was a pagan temple on Ascoli's forum which may have been dedicated to [[Hercules]].

According to Giambattista Carducci, the temple was used as a baptistery already by the 6th century. He also notes that its octagonal form is like the baptistery of [[Florence Baptistery|Saint John in Florence]], of the [[Arian Baptistery|Arian baptistery]] of [[Ravenna]], and of the [[Lateran Baptistery|Lateran baptistery i]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n [[Rome]] built by [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carducci|first1=Giambattista|title=Su le memorie e i monumenti di Ascoli nel Piceno|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=PBI5AAAAcAAJ|website=googlebooks|accessdate=19 November 2016|pages=88–89|date=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The baptistery's first restoration came prior to the 9th century, with interventions following in the 10th and 11th centuries as shown in the triangular decorations and the framing of the principal entrance. Most recently, the interior of the baptistery was restored in 2006.

== Architecture ==
The baptistery is constructed of large, square blocks of travertine, some of which were taken from earlier structures. Visible at the base of the eastern side are the remains of a Roman wall. It is a freestanding structure with a massive, square base containing entrances on two sides. The ''tiburio'' (the upper part of the structure designed to shape and protect the cupola within) is octagonal in shape, decorated with four small windows, and crowned with a square lantern, also containing windows to allow light inside. Each side of the ''tiburio'' is decorated with a [[blind arcade]] containing three round arches, with exception of the east facing side which contains a pair of arcades with only two arches each. All of these arcades were added during the 12th century.

The original monument had three entrances symbolizing the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] as well as [[Churches Militant, Penitent, and Triumphant|the Three Churches]]: ''the church militant'', composed of all the baptized faithful to [[Jesus|Christ]] and the [[Pope]]; ''the church penitent'', which includes all the souls in [[purgatory]] that are being prepared for heaven; and ''the church triumphant'', comprising the [[saint]]s and [[angel]]s. Today the baptistery has two entrances. The main entrance, found on [[piazza Arringo]], is flanked by two recessed rectangular forms, and the architrave above is decorated with three recessed triangles, one large triangle in the center which is marked by a wide horizontal slit, and two small ones on the sides. The other entrance faces the cathedral door known as the ''La porta della Musa'', and contains stone work from various periods, including Romanesque capitals and an bas-relief architrave that contains a knotted cord (a type of decoration that was very diffuse around the year 1000).

The interior of the baptistery has an irregular, octagonal shape, typically Roman, with [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] that correspond to the angles of the square base. The octagonal walls measure about 5,5 [[Metre|meters]] each; the dimensions of the interiore are 9,14 x 9 meters. Inside at the center of the floor, directly below the [[oculus]] of the [[Dome|cupola]], is a slightly raised circular pool, dated to the 5th or 6th century but rediscovered only in 1839, that was used by Christians for baptism by immersion. This unique spot was used for the baptism of both men and women who were assisted, respectively, by [[deacon]]s and [[deaconess]]es. On the right side is a [[baptismal font]] from the 14th or 15th century, set on top of a twisted column. On the altar is a painting of the ''Baptism of Christ'', a 16th-century oil on canvas, attributed to Venceslao Corrigioli di Reggio.

== Symbolism ==
The historian Mario Sabatucci has attributed a symbolic reading to the form of Ascoli's baptistery according to Christian doctrine. According to his interpretation, the square base represents the earth and its four elements (air, earth, fire, and water), the four points of the compass, the four seasons, and the four periods of a human life-span. The octagonal ''tiburio'' calls to mind baptism as described by St. Peter in his first letter: &lt;small&gt;(3,20-21)&lt;/small&gt; ''« while God patiently waited to receive them, in Noah's time when the ark was being built. In it only a few, that is eight souls, were saved through water. It is the baptism corresponding to this water which saves you now ... »''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The first letter of Peter|url=http://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=67&amp;bible_chapter=3|website=Catholic Online|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The round cupola, like a circle or a sphere, represents eternity and paradise.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The '''''Assumption of the Virgin''''', 1475 - 1476, is a large (228.6 x 377.2&amp;nbsp;cm) painting in [[tempera]] on wood panel by [[Francesco Botticini]]. It portrays [[Assumption of the Virgin|Mary's assumption]] and was commissioned as the [[altarpiece]] for [[San Pier Maggiore, Florence|a church]] in [[Florence]] and is now in the [[National Gallery]], London.

[[Image:Francesco Botticini - The Assumption of the Virgin.jpg|thumb|278px|right|''Assumption of the Virgin'']]

The disciples gather around Mary's lily-filled tomb with looks of amazement. There are [[donor portrait]]s of [[Matteo Palmieri]], who commissioned the work, kneeling on the left, and his wife on the right. In Heaven above, surrounded by the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|nine choirs of angels]], [[Jesus]] raises his hand in blessing to his kneeling mother.

Among the lesser angels around Jesus and Mary are [[saints]]. Together with Palmieri's poem ''La città di vita'', this mixing of saints with angels raised questions about the orthodoxy of the donor Palmieri, and possibly that of the painter Botticini himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/francesco-botticini-the-assumption-of-the-virgin Francesco Botticini, The Assumption of the Virgin; NG1126, The National Gallery, London]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Heraldic achievement}}
In [[heraldry]], an '''attitude''' is the ''position'' in which an animal, bird, fish, human or human-like being is emblazoned as a [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]], [[Supporter (heraldry)|supporter]] or [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]].  Many attitudes apply only to predatory beasts and are exemplified by the beast most frequently found in heraldry—the [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]].  Some other terms apply only to docile animals, such as the doe (usually blazoned as "hind").  Other attitudes, such as ''volant'', describe the positions of birds, mostly exemplified by the bird most frequently found in heraldry—the [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]].&lt;ref&gt;There are high unusual and unorthodox exceptions, such as the ''beaver volant'' in the coat of arms of the [[439th Troop Carrier Group]] of the [[United States Air Force]].{{cite book |title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II |page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''naiant'' (swimming), however, is usually reserved for fish but may also apply to swans, ducks or geese.  Birds are often further described by the exact position of their wings.  The term ''segreant'' is usually applied to the [[griffin]], but this approximation of ''rampant'' which is more appropriate for them has also been applied to the [[dragon]].

Additionally, there are positions applying to direction, to indicate variations from the presumed position of any charge.  Animals and animal-like creatures are presumed to be shown in profile, facing [[Escutcheon (heraldry)#Points|dexter]] (the viewer's left), and humans and human-like beings are presumed to be shown ''affronté'' (facing the viewer), unless otherwise specified in the [[blazon]].

== Positions indicating direction ==
Animals and animal-like creatures are presumed to be shown in profile facing ''dexter''. This attitude is standard unless otherwise stated in the blazon. As a warrior will usually carry a shield in the left hand, the animal shown on the shield will then face toward the knight's body. Humans and human-like beings are presumed to be shown ''affronté''. 
Note that the heraldic terms ''dexter'' ('right') and ''sinister'' ('left') represent the shield bearer's perspective, not the viewer's.
* '''To dexter''' or the viewer's left is the direction animals are presumed to face. This position is thus not specified unless necessary for clarity, as when a human or human-like being is depicted (the default position for these is "affronté") or when an animal's head and body are not turned in the same direction. 
* '''To sinister''' or '''contourné''' is said of a creature facing the viewer's right.
* '''Affronté''' is said of a creature that faces the viewer.
* '''En Arrière''' is said of a creature positioned with its back to the viewer. It is most common used of birds and insects, where the understanding is of an overhead view of the animal with its wings spread.
* '''Guardant''' or '''In Full Aspect''' indicates an animal with a body positioned sideways but with its head turned to face the viewer.
* '''Regardant''' indicates an animal with its head turned backward, as if looking over its shoulder. Unless other instructions are given, the body will face "to dexter", making the head's direction "to sinister".  
* '''In Trian Aspect''' (a rare, later 16th and 17th century heraldry term) is when the animal's head is facing at a 3/4 view to give the appearance of depth. The head will be viewed at an angle somewhere between profile and straight-on.

== Attitudes of beasts ==
Many attitudes commonly met with in heraldic rolls apply specifically to [[Carnivora|predatory beasts]], while others may be better suited to the docile animals.  These will each be discussed in detail below.  Also worth note is that a lion or other beast may additionally be described in terms of the position of its head, differently coloured parts (such as teeth, claws, tongue, etc.), or by the shape or position of its tail.  A beast may be "armed" (horns, teeth and claws) or "langued" (tongue) of a tincture, while a stag may be "attired" (antlers) or "unguled" (hooves) of a tincture. The tail may be forked (''queue fourchée'') or doubled (''double-queued'').  In addition to the below, there may be rare or arguably, not entirely standard attitudes, such as ''a snorting bison''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A beast '''rampant''' ([[Old French]]: "rearing up") is depicted in profile standing erect with forepaws raised.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the hind legs varies according to local custom: the lion may stand on both hind legs, braced wide apart, or on only one, with the other also raised to strike; the word ''rampant'' is sometimes omitted, especially in early blazon, as this is the most usual position of a carnivorous quadruped.
''Note:'' the term ''segreant'' denotes the same position, but implies a particular wing position and is only used in reference to winged quadrupeds such as [[griffin]]s and [[European dragon|dragons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Rampant is the most frequent attitude of quadrupeds, and as [[supporter (heraldry)|supporters]] they are rarely seen in any other attitude.
'''Forcené''' is the term for this position when applied to horses or [[unicorn]]s.

=== Passant ===
A beast '''passant''' ([[Old French]]: "striding") walks toward dexter (the viewer's left) with the right forepaw raised and all others on the ground.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies181&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Early heralds held that any lion in a walking position must necessarily be a "leopard", and this distinction persists in French heraldry; however, this use of the term ''leopard'' has long since been abandoned by English heralds.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; A "Lion of England" denotes a ''lion passant guardant Or'', used as an [[Augmentation of honour|augmentation]].&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies181 /&gt; [[Flag of Wales|The Welsh flag]] features a dragon passant. For stags and other deer-like beasts of chase, the term '''trippant''' is used instead of passant.

A beast '''sejant''' or '''sejeant''' ([[Middle French]]: ''seant'', "sitting") sits on his haunches, with both forepaws on the ground.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies184&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

A beast '''sejant erect''' is seated on its haunches, but with its body erect and both forepaws raised in the "rampant" position (this is sometimes termed "sejant-rampant").&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies184 /&gt;

A beast '''dormant''' ([[French language|French]]: "sleeping") is lying down with his head lowered, resting upon the forepaws, as if asleep.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies185 /&gt;  (However, perhaps counterintuitively, some sources would have the lion dormant with the eyes open.)

=== Salient ===
A beast '''salient''' ([[Latin]]: ''saliēns'', "leaping") (also '''springing''') is leaping, with both hind legs together on the ground and both forelegs together in the air.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies183 /&gt; This is a very rare position for a lion,&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies183 /&gt; but is also used of other heraldic beasts. The stag and other docile animals in this position are often termed '''springing'''. Certain smaller animals are sometimes blazoned as '''saltant''' rather than '''salient'''.

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Statant ===
A beast '''statant''' ([[Old French]]: "standing") is "standing" (in profile toward dexter), all four feet on the ground, usually with the forepaws together.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; This posture is more frequent in [[crest (heraldry)|crests]] than in charges on shields.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies183&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  In certain animals, such as bears, this may refer to an upright, bipedal position (though this position may also be referred to as '''statant erect'''), though bears blazoned as 'statant' can also be found with all four feet firmly on the ground (''e.g.'' in [http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/northumberland_74to09.html#berwick%20bc the arms] of the former borough council of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed (borough)|Berwick-upon-Tweed]]).  While ''statant'' is used in reference to predatory beasts, the more docile animals when in this position may be called '''at bay''', while such creatures ''statant guardant'' are said to be '''at gaze'''.  This is particularly true of stags (harts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles MacKinnon of Dunakin|title=The Observer's Book of Heraldry|publisher=Frederick Warne and Co|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle and rhinoceros can be shown as ''pascuant''; that is, "grazing," with head lowered to the same level as their four legs, as the head of a cow would be when eating grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Archives of South Africa: Database of the Bureau of Heraldry on registered heraldic representations|url=http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za/sm300cv/smws/sm30ddf0?20160524012500AA93E16A|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attitudes of birds ==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2017}}

Some attitudes describe the positioning of birds. The eagle is so often found ''displayed'' in early heraldry that this position came to be presumed of the eagle unless some other attitude is specified in the blazon.

The terms ''Expanded'' and ''Elevated'' or ''Abaissé'' and ''Inverted'' are similar terms often used interchangeably in heraldry but have specific meanings. There is also sometimes confusion between a ''Rising'' bird with ''Displayed'' wings and a ''Displayed'' bird. The difference is that ''Rising'' birds face either to the ''dexter'' or ''in trian aspect'' and have their feet on the ground. ''Displayed'' birds face the viewer, have their legs splayed out, and the tail is completely visible.

Several terms refer to the particular position of the wings, rather than the attitude of the bird itself.  A bird in nearly any attitude, except ''overt'', may have its wings ''displayed'' or ''addorsed''.
* '''Wings displayed''' means the bird's right wing is extended forward and its left wing extended rearward, turned so that the undersides of both wings are fully shown.
** '''displayed and Expanded''' or '''''Espanie''''' / '''''Épandre''''' ("expanded") are spread with the wing tips pointing upward.
** '''displayed and Lowered''' or '''''Abaissé''''' ("lowered") are spread with the wing tips pointing downward.
* '''Wings addorsed''' means the wings are raised and spread behind it back-to-back as if about to take flight, so that only the top of the bird's right wing shows behind the fully displayed left wing.
** '''addorsed and elevated''' are raised with the wing tips pointing upward.
** '''addorsed and inverted''' are raised with the wing tips pointing downward.

=== Displayed ===
A bird '''displayed''' is shown ''affronté'' with its head turned to dexter and wings spread to the sides to fill the area of the field.  This position is presumed of the eagle, and the symbolic use of eagles in this position was well established even before the development of heraldry, going back to [[Charlemagne]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overt ===
A bird '''Overt''' ("closed") or '''close''', the bird's equivalent of ''Statant'', is shown in profile and at rest with its feet flat on the ground and its wings folded at its sides. '''Trussed''' is the term used for domestic or game birds, implying the bird is tied up or caught in a net respectively, and is not applied to predator birds like the Eagle and Hawk. '''Perched''' is ''Overt'' while sitting atop a Charge.

=== Rising ===
A bird '''rising''', '''rizant'''&lt;ref&gt;So blazoned in the crest of Daniel Christopher Boyer.  {{citation|title=APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION OF HERALDIC REPRESENTATIONS AND OBJECTIONS THERETO, July 23, 2010|url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=128777|accessdate=2011-01-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629133420/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=128777|archivedate=June 29, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGISTRATION OF HERALDIC REPRESENTATIONS, December 24, 2010|url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=137870|accessdate=2011-01-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629133355/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=137870|archivedate=June 29, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''rousant''''' faces dexter with its head upturned, wings raised, and standing on the tips of its feet as if about to take flight. A bird rising may have its wings described as either ''displayed'' or ''addorsed'', and the wings may be further described as ''elevated'' or ''inverted''.

=== Volant ===
A bird '''volant''' faces the [[Dexter (heraldry)|''dexter'']] with its wings spread in flight (usually shown ''addorsed'' and ''elevated'') and its legs tucked under its body. '''''Volant En Arrière''''' is when the bird is shown from a top-down perspective with the head facing straight ahead, its back to the viewer, and the wings spread in flight (usually shown ''displayed'' and ''inverted''). A bird ''volant'' is considered ''in bend'' ("diagonal") as it is flying from the lower [[Sinister (heraldry)|''sinister'']] to the upper [[Dexter (heraldry)|''dexter'']] of the field.

=== Recursant ===
An eagle or hawk shown ''regardant'', like it was looking back while circling for prey. May be used for other gliding predator birds like owls.

=== Vigilant ===
A [[crane (bird)|crane]] standing on one leg (usually with a stone held in the other foot) may be called '''vigilant''' or ''in its vigilance'' (''e.g.'' Waverley Borough Council's ''Crane in its vigilance''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/weald_downs.html|title=CIVIC HERALDRY OF ENGLAND AND WALES - WEALD AND DOWNS AREA|website=www.civicheraldry.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A stone is usually shown held in the claw of the raised leg. This is as per the Bestiary myth that Cranes stayed awake by doing so. If it dozed, the Crane would supposedly drop the rock, waking itself up.

=== Vulning / In Her Piety ===
One peculiar attitude reserved only to the pelican, is the '''[[Pelican#Christianity|pelican in her piety]]'''. The heraldic pelican, one of the few female beasts in heraldry, is shown with a sharp stork-like beak, which it uses to ''vuln'' ("pierce or wound") her own breast. This is per the bestiary myth that a female pelican wounded herself thus to feed her chicks. This symbol of sacrifice carries a particular religious meaning (usually a reference to [[Christ]]'s sacrifice), and became so popular in heraldry that pelicans rarely exist in heraldry in any other position.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction is sometimes observed, however, between a pelican '''"vulning herself"''' (alone, piercing her breast) and '''"in her piety"''' (surrounded by and feeding her chicks).&lt;ref&gt;Cussans (2003), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pelican is shown exclusively in profile perched in her nest with her wings either ''Addorsed'' and ''Inverted'' (because it is not going to fly away) or ''Overt''.

== Other attitudes ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}

Few attitudes are reserved to the rarer classes of creatures, but these include ''segreant'', a term which can only apply to winged quadrupeds; ''naiant'' and ''hauriant'', terms applying principally to fish; ''glissant'' and ''nowed'', terms applying to serpents.  Serpents also sometimes appear in a circular form, biting their own tail, but this symbol, called an [[Ouroboros]], was imported ready-made into heraldry, and so it needs no term of attitude to describe it.

=== Segreant ===
A creature ''segreant'' has both forelegs raised in the air, as a beast ''rampant'', with wings ''addorsed'' and ''elevated''.  This term is reserved to winged quadrupeds (such as griffins and dragons).

=== Combatant or respectant ===
Creatures '''combatant''' are shown in profile facing each other in the ''rampant'' or ''segreant'' position, always paired and never appearing singly.  Nearly any creature can be rendered '''combatant''', although this term is usually applied to predatory beasts and mythical creatures; herbivorous animals in such a position are typically blazoned as '''respectant'''.

=== Addorsed ===
Creatures or objects '''addorsed''' or '''endorsed''' are shown facing ''away from'' each other.  As with ''combatant'', charges addorsed can only appear in pairs. One also frequently finds keys addorsed (placed in parallel, wards facing outward).

=== Naiant ===
An animal or creature '''naiant''' is swimming.  This term is typically applied to fish (when shown in a horizontal position), but may also apply to other sea creatures and, occasionally, water fowl (''i.e.'' swans, ducks or geese shown without legs). A dolphin blazoned as naiant is always shown as embowed, unlike any other sea creature or monster, even though the blazon may not specify this.

=== Hauriant ===
A fish, dolphin, or other sea creature '''hauriant''' is in a vertical position with its head up.

=== Urinant ===
A fish, dolphin, or other sea creature '''urinant''' is in a vertical position with its head down.

=== Glissant ===
A serpent '''glissant''' is gliding horizontally in an undulant posture.

=== Nowed ===
Serpents, and the tails of other beasts and monsters, may be '''nowed''' or knotted—often in a [[figure-eight knot]].

A '''backup band''' or '''backing band''' is a [[Band (music)|musical ensemble]] that [[Accompaniment|accompanies]] a [[lead singer]] at a live performance or on a [[sound recording|recording]].&lt;ref name="CampbellBrody2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Campbell|author2=James Brody|title=Rock and roll: an introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RK-JmVbv4OIC&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=14 December 2010|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-534-64295-2|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2017}} A backup band can also accompany an instrumental soloist, such as a [[lead guitarist]] or solo [[fiddler]], though [[instrumental music|all-instrumental]] performances, with no singing, are not common in [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]]. This can either be an established, long-standing group that has little or no change in membership, or it may be an [[ad hoc]] group assembled for a single show or a single recording.{{or|date=September 2017}} Ad hoc or "pickup" groups are often made up of [[session musician]]s.

[[File:Rozeta Paryż notre-dame chalger.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Rayonnant]] [[rose window]] in [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. In [[Gothic architecture]], [[light]] was considered the most beautiful revelation of [[God]], which was heralded in its design.]]

'''Beauty'''  is a property or characteristic of an [[animal]], [[idea]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], person or [[Location (geography)|place]] that provides a [[perception|perceptual]] experience of [[pleasure]] or [[Contentment|satisfaction]]. Beauty is studied as part of [[aesthetics]], [[culture]], [[social psychology]], [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]]. An "ideal beauty" is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.

[[Unattractiveness|Ugliness]] is considered to be the opposite of beauty.

The experience of "beauty" often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and [[harmony]] with [[nature]], which may lead to feelings of [[sexual attraction|attraction]] and [[emotional well-being]]. Because this can be a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] experience, it is often said that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."&lt;ref name="phrase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html|title=Beauty is in the eye of the beholder|accessdate=December 4, 2007|publisher=The Phrase Finder|year=2007|author=Gary Martin| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071130023507/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/59100.html| archivedate= November 30, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the empirical observations of things that are considered beautiful often aligning with the aforementioned nature and [[health]] thereof, beauty has been stated to have levels of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] as well.

There is also evidence that perceptions of beauty are determined by [[natural selection]]; that things, aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human's genes.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html|title=A Darwinian theory of beauty|author=|date=|website=ted.com|accessdate=May 1, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211012601/http://www.ted.com/talks/denis_dutton_a_darwinian_theory_of_beauty.html|archivedate=February 11, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek==
The classical Greek noun that best translates to the English-language words "beauty" or "beautiful" was [[wikt:κάλλος|κάλλος]], ''kallos'', and the adjective was καλός, ''kalos''. However, ''kalos'' may and is also translated as ″good″ or ″of fine quality″ and thus has a broader meaning than mere physical or material beauty. Similarly, ''kallos'' was used differently from the English word beauty in that it first and foremost applied to humans and bears an erotic connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Konstan|first1=David|title=Beauty - The Fortunes of an Ancient Greek Idea|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-992726-5|pages=30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Koine Greek]] word for beautiful was ὡραῖος, ''hōraios'',&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 23:27, Acts 3:10, Flavius Josephus, 12.65&lt;/ref&gt; an adjective etymologically coming from the word ὥρα, ''hōra'', meaning "hour". In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with "being of one's hour".&lt;ref name="Euripides, Alcestis 515"&gt;Euripides, ''Alcestis'' 515.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a ripe fruit (of its time) was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, ''hōraios'' had many meanings, including "youthful" and "ripe old age".&lt;ref name="Euripides, Alcestis 515"/&gt;

The [[Beauty (ancient thought)|earliest Western theory of beauty]] can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the [[pre-Socratic]] period, such as [[Pythagoras]]. The Pythagorean school saw a strong connection between [[mathematics]] and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the [[golden ratio]] seemed more attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Seife, Charles (2000). ''[[Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea]]''. Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-029647-6}}. p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Greek architecture]] is based on this view of symmetry and [[ratio|proportion]].

Plato considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful (''to kalon'') and virtue, arguing that "Virtue aims at the beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachean Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical philosophy]] and sculptures of men and women produced according to the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in [[Renaissance]] Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a "classical ideal". In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose [[human physical appearance|appearance]] conforms to these tenets is still called a "classical beauty" or said to possess a "classical beauty", whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty in western civilization.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later, [[Renaissance]] and [[Humanism|Humanist]] thinkers rejected this view, and considered beauty to be the product of rational order and harmonious proportions. Renaissance artists and architects (such as [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his "Lives of Artists") criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view of [[Gothic art]] lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century.

==Middle Ages==
In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Catholic philosopher|Catholic philosophers]] like [[Thomas Aquinas]] included beauty among the [[Transcendentals|transcendental]] attributes of [[being]].  In his [[Summa Theologica]], Aquinas described the three conditions of beauty as: integritas (Wholeness), consonantia (harmony), claritas (radiance of form)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1039.htm#article8 Summa Theologica, Part 1, Question 39, Article 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Gothic Architecture of the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages|Late]] [[Middle Ages]], light was considered the most beautiful revelation of [[God]], which was heralded in design.  Examples are the [[Stained glass#Medieval_glass_in_Europe|stained glass]] of Gothic [[Cathedral|Cathedrals]] including [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] and [[Chartes Cathedral]].

==The Age of Reason==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'', by [[Sandro Botticelli]]. The goddess Venus is the classical personification of beauty.]]

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] argued that beauty is "unity in variety and variety in unity".&lt;ref&gt;An Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue; In Two Treatises&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of beauty, with [[John Keats]] arguing in "Ode on a Grecian Urn" that

:  Beauty is truth, truth beauty, —that is all.
:  Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

==The Romantic period==
In the Romantic period, [[Edmund Burke]] postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==The 20th century and after==
The 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in [[postmodernism]]'s anti-aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture by Hal Foster&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.&lt;ref&gt;The Will to Power&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher [[Guy Sircello]] proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept.&lt;ref&gt;A New Theory of Beauty. Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Love and Beauty. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Elaine Scarry also argues that beauty is related to justice.&lt;ref&gt;On Beauty and Being Just&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauty is also studied by psychologists and neuroscientists in the field of [[experimental aesthetics]] and [[neuroesthetics]] respectively. Psychological theories see beauty as a form of [[pleasure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reber|first=Rolf|last2=Schwarz|first2=Norbert|last3=Winkielman|first3=Piotr|date=2004|title=Processing fluency and aesthetic pleasure: is beauty in the perceiver's processing experience?|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review: An Official Journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc|volume=8|issue=4|pages=364–382|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0804_3|issn=1088-8683|pmid=15582859|hdl=1956/594|url=http://psr.sagepub.com/content/8/4/364.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Thomas|last2=Detweiler-Bedell|first2=Brian|date=December 2008|title=Beauty as an emotion: The exhilarating prospect of mastering a challenging world.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/gpr/12/4/305/|journal=Review of General Psychology|language=English|volume=12|issue=4|pages=305–329|doi=10.1037/a0012558|issn=1939-1552|citeseerx=10.1.1.406.1825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correlational findings support the view that more beautiful objects are also more pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vartanian|first=Oshin|last2=Navarrete|first2=Gorka|last3=Chatterjee|first3=Anjan|last4=Fich|first4=Lars Brorson|last5=Leder|first5=Helmut|last6=Modroño|first6=Cristián|last7=Nadal|first7=Marcos|last8=Rostrup|first8=Nicolai|last9=Skov|first9=Martin|date=2013-06-18|title=Impact of contour on aesthetic judgments and approach-avoidance decisions in architecture|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/Supplement_2/10446|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=110|issue=Supplement 2|pages=10446–10453|doi=10.1073/pnas.1301227110|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3690611|pmid=23754408|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628045618/http://www.pnas.org/content/110/Supplement_2/10446|archivedate=June 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marin|first=Manuela M.|last2=Lampatz|first2=Allegra|last3=Wandl|first3=Michaela|last4=Leder|first4=Helmut|date=2016-11-04|title=Berlyne Revisited: Evidence for the Multifaceted Nature of Hedonic Tone in the Appreciation of Paintings and Music|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=10|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2016.00536|issn=1662-5161|pmc=5095118|pmid=27867350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brielmann|first=Aenne A.|last2=Pelli|first2=Denis G.|date=2017-05-22|title=Beauty Requires Thought|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(17)30427-X|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=27|issue=10|pages=1506–1513.e3|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.04.018|issn=0960-9822|pmid=28502660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies suggest that higher experienced beauty is associated with activity in the medial [[orbitofrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawabata|first=Hideaki|last2=Zeki|first2=Semir|date=April 2004|title=Neural correlates of beauty|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=91|issue=4|pages=1699–1705|doi=10.1152/jn.00696.2003|issn=0022-3077|pmid=15010496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishizu|first=Tomohiro|last2=Zeki|first2=Semir|date=2011-07-06|title=Toward A Brain-Based Theory of Beauty|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021852|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e21852|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021852|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3130765|pmid=21755004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830234420/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0021852|archivedate=August 30, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach of localizing the processing of beauty in one brain region has received criticism within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conway|first=Bevil R.|last2=Rehding|first2=Alexander|date=2013-03-19|title=Neuroaesthetics and the Trouble with Beauty|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001504|journal=PLOS Biology|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e1001504|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001504|issn=1545-7885|pmc=3601993|pmid=23526878|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608234118/http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001504|archivedate=June 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human beauty==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}
[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Fresco of a Roman woman from [[Pompeii]], c. 50 AD]]
The characterization of a person as “beautiful”, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of ''inner beauty'', which includes psychological factors such as [[Personality type|personality]], [[intelligence]], [[wiktionary:grace|grace]], [[politeness]], [[charisma]], [[integrity]], [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] and [[elegance]], and ''outer beauty'' (i.e. [[physical attractiveness]]) which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis.

Standards of beauty have changed over time, based on changing cultural values. Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.

A strong indicator of physical beauty is "[[averageness]]".&lt;ref name="Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990"&gt;Langlois, J.H., Roggman, L. (1990). "Attractive faces are only average." ''Psychol. Sci.''

This was first noticed in 1883, when [[Francis Galton]] overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images.&lt;ref name="Galton, 1878"&gt;Galton, F. (1878).

A feature of beautiful women that has been explored by researchers is a [[waist–hip ratio]] of approximately 0.70. Physiologists have shown that women with [[Female body shape|hourglass figures]] are more fertile than other women due to higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3682657.stm|title=Hourglass figure fertility link|last=|first=|date=4 May 2004|work=BBC News|access-date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4953-barbie-shaped-women-more-fertile/|title=Barbie-shaped women more fertile|last=Bhattacharya|first=Shaoni|date=5 May 2004|website=New Scientist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other commentators have suggested that this preference may not be universal.

Beauty standards are rooted in cultural norms crafted by societies and media over centuries. Globally, it is argued that the predominance of white women featured in movies and advertising leads to a [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] concept of beauty, breeding cultures that assign inferiority to women of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harper|first=Kathryn|last2=Choma|first2=Becky L.|date=2018-10-05|title=Internalised White Ideal, Skin Tone Surveillance, and Hair Surveillance Predict Skin and Hair Dissatisfaction and Skin Bleaching among African American and Indian Women|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-018-0966-9|journal=Sex Roles|doi=10.1007/s11199-018-0966-9|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, societies and cultures across the globe struggle to diminish the longstanding [[internalized racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weedon|first=Chris|date=December 6, 2007|title=Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective|url=|journal=Gender Forum Electronic Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[black is beautiful]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;cultural movement sought to dispel this notion in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DoCarmo|first=|date=December 20, 2007|title=Dr. DoCarmo's Notes on the Black Cultural Movement|url=|journal=|publisher=Bucks County Community College|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of beauty in men is known as '[[bishōnen]]' in Japan. Bishōnen refers to males with distinctly [[Femininity|feminine]] features, physical characteristics establishing the standard of beauty in Japan and typically exhibited in their [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Japanese idol|idols]]. A multibillion-dollar industry of [[Japanese Aesthetic Salons]] exists for this reason. However, different nations have varying male beauty ideals; Eurocentric standards for men include tallness, leanness, and muscularity; thus, these features are idolized through American media, such as in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films and magazine covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.doctornerdlove.com/new-impossible-standards-male-beauty/|title=The New (And Impossible) Standards of Male Beauty|last=|first=|date=2015-01-26|work=Paging Dr. NerdLove|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eurocentrism and beauty ===
The prevailing eurocentric concept of beauty has varying effects on different cultures. Primarily, adherence to this standard among African American women has bred a lack of positive reification of African beauty, and philosopher [[Cornel West]] elaborates that, "much of black self-hatred and self-contempt has to do with the refusal of many black Americans to love their own black bodies-especially their black noses, hips, lips, and hair."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race Matters|last=West|first=Cornel|publisher=Vintage|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These insecurities can be traced back to global idealization of women with light skin, green or blue eyes, and long straight or wavy hair in magazines and media that starkly contrast with the natural features of African women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/socabs/docview/233235409/334D89ECD5AB4AF8PQ/1?accountid=11243|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, internalized [[colorism]] is rooted in Indian culture, in which prevailing value placed on fairer skin tones fuels the [[skin whitening]] industry; products like [[Fair &amp; Lovely (cosmetics)|Fair &amp; Lovely]] thrive in India, with endorsement from [[Bollywood]] celebrities, as well as a general idealization of fair women throughout the film, media, and advertising industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shevde|first=Natasha|date=|title=All's Fair in Love and Cream: A Cultural Case Study of Fair &amp; Lovely in India|url=http://www.michelepolak.com/200fall11/Weekly_Schedule_files/Sheyde.pdf|journal=Advertising &amp; Society Review|volume=9|pages=1-9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, such Eurocentric beauty standards are maintained through Indian culture, and encourage women to artificially change their appearances to adhere to beauty norms and ideals. Further, a societal divide exists between the northern and southern regions of India, as fairer complexioned North Indians are culturally associated with beauty, intelligence, and wealth, based merely on adherence to Eurocentric beauty ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/document-view?p=AWNB&amp;t=continent:Asia!Asia/country:India!India&amp;sort=YMD_date:D&amp;maxresults=20&amp;f=advanced&amp;val-base-0=colorism&amp;fld-base-0=alltext&amp;docref=news/165B3F3483519048|title=50 Shades of Colorism in India|last=Youth|first=Awaaz|date=|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In East Asian cultures, familial pressures and cultural norms shape beauty ideals; professor and scholar Stephanie Wong's experimental study concluded that expecting that men in Asian culture didn't like women who look “fragile” impacted the lifestyle, eating, and appearance choices made by Asian American women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Stephanie N.|last2=Keum|first2=Brian TaeHyuk|last3=Caffarel|first3=Daniel|last4=Srinivasan|first4=Ranjana|last5=Morshedian|first5=Negar|last6=Capodilupo|first6=Christina M.|last7=Brewster|first7=Melanie E.|date=December 2017|title=Exploring the conceptualization of body image for Asian American women.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/aap0000077|journal=Asian American Journal of Psychology|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=296–307|doi=10.1037/aap0000077|issn=1948-1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesocietypages.org/papers/homoegenization-of-asian-beauty/|title=The Homogenization of Asian Beauty - The Society Pages|last=Le|first=C.N|date=June 4, 2014|website=thesocietypages.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the male gaze, media portrayals of Asian women as petite and the portrayal of beautiful women in American media as fair complexioned and slim-figured induce anxiety and depressive symptoms among Asian American women who don't fit either of these beauty ideals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further, the high status associated with fairer skin can be attributed to Asian societal history; upper-class people hired workers to perform outdoor, manual labor, cultivating a visual divide overtime between lighter complexioned, wealthier families and sun tanned, darker laborers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This along with the Eurocentric beauty ideals embedded in Asian culture has made skin lightening creams, [[rhinoplasty]], and [[blepharoplasty]] (an eyelid surgery meant to give Asians a more European, "double-eyelid" appearance) commonplace among Asian women, illuminating the insecurity that results from cultural beauty standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Beauty presents a standard of [[social comparison theory|comparison]], and it can cause resentment and dissatisfaction when not achieved. People who do not fit the "beauty ideal" may be ostracized within their communities. The television sitcom ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' portrays the life of a girl faced with hardships due to society's unwelcoming attitudes toward those they deem unattractive. However, a person may also be targeted for harassment because of their beauty. In ''[[Malèna]]'', a strikingly beautiful Italian woman is forced into poverty by the women of the community who refuse to give her work for fear that she may "woo" their husbands. The documentary ''[[Beauty in the Eyes of the Beheld]]'' explores both the societal blessings and curses of female beauty through interviews of women considered beautiful.

Researchers have found that good looking students get higher grades from their teachers than students with an ordinary appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sharon Begley|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/206597 |title=The Link Between Beauty and Grades |work=Newsweek |date=14 July 2009 |accessdate=2010-05-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420004627/http://www.newsweek.com/id/206597| archivedate=April 20, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies using mock criminal trials have shown that physically attractive "defendants" are less likely to be convicted—and if convicted are likely to receive lighter sentences—than less attractive ones (although the opposite effect was observed when the alleged crime was swindling, perhaps because jurors perceived the defendant's attractiveness as facilitating the crime).&lt;ref&gt;Amina A Memon, Aldert Vrij, Ray Bull (2003).

John Wiley &amp; Sons. pp. 46–47. {{ISBN|047086835X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies among teens and young adults, such as those of psychiatrist and self-help author, [[Eva Ritvo]], show that skin conditions have a profound effect on social behavior and opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/galderma/38432 |title=Image survey reveals "perception is reality" when it comes to teenagers |publisher=multivu.prnewswire.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710073856/http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/galderma/38432 |archivedate=July 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

How much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty. One study found that people low in physical attractiveness earn 5 to 10 percent less than ordinary looking people, who in turn earn 3 to 8 percent less than those who are considered good looking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lorenz |first=K. |year=2005 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/Careers/07/08/looks/ |title=Do pretty people earn more? |work=[[CNN News]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |agency=[[Cable News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the market for loans, the least attractive people are less likely to get approvals, although they are less likely to default.

The '''cello''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|l|oʊ}} {{respell|CHEL|oh}}; plural '''cellos''' or '''celli''') or '''violoncello''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|aɪ|əl|ən|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|l|oʊ}} {{respell|VY|ə-lən|CHEL|oh}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/pronunciation/english/violoncello |title=violoncello noun – Pronunciation |website=Oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-it|vjolonˈtʃɛllo}}) is a [[string instrument]]. It is played by [[Bow (music)|bowing]] or [[pizzicato|plucking]] its four strings, which are usually [[intonation (music)|tuned]] in [[perfect fifth]]s an octave lower than the [[viola]]: from low to high, [[scientific pitch notation|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. It is the bass member of the [[violin family]], which also includes the [[violin]], viola and the [[double bass]], which doubles the bass line an octave lower than the cello in much of the orchestral repertoire. After the double bass, it is the second-largest and second lowest (in pitch) [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]] in the modern symphony orchestra. The cello is used as a solo instrument, as well as in [[chamber music]] ensembles (e.g., [[string quartet]]), [[string orchestra]]s, as a member of the [[string section]] of [[symphony orchestra]]s, most modern [[Chinese orchestra]]s, and some types of [[cello rock|rock bands]]. 

Music for the cello is generally written in the [[bass clef]], but both [[tenor clef]] and [[treble clef]] are used for higher-range parts, both in orchestral/chamber music parts and in solo cello works. A person who plays the cello is called a ''cellist'' or ''violoncellist''. In a small classical ensemble, such as a string quartet, the cello typically plays the [[bassline|bass part]], the lowest-pitched musical line of the piece. In an [[orchestra]] of the [[Baroque era]] (ca. 1600–1750) and [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (ca. 1725–1800), the cello typically plays the bass part, generally doubled an octave lower by the double basses. In Baroque-era music, the cello is often used to play the [[basso continuo]] bassline, typically along with a [[keyboard instrument]] (e.g., [[pipe organ]] or [[harpsichord]]) or a fretted, plucked stringed instrument (e.g., [[lute]] or [[theorbo]]). In such a Baroque performance, the cello player might be joined or replaced by other bass instruments, playing [[bassoon]], [[double bass]], [[viol]] or other low-register instruments.

==Etymology==
The name ''cello'' is derived from the ending of the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''violoncello'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/violoncello|title=Violoncello |publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means "little [[violone]]". The [[violone]] ("big viol") was the lowest-pitched instrument of the [[viol]] family, the group of stringed instruments that went out of fashion around the end of the 17th century in most countries except France, where they survived another half-century before the louder [[violin]] family came into greater favour in that country as well. In modern symphony orchestras, it is the second largest stringed instrument (the [[double bass]] is the largest). Thus, the name "violoncello" contained both the [[augmentative]] "''-one''" ("big") and the [[diminutive]] "''-cello''" ("little"). By the turn of the 20th century, it had become common to shorten the name to 'cello, with the apostrophe indicating the missing stem.&lt;ref name="countess"&gt;{{cite web|author=Delbanco, Nicholas|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108101905/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-70397117.html|title=The Countess of Stanlein Restored|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-70397117.html|publisher=Harper's Magazine|accessdate=4 October 2016|archivedate=January 8, 2009|date=January 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now customary to use "cello" without apostrophe as the full designation.&lt;ref name="countess"/&gt; ''Viol'' is derived from the root ''viola'', which was derived from [[Medieval Latin]] ''vitula'', meaning stringed instrument.

==Description==
[[File:Cello study.jpg|thumb|Cello close-up]]
[[File:Violoncello open strings.png|thumb|Cello open strings. {{audio|Violoncello open strings actual.mid|Play}}]]
Cellos are tuned in [[perfect fifth|fifths]], starting with [[Scientific pitch notation|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (two [[octave]]s below [[middle C]]), followed by G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and then A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is tuned in the same intervals as the [[viola]], but an octave lower. Unlike the [[violin]] or [[viola]] but similar to the [[double bass]], the cello has an [[endpin]] that rests on the floor to support the instrument's weight. The cello is most closely associated with [[Classical music|European classical music]], and has been described as the closest sounding instrument to the human voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leyla Mamedova |author2=Isin Metin |author3=Nuran Ekici |author4=Murad Huseyinov |author5=Gulara Huseyinova |author6=Mehmet Kanter |title=An Ultrastructural Study on the Effects of Different Musical Timbres on the Skeletal Muscle Cells |journal=Asian Journal of Cell Biology |date=2007 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=43–49 |url=http://www.academicjournals.net/2/detail.php?id=2&amp;jid=ajcb&amp;theme=2&amp;issueno=4&amp;articleno=17 |accessdate=4 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207073731/http://www.academicjournals.net/2/detail.php?id=2&amp;jid=ajcb&amp;theme=2&amp;issueno=4&amp;articleno=17 |archivedate=7 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is a part of the standard [[orchestra]], as part of the [[string section]], and is the bass voice of the [[string quartet]] (although many composers give it a melodic role as well), as well as being part of many other [[chamber music|chamber]] groups.

Among the most well-known Baroque works for the cello are [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s six unaccompanied [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Suites]].  The cello possibly figures as a member of the  [[Figured bass|basso continuo]] group in chamber works by [[Francesca Caccini]] (1587–1641), [[Barbara Strozzi]] (1619–1677) with pieces such as ''Il primo libro di madrigali, per 2–5 voci e basso continuo, op. 1'' and  [[Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre|Elisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre]] (1665–1729) who wrote six sonatas for violin and basso continuo.

From the [[Classical music era|Classical era]], the two concertos by [[Joseph Haydn]] in [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Haydn)|C major]] and [[Cello Concerto No. 2 (Haydn)|D major]] stand out, as do the five sonatas for cello and pianoforte of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], which span the important three periods of his compositional evolution. A ''Divertimento for Piano, Clarinet, Viola and Cello'' is among the  surviving works by [[Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] (1739–1807).

A review of compositions for cello in the [[Romantic music era|Romantic era]] must include the German composer [[Fanny Mendelssohn]] (1805–1847) who wrote the Fantasy in G minor for cello and piano and a Capriccio in A-flat for cello.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--Who claims these are important or even well-known works?--&gt; Other well-known works of the era include the [[Robert Schumann]] [[Cello Concerto (Schumann)|Concerto]], the [[Antonín Dvořák]] [[Cello Concerto (Dvořák)|Concerto]] as well as the two sonatas and the [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] by [[Johannes Brahms]].

Compositions from the late-19th and early 20th century include three cello sonatas (including the Cello Sonata in C Minor written in 1880) by [[Ethel Smyth|Dame Ethel Smyth]] (1858–1944),  [[Edward Elgar]]'s [[Cello Concerto (Elgar)|Cello Concerto in E minor]], [[Claude Debussy]]'s [[Cello Sonata (Debussy)|Sonata for Cello and Piano]], and unaccompanied cello sonatas by [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Paul Hindemith]].  Pieces including cello were written by [[American Music Center|American Music Cente]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; founder [[Marion Bauer]] (1882–1955)  (two trio sonatas for flute, cello and piano) and Ruth Crawford Seeger (1901–1953) (Diaphonic suite No. 2 for bassoon and cello).

Polish composer [[Grażyna Bacewicz]] (1909–1969) was writing for cello in the mid 20th century with Concerto No. 1 for Cello and Orchestra (1951), Concerto No. 2 for Cello and Orchestra (1963) and in 1964 composed her Quartet for four cellos. The cello's versatility made it popular with many male composers in this era as well, such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Witold Lutoslawski]] and [[Henri Dutilleux]].

Well-known cellists include [[Jacqueline du Pré|Jacqueline du Pre]], [[Raya Garbousova]], [[Zara Nelsova]], [[Hildur Guðnadóttir|Hildur Gudnadottir]], [[Han-na Chang|Han-Na Chang]], [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] and [[Beatrice Harrison]]. Others include [[Anner Bylsma]], [[Yo-Yo Ma]], [[Pablo Casals]], [[Julian Lloyd Webber]], [[Alfred Wallenstein]], [[Mischa Maisky]] and [[Gregor Piatigorsky]]. See the comprehensive list of [[List of cellists#A 2|cellists]] here.

In the 2010s, the instrument is found in [[popular music]], but was more commonly used in 1970s pop and [[disco]] music.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Today it is sometimes featured in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] recordings, examples of which are noted later in this article. The cello has also recently appeared in major [[hip-hop]] and [[R &amp; B]] performances, such as singers [[Rihanna]] and [[Ne-Yo]]'s performance at the [[American Music Awards]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The instrument has also been modified for [[Indian classical music]] by Nancy Lesh and [[Saskia Rao-de Haas]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Cello#cite note-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

==History&lt;!--'Viola da spalla' redirects here--&gt;==
The [[viola da braccio|violin family]], including cello-sized instruments, emerged c. 1500 as family of instruments distinct from the [[viol|viola da gamba]] family. The earliest depictions of the violin family, from northern Italy c. 1530, show three sizes of instruments, roughly corresponding to what we now call [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, and cellos. Contrary to a popular misconception, the cello did not evolve from the viola da gamba, but existed alongside it for about two and a half centuries. The violin family is also known as the viola da braccio (meaning viola of the arm) family, a reference to the primary way the members of the family are held. This is to distinguish it from the viola da gamba (meaning viola of the leg) family, in which all the members are all held with the legs. The likely predecessors of the violin family include the [[lira da braccio]] and the [[rebec]]. The earliest surviving cellos are made by [[Andrea Amati]], the first known member of the celebrated [[Amati]] family of [[luthier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;.[http://collections.nmmusd.org/Cellos/Amati/Amaticello.html]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--The instrument described is clearly stated to have been a three-string bass, later cut down and remade into a cello.--&gt;

The direct ancestor to the violoncello was the [[bass violin]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Monteverdi referred to the instrument as "basso de viola da braccio" in ''Orfeo'' (1607). Although the first [[bass violin]], possibly invented as early as 1538, was most likely inspired by the viol, it was created to be used in consort with the violin. The bass violin was actually often referred to as a "''violone''", or "large viola", as were the viols of the same period. Instruments that share features with both the bass violin and the ''viola da gamba'' appear in Italian art of the early 16th century.

The invention of wire-wound [[String (music)|strings]] (fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in [[Bologna]], allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play [[virtuoso|virtuosic]] passages.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by [[organ (music)|organ]], [[theorbo]] or [[violone]].

Around 1700, Italian players popularized the cello in northern Europe, although the bass violin (basse de violon) continued to be used for another two decades in France.{{citation needed|date=November 2007}}&lt;!--I believe you, I would just like to know where you got the info--&gt; Many existing bass violins were literally cut down in size to convert them into cellos according to the smaller pattern developed by [[Stradivarius]], who also made a number of old pattern large cellos (the 'Servais').&lt;ref name="vrzuok" &gt;{{Cite journal|last= Cyr |first= Mary |title= Basses and basse continue in the Orchestra of the Paris Opéra 1700–1764 |journal= Early Music |volume= X |issue= Apr., 1982 |pages= 155–170 |doi=10.1093/earlyj/10.2.155|ref=harv }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The sizes, names, and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time.&lt;ref name="vrzuok"/&gt; The size was not standardized until around 1750.

Despite similarities to the [[viol|viola da gamba]], the cello is actually part of the [[viola da braccio]] family, meaning "viol of the arm", which includes, among others, the [[violin]] and [[viola]]. Though paintings like [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Bruegel]]'s "The Rustic Wedding", and [[Philibert Jambe de Fer|Jambe de Fer]] in his ''Epitome Musical'' suggest that the bass violin had alternate playing positions, these were short-lived and the more practical and ergonomic ''a gamba'' position eventually replaced them entirely.

[[File:Cello strung gut.JPG|thumb|right|A baroque cello strung with gut strings. Note the absence of fine-tuning pins on the tailpiece.]]
[[Baroque]]-era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing.{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--What?!--&gt; Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theclassymusician.com/blog/the-endpin |title=The Endpin – The Classy Musician |website=Theclassymusician.com |date=March 7, 2016  |author=Marsh, Gregory and Elizabeth |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the [[Bow frog|frog]]; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of [[Catgut|gut]], with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello,{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.

Few educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century, and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique. One of the earliest cello manuals is [[Michel Corrette]]'s ''Méthode, thèorique et pratique pour apprendre en peu de temps le violoncelle dans sa perfection'' (Paris, 1741).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cello.org/heaven/wasiel/18italy.htm |title=Cello Playing in 18th Century Italy |website=Cello.org |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==

===Orchestral===
[[File:FHM-Orchestra-mk2006-03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cello section of the orchestra of the Munich University of Applied Sciences is shown here.]]
Cellos are part of the standard [[orchestra|symphony orchestra]], which usually includes eight to twelve cello players. The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on stage left (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The ''principal'' cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, playing solos and leading entrances (when the section begins to play its part). Principal players always sit closest to the audience.

The cellos are a critical part of orchestral music; all symphonic works involve the cello section, and many pieces require cello soli or solos. Much of the time, cellos provide part of the low-register harmony for the orchestra. Often, the cello section plays the melody for a brief period, before returning to the harmony role. There are also cello [[concerto]]s, which are orchestral pieces that feature a solo cellist accompanied by an entire orchestra.

===Solo===
There are numerous [[cello concerto]]s – where a solo cello is accompanied by an [[orchestra]] – notably 25 by [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]], 12 by [[Luigi Boccherini|Boccherini]], at least 3 by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], 3 by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;E. Bach]], 2 by [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]], 2 by Dvořák, and one each by Robert Schumann], [[Édouard Lalo|Lalo]], and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]. There were also some cellists who, while not otherwise composers, did write cello-specific repertoire, such as [[Nikolaus Kraft]] who wrote six cello concertos. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] for Cello, Violin and Piano and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]' [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Double Concerto]] for Cello and Violin are also part of the concertante repertoire although in both cases the cello shares solo duties with at least one other instrument. Moreover, several composers wrote large-scale pieces for cello and orchestra, which are concertos in all but name. Some familiar "concertos" are [[Richard Strauss]]' [[tone poem]] ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]'', [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'', [[Ernest Bloch|Bloch]]'s ''[[Schelomo]]'' and [[Max Bruch|Bruch]]'s ''[[Kol Nidrei (Bruch)|Kol Nidrei]]''.

In the 20th century, the cello repertoire grew immensely. This was partly due to the influence of virtuoso cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who inspired, commissioned and premiered dozens of new works. Among these, Prokofiev's ''[[Symphony-Concerto (Prokofiev)|Symphony-Concerto]]'', [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]'s ''[[Cello Symphony]]'', the concertos of Shostakovich and Lutosławski as well as Dutilleux's ''[[Tout un monde lointain...]]'' have already become part of the standard repertoire. Other major composers who wrote concertante works for him include [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]], [[André Jolivet|Jolivet]], [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]]. In addition, [[Malcolm Arnold|Arnold]], [[Samuel Barber|Barber]], [[Philip Glass|Glass]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Arthur Honegger|Honegger]], Ligeti, [[Nikolai Myaskovsky|Myaskovsky]], Penderecki, [[Joaquín Rodrigo|Rodrigo]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos|Villa-Lobos]] and [[William Walton|Walton]] also wrote major [[List of compositions for cello and orchestra|concertos]] for other cellists, notably for [[Gaspar Cassadó]], [[Aldo Parisot]], Gregor Piatigorsky, [[Siegfried Palm]] and [[Julian Lloyd Webber]].

There are also many [[cello sonata|sonatas]] for cello and [[piano]]. Those written by [[Beethoven]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Brahms]], [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], Shostakovich, Prokofiev, [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Elliott Carter|Carter]], and [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]] are particularly well known.

Other important pieces for cello and piano include Schumann's five ''Stücke im Volkston'' and transcriptions like [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[Arpeggione Sonata]] (originally for [[arpeggione]] and piano), [[César Franck]]'s [[Cello Sonata (Franck/Delsart)|Cello Sonata]] (originally a violin sonata, transcribed by [[Jules Delsart]] with the composer's approval), [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)#Suite italienne|Suite italienne]]'' (transcribed by the composer – with Gregor Piatigorsky – from his ballet ''Pulcinella'') and [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]'s first rhapsody (also transcribed by the composer, originally for violin and piano).

There are pieces for [[List of solo cello pieces|cello solo]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.&amp;nbsp;S. Bach]]'s six [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Suites for Cello]] (which are among the best-known solo cello pieces), [[Zoltán Kodály|Kodály]]'s [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Kodály)|Sonata for Solo Cello]] and Britten's three [[Cello Suites (Britten)|Cello Suites]]. Other notable examples include [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]]'s and [[Eugène Ysaÿe|Ysaÿe]]'s Sonatas for Solo Cello, Dutilleux's ''Trois Strophes sur le Nom de Sacher'', Berio's ''Les Mots Sont Allés'', [[Gaspar Cassadó|Cassadó]]'s Suite for Solo Cello, Ligeti's [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Ligeti)|Solo Sonata]], Carter's two ''Figment''s and [[Iannis Xenakis|Xenakis]]' ''[[Nomos Alpha]]'' and ''Kottos''.

===Quartets and other ensembles===
The cello is a member of the traditional [[string quartet]] as well as [[string quintets]], [[string sextet|sextet]] or [[string trio|trios]] and other mixed ensembles.
There are also pieces written for two, three, four or more cellos; this type of ensemble is also called a "cello choir" and its sound is familiar from the introduction to [[Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture]] as well as Zaccharia's prayer scene in [[Verdi]]'s [[Nabucco]]. [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[1812 Overture]] also starts with a cello ensemble, with four cellos playing the top lines and two violas playing the bass lines.  As a self-sufficient ensemble, its most famous repertoire is [[Villa-Lobos]]' first of his [[Bachianas Brasileiras]] for cello ensemble (the fifth is for soprano and 8 cellos). Other examples are [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s cello duets, quartet, and sextet, [[Pärt]]'s [[Fratres]] for 8 cellos and [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]]' ''Messagesquisse'' for 7 cellos, or even Villa-Lobos' rarely played ''Fantasia Concertante'' (1958) for 32 cellos. The 12 cellists of the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] (or "the Twelve" as they have since taken to being called) specialize in this repertoire and have commissioned many works, including arrangements of well-known popular songs.

===Popular music, jazz, world music and neoclassical===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
[[File:Apocalyptica - Ilosaarirock 2009.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Apocalyptica]] at the 2009 [[Ilosaarirock]] festival.]]
The cello is less common in [[popular music]] than in classical music. Several bands feature a cello in their standard line-up, e.g. Joe Kwon of [[The Avett Brothers]]. The more common use in [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rock music|rock]] is to bring the instrument in for a particular song. In the 1960s, artists such as [[the Beatles]] and [[Cher]] used the cello in popular music, in songs such as The Beatles' "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]", "[[Eleanor Rigby]]" and "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]", and Cher's "[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]". "[[Good Vibrations]]" by [[the Beach Boys]] includes the cello in its instrumental ensemble, which includes a number of instruments unusual for this sort of music. Bass guitarist [[Jack Bruce]], who had  originally studied music on a performance scholarship for cello, played a prominent cello part in "As You Said" on [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s ''[[Wheels of Fire]]'' studio album (1968).

In the 1970s, the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] enjoyed great commercial success taking inspiration from so-called "Beatlesque" arrangements, adding the cello (and violin) to the standard rock combo line-up and in 1978 the UK based rock band, [[Colosseum II]], collaborated with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber on the recording ''[[Variations (Andrew Lloyd Webber album)|Variations]]''. Most notably, [[Pink Floyd]] included a cello solo in their 1970 epic instrumental "[[Atom Heart Mother (suite)|Atom Heart Mother]]". Bass guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] was originally a cellist and included some cello parts in their ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' album.

Established non-traditional cello groups include [[Apocalyptica]], a group of Finnish cellists best known for their versions of [[Metallica]] songs, [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]], a group of cellists committed to an intricate cello style intermingled with Gothic music, the [[Massive Violins]], an ensemble of seven singing cellists known for their arrangements of rock, pop and classical hits, Von Cello, a cello fronted rock power trio, [[Break of Reality]] who mix elements of classical music with the more modern rock and metal genre, [[Cello Fury]], a cello rock band that performs original rock/classical crossover music, and Jelloslave, a Minneapolis-based Cello duo with two percussionists. These groups are examples of a style that has become known as [[cello rock]]. The crossover string quartet [[Bond (band)|bond]] also includes a cellist. Silenzium and Cellissimo Quartet are [[Russia]]n (Novosibirsk) groups playing rock and metal and having more and more popularity in [[Siberia]]. [[Cold Fairyland]] from [[Shanghai]], [[China]] is using a cello along a [[Pipa]] as the main solo instrument to create East meets West progressive (folk) rock.

More recent bands using the cello are [[Aerosmith]], [[The Auteurs]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[James (band)|James]], [[Talk Talk]], [[Phillip Phillips]], [[OneRepublic]], and the [[baroque rock]] band [[Arcade Fire]]. An Atlanta-based trio, King Richard's Sunday Best, also uses a cellist in their lineup. So-called "chamber pop" artists like [[Kronos Quartet]], The Vitamin String Quartet and Margot and the Nuclear So and So's have also recently made cello common in modern alternative rock. Heavy metal band [[System of a Down]] has also made use of the cello's rich sound. The indie rock band [[The Stiletto Formal]] are known for using a cello as a major staple of their sound, similarly, the indie rock band [[Canada (music group)|Canada]] employs two cello players in their lineup. The orch-rock group, [[The Polyphonic Spree]], which has pioneered the use of stringed and symphonic instruments, employs the cello in very creative ways for many of their "[[psychedelia|psychedelic]]-esque" melodies. The first wave [[screamo]] band ''I Would Set Myself On Fire For You'' featured a cello as well as a viola to create a more [[Folk music|folk]]-oriented sound. The band, [[Panic! at the Disco]] uses a cello in their song, "Build God, Then We'll Talk". The lead vocalist of the band, [[Brendon Urie]], also did the recording of the cello solo. [[The Lumineers]] added cellist Nela Pekarek to the band in 2010. She plays cello, sings harmony and duets.

In [[jazz]], bassists [[Oscar Pettiford]] and [[Harry Babasin]] were among the first to use the cello as a solo instrument; both tuned their instrument in fourths, an octave above the double bass. [[Fred Katz (cellist)|Fred Katz]] (who was not a bassist) was one of the first notable jazz cellists to use the instrument's standard tuning and arco technique. Contemporary jazz cellists include [[Abdul Wadud (musician)|Abdul Wadud]], [[Diedre Murray]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Dave Holland]], [[David Darling (musician)|David Darling]], [[Lucio Amanti]], Akua Dixon, [[Ernst Reijseger]], [[Fred Lonberg-Holm]], [[Tom Cora]] and [[Erik Friedlander]]. Modern musical theatre pieces like Jason Robert Brown's [[The Last Five Years]], Duncan Sheik's [[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]], Adam Guettel's [[Floyd Collins (musical)|Floyd Collins]], and Ricky Ian Gordon's [[My Life with Albertine]] use small string ensembles (including solo cellos) to a prominent extent.

In Indian Classical music [[Saskia Rao-de Haas]] is a well established soloist as well as playing duets with her sitarist husband Pt. [[Shubhendra Rao]]. Other cellists performing Indian classical music are: Nancy Lesh (Dhrupad) and Anup Biswas. Both Rao and Lesh play the cello sitting cross-legged on the floor.

The cello can also be used in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[folk music]], with notable players including [[Ben Sollee]] of the [[Sparrow Quartet]] and the "Cajun cellist" Sean Grissom, as well as [[Vyvienne Long]] who, in addition to her own projects, has played for those of [[Damien Rice]]. Cellists such as [[Natalie Haas]], Abby Newton and Liz Davis Maxfield have contributed significantly to the use of cello playing in Celtic folk music, often with the cello featured as a primary melodic instrument and employing the skills and techniques of traditional fiddle playing. [[Lindsay Mac]] is becoming well known for playing the cello like a guitar, with her cover of [[The Beatles]]' "[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]".

==Construction==
[[File:Cello Parts.jpg|thumb|Main parts of the cello|230px]]
The cello is typically made from carved wood, although other materials such as [[carbon fiber]] or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a [[spruce]] top, with [[maple]] for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as [[Populus|poplar]] or [[willow]], are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of [[Plywood|laminated wood]]. Laminated cellos are widely used in elementary and secondary school orchestras and [[youth orchestra]]s, because they are much more durable than carved wood cellos (i.e., they are less likely to crack if bumped or dropped) and they are much less expensive.

The top and back are traditionally hand-carved, though less expensive cellos are often machine-produced. The sides, or ribs, are made by heating the wood and bending it around forms. The cello body has a wide top bout, narrow middle formed by two C-bouts, and wide bottom bout, with the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and [[F holes]] just below the middle. The top and back of the cello has decorative border inlay known as [[purfling]]. While purfling is attractive, it is also functional: if the instrument is struck, the purfling can prevent cracking of the wood. A crack may form at the rim of the instrument, but spreads no further. Without purfling, cracks can spread up or down the top or back. Playing, traveling and the weather all affect the cello and can increase a crack if purfling is not in place. Less expensive instruments typically have painted purfling.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Alternative materials===
Cello manufacturer [[Luis and Clark|Luis &amp; Clark]] constructs cellos from [[carbon fibre]]. Carbon fibre instruments are particularly suitable for outdoor playing because of the strength of the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Luis &amp; Clark has produced over 1000 cellos, some of which are owned by cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/arts/music/19carb.html?_r=0 |title=Cold Case: Luis and Clark Carbon Expedition for Yo-Yo Ma? |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 18, 2009 |author=Chris Museler |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Josephine van Lier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Lier|first1=Josephine|title=Luis and Clark Carbon Fibre Cells|url=http://www.albertastringassociation.ca/docs/ASANewsletterSummer2006.pdf|website=Alberta String Association|accessdate=4 October 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407090955/http://www.albertastringassociation.ca/docs/ASANewsletterSummer2006.pdf|archivedate=April 7, 2014|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an unknown number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum double basses and violins).

===Neck, fingerboard, pegbox, and scroll===
Above the main body is the carved neck. The neck has a curved cross-section on its underside, which is where the player's thumb runs along the neck during playing. The neck which leads to a [[pegbox]] and the [[scroll (music)|scroll]]. The neck, pegbox, and scroll are normally carved out of a single piece of wood, usually [[maple]]. The [[fingerboard]] is glued to the neck and extends over the body of the instrument. The fingerboard is given a curved shape, matching the curve on the bridge. Both the fingerboard and bridge need to be curved so that the performer can bow individual strings. If the cello were to have a flat fingerboard and bridge, as with a typical guitar, the performer would only be able to bow the "outer" two strings or bow all the strings. The performer would not be able to play the "inner" two strings alone.

The [[Nut (instrumental)|nut]] is a raised piece of wood, fitted where the fingerboard meets the pegbox, in which the strings rest in shallow slots or grooves to keep them the correct distance apart. The pegbox houses four tapered [[tuning peg]]s, one for each string. The pegs are used to tune the cello by either tightening or loosening the string. The pegs are called "friction pegs", because they maintain their position by friction. The scroll is a traditional ornamental part of the cello and a feature of all other members of the [[violin family]]. [[Ebony]] is usually used for the tuning pegs, fingerboard, and nut, but other hardwoods, such as [[Buxus|boxwood]] or [[rosewood]], can be used. Black fittings on low-cost instruments are often made from inexpensive wood that has been blackened or "ebonized" to look like [[ebony]], which is much harder and more expensive. Ebonised parts such as tuning pegs may crack or split, and the black surface of the fingerboard will eventually wear down to reveal the lighter wood underneath.

===Strings===
Historically, cello [[String (music)|strings]] had cores made out of [[catgut]], which, despite its name is made from sheep or goat intestines which are dried out. Most modern strings used in the 2010s are wound with metallic materials like [[aluminum]], [[titanium]] and [[chromium]]. Cellists may mix different types of strings on their instruments. The pitches of the open strings are C, G, D, and A (black note heads in the playing range figure above), unless alternative tuning ([[scordatura]]) is specified by the composer. Some composers (e.g. [[Ottorino Respighi]] in the final movement of ‘’[[The Pines of Rome]]’’) ask that the low C be tuned down to a B{{Music|b}} or B so that the performer can play a different low note on the lowest open string.

===Tailpiece and endpin===
The [[tailpiece]] and [[endpin]] are found in the lower part of the cello. The tailpiece is the part of the cello to which the "ball ends" of the strings are attached by passing them through holes. The tailpiece is attached to the bottom of the cello. The tailpiece is traditionally made of [[ebony]] or another hard wood, but can also be made of [[plastic]] or [[steel]] on lower-cost instruments. It attaches the strings to the lower end of the cello, and can have one or more fine tuners. The fine tuners are used to make smaller adjustments to the pitch of the string. The fine tuners can increase the tension of each string (raising the pitch) or decrease the tension of the string (lowering the pitch). When the performer is putting on a new string, the fine tuner for that string is normally reset to a middle position, and then the peg is turned to bring the string up to pitch. The fine turners are used for subtle, minor adjustments to pitch, such as tuning a cello to the oboe's 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note or to tune the cello to a piano.

The endpin or spike is made of wood, metal or rigid carbon fibre and supports the cello in playing position. The endpin can be retracted into the hollow body of the instrument when the cello is being transported in its case. This makes the cello easier to move about. When the performer wishes to play the cello, the endpin is pulled out to lengthen it. The endpin is locked into the player's preferred length with a screw mechanism. The adjustable nature of endpins enables performers of different ages and body sizes to adjust the endpin length to suit them.  In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves, as there was no endpin at that time. The endpin was "introduced by Adrien Servais {{circa}} 1845 to give the instrument greater stability".&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stowell|first=Robin|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Cello|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvlhQgAACAAJ|date=June 28, 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word "endpin" sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called "tailpin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/stringed-instrument |title=Stringed instrument |website=britannica.com |author=Eric Halfpenny |author2=Theodore C Grame |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor. Many cellists use a rubber pad with a metal cup to keep the tip from slipping on the floor. A number of accessories to keep the endpin from slipping; these include ropes which attach to the chair leg and other devices.

===Bridge and f-holes===
[[File:Cello bridge2.JPG|right|thumb|The bridge of a cello, with a mute (the mute is not in use)]]
The [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] holds the strings above the cello and transfers their vibrations to the top of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The bridge is usually positioned by the cross point of the "f-hole" (i.e., where the horizontal line occurs in the "f"). The [[sound-hole|f-holes]], named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process.  They probably actually stand for an old style medial S, for words related to Sound.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small length of rubber hose containing a water-soaked sponge, called a Dampit, is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier. This keeps the wood components of the cello from drying out.

===Internal features===
Internally, the cello has two important features: a [[bass bar]], which is glued to the underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden [[sound post]], a solid wooden cylinder which is wedged between the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations from the strings to the body of the instrument. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of the instrument (and to a lesser extent the back), acting as a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] to produce the instrument's sound.

===Glue===
Cellos are constructed and repaired using [[hide glue]], which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs call for the removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it lets go, so the plate does not crack. Cellists repairing cracks in their cello do not use regular [[wood glue]], because it cannot be steamed open when a repair has to be made by a [[luthier]].

===Bow===
[[File:Bow hand Violoncello.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|A cello French bow&lt;ref&gt;As opposed to the German bow popular in baroque era, held underhand.&lt;/ref&gt; ''sul ponticello'']]
Traditionally, [[bow (music)|bows]] are made from [[Paubrasilia|pernambuco]] or [[brazilwood]]. Both come from the same species of tree (''Caesalpinia echinata''), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, &lt;!--and high sound velocity--&gt;which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. Horsehair is stretched out between the two ends of the bow. The taut horsehair is drawn over the strings to produce the cello's characteristic tone. A small knob is twisted to increase or decrease the tension of the horsehair. The tension on the bow is released when the instrument is not being used. The amount of tension a cellist puts on the bow hair depends on the preferences of the player, the style of music being played, and for students, the preferences of their teacher.

Bows are also made from other materials, such as carbon-fibre—stronger than wood—and fiberglass (often used to make inexpensive, lower-quality student bows). An average cello bow is {{convert|73|cm|in|abbr=on}} long (shorter than a violin or viola bow) {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} high (from the frog to the stick) and {{convert|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The frog of a cello bow typically has a rounded corner like that of a viola bow, but is wider. A cello bow is roughly {{convert|10|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier than a viola bow, which in turn is roughly {{convert|10|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier than a violin bow. &lt;!-- for example, see http://www.codabow.com/info_buyfirstbow.html --&gt;

Bow hair is traditionally [[horsehair]], though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back, and increase the tension of the hair. [[Rosin]] is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically. [[Baroque]] style (1600–1750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn gives off a louder sound.

The cello bow has also been used to play [[electric guitar]]s. Jimmy Page pioneered its application on tracks such as "[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]". The [[post-rock]] [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] band [[Sigur Rós]]'s lead singer often plays a guitar using a cello bow.

In 1989, the German cellist [[Michael Bach (musician)|Michael Bach]] began developing a [[curved bow]], encouraged by [[John Cage]], [[Dieter Schnebel]], Mstislav Rostropovich and [[Luigi Colani]]: and since then many pieces have been composed especially for it. This curved bow (''BACH.Bow'') is a convex curved bow which, unlike the ordinary bow, renders possible polyphonic playing on the various strings of the instrument. The solo repertoire for violin and cello by J. S. Bach the BACH.Bow is particularly suited to it: and it was developed with this in mind, polyphonic playing being required, as well as monophonic.

==Physics==

===Physical aspects===
When a string is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves the air around it, producing sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a hollow body, the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes the character of the sound produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowling|first=Elizabeth|title=The cello|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=46gXAQAAIAAJ|year=1983|publisher=C. Scribner's Sons|isbn=978-0-684-17870-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length and the net forces it experiences during a distortion.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield, Louis A 2001. pp 241-244"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloomfield|first=Louis|title=How things work: the physics of everyday life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgUvAQAAIAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-38151-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension of its strings, by turning the tuning pegs mounted on its pegbox, and tension adjusters (fine tuners) on the tail piece.

A string’s length also affects its fundamental pitch. Shortening a string stiffens it by increasing its curvature during a distortion and subjecting it to larger net forces. Shortening the string also reduces its mass,  but does not alter the mass per unit length,  and it is the latter ratio rather than the total mass which governs the frequency.   The string vibrates in a standing wave whose speed of propagation is given by {{sqrt|''T''/''m''}},  where ''T'' is the tension and ''m'' is the mass per unit length;    there is a node at either end of the vibrating length,  and thus the vibrating length ''l'' is half a wavelength.    Since the frequency of any wave is equal to the speed divided by the wavelength,  we have frequency = {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|2''l''}} × {{sqrt|''T''/''m''}}}}.   (Note that some writers,  including Muncaster (cited below) use the Greek letter ''μ'' in place of ''m''.) Thus shortening a string increases the frequency,  and thus the pitch. Because of this effect, you can raise and change the pitch of a string by pressing it against the fingerboard in the cello’s neck and effectively shortening it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muncaster|first=Roger|title=A-level Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Knov8XAyf2cC|year=1993|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-1584-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise strings with less mass per unit length,  if under the same tension,  will have a higher frequency and thus higher pitch than more massive strings.   This is a prime reason why the different strings on all string instruments have different fundamental pitches,  with the lightest strings having the highest pitches.

A played note of E or F{{music|#}} has a frequency which is often very close to the natural resonating frequency of the body of the instrument,  and if the problem is not addressed this can set the body into near resonance.   This may cause an unpleasant sudden amplification of this pitch,  and additionally a loud beating sound results from the interference produced between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the “[[wolf tone]]” because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello front plate, attaching a wolf eliminator (a metal cylinder or a rubber cylinder encased in metal), or moving the sound post.&lt;ref name="Berg, Richard E 2005. pp 314, 329"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=Richard E.|last2=Stork|first2=David G.|title=The Physics of Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FpgQgAACAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-145789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a string is bowed or plucked to produce a note, the fundamental note is accompanied by higher frequency overtones. Each sound has a particular recipe of frequencies that combine to make the total sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chattopadhyay|first=D.|title=Elements Of Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eA7g3aXePRoC|date=January 1, 2004|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-1538-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing technique==
{{main|Cello technique}}
[[File:Cello KSG 9829 PK.jpg|thumb|A cellist]]
Playing the cello is done while seated with the instrument supported on the floor by the endpin. The left hand fingertips stop the strings on the fingerboard, determining the pitch of the fingered note. The right hand plucks or bows the strings to sound the notes. The left hand fingertips stop the strings along their length, determining the pitch of each fingered note. Stopping the string closer to the bridge results in  higher-pitched sound, because the vibrating string length has been shortened. In the ''neck'' positions (which use just less than half of the fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in ''[[thumb position]]'' (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.

[[Vibrato]] is a small oscillation in the pitch of a note, usually considered expressive. [[Harmonics]] played on the cello fall into two classes; natural and artificial. Natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching (but not depressing) the string with the finger at certain places, and then bowing (or, rarely, plucking) the string. For example, the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered (open) string. Natural harmonics only produce notes that are part of the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] on a particular string. Artificial harmonics (also called false harmonics or stopped harmonics), in which the player depresses the string fully with one finger while touching the same string lightly with another finger, can produce any note above middle C. 
[[Glissando]] (Italian for "sliding") is an effect played by sliding the finger up or down the fingerboard without releasing the string. This causes the pitch to rise and fall smoothly, without separate, discernible steps.

In cello playing, the bow is much like the breath of a [[wind instrument]] player. Arguably, it is the major determinant in the expressiveness of the playing. The right hand holds the bow and controls the duration and character of the notes. The bow is drawn across the strings roughly halfway between the end of the [[fingerboard]] and the bridge, in a direction perpendicular to the strings. The bow is held with all five fingers of the right hand, the thumb opposite the fingers and closer to the cellist's body. Tone production and volume of sound depend on a combination of several factors. The three most important ones are: bow speed, weight applied to the string, and point of contact of the bow hair with the string.

[[Double stop]]s involve the playing of two notes at the same time. Two strings are fingered simultaneously, and the bow is drawn so as to sound them both at once. In [[pizzicato]] playing, the string is plucked directly with the fingers or thumb. Pizzicato is often abbreviated as "Pizz.". Position of the hand is slightly over the finger board and away from the bridge.

A player using the [[col legno]] technique strikes or rubs the strings with the wood of the bow rather than the hair. In [[spiccato]] playing, the strings are not "drawn" by the bow hair but struck by it, while still retaining some horizontal motion, to generate a more percussive, crisp sound. In [[staccato]], the player moves the bow a small distance and stops it on the string, making a short sound, the rest of the written duration being taken up by silence. 
[[Legato]] is a technique where the notes are smoothly connected without accents or breaks. It is noted by a slur (curved line) above or below – depending on their position on the staff – the notes of the passage that is to be played legato.

''Sul ponticello'' ("on the bridge") refers to bowing closer to the bridge, while ''sul tasto'' ("on the fingerboard") calls for bowing nearer the end of the fingerboard. Sul tasto produces a more flute-like sound, with more emphasis on the fundamental frequency of the note, and softer overtones.

==Sizes==
[[File:Full size and fractional cello.jpg|thumb|{{frac|1|8}} size cello with full size cello]]
Standard-sized cellos are referred to as "full-size" or "{{frac|4|4}}" but are also made in smaller (fractional) sizes (e.g. {{frac|7|8}}, {{frac|3|4}}, {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|1|8}}, {{frac|1|10}}, {{frac|1|16}}). The fractions refer to volume rather than length, so a 1/2 size cello is much longer than half the length of a full size.  The smaller cellos are identical to standard cellos in construction, range, and usage, but are simply scaled-down for the benefit of children and shorter adults.

Cellos in sizes larger than {{frac|4|4}} do exist, and cellists with unusually large hands may require such a non-standard instrument. Cellos made before approximately 1700 tended to be considerably larger than those made and commonly played today. Around 1680, changes in string-making technology made it possible to play lower-pitched notes on shorter strings. The cellos of [[Stradivari]], for example, can be clearly divided into two models: the style made before 1702, characterized by larger instruments (of which only three exist in their original size and configuration), and the style made during and after 1707, when Stradivari began making smaller cellos. This later model is the design most commonly used by modern luthiers. The [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of a {{frac|4|4}} cello is about {{convert|27+1/2|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The new size offered fuller tonal projection and greater range of expression. The instrument in this form was able to contribute to more pieces musically and offered the possibility of greater physical dexterity for the player to develop technique.&lt;ref name="size"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stowell|first=Robin|title=The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bJAZU27hWEC|date=November 13, 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00042-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessories==
There are many accessories for the cello.
*Cases are used to protect the cello and bow (or multiple bows).
[[File:Rosins.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Rosin is applied to bow hairs to increase the "bite" of the bow on the strings.]]
*[[Rosin]], made from [[Pinophyta|conifer]] [[resin]], is applied to the bow hairs to increase the effectiveness of the friction, grip or bite, and allow proper sound production. Rosin may have additives to modify the friction such as beeswax, gold, silver or tin. Commonly, rosins are classified as either Dark or Light.
*[[Endpin]] stops or straps (tradenames include Rockstop and Black Hole) keep the cello from sliding if the endpin does not have a rubber piece on the end, or if a floor is particularly slippery.
*[[Wolf tone eliminator]]s are placed on cello strings between the tailpiece and the bridge to eliminate acoustic anomalies known as [[wolf tone]]s or "wolfs".
*[[Mute (music)#String|Mutes]] are used to change the sound of the cello by reducing [[overtones]] and to reduce the amount of noise produced by the instrument by preventing the bridge vibrating as much.
[[File:Wolf tone eliminator.jpg|thumb|150px|A brass wolf tone eliminator typically placed on the G string (second string from the left) of a cello, between the bridge and the tailpiece. (The black rubber piece on the D string (third from the left) is a [[mute (music)|mute]].)]]
*[[Metronome]]s provide a steady [[tempo]] by sounding out a certain number of beats per minute.

==Instrument makers==

==Cellists==
{{Main|List of cellists}}
A person who plays the cello is called a ''cellist''. For a list of notable cellists, see the [[list of cellists]] and [[:Category:Cellists]].

==Careers==
Careers in cello vary widely by genre and by region or country. Most cellists earn their living from a mixture of performance and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance jobs is by playing at an [[audition]]. In some styles of music, cellists may be asked to [[sight reading|sight read]] printed music or perform standard repertoire with an ensemble.

In classical music, cellists audition for playing jobs in orchestras and for admission into university or Conservatory programs or degrees. At a classical cello audition, the performer typically plays a movement from a Bach suite or a movement from a concerto and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the [[conductor (music)|conductor]], the [[Concertmaster]], the Principal cellist and other principal players.

The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a ''test week'', in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.

Performance jobs include playing as a freelancer in small groups, playing in a [[chamber music]] group, large ensembles, or performing solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting ("subbing") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players to be able to find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can come to this is in the case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.

Teaching work for cellists includes giving private lessons in the home or at colleges and universities; coaching cellists who are preparing for recordings or auditions; doing group coaching at music camps or for youth ensembles; and working as a high school music teacher. Due to the limited number of full-time orchestral jobs, many classical cellists are not able to find full-time work with a single orchestra. Some cellists increase their employ-ability by learning several different styles, such as folk or pop.

In some cases, cellists supplement their performing and teaching income with other related music jobs, such as working as a stringed instrument repairer (luthier); as a contractor who hires musicians for orchestras or big bands, composing music, songwriting, conducting, or organizing festivals (e.g., [[Julian Armour]]).

==Famous instruments==
{{See also|Category:Individual cellos}}
[[File:Servais Stradivarius.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|The Servais Stradivarius is preserved in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]]]]
Specific instruments are famous (or become famous) for a variety of reasons. An instrument's notability may arise from its age, the fame of its maker, its physical appearance, its acoustic properties, and its use by notable performers. The most famous instruments are generally known for all of these things. The most highly prized instruments are now collector's items, and are priced beyond the reach of most musicians. These instruments are typically owned by some kind of organization or investment group, which may loan the instrument to a notable performer. (For example, the [[Davidov Stradivarius]], which is currently in the possession of one of the most widely known living cellists, Yo-Yo Ma, is actually owned by the Vuitton Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Beare | first=Charles | author2=Carlson, Bruce | chapter=Foreword by Yo-Yo Ma | title=Antonio Stradivari: The Cremona Exhibition of 1987 | location=London | publisher=J. &amp; A.

== Plot ==

Paul and Hélène, a wealthy Parisian couple, are preparing to go out for the evening. While driving, they see three men chasing a prostitute down the street. She begs them to save her by letting her into the car, but Paul locks the doors and drives away as the three men savagely beat her, leaving her unconscious in the street. He refuses to let Hélène phone an ambulance, afraid of being charged with not helping a person in danger (which is a crime in France).

Hélène cannot forget the incident, and the next day she goes to the hospital, where she finds the prostitute, Noémie, in a coma. Moved, Hélène stops work and leaves her family responsibilities to stay with Noémie throughout her recovery, aiding her as she regains mobility and helping her to communicate since she can't yet speak. When one of the pimps returns to threaten and beat Noémie again into submission, Hélène follows him out of the hospital, knocks him unconscious with a wooden plank, and leaves him for the police to find.

Meanwhile, Paul and Hélène's son Fabrice, a university student, is cheating on his girlfriend with another girl, who is pregnant. When his girlfriend discovers the truth, she destroys his apartment. He moves into Paul's apartment just as Hélène moves out, and the two girls follow him, much to Paul's chagrin.

When Hélène returns home for a day, one of Noémie's pimps goes to the hospital with a friend and removes Noémie under the pretense that they are relatives taking her for a walk.  Noémie, who still cannot speak, is unable to protest.  Realising what has happened, she accosts the pimps on the street and takes Noémie to Paul's mother's house.  There, Noémie recovers her ability to talk, and explains her life story:

Her name is actually Malika, and she is a child of poor French-Algerian immigrants. At 17, her father attempted to sell her into an arrange marriage and she fled. She was picked up by a pimp, named Touki, on the street and he subsequently sold her into sexual slavery and had her hooked on heroin. She convinced Touki to move to Paris to speak to her step-mother and retrieve her passport. Her family kicked her out, and she formed plans to leave her life of forced prostitution behind. She sobered up and opened up an account with her sister, Zora's passport to put some money behind. She tried going to [[SOS Racism]] for help, but she was dismissed. She moved to [[Geneva]] and seduced a rich man and conned him into giving her all of his money and jewelry, just before he died. She and Touki returned to Paris with the money. However, the rich man's family went to the press with claims that their money was stolen from the bank. Her pimps found out that she laundered the money for herself and beat her into signing a proxy. She escaped, with Touki and the other two pimps chasing after her, which was when Hélène and her husband came across her in their car at the beginning.

The two women plan Malika's freedom and revenge on her abusers. Hélène tells Malika that her husband was the one who locked the doors of their car during her attack, but Malika doesn't care. Later, she manages to distract Paul at the Basel airport, who looking for his Hélène, and has sex with him. All three manage to get on the same flight back to Paris, with Malika keeping her distance, in order to avoid the police.  Hélène finally stands up to the selfishness of her husband and son. Paul falls madly in love with Malika, going insane when she doesn't call. Fabrice also meets and falls in love with her.

Hélène and Malika set up the pimps and their gang to be arrested by the police. Touki is shot after trying to escape. Malika returns to her estranged family and tells her sister, Zora, that she will be forced into marriage as soon as she's old enough, just as Malika was at her age. To save her from a life of patriarchal misery, she begs her sister to come with her to live in freedom, but she refuses, saying she loves them.

Malika meets up with Paul again and she takes him to his mother's house. When Zora is beaten by her sexist brothers, her father reveals that she will indeed be married to an older man soon. Malika and Hélène rush to Marseilles and stop Malika's father from sending Zora off to a forced marriage. Her father curses her and she replies that it is the first time he has ever given her anything. The film ends with Malika, Hélène, Zora and Paul's mother sitting on a bench gazing at the sun.

'''Children's literature''' or '''juvenile literature''' includes stories, books, magazines, and poems that are enjoyed by children. Modern children's literature is classified in two different ways: genre or the intended age of the reader.

Children's literature can be traced to stories and songs, part of a wider [[oral tradition]], that adults shared with children before publishing existed. The development of early children's literature, before printing was invented, is difficult to trace. Even after printing became widespread, many classic "children's" tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience. Since the fifteenth century much literature has been aimed specifically at children, often with a moral or religious message. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is known as the "Golden Age of Children's Literature", because many classic children's books were published then.

== Introduction ==
There is no single or widely used definition of children's literature.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|15–17}} It can be broadly defined as anything that children read&lt;ref name=nodel&gt;{{cite book|last=Nodelman|first=Perry|title=The Hidden Adult: Defining Children's Literature|year= 2008|publisher= [[JHU]]|page=4| url=https://books.google.com/?id=wKosfJZhUwQC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-8018-8980-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more specifically defined as [[fiction]], [[non-fiction]], [[poetry]], or [[drama]] intended for and used by children and young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Library of Congress|title=Children's Literature|url=https://www.loc.gov/acq/devpol/chi.pdf|work=LIbrary of Congress Collections Policy Statement|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20thc&gt;{{cite book|last= Chevalier|first= Tracy|title=Twentieth-Century Children's Writers|year=1989|publisher=[[St. James Press]]|location= [[Chicago]]|isbn= 0-912289-95-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xvii}} One writer on children's literature defines it as "all books written for children, excluding works such as [[comic book]]s, joke books, [[cartoon book]]s, and non-fiction works that are not intended to be read from front to back, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference materials".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2006, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others would argue that comics should also be included: "Children's Literature studies has traditionally treated comics fitfully and superficially despite the importance of comics as a global phenomenon associated with children".&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, C. "Abstract":, "Comic Art, Children's Literature, and the New Comic Studies." ''The Lion and the Unicorn'', vol. 30 no. 3, 2006, pp. 360-382. Project MUSE, doi:10.1353/uni.2006.0031 [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/202582/pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'' notes that "the boundaries of [[genre]]&amp;nbsp;... are not fixed but blurred".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first= Peter (editor)|title= International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature|year=1996|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P74RiK3CRGkC&amp;pg=PP4|isbn= 978-0-203-16812-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Sometimes, no agreement can be reached about whether a given work is best categorized as literature for adults or children. Some works defy easy categorization. [[J.K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series was written and marketed for young adults, but it is also popular among adults. The series' extreme popularity led ''[[The New York Times]]'' to create a separate best-seller list for children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|title=The ''Times'' Plans a Children's Best-Seller List|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 24, 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/books/the-times-plans-a-children-s-best-seller-list.html|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the widespread association of children's literature with picture books, spoken narratives existed before [[printing]], and the root of many children's tales go back to ancient storytellers.&lt;ref name=Arbuth&gt;{{cite book|last=Arbuthnot|first=May Hill|title=Children and Books|year=1964|publisher=[[Scott, Foresman Publishers|Scott, Foresman]]|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} [[Seth Lerer]], in the opening of ''Children's Literature: A Reader's History from Aesop to Harry Potter'', says, "This book presents a history of what children have heard and read&amp;nbsp;... The history I write of is a history of ''reception''."&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|2}}

== History ==
&lt;!--Note to future editors: This should not be a list of books published but an encyclopedic summary of significant advances and changes around the world. Please keep this from becoming a mere list. See note on talk page for order of information for this section--&gt;
Early children's literature consisted of spoken stories, songs, and poems that were used to educate, instruct, and entertain children.&lt;ref name=random&gt;{{cite web|title=To Instruct and Delight A History of Children's Literature| url=http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/024children.html|publisher=Randon History|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was only in the eighteenth century, with the development of the concept of childhood, that a separate genre of children's literature began to emerge, with its own divisions, expectations, and [[Western canon|canon]].&lt;ref name=nikola&gt;{{cite book|last= Nikolajeva|first= María (editor) |author-link=Maria Nikolajeva |title= Aspects and Issues in the History of Children's Literature|year= 1995|publisher= Greenwood| url=https://books.google.com/?id=ubZL9V1L9fEC&amp;pg=PR9|isbn= 978-0-313-29614-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|x-xi}} The earliest of these books were educational books, books on conduct, and simple ABCs--often decorated with animals, plants, and anthropomorphic letters. &lt;ref&gt;•Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, French historian [[Philippe Ariès]] argues in his book ''[[Centuries of Childhood]]'' that the modern concept of childhood only emerged in recent times. He explains that children were in the past not considered as greatly different from adults and were not given significantly different treatment.&lt;ref name=shav&gt;{{cite book|last= Shavit|first= Zohar|title= Poetics of Children's Literature|year= 2009|publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8203-3481-3| url=https://books.google.com/?id=NerYSgnlnaIC&amp;pg=PP10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} As evidence for this position, he notes that, apart from instructional and didactic texts for children written by [[cleric]]s like [[Bede|the Venerable Bede]] and [[Ælfric of Eynsham]], there was a lack of any genuine literature aimed specifically at children before the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMunn|first=Meradith Tilbury|author2=William Robert McMunn|title=Children's Literature in the Middle Ages|journal=[[Children's Literature (journal)|Children's Literature]]|year=1972|volume= 1|pages=21| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/chl/summary/v001/1.mcmunn.html|accessdate=17 July 2012|doi=10.1353/chl.0.0064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brad&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Johanna|title=From Chapbooks to Plumb Cake: The History of Children's Literature|year=2007|publisher=[[ProQuest]]|isbn=978-0-549-34070-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=65KJo_XpLoYC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

Other scholars have qualified this viewpoint by noting that there was a literature designed to convey the values, attitudes, and information necessary for children within their cultures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Wyile|first= Andrea Schwenke (editor)|title=Considering Children's Literature: A Reader|year=2008|publisher=Broadview|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MWTY0BK5jbIC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the ''[[Play of Daniel]]'' from the 12th century.&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|46}}&lt;ref name=kline&gt;{{cite book|last= Kline|first= Daniel T.|title= Medieval Literature for Children|year= 2003|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn= 978-0-8153-3312-8| url=https://books.google.com/?id=TcxBsWXg9mYC&amp;pg=PR4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Pre-modern children's literature, therefore, tended to be of a [[didactic]] and [[Morality|moralistic]] nature, with the purpose of conveying [[Conduct book|conduct]]-related, educational and [[Religious book|religious]] lessons.&lt;ref name=kline /&gt;{{rp|6–8}}

=== Early-modern Europe ===
[[File:Hornbook Mexican.png|left|thumb|An early Mexican [[hornbook]] pictured in Tuer's ''History of the Horn-Book'', 1896.]]
During the 17th century, the concept of childhood began to emerge in Europe. Adults saw children as separate beings, innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them.&lt;ref name=shav /&gt;{{rp|6–7}}&lt;ref name=reynolds&gt;{{cite book|last= Reynolds|first= Kimberley|title= Children's Literature: A Very Short Introduction|year=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} The English philosopher [[John Locke]] developed his theory of the [[tabula rasa]] in his 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.  In Locke's philosophy, ''tabula rasa'' was the theory that the (human) mind is at birth a "blank slate" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's [[sense|sensory]] experiences. A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions. Locke himself emphasized the importance of providing children with "easy pleasant books" to develop their minds rather than using force to compel them; "children may be cozen'd into a knowledge of the letters; be taught to read, without perceiving it to be anything but a sport, and play themselves into that which others are whipp'd for." He also suggested that picture books be created for children.

In the nineteenth century, a few children's titles became famous as classroom reading texts. Among these were the fables of Aesop and Jean de la Fontaine and Charles Perraults's 1697 ''Tales of Mother Goose''&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;. The popularity of these texts led to the creation of a number of nineteenth century fantasy and fairy tales for children which featured magic objects and talking animals. &lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence on this shift in attitudes came from [[Puritanism]], which stressed the importance of individual salvation. Puritans were concerned with the spiritual welfare of their children, and there was a large growth in the publication of "good godly books" aimed squarely at children.&lt;ref name=random /&gt; Some of the most popular works were by [[James Janeway]], but the most enduring book from this movement, still read today, especially In modernised versions, is ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678) by [[John Bunyan]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''The New Amplified Pilgrim's Progress'' (both book and dramatized audio) – as retold by James Pappas. Published by Orion's Gate (1999) and ''The Evergreen Wood: An Adaptation of the "Pilgrim's Progress" for Children'' written by Linda Perry, illustrated by Alan Perry. Published by Hunt &amp; Thorpe, 1997. [[The Pilgrim's Progress#Retellings]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chapbook]]s, pocket-sized pamphlets that were often folded instead of being stitched,&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|32}} were published in Britain; illustrated by [[Woodcut|woodblock printing]], these inexpensive booklets reprinted popular [[ballads]], historical re-tellings, and folk tales. Though not specifically published for children at this time, young people enjoyed the booklets as well.&lt;ref name=reynolds /&gt;{{rp|8}} Johanna Bradley says, in ''From Chapbooks to Plum Cake'', that chapbooks kept imaginative stories from being lost to readers under the strict [[Puritan]] influence of the time.&lt;ref name=brad /&gt;{{rp|17}}
[[File:Aforadam.png|thumb|The New England Primer]]
[[Hornbook]]s also appeared in England during this time, teaching children basic information such as the alphabet and the [[Lord's Prayer]].&lt;ref name=questia&gt;{{cite book|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia: Children's Literature|year=2009|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117011194|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422190423/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=117011194|archive-date=2012-04-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were brought from England to the [[British America|American colonies]] in the mid-17th century. The first such book was a [[catechism]] for children written in verse by the Puritan [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]]. Known as ''[[Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes]]'', it was published in 1646, appearing both in England and [[Boston]]. Another early book, ''[[The New England Primer]]'', was in print by 1691 and used in schools for 100 years. The [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] begins, "In Adam's fall We sinned all&amp;nbsp;...", and continues through the alphabet. It also contained religious maxims, [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]], spelling help and other educational items, all decorated by [[woodcut]]s.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|35}}

In 1634, the ''[[Pentamerone]]'' from Italy became the first major published collection of European folk tales. [[Charles Perrault]] began recording [[fairy tale]]s in France, publishing his first collection in 1697. They were not well received among the French literary society, who saw them as only fit for old people and children. In 1658, Jan Ámos [[Comenius]] in [[Bohemia]] published the informative illustrated ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'', for children under six learning to read. It is considered to be the first picture book produced specifically for children.&lt;ref name=reynolds /&gt;{{rp|7}}

The first [[Denmark|Danish]] children's book was ''The Child's Mirror'' by [[Niels Bredal]] in 1568, an adaptation of a [[Courtesy book]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] priest [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]. ''A Pretty and Splendid Maiden's Mirror'', an adaptation of a [[Germany|German]] book for young women, became the first [[Sweden|Swedish]] children's book upon its 1591 publication.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|700, 706}} Sweden published fables and a children's magazine by 1766.

In [[Italy]], [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] released ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' in the 1550s. Called the first European storybook to contain fairy-tales, it eventually had 75 separate stories and written for an adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Opie |first=Iona |author2=[[Peter Opie]]  |authorlink=Iona Opie |title=The Classic Fairy Tales |page=20|location=Oxford and New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1974 |isbn=0-19-211559-6|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Russia]]'s earliest children's books, [[Primer (textbook)|primers]], appeared in the late 16th century. An early example is ''ABC-Book'', an [[alphabet book]] published by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] in 1571.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} The first [[picture book]] published in Russia, [[Karion Istomin]]'s ''The Illustrated Primer'', appeared in 1694.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} [[Peter the Great]]'s interest in [[Modernization|modernizing]] his country through [[Westernization]] helped Western children's literature dominate the field through the 18th century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}} [[Catherine the Great]] wrote [[Allegory|allegories]] for children, and during her reign, [[Nikolai Novikov]] started the first juvenile magazine in Russia.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|765}}

=== Origins of the modern genre ===
[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|[[Brothers Grimm]], [[Wilhelm Grimm|Wilhelm]] (left) and [[Jakob Grimm]] (right) from an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]

The modern children's book emerged in mid-18th-century England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-the-newbery-award-got-its-name/|title=How the Newbery Award Got Its Name}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing [[politeness|polite]] middle-class and the influence of [[John Locke|Lockean]] theories of childhood innocence combined to create the beginnings of childhood as a concept. ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'', written and published by [[John Newbery]], is widely considered the first modern children's book, published in 1744. It was a landmark as the first children's publication aimed at giving enjoyment to children,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kodomo.go.jp/ingram/e/section1/index.html|title=Early Children's Literature: From moralistic stories to narratives of everyday life}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing a mixture of rhymes, picture stories and games for pleasure.&lt;ref name=marks&gt;{{cite book|last= Marks|first= Diana F.|title=Children's Book Award Handbook|year= 2006|publisher= [[Libraries Unlimited]]|location= Westport, Conn|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery believed that play was a better enticement to children's good behavior than physical discipline,&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, John Rowe. ''Written for Children''. (1990). New York: HarperCollins. {{ISBN|0-06-446125-4}}, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the child was to record his or her behavior daily.

The book was child–sized with a brightly colored cover that appealed to children—something new in the publishing industry. Known as gift books, these early books became the precursors to the [[toy book]]s popular in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Lundin"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lundin, Anne H. |year=1994 |title=Victorian Horizons: The Reception of Children's Books in England and America, 1880–1900 |journal=The Library Quarterly |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |volume=64 |issue= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newbery was also adept at marketing this new genre. According to the journal ''[[The Lion and the Unicorn (journal)|The Lion and the Unicorn]]'', "Newbery's genius was in developing the fairly new product category, children's books, through his frequent advertisements&amp;nbsp;... and his clever ploy of introducing additional titles and products into the body of his children's books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Susina|first= Jan|title= Editor's Note: Kiddie Lit(e): The Dumbing Down of Children's Literature |journal= The Lion and the Unicorn |date=June 1993|volume= 17|issue= 1|pages= v–vi| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/uni/summary/v017/17.1.susina.html| accessdate=30 July 2012 |doi=10.1353/uni.0.0256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;



The improvement in the quality of books for children, as well as the diversity of topics he published, helped make Newbery the leading producer of children's books in his time. He published his own books as well as those by authors such as [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[Oliver Goldsmith]];&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|36}}&lt;ref name="Rose, 219"&gt;Rose, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; the latter may have written ''[[The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes]]'', Newbery's most popular book.

Another philosopher who influenced the development of children's literature was [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who argued that children should be allowed to develop naturally and joyously. His idea of appealing to a children's natural interests took hold among writers for children.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|41}} Popular examples included [[Thomas Day]]'s ''[[The History of Sandford and Merton]]'', four volumes that embody Rousseau's theories. Furthermore, [[Maria Edgeworth|Maria]] and [[Richard Lovell Edgeworth]]'s ''[[Practical Education]]: The History of Harry and Lucy'' (1780) urged children to teach themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Leader, Zachary, ''Reading Blake's Songs'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7Q9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 p.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau's ideas also had great influence in Germany, especially on [[Philanthropinum|German Philanthropism]], a movement concerned with reforming both education and literature for children. Its founder, [[Johann Bernhard Basedow]], authored ''Elementarwerk'' as a popular textbook for children that included many illustrations by [[Daniel Chodowiecki]]. Another follower, [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]], created an adaptation of ''Robinson Crusoe'' that went into over 100 printings. He became Germany's "outstanding and most modern"&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|736}} writer for children. According to Hans-Heino Ewers in ''The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "It can be argued that from this time, the history of European children's literature was largely written in Germany."&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|737}}

The [[Brothers Grimm]] preserved and published [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|the traditional tales]] told in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Silvey&gt;{{cite book|last=Silvey|first=Anita (editor)|title=The Essential Guide to Children's Books and their Creators|year= 2002|publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin]]|location= New York|isbn=0-618-19082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|184}} They were so popular in their home country that modern, realistic children's literature began to be looked down on there. This dislike of non-traditional stories continued there until the beginning of the next century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|739–740}} The Grimms's contribution to children's literature goes beyond their collection of stories, as great as that is. As professors, they had a scholarly interest in the stories, striving to preserve them and their variations accurately, recording their sources.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|259}} 

A similar project was carried out by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] scholars [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]], who collected Norwegian fairy tales and published them as ''[[Norwegian Folktales]]'', often referred to as ''Asbjørnsen and Moe''. By compiling these stories, they preserved Norway's literary heritage and helped create the Norwegian written language.&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|260}}

Danish author and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]] traveled through Europe and gathered many well-known fairy tales and created new stories in the fairy tale genre.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;Elias Bredsdorff, ''Hans Christian Andersen: the story of his life and work 1805–75'', Phaidon (1975) {{ISBN|0-7148-1636-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Switzerland]], [[Johann David Wyss]] published ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' in 1812, with the aim of teaching children about family values, good husbandry, the uses of the natural world and self-reliance. The book became popular across Europe after it was translated into French by [[Isabelle de Montolieu]].

[[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s tale "[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]" was published in 1816 in a German collection of stories for children, ''Kinder-Märchen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nutcracker|last=Hoffmann|first=E.

=== Golden age ===
The shift to a modern genre of children's literature occurred in the mid-19th century; [[didacticism]] of a previous age began to make way for more humorous, child-oriented books, more attuned to the child's imagination. The availability of children's literature greatly increased as well, as paper and [[printing]] became widely available and affordable, the population grew and literacy rates improved.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|654–655}}

''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' by [[Thomas Hughes]] appeared in 1857, and is considered to be the founding book in the [[school story]] tradition.&lt;ref name=knowles&gt;{{cite book|last= Knowles|first= Murray|title= Language and Control in Children's Literature|year= 1996|publisher= [[Psychology Press]]| url=https://books.google.com/?id=2mh6pCDCZ5EC&amp;pg=PP7|isbn= 978-0-203-41975-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}} However, it was [[Lewis Carroll]]'s fantasy, ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', published in 1865 in England, that signaled the change in writing style for children to an imaginative and empathetic one. Regarded as the first "English masterpiece written for children"&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|44}} and as a founding book in the development of fantasy literature, its publication opened the "First Golden Age" of children's literature in Britain and Europe that continued until the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=knowles /&gt;{{rp|18}} Another important book of that decade was ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby]]'', by Reverend [[Charles Kingsley]] (1862), which became extremely popular in England, and remains a classic of British children's literature.

In 1883, [[Carlo Collodi]] wrote the first Italian fantasy novel, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', which was translated many times. In that same year, [[Emilio Salgari]], the man who would become "the adventure writer par excellence for the young in Italy"&lt;ref&gt;Lawson Lucas, A. (1995) "The Archetypal Adventures of Emilio Salgari: A Panorama of his Universe and Cultural Connections New Comparison", ''A Journal of Comparative and General Literary Studies'', Number 20 Autumn&lt;/ref&gt; first published his legendary character ''[[Sandokan]]''. In Britain, ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Princess and Curdie]]'', by [[George MacDonald]], appeared in 1872 and 1883, and the adventure stories ''[[Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'', both by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], were extremely popular in the 1880s. [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' was first published in 1894, and [[J. M. Barrie]] told the story of [[Peter Pan]] in the novel  ''[[Peter and Wendy]]'' in 1911. [[Johanna Spyri]]'s two-part novel ''[[Heidi]]'' was published in Switzerland in 1880 and 1881.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|749}} In the US, children's publishing entered a period of growth after the [[American Civil War]] in 1865. Boys' book writer [[William Taylor Adams|Oliver Optic]] published over 100 books. In 1868, the "epoch-making book"&lt;ref name=Arbuth /&gt;{{rp|45}} ''[[Little Women]]'', the fictionalized autobiography of [[Louisa May Alcott]], was published. This "[[coming of age]]" story established the genre of realistic family books in the United States. [[Mark Twain]] released ''[[Tom Sawyer]]'' in 1876, and in 1880 another bestseller, ''[[Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings]]'', a collection of [[African American]] folk tales adapted and compiled by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], appeared.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|478}}

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a plethora of children's novels began featuring realistic, non-magical plotlines. Certain titles received international success such as Robert Louis Stevenson's ''Treasure Island'' (1883), L.M. Montgomery's ''Anne of Green Gables'' (1908), and Louisa May Alcott's ''Little Women'' (1869) &lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. 2011. Books: a living history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

== National traditions ==

=== China ===
The Chinese [[Revolution of 1911]] and [[World War II]] brought political and social change that revolutionized children's literature in China. Western science, technology, and literature became fashionable. China's first modern publishing firm, [[Commercial Press]], established several children's magazines, which included ''Youth Magazine'', and ''Educational Pictures for Children''.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|832–833}} The first Chinese children's writer was [[Sun Yuxiu]], an editor of Commercial Press, whose story ''The Kingdom Without a Cat'' was written in the language of the time instead of the classical style used previously. Yuxiu encouraged novelist [[Mao Dun|Shen Dehong]] to write for children as well. Dehong went on to rewrite 28 stories based on classical Chinese literature specifically for children. In 1932, [[Zhang Tianyi]] published ''Big Lin and Little Lin'', the first full-length Chinese novel for children.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|833–834}}

The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution of 1949]] changed children's literature again. Many children's writers were denounced, but Tianyi and [[Ye Shengtao]] continued to write for children and created works that aligned with [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideology. The 1976 death of [[Mao Zedong]] provoked more changes that swept China. Many writers from the early part of the century were brought back, and their work became available again. In 1990, ''General Anthology of Modern Children's Literature of China'', a fifteen-volume anthology of children's literature since the 1920s, was released.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|834–835}}

Literature for children developed as a separate category of literature especially in the [[Victorian era]]. Some works became internationally known, such as those of [[Lewis Carroll]], ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. At the end of the Victorian era and leading into the Edwardian era, [[Beatrix Potter]] was an author and illustrator, best known for her children's books, which featured animal characters. In her thirties, Potter published ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' in 1902. Potter eventually went on to publish 23 children's books and become a wealthy woman. Michael O. Tunnell and James S. Jacobs, professors of children’s literature at Brigham Young University, write, "Potter was the first to use pictures as well as words to tell the story, incorporating coloured illustration with text, page for page."&lt;ref name="Tunnell 80–86"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tunnell|first=Michael O.|last2=Jacobs|first2=James S.|date=2013-10-01|title=The Origins and History of American Children's Literature|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/TRTR.1201/abstract|journal=The Reading Teacher|language=en|volume=67|issue=2|pages=80–86|doi=10.1002/TRTR.1201|issn=1936-2714}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another classic of the period is [[Anna Sewell]]'s animal novel ''[[Black Beauty]]'' (1877).

In the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern picture book were illustrated books of poems and short stories produced by English illustrators [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Walter Crane]], and [[Kate Greenaway]]. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. Some British artists made their living illustrating novels and children's books; among them were [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Cicely Mary Barker]], [[W. Heath Robinson]], [[Henry Justice Ford|Henry J. Ford]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], and [[George Cruikshank]].

The [[Kailyard school]] of Scottish writers, notably [[J. M. Barrie]], creator of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' (1904), presented an idealised version of society and brought fantasy and folklore back into fashion. In 1908, [[Kenneth Grahame]] wrote the children's classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' and the [[Scouts]] founder [[Robert Baden-Powell]]'s first book ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' was published. Inspiration for [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s novel ''[[The Secret Garden]]'' (1910) was the [[Great Maytham Hall]] Garden in Kent. In 1920 [[Hugh Lofting]] created the character [[Doctor Dolittle]] who appears in a series of [[Doctor Dolittle#The books|twelve books]].

The Golden Age of Children's Literature ended with [[World War I]] in Great Britain and Europe, and the period before [[World War II]] was much slower in children's publishing. The main exceptions in England were the publications of ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' by [[A. A. Milne]] in 1926, the first ''[[Mary Poppins]]'' book by [[P. L. Travers]] in 1934, ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] in 1937, and the Arthurian novel ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' by [[T. H. White]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Peter (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|978-0-203-16812-7}}, pp. 682-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's [[paperback]] books were first released in England in 1940 under the [[Puffin Books]] imprint, and their lower prices helped make book buying possible for children during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Peter (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature'', pp. 475-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enid Blyton]]'s books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies. Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into almost 90 languages. She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her [[Noddy (character)|Noddy]], [[The Famous Five (novel series)|The Famous Five]], [[The Secret Seven]], and [[The Adventure Series]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Sheila G. (1982), ''The Blyton Phenomenon''. Andre Deutsch, {{ISBN|978-0-233-97441-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these children's stories, ''[[Five on a Treasure Island]]'', was published in 1942.

In the 1950s, the book market in Europe began recovering from the effects of two world wars. An informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the "Inklings". Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. C. S. Lewis published the first installment of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series in 1950 while Tolkien is best known in addition to ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as the author of  ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. (1954) Another significant writer of fantasy stories is [[Alan Garner]] author of ''[[Elidor]]'' (1965), and ''[[The Owl Service]]'' (1967). The latter work is an adaptation of the myth of [[Blodeuwedd]] from the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', set in modern [[Wales]], and for it Garner won the annual [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] from the [[CILIP|Library Association]], recognising the year's best children's book by a British author.&lt;ref name=medal1967&gt;[http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=91 (Carnegie Winner 1967)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106194213/http://www.carnegiegreenaway.org.uk/livingarchive/title.php?id=91 |date=2013-01-06 }}.

[[Mary Norton (author)|Mary Norton]] wrote ''[[The Borrowers]]'' (1952), featuring tiny people who borrow from humans. [[Dodie Smith]]'s ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' was published in 1956. [[Philippa Pearce]]'s ''[[Tom's Midnight Garden]]'' (1958) has him opening the garden door at night and entering into a different age. The heroine of ''[[Charlotte Sometimes (novel)|Charlotte Sometimes]]'' by Penelope Farmer (1969) is already shaken by her arrival in a girls' boarding school when she finds herself waking as another girl in the same bed, but decades earlier. Closer to reality, Jenny in ''[[No One Must Know]]'' (1962) by [[Barbara Sleigh]] is a newcomer in the street who faces a landlord's pet ban. She needs urgent help from nearby children to hide her cat and kittens.

[[Roald Dahl]] rose to prominence with his children's [[fantasy novels]], often inspired from experiences from his childhood, with often unexpected endings, and unsentimental, dark humour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/once-upon-a-time-there-was-a-man-who-liked-to-make-up-stories-2158052.html Once upon a time, there was a man who liked to make up stories ...] ''[[The Independent]]'' (Sunday, 12 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl was inspired to write ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1964), featuring the eccentric candymaker [[Willy Wonka]], having grown up near two chocolate makers in England who often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies into the other's factory. His other works include ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1961), ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' (1971), ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'' (1983), and ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'' (1988).

==== Adventure fiction for children ====
Adventure stories written specifically for children began in the 19th century. Early examples include [[Johann David Wyss]]' ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]'' (1812), [[Frederick Marryat]]'s ''[[The Children of the New Forest]]'' (1847) and [[Harriet Martineau]]'s ''The Peasant and the Prince'' (1856).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Hunt, Peter]]. (Editor). ''Children's literature: an illustrated history''. Oxford University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-212320-3}}  (pp.&amp;nbsp;98–100)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victorian era saw the development of the genre, with [[William Henry Giles Kingston|W.H.G. Kingston]], [[Robert Michael Ballantyne|R. M. Ballantyne]] and [[G. A. Henty]] specializing in the production of adventure fiction for boys.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Butts, Dennis,"Adventure Books" in [[Jack Zipes|Zipes, Jack]], ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature''. Volume One. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-19-514656-1}} (pp.&amp;nbsp;12–16).&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired writers who normally catered to adult audiences to write for children, and an example is [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s (1850–94) classic [[Piracy|pirate]] story ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1883).&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

In the years after the First World War, writers such as [[Arthur Ransome]]  (1884–1967) developed the adventure genre by setting the adventure in Britain rather than distant countries. Ransome began publishing in 1930 his [[Swallows and Amazons]] series of children's books about the school-holiday adventures of children, mostly in the English [[Lake District]] and the [[Norfolk Broads]]. Many of the books involve sailing; fishing and camping are other common subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Brogan, ''The Life of Arthur Ransome''. Jonathan Cape, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biggles]] was a popular series of [[adventure book]]s for young boys, about James Bigglesworth, a fictional pilot and [[adventurer]], by [[W. E. Johns]]. Biggles made his first appearance in the story ''The White Fokker'', published in the first issue of ''[[Light Aircraft Association|Popular Flying]]'' magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, ''The Camels Are Coming'' (both 1932). Johns continued to write Biggles books until his death in 1968, the series eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes – including novels and short story collections – most of the latter with a common setting and time. These included novels about a woman pilot in the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF), Flight Officer Joan Worralson, better known as "[[Worrals]]".

[[Geoffrey Trease]] and [[Rosemary Sutcliff]]&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 1995, (p.&amp;nbsp;208–9)&lt;/ref&gt; brought a new sophistication to the historical adventure novel.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; [[Philip Pullman]] in the [[Sally Lockhart]] novels and [[Julia Golding]] in the [[Cat Royal]] series have continued the tradition of the historical adventure.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

==== Magazines and comics ====
An important aspect of British children's literature has been [[comic books]] and [[List of early-20th-century British children's magazines and annuals|magazines]]. Amongst the most popular comics have been ''[[The Dandy]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-19284222 BBC News, 16 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Beano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/pixar/11766202/Was-Pixars-Inside-Out-inspired-by-The-Beano.html ''The Telegraph'', 27 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Important early magazines or [[story papers]] for older children were the ''[[Boys Own Paper]]'', which was published from 1879 to 1967&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data071.html#BOYSOWNMAGAZINEUK Galatic Central]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Girl's Own Paper]]'' published from 1880 until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data207.html Galatic Central]&lt;/ref&gt; Other story papers for older boys were ''[[The Hotspur]]'' (1933 to 1959) and ''[[The Rover (story paper)|The Rover]]''–which started in 1922 and was absorbed into ''Adventure'' in 1961 and ''[[The Wizard (DC Comics)|The Wizard]]'' in 1963, and eventually folded in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishcomics.20m.com/home.htm British Comics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many prominent authors contributed to the ''Boys Own Paper'': [[cricket]]er [[W.G. Grace]] wrote for several issues, along with authors [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Jules Verne]] and [[R.M. Ballantyne]], as well as [[Robert Baden-Powell]], the inspiration for the [[Scout Movement]], Between 1941–61 there was 60 issues with stories about [[Biggles]] by [[W. E. Johns]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boysown.info/|title=Boys Own Paper featuring the work of Captain W E Johns|last=rogerharris@biggles.info|website=www.boysown.info|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1960s occasional contributors included [[Isaac Asimov]] and the respected astronomer [[Patrick Moore]].

Many contributors to ''The Girls Own Paper'' were not known outside the paper's pages but they also included [[Noel Streatfeild]], [[Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd]], [[Rosa Nouchette Carey]], [[Sarah Doudney]] (1841–1926), [[Angela Brazil]], [[Lucy Maud Montgomery]], [[Richmal Crompton]], [[Fanny Fern]], and [[Baroness Orczy]]. Between 1940–47 [[Captain W. E.

The ''[[Eagle (British comics)|Eagle]]'' was a popular British comic for boys, launched in 1950 by [[Marcus Morris (publisher)|Marcus Morris]], an Anglican vicar from Lancashire. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sabin, ''Adult comics: an introduction'' (illustrated ed.), London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1993, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Science museum"&gt;{{Citation | title = Dan Dare and the Birth of Hi-Tech Britain | url = http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/dan_dare.aspx | publisher = sciencemuseum.org.uk | accessdate = 19 June 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100721103622/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/dan_dare.aspx | archivedate = 21 July 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, "[[Dan Dare]], Pilot of the Future", created with meticulous attention to detail.&lt;ref name="ODNB Hampson"&gt;{{Citation | last = Varah | first = Chad | authorlink = Chad Varah | title = Hampson, Frank (1918–1985) | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | year = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31192 | accessdate = 16 June 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/31192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribute"&gt;{{Citation | title = A Tribute to Frank Hampson 1918–1985 | url = http://www.tameside.gov.uk/blueplaque/frankhampson | publisher = tameside.gov.uk | date = 12 September 2007 | accessdate = 24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times Hampson"&gt;{{Citation | last = Crompton | first = Alastair | title = Where Eagle dared | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/598/936/79880174w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS201560409&amp;dyn=5!xrn_10_0_CS201560409&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | publisher = ''The Times'', hosted at infotrac.galegroup.com | date = 25 October 1985 | page = 12 | issue = 62278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular stories included "Riders of the Range" and "P.C. 49".

Children's literature has been a part of American culture since Europeans first settled in America. The earliest books were used as tools to instill self-control in children and preach a life of morality in Puritan society. 18th-century American youth began to shift away from the social upbringing of its European counterpart, bringing about a change in children's literature. It was in this time that ''A Little Book for Little Children'' was written by T.W. in 1712. It includes what is thought to be the earliest nursery rhyme and one of the earliest examples of a text book approaching education from the child's point of view, rather than the adult's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bingham|author2=Scholt|title=Fifteen Centuries of Children's Literature|date=1980|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-22164-2|pages=99,107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous books of American children's literature is [[L. Frank Baum]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', published in 1900. "By combining the English fondness for word play with the American appetite for outdoor adventure", Connie Epstein in ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature'' says Baum "developed an original style and form that stands alone".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|479}} Baum wrote fourteen more Oz novels, and other writers continued the [[List of Oz books|Oz series]] into the twenty-first century.

Demand continued to grow in [[North America]] between World War I and World War II, helped by the growth of libraries in both Canada and the United States. Children's reading rooms in libraries, staffed by specially trained librarians, helped create demand for classic juvenile books. Reviews of children's releases began appearing regularly in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and in ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' magazine began to regularly publish reviews of children's releases, and the first Children's Book Week was launched in 1919. In that same year, [[Louise Seaman Bechtel]] became the first person to head a juvenile book publishing department in the country. She was followed by [[May Massee]] in 1922, and [[Alice Dalgliesh]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|479–480}}

The [[American Library Association]] began awarding the [[Newbery Medal]], the first children's book award, in 1922.&lt;ref name=newbery&gt;{{cite web|title=Newbery Awards|url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal|accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caldecott Medal]] for illustration followed in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caldecott Medal Awards |url=http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/caldecotthonors/caldecottmedal#30s |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first book by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]] about her life on the [[American frontier]], ''[[Little House in the Big Woods]]'' appeared in 1932.&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|471}} In 1937 [[Theodor Seuss Geisel|Dr. Seuss]] published his first book, entitled, ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]''. The [[young adult book]] market developed during this period, thanks to sports books by popular writer [[John R. Tunis]]', the novel ''[[Seventeenth Summer]]'' by [[Maureen Daly]], and the ''[[Sue Barton (juvenile series)|Sue Barton]]'' nurse book series by [[Helen Dore Boylston]].&lt;ref name=cart&gt;{{cite book|last=Cart|first=Michael|title=Young Adult Literature: From Romance to Realism|year=2010|publisher=[[ALA Editions]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4RJ8rOTTgC|isbn=978-0-8389-1045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

The already vigorous growth in children's books became a boom in the 1950s, and children's publishing became big business.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|481}} In 1952, American journalist [[E. B. White]] published ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'', which was described as "one of the very few books for young children that face, squarely, the subject of death".&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|467}} [[Maurice Sendak]] illustrated more than two dozen books during the decade, which established him as an innovator in book illustration.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|481}} The [[Sputnik crisis]] that began in 1957, provided increased interest and government money for schools and libraries to buy science and math books and the non-fiction book market "seemed to materialize overnight".&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|482}}

The 1960s saw an age of new realism in children's books emerge. Given the atmosphere of social revolution in 1960s America, authors and illustrators began to break previously established taboos in children's literature. Controversial subjects dealing with alcoholism, death, divorce, and child abuse were now being published in stories for children. Maurice Sendak's ''[[Where the Wild Things Are]]'' in 1963 and [[Louise Fitzhugh]]'s ''[[Harriet the Spy]]'' in 1964 are often considered the first stories published in this new age of realism.&lt;ref name="Tunnell 80–86" /&gt;

[[Esther Forbes]] in ''[[Johnny Tremain]]'' (1943) and [[Mildred D. Taylor]] in ''[[Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry]]'' (1976) continued the tradition of the historical adventure in an American setting.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt; The modern children's adventure novel sometimes deals with controversial issues like terrorism, as in [[Robert Cormier]]'s ''[[After the First Death]]'' in 1979, and warfare in the [[Third World]], as in [[Peter Dickinson]]'s ''AK'' in 1990.&lt;ref name="oxford" /&gt;

In books for a younger age group, Bill Martin and John Archambault's ''[[Chicka Chicka Boom Boom]]'' (1979) presented a new spin on the [[alphabet book]]. [[Laura Numeroff]] published ''[[If You Give a Mouse a Cookie]]'' in 1985 and went on to create a series of similarly named books that is still popular for children and adults to read together.

[[Lloyd Alexander]]'s [[The Chronicles of Prydain]] (1964-1968) was set in a fictionalized version of medieval Britain.

=== Continental Europe ===
The period from 1890 until [[World War I]] is considered the Golden Age of Children's Literature in [[Scandinavia]]. [[Erik Werenskiold]], [[Theodor Kittelsen]], and [[Dikken Zwilgmeyer]] were especially popular, writing folk and fairy tales as well as realistic fiction. The 1859 translation into English by [[George Webbe Dasent]] helped increase the stories' influence.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hunt, (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis, p. 705,&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential and internationally most successful Scandinavian children's books from this period is [[Selma Lagerlöf]]s ''[[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils]]''. [[Astrid Lindgren]] (''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'') and [[Jostein Gaarder]] (''[[Sophie's World]]'') are two of the best-known Scandinavian writers internationally.

The interwar period saw a slow-down in output similar to Britain, although "one of the first mysteries written specifically for children," ''[[Emil and the Detectives]]'' by [[Erich Kästner]], was published in Germany in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Silvey, (editor) (2002). ''The Essential Guide to Children's Books and their Creators''. New York: Houghton Mifflin, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;  German writers [[Michael Ende]] (''[[The Neverending Story]]'') and [[Cornelia Funke]] (''[[Inkheart]]'') achieved international success with their fantasy books.

The period during and following World War II became the Classical Age of the picture book in Switzerland, with works by [[Alois Carigiet]], [[Felix Hoffmann (illustrator)|Felix Hoffmann]], and [[Hans Fischer (painter)|Hans Fischer]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hunt, (editor) (1996). ''International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature''. Taylor &amp; Francis. pp. 683–685, 399, 692, 697, 750.&lt;/ref&gt; 1963 was the first year of the [[Bologna Children's Book Fair]] in Italy, which was described as "the most important international event dedicated to the children's publishing".&lt;ref name=bologna&gt;{{cite web|title=Italy {{!}} Bologna Children's Book Fair|url=http://culture360.org/event/italy-bologna-childrens-book-fair/|publisher=Culture360|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For four days it brings together writers, illustrators, publishers, and book buyers from around the world.&lt;ref name=bologna /&gt;

Swiss author Marcus Pfister's ''[[Rainbow Fish]]'' series has received international acclaim since 1992.

[[File:Stamp-russia2010-children-books-block.png|thumb|Postal stamp of Russia celebrating children's books.]]

[[Russian folktale]]s were collected by [[Aleksandr Afanasyev]] in his three volume ''Narodnye russkie skazki'', and a selection of these were published in ''Русские детские сказки'' (Russian Children's Fairy Tales) in 1871. By the 1860s, [[literary realism]] and non-fiction dominated children's literature. More schools were started, using books by writers like [[Konstantin Ushinsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]], whose ''Russian Reader'' included an assortment of stories, fairy tales, and fables. Books written specifically for girls developed in the 1870s and 1880s. Publisher and journalist [[Evgenia Tur]] wrote about the daughters of well-to-do landowners, while [[Alexandra Nikitichna Annenskaya]]'s stories told of middle-class girls working to support themselves. [[Vera Zhelikhovsky]], [[Elizaveta Kondrashova]], and [[Nadezhda Lukhmanova]] also wrote for girls during this period.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|767}}

Children's non-fiction gained great importance in Russia at the beginning of the century. A ten-volume children's encyclopedia was published between 1913 and 1914. [[Vasily Avenarius]] wrote fictionalized biographies of important people like [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Alexander Pushkin]] around the same time, and scientists wrote for books and magazines for children. Children's magazines flourished, and by the end of the century there were 61. [[Lidia Charskaya]] and {{ill|Klavdiya Lukashevich|ru|Лукашевич, Клавдия Владимировна}} continued the popularity of girls' fiction. [[Realism (literature)|Realism]] took a gloomy turn by frequently showing the maltreatment of children from lower classes. The most popular boys' material was [[Sherlock Holmes]], and similar stories from detective magazines.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|768}}

The state took control of children's literature during the [[October Revolution]]. [[Maksim Gorky]] edited the first children's, ''Northern Lights'', under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule. People often label the 1920s as the Golden Age of Children's Literature in Russia.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|769}} [[Samuil Marshak]] led that literary decade as the "founder of (Soviet) children's literature".&lt;ref name=shray&gt;{{cite book|last=Shrayer|first=Maxim (editor)|title=An Anthology of Jewish-Russian Literature: 1801–1953|year=2007|publisher=[[M.

In 1932, professional writers in the Soviet Union formed the [[USSR Union of Writers]], which served as the writer's organization of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. With a children's branch, the official oversight of the professional organization brought children's writers under the control of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|state]] and the police. [[Communism|Communist principles]] like [[Common ownership|collectivism]] and [[solidarity]] became important themes in children's literature. Authors wrote biographies about revolutionaries like [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and [[Pavlik Morozov]]. [[Alexander Belyayev]], who wrote in the 1920s and 1930s, became Russia's first [[science fiction]] writer.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|770}} According to Ben Hellman in the ''International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "war was to occupy a prominent place in juvenile reading, partly compensating for the lack of adventure stories", during the Soviet Period.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|771}} More political changes in Russia after [[World War II]] brought further change in children's literature. Today, the field is in a state of flux because some older authors are being rediscovered and others are being abandoned.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|772}}

In Brazil, [[Monteiro Lobato]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lobato.globo.com/ MONTEIRO LOBATO]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote a series of 23 books for children known as [[Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (novel series)|Sítio do Picapau Amarelo]] (The Yellow Woodpecker Ranch), between 1920 and 1940. The series is considered representative of Brazilian children's literature and the Brazilian equivalent to children's classics such as [[C. S. Lewis]], [[The Chronicles of Narnia]] and [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]] series.{{according to whom|date=January 2017}} The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato's 1920 short story "A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado", and was later republished as the first chapter of "Reinações de Narizinho", which is the first novel of the series.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The main setting is the "Sítio do Picapau Amarelo", where a boy (Pedrinho), a girl (Narizinho) and their living and thinking anthropomorphic toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning. On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as [[Neverland]], the mythological [[Ancient Greece]], an underwater world known as "Reino das Águas Claras" (Clear Waters Kingdom), and even the outer space. The "Sítio" is often symbolized by the character of [[Emilia (Sítio do Picapau Amarelo)|Emília]], Lobato's most famous creation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Christian missionaries]] first established the [[Calcutta School-Book Society]] in the 19th century, creating a separate genre for children's literature in that country. Magazines and books for children in native languages soon appeared.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|808}} In the latter half of the century, [[Raja Shivprasad]] wrote several well-known books in [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|810}} A number of respected [[Bengali language|Bengali]] writers began producing [[Bengali literature]] for children including [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], who translated some stories and wrote others himself. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Rabindranath Tagore]] wrote plays, stories, and poems for children, including one work illustrated by painter [[Nandalal Bose]]. They worked from the end of the 19th century into the beginning of the 20th century. Tagore's work was later translated into English, with Bose's pictures.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811}} [[Behari Lal Puri]] was the earliest writer for children in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].

The first full-length children's book was ''Khar Khar Mahadev'' by [[Narain Dixit]], which was serialized in one of the popular children's magazines in 1957. Other writers include [[Premchand]], and poet [[Sohan Lal Dwivedi]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811}} In 1919, [[Sukumar Ray]] wrote and illustrated [[Nonsense verse|nonsense rhymes]] in the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language, and children's writer and artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]] finished ''Barngtarbratn''. Bengali children's literature flourished in the later part of the twentieth century. Educator [[Gijubhai Badheka]] published over 200 books in the [[Children's literature in Gujarati language]], and many of them are still popular.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|812}} Other popular Gujarati children's authors were [[Ramanlal Soni]] and [[Jivram Joshi]]. In 1957, political cartoonist [[K. Shankar Pillai]] founded the [[Children's Book Trust]] publishing company. The firm became known for high quality children's books, and many of them were released in several languages. One of the most distinguished writers is Pandit [[Krushna Chandra Kar]] in [[Oriya literature]], who wrote many good books for children, including ''Pari Raija'', ''Kuhuka Raija'', ''Panchatantra'', and ''Adi Jugara Galpa Mala''. He wrote biographies of many historical personalities, such as ''Kapila Deva''. In 1978, the firm organized a writers' competition to encourage quality children's writing. The following year, the Children's Book Trust began a writing workshop and organized the First International Children's Book Fair in [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|809}} Children's magazines, available in many languages, were widespread throughout India during this century.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|811–820}}

Originally, for centuries, stories were told by Africans in their native languages, many being told during social gatherings. Stories varied between mythic narratives dealing with creation and basic proverbs showcasing human wisdom. These narratives were passed down from generation to generation orally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shafii|first1=Zainab|title=Aesthetics of Children’s Literature in Nigeria: a Study of Selected Books|url=http://kubanni.abu.edu.ng:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/7940/1/AESTHETICS%20OF%20CHILDREN%E2%80%99S%20LITERATURE%20IN%20NIGERIA%20A%20STUDY%20OF%20SELECTED%20BOOKS.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805183328/http://kubanni.abu.edu.ng:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/7940/1/AESTHETICS%20OF%20CHILDREN%E2%80%99S%20LITERATURE%20IN%20NIGERIA%20A%20STUDY%20OF%20SELECTED%20BOOKS.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 August 2017|publisher=Zainab Shafii|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its Independence in 1960, Nigeria has witnessed a rise in the production of children's literature by its people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Umer|first1=Marie Linton|title=Children’s Literature in Nigeria Revolutionary Omissions|date=1997|pages=191–206|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18757421-90000224|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the past three decades contributing the most to the genre.

== Classification ==
Children's literature can be divided into categories, either according to [[Literary genre|genre]] or the intended age of the reader.
[[File:The return of Rama.jpg|thumb|A [[Abanindranath Tagore|Tagore]] illustration of a Hindu myth]]

=== By genre ===
A literary genre is a category of literary compositions. Genres may be determined by technique, tone, content, or length.  According to Anderson,&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson 2006&lt;/ref&gt; there are six categories of children's literature (with some significant subgenres):
* [[Picture books]], including concept books that teach the [[alphabet]] or [[counting]] for example, pattern books, and wordless books.
* [[Literature|Traditional literature]], including folktales, which convey the legends, customs, superstitions, and beliefs of people in previous civilizations. This genre can be further broken into subgenres: [[myth]]s, [[fable]]s, [[legend]]s, and [[fairy tale]]s
* [[Fiction]], including [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]], [[Literary realism|realistic fiction]], and [[historical fiction]]
* [[Non-fiction]]
* [[Biography]] and [[autobiography]]
* [[Poetry]] and verse.

=== By age category ===
The criteria for these divisions are vague, and books near a borderline may be classified either way. Books for younger children tend to be written in simple language, use large print, and have many illustrations. Books for older children use increasingly complex language, normal print, and fewer (if any) illustrations. The categories with an age range are listed below:
* [[Picture book]]s, appropriate for pre-readers or children ages 0–5.
* [[Early reader]] books, [[appropriate for children]] ages 5–7.  These books are often designed to help a child build his or her reading skills.
* [[Chapter book]]s, appropriate for children ages 7–12.
** Short chapter books, appropriate for children ages 7–9.
** Longer chapter books, appropriate for children ages 9–12.
* [[Young adult fiction]], appropriate for children ages 12–18.

Pictures have always accompanied children's stories.&lt;ref name=lerer&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerer|first=Seth|title=Children's Literature: A Reader's History, from Aesop to Harry Potter|year=2008|publisher=University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|320}} A [[papyrus]] from [[Diocese of Egypt (Late Antiquity)|Byzantine Egypt]], shows illustrations accompanied by the story of [[Hercules]]' labors.&lt;ref&gt;Cribiore, Raffaella, ''Gymnastics of the Mind'', pg. 139 [[Princeton University]], 2001, cited in Lerer, Seth, ''Children's Literature'', pg. 22, [[University of Chicago]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern children's books are [[illustration|illustrated]] in a way that is rarely seen in adult literature, except in [[graphic novel]]s. Generally, artwork plays a greater role in books intended for younger readers (especially pre-literate children). Children's picture books often serve as an accessible source of high quality art for young children. Even after children learn to read well enough to enjoy a story without illustrations, they continue to appreciate the occasional drawings found in chapter books.

According to Joyce Whalley in ''The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'', "an illustrated book differs from a book with [[illustration]]s in that a good illustrated book is one where the pictures enhance or add depth to the text."&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|221}} Using this definition, the first illustrated children's book is considered to be ''[[Orbis Pictus]]'' which was published in 1658 by the [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravian]] author [[Comenius]]. Acting as a kind of encyclopedia,''Orbis Pictus'' had a picture on every page, followed by the name of the object in [[Latin]] and German. It was translated into English in 1659 and was used in homes and schools around Europe and Great Britain for years.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|220}}

Early children's books, such as ''Orbis Pictus'', were illustrated by [[woodcut]], and many times the same image was repeated in a number of books regardless of how appropriate the illustration was for the story.&lt;ref name=lerer /&gt;{{rp|322}} Newer processes, including copper and steel [[engraving]] were first used in the 1830s. One of the first uses of [[Chromolithography]] (a way of making multi-colored prints) in a children's book was demonstrated in ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', published in Germany in 1845. English illustrator [[Walter Crane]] refined its use in children's books in the late 19th century. [[File:Crane frog4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Crane]]'s [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]] illustration for ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]'', 1874.]]

Another method of creating illustrations for children's books was [[etching]], used by [[George Cruikshank]] in the 1850s. By the 1860s, top artists were illustrating for children, including Crane, [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Kate Greenaway]], and [[John Tenniel]]. Most pictures were still black-and-white, and many color pictures were hand colored, often by children.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|224–226}} ''The Essential Guide to Children's Books and Their Creators'' credits Caldecott with "The concept of extending the meaning of text beyond literal visualization".&lt;ref name=Silvey /&gt;{{rp|350}}

Twentieth-century artists such as [[Kay Nielson]], [[Edmund Dulac]], and [[Arthur Rackham]] produced illustrations that are still reprinted today.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|224–227}} Developments in printing capabilities were reflected in children's books. After World War II, [[Offset printing|offset lithography]] became more refined, and painter-style illustrations, such as [[Brian Wildsmith]]'s were common by the 1950s.&lt;ref name="int.comp.ency" /&gt;{{rp|233}}

== Scholarship ==
Professional organizations, dedicated publications, individual researchers and university courses conduct scholarship on children's literature. Scholarship in children's literature is primarily conducted in three different disciplinary fields: literary studies/cultural studies (literature and language departments and humanities), library and information science, and education. (Wolf, et al., 2011).

Typically, children's literature scholars from literature departments in universities (English, German, Spanish, etc. departments), cultural studies, or in the humanities conduct literary analysis of books. This [[literary criticism]] may focus on an author, a thematic or topical concern, genre, period, or literary device and may address issues from a variety of critical stances (poststructural, postcolonial, New Criticism, psychoanalytic, new historicism, etc.). Results of this type of research are typically published as books or as articles in scholarly journals.

The field of Library and Information Science has a long history of conducting research related to children's literature.

Most educational researchers studying children's literature explore issues related to the use of children's literature in classroom settings.  They may also study topics such as home use, children's out-of-school reading, or parents' use of children's books. Teachers typically use children's literature to augment classroom instruction.

Popular classics such as ''[[The Secret Garden]]'', ''[[Pippi Longstocking]]'', ''[[Peter Pan]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' have been criticized for their [[racial stereotyping]].&lt;ref name="cracked.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flood|first1=Alison|title=Pippi Longstocking books charged with racism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/09/pippi-longstocking-books-racism|website=the guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Byrd|first1=M.

The academic journal ''Children’s Literature Review'' provides critical analysis of many well known children’s books. In its 114th volume, the journal discuses the cultural stereotypes in Belgian cartoonist [[Herge]]’s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'' series in reference to its depiction of people from the Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Tintin|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=114|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the scramble for Africa which occurred between the years of 1881 and 1914 there was a large production of children's literature which attempted to create an illusion of what life was like for those who lived on the African continent. This was a simple technique in deceiving those who only relied on stories and secondary resources. Resulting in a new age of books which put a “gloss” on imperialism and its teachings at the time. Thus encouraging the idea that the colonies who were part of the African continent were perceived as animals, savages and un human like. Therefor needing cultured higher class Europeans to share their knowledge and resources with the locals. Also promoting the idea that the people within these places were as exotic as the locations themselves.  &lt;blockquote&gt;Examples of these books include:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Lou lou chez les negres (1929) - lou lou among the blacks
* Baba Diène et Morceau de sucre (1939)
* Original Barbar series promoting the french civilizing mission
* TINTIN au Congo (1931) - Where Tintin goes to teach lessons in Congo about their country, Belgium

Writer Mary Renck Jalongo In ''Young Children and Picture Books'' discusses damaging stereotypes of [[Native Americans in children's literature]], stating repeated depictions of indigenous people as living in the 1800s with feathers and face paint cause children to mistake them as fictional and not as people that still exist today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jalongo|first1=Mary Renck|title=Young Children and Picture Books|date=2004|publisher=National Association for the Education of Young Children|location=Washington, DC|page=39|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depictions of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people in [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]’s ''[[Little House on the Prairie]]'' and [[J.M. Barrie]]’s ''[[Peter Pan]]'' are widely discussed among critics. Wilder’s novel, based on her childhood in America’s midwest in the late 1800s, portrays Native Americans as racialized stereotypes and has been banned in some classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Laura Ingalls Wilder 1867–1957|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=111|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay, ''Somewhere Outside the Forest: Ecological Ambivalence in Neverland from The Little White Bird to Hook'', writer M.

=== The Empire, imperialism and colonialism ===

The presence of [[empire]] as well as pro-colonialist and [[imperialist]] themes in children’s literature have been identified in some of the most well known children’s classics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siecle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Deborah Cogan|last2=Webb|first2=Jean|title=Introducing Children's Literature: From Romanticism to Postmodernism.

In the French illustrator [[Jean de Brunhoff]]’s 1931 picture book ''Histoire de Babar, le petit elephant (The Story of [[Babar the Elephant|Babar]], The Little Elephant)'', prominent themes of [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] have been noted and identified as propaganda. An allegory for French colonialism, Babar easily assimilates himself into the bourgeois lifestyle. It is a world where the elephants who have adapted themselves dominate the animals who have not yet been assimilated into the new and powerful civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Tom|title=Babar|journal=Children's Literature Review|date=2006|volume=116|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WIELAND|first1=RAOUL|title=Babar The Elephant – Racism, Sexism, and Privilege in Children’s Storie|url=http://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/babar-the-elephant-racism-sexism-and-privilege-hesaid/|website=The Good Men Project|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gopnik|first1=Adam|title=Freeing the Elephants: What Babar brought.|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/09/22/freeing-the-elephants|website=The New Yorker|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.

=== Gender roles and representation of women ===
Some of the earliest children’s stories that contain feminist themes are [[Louisa May Alcott]]’s ''[[Little Women]]'' and [[Frank L. Baum]]’s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. With many women of this period being represented in children’s books as doing housework, these two books deviated from this pattern. Drawing attention to the perception of housework as oppressive is one of the earliest forms of the feminist movement. ''Little Women'', a story about four sisters, is said to show power of women in the home and is seen as both conservative and radical in nature. The character of Jo is observed as having a rather contemporary personality and has even been seen as a representation of the feminist movement. It has been suggested that the feminist themes in ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' result from influence of Baum's mother-in law, [[Matilda Gage]], an important figure in the [[suffragist]] movement. Baum's significant political commentary on capitalism, and racial oppression are also said to be part of Gage's influence. Examples made of these themes is the main protagonist, [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] who is punished by being made to do housework. Another example made of positive representations of women is in Finnish author [[Tove Jansson]]'s [[Moomin]] series which features strong and individualized female characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=18–20, 25–45 &amp; 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a surge in the production and availability of [[feminist children's literature]] as well as a rise in [[gender neutrality]] in children's literature.

In addition to perpetuating stereotypes about appropriate behavior and occupations for women and girls, children's books frequently lack female characters entirely, or include them only as minor or unimportant characters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the book ''Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics'', scholar [[Alison Lurie]] says most adventure novels of the 20th century, with few exceptions, contain boy protagonists while female characters in books such as those by [[Dr. Seuss]], would typically be assigned the gender-specific roles of receptionists and nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=43 &amp; 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' characters written by [[A. A. Milne]], are primarily male, with the exception of the character [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]], who is a mother to [[Roo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Alison|title=Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics|date=2003|publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus|location=London|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even animals and inanimate objects are usually identified as being male in children's books.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The near-absence of significant female characters is paradoxical because of the role of women in creating children's literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the one hand ''Growing up with Dick and Jane'' highlights the heterosexual, [[nuclear family]] and also points out the gender-specific duties of the mother, father, brother and sister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kismaric|first1=Carole|last2=Heiferman|first2=Marvin|title=Growing up with Dick and Jane: Learning and Living the American Dream|date=1996|publisher=Collins San Francisco,|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Young Children and Picture Books'', on the other hand, encourages readers to avoid books with women who are portrayed as inactive and unsuccessful as well as intellectually inferior and subservient to their fellow male characters to avoid children’s books that have repressive and [[sexist]] stereotypes for women.&lt;ref name="Young Children and Picture Books" /&gt;

In her book ''Children’s Literature: From the fin de siècle to the new millennium'', professor Kimberley Reynolds claims gender division stayed in children's books prominently until the 1990s. She also says that [[capitalism]] encourages gender-specific marketing of books and toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, adventure stories have been identified as being for boys and domestic fiction intended for girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Deborah Cogan|last2=Webb|first2=Jean|title=Introducing Children's Literature: From Romanticism to Postmodernism. London: Routledge|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Publishers often believe that boys will not read stories about girls, but that girls will read stories about both boys and girls; therefore, a story that features male characters is expected to sell better.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Why are there so few girls in children’s books?|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/08/why-are-there-so-few-girls-in-childrens-books/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2016-01-08|access-date = 2016-01-09|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Jennie|last = Yabroff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in appealing to boys is also seen in the Caldecott awards, which tend to be presented to books that are believed to appeal to boys.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reynolds also says that both boys and girls have been presented by limited representations of appropriate behaviour, identities and careers through the illustrations and text of children’s literature. She argues girls have traditionally been marketed books that prepare them for domestic jobs and motherhood. Conversely, boys are prepared for leadership roles and war.&lt;ref name="Northcote House"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 20th century, more than 5,000 children's picture books were published in the U.S; during that time, male characters outnumbered female characters by more than 3 to 2, and male animals outnumbered female animals by 3 to 1.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=Janice|last2=Fairchild|first2=Emily|last3=Grauerholz|first3=Liz|last4=Pescosolido|first4=Bernice A.|last5=Tope|first5=Daniel|date=31 March 2011|title=Gender in Twentieth-Century Children’s Books:  Patterns of Disparity in Titles and Central Characters|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243211398358|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=25|issue=2|pages=197–226|issn=0891-2432|lay-url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/01/08/why-are-there-so-few-girls-in-childrens-books|lay-source=Why are there so few girls in children's books?|lay-date=8 January 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No children's picture book that featured a protagonist with an identifiable gender contained only female characters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''I’m Glad I’m a Boy! I’m Glad I’m a Girl!'' (1970) by [[Whitney Darrow Jr.]] was criticized for its narrow depictions of careers for both boys and girls. The book informs the reader that boys are doctors, policemen, pilots, and Presidents while girls are nurses, meter maids, stewardesses and First Ladies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Popova|first1=Maria|title=I’m Glad I’m a Boy!

In his article, entitled “Gender Equality: A Case Study of Janaki Sooriyarachichi’s Picture Book ''The Flying Train'',” Dr. Mehdi Ghasemi draws attention to the ways Janaki Sooriyarachchi – the writer and illustrator of ''The Flying Train'' – validates feminine and masculine voices and visions and balances gender issues both in the story book's narratives and illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Ghasemi, Mehdi. “Gender Equality: A Case Study of Janaki Sooriyarachichi’s Picture Book The Flying Train.” Libri &amp; Liberi, vol. 3 (1), 2014: 43-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate over controversial content ===

A widely discussed and debated topic by critics and publishers in the children’s book industry is whether outdated and offensive content, specifically racial stereotypes, should be changed upon the printing of new editions. Some question if certain books should be banned&lt;ref name="Adios Barbie" /&gt; while others believe original content should remain but publishers should make additions that guide parents in conversations with their children about the problematic elements of the particular story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rao|first1=Kavitha|title=Are some children's classics unsuitable for kids?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jul/22/childrens-classics-unsuitable-kids|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marche|first1=Stephen|title=How to Read a Racist Book to Your Kids|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/magazine/how-to-read-a-racist-book-to-your-kids.html?_r=3|website=The New York Times Magazine|publisher=The New York Times Magazine|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see racist stereotypes as cultural artifacts that should be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Children’s Culture Reader'', scholar [[Henry Jenkins]] references [[Herbert Kohl]]’s essay ''Should We Burn Babar?'' which raises the debate whether children should be educated on how to think critically towards oppressive ideologies rather than ignore historical mistakes. Jenkins suggests that parents and educators should trust children to make responsible judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Henry|title=The Children's Cultural Reader|date=1998|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York and London|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some books have been altered in newer editions and significant changes can be seen, such as illustrator [[Richard Scarry]]’s book ''[[Best Word Book Ever]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ha|first1=Thu-Huong|title=Spot the difference: This update to a classic children’s book reimagines gender roles|url=http://qz.com/545860/richard-scarrys-update-to-a-classic-childrens-book-reimagines-gender-roles-for-boys-and-girls/|website=Quartz|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roald Dahl]]’s book ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''.&lt;ref name="The New York Times Magazine" /&gt; In other cases classics have been rewritten into updated versions by new authors and illustrators. Several versions of ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'' have been remade as more appropriate and without prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jalongo|first1=Mary Renck|title=Young Children and Picture Books|date=2004|publisher=National Association for the Education of Young Children|location=Washington, DC|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on early childhood development ===

[[Bruno Bettelheim]] in ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'', uses [[psychoanalysis]] to examine the impact that [[fairy tales]] have on the developing child. Bettelheim states the unconscious mind of a child is affected by the ideas behind a story, which shape their perception and guides their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bettelheim|first1=Bruno|title=The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales|date=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=United States|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, author and illustrator [[Anthony Browne (author)|Anthony Browne]] contends the early viewing of an image in a [[picture book]] leaves an important and lasting impression on a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCorquodale|first1=Duncan|title=Illustrated Children's Books|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Black Dog Publishing|location=London|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research, a child’s most crucial individual characteristics are developed in their first five years. Their environment and interaction with images in picture books have a profound impact on this development and are intended to inform a child about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacCann|first1=Donnarae|last2=Richard|first2=Olga|title=The child's first books; a critical study of pictures and texts|date=1973|publisher=Wilson|location=New York|page=1 &amp; 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children’s literature critic [[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Peter Hunt]] argues that no book is innocent of harbouring an [[ideology]] of the culture it comes from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Peter|title=Literature for Children Contemporary Criticism|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics discuss how an author’s ethnicity, gender and social class inform their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nodelman|first1=Perry|title=The Hidden Adult: Defining Children's Literature|date=2008|publisher=Johns Hopkins United Press|location=Baltimore|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Kimberley Reynolds suggests books can never be neutral as their nature is intended as instructional and by using its language, children are imbedded with the values of that society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming childhood as a culturally constructed concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds states that it is through children’s literature that a child learns how to behave and to act as a child should, according to the expectations of their culture. She also attributes [[capitalism]], in certain societies, as a prominent means of instructing especially middle class children in how to behave.&lt;ref name="Northcote House" /&gt; The "image of childhood"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Kimberley|title=Children's Literature from the Fin De Siècle to the New Millennium|date=2012|publisher=Northcote House|location=Tavistock, Devon, U.K|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is said to be created and perpetuated by adults to affect children "at their most susceptible age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Egoff|first1=Sheila A.|title=Thursday's Child: Trends and Patterns in Contemporary Children's Literature|date=1981|publisher=American Library Association|location=Chicago, Ill|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kate Greenaway]]’s illustrations are used as an example of imagery intended to instruct a child in the proper way to look and behave.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In [[Roberta Seelinger Trites]]'s book ''Disturbing the Universe: Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature'', she also argues adolescence is a social construct established by ideologies present in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trites|first1=Roberta Seelinger|title=Disturbing the Universe Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature|date=2000|publisher=U of Iowa|location=Iowa City|page=xi-xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the study ''The First R: How Children Learn About Race and Racism'', researcher Debra Ausdale studies children in multi-ethnic daycare centres. Ausdale claims children as young as three have already entered into and begun experimenting with the race ideologies of the adult world. She asserts racist attitudes are assimilated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ausdale|first1=Debra|last2=Feagin|first2=Joe R.|title=The First R: How Children Learn Race and Racism|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md}}&lt;/ref&gt; using interactions children have with books as an example of how children internalize what they encounter in real life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ausdale|first1=Debra|last2=Feagin|first2=Joe R.|title=The First R: How Children Learn Race and Racism|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md|pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Color''' ([[American English]]), or '''colour''' ([[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth English]]), is the characteristic of [[humans|human]] [[Color vision|visual perception]] described through color ''categories'', with names such as [[red]], [[orange (colour)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], or [[purple]]. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of [[cone cell]]s in the human eye by [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]]. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.

By defining a [[color space]], colors can be identified numerically by coordinates, which in 1931 were also named in global agreement with internationally agreed color names like mentioned above (red, orange, etc.) by the [[International Commission on Illumination]]. The [[RGB color space]] for instance is a color space corresponding to human [[trichromacy]] and to the three cone cell types that respond to three bands of light: long wavelengths, peaking near 564–580 [[nanometre|nm]] (''red''); medium-wavelength, peaking near 534–545&amp;nbsp;nm (''green''); and short-wavelength light, near 420–440&amp;nbsp;nm (''blue'').&lt;ref name="Wyszecki"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;    There may also be more than three color dimensions in other color spaces, such as in the [[CMYK color model]], wherein one of the dimensions relates to a color's [[colorfulness]]).

The photo-receptivity of the "eyes" of other species also varies considerably from that of humans and so results in correspondingly [[Color vision#In other animal species|different ''color'' perceptions]] that cannot readily be compared to one another.  [[Honey bee|Honeybees]] and [[bumblebees]] for instance have trichromatic color vision sensitive to [[ultraviolet]] but is insensitive to red.

The science of color is sometimes called '''chromatics''', '''[[colorimetry]]''', or simply '''color science'''. It includes the study of the perception of color by the [[human eye]] and brain, the origin of color in materials, [[color theory]] in [[art]], and the [[physics]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the visible range (that is, what is commonly referred to simply as ''[[light]]'').

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] is characterized by its [[wavelength]] (or [[frequency]]) and its [[Luminous intensity|intensity]]. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] to 700&amp;nbsp;nm), it is known as "visible light".

Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's ''spectrum'' is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color [[Wikt:sensation|sensation]] in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called ''[[Metamerism (color)|metamers]]'' of the color in question.

=== Spectral colors ===

The familiar colors of the [[rainbow]] in the [[Optical spectrum|spectrum]]—named using the [[Latin]] word for ''appearance'' or ''apparition'' by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1671—include all those colors that can be produced by [[visible light]] of a single wavelength only, the [[spectral color|''pure spectral'' or ''monochromatic'' colors]]. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in [[hertz|terahertz]]) and wavelengths (in [[nanometre|nanometers]]) for various pure spectral colors. The wavelengths listed are as measured in air or [[vacuum]] (see [[refractive index]]).

The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list—the pure spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors [[language|linguistically]] is a matter of culture and historical contingency (although people everywhere have been shown to ''perceive'' colors in the same way&lt;ref&gt;[[Brent Berlin|Berlin, B.]] and [[Paul Kay|Kay, P.]], ''[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]'', Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, [[indigo]], between blue and violet. It is possible that what Newton referred to as blue is nearer to what today is known as [[cyan]], and that indigo was simply the dark blue of the [[indigo dye]] that was being imported at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldman|first=Gary|title=Introduction to light : the physics of light, vision, and color|year=2002|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-42118-6|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbsoAXWbnr4C&amp;pg=PA193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''intensity'' of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is [[brown]], and a low-intensity yellow-green is [[olive green]].

=== Color of objects ===

The color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain. Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing. Some objects not only reflect light, but also transmit light or emit light themselves, which also contributes to the color. A viewer's perception of the object's color depends not only on the spectrum of the light leaving its surface, but also on a host of contextual cues, so that color differences between objects can be discerned mostly independent of the lighting spectrum, viewing angle, etc. This effect is known as [[color constancy]].

[[File:Optical grey squares orange brown.svg|right|thumb|250px|The upper disk and the lower disk have exactly the same objective color, and are in identical gray surroundings; based on context differences, humans perceive the squares as having different reflectances, and may interpret the colors as different color categories; see [[checker shadow illusion]].]]

Some generalizations of the physics can be drawn, neglecting perceptual effects for now:
* Light arriving at an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] surface is either [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] "[[Specular reflection|specularly]]" (that is, in the manner of a mirror), [[scattering|scattered]] (that is, reflected with diffuse scattering), or [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] – or some combination of these.
* Opaque objects that do not reflect specularly (which tend to have rough surfaces) have their color determined by which wavelengths of light they scatter strongly (with the light that is not scattered being absorbed). If objects scatter all wavelengths with roughly equal strength, they appear white. If they absorb all wavelengths, they appear black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pastoureau|first=Michael|title=Black: The History of a Color|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=216|isbn=978-0691139302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Opaque objects that specularly reflect light of different wavelengths with different efficiencies look like mirrors tinted with colors determined by those differences. An object that reflects some fraction of impinging light and absorbs the rest may look black but also be faintly reflective; examples are black objects coated with layers of enamel or lacquer.
* Objects that [[Transparency and translucency|transmit light]] are either ''translucent'' (scattering the transmitted light) or ''transparent'' (not scattering the transmitted light). If they also absorb (or reflect) light of various wavelengths differentially, they appear tinted with a color determined by the nature of that absorption (or that reflectance).
* Objects may emit light that they generate from having excited electrons, rather than merely reflecting or transmitting light. The electrons may be excited due to elevated temperature (''[[incandescence]]''), as a result of chemical reactions (''[[chemoluminescence]]''), after absorbing light of other frequencies ("[[fluorescence]]" or "[[phosphorescence]]") or from electrical contacts as in [[light emitting diodes]], or other [[list of light sources|light sources]].

To summarize, the color of an object is a complex result of its surface properties, its transmission properties, and its emission properties, all of which contribute to the mix of wavelengths in the light leaving the surface of the object. The perceived color is then further conditioned by the nature of the ambient illumination, and by the color properties of other objects nearby, and via other characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain.

=== Development of theories of color vision ===
{{Main|Color theory}}

Although [[Aristotle]] and other ancient scientists had already written on the nature of light and [[color vision]], it was not until [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] that light was identified as the source of the color sensation. In 1810, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] published his comprehensive ''[[Theory of Colours|Theory of Colors]]'' in which he ascribed physiological effects to color that are now understood as psychological.

In 1801 [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] proposed his [[Trichromacy|trichromatic theory]], based on the observation that any color could be matched with a combination of three lights. This theory was later refined by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]. As Helmholtz puts it, "the principles of Newton's law of mixture were experimentally confirmed by Maxwell in 1856. Young's theory of color sensations, like so much else that this marvelous investigator achieved in advance of his time, remained unnoticed until Maxwell directed attention to it."&lt;ref&gt;Hermann von Helmholtz, ''Physiological Optics – The Sensations of Vision'', 1866, as translated in ''Sources of Color Science'', David L. MacAdam, ed., Cambridge: [[MIT Press]], 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as Helmholtz, [[Ewald Hering]] developed the [[opponent process]] theory of color, noting that [[color blindness]] and afterimages typically come in opponent pairs (red-green, blue-orange, yellow-violet, and black-white). Ultimately these two theories were synthesized in 1957 by Hurvich and Jameson, who showed that retinal processing corresponds to the trichromatic theory, while processing at the level of the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] corresponds to the opponent theory.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S.E. (1999). ''Vision Science: Photons to Phenomenology'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-16183-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, an international group of experts known as the ''Commission internationale de l'éclairage'' ([[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]]) developed a mathematical color model, which mapped out the space of observable colors and assigned a set of three numbers to each.

=== Color in the eye ===
{{Main|Color vision}}

[[File:Cones SMJ2 E.svg|thumb|300px|right|Normalized typical human [[cone cell]] responses (S, M, and L types) to monochromatic spectral stimuli]]

The ability of the [[human eye]] to distinguish colors is based upon the varying sensitivity of different cells in the [[retina]] to light of different [[wavelengths]]. Humans are [[Trichromacy|trichromatic]]—the retina contains three types of color receptor cells, or [[cone cell|cones]]. One type, relatively distinct from the other two, is most responsive to light that is perceived as blue or blue-violet, with wavelengths around 450 [[nanometre|nm]]; cones of this type are sometimes called ''short-wavelength cones'', ''S cones'', or ''blue cones''. The other two types are closely related genetically and chemically: ''middle-wavelength cones'', ''M cones'', or ''green cones'' are most sensitive to light perceived as green, with wavelengths around 540&amp;nbsp;nm, while the ''long-wavelength cones'', ''L cones'', or ''red cones'', are most sensitive to light is perceived as greenish yellow, with wavelengths around 570 &amp;nbsp;nm.

Light, no matter how complex its composition of wavelengths, is reduced to three color components by the eye. Each cone type adheres to the [[principle of univariance]], which is that each cone's output is determined by the amount of light that falls on it over all wavelengths. For each location in the visual field, the three types of cones yield three signals based on the extent to which each is stimulated. These amounts of stimulation are sometimes called ''tristimulus values''.

The response curve as a function of wavelength varies for each type of cone. Because the curves overlap, some tristimulus values do not occur for any incoming light combination. For example, it is not possible to stimulate ''only'' the mid-wavelength (so-called "green") cones; the other cones will inevitably be stimulated to some degree at the same time. The set of all possible tristimulus values determines the human ''color space''. It has been estimated that humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;

The other type of light-sensitive cell in the eye, the [[rod cell|rod]], has a different response curve. In normal situations, when light is bright enough to strongly stimulate the cones, rods play virtually no role in vision at all.&lt;ref&gt;"Under well-lit viewing conditions (photopic vision), cones&amp;nbsp; ...are highly active and rods are inactive." {{cite conference|last=Hirakawa |first=K. |author2=Parks, T.W. |title=Chromatic Adaptation and White-Balance Problem |conference=IEEE ICIP |year=2005 |doi=10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530559 |url=http://www.accidentalmark.com/research/papers/Hirakawa05WBICIP.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128184104/http://www.accidentalmark.com/research/papers/Hirakawa05WBICIP.pdf |archivedate=November 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in dim light, the cones are understimulated leaving only the signal from the rods, resulting in a [[Black-and-white|colorless]] response. (Furthermore, the rods are barely sensitive to light in the "red" range.) In certain conditions of intermediate illumination, the rod response and a weak cone response can together result in color discriminations not accounted for by cone responses alone. These effects, combined, are summarized also in the [[Kruithof curve]], that describes the change of color perception and pleasingness of light as function of temperature and intensity.

=== Color in the brain ===
{{Main|Color vision}}

[[File:Ventral-dorsal streams.svg|thumb|right|300px|The visual [[dorsal stream]] (green) and [[ventral stream]] (purple) are shown. The ventral stream is responsible for color perception.]]

While the mechanisms of color vision at the level of the retina are well-described in terms of tristimulus values, color processing after that point is organized differently. A dominant theory of color vision proposes that color information is transmitted out of the eye by three [[opponent processes]], or opponent channels, each constructed from the raw output of the cones: a red–green channel, a blue–yellow channel, and a black–white "luminance" channel. This theory has been supported by neurobiology, and accounts for the structure of our subjective color experience. Specifically, it explains why humans cannot perceive a "reddish green" or "yellowish blue", and it predicts the [[color wheel]]: it is the collection of colors for which at least one of the two color channels measures a value at one of its extremes.

The exact nature of color perception beyond the processing already described, and indeed the status of color as a feature of the perceived world or rather as a feature of our ''perception'' of the world – a type of [[qualia]] – is a matter of complex and continuing philosophical dispute.

=== Nonstandard color perception ===

==== Color deficiency ====
{{Main|Color blindness}}

If one or more types of a person's color-sensing cones are missing or less responsive than normal to incoming light, that person can distinguish fewer colors and is said to be ''color deficient'' or ''[[color blindness|color blind]]'' (though this latter term can be misleading; almost all color deficient individuals can distinguish at least some colors). Some kinds of color deficiency are caused by anomalies in the number or nature of cones in the retina. Others (like ''central'' or ''cortical'' ''[[achromatopsia]]'') are caused by neural anomalies in those parts of the brain where visual processing takes place.

==== Tetrachromacy ====
{{Main|Tetrachromacy}}

While most humans are ''trichromatic'' (having three types of color receptors), many animals, known as ''[[Tetrachromacy|tetrachromats]]'', have four types. These include some species of [[spider]]s, most [[marsupial]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, and many species of [[fish]]. Other species are sensitive to only two axes of color or do not perceive color at all; these are called ''dichromats'' and ''monochromats'' respectively. A distinction is made between ''retinal tetrachromacy'' (having four pigments in cone cells in the retina, compared to three in trichromats) and ''functional tetrachromacy'' (having the ability to make enhanced color discriminations based on that retinal difference). As many as half of all women are retinal tetrachromats.&lt;ref name="Jameson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jameson |first= K. A. |last2= Highnote |first2= S. M. |last3= Wasserman |first3= L. M.|year = 2001|title = Richer color experience in observers with multiple photopigment opsin genes.|doi = 10.3758/BF03196159|journal = Psychonomic Bulletin and Review|volume = 8|issue = 2|pages = 244–61|url = https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03196159.pdf|format = PDF|pmid = 11495112}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.256}} The phenomenon arises when an individual receives two slightly different copies of the gene for either the medium- or long-wavelength cones, which are carried on the [[X&amp;nbsp;chromosome]]. To have two different genes, a person must have two X&amp;nbsp;chromosomes, which is why the phenomenon only occurs in women.&lt;ref name="Jameson" /&gt; There is one scholarly report that confirms the existence of a functional tetrachromat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=G.|last2=Deeb|first2=S. S.|last3=Bosten|first3=J. M.|last4=Mollon|first4=J. D.|title=The dimensionality of color vision in carriers of anomalous trichromacy|journal=Journal of Vision|date=20 July 2010|volume=10|issue=8|page=12|doi=10.1167/10.8.12|pmid=20884587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Synesthesia ====

In certain forms of [[synesthesia]]/[[ideasthesia]], perceiving letters and numbers ([[grapheme-color synesthesia|grapheme–color synesthesia]]) or hearing musical sounds (music–color synesthesia) will lead to the unusual additional experiences of seeing colors. Behavioral and [[functional neuroimaging]] experiments have demonstrated that these color experiences lead to changes in behavioral tasks and lead to increased activation of brain regions involved in color perception, thus demonstrating their reality, and similarity to real color percepts, albeit evoked through a non-standard route.

=== Afterimages ===

After exposure to strong light in their sensitivity range, [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] of a given type become desensitized. For a few seconds after the light ceases, they will continue to signal less strongly than they otherwise would. Colors observed during that period will appear to lack the color component detected by the desensitized photoreceptors. This effect is responsible for the phenomenon of [[afterimage]]s, in which the eye may continue to see a bright figure after looking away from it, but in a [[complementary color]].

Afterimage effects have also been utilized by artists, including [[Vincent van Gogh]].

=== Color constancy ===
{{Main|Color constancy}}

When an artist uses a limited [[color scheme|color palette]], the [[Human eye|eye]] tends to compensate by seeing any gray or neutral color as the color which is missing from the color wheel. For example, in a limited palette consisting of red, yellow, black, and white, a mixture of yellow and black will appear as a variety of green, a mixture of red and black will appear as a variety of purple, and pure gray will appear bluish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Depauw|first=Robert C.|title=United States Patent|url=http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT3815265&amp;id=tSEzAAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=mixing+paint+colors&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q=mixing%20paint%20colors&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not due to black pigment being dark blue therefore reflecting more blue light? This is a real physical phenomenon and not a perceptual one. Is this paragraph not irrelevant to color constancy? --&gt;

The trichromatic theory is strictly true when the visual system is in a fixed state of adaptation. In reality, the visual system is constantly adapting to changes in the environment and compares the various colors in a scene to reduce the effects of the illumination. If a scene is illuminated with one light, and then with another, as long as the difference between the light sources stays within a reasonable range, the colors in the scene appear relatively constant to us. This was studied by [[Edwin Land]] in the 1970s and led to his retinex theory of [[color constancy]].

Both phenomena are readily explained and mathematically modeled with modern theories of chromatic adaptation and color appearance (e.g. [[CIECAM02]], iCAM).&lt;ref name="CAM"&gt;M.D. Fairchild, [http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470012161.html Color Appearance Models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505034940/http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470012161.html |date=May 5, 2011 }}, 2nd Ed., Wiley, Chichester (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; There is no need to dismiss the trichromatic theory of vision, but rather it can be enhanced with an understanding of how the visual system adapts to changes in the viewing environment.

=== Color naming ===
{{Main|Color term}}
{{See also|Lists of colors|Web colors}}
[[File:1Mcolors.png|thumb|This picture contains one million pixels, each one a different color]]
Colors vary in several different ways, including [[hue]] (shades of [[red]], [[Orange (colour)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], and [[Violet (color)|violet]]), [[saturation (color theory)|saturation]], [[brightness]], and [[Gloss (material appearance)|gloss]]. Some color words are derived from the name of an object of that color, such as "[[Orange (fruit)|orange]]" or "[[Salmon (color)|salmon]]", while others are abstract, like "red".

In the 1969 study ''[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]'', [[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]] describe a pattern in naming "basic" colors (like "red" but not "red-orange" or "dark red" or "blood red", which are "shades" of red). All languages that have two "basic" color names distinguish dark/cool colors from bright/warm colors. The next colors to be distinguished are usually red and then yellow or green. All languages with six "basic" colors include black, white, red, green, blue, and yellow. The pattern holds up to a set of twelve: black, gray, white, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and [[azure (color)|azure]] (distinct from blue in [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], but not English).

=== Associations ===

Individual colors have a variety of cultural associations such as [[national colors]] (in general described in individual color articles and [[color symbolism]]). The field of [[color psychology]] attempts to identify the effects of color on human emotion and activity. [[Chromotherapy]] is a form of [[alternative medicine]] attributed to various Eastern traditions. Colors have different associations in different countries and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalization-group.com/edge/resources/color-meanings-by-culture/|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101012003744/http://www.globalization-group.com/edge/resources/color-meanings-by-culture/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-10-12|title= Chart: Color Meanings by Culture|accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different colors have been demonstrated to have effects on cognition. For example, researchers at the University of Linz in Austria demonstrated that the color red significantly decreases cognitive functioning in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gnambs | first1 = Timo | last2 = Appel | first2 = Markus | last3 = Batinic | first3 = Bernad | year = 2010 | title = Color red in web-based knowledge testing | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 1625–1631 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spectral colors and color reproduction ==

[[File:CIExy1931 fixed.svg|right|thumb|upright|The [[CIE 1931 color space]] [[chromaticity diagram]]. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers. The colors depicted depend on the [[color space]] of the device on which you are viewing the image, and therefore may not be a strictly accurate representation of the color at a particular position, and especially not for monochromatic colors.]]

Most light sources are mixtures of various wavelengths of light. Many such sources can still effectively produce a spectral color, as the eye cannot distinguish them from single-wavelength sources. For example, most computer displays reproduce the spectral color orange as a combination of red and green light; it appears orange because the red and green are mixed in the right proportions to allow the eye's cones to respond the way they do to the spectral color orange.

A useful concept in understanding the perceived color of a non-monochromatic light source is the [[dominant wavelength]], which identifies the single wavelength of light that produces a sensation most similar to the light source. Dominant wavelength is roughly akin to [[hue]].

There are many color perceptions that by definition cannot be pure spectral colors due to [[Saturation (color theory)|desaturation]] or because they are [[purple]]s (mixtures of red and violet light, from opposite ends of the spectrum). Some examples of necessarily non-spectral colors are the achromatic colors (black, gray, and white) and colors such as [[pink]], [[Tan (color)|tan]], and [[magenta]].

Two different light spectra that have the same effect on the three color receptors in the [[human eye]] will be perceived as the same color. They are [[Metamerism (color)|metamers]] of that color. This is exemplified by the white light emitted by fluorescent lamps, which typically has a spectrum of a few narrow bands, while daylight has a continuous spectrum. The human eye cannot tell the difference between such light spectra just by looking into the light source, although reflected colors from objects can look different. (This is often exploited; for example, to make [[fruit]] or [[tomato]]es look more intensely red.)

Similarly, most human color perceptions can be generated by a mixture of three colors called ''primaries''. This is used to reproduce color scenes in photography, printing, television, and other media. There are a number of methods or [[color space]]s for specifying a color in terms of three particular primary colors. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular application.

No mixture of colors, however, can produce a response truly identical to that of a spectral color, although one can get close, especially for the longer wavelengths, where the [[CIE 1931 color space]] chromaticity diagram has a nearly straight edge. For example, mixing green light (530&amp;nbsp;nm) and blue light (460&amp;nbsp;nm) produces cyan light that is slightly desaturated, because response of the red color receptor would be greater to the green and blue light in the mixture than it would be to a pure cyan light at 485&amp;nbsp;nm that has the same intensity as the mixture of blue and green.

Because of this, and because the ''primaries'' in [[color printing]] systems generally are not pure themselves, the colors reproduced are never perfectly saturated spectral colors, and so spectral colors cannot be matched exactly. However, natural scenes rarely contain fully saturated colors, thus such scenes can usually be approximated well by these systems. The range of colors that can be reproduced with a given color reproduction system is called the [[gamut]]. The [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] chromaticity diagram can be used to describe the gamut.

Another problem with color reproduction systems is connected with the acquisition devices, like cameras or scanners. The characteristics of the color sensors in the devices are often very far from the characteristics of the receptors in the human eye. In effect, acquisition of colors can be relatively poor if they have special, often very "jagged", spectra caused for example by unusual lighting of the photographed scene.
A color reproduction system "tuned" to a human with normal color vision may give very inaccurate results for other observers.

The different color response of different devices can be problematic if not properly managed. For color information stored and transferred in digital form, [[color management]] techniques, such as those based on [[ICC profile]]s, can help to avoid distortions of the reproduced colors. Color management does not circumvent the gamut limitations of particular output devices, but can assist in finding good mapping of input colors into the gamut that can be reproduced.

=== Additive coloring ===

[[File:AdditiveColor.svg|thumb|Additive color mixing: combining red and green yields yellow; combining all three primary colors together yields white.]]

[[Additive color]] is light created by mixing together [[light]] of two or more different colors. [[Red]], [[green]], and [[blue]] are the additive [[primary color]]s normally used in additive color systems such as projectors and computer terminals.

=== Subtractive coloring ===

[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|thumb|Subtractive color mixing: combining yellow and magenta yields red; combining all three primary colors together yields black]]

[[Subtractive color]]ing uses dyes, inks, pigments, or filters to absorb some wavelengths of light and not others. The color that a surface displays comes from the parts of the visible spectrum that are not absorbed and therefore remain visible. Without pigments or dye, fabric fibers, paint base and paper are usually made of particles that scatter white light (all colors) well in all directions. When a pigment or ink is added, wavelengths are absorbed or "subtracted" from white light, so light of another color reaches the eye.

If the light is not a pure white source (the case of nearly all forms of artificial lighting), the resulting spectrum will appear a slightly different color. [[Red]] paint, viewed under [[blue]] light, may appear [[black]]. Red paint is red because it scatters only the red components of the spectrum. If red paint is illuminated by blue light, it will be absorbed by the red paint, creating the appearance of a black object.

=== Structural color ===
{{further|Structural coloration|Animal coloration}}

Structural colors are colors caused by interference effects rather than by pigments. Color effects are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel thin layers, or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the color's [[wavelength]]. If the microstructures are spaced randomly, light of shorter wavelengths will be scattered preferentially to produce [[Tyndall effect]] colors: the blue of the sky (Rayleigh scattering, caused by structures much smaller than the wavelength of light, in this case air molecules), the luster of [[opal]]s, and the blue of human irises. If the microstructures are aligned in arrays, for example the array of pits in a CD, they behave as a [[diffraction grating]]: the grating reflects different wavelengths in different directions due to [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] phenomena, separating mixed "white" light into light of different wavelengths. If the structure is one or more thin layers then it will reflect some wavelengths and transmit others, depending on the layers' thickness.

Structural color is studied in the field of [[thin-film optics]]. The most ordered or the most changeable structural colors are [[iridescence|iridescent]]. Structural color is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the blue jay, for example), as well as certain butterfly wings and beetle shells. Variations in the pattern's spacing often give rise to an iridescent effect, as seen in [[peacock]] feathers, [[soap bubbles]], films of oil, and [[mother of pearl]], because the reflected color depends upon the viewing angle. Numerous scientists have carried out research in butterfly wings and beetle shells, including Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Since 1942, [[Electron microscope|electron micrography]] has been used, advancing the development of products that exploit structural color, such as "[[photonic]]" cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/events/FSS/2006/science.aspx?ComponentId=14867&amp;SourcePageId=14865 |title=Economic and Social Research Council – Science in the Dock, Art in the Stocks |accessdate=2007-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102025015/http://www.esrc.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/events/FSS/2006/science.aspx?ComponentId=14867&amp;SourcePageId=14865 |archivedate=November 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by [[Jim Steyer]] in 2003, Common Sense Media reviews [[book]]s, movies, [[TV show]]s, video games, apps, music, and websites and rates them in terms of age-appropriate educational content, positive messages/role models, violence, [[Human sexual activity|sex]] and [[profanity]], and more for parents making media choices for their kids. Common Sense Media has also developed a set of ratings that are intended to gauge the educational value of videos, games, and apps. The nonprofit's "Learning Ratings" attempt to assess different types of learning qualities within various forms of media.

Donations from foundations and individuals and fees from media partners finance Common Sense Media. Today, the organization distributes its content to more than 100 million [[US]] homes via partnerships with a variety of traditional and [[online media]] companies. Common Sense Media describes itself as "the nation’s largest membership organization dedicated to improving kids’ media lives".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; By 2016, the organization had over 65 million unique users and worked with more than 275,000 educators across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| access-date=August 18, 2016| publisher=Common Sense Media| title=Our Mission| url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission#}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Charlie Rose]] reported that Common Sense Media was the United States largest non-profit dedicated to children's issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://charlierose.com/videos/29631|title=The Steyers|publisher=Charlie Rose|date=December 15, 2016|access-date=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its English language services, Common Sense Media also offers resources in Spanish.

==Early history==
After founding JP Kids, an educational media company for children, and Children Now, a national child advocacy and media group, Jim Steyer founded Common Sense Media in 2003. In an interview with the [[New York Times]], Steyer said he intended to “create a huge constituency for parents and kids in the same way that Mothers Against Drunk Driving or the AARP has done." The group received $500,000 in seed money from a group of donors including Charles Schwab, George Roberts, and James Coulter.&lt;ref name="NYT "/&gt;

To assess parents’ concern about their children’s media habits, Common Sense Media commissioned a poll, which found that “64 percent [of parents with children 2-17] believed that media products in general were inappropriate for their families. It said that 81 percent expressed concern that the media in general were encouraging violent or [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial]] behavior in children.” The polling firm, Penn, Schoen &amp; Berland Associates, said that “only one out of five interviewed ‘fully trusted'’ the separate industry-controlled ratings systems for music, movies, video games and television.”&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Entertainment reviews==
Common Sense Media reviews thousands of movies, TV shows, music, video games, [[Mobile apps|apps]], web sites and books. Based on developmental criteria, the reviews provide guidance regarding each title’s age appropriateness, as well as a “content grid” that rates particular aspects of the title including [[Education|educational value]], [[violence]], sex, gender messages and role models, and more. For each title, Common Sense Media indicates the age for which a title is either appropriate or most relevant. An overall five-star quality rating is also included, as are [[discussion]] questions to help families talk about their entertainment. In addition to Common Sense Media's traditional rating system, they also offer a set of learning based ratings, which are designed to determine complex educational values.&lt;ref name="FC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Our Ratings |publisher=Common Sense Media |accessdate=December 11, 2011 |url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission/about-our-ratings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common Sense Media partners with a number of media companies that distribute the organization’s free content to more than 100 million homes in the United States. According to Common Sense Media’s website, the organization has content distribution contracts with Road Runner, [[TiVo]], Yahoo!, [[Comcast]], Time Warner Cable, [[DIRECTV]], [[Disney]], [[NBC Universal]], [[Netflix]], [[Best Buy]], [[Google]], AOL/Huffington Post, Fandango, Trend Micro, Verizon Foundation, [[Nickelodeon]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], [[Cox Communications]], Kaleidescape, [[AT&amp;T]], and [[National CineMedia|NCM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |publisher=Common Sense Media |accessdate=December 25, 2010 |url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/faq}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization’s current rating system differs from the system used by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and the Entertainment Software Rating Board. It has received positive support from parents, and was singled out by US President [[Barack Obama]] as a model for using technology to empower parents.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Judith |title=Common Sense Raises Issues at B&amp;N  |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=February 13, 2010 |accessdate=December 25, 2010 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/42190-common-sense-raises-issues-at-b-amp-n.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/our-mission/about-our-ratings|title=About Ratings|publisher=Common Sense Media|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common Sense Media began allowing studios to use their ratings and endorsements in order to promote family-friendly movies in 2014. The first film to use the endorsement was Disney’s ''[[Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (film)|Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day]]''.&lt;ref name=endorse&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/business/media/movie-watchdog-group-gives-out-its-first-seal-of-approval-.html?_r=1 |title=Movie Watchdog Group Gives Out Its First Seal of Approval |last1=Cieply |first1=Michael |date=5 October 2014 |website=NYTimes.com |publisher=The New York Times Company |access-date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Common Sense Media has played a role in influencing billions of dollars in government spending on education-related technologies including classroom broadband access and various learning apps. In April 2015, they launched the national advocacy effort, Common Sense Kids Action, to push for certain state and federal efforts to bolster education for children.&lt;ref name=commonsensekidsaction&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/technology/turning-a-childrens-rating-system-into-an-advocacy-army.html?_r=2 |title=Turning a Children’s Rating System Into an Advocacy Army |last1=Singer |first1=Natasha |date=26 April 2015 |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times Company |access-date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, the Common Sense Education program had grown to include over 300,000 member teachers in approximately 100,000 schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| access-date=August 18, 2016| publisher=Common Sense Media| date=June 28, 2016| title=Digital Compass, Common Sense Education’s Digital Citizenship Student Interactive for 6th-8th Graders, Named 2016 Best Website for Teaching &amp; Learning by AASL| url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/news/press-releases/digital-compass-common-sense-educations-digital-citizenship-student}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, CSM partnered with [[Harvard University]] and the organization Global Kids to organize a three-way communication with parents, teenagers, and educators about issues faced in the online world.&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt;

Common Sense has 2 free education programs for schools and other organizations to use with students and parents. The goal of these resources is to help young people learn how to think critically, behave safely, and participate responsibly in today's ever-changing digital media world. More than 75,000 schools and over 158,000 educators around the [[world]] are using these resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ednetinsight.com/news-alerts/technology-headlines/digital-literacy-curriculum-available-as-free-ibooks-textbooks.html | title = Digital Literacy Curriculum Available as Free iBooks Textbooks | publisher= EdNet Insight|date=1 March 2014 | accessdate = 15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first product is a Parent Media and Technology Education Program that was launched in late 2008. The program includes a comprehensive library of resources, like tip sheets, workshop slides and script, videos, and discussion guides that educators can use to engage and educate parents about technology issues ranging from media violence and commercialism to cyberbullying and cellphone etiquette.

The second product, launched in 2009, is a K-12 Digital Literacy and Citizenship Curriculum consisting of more than 60 lesson plans, student handouts, videos and interactive components that span three topic areas: Safety and Security, Digital Citizenship, and Research and Information Literacy.  The [[curriculum]] was informed by research done by Howard Gardner's GoodPlay Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

The resources were developed with support from many foundations, including the Sherwood, [[MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur]], and Hewlett Foundations, which enables Common Sense to offer these products to educators for free.

CSM has also teamed with [[MTV]]'s "A Thin Line" campaign, the Family Violence Prevention Fund, and Yahoo! Safely to conduct a series of town hall meetings for teenagers and parents to discuss online issues that they face; the first was held in Omaha, Nebraska on December 6, 2010, the second took place in Chicago on October 25, 2011.&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt; The third town hall meeting will be moderated by MTV News anchor [[Sway Calloway]] and is scheduled to take place on October 2 in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Digital passport===
In 2012, CSM released its "Digital Passport," an online curriculum designed to teach children how to safely and responsibly navigate the Internet. The courses can be accessed for free by classroom teachers, who are then able to monitor their students' progress. Digital passport lessons are presented as games that reward progress with badges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Graphite===
In 2013 CSM launched Graphite, an online resource for teachers that allows them to review and rate educational technology. The project is supported by Chicago philanthropist [[Susan Crown]] and [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Bill Gates]]' [[bgC3]].&lt;ref name=graphite&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/08/26/graphite-teachers/2699705/  |title= Yelp for teachers: new site Graphite launches |last1=Toppo |first1=Greg |date=26 August 2013 |website=usatoday.com |publisher=Gannett Company, Inc |access-date=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy issues==

===Online privacy===
Common Sense Media supported the U.S. Department of Commerce's creation of an "online privacy policy", which would include a "Privacy Bill of Rights" and would make clear which types of personal information companies are allowed to keep on clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Albanesius |first=Chloe |title=Commerce Dept. Unveils Online Privacy Plan |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |date=December 16, 2010 |accessdate=December 25, 2010 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2374433,00.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also called for updates  to the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA) rules to ensure that they keep pace with changes in [[technology]] since the law was passed in 1998 – as documented by Common Sense Media in a report to the Federal Trade Commission as part of a review of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Common Sense Comments on Children's Online Privacy Protection |publisher=Common Sense Media |year=2010 |accessdate=December 25, 2010 |url=http://cdn1.www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/Common_Sense_Comments_on_Children_and_Privacy_Protection.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also helped [[Massachusetts]] Representative [[Edward Markey]] and Texas Representative [[Joe Barton]] draft legislation that required websites aimed at children under 13 to obtain parental permission before collecting personal information. According to the [[Wall Street Journal]], the group also wanted websites to feature an "eraser button" that would allow children and teens to delete information that they’ve posted online about themselves. The group also favored a ban on "behavioral marketing" to kids—ads targeted at children based on their online activities.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703865004575649140574658582|title=Proposed Law Would Prohibit Web Collection of Data on Kids|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=December 23, 2006|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, CSM pushed for the passing of California’s “Eraser Bill.” As of June 2006, social media websites must allow California children under age 18 to remove their own postings.&lt;ref name=eraser&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/24/net-us-usa-california-internet-idUSBRE98N15M20130924 |title= California law allows kids to erase digital indiscretions |last1=Cohen |first1=Ronnie |date=24 September 2013 |website=reuters.com |publisher=Thomson-Reuters Corporation |access-date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, they advocated the passing of California Senate Bill 1177, which prohibits the sale and disclosure of schools' online student data. The bill also forbids targeted ads based on school information and the creation of student profiles when not used for education purposes.&lt;ref name=mercury&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mercurynews.com/News/ci_26444107/California-Legislature-passes-stiffest-US-bill-to-protect-K12-students-online-data  |title= California Legislature passes stiffest U.S. bill to protect K-12 students' online data |last1=Noguchi |first1=Sharon |date=31 August 2014 |website=mercurynews.com |publisher=San Jose Mercury News |access-date=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violent video games===
Common Sense Media played a major role in the passage of the 2005 California law criminalizing the sale of violent [[video games]] to minors. The organization submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court regarding the case ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'' (formerly ''Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Association'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwarzenegger |first=Arnold |authorlink=Arnold Schwarzenegger |date=July 19, 2010 |title=Brief of ''amicus curiae'' – Common Sense Media in Support Of Petitioners |url=http://www.mediacoalition.org/mediaimages/Schwarzenegger_Common%20Sense%20Media%20Amicus_07.19.10.pdf |accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They published a survey, conducted by Zogby International, which asked 2100 parents whether or not they supported the "video game ban bill" – CA Law AB 1793; results showed that 72% of the respondents expressed support for the bill, and another 75% held negative views of the video game industry when it comes to how they protect kids from violent video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McElroy |first=Griffin |title=Common Sense Media: 72 percent of parents support proposed Calif. violent game law |publisher=Joystiq |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=December 25, 2010 |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/13/common-sense-media-72-percent-of-parents-support-proposed-calif/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2006, Common Sense Media protested to the [[Federal Trade Commission]] about the ESRB's rating downgrade of a revised version of ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' from "Adults Only" to "Mature". It protested on the basis that the revised version of the game, which was censored to prevent the game from remaining banned in both countries, was still banned in the UK via the ratings given by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC). They also noted that players could still play a "leaked uncensored version" of ''Manhunt 2'' on modded [[PlayStation 2]], as Take-Two Interactive mentioned. The organization asked the FTC to launch a federal investigation into the ESRB rating process, citing the wide availability of the leaked version and the damage to children that the censored version still had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Steyer |first=James P. |title=Letter from Common Sense Media to Donald S. Clerk, Secretary, Federal Trade Commission |publisher=Common Sense Media |date=November 1, 2007 |accessdate=December 25, 2010 |url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/071101csmedia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questioning whether CSM media had begun functioning as a lobbying group rather than advocacy group the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Common Sense Media "one of the most zealous voices when it comes to encouraging state legislation limiting the sale of ultra-violent games to minors and was "splitting hairs" regarding the difference between lobbying and advocacy in its efforts.&lt;ref name="Pham"/&gt;

===Media and child health===
Common Sense Media participated in the FCC's Child Obesity Taskforce in April 2006 and hosted ''Beyond Primetime'', a panel discussion and conference on issues related to kids and media, featuring lead executives from the nation’s top media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/news/press-releases/common-sense-commends-food-and-beverage-industry-positive-step-toward-r |title=Common Sense Commends Food and Beverage Industry for Positive Step Toward Responsible Marketing |publisher=Common Sense Media |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, Common Sense Media and The Department of Clinical Bioethics at the [[National Institutes of Health]] released a [[white paper]], which outlines the ways that media exposure can impact children's health. The paper evaluated 173 media-related studies from the past 28 years and concluded that "In 80% of the studies, greater media exposure is associated with negative health outcomes for children and adolescents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In October 2006, Common Sense Media released a white paper compiled from existing research on body image perceptions in kids and teens. The paper states more than half of boys as young as 6 to 8 think their ideal weight is thinner than their current size and that children with parents who are dissatisfied with their bodies are more likely to feel that way about their own.&lt;ref name=bodyweight&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/13/living/feat-body-image-kids-younger-ages/index.html |title=Kids as young as 5 concerned about body image |last1=Wallace |first1=Kelly |date=13 February 2015 |website=CNN.com |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc |access-date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Common Sense Media released a study which it developed in collaboration with the [[University of Southern California]]’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism focused on families in both Japan and America and technology use. Surveys of families in the United States were compared to surveys of Japanese families and found that both countries struggle with the impact of technology on family life and relationships.

Common Sense Media released a PSA with [[Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners]] in 2017 called Device Free Dinner which featured [[Will Ferrell]] as a distracted dad at the dinner table, in order to raise awareness for responsible technology and media usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40482848/will-ferrell-is-your-distracted-dad-in-these-tech-responsibility-psas |title=Will Ferrell Is Your Distracted Dad In These Tech Responsibility PSAs |date=October 19, 2017 |website=Fast Company |publisher= |access-date=June 13, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Zero to Eight: Children's Media Use in America"===
In October 2006, Common Sense Media published a study titled "Zero to Eight: Children's Media Use in America", which was conducted to "understand the patterns of media use among young American children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/zero-eight-childrens-media-use-america |title=Zero to Eight: Children's Media Use in America |author= |date=October 25, 2011 |work= |publisher=Common Sense Media |accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data for the study was derived from surveys taken by 1,384 parents of children ages zero to eight between April to August 2006.&lt;ref name="DT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytech.com/Study+Over+50+of+Children+Under+8+Use+Mobile+Devices+for+Media+Consumption/article23136.htm |title=Study: Over 50% of Children Under 8 Use Mobile Devices for Media Consumption |author=Tiffany Kaiser |date=October 28, 2006 |work= |publisher=DailyTech |accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study reported that over 50% of children under eight years of age have had regular access to a mobile device and that children under two "spend twice as much time watching TV and videos (53 minutes) as they do reading books (23 minutes)."&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/52-percent-kids-under-age-8-have-access-mobile-media-119492 |title=52 percent of kids under age 8 have access to mobile media |author=Suzanne Choney |date= |work= |publisher=MSNBC News |accessdate=September 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eschoolnews.com/2011/10/25/study-more-than-half-of-young-children-use-digital-media/ |title=More than half of young children use digital media |author= |date=October 25, 2006 |work= |publisher=eSchoolNews |accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also highlighted the influence of the [[digital divide]] on young children.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt;

In October 2013, Common Sense Media published its new study, "Zero to Eight: Children’s Media Use in America, 2013". The 2013 data was based on a survey of 1,463 parents. The study reported that 38% of children under two had used a mobile device. The report also stated that seven out of ten children under age eight have used mobile devices.&lt;ref name = nytimes&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/us/new-milestone-emerges-babys-first-iphone-app.html?_r=2&amp; | title = New Milestone Emerges: Baby’s First iPhone App | author = Tamar Lewin | date = 28 October 2013 | accessdate = 15 August 2014 | publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/survey-for-young-children-mobile-devices-such-as-tablets-smartphones-now-a-mainstay/2013/10/27/7e386f3c-3f1f-11e3-a624-41d661b0bb78_story.html | title = Survey: For young children, mobile devices such as tablets, smartphones now a mainstay | author = Cecilia Kang | date = 28 October 2013 | accessdate = 15 August 2014 | publisher = ''[[Washington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Watching Gender: How Stereotypes in Movies and on TV Impact Kids' Development"===
In June 2017, Common Sense Media released the report “Watching Gender: How Stereotypes in Movies and on TV Impact Kids’ Development” based on a survey of approximately 1,000 parents across the United States about how media affected their children and the evaluation of 150 articles from academic journals. The findings focused on gender roles and their portrayal in media, which can shape career choices and self-image in children. As a result, Common Sense Media developed a testing system to rate movies and television shows based on their usage and portrayal of traditional gender stereotypes. The company agreed to lease its ratings to cable companies to raise awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refinery29.com/2017/06/160422/common-sense-media-watching-gender-report |title=Yes, Kids Pick Up On Gender Stereotypes – Here’s Proof |date=July 22, 2017 |publisher=Refinery 29 |access-date=June 18, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/arts/common-sense-media-ratings-gender.html |title=A New Rating for TV and Movies Tries to Combat Gender Stereotypes |date=June 20, 2017 |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=December 8, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Laramie Project'' (2002)===
{{main article|The Laramie Project (film)}}
''The Laramie Project'' is a 2002 drama film written and directed by [[Moisés Kaufman]], and based on his own [[#The Laramie Project|play of the same name]] mentioned below. The film featured an all-star cast. It [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the 2002 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and was first broadcast on [[HBO]] on March 9, 2002. The film was praised by ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s Matt Roush for its emotional range, its examination of homophobia, and the unique investigation at its center, saying that viewers would be "enlightened" by it.&lt;ref name=Roush&gt;Matt Roush. "The Lost Boy: Revisiting the Shepard Tragedy" ''[[TV Guide]]''; March 9, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

===''The Matthew Shepard Story'' (2002)===
{{Main article|The Matthew Shepard Story}}
''The Matthew Shepard Story'' is a [[television film]] about the trial of the killers of Matthew Shepard. It premiered on [[NBC]] on March 9, 2002, the same night as HBO's ''The Laramie Project''. It starred [[Shane Meier]] as Matthew Shepard, and depicting his parents were [[Sam Waterston]] as [[Dennis Shepard]] and [[Stockard Channing]] as [[Judy Shepard]]. The film won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in 2002 in the category of ''Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie'' for [[Stockard Channing]]'s performance as Judy Shepard. The film's cast also includes [[Kristen Thomson]], [[Joseph Ziegler]], [[Makyla Smith]], [[Damien Atkins]], and [[Wendy Crewson]]. The ending featured [[Elton John]]'s song about Shepard, "[[American Triangle]]", from his album ''[[Songs from the West Coast]]''.

The film seeks to illuminate the decisions Judy and Dennis Shepard had to make as to whether the [[capital punishment|death penalty]] should be sought for their son's killer. Throughout the movie there are several flashbacks of Matthew's life. It also shows the experiences and hardships Matthew endured throughout his life from junior high through college, including his first kiss, his first boyfriend and a rape scene.

Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' criticized the film as unoriginal, and NBC for scheduling it on the same night as HBO's ''The Laramie Project'', which Roush felt was the far superior effort. Roush opined that although ''The Matthew Shepard Story'' had some merit, and that some might even be moved by it, its decision to open with a depiction of Shepard's murder was "grotesque", and that overall, it did not possess the depth of ''Project''.&lt;ref name=Roush/&gt;

Almost a decade later, [[Tectonic Theater Project]] created a second play, titled ''The Laramie Project: 10 Years Later'', based on interviews with members of the town, Shepard's mother, and his incarcerated murderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thefastertimes.com/theatertalk/2009/10/04/333/ |title=Remembering a Cruel Murder: Laramie Revisited |publisher=Thefastertimes.com |date=2009-10-04 |accessdate=2010-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210233413/http://thefastertimes.com/theatertalk/2009/10/04/333/ |archive-date=2009-12-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/131670-Laramie-Project-Ten-Years-Later-to-Be-Read-Across-US|work=Playbill|date=August 4, 2009|title=Laramie Project: Ten Years Later to Be Read Across U.S.|author=Jones, Kenneth|access-date=2014-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927072320/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/131670-Laramie-Project-Ten-Years-Later-to-Be-Read-Across-US|archive-date=2013-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
In the ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' episode "A Private Life", on HBO, a gay man is brutally murdered in a way that mirrors Matthew Shepard's death.

Shepard's manner of death is mentioned in ''[[United States of Tara]]'', when Marshall is cautioned about his relationship with another character.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Matthew Shepard incident and the subsequent introduction of the [[Matthew Shepard Act]] inspired a story arc which spanned several episodes in the first season of ''[[The West Wing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0745682/trivia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Declaration of Independence''''' is a {{convert|12|by|18|ft|adj=on}} [[Oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting by American [[John Trumbull]] depicting the presentation of the [[wikt:draft|draft]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] to [[Second Continental Congress|Congress]]. It was based on a much smaller version of the same scene, presently held by the [[Yale University Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name=yale69/&gt; 
Trumbull painted many of the figures in the picture from life, and visited [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] to depict the chamber where the [[Second Continental Congress]] met. The oil-on-canvas work was commissioned in 1817, purchased in 1819, and placed in the [[United States Capitol rotunda]] in 1826.

The painting is sometimes incorrectly described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The painting shows the [[Committee of Five|five-man drafting committee]] presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.&lt;ref&gt;John Hazelton, "The Historical Value of Trumbull's - 'Declaration of Independence' ", [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA30&amp;id=tv47AAAAIAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' - Volume 31], (Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1907), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows 42 of the 56 signers of the Declaration; Trumbull originally intended to include all 56 signers but was unable to obtain likenesses for all of them. He also depicted several participants in the debate who did not sign the document, including [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], who declined to sign. Trumbull had no portrait of Benjamin Harrison V to work with, but his son Benjamin Harrison VI was said to resemble his father, so Trumbull painted him instead. As the Declaration was debated and signed over a period of time when membership in Congress changed, the men featured in the painting never were in the same room at the same time.

In the painting, [[Thomas Jefferson]] appears to be stepping on [[John Adams]]' foot in the painting, which many thought was supposed to symbolize their relationship as political enemies. However, upon closer examination of the painting, it can be seen that their feet are merely close together. This part of the image was correctly depicted on the [[United States two-dollar bill|two-dollar bill]] version.

The following key to the figures in the painting follows the numbering used by the U.S. government publication "Art of the Capitol" (in the illustration of the key shown in this section) but provides a different (hopefully clearer) description of which figure is where in the painting, so numbers are not entirely in order.

Trumbull's painting is presently depicted on the reverse of the [[United States two-dollar bill|two-dollar bill]]. Featured in it are 40 of the 47 figures from Trumbull's painting.  Cut out from the scene are: the farthest four figures on the left—George Wythe, William Whipple, Josiah Bartlett, and Thomas Lynch, Jr.; the farthest two figures on the right—Thomas McKean and Philip Livingston; and one of three figures seated in the left rear—George Walton. Additionally, two unrecognized figures were added: one in between Samuel Chase and Lewis Morris and another between James Wilson and Francis Hopkinson, bringing the total number of figures shown in this presentation scene to 42.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6005">The '''Domhnach Airgid''' (English: '''Sliver Church''') is an 8th-century Irish metalwork and wooden book [[shrine]] of the [[cumdach]] type, held at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.culturalheritageireland.ie/index.php/component/content/article/67-metalwork/188-the-domhnach-airgid- The Domhnach Airgid]". Cultural Heritage Ireland. Retrieved 1 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; since 1847.&lt;ref name="dd464" /&gt; It is traditionally associated with [[Saint Patrick]], who was thought to have had it in his possession at one point.

Domhnach Airgid comprises two separate main elements: an outer casket or box and the fragments of a 6th-9th century manuscript it was built to hold. The wooden oblong box is heavily inscribed, with lettering running right around the outer borders, and it is covered by silver and bronze panels which contain fragments of [[vellum]] manuscript of the [[Gospels]] written in Latin.&lt;ref name="Cornhill"&gt;"The Study of Celtic Literature". ''The Cornhill magazine'', Volume 11; Volume 13. Guildford: Cornhill 1993. p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-nine pages of the manuscript survive,&lt;ref name="dd464"&gt;Diringer (1986), 464&lt;/ref&gt; each about nine inches in height.&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt;

The shrine was redesigned c 1350, when the much of the extant metalwork and [[relief]] plaques on the cover were added. The work is thus a mixture of the non-contemporary [[Insular art]] and [[International Gothic]] styles.

==Design==

Domhnach Airgid's casket was designed to hold relics and consists of three covers, with the center one being made of wood, probably from [[yew]]. Another is made from copper, plated with silver. The outer cover, pictured above, is of the highest quality, and lined with silver and decorated by [[gilding]].&lt;ref name="oc322"&gt;O'Curry (1878), 322&lt;/ref&gt; The cover contains a series of elevated carving centered on a representation of Jesus on [[Crucifix|the cross]] surrounded by eleven smaller sized figures, including a grouping of three [[apostles]], probably James, Peter and Paul, the panel showing the [[Archangel Michael]] and the Virgin and Child, a panel with a grouping of [[Saint Colmcille]], [[St. Brigid]] and Patrick, while with the saint at the lower right is thought to represent of Patrick presenting a cumdach to [[Mac Cairthinn of Clogher|St. Macartan]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://irisharchaeology.ie/2015/02/the-domhnach-airgid-an-early-irish-book-shrine/ The Domhnach Airgid, an Early Irish Book Shrine]". Irish Archaeology, 2015. Retrieved 1 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The corners of the frontispiece contain a series of running animals or [[grotesques]] placed on small mounts. A dove, representing the [[Holy Spirit]] and decorated with a crystal, hovers above Christ's head.&lt;ref name="oc323"&gt;O'Curry (1878), 323&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures are ornately and delicately carved. The cover was built to hold a number of [[relic]]s, by legend associated with Patrick. In this tradition, the shrine was thought to have been in his possession and was sanctified by him&lt;ref name="oc12"&gt;O'Curry (1861), 12&lt;/ref&gt; before he gave it to St. Macartan. It thus became a significant and prized object that was widely venerated.&lt;ref name="ot98"&gt;O'Toole (2013), 98&lt;/ref&gt;


The case was significantly remodeled around 1350 (a dating established by [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]]) by the goldsmith John O’Bardan, during work commissioned by John O’Carbri, [[Clones Abbey|abbot of Clones]]. O’Bardan, whose signature appears on the object and is known to have lived in [[Drogheda]], modernised the appearance of the shrine in the contemporary International Gothic style,&lt;ref name="ot98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="h510"&gt;Hourihane (2012), 510&lt;/ref&gt; and added the figures of Jesus and the saints.&lt;ref name="ot98" /&gt; O’Carbri likely had political motivations for commissioning the redesign in the context of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland]]. The Normans sought to undermine the established order, in part by undermining and reforming Irish Christianity, while seeking to detach it from its Celtic basis. In response, some clerics fought back by refurbishing and restoring early medieval sacred objects in order to reinforce the island's cultural identity.&lt;ref name="ot98"  /&gt;

Due to its age, the Domhnach Airgid is not in good condition. Areas of the gilding contain accumulations of dirt, and any colourisation has long since faded, giving it its current dark appearance of mostly brown and black hues.&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt;

==Manuscript==
The manuscript is of the Cathach (literally "Battle Book") style,&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt; indicating an apocryphal use as a rallying cry or protector in battle. There are 39 surviving leaves, with text written in the [[Insular script|Irish majuscule]] script.&lt;ref name="dd464" /&gt; The manuscript leaves are very worn down, and some have become detached from their casing.&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2525">'''Free play''' ({{lang-fr|jeu libre}}) is a literary concept from [[Jacques Derrida]]'s 1966 essay, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences." In his essay, Derrida speaks of a philosophical "[[Event (philosophy)|event]]" that has occurred to the historic foundation of structure. Before the “event,” man was the center of all things. After the “event,” however, man could no longer be judged the center of the universe. Without this centralized reference, all that is left is “free play.”

&lt;blockquote&gt;[U]p until the event which I wish to mark out and define, structure—or rather the structurality of structure—although it has always been involved, has always been neutralized or reduced, and this by a process of giving it a center or referring it to a point of presence, a fixed origin. The function of this center was not only to orient, balance, and organize the structure—one cannot in fact conceive of an unorganized structure—but above all to make sure that the organizing principle of the structure would limit what we might call the freeplay of the structure. No doubt that by orienting and organizing the coherence of the system, the center of a structure permits the freeplay of its elements inside the total form. And even today the notion of a structure lacking any center represents the unthinkable itself.&lt;br&gt;— "Structure, Sign and Play" in ''Writing and Difference'', p. 278&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Besides the tension of freeplay with history, there is also the tension of freeplay with presence. Freeplay is the disruption of presence. The presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a chain. Freeplay is always an interplay of absence and presence, but if it is to be radically conceived, freeplay must be conceived of before the alternative of presence and absence; being must be conceived of as presence or absence beginning with the possibility of freeplay and not the other way around.&lt;br&gt;—"Structure, Sign and Play" in ''Writing and Difference'', p. 294&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''George Widener''' (born {{#dateformat:February 8, 1962}} in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] [https://www.artsy.net/artist/george-widener])&lt;ref&gt;Darold A. Treffert, ''Islands of Genius: The Bountiful Mind of the Autistic, Acquired, and Sudden Savant'' (Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 2010) p179&lt;/ref&gt; is a self-taught artist who employs his extraordinary mathematical/calculating capability to create art ranging from complex calendars and numerical [[palindrome]]s to [[Rembrandt]]-like antiquarian landscapes to Asian scrolls.
==Collections==
His work can be found in many private and public [[Outsider Art]] collections, including the Bruno Decharme ABCD Collection in Paris, The [[American Folk Art Museum]], The Art Collection of the [[MIND Institute|UC Davis M.I.N.D. Institute]], and The Collection de l’Art Brut. Widener has exhibited at the [http://www.jankrugierny.com Jan Krugier Gallery], [http://www.salondudessincontemporain.com Salon du Dessins Contemporain], [http://www.kunsthaus-kannen.de Kunsthaus Kannen] (Münster), the Islands of Genius exhibition (for prodigious savants) and others, and shows at the New York Outsider Art Fair, when ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' art critic [[Roberta Smith]] proclaimed that the artist was “one of the Outsider Art Fair’s most significant recent discoveries”.&lt;ref&gt;Continuing the Robert Smith article from [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EFD8173BF93BA15752C0A9639C8B63 “Untamed Art From the Fringes Is a Gust of Bracing Air"], ''The New York Times'', January 28, 2005,
: "And at Henry Boxer, on a par with the work of Dû-Glass, by which I mean high, are the drawings of George Widener, a British mathematical savant in his 40's, who covers surfaces made of tea-stained paper napkins with profusions of numbers and words. The most magnificent of these reviews the sinking of the Titanic in considerable detail."&lt;/ref&gt; George is also the subject of a recently published (2009) book ''The Art of George Widener'' by Roger Cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;It was Cardinal who, in 1972, coined the term "Outsider Art" as an English translation of the French term "Art Brut" (meaning "raw" or "rough" art).&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at an October 2008 hallmark event organized under the auspices of the Royal Society and the British Academy on the subjects of autism and creativity, Cardinal illustrated and detailed the 'truly visionary alternative worlds of George Widener".&lt;ref&gt;See The Psychologist News, [http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/blog/blogpost.cfm?catid=48&amp;threadid=477 Talent and Autism]&lt;/ref&gt;

George Widener lives in the mountain town of [[Waynesville, North Carolina]] and travels abroad frequently. He is represented in London by the [[Henry Boxer Gallery]] and in New York City by the [[Ricco/Maresca Gallery]].

'''''God Speed''''' is a painting by British artist [[Edmund Leighton]], depicting an armored knight departing to war and leaving his beloved. The painting was exhibited in the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2012/british-irish-art/lot.26.html| title =Lot 26 |publisher =[[Sotheby's]]| accessdate = 28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''God Speed'' was the first of several paintings by Leighton in the 1900s on the subject of [[chivalry]], the others being ''[[The Accolade (painting)|The Accolade]]'' (1901) and ''The Dedication'' (1908).

==Composition==
The woman ties a red sash around the knight's arm, which he is meant to return, a medieval custom which assured both parties that they would be reunited, alive and well.&lt;ref name="tet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/arts-entertainment/reading-art-blair-leightons-god-speed-279518.html |title=Reading Art: Blair Leighton’s ‘God Speed’ |publisher=[[The Epoch Times]] |author=Wim Van Aalst |date=August 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808044844/http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/arts-entertainment/reading-art-blair-leightons-god-speed-279518.html |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[griffin]] on the [[Newel|newel post]] of the stairs is a symbol of strength and military courage.&lt;ref name="tet"/&gt; The knight departs through a castle gate with [[portcullis]]; others can be seen leaving through the gate.

When the painting was ready for transportation to the Royal Academy, Leighton made a last-moment change in the studio.&lt;ref name="artmag"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.artmagick.com/articles/article.aspx?id=11813|title=The Art of Mr. E.

==Provenance==
After being bought from Leighton, the painting was owned by several people and in 1988 appeared at [[Christie's]].&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"/&gt; It was then housed in an American private collection and in 2000 was again submitted to Christie's.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"/&gt; In 2007 the painting appeared at [[Sotheby's]] and then in a British private collection.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"/&gt; On 10 May 2012 ''God Speed'' was sold again to a private collector through Sotheby's in London.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"/&gt;

The '''''Gonfalon of Justice''''' (Italian - ''Gonfalone della Giustizia'') is a tempera and oil on canvas painting by [[Perugino]], dating to around 1501 and now housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]] in Perugia.

It was commissioned as a [[gonfalon]] (banner for public processions) by the brothers of the Confraternity of Justice in Perugia. It dates to the artist's peak, just after the success of his cycle of paintings for the Sala delle Udienze del Collegio del Cambio, when he was working in both Florence and Perugia. It shows the Madonna and Child accompanied by angels and [[seraphim]], with [[Francis of Assisi]] (with the stigmata) and [[Bernardino of Siena]] kneeling below them. 

Between the two male saints is the [[Christogram#IHS|Christogram]] 'IHS' in the foreground and a view of Perugia in the background, with its female citizens kneeling to the right, the male citizens to the left and other kneeling figures in the white habits of the Confraternity. The composition draws on the painter's assemblage of drawings, with the Madonna and Child similar to those in his 1497 ''[[Fano Altarpiece]]'', the two symmetrical gilded angels to those in the ''[[San Francesco al Prato Resurrection]]'', ''[[Madonna in Glory with Saints]]'' and ''[[Madonna della Consolazione (Perugino)|Madonna della Consolazione]]'', all dating to around 1501 like the Gonfalon.

{{Expand German|Ida Jenbach|date=March 2010}}
Hungarian born '''Ida Jenbach''' was a [[playwright]] and [[screenwriter]] for German and Austrian [[film|cinema]] during the 1920s. She was one of the authors of the spirited farce ''Opera Ball'' that appeared at the [[Little Carnegie Playhouse]] in [[New York City]] in 1931. ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Mordaunt Hall]] praised this comedy as “cleverly acted by the principals.”  ''[[The Opera Ball (1931 film)|The Opera Ball]]'' (''Opernredoute'') was a German film that had “captions in English lettered on the scenes to keep those unfamiliar with German au courant of what is happening.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Between Two Worlds: The Jewish Presence in German and Austrian Film, 1910-1933|author=Siegbert Salomon Prawer|publisher=Berghahn Books|year= 2005|isbn=1-84545-074-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Jenbach wrote the script to ''[[The Priest from Kirchfeld (1926 film)|The Priest from Kirchfeld]]'', based on [[Ludwig Anzengruber]]‘s popular German "folk play". The play bears a notable resemblance to ''The Atonement of Gosta Berling.'' Attacking the [[Catholic]] doctrine of [[celibacy]] for priests and the denial of burial for [[suicide]]s, the play was and remains very controversial.

Jenbach also worked on the screenplay to [[Hugo Bettauer]]’s 1924 [[dystopia]]n [[satire]], ''[[Die Stadt ohne Juden]]'' ("The City without Jews").  This novel was prescient. It imagined a city that expelled the Jews and confiscated their wealth. It was meant to show the ridiculousness of [[anti-Semitism]]. It was Bettauer’s most famous and best selling novel, and was translated into numerous languages. It was also his undoing. The novel angered the [[Nazi]]s. A year later, Nazi party member [[Otto Rothstock]] murdered Bettauer. When the film version opened, members of the National Socialist party tossed [[stink bomb]]s into the cinemas, and cinema owners often cut parts of the film out. This film was the first important role for German film star [[Hans Moser (actor)|Hans Moser]]. In 1933, some in the German press said that this film speaks for itself as an indictment against [[Hitler]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.

During the [[Third Reich]], Jenbach was sent to the [[Ghetto at Minsk]]. She died either there or in a concentration camp nearby. Her date of death is unknown.

'''John Maler Collier''' &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters|RP]] [[Royal Institute of Oil Painters|ROI]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|l|i|ər}}; 27 January 1850 &amp;ndash; 11 April 1934) was a leading English artist, and an author.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Janet 2002. ''Charles Darwin: the power of place''. Cape, London p487&amp;ndash;488&lt;/ref&gt; He painted in the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] style, and was one of the most prominent [[portrait painter]]s of his generation. Both his marriages were to daughters of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. He studied painting at the [[Munich Academy]] starting in 1875.

== Family ==
{{See also|Huxley family}}

Collier was from a talented and successful family. His grandfather, John Collier, was a Quaker merchant who became a Member of Parliament. His [[Robert Porrett Collier, 1st Baron Monkswell|father, Robert]], (who was a Member of Parliament, [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] and, for many years, a full-time [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|judge of the Privy Council]]) was created the first [[Baron Monkswell|Lord Monkswell]]. He was also a member of the [[Royal Society of British Artists]]. John Collier's elder brother, the second Lord Monkswell, was [[Under-Secretary of State for War]] and Chairman of the [[London County Council]].

[[Image:Marion Collier (née Huxley) by John Collier.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Collier's first wife, Marian Huxley, 1883]]

In due course, Collier became an integral part of the family of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] [[Privy councillor|PC]], President of the [[Royal Society]] from 1883 to 1885. Collier married two of Huxley's daughters and was "on terms of intimate friendship" with his son, the writer [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]]. Collier's first wife, in 1879, was Marian (Mady) Huxley. She was a painter who studied, like her husband, at the [[Slade School of Fine Art|Slade]] and exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] and elsewhere. After the birth of their only child, a daughter, she suffered severe [[post-partum depression|post-natal depression]] and was taken to Paris for treatment where, however, she contracted [[pneumonia]] and died in 1887.  Collier's daughter by his first marriage, Joyce, was a portrait miniaturist, and a member of the Royal Society of Miniature Painters. 

In 1889 Collier married Mady's younger sister Ethel Huxley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Collier, Hon. John|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=362|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907]] such a marriage was not possible in England, so the ceremony took place in Norway. By his second wife he had a daughter and a son, Sir [[Laurence Collier]], who was the British Ambassador to Norway 1941&amp;ndash;51.

==Subjects==
Collier's range of portrait subjects was broad. In 1893, for example, his subjects included [[Lovelace Stamer]], [[Anglican Bishop of Shrewsbury|Bishop of Shrewsbury]]; Sir [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] FRS; A N Hornby (Captain of the Lancashire Eleven); [[Edward Augustus Inglefield]] (Admiral and Arctic explorer).
  
[[Image:Lady Godiva (John Collier, c. 1897).jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''[[Lady Godiva (painting)|Lady Godiva]]'', 1898, [[Herbert Art Gallery &amp; Museum]]]]

His commissioned portrait of the [[Duke of York]] (later [[George V]]) as Master of [[Trinity House]] in 1901, and the [[Prince of Wales]] (later [[Edward VIII]]) were his major royal portraits. The latter work was hung in [[Durbar Hall]], [[Jodhpur]], [[Rajputana]].

Other subjects included two [[Lord Chancellor]]s (the [[Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne|Earl of Selborne]] in 1882 and the [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury|Earl of Halsbury]]) in 1897; The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], [[William Gully, 1st Viscount Selby|William Gully]], (1897); senior legal figures the [[Lord Chief Justice]] [[Richard Everard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Lord Alverstone]] (1912) and the [[Master of the Rolls]] Sir [[George Jessel (jurist)|George Jessel]] (1881).&lt;ref&gt;Here and elsewhere, the source is Collier's notebook, in the archives of the National Portrait Gallery, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Collier-Angela McInnes.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Angela Thirkell|Angela McInnes]]'' by Collier, 1914]]

[[Rudyard Kipling]] (1891); the painter Sir [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] (1884); the actors [[John Lawrence Toole|J.L. Toole]] (1887) and [[Madge Kendal]], [[Ellen Terry]] and [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] (in ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'') (1904); heads of educational institutions such as the Master of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] [[Edward Caird]] (1904), the Warden of [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham]] G.E. Thorley (1889) and the Provost of [[Eton College|Eton]] (1897). Soldiers such as Field Marshal [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener of Khartoum]] (1911) and Field Marshal Sir Frederick Haines (1891); two Indian [[maharajah]]s, including the [[Maharajah]] of [[Nepal]] (1910); and scientists including [[Charles Darwin]] (1882), the artist's father-in-law [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Professor Huxley]] (1891), [[William Kingdom Clifford]], [[James Prescott Joule]] and Sir [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]] (1907). Clark reports a total of ''thirty-two'' [[Huxley family]] portraits during the half-century after his first marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Clark R.W. 1968. ''The Huxleys''. p98&lt;/ref&gt;

A photocopy of John Collier's ''Sitters Book'' (made in 1962 from the original in the possession of the artist's son) can be consulted in the [http://www.npg.org.uk/research/archive.php Heinz Archive and Library], [http://www.npg.org.uk/ National Portrait Gallery]. This is the artist's own handwritten record of all his portraits, including name of subject, date, fee charged, and details of any major exhibitions of the picture in question.

==Posthumous reputation==
[[File:Clytemnestra by John Collier, 1882.jpg|thumb|''[[Clytemnestra]]'' by John Collier, 1882]]
[[Image:A Glass of Wine with Caesar Borgia - John Collier.jpg|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;''A glass of wine with [[Caesar Borgia]]'' 1893]]

Collier died in 1934.  His entry in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' (volume for 1931–40, published 1949) compares his work to that of [[Frank Holl]] because of its solemnity. This is only true, however, of his many portraits of distinguished old men &amp;mdash; his portraits of younger men, women and children, and his so-called "[[problem picture]]s", covering scenes of ordinary life, are often very bright and fresh.

His entry in the ''Dictionary of Art'' (1996 vol 7, p569), by [[Geoffrey Ashton]], refers to the invisibility of his brush strokes as a "rather unexciting and flat use of paint" but contrasts that with "Collier's strong and surprising sense of colour" which "created a disconcerting verisimilitude in both mood and appearance".

The ''Dictionary of Portrait Painters in Britain up to 1920'' (1997) describes his portraits as "painterly works with a fresh use of light and colour".

==Public collections==
[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?search=sa&amp;sText=John+Collier&amp;LinkID=mp00970&amp;role=art&amp;page=2 Sixteen] of John Collier's paintings are now in the collections of the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] in London, and [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/WorksList?searchid=24221&amp;page=1 two] are in the [[Tate Gallery]]. Four of the National Portrait Gallery paintings were in December 1997 on display:  [http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=sa&amp;sText=John+Collier&amp;LinkID=mp00970&amp;rNo=5&amp;role=art John Burns], [http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=sa&amp;sText=John+Collier&amp;LinkID=mp00970&amp;rNo=9&amp;role=art Sir William Huggins], [http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=sa&amp;sText=John+Collier&amp;LinkID=mp00970&amp;rNo=2&amp;role=art Thomas Huxley] (the artist's father in law) and [http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=sa&amp;sText=John+Collier&amp;LinkID=mp00970&amp;rNo=1&amp;role=art Charles Darwin] (copies of the last two are also prominently displayed at the top of the staircase at the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in London).

A 1907 self-portrait has been preserved in the [[Uffizi]] in Florence which presumably commissioned it as part of its celebrated collection of artists’ self-portraits.

Other pictures may be seen in houses and institutions open to the public: a large and striking painting of the murderess Clytemnestra is in the [[Guildhall Art Gallery|Guildhall Gallery]] of the City of London. The ''Death Sentence'' was given by the widow of the artist to [[Wolverhampton Art Gallery]]. His portrait of the [[William Onslow, 4th Earl of Onslow|Earl of Onslow]] (1903), is at [[Clandon Park]], [[Surrey]] ([[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]). His full-length portrait of Sir [[Charles Tertius Mander]], first baronet, is at [[Owlpen Manor]], [[Gloucestershire]], with another version in the collection of the National Trust at [[Wightwick Manor]], and his ''[[Lady Godiva (painting)|Lady Godiva]]'' is in the [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]].

Reproductions of many others, from various collections, may be consulted in the John Collier box in the National Portrait Gallery Heinz Archive and Library, and a good selection is published in ''The Art of the Honourable John Collier'' by W.H. Pollock (1914).  His work was also included in the Great Victorian Pictures exhibition mounted by the [[Arts Council]] in 1978 (catalogue, p27).

== Views on ethics and religion ==
[[Image:Tannhäuser en el Venusberg, por John Collier.jpg|thumb|''[[Tannhäuser]] in the Venusberg '' 1901]]
[[File:Lilith (John Collier painting).jpg|thumb|''[[Lilith (painting)|Lilith]]'', 1887, now held at the [[Atkinson Art Gallery and Library|Atkinson Art Gallery]]]]
Collier's views on [[religion]] and [[ethics]] are interesting for their comparison with the views of [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas]] and [[Julian Huxley]], both of whom gave [[Romanes lecture]]s on that subject. In ''The religion of an artist'' (1926) Collier explains "It [the book] is mostly concerned with ethics apart from religion... I am looking forward to a time when ethics will have taken the place of religion... My religion is really negative. [The benefits of religion] can be attained by other means which are less conducive to strife and which put less strain on upon the reasoning faculties." On [[secular morality]]: "My standard is frankly [[utilitarian]]. As far as morality is intuitive, I think it may be reduced to an inherent impulse of kindliness towards our fellow citizens." His views on ethics, then, were very close to the [[agnosticism]] of T.H. Huxley and the [[humanism]] of Julian Huxley.

On the idea of [[God]]: "People may claim without much exaggeration that the belief in God is universal. They omit to add that superstition, often of the most degraded kind, is just as universal." And "An omnipotent Deity who sentences even the vilest of his creatures to eternal torture is infinitely more cruel than the cruellest man." And on the Church: "To me, as to most Englishmen, the triumph of [[Roman Catholicism]] would mean an unspeakable disaster to the cause of [[civilization]]." And on [[non-conformists]]: "They have a superstitious belief in the actual words of the [[Bible]] which is very dangerous".&lt;ref&gt;Quotations from Collier, J. 1926. ''The religion of an artist''. Watts, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''L'Ymagier''''', subtitled "A Magazine of Engravings", was a French [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] art magazine edited by [[Alfred Jarry]] and [[Remy de Gourmont]] between 1894 and 1895. It ran for five issues and disbanded one year after its first printing, but in that time it published many prints and engravings by influential artists of the time, including [[Henri Rousseau]].

== Beginnings ==
Jarry, a French playwright and artist, and Gourmont, a novelist and poet of the same nationality, had worked in woodcuttings for many years before they joined together to form the magazine, although both men were so poor at times that they were forced to experiment with other mediums, such as [[linoleum]] and soap for their cuttings. Jarry had also been fascinated with the editorial aspects of publication since he, Francois Coulon and Louis Lormel had collaborated on ''L’Art Litteraire'' in 1893–94, which Jarry contributed to and Lormel edited. Jarry and Gourmont founded their own magazine in 1894 with a modest fortune, thus giving them a venue through which they would have complete artistic control over the expression and presentation of both their art and their interests.

=== Symbolism ===

Jarry wrote in ''L’Ymagier'' of the power of the direct and [[archetype|archetypal]] symbol, and set about comparing those symbols, such as the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] and the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] to the deliberately primitive pieces of [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], as well as many of his own works. The theme of the universal, primitive, and often childish forces at work in art and society was one that both Jarry and Gourmont would revisit often in their own writing and artwork, particularly in Jarry’s most famous play "[[Ubu Roi]]." The two also attempted to impress in their magazine the rejection of an optical reality, and instead tried to return art to a place of cult and ritual, hence the heavy religious imagery which peppered several of the issues.

== Publication ==
The first issue was published in October 1894, and was entitled "The Passion" as it contained many woodcuttings depicting the Passion of [[Christ]]. It was filled with elaborate and striking religious imagery, yet it was followed shortly by the shockingly graphic and unusual issue "Monsters" in January 1895. Following that was an issue in April 1895 entitled "The Virgin and [[Child Jesus|Christ Child]]" and then a revisiting of "The Passion" in July of the same year. The final issue, published in October 1895 was the most sparse of all. It was entitled "[[Gingerbread man|Gingerbread Figures]]" and contained only five pictures, four published under the name Alain Jans, Jarry’s nom-de-plume, and one which was unsigned. Shortly after this issue Jarry and Gourmont separated and the magazine quietly died out.

=== Contributors ===
Aside from Jarry and Gourmont, ''L'Ymagier'' published engravings from Gauguin, Bernard, Francois Georgin, a renowned woodcutter of the day, and Henri Rousseau who developed the status of cult artist due to his work in the magazine and was consistently one of its most popular contributors.

== Afterwards ==
Following his father’s death in 1895 Jarry used his inheritance to found ''Perhinderion'', a journal whose title is a [[Breton language|Breton]] word for [[pilgrimage]]. The journal was dedicated to juxtaposing conflicting elements often seen separately in art, such as intellectuality and naiveté, as well as presenting the complete works of [[Albrecht Dürer]], a 15th-century painter and printmaker from Germany. Special attention was paid to Dürer’s ''[[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]]'' which is highly symbolist in the way it moves between the formal and the hallucinatory. Jarry declared in the first issue of ''Perhinderion'' that the reproductions of the woodcuts would be [[photoengraving|photoengraved]]&amp;nbsp;... without reducing their size, and struck&amp;nbsp;... on [[laid paper]], which is the most similar to the original paper." This, along with the lavish format, led production costs to be so high that publication was discontinued after only two issues.
Though short lived, Jarry and Gourmont’s work in ''L’Ymagier'' and the magazine’s highly symbolist style influenced many artists and writers of the early 20th century, notably [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Max Jacob]], who would build on Jarry and Gourmont’s work in symbolism through [[Surrealism]] and [[Dada]]ism in the 1900s.

After the battle, the actor playing Princess Fuun is revealed to be Koyuki Kazahana, the daughter of the previous ''[[daimyō]]'' of the Land of Snow. Unwilling to accept her role as ruler, she attempts to run away but is found by Naruto, who encourages her to keep on trying, no matter the odds.

Doto abducts Koyuki, hoping to use her keystone necklace to activate the hidden treasure in the Land of Snow. In a pitched battle, Naruto defeats Doto, and the treasure is revealed to be a generator that turned the Land of Snow into the Land of Spring and memories of Koyuki and Sotetsu Kazahana discussing about what Koyuki was going to be when she turns old. As the group leaves, Naruto receives a signed autograph from Koyuki, who has agreed to assume her duties as ''daimyō''.

|ShortSummary =  [[Konohamaru]] is in love with a girl, Yoshino Kaede, who is moving away from the village. He wishes to win her heart with a crimson [[four-leaf clover]], which is also supposed to grant any wish. Konohamaru asks [[Naruto Uzumaki]] to help him find it, but they have to travel into the forbidden zone, Akagahara, to retrieve it. After activating almost every trap on the way to the clover, the pair are attacked by marionettes after moving a statue to reach the clover. [[Sasuke Uchiha]] and [[Sakura Haruno]] appear to help, but they still cannot defeat them. At last, the marionettes shut off after Konohamaru lifts the statue back to its original position. Then, one of the leaves fall off. Konohamaru still gives the clover to Kaede, and she kisses him on his cheek.

Shibuki is a coward, however, due to circumstances surrounding his father's death. The Hidden Village has a secret bottle of water called the "Hero's Water", which imbues whoever drinks it with a dramatic, but temporary, increase in chakra. The effects are similar to opening a "chakra gate", in that it can shorten lifespan as well. Five missing-nin come to the village to steal the Hero's Water, and Team 7 defends against the incursion.

The '''Lopen Roman Mosaic''' is a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mosaic]], probably from a [[Roman villa]], in the village of [[Lopen]], [[Somerset]], England.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen R. Cosh, David S. Neal: ''Roman Mosaics of Britain.'' Volume 2: ''South-West Britain.'' Illuminata Publishers for the Society of Antiquaries of London, London 2005, {{ISBN|0-9547916-1-4}}, p.&amp;nbsp;247–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was discovered in 2001, by George Caton who was operating a mechanical digger and noticed small cubes of coloured stone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lopen.btck.co.uk/LopensRomanMosaic/10DiscoveryoftheMosaic|title=The Discovery of the Mosaic|publisher=Lopen Village|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which turned out to be part of the floor of an eight-roomed Roman Villa and is the largest Roman Mosaic so far discovered in Britain.&lt;ref name="warren"&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Derrick|title=Curious Somerset|year=2005|publisher=Sutton Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0-7509-4057-3|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photogrammetry by [[English Heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=English Heritage|title=Photogrammetry and the Lopen Mosaic|url=http://www.lopenmosaic.co.uk/pdfs/photogrammetry.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Lopen Mosaic|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was followed by excavation  led by the [[Somerset County Council]] archaeologist. They exposed and documented the mosaic in three weeks. It was then covered with sand and soil to preserve it. The work was recognised with the award of the Tarmac Finders Award (for non professionals) at the British Archaeological Awards in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Archaeology Awards 2002|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/awards/baa2002.html#tarmac|publisher=Council for British Archaeology|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stones used for the mosaic are [[Blue Lias]] from the surrounding hills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prudden|first=Hugh|title=Geology Report|url=http://www.lopen.btck.co.uk/LopensRomanMosaic/12MosaicMaterials}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fragments which were discovered in the surrounding soil were used to create a new mosaic, including a picture of a dolphin, using methods which would have been available in Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reconstructed panel|url=http://www.lopen.btck.co.uk/LopensRomanMosaic/20Reconstruction|publisher=Lopen Village|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now displayed in All Saints Church.&lt;ref name="warren"/&gt;

A further mosaic was found in an adjoining room, which probably extended beyond the area excavated, which was about 4.5 metres square. The main mosaic is almost 7 metres square and has a complicated geometrical design, including some stylized figurative elements such as leaves, cups and dolphins. It was probably laid by a putative specialist workshop based at [[Cirencester]], known as the "Saltire school" for their fondness for [[saltire]]s in designs, which is seen here.  The walls of these rooms were probably also painted on plaster, but no traces survive here.  The suite probably functioned as a dining room

== Plot ==
'''Lost &amp; Found''' is basically a love story of Manas ([[Siddharth Chandekar]]) and Naina ([[Spruha Joshi]]) dealing with loneliness in their personal lives. Since loneliness has become a prominent part of our urban lives, Lost &amp; Found empathizes ignored human emotions with a basic motive of bringing happiness in the lives of lonely people. The four characters – Manas, Naina, Maruti (Mangesh Desai) &amp; Shrirang Kaka ([[Mohan Agashe]]) take an initiative against loneliness and thereby resurrecting their own lonely lives.

'''Martin Powell''', (''fl''. 1709–1720; d. 1729) was an Irish master puppeteer{{r|"grantley"}} and [[puppetry|puppet show]] [[impresario]], who put on a repertoire of satirical and parodical [[marionette]] shows that invariably featured the [[Pulcinella|Punch]] character. He drew audiences first at provincial towns such as [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], then moving his venue to London. His theatre (dubbed "Punch's Opera" or "Punch's Theatre") established itself in early 1710 at its first location, at the north end of St. Martin's Street intersected by Litchfield St., not quite in [[Covent Garden]]. But by 1711 he relocated the theatre to the galleries of Covent Garden, at Little Piazza, opposite [[St. Paul's, Covent Garden|St. Paul's Church]].{{sfnp|Nicoll|1925|loc=II, 430}}{{r|"bond-p61"}}

He has been credited with establishing the stock form of the [[Punch and Judy]] plays.{{r|"dnb"}} [[Charles Magnin]], the learned author of the ''Histoire des Marionnettes en Europe'', calls the years of Powell's pre-eminence "the golden age of marionettes in England." It has been commented "Powell is described as a deformed cripple{{sfnp|Morley|1888|loc=No. 14, p.26n|ps=: annotated new edition of ''Spectator''}} but his powers of satire were considerable,"{{r|"dnb"}} to the extent that the ministry recruited Powell to lampoon the [[French prophets]] to diminish their influence among the populace.{{sfnp|Morley|1888|loc=No. 14, p.26n|ps=: annotated new edition of ''Spectator''}} He not only narrated (spoke the lengthy prologues), with a wand in hand,{{r|"chambers"}} but was a puppeteer himself, and he is thought to have built his own puppet figures and written the plays himself.{{sfnp|Speaight|1952|p=48|ps="it is assumed he made his own figures, and wrote his own plays, he was certainly the author of ''Venus and Adonis''"}}

A 20th-century scholar assesses the period of Powell's prominent activity to be 1709–1720,{{sfnp|Shershow|1995|p=113}} the popularity of his puppetry having waned in the latter years, "his son briefly carried on the tradition in the [1720s]",{{r|kahan}} and he died 1729.{{r|"bond-p61"}}{{efn|''DNB'' gives "fl. 1709–1729"}}

==Repertoire==

===Bath===
In Bath (1709), Powell had his success with, e.g., ''[[The Creation of the World]]'', which in its [[Noah's Flood]] segment featured "Punch and his wife dancing in the Ark."{{r|"tatler-16"}}{{efn|''Tatler'' No. 16 describes ''The Creation of the World'' as the work of an anonymous puppeteer; later (''Tatler'' No. 44) this puppetter from "a former paper" is divulged to be "Mr. Powel" [sic.] ({{Harvnb|Shershow|1995|p=139}}).}} ''The Creation of the World,'' was also later put on by Powell at [[Bartholomew Fair]].{{Harvnb|Shershow|1995|p=113}} This puppet show was not exclusive to Powell at the time, and a puppeteer known as "Crawley" staged it at Southwark Fair in 1695, and later at Bartholomew Fair in 1727.{{r|"chambers"}}{{r|"highfill"}}

*''[[The Children in the Wood]]'',{{sfnp|Burnet|1715|p=219}} was "presumably performed at Bath".{{sfnp|Speaight|1952|p=51, n25}}
*''[[Mother Shipton]]'',{{sfnp|Burnet|1715|p=219}} together with ''The Seven Champions of Christendom'' and ''Valentine and Orson.''{{sfnp|Speaight|1952|p=42}}

===Covent Garden===
Once in London, in an escalated rivalry with [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket]] (i.e., with serious dramas and operas), he arranged various puppet operas, including:{{r|"dnb"}}

*"[[King Bladud]], Founder of the Bath" (1711{{sfnp|Speaight|1952|p=39|ps=: Jan. 27, 1711}})
*''The City Rake'' (''The Town Rake, or Punch turn'd Quaker'') 1711{{r|"bond-p61"}}{{sfnp|Speaight|1952|p=39|ps=: "''Bladud'' was followed by a week of ''The City Rake'', 'a new entertainment..'"}}{{sfnp|Nicoll|1925|loc=II, 385}})
*''The History of Sir Richard Whittington'' ("[[Dick Whittington and His Cat|The True and Ancient History of Sir Richard Whittington, Thrice Lord Mayor of London, and his Cat]]") (1711{{sfnp|Nicoll|1925|loc=II, 384}}{{sfnp|Nicoll|1925|loc=II, 385|ps=: "[After ''City Rake'' premiered].. ''Bladud'' came back.. and was succeeded by ''The History of Sir Richard Whittington'', an old puppet favourite".}})

==Response==
One contemporary observer who often wrote following Martin Powell's career was [[Richard Steele]], as an editor of the 1709–1710 journal ''[[Tatler (1709 journal)|Tatler, or the Lucubrations of Isaac Bickerstaff]]'' and later of the 1711 journal ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]''. In the ''Tatler'', Steele assumed the persona of [[Isaac Bickerstaff|Isaac Bickerstaff, Esquire]], writing a (feigned) affront that Powell was mocking Bickerstaff through the puppet Punch.{{r|"tatler-44&amp;50"}} Not much here can be taken at face value, since the venom against Powell is in jest (characterized "bantering allusions"{{r|"dnb"}}), the purported letter written by Powell to the editor is a "fictitious" fabrication,{{sfnp|Shershow|1995|p=143}} and in the subtext it is really about a veiled defense of his friend [[Benjamin Hoadly]] in his church and state dispute against [[Ofspring Blackall]], [[Bishop of Exeter]].{{sfnp|Shershow|1995|p=141}}{{r|"berguer"}}

Following up the bantering allusions to Powell in the ''Tatler'', [[Richard Steele]], in the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'' (No. 14), made the [[wikt:under-sexton|under-sexton]] of [[St. Paul's, Covent Garden]], write to complain that his congregation took the warning of his bell, morning and evening, to go to a puppet show set forth by one Powell under the [[piazza]]s. "I have placed my son at the piazzas to acquaint the ladies that the bell rings for church, and that it stands on the other side of the garden; but they only laugh at the child." Another correspondent writes describing Powell's show, which he compares favourably with the opera at the Haymarket; "for whereas the living properties at the Haymarket were ill trained, Powell has so well disciplined his pig that in the first scene he and Punch dance a [[minuet]] together".{{r|"dnb"}}

When the fanatics called [[French prophets]] were creating disturbances in [[Moorfields]], the ministry ordered Powell to make Punch turn prophet, which he did so well that it soon put an end to the prophets and their prophecies. In 1710, says [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]], the French prophets were totally extinguished by a puppet show.{{r|"chesterfield"}}

On 20 April 1710 [[Narcissus Luttrell|Luttrell]] mentions that four Indian sachems who were visiting London went to see Powell's entertainment. In the ''Groans of Great Britain'' (1711), formerly considered to be [[Daniel Defoe]]'s work, [[Charles Gildon]] (d. 1724) complains of Powell's popularity, and states that his wealth was sufficient to buy up all the poets of England. "He seldom goes out without his chair, and thrives on this incredible folly to that degree that, were he a freeman, he might hope that some future puppet show might celebrate his being Lord Mayor as he hath done [[Dick Whittington and His Cat|Dick Whittington]]." Steele, who saw Powell as late as 1729, states that he made a generous use of his money.{{r|"dnb"}}

Martin Powell's shows lost popularity in within a matter of few years,{{sfnp|Shershow|1995|pp=143–144}} and dropped out into obscurity after a mention in the anonlymous pamphleteer ballad, ''Bartholomew Fair: An Heroi-Comical Poem'' (1717).{{sfnp|Shershow|1995|pp=113, 143}}

In 1715, [[Thomas Burnet (judge)|Thomas Burnet]] wrote a brief biography entitled ''A Second Tale of a Tub, or History of Robert Powell the Puppet Showman.'' The substitution of Robert for Powell's real name, Martin, was made to render the obvious satire upon [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], [[Earl of Oxford]] more effective.{{r|"dnb"}}

The '''Michael Howard Studios''' is an acting studio for the [[performing arts]] located in at 152 West 25th Street in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]], New York City; the studio was founded in 1953 by actor/director [[Michael Howard (American actor)|Michael Howard]].

==History==
A protégé of both [[Sanford Meisner]] at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] and [[Lee Strasberg]] at the [[Actors Studio]], Howard established his Studio in 1953 grounded in the work of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. Over the years, the studio incorporated many schools of thought and techniques from around the world.

The Studio attributes its existence to the [[Group Theatre (New York City)|Group Theatre]]. In 1931, [[Harold Clurman]], [[Cheryl Crawford]], and Strasberg founded the Group Theatre in New York, beginning a watershed period in American Theater. The Group Theatre brought together [[Elia Kazan]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Sanford Meisner]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[Clifford Odets]], [[Irwin Shaw]], and [[John Garfield]] (among many others). Their creative commune introduced America to the revolutionary teachings of Stanislavski, and it set in motion new schools of thought that would dominate acting for the rest of the century. The Group Theatre closed its doors in 1941, and its visionary members set out in new directions.

In 1942, Howard joined the Neighborhood Playhouse as a scholarship student under Sanford Meisner. Howard vigorously pursued his studies and absorbed everything Meisner had to impart. Howard then served in World War II as a parachutist, and upon returning, joined Equity in 1947. Strasberg invited Howard to study with him, and soon he was asked to become a member of the Actors Studio. Howard began a long career of hundreds of roles on stage and screen, including Odets' ''[[The Country Girl (1950 play)|The Country Girl]]'' on Broadway and the film ''[[The Men (film)|The Men]]'' with Marlon Brando. Acting led to directing and, in 1952, to teaching, when [[Sidney Lumet]] asked Howard to replace him at the [[High School of Performing Arts]]. The next year, in 1953, a group of actors asked Howard to lead their sessions, and Michael Howard Studios was born.

Over the next five decades, Howard's teachings expanded to the Yale School of Drama, the [[Juilliard School]], the American Conservatory Theatre, and Boston University while continuing his master classes at the Michael Howard Studios.

The studio is now in its 55th year in continuous operation making it the longest running private acting studio in New York. In honor of the 55th anniversary of the studio, the studio received an official proclamation from Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], declaring May 4, 2009, Michael Howard Studios Day "in honor of the studio's contribution to New York's rich theatrical history".{{Cite quote|date=November 2017}}

'''Miss Riboet's Orion''', originally known as the '''Orion Opera''', was a theatrical troupe active in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now  [[Indonesia]]) in the 1920s and early 1930s. Established by the husband and wife team [[Tio Tek Djien]] and Miss Riboet, the company travelled throughout the Indies and performed various acts, particularly those with action scenes. It was disbanded in 1942, having lost much of its popularity due to competition with [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]].

==History==
In the late 19th century various forms of popular theatre, inspired by Western techniques and formats, began to develop in the [[Dutch East Indies]], a colony of the Netherlands. The earliest were the Malayan ''[[bangsawan]]'' troupes, who traveled to [[Sumatra]] and [[Java]] beginning in the 1880s. The ''Komedi Stamboel'' developed in the Indies in the 1890s, inspired by these ''bangsawan'' troupes. By 1910 various organisations run by the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] had begun holding stage performances, which they termed "operas", as fundraisers; these troupes eventually developed into professional ones, acting for profit.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|pp=106–10}}

In 1925 [[Tio Tek Djien]] (1895–1975),{{sfn|Cohen|2007|p=162}} an ethnic Chinese businessman from East Java, established Orion Opera together with his wife, Miss Riboet ({{circa}} 1900–1965), who took the lead role. Though Tio drew on the earlier ''bangsawan'' and ''komedi stamboel'', as with his contemporaries such as Tengku Katan's Union Dahlia, he introduced several changes. Stories selected were shorter ones, with shorter scenes, which could be completed in a single night. No longer were the characters introduced before the performance, and the number of scenes with singing and dancing was drastically reduced, limited only to inter-act performances. Orion's [[repertoire]] was likewise different: instead of traditional tales, such as those based on the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', Orion tended to perform original stories, though it also produced some adaptations of Western works.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|pp=114–15}}

Initially the troupe's original stories were written by Tio himself.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|pp=114–15}} By the late 1920s he had hired [[Njoo Cheong Seng]], a journalist and writer, to help produce original scripts.{{sfn|Setyautama|Mihardja|2008|pp=253–254}} Works by Njoo which the troupe performed included ''Kiamat'' (''Apocalypse''), ''Tengkorak'' (''Skull''), and ''Tueng Balah'',{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=13}} while Tio wrote such works as ''R.A. Soemantri''. These stories were most often filled with action, and, though written in detail, left room for improvisation. When Miss Riboet proved highly popular as a swordfighter in these plays, as well as a ''[[kroncong]]'' singer, the troupe was named after her.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|pp=114–15}}

[[File:Miss Riboet's Orion gramophone ad.jpg|thumb|An advertisement for [[gramophone record]]s featuring Miss Riboet's vocals]]
Though initially limited to an amusement park in [[Central Java]],{{sfn|Cohen|2007|p=161}} the troupe quickly proved popular and travelled from city to city. They sold [[gramophone record]]s to supplement their income,{{sfn|De Indische Courant 1926, (untitled)}} and Miss Riboet became the first recording star of the Indies.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=338}} Stores sold Miss Riboet brand merchandise, including wristwatches.{{sfn|Cohen|2007|p=162}} In 1927 the company attempted to make a film. Tio asked [[Wong brothers|Nelson Wong]] to first record the troupe's performances, a task which Wong did using a simple camera. Hoping to create a profitable [[fiction film]], Tio asked Wong to direct, a request Wong accept as long as Tio would help bring Wong's brothers from China. When the brothers arrived in the Indies, Tio bought an old [[tapioca flour]] factory in [[Bandung]] for them to use as a studio.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=81}} Nelson and Tio began plans to make a film starring Miss Riboet, but these were cancelled after discovering that Riboet's face was "not photogenic".{{efn|Original: ''... wajahnya tidak baik untuk kamera.''}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=82}}

In 1926 another theatrical troupe, [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]], was established by Willy A. Piedro. As with Miss Riboet's Orion, Dardanella quickly became known for its action-themed plays, a repertoire which included several stories about [[Zorro]] and an adaptation of ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' in Batavia; such was the troupe's popularity that its leading man, [[Tan Tjeng Bok]], was soon styled the "[[Douglas Fairbanks]] of Java". By 1931 the competition from Dardanella had led to an advertising war between the two troupes, each focusing on their best-received works: ''Gagak Solo'' from Miss Riboet's Orion and ''Dr Samsi'' from Dardanella.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|pp=115–16}}

In 1934 Njoo and his wife, the actress [[Fifi Young]], migrated to Dardanella. Though Orion continued to perform, it was unable to compete with Dardanella. It was disbanded during the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]] (1942–1945).{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=131}} After 1950 Tio attempted to reunite the troupe, but was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Cohen|2007|p=162}}

==Reception and legacy==
Indonesian literary scholar Jakob Sumardjo writes that Miss Riboet's Orion laid the basis for modern theatre in Indonesia, a feat he attributes to both Tio and Njoo having been well educated (as opposed to earlier, business-oriented, theatre patrons).{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|pp=114–15}} Contemporary critic Tzu You, writing in 1939, considered Miss Riboet's Orion to have had the potential to create high quality, literary, stage plays, but that said potential was wasted as Tio focused only on following the public's tastes.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|pp=114–15}} An anonymous review in ''[[De Indische Courant]]'' recommended the opera company as a good one, particularly praising Miss Riboet's singing and acting.{{sfn|De Indische Courant 1926, Operettegezelschap 'Orion'}}

A stageplay put on by Miss Riboet's, entitled ''Pembalesan Siti Akbari'', was reprinted by the [[Lontar Foundation]] in 2006 using the [[EYD|Perfected Spelling System]]. The play is an adaptation of [[Lie Kim Hok]]'s 1884 poem ''[[Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari]]''.{{sfn|Lontar Foundation|2006|p=155}}

[[Image:Platform Artists Group Inc.jpg|thumbnail|Platform Artists Group Inc. [[Campbell Arcade]]]]
'''Platform Artists Group Inc.''', commonly known as '''Platform''', is Australia's longest operating [[artist-run initiative]]. The organisation develops exhibitions of [[visual arts]] by  artists from Australia and around the world. Platform primarily consists of 3 separate spaces, all located in and under the busy [[Flinders Lane]] precinct in the heart of [[Melbourne]] city.

Most of the activities of Platform are located in the [[Campbell Arcade]] subway under [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders Street]] in Melbourne. A pedestrian poll conducted in 2005 by [[Connex Melbourne|Connex]] estimated that more than 35,000 people a week pass through the Platform exhibition sites, making it one of the most visible sites for public art in Melbourne.

Platform provides support for many young artists by enabling them to present solo exhibitions and the organisation often debuts artists to the general public. In its 23 years of operation, Platform has presented new work from more than 2,500 artists. Many have established successful art careers and have become well-respected professional artists. Many exhibiting artists are now featured in major Australian and international public art collections and several have represented Australia at the Venice Biennale.

== History of Platform Artists Group Inc. ==

Founded in 1990 by artists Andrew Seward and Richard Holt, Platform's first location was a collection of glass display cases in the old [[Southern Cross railway station|Spencer Street station]] pedestrian underpass. In 1995, the [[City of Melbourne]] offered the group another underground space, Campbell Arcade, a subway located under Flinders Street and connecting [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] to [[Degraves Street]]. The late [[Art deco]]-style arcade was opened on 31 August 1955 and features black marble columns and pink-tiled walls lined with glass display cases. Platform expanded the exhibition program into this second space, running group and solo exhibitions at both the city's major train stations.

In 2000, Platform Artists Group further expanded the organisation into a subway shop they named Sticky. Promoting and selling [[Artist books]] and [[Zines]], Sticky has since become an independent organisation and one of Australia's largest sellers of zines, stocking work from the United States, UK, Germany, France, China, Japan and New Zealand.

In 2004, the Spencer Street site was destroyed as part of the redevelopment of the station. Platform continues to deliver an ambitious contemporary art program at Campbell Arcade, Flinders Street Station under the new title, Platform Public Contemporary Art Spaces. In 2010, Platform marked its 20th Anniversary by publishing the book, ''What Art, Which Public?''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thethousands.com.au/melbourne/look/twenty-years-of-platform/ Twenty Years of Platform, Three Thousand (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

His style evolved to become more [[Indian art|Indian]] as his career went on – he painted [[Mughal emperors]] and drew particularly Indian heads, using similar techniques.

A total of 25 paintings have been attributed to Shaykh 'Abbasi, including [[illuminated manuscript|illuminations]] from manuscripts and [[Persian miniature|miniatures]] featuring, among other subjects, the [[Safavid]] emperors and the [[Madonna and Child]], colored in pale, transparent tones. Given the activities of contemporaneous artists, it is highly likely that he also painted on objects made from [[papier-mâché]] that was [[lacquer]]ed.

"'''The Nature of Mind'''" is a philosophical essay by [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]], originally published in ''The Nature of Mind and Other Essays'' in 1980.&lt;ref name=ess&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/9629061?q=0801413532&amp;c=book# "The nature of mind and other essays / D.M. Armstrong"] on [[National_Library_of_Australia#Trove|Trove]]. Retrieved 30 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Armstrong outlines a philosophical account of the [[mind]] that is compatible with the [[Materialism|Materialist]] scientific view of the mind. He arrives at a theory of Central-State Materialism, a [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] between [[René Descartes|Descartes']] [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] (the thesis) and [[Gilbert Ryle|Gilbert Ryle's]] dispositional behaviourism (the antithesis).

== Structure and arguments ==
The essay begins with the simple assertion that "men have minds",&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Armstrong suggests that modern science may be the best tool with which to investigate the nature of the mind. He says that it seems that scientific consensus is converging on an explanation of the mind in "purely physico-chemical terms".&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 1"/&gt; He acknowledges some disagreement on the matter, but says that dissent tends to be on primarily non-scientific grounds. Armstrong writes that the purpose of his essay is to outline a Materialist account of the nature of the mind - one that is compatible with the scientific view of an entirely physico-chemical mind.

=== The Authority of Science ===
Armstrong states that [[science]] can achieve consensus among experts on controversial matters after prolonged investigation. This, he says, makes science the authority on the nature of the mind and other matters. It is recognized that science can make mistakes, and that some claim that science has a limited sphere of inquiry. He puts forward science as the best hope we have in understanding the mind.

=== Defining the Mental ===
Returning to the search for a Materialist account of the mind, Armstrong considers [[Behaviourism]], which holds that the mind "is not something behind the behaviour of the body, it [is] simply part of that physical behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Behaviourism fits nicely with a Materialist view of the mind, it has significant flaws - it is possible to feel or think something without acting on this feeling or thought. For instance, one can feel [[anger|angry]] but not express anger. 

Armstrong looks at [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s refinement of Behaviourism, Dispositional Behaviourism. Armstrong illustrates Ryle's idea with a description of [[glass]] - brittleness is the disposition of materials such as glass to shatter under certain circumstances. Whether or not the glass shatters in a particular instance, it has the disposition to do so. In the same way, a mind can have a disposition towards anger, but it may only express this anger under certain circumstances. Armstrong quotes Ryle's ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'': {{Quotation | "To possess a dispositional property is not to be in a particular state, or to undergo a particular change, it is to be bound or liable to be in a particular state, or to undergo a particular change, when a particular change is realized."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryle|1949|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; | Gilbert Ryle| The Concept of Mind'', 1949'}}
While this dispositionalism quite successfully deals with the objection that one can feel or think one thing and do another, it is not enough - "it seems obvious as anything is obvious that there is something actually going on in me that constitutes my thought".&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryle's Dispositional Behaviourism denies this, and so Armstrong declares it to be "unsatisfactory as a theory of mind".&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 7"/&gt; Though he rejects Behaviourism, Armstrong suggests that it is useful to say that the mind and mental states are "logically tied to behaviour".&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 7"/&gt; He says that "thought is not speech under suitable circumstances, rather it is something within the person that, in suitable circumstances, brings about speech." He thinks this view is compatible with a Materialist view of the mind, though it is also compatible with non-Materialist views, such as [[Descartes]]'.

Armstrong modifies Ryle's Behaviourism by suggesting that the mind's dispositions may be explainable by science in Materialist terms, in the same way that glass's brittleness can be explained in terms of molecular structure. Armstrong offers this view as a true account of the mind. It is more fully developed in ''Belief, Truth and Knowledge'' (1973), ch. 2, sect. 2.

Armstrong brings together two earlier conclusions: that the mind is "that which stands behind and brings about our complex behaviour";&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 10"&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Behaviourist's dispositions are "states that underlie behaviour and, under certain circumstances, bring about behaviour",&lt;ref name="Armstrong 1980 10"/&gt; and reaches "a conception of a mental state as a state of the person apt for producing certain ranges of behaviour".

=== The Problem of Consciousness ===
Armstrong now addresses what he calls 'the problem of consciousness': how can the personal experience of consciousness be explained by his Materialist theory of the mind? Armstrong considers times when the brain goes on 'auto-pilot' - during long drives without breaks, one might suddenly 'come to' and realize that while one has stayed on the road, stopped at red lights and operated the clutch, one was completely unaware of doing so. This shows that it is possible for mental processes to take place without conscious experience.

Before considering how this can be the case, Armstrong describes a method by which a psychologist may determine whether an animal can distinguish between two colours by training it to perform a task that requires this perception. The animal's behaviour would indicate its perception of the colours. While a Behaviourist would say that the animal's behaviour ''was'' its perception, Armstrong describes the perception as a state of the animal's mind. It is implied that one could test for consciousness using a similar method.

Further illustrating his idea, Armstrong gives an analogy in which perception is a key to a door, the door being action. The unlocking of the door, and therefore action, is optional, but one cannot open the door without the key. A blind man, for instance, lacks certain keys. As a result, he cannot operate in an environment in the same way that a sighted man can.

Using this conception of perception as a state, Armstrong characterizes consciousness as "perception or awareness of the state of our own mind",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "a self-scanning system in the central nervous system".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Armstrong|1980|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sees consciousness not as an external construct that interacts with the body and brain, but a self-aware state of the physical brain.

[[Image:Theatre du Chatelet 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Auditorium of the Théâtre du Châtelet, 2008]]
The '''Théâtre du Châtelet''' ({{IPA-fr|teɑtʁ dy ʃatlɛ}}) is a [[theatre]] and [[opera house]], located in the [[place du Châtelet]] in the [[1st arrondissement of Paris]], [[France]].

One of two theatres (the other being the [[Théâtre de la Ville]]) built on the site of a ''châtelet'', a small castle or fortress, it was designed by [[Gabriel Davioud]] at the request of [[Baron Haussmann]] between 1860 and 1862. Originally named the Théâtre Impérial du Châtelet, it has undergone remodeling and name changes over the years. Currently it seats 2,500 people.

==Description==
The theatre is one of two apparent twins constructed along the quays of the [[Seine]], facing each other across the open [[Place du Châtelet]]. The other is the [[Théâtre de la Ville]]. Their external architecture is essentially [[Palladian]] entrances under arcades, although their interior layouts differ considerably. At the centre of the plaza is an ornate, [[sphinx]]-endowed fountain, erected in 1808, which commemorates [[Napoleon]]'s victory in [[Egypt]].

== Origins ==
[[Image:Theatre du Chatelet-Gabriel Davioud-187x.jpg|thumb|left|The theatre ca. 1875]]

The Théâtre Impérial du Châtelet was built for [[Hippolyte Hostein]]'s equestrian company, the Théâtre Impérial du Cirque, whose previous theatre, the [[Cirque Olympique (boulevard du Temple)|Cirque Olympique]] on the [[Boulevard du Temple]], was slated for demolition by [[Baron Haussmann]] to allow the construction of the Boulevard du Prince-Eugène (now the [[Boulevard Voltaire]]).&lt;ref name=Wild76&gt;Wild 1989, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site for the new theatre was acquired by the [[Paris|City of Paris]] in October 1859, and construction took place between 1860 and 1862. The interior designers included Eugène Carrières and Armand Cambon, and the curtain was created by [[Charles Cambon]].&lt;ref name=Wild76/&gt;

The theatre originally seated 2,200 people, although Haussmann claimed it held 3,600.&lt;ref&gt;According to a document in the [[Archives Nationales]], the theatre seated 2,200 (Wild 1989, p. 76).&lt;/ref&gt; The repertory, fixed by a decree of 20 September 1862, included military works and ''[[féeries]]'' in one or several acts, as well as dramas and [[Comédie en vaudevilles|''vaudevilles'']].&lt;ref&gt;Wild 1989, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hostein left as director in September 1868. [[Nestor Roqueplan]] ran the theatre from 1 July 1869 to April 1870.&lt;ref name=Wild76/&gt;

==Fall of the Second Empire==
The theatre was closed from September 1870 to July 1871 due to the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The war brought about the fall of the [[Second French Empire]], and under the succeeding [[French Third Republic]], the appellation ''impérial'' was dropped. Hippolyte Hostein returned as the theatre's director in 1873–1874.&lt;ref name=Wild76/&gt;

Notably, beginning in April 1876, the stage version of [[Jules Verne]]'s [[Around the World in Eighty Days]], adapted by Verne and [[Adolphe d'Ennery]], began a run spanning sixty-four years and 2,195 performances (although not continuously). It was only the Nazi occupation of Paris in May 1940 that closed this production permanently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anao.pagesperso-orange.fr/oeuvre/tourmonde.html History of the production] on anao.pagesperso-orange.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

Into the 20th Century, the theatre was used for [[operetta]]s, variety and ballet performances, for classical and popular music concerts. It was also, for a time, a cinema. Regular seasons of opera and ballet were presented by a variety of impresarios, among them [[Gabriel Astruc]], who introduced [[Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] here. [[Igor Stravinsky]]’s ''[[Petrouchka]]'' received its premiere in the theatre on 13 June 1911, as did [[Erik Satie]] and [[Jean Cocteau]]’s ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' on 18 May 1917. In addition, many foreign composers and conductors made appearances in the theatre, including [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Richard Strauss]].

== Recent history ==
Since 1979, it has been operated by the City of Paris, and, after undergoing a major restoration, re-opened under the name of Théâtre Musical de Paris in 1980. It was acoustically re-modeled again in 1989 and reverted to the Théâtre du Châtelet name. It is currently mainly used for opera performances and concerts.

Under the direction of [[Stéphane Lissner]] for four years from 1995, the theatre received additional improvements in acoustics and sightlines.

In recent years, the theatre has become the home of the [[Orchestre de Paris]] and the [[Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France]]. Since 1993 the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] of [[London]] has an annual residency period. [[Shirley Horn]] recorded her 1992 live album ''[[I Love You, Paris]]'' at the Théâtre du Châtelet.
