The '''African Institute for Future Studies''', also known as '''Panafrican Institute for Future Studies''' or '''INADEP''', is a research institution and university founded in 1989 by the President of Zaire (present day [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) (Ordinance 89–287 of 9 November 1989). It is located in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], though it was originally located in [[Zomba, Malawi|Zomba]], [[Malawi]]. In addition to subsidiary departments that are funded for the future studies or for the exploration of the future, INADEP has funded a Centre for the exploration of the past, named Diop's Center for Egyptology.&lt;ref&gt;Unesco, Ali Al'Amin Mazrui, Christophe Wondji (eds.) Africa since 1935. International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa, University of California Press, (1999)
{{ISBN|0-520-06703-7}} p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt; INADEP is a member of the National Research Council of Congo and one of the National Government Organizations devoted exclusively to scientific research and to the training of new researchers.

==Origin==
In 1976 the United Nations, through its Economic Commission for Africa (EGA) launched the idea of founding an African Institute for Studies of the Future. In 1977, the IXth Conference for ECA ministers defined the objectives of the Institute. In 1980m Professor Mahdi Elmandjra conducted a feasibility study entitled Report on the Desirability and Feasibility of Establishing an African Institute for Advanced public Policy Analysis and Future Studies. In 1981, the OAU summit held in Nairobi approved the idea of founding an Institute for decolonising the future. In 1982, the Conference for EGA Ministers approved the idea of establishing the Institute. In 1987 the book ''Reconquering the Future'' was published at the request of UNDP.

==Foundation==
In  1985, the International Symposium on Africa and its Future thinks it is appropriate to start an African Centre for Studies of the Future. President Mobutu Sese Seko agrees to the idea and offers to provide initial infrastructural facilities in Kinshasa.

Ordinance 89–287 of 9 November 1989 prescribed the foundation of a public institution called ''Institut Africain d'Etudes Prospectives'' (INADEP), and in 1990 the Center for Egyptology was added. The chairman of the Centre for Egyptology is Mubabinge Bilolo.

==Objectives==
The Institute is an Africa-oriented study centre and, as such, pursues the following main objectives:
*Provide institutional facilities for long term research on international, political, cultural, economic, sociological, and technical modifications to the African or world situation in the present or in the future
*assess strategies, indicate the various options available, and offer a just and balanced picture of the future as well as propose directives for a planified realisation of the objectives proposed &lt;ref&gt;Article 3 of the ordinance&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
The INADEP receives support and encouragement from international institutions such as UNDP, OAU, EGA, UNESCO, UNICEF, ABDA, ABD, EEC, and the World Bank. It also receives support from specialised centres in France, Great Britain, Germany, the United States, Scandinavian Countries, Japan, and the Soviet Union.

==Programme==
===Immediate actions===
The programme includes a campaign for the cohesion of African countries and for obtaining of assistance expected from international organisations.

===Departments of the institute===
*Documentation and basic equipment department
*Centre for computerised data
*Research units

==Activities==
*General concepts and methods of future studies
*Analysis and definition of Main Directions of development
*''Bibliologie'' or graphic communication
*Training by means of conferences, retraining and in-service sessions, short courses, and other means
*Organisation of colloquia and symposia

'''Alatau Tamchiboulac Atkinson''' (November 16, 1848– April 24,1906) was the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the [[Territory of Hawaii]], and Inspector General of Schools under the administrations of [[Kalākaua]], [[Liliʻuokalani]] and [[Sanford B. Dole]]. A journalist and newspaper owner, he is believed to have been one of two authors of satirical works lampooning [[Walter Murray Gibson]]{{'s }} cabinet regime under Kalākaua.

==Background==
He was born in the small town of Kapal in the [[Kazakh steppes]] of Central Asia, to British explorers [[Lucy Atkinson]] and [[Thomas Witlam Atkinson]], and spent the first ten years of his life in [[Siberia]], Central Asia, and St Petersburg. After his father's death in Kent, England when Alatau was 10 years old, a public fund-raising appeal by [[Sir Roderick Murchison]], President of the Royal Geographical Society, helped finance Alatau's education at Rugby School. After a brief career in Russia as Secretary of the Turko-Russian boundary commission, he changed careers to become a writer for the British newspaper the ''Newcastle Courant''. He briefly held a teaching career in England at [[Durham School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lockley|first=Fred |title=Romantic Story of Honolulan |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24826513/romantic_story_of_honolulan/ |work=The Honolulu Advertiser at Newspapers.com |date=May 11, 1930|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawaii's school system==
An 1854 treaty for Hawaii's annexation to the United States had been submitted to Kamehameha III, but he never signed it. During the 1863–1872 reign of [[Kamehameha V]], the Hawaiian language was still the predominant communication in Hawaii's schools. Increasing exposure to the outside world was being brought by the sea trade, missionaries, and foreigners operating sugar plantations in the islands.  In 1867, a proposed reciprocity treaty, tax relief for sugar planters, had gotten as far as the United States Congress, but was defeated in the Senate.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1953|pp=37, 209–224}}

Atkinson was offered a position by Bishop [[Thomas Nettleship Staley]] in 1868, to become instructor and principal at St. Alban's College in [[Pauoa, Hawaii]]. He left England together with his wife Annie (nee Humble) and his daughter Zoe in 1869 for the long sea journey to Hawaii. St. Alban's would later merge with [[ʻIolani School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History Timeline {{!}} ‘Iolani School |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104407/http://www.iolani.org/about/history/timeline |accessdate=October 30, 2018 |date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atkinson would later also be given charge of the Fort Street School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Warren |first1=Grace Tower |title=Kamaaina Kolumn by Grace Tower Warren - Newspapers.com |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24826358/kamaaina_kolumn_by_grace_tower_warren/ |work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin at Newspapers.com |date=September 21, 1957 |accessdate=October 30, 2018}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that fluency in a common language used by the outside world was a vital tool for the coming generations of Hawaiians.  It became his life's career to convert Hawaii's schools into using English as the predominant language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A. T.

In 1887 he was appointed Inspector General of Schools for the Kingdom of Hawaii. He served in that position under both Kalākaua and Liliʻuokalani. He remained in that position under Dole during the [[Republic of Hawaii]]. When Hawaii became a territory, Atkinson was appointed Superintendent of Public Instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Atkinson appointed Inspector General of Schools |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24906434/atkinson_appointed_inspector_general_of/ |accessdate=October 30, 2018 |work=The Hawaiian Gazette at Newspapers.com |date=August 2, 1887}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dole&gt;{{cite news |title=Alatau Atkinson Died Early Today |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24858604/alatau_atkinson_died_early_today/ |accessdate=October 26, 2018 |work=The Evening Bulletin at Newspapers.com |date=April 24, 1906}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elected representative==
Atkinson represented the Fourth District of Hawaii in the [[Legislature of the Republic of Hawaii]] for the February 16 – July 7, 1898 session.{{sfn|Lydecker|1918|p=247}} Hawaii was annexed by the United States on August 12 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Events In Order:Chronology of Annexation in 45 Paragraphs |url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1898-08-16/ed-1/seq-3/ |accessdate=October 30, 2018 |work=The Hawaiian Gazette |date=August 16, 1898 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==

Atkinson was editor of the ''Hawaiian Gazette'', and was president of Hawaiian Star Newspaper Association.&lt;ref name=Dole/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hawaiian Gazette masthead |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24881197/hawaiian_gazette_masthead/ |accessdate=October 30, 2018 |work=Newspapers.com |date=September 7, 1886}}{{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and/or Vice Chamberlain [[Edward William Purvis]] are to believed to be the authors of  ''The Grand Duke of Gynbergdrinkenstein'', a 3-act burlesque originally published in 1886 as a satirical jab at [[Kalākaua]]'s cabinet under the helm of [[Walter M. Gibson]].{{sfn|Atkinson|Purvis|1886}}{{sfn|Atkinson|Purvis|1887}}   The character of Herr Von Boss was believed to be wealthy sugar baron [[Claus Spreckels]]. A second version was published in 1887 as ''The Gynberg Ballads''. British Commissioner [[James Hay Wodehouse]] believed the satire rang true to the king's cabinet under Gibson, and made sure numerous officials in London received copies.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|p=346}}

'''Authentic assessment''' is the measurement of "intellectual accomplishments that are worthwhile, significant, and meaningful,"&lt;ref&gt;Wehlage, Newmann, &amp; Secada, 1996, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; as contrasted to multiple choice [[standardized tests]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.wce.wwu.edu/Resources/CEP/METT/2006/Performance-Based%20Pedagogy%20Assessment%20of%20Teacher%20Candidates%20.pdf#search=%22terry%20bergeson%20reasoning%20rs%22   Performance-Based Pedagogy Assessment of Teacher Candidates] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830001238/http://www.wce.wwu.edu/Resources/CEP/METT/2006/Performance-Based%20Pedagogy%20Assessment%20of%20Teacher%20Candidates%20.pdf#search=%22terry%20bergeson%20reasoning%20rs%22 |date=August 30, 2006 }}'', Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction, June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Authentic assessment can be devised by the teacher, or in collaboration with the student by engaging [[student voice]]. When applying authentic assessment to student learning and achievement, a teacher applies criteria related to “construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and the value of achievement beyond the school.” &lt;ref name="Authentic Intellectual Work in Social Studies: Putting Performance before Pedagogy"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Scheurman, Geoffrey |author2=Fred M. Newman|title=Authentic Intellectual Work in Social Studies: Putting Performance before Pedagogy|journal=Social Education|date=January 1, 1998|issue=62.1|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authentic assessment tends to focus on contextualised tasks, enabling students to demonstrate their competency in a more '[[Verisimilitude|authentic]]' setting. Examples of authentic assessment categories include:
* performance of the skills, or demonstrating use of a particular knowledge
* simulations and role plays
* studio portfolios, strategically selecting items

According to Meg Ormiston, "[[Authentic Learning|Authentic learning]] mirrors the tasks and problem solving that are required in the reality outside of school".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ormiston|first=Meg|title=Creating a Digital-Rich Classroom: Teaching &amp; Learning in a Web 2.0 World|year=2011|publisher=Solution Tree Press|isbn=978-1-935249-87-0|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This framework for assessment begins the same way curriculum design begins, with the question: What should students be able to do?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mueller|first=Jon|title=How Do You Create Authentic Assessments?|url=http://jfmueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/howdoyoudoit.htm|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the instructor answers that question, they can then devise a [[rubric (academic)|rubric]] to evaluate how well a student demonstrates the ability to complete the task. Because most authentic assessments require a judgement of the degree of quality, they tend toward the subjective end of the assessment scale. Rubrics are an "attempt to make subjective measurements as objective, clear, consistent, and as defensible as possible by explicitly defining the criteria on which performance or achievement should be judged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Rubric - by any other name? |url=http://www.morningside.edu/academics/research/assessment/documents/ARubricbyanyothername.pdf |work=morningside.edu/ |accessdate=6 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529234906/http://www.morningside.edu/academics/research/assessment/documents/ARubricbyanyothername.pdf |archivedate=29 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Authentic vs. traditional ==
[[Traditional education|Traditionally]], assessment follows curriculum. Authentic assessment is an example of "backwards design" because the curriculum follows from the assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mueller|first=Jon|title=Traditional Assessment vs. Authentic Assessment|url=http://www.cssvt.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Traditional-vs-Authentic-Assessment.pdf|work=Jon Mueller’s Authentic Assessment Toolbox|publisher=cssvt.org|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

One case study was presented by [[Edutopia]]'s Schools That Work series on New York based institution, School of the Future. This school stresses the process of authentically assessing students rather than focusing solely on test results or term papers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edutopia.org/stw-assessment-school-of-the-future&lt;/ref&gt; The school measures the full range of student ability through formative assessments, presentations, exhibitions, and tests that focus on authentic tasks to assess students' skills and knowledge as they relate to real-world endeavors and skills such as effective group communication and presentation. 98% of students at this school go on to college after graduating.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edutopia.org/stw-assessment&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classroom implementation==

Teachers from The School of The Future in New York utilize authentic assessment in their school and recommend that other teachers can do the same by following the guidelines outlined below:

*Write the assessment before the lesson plan
*Outline learning standards on rubrics to help to ensure rigor
*Warm students up to learning with notecard exercises each morning
*Use in-class pop quizzes to assess student understanding and inform teaching
*Give qualitative feedback 
*Ask students to reflect and assess themselves
*Use online or traditional tools to track a student’s work quality over time
&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"&gt;http://www.edutopia.org/stw-assessment-ten-lessons-get-started&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

A goal of authentic assessment is to determine if student knowledge can be applied outside of the classroom. This means that a physics assessment should involve doing physics by performing experiments and solving problems the same way that a real-life physicist would. An authentic history assessment requires students to ask questions, do independent research, and formulate answers to their questions, just like a real-life historian does.&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"/&gt; 
What else is authentic assessment meant to do?
* It engages students and is based in content or media in which the students actually have a genuine interest.
* It asks students to synthesize information and use critical-thinking skills.
* It is a learning experience in and of itself. 
* It measures not just what students remember but how they think.
* It helps students understand where they are academically and helps teachers know how to best teach them.

{{Marxism|Variants}}

The '''Budapest School''' ({{lang-hu|Budapesti iskola}}; {{lang-de|Budapester Schule}}) was a [[school of thought]], originally of [[Marxist humanism]], but later of [[Post-Marxism]] and dissident [[Liberalism]] that emerged in [[Hungary]] in the early 1960s, belonging to so called Hungarian New Left. Its members were students or colleagues of [[Georg Lukács]]. The school was originally oriented towards developing Lukacs' later works on [[social ontology]] and [[aesthetics]], but quickly began to challenge the paradigm of Lukacsian-Marxism, thus reconstructing contemporary critical theory.  Most of the members later came to abandon [[Marxism]]. The School also critiqued the "dictatorship over needs" of the Soviet states. Most of the members were forced into exile by the pro-Soviet Hungarian government.

In a letter to the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' of February 15, 1971, Georg Lukács drew attention to “The Budapest School of Marxism,” and helped attract attention to the school from [[Western Marxism]].

Members of the school include [[Ágnes Heller]], [[Ferenc Fehér]] [[:hu:Fehér Ferenc (filozófus)|(hu)]], [[György Márkus]], [[István Mészáros (professor)|István Mészáros]], [[Mihály Vajda]] and [[Maria Márkus]], among others. The Budapest School's writings have been read and researched widely since the 1960s.

==History==
The [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] was one of the most important political events of Agnes Heller's life, for at this time she saw the effect of the academic freedoms of Marxist [[critical theory]] as dangerous to the entire political and social structure of Hungary. The uprising confirmed Heller’s ideas that what [[Karl Marx|Marx]] really intended is for the people to have political autonomy and collective determination of social life.

Lukács, Heller and other Marxist critical theorists emerged from the Revolution with the belief that Marxism and [[socialism]] needed to be applied to different nations in individual ways, effectively questioning the role of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985)|Soviet Union]] in Hungary’s future. These ideas set Heller on an ideological collision course with the new Moscow-supported government of [[János Kádár]]: Heller was again expelled from the Communist Party and she was dismissed from the University in 1958 for refusing to indict Lukács as a collaborator in the Revolution. She was not able to resume her research until 1963, when she was invited to join the Sociological Institute at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences|Hungarian Academy]] as a researcher (Tormey 4–18) (Grumley 5–15). 
   
From 1963 can be seen the emergence of what would later be called the “Budapest School”, a philosophical forum that was formed by Lukács to promote the renewal of Marxist criticism in the face of [[actually existing socialism]] and its theories. Other participants in the Budapest School included together with Heller her second husband Ferenc Fehér, György Márkus, Mihály Vajda and some other scholars with looser connections to the school (such as [[András Hegedüs]], [[István Eörsi]], [[János Kis]] and [[György Bence]]). The School emphasized the idea of the renaissance of Marxism, described by radical philosophy scholar [[Simon Tormey]] as "a flowering of the critical, oppositional potential they believed lay within Marxism and in particular within the ‘early Marx’ ... the Marxism of the individual ‘rich in needs,' of solidarity and self-governance ... they hoped to precipitate a crisis in those systems that had the temerity to call themselves 'socialist'."

Heller’s work from this period, concentrates on themes such as what Marx means to the character of modern societies; liberation theory as applied to the individual; the work of changing society and government from “the bottom up,” and affecting change through the level of the values, beliefs and customs of "everyday life". Since 1990, Heller has been more interested in the issues of aesthetics in ''The Concept of The Beautiful'' (1998), ''Time Is Out of Joint'' (2002), and ''Immortal Comedy'' (2005).

The Budapest School carried out research on the Political Economy of both the Soviet Union and Western Capitalism. The School accepted many of the critiques of Soviet planning and inefficiency from [[Neoclassical Economics]], as well as the connection between markets and freedom. The Soviet system was condemned as a dictatorship over needs. The school also analyzed the [[mixed economies]] of modern capitalism. Most traditional Marxist economics was jettisoned. [[Economy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Nordic Model]] was held as a model of the mixed economy and managed capitalism. The School advocated Radical Democracy as a solution to the authoritarian and undemocratic features of the mixed economy.

==Ágnes Heller==

Heller was born in 1929. It is well known that she is the most prominent philosopher and aesthetician from Budapest School, and one of the most representative critical theorists from Eastern European Neo-Marxists. She has published more than forty books on social theory, the theory of history, the philosophy of ethics and moral and political philosophy. Since 1990s, she has been paying more attention to issues of aesthetics.

'''Dead week''' is a [[slang]] term for the week before schools' [[final examination]]s in the [[United States of America]]. The week is known thus because of its notorious [[Stress (biology)|stress]]; the propensity for [[college]] and [[university]] students to save exam study until the last possible week; and because [[homework|term paper]]s are often due. Students prepare for the exams and papers by engaging in all-night studying sessions, often with the aid of stimulants such as [[coffee]], [[caffeine tablet]]s, [[energy drink]]s, [[adderall]],  or other prescription amphetamines.  During this period, some students suffer from [[sleep deprivation]], increased irritability, and [[stress (medicine)| vomiting]].  At some schools, this week is referred to as ''Hell Week'', ''Reading Period'', or ''Reading Week''.

Many campus dormitories/residence halls require near silence for most of the day during the week before finals, to aid to those studying for their finals or writing papers.  Depending on the school there may also be a moratorium on paper assignments, exams, and student organizational activities during dead week. Libraries may also be open for extended hours, or might stay available all night.

==Yelling tradition==

Many schools have a tradition, known by various names, where students open their doors and windows and scream as loudly as they can (usually at midnight) on one or all nights of this week.

== College-specific examples ==

* At [[Iowa State University]], Dead Week has become an official University-recognized event. Student organizations are not allowed to meet. There are 23/7 mandatory quiet hours in the student dormitories (the non-quiet, 24th hour is dubbed Rowdy Hour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/opinion/article_0b8ac866-1f70-11e1-bf44-001871e3ce6c.html|title=Verhasselt: Dead Week is a myth|last=heath.verhasselt@iowastatedaily.com|first=Heath Verhasselt,|website=Iowa State Daily|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* At [[Yale University]], the Pundits, a nominally anonymous student group, organizes a [[streaking|naked run]] through [[Bass Library]], where many students study for their exams. The event is usually around midnight and the runners hand out candy to the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=August |first=Hillary |date=April 1, 2005 |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/13856 |title=For the true prankster, every day is April Fool's |publisher=Yale Daily News |accessdate=May 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619005222/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/13856 |archivedate=June 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Cornell University]], students scream as loudly as possible out of their windows at midnight the night before the first day of finals. This is known as the midnight scream. 
* At [[Columbia University]], students open their windows at midnight and scream as loudly as possible on the Sunday of finals week each semester, popularly known as the Primal Scream. The tradition helps students release their pent up stress and anxiety about exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Johnson|first = Soterios|date = May 11, 2005 | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4648537 | title = Spring Scream at Columbia | format = Real Audio, Windows Media Player | work = All Things Considered | publisher = National Public Radio | accessdate = August 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At midnight the eve of the first Monday of finals, students participate in a [[Pillow fight#Organized pillow fights|Spring Pillow Fight]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikicu.com/Spring_Pillow_Fight Columbia University's Spring Pillow Fight]&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], professors that give traditional exams may assign homework and projects during dead week, but may not assign tests, quizzes, lab reports and lab practicums. Professors that give a non traditional exam, such as a project or lab report, may give homework and the alternate exam assignment during dead week or finals week.  Tests, quizzes, and additional lab reports and lab practicums are not allowed during dead week. In either case, professors cannot give any assignment besides the exam during finals week.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whistle.gatech.edu/archives/09/nov/30/dead.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, many professors take advantage of this and assign homework and projects during dead week. On the Friday of Dead Week, freShGA (freshman leadership organization) hosts its annual One Night Stand. Starting at 10pm and going until 4am, students spend the Friday of Dead Week at the Campus Recreation Center for a night of sport competitions, relays, and tournaments with free food and amazing prizes. Also, Midnight Madness occurs every night during dead week  and students scream to vent frustration at midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/tbook/older/traditions/midnightmadness.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220170746/http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/tbook/older/traditions/midnightmadness.html |archivedate=2008-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Northwestern University]], there is a tradition known as the "Primal Scream" that takes place at 9 pm on the Sunday night before finals week. The Primal Scream marks the end of reading week, a time when most classes are not in session, and the beginning of finals week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugadm.northwestern.edu/freshman/campuslife/traditions.htm Northwestern Traditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226213318/http://www.ugadm.northwestern.edu/freshman/campuslife/traditions.htm |date=2008-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[University of California, Berkeley]], students may choose to participate in a [[streaking|naked run]] through [[Moffit Library]] in an effort to relieve their stress.
* At [[University of Vermont]], students get together at midnight on the last day of classes for the [[streaking|naked bike ride]] through Athletic Campus. Students can bike or run. [https://vtcynic.com/culture/life/the-legacy-of-naked-bike-riding-at-uvm/]

[[File:US Navy 031114-N-6436W-003 Commanding Officer, Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Capt. Stephen Black will be the last person in Naval Aviation history to ride the famous Dilbert Dunker.jpg|thumb|Dilbert Dunker in [[Naval Air Station Whidbey Island]] now replaced by a newer system for egress training]]
The '''Dilbert Dunker''' is a device for training [[Aviator|pilot]]s on how to correctly escape a submerged plane. 

It was invented by Wilfred Kaneb, a nautical engineer, during [[World War II]].

The device was featured in the [[1982 in film|1982]] film, ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]'', starring [[Richard Gere]] and [[Debra Winger]].

The word Dilbert is not listed in the dictionary although the term is used in the United States Navy to define a person who is slow witted and incapable of getting things done correctly {see [[Robert_C._Osborn#World_War_II:_the_Dilbert_Years|Dilbert the Pilot]], a World War II-era cartoon character who is a bumbling navy pilot}. It is combined with "dunker" because a mockup cockpit (SNJ in the 40's and 50's) is sent down a 45 degree rail from a high stand at the deep end of the training pool, and at the end of the run under water it flips inverted to simulate a water ditching.  The preflight student must detach the communication wire from the helmet, release the seat and shoulder harness, dive still deeper and swim away from the "aircraft" at a 45 degree angle to the surface for the purpose of assuming that the water around an actual situation has burning fuel on the water's surface.

The '''Doctor of Project Management''' (DPM) is a research-oriented professional [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]] offered by some [[Australia]]n universities, such as RMIT University in Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} It is of the same academic level as traditional PhD; however, the research focus is on industry practice rather than theoretical framework.

'''Dyslexia-associated protein KIAA0319''' is a [[protein]] which in humans is encoded by the ''KIAA0319'' [[gene]].&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: KIAA0319 KIAA0319| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=9856| access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9205841"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nagase T, Ishikawa K, Nakajima D, Ohira M, Seki N, Miyajima N, Tanaka A, Kotani H, Nomura N, Ohara O | title = Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes.

== Clinical significance ==

Variants of the KIAA0319 gene have been associated with developmental [[dyslexia]].&lt;ref name="pmid15717286"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cope N, Harold D, Hill G, Moskvina V, Stevenson J, Holmans P, Owen MJ, O'Donovan MC, Williams J | title = Strong evidence that KIAA0319 on chromosome 6p is a susceptibility gene for developmental dyslexia | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = 581–91 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15717286 | pmc = 1199296 | doi = 10.1086/429131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading disability, or dyslexia, is a major social, educational, and mental health problem. In spite of average intelligence and adequate educational opportunities, 5 to 10% of school children have substantial reading deficits. Twin and family studies have shown a substantial genetic component to this disorder, with heritable variation estimated at 50 to 70%.&lt;ref name="entrez" /&gt;

A mutation in a gene on chromosome 6, called the KIAA0319 gene, appears to play a key role in [[Specific Language Impairment]].&lt;ref name="pmid19997522"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rice ML, Smith SD, Gayán J | title = Convergent genetic linkage and associations to language, speech and reading measures in families of probands with Specific Language Impairment | journal = Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 264–82 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19997522 | pmc = 2788915 | doi = 10.1007/s11689-009-9031-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18466916"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibson CJ, Gruen JR | title = The human lexinome: genes of language and reading | journal = Journal of Communication Disorders | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 409–20 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18466916 | pmc = 2488410 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcomdis.2008.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3403">The '''Education Act 1646''' was an Act of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] (1646 c.46) that ordered locally funded, Church-supervised schools to be established in every [[Parish#Church of Scotland|parish]] in [[Scotland]]. It was passed by the Parliament at [[St Andrews|St. Andrews]] on 2 February 1646 in the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], titled "'''Act for founding of schools in every parish'''."

The act stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707 |publisher= K.M. Brown et al. eds (St Andrews, 2007 &amp;ndash; 2009), 1645/11/185 |url= http://www.rps.ac.uk/search.php?a=fcf&amp;fn=charlesi_trans&amp;id=id12080&amp;t=trans |accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that for every [[Parish#Church of Scotland|parish]] without a school and paid schoolmaster:
* a school will be founded and a schoolmaster appointed with the advice of the [[Presbyterian polity#Presbytery|presbytery]].
* to this end, the [[heritor]]s of every congregation will meet and provide:
** a suitable house for the school.
** an annual stipend for the schoolmaster, between 100-200 [[Merk (coin)|merk]]s.
** a new tax on land and outdoor property to pay for these.
* if the heritors do not do this, a panel of 12 men will be appointed by the presbytery, and the panel is empowered to do it and assess the new tax.
* if the new tax is not paid, the debt is doubled, [[letters of horning]] are issued, and further actions will be taken; and if the tax is still not paid, the debt is repeatedly redoubled until it has been paid.
* [[Liferent (Scots law)|life-rent]]ers owe the new tax on their rented land, just as if they were heritors.
* it is lawful for any person to petition the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]] for redress of any perceived inequality, if done within a year and a day.

The act reflected the current status of the ongoing [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]-[[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] power struggle by specifying school supervision by [[Presbyterian church governance|presbyteries]] (the Presbyterian view; the Episcopalian view was supervision by [[bishop]]s).

This act had the same purpose as the [[Education Act 1633]], which had been only partially successful because it had required the consent of those paying the tax, or of members of the congregation. That consent was not always given, but this act allowed the presbytery to ensure that it was done, and placed stiff penalties on those who did not comply. However, this act (of 1646) was passed amidst the tumult of the [[English Civil War|civil war]]s, and was rescinded in 1661 when the political winds shifted with the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], so it never had the opportunity to become effective. It would be passed again 50 years later ([[Education Act 1696|Education Act of 1696]]), with little changed but the use of more modern (i.e. 50 years later) wording.

== Education levels ==
*One or two years of ''[[Preschool|Preschool Education]]'' (called ''kinder'', short for [[kindergarten]]), which is not part of the State's educational system.
*Nine years of ''[[Primary education|Basic Education]]'' divided in three ''cycles'' of three grades each:
**1st Cycle: from 1st to 3rd grades
**2nd Cycle: from 4th to 6th grades
**3rd Cycle: from 7th to 9th grades; which is a transition to [[secondary education]] (e.g. specialized teachers for each assignment).
*Two (or an optional three years technical program) of ''[[High school|Middle Education]]'', called ''[[bachillerato]]'':
**Two year ''General Bachelor's Degree''
**Three year ''Technical Bachelor's Degree'' (''e.g. Accounting, Secretariat, Electronics and Computer Science, etc.'')
*Five years (minimum) of ''[[Higher education|Higher Education]]'', consisting of [[University|university education]] or other [[tertiary education]].

== Dynamics ==
The national educational system is not the only one available. Pre-university education is not free. The State provides [[public education]] for which a fee is paid if the person paying can afford it and only one payment per family is made (i.e. siblings pay only one fee). Public education is inconsistent in quality, being extremely poor in rural areas and dubiously efficient in urban areas, becoming one of the State's greatest challenges. 

In 1992 the Minister of Education Cecilia Gallardo de Cano embarked on a reform program of basic education. In 2010 the literacy rate was 82% for both sexes.

{{See|List of universities in El Salvador}}

The [[University of El Salvador]] (UES) is the largest (and only) public university in the country. However, classes are constantly stopped for protests. The University of El Salvador has one main campus in San Salvador and three more campuses in Santa Ana, San Miguel and San Vicente. 

There are also [[List of universities in El Salvador|many private universities]] as alternatives to UES.

'''Expulsion''', or '''permanent exclusion''', refers to the removal or banning of a [[student]] from a [[school system]] or [[university]] due to persistent violation of that institution's rules, or in extreme cases, for a single offense of marked severity. Laws and procedures regarding expulsion vary between countries and states.

Various colloquialisms refer to this practice (for example, being "kicked out of school" or "sent down"). The alleged practice of pressuring parents to voluntarily withdraw their child from an educational institution is a comparable exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Tuzzolo, E., &amp; Hewitt, D. T. |journal=The high school journal |year=2006 |url=http://www.coweninstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/rebuilding-inequity.pdf |title=Rebuilding inequity: The re-emergence of the school-to-prison pipeline in New Orleans. |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=59–68 |format=PDF |quote=Other parents have indicated that instead of expelling students, some schools have simply adopted an informal “push out” policy. Reportedly, parents have been called into the school to discuss their children’s behavior; upon arriving they were presented with a pre-completed withdrawal form, asked to sign and find a “more suitable school” for their children. |accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

===State sector===
If a student(s) has been expelled from two schools, then any state school is legally allowed to refuse admittance of that student. (Schools on [[special measures]] may refuse to admit a student who has been expelled from only one school.) Therefore, a student who has been expelled from two schools might be totally removed from the state education system. As a result, it is rare for a pupil to be expelled (or ''permanently excluded'') in the UK's state sector.

The exclusion of pupils is governed by the [[Education Act 2002]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 12, ''A Guide to the Law for School Governors'', Community Schools edition. {{ISBN|1-84478-121-6}} / {{ISBN|1-84478-543-2}}. DfES reference GTTLC2004 / DFES-0227-2005. Crown copyright 2004 / 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State's]] guidance states that exclusion is a serious step. Exclusion should be used only in response to serious breaches of a school's [[discipline]] policy and only after a range of alternative strategies to resolve the pupil's disciplinary problems have been tried and proven to have failed; and where allowing the pupil to remain in school would be seriously detrimental to the education or welfare of other pupils and staff, or of the pupil himself or herself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In practice, a student can usually be subject to permanent exclusion for a total of five disciplinary breaches, for which the student does not have to receive formal 'warnings'. Depending on his or her offence, a child can be excluded from the school system within any range of time after his or her misdeed. Though the teaching staff may recommend a pupil to be expelled, only the [[headteacher]] is legally empowered to exclude a student; he or she is not permitted to delegate that power to another person, but if he or she is ill or otherwise unable to perform his or her duties, another staff member may become the acting headteacher and inherit the power to expel students.

When kicking a student out, the headteacher must inform the pupil's parents of the duration of the exclusion (whether it be temporary or permanent), reasons for exclusion, and the procedures which a parent may take to make an [[appeal]]. The headteacher must also inform the [[local education authority]] of the circumstances surrounding permanent exclusions, fixed-term exclusions exceeding five days, and exclusions which result in a student being unable to take a public [[test (assessment)|examination]].

====Reasons for expulsion====
A headteacher might kick a pupil out for a first or one-off incident of appropriate severity.&lt;ref name="improve"&gt;''Improving Behaviour And Attendance: Guidance On Exclusion From Schools and Pupil Referral Units'', DCSF. September 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-84775-160-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For a single case of one of the following, a pupil can be expelled permanently for:
* A serious act of violence, including actual or threatened violence against a staff member or another pupil
* Possession of a weapon
* A sexual offence, including [[sexual abuse]] and [[sexual assault|assault]]
* A [[racially-aggravated offence]]
* Severe [[hazing]] of another student
* A [[Psychoactive drug|drug]] offence, usually the supply of a controlled drug to other pupils (possession of a small amount of a '[[soft drug]]' such as [[tobacco]] or [[cannabis]] is not normally considered sufficient grounds for expulsion)
* [[Hacker (computer security)|Computer hacking]]

If a student has a history of breaking other school rules, that too could result in expulsion. In these cases, expulsion is used as a last resort if the student's behaviour has not improved. Some offences which may lead to expulsion when repeated persistently include:
* Defiance and rebellion against authority
* [[Vandalism]]
* [[Bullying]]
* [[Plagiarism]]
* [[Stealing]]
* [[False alarm]] (setting off the fire alarm when there is no fire or making hoax 999 calls)
* [[Gambling]]
* [[Terroristic threat]]
* [[Discrimination]]
* Fighting
* Pupils who have done nothing wrong to merit expulsion are sometimes expelled if the school does not expect them to achieve sufficiently high grades in external examinations.  This illegal policy seriously harms the life chances of young people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-44958372 Government 'complicit in school's illegal exclusion policy'] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
Since many violent students often rebel against school rules, some head teachers may choose to expel a student who has performed an act of violence against another pupil for ''persistent defiance'' rather than violence. This is in order to protect the victim from being assaulted again as revenge for the excluded student's expulsion. Some regard this "totting up" process of persistent defiance to be unfair, as the pupil will have often been punished once already for each act, and expulsion can be seen as a second punishment imposed after the matter had been settled.

====Appeals====
The pupil and his or her parents can appeal to the [[school governors]] against the expulsion. If the appeal fails to reinstate the pupil, a further appeal can be made to an appeals board (which sits on the behalf of the local education authority).

=====Appeals to the governors=====
The parents of an excluded pupil are entitled to appeal against expulsion or an exclusion exceeding five days to a panel of school governors acting as a court.

The panel, which consists of parents and staff and cannot include the headteacher, is not legally able to exclude a pupil or extend a term of exclusion; but it can convert a permanent exclusion to a fixed-term one, reduce the length of a fixed-term exclusion, or cancel an exclusion.

The appeal must occur no sooner than six days after and no more than 15 days after the exclusion begins. The panel considers oral, written, or physical [[evidence]] from the school detailing the case for expulsion, and from the parents of the excluded pupil. The pupil and his or her parents may argue that the excluded pupil was not responsible for the act for which he or she has been excluded, or that the punishment was disproportionate to the offence.

=====Appeal to the local education authority=====
If the appeal to the governors is unsuccessful, an expelled or excluded student and his or her parents may go to an appeals board. This panel, which is appointed by the local education authority, must be [[autonomous]] of the authority, the school, and the parents of the excluded student.&lt;ref name="improve" /&gt;

The majority of the appeals that these panels hear are not against exclusions, but are for the admission of pupils into schools. Although the local education authority are in theory obligated to provide education to a pupil under school-leaving age (Year 11 and below), in practice (usually when the pupil is denied access to other schools and/or the pupil referral unit) the local education authority employs techniques such as appointing a single tutor for one lesson a week.

====Legal advice and representation====

There are a number of projects that provide free legal representation to pupils who are appealing against their permanent exclusion from school.  The institution cited in letters detailing the reasons for permanent exclusions is the [[Coram Children's Legal Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.childrenslegalcentre.com&lt;/ref&gt;

There are voluntary groups who provide trainee lawyers to represent parents at both governing body appeals and independent appeal panels.  The City / Matrix Chambers School Exclusions Project is one such project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.city.ac.uk/law/careers/pro-bono-professional/information-for-clients/citymatrix-school-exclusions-project&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent sector===
In the [[independent school (UK)|independent]] sector, a pupil can be ‘permanently excluded’ at the discretion of the headteacher.

====Distinction between expulsion and rustication====
Whereas expulsion from a UK independent school means permanent removal from the school, [[Rustication (academia)|rustication]] or suspension usually means removal from the school for a set period, for example, the remainder of the current term.

==United States and Canada==

===Expulsion in General===
In the United States and Canada, expulsion criteria and process vary from state to state or province. Depending on local school board jurisdiction, approval from that school's local school board may be required before a student can be expelled, as opposed to a [[Suspension (punishment)|suspension]], which may require approval from the principal or a school board member, including the superintendent. Students who have been expelled from the school face numerous restrictions, in which they are no longer eligible to attend or visit the school, and are also disallowed from attending or performing any activity with any students or staff who are active with the school. Students who breach an expulsion, which includes visiting the school they have been expelled from, or perform or attend any activity with any students or staff who are active with the school, will be [[arrest|arrested]] for, and [[Indictment|charged]] with [[trespassing]]. Students are usually not expelled for academic violations such as [[plagiarism]] that would be punishable in college. However, in some jurosdictions such as [[California]], vulgarity (which is not defined anywhere within California law) is enough of a reason for a student to be expelled from any school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=48900&amp;lawCode=EDC Cal. Education Code §48900(i)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pupil Rights===
While in the [[Criminal Justice|Criminal]] or [[Juvenile Delinquency|Juvenile Justice]] one has enumerated and unenumerated rights upon accusation, pupils do not have such rights when within an expulsion process. For example, in California, pupils have the following rights:

*Have an expulsion hearing within 30 school days&lt;ref&gt;[http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=EDC&amp;division=4.&amp;title=2.&amp;part=27.&amp;chapter=6.&amp;article=1. Article 1 Chapter 6 Part 27 Division 4 Title 2 of the Cal. Education Code]&lt;/ref&gt;
*To appeal the results of an expulsion hearing
*To [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|remain silent]]

However there are rights that pupils do not have during the expulsion process that they would have in a court of law:

*An attorney [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|at no cost]] to the pupil
*To [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|cross examine]] any witness&lt;ref&gt; [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=EDC&amp;sectionNum=48918. Cal. Education Code §48918(f)(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*For the hearing to be heard by an independent party
*The [[Presumption of innocence|presumption of innocence]]
*To be found guilty only when the consensus is [[Reasonable doubt|beyond a resonable doubt]]
*Protection from [[Double jeopardy|double jeopardy]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expulsion Rates===
While at one time it was difficult for a student to be expelled from public school, that is no longer the case. A 2001 report from Justice Policy Institute showed that expulsions nearly doubled from 1974 to 1998; despite student victimization rates remaining stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Homeroom Security: School Discipline In An Age of Fear|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BzacO6Vl1tQC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=Aaron Kupchik|page=15|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York and London|isbn=978-0-8147-4845-9|accessdate=2015-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expulsion is especially high for students of color, even when their behavioral infractions are the same as those of white children, and teachers need to identify and combat bias to ensure all students are treated with equity.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, G. L., &amp; Thompson, R. (2014). ''Yes, you can!: Advice for teachers who want a great start and a great finish with their students of color''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990|Gun-Free School Zones Act]], and following the [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine shooting tragedy]], schools have become increasingly willing to suspend or have expelled students for minor behavior offenses.&lt;ref name="ztze"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~safeschl/ztze.pdf |title=Zero tolerance, zero evidence: An analysis of school disciplinary practice |author=Russell J.

Students who have been expelled from a building in primary and secondary schools typically are forced to attend class at an alternate location. [[Alternative school]]s are usually owned by the expelling school district for expelled students to attend daily lessons. Students have other options, such as boarding schools, private schools, and online courses, such as [[Apex Learning|APEX]] or [[K12 (company)|K-12]]. In some states, such as Wisconsin, other public school districts are not required to enroll students who are currently serving a term of expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/120/I/13/1/f |title=Wisconsin Statutes governing the power of school boards |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as permanent expulsion from a district, this type of statutory authority can have the effect of displacing an expelled student from the public education system of an entire state, effectively ending their educational career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1444&amp;context=twlj |title=EXPELLED TO NOWHERE: SCHOOL EXCLUSION LAWS IN MASSACHUSETTS |format=pdf |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to student discipline, there is a marked difference in procedure between public and private institutions. With public schools, the school must provide the student with constitutional due process protections as public educational institutions operate as an extension of state governments. With private schools, on the other hand, the student can be expelled for any reason – so long as the expulsion was not “arbitrary and capricious.” Generally, as long as a private school follows the procedures in its student handbook, a court will not view its actions as arbitrary and capricious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tenerowicz|first1=Lisa|title=Student Misconduct at Private Colleges and Universities: A Roadmap|journal=Boston College La Review|date=1 May 2001|volume=42|issue=3|page=653|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2179&amp;context=bclr|accessdate=19 July 2017}} ("In the absence of constitutional protections, courts generally have required that private school disciplinary proceedings adhere to a 'fundamental' or 'basic' fairness standard and not be arbitrary or capricious.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Mahaffey v. William Carey Univ., 180 So.3d 846 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8330093199603816876|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states (like Texas) report expulsion to the [[juvenile court]] system - the model in Texas was passed in 1995.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, '''Expulsion''' and '''exclusion''' are both terms for removing a student from a school for misconduct. The difference is students under 16 years of age are excluded and those 16 or over are expelled, but both are commonly referred to as expulsion. For students excluded, because they are under the minimum [[school leaving age]], the excluding school is required to find an alternative school for the student to attend, or reinstate the student if another school cannot be found. For students that are expelled, the expelling school is not required to find an alternative school, as the student is over the minimum school leaving age.

Exclusion/expulsion cannot be directly done by the principal. It must be done through [[suspension (punishment)#Academia|suspending]] the student, and requiring the school's [[board of trustees]], or a standing disciplinary committee of the board, to independently assess whether or not the situation is serious enough to justify exclusion or expulsion of the student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.minedu.govt.nz/educationSectors/Schools/SchoolOperations/StanddownsSuspensionsExclusionsExpulsions/EducationStanddownSuspensionExclusionExpulsionRules.aspx | title= New Zealand Ministry of Education - Education (Stand-down, Suspension, Exclusion, and Expulsion) Rules | accessdate= 2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, exclusions and expulsions rates were 2.41 and 2.01 per thousand students respectively. Students were more likely to be excluded or expelled if they were male, of Maori or Pacific Island descent, and/or attended a school with a low (1-4) [[Socio-Economic Decile|socioeconomic decile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/indicators/main/student-engagement-participation/80346 |title= Stand-downs, suspensions, exclusions and expulsions from school -- Indicators -- Education Counts |publisher= New Zealand Ministry of Education |accessdate= 11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common reasons for exclusions and expulsions in 2009 were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/indicators/data/student-engagement-participation/80379 |title= Exclusions from school -- Indicators -- Education Counts |publisher= New Zealand Ministry of Education |accessdate= 11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/indicators/data/student-engagement-participation/3728 |title= Expulsions from school -- Indicators -- Education Counts |publisher= New Zealand Ministry of Education |accessdate= 11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Continual disobedience – 41.2% of exclusions / 25.3% of expulsions 
* Drugs (incl. substance abuse) – 14.2% / 25.8%
* Physical assault on other students – 17.3% / 16.8%
* Theft – 4.4% / 8.9%
* Verbal assault on staff – 5.0% / 2.6%
* Physical assault on staff – 4.5% / 1.6%
* Weapons – 2.5% / 2.6%
* Vandalism – 1.3% / 2.6%
* Alcohol – 1.0% / 3.7%
* Verbal assault on other students – 1.1% / 0.5%

Arson, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and smoking were the other main reasons for exclusion and expulsion recorded.

==China==
In mainland China, expulsions of compulsory education schools are completely banned under the Article 27 of the Compulsory Education Act.

'''''Fifty Years of Freedom: A Study of the Development of the Ideas of A.&amp;nbsp;S. Neill''''' is a 1972 [[intellectual biography]] of the British [[pedagogue]] [[A.&amp;nbsp;S. Neill]] by Ray Hemmings. It traces how [[Homer Lane]], [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and others influenced Neill as he developed the "Summerhill idea", the philosophy of child autonomy behind his [[Summerhill School]]. The book follows Neill's early life and career in rural, [[Calvinist]] Scotland and continues through the influence of his mentors, Lane and Reich, and the origins of Summerhill after World War I. Written fifty years from Summerhill's founding, ''Fifty Years'' is a [[sociological]] and historical analysis of Neill's ideas in the context of intellectual and educational trends both during Neill's life and at the time of publication. Hemmings also surveyed [[progressive school]] leaders about Neill's impact on the field, and reported their perception of influence on teacher–pupil relations. ''Fifty Years'' was first published in England in 1972 by [[George Allen and Unwin]], and was later renamed '''''Children's Freedom: A. S. Neill and the Evolution of the Summerhill Idea''''' for its 1973 American publication by [[Schocken Books]].

Contemporary reviewers considered ''Fifty Years'' to be the best available biography of Neill. They largely praised its clarity and biographical detail and insight, but found the book's philosophical sections comparatively weak and the author biased, as a former teacher from the school.

''Fifty Years of Freedom'' is an [[intellectual biography]] of the British [[pedagogue]] [[A. S. Neill]] that traces the influence of [[Homer Lane]], [[Wilhelm Reich]],{{sfn|Curtis|1972}} [[Sigmund Freud]] and others on his thought.{{sfn|Nordberg|1973|p=112}} Released fifty years after the school's founding,{{sfn|Nordberg|1973|p=111}} the book is a [[sociological]] and historical analysis that presents the development of Neill's "Summerhill idea"—the philosophy of his [[Summerhill School]]—in context of related social, political, educational,{{sfn|Cowie|1973}} and  intellectual trends. Hemmings himself saw the work as less of a biography than an analysis of Neill's ideas in development and of the outward reception of these ideas.{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=243}} The book was first published in England in 1972 by [[George Allen and Unwin]]{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=243}} as ''Fifty Years of Freedom: A Study of the Development of the Ideas of A. S. Neill'',{{sfn|Cowie|1973}} and was later renamed ''Children's Freedom: A. S. Neill and the Evolution of the Summerhill Idea'' for its 1973 American publication by [[Schocken Books]].{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=243}} The book includes photographs.{{sfn|Nordberg|1973|p=112}}

The book follows the course of Neill's life sequentially{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=244}} from his youth in "rural, [[Calvinist]] Scotland" to the start of Summerhill between the two World Wars.{{sfn|Choice|1973}} Hemmings focuses on Neill's relation to education but also minds other biographical detail:{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=244}} the influence of Freudian [[psychoanalysis]] and Homer Lane's theories in the 1920s, and of Wilhelm Reich's psychological theories in the 1930s.{{sfn|Choice|1973}} Hemmings compares Neill's thought with that of [[Maria Montessori]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Fred Clarke]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Susan Sutherland Isaacs]], [[Benjamin Spock]],{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=244}} and contemporaries [[Paul Goodman]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[R. D. Laing]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]].{{sfn|Nordberg|1973|p=112}} Compared to pedagogues such as Russell, who advocated for the inculcation of certain virtues in a child's education, Neill instead insisted that the child be left to make its own values and decisions apart from adult influence and manipulation.{{sfn|Curtis|1972}} Hemmings also reviews the roles of [[freedom]], [[authority]], and [[anarchy]] throughout the maturation of Neill's thought.{{sfn|Neiderbach|1973}} The final sections explain Summerhill's internal processes, philosophy, and position in both British and global social order.{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=244}} Hemmings contends that Summerhill has remained consistent to its principles while it cycled through roles as one of many 1920s educational experiments, a bastion in the 1930s, and an advocate for "children's freedom" throughout the post-World War II movement for {{"'}}informal' education".{{sfn|Choice|1973}}

Hemmings conducted a study that surveyed 102 [[progressive education|progressive]] heads—broadly defined—of [[infant school|infant]], [[primary education|elementary]], and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools about Neill's influence. Their responses indicated that Neill had significant impact on how the profession perceived teacher–pupil relations. The respondents also reported significant influence from Neill on [[moral education|moral]] and [[sex education]]. Contrarily, Neill had little impact on school curriculum and classroom teaching methods. Hemmings received little response from heads of state [[Comprehensive school (England and Wales)|comprehensive schools]].{{sfn|Cowie|1973}}

Hemmings had previously taught at Summerhill.{{sfn|Curtis|1972}} In 1973, he was lecturer in Education at the [[University of Leicester]].{{sfn|Nordberg|1973|p=112}} Other contemporaneous and significant biographies of Neill include Neill's autobiography (''Neill!

Orange Peel!'', 1972) and Robert Skidelsky's Part Three of ''English Progressive Schools'' (1969).{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|pp=242–243}} [[Jonathan Croall]]'s ''Neill of Summerhill'' (1983) later cited Hemmings's book.{{sfn|Croall|1983b}}

== Reception ==

Though Hemmings did not think of his work as a biography,{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=243}} Richard L. Hopkins (''[[Comparative Education Review]]'') said it essentially was strongest as one.{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=244}} Hopkins wrote in 1976 that Hemmings's book was the best biography of Neill available at the time, and called it "comprehensive", "objective", and "sympathetically thoughtful". In comparison, Neill's autobiography "rambles" and Skidelsky's biography "preens" over "small insights", while Hemmings unpacks larger issues to contextualize "a complex man in a complex world".{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=244}} Reflecting on these three biographies of Neill, Hopkins added that Hemmings's book would interest "comparative educators" most, as that it addressed the two points readers would find most interesting about Neill: the role of his history on his ideas, and the role of his ideas in the outside world.{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=243}} Still, Hopkins thought many readers would find the work "too long and detailed".{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=244}} Hopkins himself found Hemmings's book "a struggle to work through", though more complete compared to Neill's "easy", "stream-of-consciousness" prose.{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=244}} Leonard W. Cowie (''[[British Journal of Educational Studies]]'') said that ''Fifty Years'' was written with "great competence" and would be both "interesting and essential" for those interested in understanding Neill.{{sfn|Cowie|1973}} ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'' recommended the "excellent volume" for "all readership levels", and considered it more telling than Neill's own autobiography.{{sfn|Choice|1973}} Shelley Neiderbach (''[[Library Journal]]'') agreed that Hemmings's "admiring ... historical biography" remained "clear, cool, and evenhanded". {{sfn|Neiderbach|1973}} Sarah Curtis (''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'') wrote in 1972 that Hemmings's account of Neill was "the most lucid, dispassionate yet sympathetic" published. No system, she wrote, has reconciled the needs for individual freedom and societal regulation.{{sfn|Curtis|1972}}

Commenting on the book's survey study, Cowie (''British Journal of Educational Studies'')  wrote that it was hard to ascertain Neill's true pedagogical influence when state schools, which constitute the majority of schools, had a poor response rate. He added that the progressive education topics reported to be most influenced by Neill continued to be controversial in 1973. Cowie asked whether challenges to authoritarian education were replaced by Neill's methods or by chaos.{{sfn|Cowie|1973}} Hopkins (''Comparative Education Review'') said the sociological study was more descriptive of Neill's role than contributive to the evolution of his philosophy. Hopkins wrote that the book functioned best as a biography, and that its philosophy sections were "piecemeal" and "sketchy" rather than "comprehensive and coherent".{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=244}} Indeed, he felt that the study and the philosophical portions were more illuminative of Neill's life than of "any broader picture".{{sfn|Hopkins|1976|p=244}} Robert B. Nordberg (''Best Sellers'') appreciated some of the book's "important points", such that many advocates for educational freedom, in practice, instead seek more insidious techniques for controlling children.{{sfn|Nordberg|1973|p=112}} While Curtis (''The Times Literary Supplement'') felt that the book added little new content, she appreciated the book's detail, such as that Neill's ''A Dominie's Log'' was based in fact, not fiction.{{sfn|Curtis|1972}}

Multiple reviewers highlighted Hemmings's association with the school.{{sfn|Cowie|1973}}{{sfn|Tucker|1972|p=823}}{{sfn|Nordberg|1973|p=112}} Cowie (''British Journal of Educational Studies'') wrote that although Neill did not want disciples, Hemmings "accepts generally the 'Summerhill idea{{'"}} and would fit the role.{{sfn|Cowie|1973}} [[Nicholas Tucker]] (''[[New Statesman]]'') too noted the book as "very one-sided, verging on the uncritical" despite its readability and signs of thorough research.{{sfn|Tucker|1972|p=823}} He said that a balanced account of Summerhill was elusive because of the "sensationalized" press and "rosy" recollections of Neill and his former pupils, similar to the memoirs of "Old Boys' clubs elsewhere".{{sfn|Tucker|1972|p=823}} He wrote, however, that Hemmings's position was understandable when considering the criticism that Summerhill and Neill withstood from "conventional educational wisdom" and "horrified hearsay", which had turned the school into "a type of scholastic folk myth" to set straight. Still, Tucker saw less cause for Summerhill's defense by the time of publication as Neill had wider acceptance. He had become a powerful figure in education and his school a template for the American [[free school movement]].{{sfn|Tucker|1972|p=823}} Cowie wrote that Neill seemed to be enjoying greater acceptance in his later life as Summerhill was "losing its uniqueness as 'that dreadful school{{'"}}.{{sfn|Cowie|1973}} Nordberg (''Best Sellers'') said that while Hemmings has some criticism for Neill and "open education", "he is basically an enthusiast" who wrote a "sympathetic portrayal".{{sfn|Nordberg|1973|p=112}} Even from this sympathetic angle, Nordberg felt that Neill came across as "the child of an overly strict and demanding father who has spent the rest of his life in a rather one-dimensional crusade, more visceral than rational, against authority in all forms."{{sfn|Nordberg|1973|p=112}} Altogether, Nordberg wrote, ''Fifty Years'' succeeds in its "systematic, scholarly look at the Summerhill idea" but fails to provide "a balanced, profound look" at its counterpart: "need for restraint, rationality, and responsibility in the world".{{sfn|Nordberg|1973|p=112}}

Neill himself "liked" ''Fifty Years'' and thought Hemmings had done a "wonderful job" but "wasn't critical enough".{{sfn|Croall|1983a|p=174}} He noted that the work received few reviews compared to his own.{{sfn|Croall|1983a|p=174}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3456">[[File:Knowledge_Magazine_and_Encyclopaedia_Issue_1.png|thumb|right|First issue of Knowledge, 9 January 1961]]
'''''Knowledge''''' was a British weekly educational magazine for children which was assembled in blue binders into an encyclopedia. 

==History and profile==
The magazine was launched by [[Purnell and Sons]] on 9 January 1961, as "Knowledge: the new colour magazine which grows into an encyclopædia" (subsequently "the colour magazine which grows into an encyclopædia") at a price of two shillings per issue (the pre-decimal equivalent of 10p; a later re-issued run was priced as 2/6 or 12½p). Sixteen volumes of twelve issues each were initially planned, but two additional volumes brought the total to eighteen. There was also a four-volume alphabetical topic guide in slightly smaller yellow binders, also assembled from parts inserted into the main magazine.

The majority of the covers of the first 192 issues (volumes 1-16) were the work of illustrator Alessandro Fedini, but the covers of the additional issues 193-216 (volumes 17 and 18) depicted twentieth century events and news headlines.  

''Knowledge'' was a British version of the Italian magazine ''Conoscere'' published by Fratelli Fabri Editori of [[Milan]]. The concept of a British edition had first been pitched to [[Fleetway Publications Ltd]] who turned it down fearing it would damage sales of their own ''[[The Children's Encyclopædia]]'' and ''[[The Children's Newspaper]]''. Following the success of ''Knowledge'', Fleetway brought out ''[[Look and Learn]]'' in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Look and Learn: A History of the Classic Children's Magazine (page 30)|author=Steve Holland|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/history/Look-and-Learn-History.pdf|work=Look and Learn|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Knowledge'' sold 400,000 copies and was edited by John Paget Chancellor (1927-2014), son of Sir [[Christopher Chancellor]], father of actress [[Anna Chancellor]] and brother of journalist [[Alexander Chancellor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11333583/John-Chancellor-obituary.html Obituary of John Chancellor] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 8 Jan 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The advisory editorial board of ''Knowledge'' was [[Christopher N. L. Brooke]] M.A., [[Violet Bonham Carter]] D.B.E, [[Norman Fisher (educationalist) | Norman Fisher]] M.A., [[Walter Hamilton (Master of Magdalene College) | Walter Hamilton]] M.A., [[John Hanbury Angus Sparrow | John Sparrow]] M.A., L. [[Dudley Stamp]] C.B.E. D.Sc., and [[George Paget Thomson|George Thomson]] F.R.S. D.Sc. In later editions John Chancellor became [[editor-in-chief]] with William Armstrong B.A. as editor and Christopher Falkus B.A. (son of [[Hugh Falkus]]) as assistant editor.&lt;ref&gt;Flyleaf of bound volume of ''Knowledge Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine ceased publication in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Description|url=https://www.gumtree.com/p/magazines/-knowledge-encyclopaedia-magazine-published-by-purnell-1962-1966.-complete-bound-set./1179974360|work=Gumtree|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latin honors''' are [[Latin]] phrases used to indicate the level of distinction with which an [[academic degree]] has been earned. This system is primarily used in the [[United States]], many countries of continental Europe, and some Southeastern Asian countries with European colonial history, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, although some institutions use translations of these phrases rather than the Latin originals. The honors distinction should not be confused with the [[honors degree]]s offered in some countries.

Generally, a college's or university's regulations set out definite criteria to be met in order for a student to obtain a given honors distinction. For example, the student might be required to achieve a specific grade point average, to submit an honors thesis for evaluation, to be part of an honors program, or to graduate early. Each university sets its own standards. Since these standards may vary widely it is possible for the same level of Latin honors conferred by different institutions to represent contrasting levels of academic achievement {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}.  Similarly, some institutions may grant equivalent (or additional) non-Latin honors to undergraduates.  The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], for example, has a series of plain English grading honors based on class standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://registrar.wisc.edu/grading_honors.htm | title = Grading Honors | work = [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], Office of the Registrar | publisher = University of Wisconsin System | date = January 7, 2017 | access-date = January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These honors, when they are used, are almost always awarded to [[undergraduate]]s earning their bachelor's, and, with the exception of law school graduates, much more rarely to [[graduate school|graduate]] students receiving their [[master's degree|master's]] or [[doctorate]] degree. The honor is typically indicated on the [[diploma]]. Latin honors are often conferred upon law school students graduating as a [[Juris Doctor]] or J.D., in which case they are generally based upon [[class rank]] or [[grade point average]].

=={{Visible anchor|Types}}==&lt;!-- Other articles link here. --&gt;
Many institutions confer three levels of Latin honors, as follows:
*''[[Wiktionary:cum laude|cum laude]]'', meaning "with praise" or "with honor". In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 25% or 30% of their class. The threshold differs significantly across different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nyu.edu/life/resources-and-services/nyu-studentlink/registration-records-and-graduation/graduation-and-diplomas/graduation-honors.html | title = Graduation Honors | work = NYU | publisher = New York University | date = | quote = Effective with the September 2008 graduating class,... the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distribution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included.

''Cum laude'': the GPA included within the next 15 percent of the previous year's class. | accessdate = January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bu.edu/reg/graduation/latin-honors/ | title = Latin Honors | work = BU, Office of the University Registrar | publisher = [[Boston University]] | quote = Among graduating seniors in each school or college, Latin Honors are awarded to the top 30% of the class as follows: Summa Cum Laude Top 5%, Magna Cum Laude Next 10%, Cum Laude Next 15% | accessdate = January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Wiktionary:magna cum laude|magna cum laude]]'', meaning "with great honor". In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 10% or 15% of their class; this is the highest honor awarded at some institutions. 
*''[[Wiktionary:summa cum laude|summa cum laude]]'', meaning "with highest honor". In North America, this honor is typically awarded to graduates in the top 1–5% of their class.

A rarely used distinction, ''[[Wiktionary:maxima cum laude|maxima cum laude]]'', "with very great honor", is an intermediary honor between the ''magna'' and the ''summa'' honors. It is sometimes used when the ''summa'' honor is reserved only for students with perfect academic records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Honors at Graduation| url = https://www1.up.edu/registrar/students/honors-at-graduation.html | year = 2016 | publisher = [[University of Portland]] | quote = Honors are based on the following formula: within a given college or school, ''summa cum laude'' will be awarded to all students receiving a 4.00 GPA; ''maxima cum laude'' to the next 3%; ''magna cum laude'' to the next 7%; ''cum laude'' to the next 10%. | accessdate = January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lasalle.edu/catalog/new.php?programid=179&amp;programentryid=884 | title = Honors | work = La Salle University Course Catalog | publisher = [[La Salle University]] | quote =  The bachelor’s degree with honors is conferred on a student who has completed course requirements at the University with a cumulative academic index not lower than 3.40 and who has not incurred any academic censure.

The candidate who has earned an index between 3.60 and 3.79 is graduated with the distinction ''Magna Cum Laude''. The candidate who has earned an index of 3.80 or better is graduated with the distinction ''Maxima Cum Laude''.| accessdate = January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further rarely used distinction is that of ''Egregia Cum Laude'' which means "with outstanding honor" and is typically reserved for either students achieving summa cum laude honors in a particularly difficult subject area or recipients of a non-standard Bachelor's degree &lt;ref&gt;https://www.csbsju.edu/academics/2011-2012-catalog/academic-policies-and-regulations/graduation/graduation-honors&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use around the world==
For undergraduate degrees, Latin honors are used in only a few countries such as the [[Education in the United States|United States]], [[Education in Israel|Israel]], [[Education in Indonesia|Indonesia]], the [[Education in the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], the [[Education in the Philippines|Philippines]] and [[Education in Canada|Canada]]. Most countries use a different scheme, such as the [[British undergraduate degree classification]] (usually used in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries) which is more widely used with varying criteria and nomenclature depending on country, including [[Tertiary education in Australia|Australia]], [[Education in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]], [[Education in Barbados|Barbados]], [[Education in Colombia|Colombia]], [[Education in Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Higher education in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Education in India|India]], [[Education in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Education in Jamaica|Jamaica]], [[Education in Kenya|Kenya]], [[Education in New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Education in Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[Education in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Education in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Education in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], [[Education in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Education in Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad and Tobago]], the [[Education in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Education in Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]] and many other countries. [[Malta]] shows the Latin honors on the degree certificates, but the UK model is shown on the transcript.

In [[Education in Austria|Austria]], the only Latin honor in use is ''[[sub auspiciis Praesidentis]] rei publicae'' (''under the auspices of the president of the republic'') for doctoral degrees. Candidates must have consistently excellent grades throughout high school and university, making it very difficult to attain: only about 20 out of a total of 2,500 doctoral graduates per year (i.e. 0.8%) achieve a ''sub auspiciis'' degree.

In [[Education in Belgium|Belgium]], the university degree awarded is limited to:

* Satisfaction ("satisfaction" in French, "op voldoende wijze" in Dutch)
* ''cum laude'' ("avec distinction" in French, "met onderscheiding" in Dutch)
* ''magna cum laude'' ("avec grande distinction" in French, "met grote onderscheiding" in Dutch)
* ''summa cum laude'' ("avec la plus grande distinction" in French, "met grootste onderscheiding" in Dutch)

In [[Education in Brazil|Brazil]], the [[Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica]] (ITA—Aeronautical Institute of Technology) awards the ''cum laude'' honor for graduates with every individual grade above 8.5 (out of 10.0), the ''magna cum laude'' honor for graduates with average grade above 8.5 and more than 50% of individual grades above 9.5, and the ''summa cum laude'' honor for graduates with average grade above 9.5. As of 2009, only 22 graduates have received the ''summa cum laude'' honor at ITA. The [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]] awards the ''cum laude'' honor for graduates with average grade from 8.0 to 8.9, the ''magna cum laude'' honor for graduates with average grade from 9.0 to 9.4, and the ''summa cum laude'' honor for graduates with average grade from 9.5 to 10.0. The [[Federal University of Ceará]] awards the ''magna cum laude'' honor for undergraduates who have never failed a course, achieved an average grade from 8.5 (out of 10.0) and have received a fellowship of both ''Academic Extension'' and ''Teaching Initiation''.

In [[Estonia]], up until 2010 both ''summa cum laude'' and ''cum laude'' were used. ''Summa cum laude'' was awarded only for very exceptional work. Since 1 September 2010, only ''cum laude'' is used. It is awarded to bachelors, masters and integrated studies graduates. Occasionally the word ''kiitusega'', which means "with praise", is substituted for the usual ''cum laude''. To receive ''cum laude'' one must achieve 4.60 GPA (out of 5) and receive the highest grade (A - 5.00) for the thesis or the final examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/13230393 | title = Ühtne hindamissüsteem kõrgharidustasemel, koos diplomi kiitusega (cum laude) andmise tingimustega | language = Estonian | trans-title = A unified evaluation system of higher education: conditions for granting a diploma with honors (cum laude) | publisher = Minister of Education and Science | date = September 1, 2010 | accessdate = January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Education in Finland|Finnish]] [[Matriculation Examination]]s at the end of [[lukio]] uses the grades of:
''improbatur'' (I, failing; "not accepted"), ''approbatur'' (A; "accepted") ''lubenter approbatur'' (B; "willingly accepted"), ''cum laude approbatur'' (C; "accepted with praise"), ''magna cum laude approbatur'' (M; "accepted with great praise"), ''eximia cum laude approbatur'' (E; "accepted with excellent praise") and ''[[laudatur]]'' (L; "praised"). They are roughly equivalent to Finnish school grades ranging from 4 to 10. Some Finnish universities, when grading master's theses and doctoral dissertations, use the same scale with the additional grade of ''non sine laude approbatur'' (N; "accepted not without praise") between ''lubenter'' and ''cum laude''; technical universities use a numerical scale (1-5) instead.
{{see also|academic grading in Finland}}

In [[Education in France|France]], usually the French honors ''très honorable avec félicitations du jury'', ''très honorable'' and ''honorable'' are used. However some [[Grande école|Grandes Écoles]], like the [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris]], [[HEC Paris]], use the Latin and English titles ''"summa cum laude" / "graduated with highest honors"'' for the top 2% and ''"cum laude" / "graduated with honors"'' for the next 5% of a year. Since 2016, honorifics ceased to be use for the completion of a [[PhD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Arrêté du 25 mai 2016 fixant le cadre national de la formation et les modalités conduisant à la délivrance du diplôme national de doctorat|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000032587086|accessdate=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Education in Germany|Germany]], the range of degrees is: ''rite'' ("duly" conferred, that is, the requirements are fulfilled), ''cum laude'' (with honors), ''magna cum laude'' (with great honors), and ''summa cum laude'' (with highest honors). These degrees are mostly used when a doctorate is conferred, not for diplomas, bachelor's or master's degrees, for which numerical grades between 1.0 ("very good") and 4.0 ("pass"), and 5.0 ("fail"), are given.

In [[Education in Hungary|Hungary]], the range of degrees&amp;nbsp;— similar to the German system&amp;nbsp;— is: ''rite'' ("duly" conferred, that is, the requirements are fulfilled), ''cum laude'' (with honors), ''summa cum laude'' (with highest honors). These degrees are used in university diplomas and in certain fields of sciences (medical, legal and a very few others) only. The grades of degrees are dependent on the received average points from final exams and from average points from the university studies.

In [[Education in Italy|Italy]], the ''cum laude'' notation (''"con lode"'' being the equivalent in [[Italian language|Italian]]) is used as an increasing level of the highest grade for both exams (30/30) and degrees (110/110), in all its levels; sometimes passing an exam cum laude (30 e lode) has only an honorific meaning, but sometimes it influences the average grade and can be useful to the student so honored.
In Italy "''110 e lode''" (at institutions using a 110-point system) is the highest rank that can be achieved during the academic studies, although many years ago there were some other notations (that were given only to those who had attained the "lode"). These include   : ''bacio e abbraccio accademico'' ("academic kiss and embrace") ''menzione d'onore'' ("honor mention") and ''dignità di stampa'' ("dignity of printing"), and were given based on various University-specific requirements, but without a legal value.

In [[Malta]], for Bachelor Honours degrees ''Summa Cum Laude'' refers to First Class Honours, ''Magna Cum Laude'' refers to Second Class Honours (Upper Division), ''Cum Laude'' refers to Second Class Honours (Lower Division) whilst ''Bene Probatus'' refers to Third Class Honours. Professional degrees lasting longer than the standard 3 years such as the 5 year Bachelor of Pharmacy are awarded ''Egregia Cum Laude''. Postgraduate Diplomas and Master’s degrees may be awarded as Pass with Distinction (Summa Cum Laude), Pass with Merit (Magna Cum Laude) or Pass (Bene Probatus).

In [[Education in the Netherlands|the Netherlands]], both for bachelor's and master's programs, only one class of honors is used: ''cum laude'' (with honor). Typically it is reserved to mark exceptional achievement. It depends on an absolute minimal grade point average. Sometimes it is lost, despite a high average mark, when the student gets a mark of 6 or lower for one of the many exams (on a scale of 1–10, where 10 is the highest). Generally, less than 2% receive the ''cum laude'' distinction. It is also possible to receive a PhD degree ''cum laude'', although this honor is even rarer than for master's graduates. In view of the difficulty and subjectivity of determining this, some universities and fields of study very seldom award doctorates ''cum laude''. At Dutch University Colleges, ''cum laude'', ''magna cum laude'' and, exceptionally, ''summa cum laude'' may be used.

[[Education in the Philippines|In the Philippines]], Junior High School Students under the new [[K-12|K-12 Curriculum]] an honor system using Filipino translations of the Latin original. Students who achieve a final grade average of 90-94 are awarded the title "May Karangalan" ("cum laude" in Latin or "with honors") and will receive a bronze medal with the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|DepEd]] seal.Those who have a final grade average of 95-97 receive the title of "May Mataas na Karangalan" ("magna cum laude" or "with high honors") and a silver medal with the same seal. Students with a final grade average of 98-100 shall be awarded the title of "May Pinakamataas na Karangalan" ("summa cum laude" or "with highest honors") and a gold medal with the same specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deped.gov.ph/sites/default/files/order/2016/DO_s2016_036.pdf |title=Policy Guidelines on Awards and Recognition for the K to 12 Basic Education Program |accessdate=January 1, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402165847/http://www.deped.gov.ph/sites/default/files/order/2016/DO_s2016_036.pdf |work=[[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] |publisher=[[Philippines]] |archivedate=April 2, 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Education in Russia|Russia]], the honor system is based on the grade point averages. At least 4.75 out of 5.0 points are required for the cum laude degree ("с отличием" ("s otlichiem") in Russian or "with excellence").&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawrussia.ru/texts/legal_913/doc91a947x255.htm Russian Education Law]&amp;nbsp;— В соответствии с Законом Российской Федерации «Об образовании» № 12-ФЗ, 13 January 1996 and типовым «Положением об итоговой аттестации выпускников высших учебных заведений», утвержденным приказом Минобразования России, 25 March 2003 № 1155.&lt;/ref&gt; The graduate has to receive a perfect grade on all final examinations. Usually less than 2% of all graduating students accomplish this (depending on the university and year). In military schools, a "red diploma" may be accompanied by a gold medal ("summa cum laude") for outstanding performance. Russian high schools also award a gold medal to the student who achieves a perfect score in all final examinations and in all other subjects not requiring a final exam. A silver medal is awarded to high school students who have one or two grades of 4 ("хорошо" in Russian or "good", being second highest grade) on their final exams or other subjects as listed in the high school diploma ("attestat o (polnom) srednem obrazovanii").

In [[Education in Singapore|Singapore]], the Latin honors, ''cum laude'', ''magna cum laude'' and ''summa cum laude'' are used by [[Singapore Management University]]. Graduates from Singapore Management University have to achieve GPAs of 3.4, 3.6 and 3.8 out of 4.0 respectively and without any exceptions, in order to qualify for the Latin honors.

In [[Higher education in Spain|Spain]], the Latin honors ''cum laude'' is used for PhD degrees only,  and is awarded after a secret vote of the jury members, using envelopes that must be opened in a separate session, and requiring unanimity. Around 82% PhD candidates received ''cum laude'' in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Education |url= https://www.mecd.gob.es/servicios-al-ciudadano-mecd/dms/mecd/servicios-al-ciudadano-mecd/estadisticas/educacion/universitaria/estadisticas/tesis-doctorales/ano-2016/Principales-resultados-Estadistica-de-tesis-2016.pdf |title=Estafistica de Tesis 2016 |website=mecd.gob.es |date= |accessdate=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Education in Switzerland|Switzerland]], the degrees ''rite'', ''cum laude'', ''magna cum laude'', ''insigni cum laude'' and ''summa cum laude'' are used, but the exact GPA corresponding to each varies by institution.

In the [[Education in the UK|UK]] the Latin ''cum laude'' is used in Latin versions of honors degrees by a few universities (e.g. [[University of Edinburgh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.registry.ed.ac.uk/Graduations/Latin.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615011549/http://www.registry.ed.ac.uk/Graduations/Latin.htm |archive-date=June 15, 2007 |title=Latin Versions of Degree Parchments | work = The University of Edinburgh Registry | publisher = [[University of Edinburgh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to denote a Bachelor '''with Honours''' degree, but the further classification is stated as in English, e.g. ''Primi Ordinis'' for First Class etc.

In [[Education in Ukraine|Ukraine]], the university education honor system is based on by-law # 161 (02.06.1993) of The Ministry of Education of Ukraine (3.12.3.5). In order for a student to graduate a university with a diploma with honors (''cum laude''), students have to receive mark "5" (excellent) at least on 75% of courses, receive mark 4 (good) at max 25% of courses, and pass the state exams only with mark "5" (excellent). Also, students are expected to have participated in research projects with visible results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/z0173-93?nreg=z0173-93&amp;find=1&amp;text=%E7+%E2i%E4%E7%ED%E0%EA%EE%FE&amp;x=8&amp;y=8 |title=Про затвердження Положення про організацію навчальног... &amp;#124; від 02.06.1993 № 161 (Сторінка 1 з 2) |website=Zakon4.rada.gov.ua |date= |accessdate=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of usage in the United States==
In 1869, [[Harvard College]] became the first college in the United States to award final honors to its graduates. From 1872 to 1879, ''cum laude'' and ''summa cum laude'' were the two Latin honors awarded to graduates. Beginning in 1880, ''magna cum laude'' was also awarded:

{{quote|The Faculty then prepared regulations for recommending candidates for the Bachelor's degree, either for an ordinary degree or for a degree with distinction; the grades of distinction being ''summa cum laude'', ''magna cum laude'', and ''cum laude''. The degree ''summa cum laude'' is for those who have attained ninety percent on the general scale, or have received Highest Honors in any department, and carries with it the assignment of an oration on the list of Commencement parts; the degree ''magna cum laude'' is for those who have attained eighty percent on the general scale, or have received Honors in any department, and carries with it the assignment of a dissertation; and the degree ''cum laude'' is to be given to those who attain seventy-five percent on the general scale, and to those who receive Honorable Mention in any study together with sixty-five percent on the general scale, or seventy percent on the last three years, or seventy-five percent on the last two.|Annual Reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College, 1877–78}}

In his 1895 history of [[Amherst College]], college historian [[William Seymour Tyler]] traced Amherst's system of Latin honors to 1881, and attributed it to Amherst College President [[Julius Hawley Seelye]]:

{{quote|&lt;p&gt;Instead of attempting to fix the rank of every individual student by minute divisions on a scale of a hundred as formerly, five grades of scholarship were established and degrees were conferred upon the graduating classes according to their grades. If a student was found to be in the first or lowest grade, he was not considered as a candidate for a degree, though he might receive a certificate stating the facts in regard to his standing; if he appeared in the second grade the degree of A.B. was conferred upon him ''rite;'' if in the third, ''cum laude''; if in the fourth, ''magna cum laude''; while if he reached the fifth grade he received the degree ''summa cum laude''. The advantages of this course, as stated to the trustees by the president, are that it properly discriminates between those who, though passing over the same course of study, have done it with great differences of merit and of scholarship, and that it furnishes a healthy incentive to the best work without exciting an excessive spirit of emulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system of administration, of which the above is a part, is so original and peculiar that it is known as the Amherst System.&lt;/p&gt;|''A History of Amherst College During the Administrations of Its First Five Presidents, From 1821 To 1891''&lt;ref name=Amherst&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = http://www3.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/amherst/history/1894tyler-ws/chapter11/menu.html | chapter = 11: The Burning of Walker Hall - The Buildings Erected During the Administration - The "Amherst System" - Amherst College Reaches Its Highest Prosperity - Resignation of President Seelye | title =A History of Amherst College During the Administrations of Its First Five Presidents, From 1821 To 1891 | first = William S. | last = Tyler | author-link = William Seymour Tyler| location = New York | publisher = Frederick H.

'''Margaret "Maggie" Black''' (March 31, 1930 – May 11, 2015) was a [[ballet]] teacher who taught in New York City during the 1970s and 1980s.   She coached dancers such as [[Martine Van Hamel]], [[Kevin McKenzie (dancer)|Kevin McKenzie]], [[Natalia Makarova]] and [[Gelsey Kirkland]].   She developed a ballet technique based on anatomy.  She stressed moving from a neutral spinal and pelvic alignment with weight evenly distributed throughout each foot.  She amassed a large following of both ballet and modern dancers.  Eventually she split her class into two, one for modern dancers and one for ballet dancers. Choreographers such as [[William Forsythe (choreographer)|William Forsythe]] and [[Ohad Naharin]] attended her class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zeller | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1080/01472520802690283 | title = Teaching through Time: Tracing Ballet's Pedagogical Lineage in the Work of Maggie Black | journal = Dance Chronicle | volume = 32 | pages = 57–88 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black was born in Rhode Island in 1930, and moved to New York City at the age of 16 to study dance.&lt;ref name=DanceTeacher/&gt;   She danced with Cleveland Civic Ballet for a season and then moved to London where she danced with the London Theatre Ballet and Ballet Rambert.&lt;ref name=DanceTeacher/&gt;   In London she studied with Audry de Vos.  After two years in the UK, she returned to New York and danced with [[American Ballet Theatre]] for a year.  At the invitation of [[Alicia Alonso]], she danced with [[National Ballet of Cuba]] for a year before returning to New York City to join the Metropolitan Opera Ballet.  There she worked with [[Antony Tudor]] who later invited her to teach at [[Juilliard]].

After working with Tudor for 7 years, Black returned to London.  She spent three years reworking her own technique.  She spent multiple hours a day in front of a mirror developing her theory of physical alignment that became the foundation for her teaching.  To Black alignment is central to ballet technique and artistry.  Moving from a natural alignment allows for freedom from tension and clarity of line and movement quality.

Black retired in 1995.&lt;ref name=DanceTeacher&gt;{{cite news |last=Straus |first=Rachel |title=Black Magic |url=http://www.dance-teacher.com/2012/04/black-magic/ |accessdate=February 6, 2013 |newspaper=Dance Teacher magazine |date=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 11, 2015, Black died in her [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], New York home from, according to Black's friend Gary Chryst, [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/arts/dance/maggie-black-esteemed-ballet-and-modern-dance-teacher-dies-at-85.html|title=Maggie Black, Esteemed Ballet and Modern Dance Teacher, Dies at 85|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=May 21, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her acting career, Ingber portrayed Annie, wife of Anthony Tortelli and daughter-in-law of his mother [[Carla Tortelli|Carla]], in the television sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'' and its short-lived spin-off ''[[The Tortellis]]'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/22/arts/tv-reviews-nbc-presents-the-tortellis-a-cheers-spinoff.html|title=TV Reviews: NBC Presents ''The Tortellis'', a ''Cheers'' spinoff|date=January 22, 1987|author=Corry, John|accessdate=August 13, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She played Robin, Baby's "witless cousin", in the short-lived [[Dirty Dancing (1988 TV series)|television series adaptation]] of the film ''[[Dirty Dancing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Kathryn |date=October 31, 1988 |title=''Dirty Dancing'' Needs More Dancing |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5dkrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UWQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mandy%20ingber%20dirty%20dancing&amp;pg=1311%2C5782530 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Kentucky New Era]] |location=[[Hopkinsville, Kentucky]] |page=6B |accessdate=December 21, 2014 |via=''[[Google News Archive]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5639">The '''George J. Mitchell Scholarship''' is a [[Scholarship|fellowship]] awarded annually by the U.S.-Ireland Alliance funding [[graduate school|graduate]] study in [[Ireland]]. Although relatively young—the first class of scholars began their studies in 2000—the Mitchell Scholarship has quickly established itself as one of the most selective fellowships in the United States. The scholarship is often considered one of the three primary and most competitive international fellowships for American students, alongside the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and [[Marshall Scholarship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sara|first=Ivry|title=Other Roads|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/education/other-roads.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, approximately 350 young Americans apply for the 12 scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vargo|first=Trina|title=Class of 2014 Mitchell Scholars selected|url=http://www.us-irelandalliance.org/content/393/en/Scholarships/Program%20News/Class%20of%202014%20Mitchell%20Scholars%20selected.html|publisher=US-Ireland Alliance|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The George J. Mitchell Scholarship is organized under the auspices of the US-Ireland Alliance, a non-profit non-partisan organization based in Arlington, VA. The program began in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vargo|first=Trina|title=The Irish, Here and There; For Irish Americans, Peace Means Change|url=http://www.us-irelandalliance.org/content/94/en/Leadership/Opinions/Trina%20Vargo%20On%20The%20Creation%20Of%20The%20US-Ireland%20Alliance%20(Washington%20Post).html|accessdate=11 December 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 19, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by US-Ireland Alliance president [[Trina Vargo]] with early support from the Irish and British Governments. Over the last decade, the program has been largely funded by the [[United States Department of State]], with additional support from the [[Northern Ireland Government]], [[Becton Dickinson]], and [[Cross Atlantic Capital Partners]]. In 2010, the [[Oireachtas|Irish Parliament]] passed legislation whereby it will match any contributions, up to 20 million euros, to an endowment for the Scholarship program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kay|first=Sean|title=Celtic Revival?  The Rise, Fall, and Renewal of Global Ireland|year=2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-1442211094|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mitchell Scholarship award includes tuition, housing, airfare, a cash stipend, and other benefits such as a travel [[bursary]] to encourage travel both in and outside Ireland and Northern Ireland.  In recent years, Mitchell Scholars have used their travel bursary to explore countries as diverse as [[Oman]], [[Cambodia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Azerbaijan]].

==Scholarship purpose==
The Mitchell Scholars Program, named to honor former U.S. Senator [[George J. Mitchell]]'s pivotal contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process, is designed to introduce and connect future American leaders to the island of Ireland and recognize and foster intellectual achievement, leadership, and a commitment to community and public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kay|first=Sean|title=Celtic Revival?  The Rise, Fall, and Renewal of Global Ireland|year=2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-1442211094|pages=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alumni ==
Alumni of the Mitchell Scholarship program have pursued careers in consulting, law, academia, politics, and journalism. Notable alumni include Arsalan Suleman, the acting U.S. Special Envoy to the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organization of Islamic Cooperation]]; Matt Haney, president of the [[San Francisco Board of Education]]; [[Ty McCormick]], the Africa editor of [[Foreign Policy]] magazine; and [[Jimmy Soni]], the former managing editor of the [[Huffington Post]].

==Placement==
Mitchell Scholars are placed at universities in both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], including [[Trinity College, Dublin]], [[University College Cork - National University of Ireland, Cork|University College Cork]], [[University of Limerick]], [[National University of Ireland, Galway]], [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth]], [[University College Dublin - National University of Ireland, Dublin|University College Dublin]], [[Dublin City University]], [[University of Ulster]] and [[Queen's University of Belfast|Queen's University Belfast]].

==Controversy==
In 2012, the Department of State attempted to eliminate funding for the program but with the support of several members of the [[United States Congress]]; university presidents and professors; the public, in the form of a petition; and the Irish and Northern Ireland Governments, the decision was reversed for fiscal year 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Susan|title=Scholarship Program For Future Leaders Gets New Lease On Life|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2012/11/19/scholarship-program-for-future-leaders-gets-new-lease-on-life/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5376">'''The Molesworth Institute''' supports creative research and production in the fields of absurdist informatics, disjunctive librarianship, and word play. It is one of the major sources of [[library]] [[humor]], and a repository for various kinds of librariana. Its Archives of Library Humor is the most extensive of its kind. The Institute's collection of over 25,000 library [[postcard]]s, library ephemera, commemorative and souvenir [[Porcelain|china]], medals, miniatures, and stereographs, is housed in the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Norman D. Stevens Collection of Library Architecture|url=http://www.libraryhistorybuff.org/stevens.htm|publisher=The Library History Buff|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1956, The Molesworth Institute has been defined by vocational shenanigans, invented histories, and a refusal to accept definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindskoog|first=Kathryn|title=The C.S. Lewis Foundation for Truth in Publishing|journal=Discovery Institute|date=September 1, 1996|issue=70|url=http://www.discovery.org/a/1006|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded by Francis A. T. Johns and [[Norman D. Stevens]], Director Emeritus. Katie Herzog was appointed Director in April, 2011, and the Institute is currently based in the [[Glassell Park]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. Herzog represented the Molesworth Institute at the first [http://www.cyclingforlibraries.org/ Cycling for Libraries] "unconference" from Copenhagen to Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herzog|first=Katie|title=Library Aesthetics in an Information Age|url=http://www.cyclingforlibraries.org/2011/05/23/katies-homework-library-aesthetics-in-an-information-age/|publisher=Cycling for Libraries|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the first article, "The Molesworth Institute", appeared in the ''[[American Library Association|ALA]] Bulletin'' (57:756-7, 1963), over 50 articles describing the results of specialized research carried out by the staff of the Institute have appeared in all of the major American professional library journals, as well as in library journals in [[Brazil]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], and [[Sweden]]. Its most recent article, "The First Fully Electronic Library", appears in the January 2006 issue of ''College &amp; Research Libraries'' and variant versions have been published in [[France]], Italy, and Sweden. In addition to the research staff, there are now 88 [[Fellow]]s of the Molesworth Institute who assist in the furtherance of the organization's work. In 2012 Catherine Lord was appointed a Molesworth Institute Fellow for her installation at the [[ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives|One Archive]] titled ''To Whom It May Concern''. 

Other significant collections include a file of prominent individuals who worked in libraries, a file of more than 1,000 [[quotation]]s relating to librarians and libraries, a collection of more than 1,000 postcards depicting books and reading, a large collection of children's books dealing with books, reading, librarians, and libraries, and a collection of several hundred objects in the shape of books. The children's books are now part of the [http://nclc.uconn.edu/ Northeast Children's Literature Collection (NCLC)] in the [[Thomas J. Dodd]] Research Center at the [[University of Connecticut]] in [[Storrs, Connecticut]]. The other collections, along with the Archives of the Institute, will eventually be housed in the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center as well.

== The Journal of Rejected Research ==
''The Molesworth institute Journal of Rejected Research'' is an experimental publication falling under the category of disjunctive librarianship and engaging a wide range of approaches to the idea of the [[Scientific journal|journal]] as a conceptual platform for exchange. All submissions must have been rejected at some point in time. Content of Volume One Issue One was rejected by the Iowa Prison Industries Graphic Arts Department. Content of Volume One Issue Two was collected via open call, through a popup publishing platform in the [http://quintgallery.com/ Quint Gallery] restroom in La Jolla, California, from April 21 through July 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utsandiego.com/weblogs/shawnee-barton/2012/apr/19/katie-herzog-in-the-bathroom-at-quint/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nao''' (now pronounced ''now'') is an autonomous, programmable [[humanoid robot]] developed by Aldebaran Robotics, a French [[robotics]] company headquartered in [[Paris]], which was acquired by [[SoftBank Group]] in 2015 and rebranded as [[SoftBank Robotics]]. The robot's development began with the launch of Project Nao in 2004. On 15 August 2007, Nao replaced [[Sony]]'s robot dog [[Aibo]] as the robot used in the [[RoboCup]] [[RoboCup Standard Platform League|Standard Platform League (SPL)]], an international robot [[soccer]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2007/08/16/nao-robot-replaces-aibo-in-robocup-standard-platform-league/ "Nao robot replaces AIBO in RoboCup Standard Platform League"].

[[BBC]]. 25 October 2010. Retrieved 4 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several versions of the robot have been released since 2008. The Nao Academics Edition was developed for universities and laboratories for research and education purposes. It was released to institutions in 2008, and was made publicly available by 2011. Various upgrades to the Nao platform have since been released, including the 2011 Nao Next Gen and the 2014 Nao Evolution.&lt;ref name=NAONEXTG/&gt;&lt;ref name=NaoEv/&gt;

Nao robots have been used for research and education purposes in numerous academic institutions worldwide. As of 2015, over 5,000 Nao units are in use in more than 50 countries.&lt;ref name=NaoEv/&gt;

==Development history==
Aldebaran Robotics was established in 2005 by Bruno Maisonnier, who had previously begun developing the robot under "Project Nao" in 2004.&lt;ref name=NaoEv/&gt; Six prototypes of Nao were designed between 2005 and 2007.

By the end of 2014, over 5,000 Nao robots were in use with educational and research institutions in 70 countries.&lt;ref name=NaoEv/&gt; In 2015, [[Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group]] began trialling Nao robots for [[customer service]] use in its Japanese bank branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/04/japanese-bank-introduces-robot-workers-to-deal-with-customers-in-branches|title=Japanese bank introduces robot workers to deal with customers in branches|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 February 2015|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, Nao robots were shown to demonstrate a basic form of self-awareness in a philosophical experiment at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in New York, in which three robots were set up, muting two of them; they were then told that two of them had been given a "dumbing pill", and asked to figure out which of them hadn't. After initially replying he didn't know, the non-muted robot was able to figure out he hadn't been given the dumbing pill after hearing the sound of his own voice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popsci.com/polite-robots-show-glimmer-self-awareness "Polite robots show glimmer of self-awareness"]. ''[[Popular Science]]''. 16 July 2015. Retrieved 23 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, the [[French Institute of Health and Medical Research]] used Nao robots to test a system of robotic "autobiographical memory" designed to help train [[International Space Station]] crews and assist elderly patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/autobiographical-memory-robots-knowledge-iss/39312/|title='Autobiographical memory' lets robots act as knowledge go-betweens for ISS crews|publisher=Gizmag.com|date=8 September 2015|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nao is available as a research robot for schools, colleges and universities to teach programming and conduct research into human-robot interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/solutions/education-research|title=For education &amp; research|website=SoftBank Robotics|access-date=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, RobotLAB released an online learning platform for schools that enhance the use of NAO for STEM, Coding and Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/engage-k12-is-the-only-learning-platform-that-supports-the-new-robot-from-softbank-robotics-1027433898|title=Launch of Engage! K12|website=Markets Insider|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The various versions of the Nao robotics platform feature either 14, 21 or 25 [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] (DoF). A specialised model with 21 DoF and no actuated hands was created for the Robocup competition. All Nao Academics versions feature an [[inertial measurement unit]] with [[accelerometer]], gyrometer and four [[ultrasonic sensor]]s that provide Nao with stability and positioning within space. The legged versions included eight [[force-sensing resistor]]s and two bumpers. The most recent version of the robot, the 2014 Nao Evolution, features stronger metallic joints, improved grip and an enhanced sound source location system that utilises four directional microphones.&lt;ref name=NaoEv/&gt;

===Software===
The Nao robot is controlled by a specialised [[Linux]]-based [[operating system]], dubbed NAOqi.&lt;ref name=NaoEv/&gt; The OS powers the robot's multimedia system, which includes four microphones (for voice recognition and sound localization), two speakers (for multilingual [[text-to-speech]] synthesis) and two HD cameras (for [[machine vision|computer vision]], including facial and shape recognition). The robot also comes with a software suite that includes a graphical programming tool dubbed Choregraphe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/home_nao.html Choregraphe User Guide]. Aldebaran Robotics. Retrieved 1 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; a simulation software package and a [[software developer's kit]]. Nao is furthermore compatible with the [[Microsoft Robotics Studio]], [[Webots|Cyberbotics Webots]], and the Gostai [[URBI]] Studio.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120110202127/http://www.aldebaran-robotics.com/en/Discover-NAO/nao-datasheet-h25.html "NAO NEXT Gen H25 Datasheet"].

{{Music education|usnat}}
The '''National Association for Music Education''' ('''NAfME''') is an organization of American music educators dedicated to advancing and preserving [[music education]] as part of the core curriculum of schools in the [[United States]].  Founded in 1907 as the '''Music Supervisors National Conference''' ('''MSNC'''), the organization was known from 1934 to 1998 as the '''Music Educators National Conference''' (origin of the '''MENC''' acronym).  From 1998 to 2011 it was known as "MENC: The National Association for Music Education."  On September 1, 2011, the organization changed its acronym from MENC to NAfME.&lt;ref name=Release&gt;{{cite web|title= Press Release: Building on the Past to Shape the Future of Music Education|url=http://www.nafme.org/news/view/press-release-building-on-the-past-to-shape-the-future-of-music-education/|year=2011|work=NAfME official website|publisher=NAfME|accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, Professor Glenn Nierman was elected president-elect of NAfME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= New NAfME President Seeks to Restore Trust|url=http://sociomusicology.blogspot.com/2012/03/new-nafme-president-seeks-to-restore.html|year=2012|work=Sociomusicology blog|publisher=David Hebert|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, 2012, the organization's name legally became National Association for Music Education, using the acronym "NAfME". It has more than 130,000 members, and NAfME's headquarters are located in [[Reston, Virginia|Reston]], [[Virginia]].

== State affiliates ==
NAfME functions regionally through more than fifty state (or state-level) affiliates.  These federated state associations include organizations representing each of the fifty [[United States|U.S.]] states; the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]; and a single affiliate for [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NAfME Federated State Associations|url=http://musiced.nafme.org/about/nafme-federated-state-associations/|year=2012|work=NAfME official website|publisher=NAfME|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
As of May 11, 2016, NAfME staff members are led by Mike Blakeslee. Staff were previously led by Michael A. Butera from 2010-2016, and by John J. Mahlmann, who retired in early 2010. There are also leaders for the All-Eastern Division.

==History==
Hamlin Cogswell (1852-1922) founded the Music Supervisors National Conference in 1907. While a small number of women served as president of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name=Slideshare&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers|title=A Historical View of Women in Music Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction.&lt;ref name=Slideshare/&gt; More men tend to be hired for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=Slideshare/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name=Slideshare/&gt;

The '''National Institute of Arts, Kinshasa''' ('''l'Institut National des Arts''' or INA) is a higher educational institution that provides training to performance artists in [[Kinshasa]], Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The INA was established on 1 December 1967, at first called the National Conservatory of Music and Dramatic Arts (Conservatoire National de Musique et d’Arts Dramatiques).  The objective was to discover national cultural identities through intangible heritages such as music.&lt;ref name=45thann/&gt;

In September 2009 it was reported that the building that housed the Institute had been sold to a South African company.
The Ministry of Higher Education was negotiating with the new owners to let the institute remain in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In February 2012 the minister of Higher Education and Universities, [[Léonard Mashako Mamba]], said the government would give the Institute part of the site of the Institute of Agricultural Technology in [[Mombele]].  The government would build a campus with auditoriums, houses, a sports complex and administrative offices.&lt;ref name=45thann/&gt;

Until recently the Director General was the graphic artist and painter [[Lema Kusa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As of March 2012 the Director General was Yoka Lye Mudaba. 
He was responsible for arranging for students of the institute to perform the anthem for the 14th summit of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] in Kinshasa that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The 45th anniversary celebrations were held at "The Zoo" cultural center in Kinshasa in February 2012. 
The planned festivities included conferences, exhibitions, music and choreography.&lt;ref name=45thann/&gt;

The '''National School Chaplaincy Programme''' ('''NSCP'''), between 2011 and 2014 known as the '''National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Programme''', is an [[Australian federal government]] programme which funds [[chaplain]]s in [[Australia]]n primary and secondary schools. The chaplains are to provide "support and guidance about ethics, values, relationships and spirituality",&lt;ref name="det"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.education.gov.au/national-school-chaplaincy-programme|title=National School Chaplaincy Programme|publisher=Australian Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on [[pastoral care]], not [[religious instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Karp |first1=Paul |title=School chaplains agency faces tax challenge over $33m in donations |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/23/school-chaplains-agency-faces-tax-challenge-over-33m-in-donations |work=Guardian Australia |date=22 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grants are $20,000 a year for schools and $24,000 for schools in remote areas.&lt;ref name=SMHAug2014/&gt;

==History==
In October 2006, the [[Howard Government]] established NSCP, at an expected cost of $90 million, to provide $20,000 grants for schools to employ chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;The Age, 29 October 2006: [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/school-chaplain-plan-unveiled/2006/10/29/1162056858561.html School chaplain plan unveiled]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SMH, 31 October 2006: [http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/chaplain-program-is-no-crusade-pm/2006/10/30/1162056926643.html Chaplain program is no crusade: PM]&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, chaplains in state schools have, controversially, been funded by the federal government since 2007, as well as local communities. Chaplaincy services are provided by religious service companies which are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]], though non-denominational within Christianity, including Scripture Union Queensland, Genr8 Ministries in NSW and [[Council for Christian Education in Schools|Access Ministries]]. As of 2008, there were 2,850 chaplains employed under NSCP.&lt;ref&gt;The Australian, 8 December 2008: [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/school-chaplains-worked-miracles/story-e6frg6nf-1111118239078 School chaplains 'worked miracles']&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 7 September 2011, [[Peter Garrett]], Education Minister in the [[Gillard Government]], announced a number of changes in NSCP. New chaplains were to be required to have a "[[Certificate IV]] in Youth Work, Pastoral Care or an equivalent qualification", while previously no formal qualifications were required.&lt;ref name=new/&gt; The changes also offered schools the option to employ, instead of "a religious support worker" (chaplain), a "secular student well-being officer", following concerns over the appropriateness of having a religious worker in a public school.&lt;ref name=appropriate&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/chaplaincy-change-a-crisis-of-faith/2285003.aspx |title=Chaplaincy change a crisis of faith |first=Breanna |last=Tucker |work=[[Canberra Times]] |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously schools were only able to hire a secular welfare worker under the programme if they could demonstrate that their efforts to find an ordained chaplain had failed.&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/new-choice-for-school-chaplaincy-program-20110907-1jxur.html |title=New choice for school chaplaincy program |last1=Collins |first1=Sarah-Jane |date=8 September 2011 |work=[[The Age]] |publisher= |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 2013 there were 2,339 chaplains and 512 student welfare workers employed under NSCP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.education.gov.au/documents/national-school-chaplaincy-and-student-welfare-program-statistics|title=National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the [[Abbott Government]] removed the provision to fund secular student well-being officers, meaning all chaplains had to be affiliated with a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sslcam.news.com.au/cam/authorise?channel=pc&amp;url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2fnational-affairs%2fbudget-2014%2ftop-spending-outlay-offers-245m-for-religious-advisers-in-schools%2fstory-fnmbxsc8-1226916655977 |title=Top spending outlay offers $245m for religious advisers in schools |last1=Ferrari |first1=Justine |date=14 May 2014 |work=[[The Australian]] |publisher= |accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2014 Australian federal budget|2014 federal budget]], the government increased the funds for NSCP to $243.8 million over a four-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2014/05/13/20/47/school-chaplains-get-243m-over-4-years|title=School chaplains get $243m over 4 years|date=14 May 2014|work=[[Nine MSN]]|accessdate=23 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523064620/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2014/05/13/20/47/school-chaplains-get-243m-over-4-years|archivedate=23 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=det/&gt; Following the invalidation of NSCP by the High Court in June 2014,&lt;ref name=HC2014/&gt; the Government redesigned NSCP, with funding now being delivered via states and territories rather than directly to schools.&lt;ref name=det/&gt; The new NSCP did not involve any other changes to policy.&lt;ref name=SMHAug2014&gt;SMH, 27 August 2014: [http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbott-to-keep-secular-workers-out-of-school-chaplaincy-program-20140827-1091u0.html Tony Abbott to keep secular workers out of school chaplaincy program]&lt;/ref&gt; Agreements for the new NSCP were reached with all state and territory governments by 17 November 2014.&lt;ref name=det/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SMH, 10 October 2014: [http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/school-chaplaincy-program-government-stands-firm-on-excluding-welfare-workers-20141010-114bt2.html School chaplaincy program: government stands firm on excluding welfare workers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==High Court challenges==

===2012 High Court challenge===
{{main|Williams v Commonwealth}}
In the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] case of ''Williams v The Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Ors [2012] HCA 23'' (also known as the "School chaplains case")&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2012/hca23-2012-06-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the executive prerogative and spending under [[Chapter II of the Constitution of Australia#Section 61: Executive power|section 61 of the Australian Constitution]] was challenged. The Court handed down its ruling in June 2012, that the Commonwealth's funding agreement for NSCP was invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-20/high-court-upholds-chaplaincy-challenge/4081456 |title=High Court upholds chaplaincy challenge |work=ABC News |location=Australia |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 High Court challenge===
A second High Court challenge, against the amended programme, was mounted by the 2012 litigant and was heard by the Court in May 2014. The High Court handed down its ruling on 19 June 2014.&lt;ref name=HC2014&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2014/23.html AustLII: Williams v Commonwealth of Australia [2014&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; HCA 23 (19 June 2014) ]&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of this case was whether the federal government has the power to fund the NSCP directly through local organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-06/high-court-challenge-to-school-chaplaincy-program/5432926 |title=School chaplaincy case: Queensland father again challenges validity of program in High Court |last1=Byrne |first1=Elizabeth |date=6 May 2014 |website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This second challenge also succeeded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-06-19/high-court-delivers-verdict-on-school-chaplaincy-program/5534546|title=Commonwealth funding of school chaplaincy program struck down in High Court|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hurst/&gt; so that over $154 million in funding hitherto paid to a local organisation in Queensland became a debt. 

However, the federal government responded by waiving that debt and making a commitment to circumvent the High Court ruling and continue with the budgeted $243 million spending on NSCP.&lt;ref name=hurst&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hurst|first1=Daniel|title=School chaplains funding struck down by high court|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/19/school-chaplains-struck-down-high-court|accessdate=24 November 2014|agency=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian Australia|date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Religious representation==
While the NSCP is formally not religion-specific, the chaplains employed under the programme are disproportionately [[Christianity|Christian]]. In 2011, one study stated that 96.5% of the chaplains employed under the programme were Christian, while only 64% of Australians identified as Christian (based on the 2006 census). By contrast, 0.01% of the chaplains were secular, whereas 19% of Australians identified as having no religion. [[Buddhism]], the second largest religion, is followed by 2% of Australians, but only 0.03% of the school chaplains. [[Islam]] was followed by 1.7% of Australians, but only 0.9% of school chaplains. [[Judaism]] is the only religion which had a roughly proportionate representation, with 0.45% of the Australian population following the religion, and 0.5% of school chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/school-chaplains-not-representative/story-fn59niix-1226004703831|title=School chaplains not representative|date=12 February 2011|work=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was announced in May 2014 that the provision to allow secular welfare workers under NSCP would be removed, changing the definition of chaplain to someone ordained, commissioned or endorsed by a recognised religious institution. From December 2014, the 623 schools who were then hiring a secular welfare worker had to either hire a chaplain instead or go without either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-02/non-religious-chaplains-may-not-be-funded-under-new-programme/5935450|title=Non-religious chaplains may not be funded under new chaplaincy program in 2015|author=John Stewart|work=[[Lateline]]|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/chaplaincy-program-leaves-secular-workers-with-no-more-than-a-prayer-20140520-38mnf.html? |title=Chaplaincy program leaves secular workers with no more than a prayer |last1=Knott |first1=Matthew |date=21 May 2014 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
NSCP has been controversial since it was announced by [[John Howard]] in 2006. The NSCP is most commonly opposed on the grounds that chaplains are under-qualified to deal with vulnerable young people,&lt;ref name=risk/&gt; that it is not appropriate to have a religious worker in a public school,&lt;ref name=appropriate/&gt; and that the money spent on the programme is better needed elsewhere, such as to help children with disabilities.&lt;ref name=blast/&gt; A July 2011 report by the Commonwealth Ombudsman recommended changes in guidelines after it was found that some chaplains provided one-on-one counselling when not qualified to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ombudsman.gov.au/files/commonwealth_ombudsman_chaplaincy_report_06_11.pdf|title=Administration of the National School Chaplaincy Program - Report by the Commonwealth Omburdsman|author=Allan Asher|date=July 2011|publisher=Commonwealth Ombudsman|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211224017/http://www.ombudsman.gov.au/files/commonwealth_ombudsman_chaplaincy_report_06_11.pdf|archivedate=11 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints have also been made that chaplains have used their position to recruit children to Christianity in breach of government guidelines. The number of complaints specifically regarding proselytising was 34 in 2011, 5 in 2012 and 1 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/09/complaints-about-school-chaplaincy-program-on-the-decline-figures-show |title=Complaints about school chaplaincy program on the decline, figures show |last1=Hurst |first1=Daniel |date=9 June 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints have also been made that chaplains have handed out literature stating homosexuality is wrong, that condoms promote promiscuity and are not effective for use as a contraceptive.&lt;ref name=risk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/school-christian-chaplain-program-puts-kids-at-risk-warn-counsellors-and-psychologists/story-e6frfkvr-1226083530464 |title=School Christian chaplain program puts kids 'at risk', warn counsellors and psychologists |date=28 June 2011 |work=[[News.com.au]] |publisher= |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall complaints about any aspect of the chaplaincy programme that were made to the relevant department was 93 in 2011, 51 in 2012 and 34 in 2013. Of the 85 between 2012 and 2013, 60% could not be substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/Estimates/Live/eet_ctte/estimates/bud_1415/Education/Tabled_documents/Tabled_Doc_5.pdf |title=Untitled document |date= |work=aph.gov.au |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online petition opposing the 2014 funding increase for the NSCP was signed by over 180,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/safe-schools-program-chaplaincy-scheme-dont-mix-experts-20140607-39q4u.html |title=Safe Schools program, chaplaincy scheme don't mix: experts |last1=Stark |first1=Jill |date=8 June 2014 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 whilst she was Prime Minister, [[Julia Gillard]] voiced her support for the NSCP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2010/08/10/2978228.htm |title=The Prime Minister puts her faith in chaplaincy |last1=Stephens |first1=Scott |date=10 August 2010 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |publisher= |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 [[Peter Garrett]] publicly stated his support for the programme,&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/public-puts-its-trust-in-chaplaincy-program-20110907-1jxd4.html |title=Public puts its trust in chaplaincy program |last1=Garrett |first1=Peter |authorlink=Peter Garrett |date=8 September 2011 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher= |accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in a 2014 book review he stated "the line between chaplains acting to support students in the provision of general pastoral care and proselytising was too easily crossed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydneyreviewofbooks.com/taking-god-to-school-marion-maddox/|title=FREE, COMPULSORY AND SECULAR|author=Peter Garrett|date=30 May 2014|work=[[Sydney Review of Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/former-education-minister-peter-garrett-says-state-schools-not-capable-of-delivering-comparatively-thorough-education/story-fngqim8m-1226937782076|title=Former education minister Peter Garrett says state schools ‘not capable of delivering comparatively thorough education’|date=30 May 2014|work=News.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other politicians supporting the programme include Senator [[Eric Abetz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-05-16/abetz-regrets/5459110 |title=Abetz Regrets |last1=Kimbal |first1=Chris |date=16 May 2014 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC]]|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ohr Torah Stone''' (OTS) ({{lang-he-n|'''אור תורה סטון'''}}) is a [[Jewish]] Modern Orthodox movement, which was founded by [[Shlomo Riskin|Rabbi Shlomo Riskin]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Abramson, A Circle in the Square: Rabbi Shlomo Riskin Reinvents the Synagogue, Urim Publications 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100951, Rabbinical Council of America Website, Unknown Author,  Retrieved on April 23, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  
OTS is a comprehensive educational and social network headed by Founder and Chancellor Rabbi Shlomo Riskin and Co-Chancellor Rabbi [[David Stav]].  
OTS consists of 28 programs on 10 campuses throughout the State of [[Israel]]. The organization also includes a network of 300-plus emissaries who are currently serving in positions of spiritual and educational leadership across the globe in [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Central America]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Eliahu Birnbaum, "Rav Olami," First Source (Hebrew), October 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/11/ART2/625/536.html|title=Kshe'Kol haShofar Nishma Be'veit haKele Be'Meksiko|first=Rabbi Nir|last=Koren|publisher=[[Nrg.co.il|NRG]]|date=23 September 2014|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/11/ART2/660/324.html|title=Chanuka be'Kolumbia|first=Rabbi Nir|last=Koren|publisher=[[Nrg.co.il|NRG]]|date=21 December 2014|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=http://www.kipa.co.il/family/68049.html|title=Emissaries in their Own Right|first=Shira|last=Ravid|publisher=Kipa Website|date=27 June 2016|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
OTS has initiatied numerous programs in the realm of women's leadership and empowerment, leadership training, Jewish outreach, and social action, which have received both national and international acclaim for their groundbreaking nature.&lt;ref name="leiber-jpost"&gt;Isi Leibler, "The Incredible Rabbi Shlomo Riskin," The Jerusalem Post, Thursday, March 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; OTS has stated that its primary guiding principle is to ensure the accessibility of Judaism to each and every Jew--particularly addressing populations which had been previously marginalized, disenfranchised or alienated.&lt;ref&gt;Zev Eleff, Modern Orthodox Judaism: A Documentary History, University of Nebraska Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chagai Segel, First Source (Hebrew), January 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905446,00.html|title=The Sound of the Shofar|publisher=[[TIME Magazine]]|date=4 October 1971|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Jewish women's empowerment==

OTS's programs for women have opened doors in the realm of Jewish Orthodox female scholarship and leadership that had previously been shut to the entire female population. OTS started the first school to teach post-[[high school]] women [[Talmud]] on a high level. OTS’s women’s college features the largest women’s [[beit midrash]] [study hall] in Jewish history. The college has produced female leaders of Jewish communities worldwide, including the first female to officially serve as the director of a rabbinical court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Woman-to-serve-as-rabbinical-court-administrator-in-Efrat-472701|title=Woman to Serve as Rabbinical Court Administrator|first=Jeremy|last=Sharon|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=15 November 2016|access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/In-Jerusalem/Intergenerational-learning-479683|title=Intergenerational Learning|first=Hannaah|last=Katsman|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=26 January 2017|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OTS's women's college developed a program specifically for women with special needs. The curriculum allows participants to acquire both learning and vocational skills, build independence and improve self-esteem, while expanding their love of [[Torah]], Israel, and the Jewish people. The program had proven so successful that in 2017, a parallel program was established for young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/printarticle.aspx?id=306583|title=‘Kol dichfin, kol ditzrich’: All with special needs|first=BARBARA|last=SOFER|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=15 March 2013|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bracha Bender, "A Year of their Own," Mishpacha Magazine, Vol. Feb 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another OTS program enables religious women to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]]: where previously these women were forced to choose between service to their country and living an observant lifestyle, now they are inducted as a group and strengthened by intense study before, during and after their service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iba.org.il/program.aspx?scode=2180376|title=Tzulam beYom Chol|first=Natan|last=Datner|publisher=[[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/printarticle.aspx?id=31079|title=Women of Valor: Rabbis spar over IDF service for women|first=Matthew|last=Wagner|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=9 August 2006|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OTS also opened the first school in the world to train women and certify them as advocates in the [[Rabbinical Court|Rabbinical Courts]].  Only because of OTS’s appeal to the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] did women win the legal right to practice in the Courts –an arena which was, previously open only to men.  The school then opened a Legal Aid Center and Hotline for Israeli women who are agunot (The [[agunah]] is a woman literally “chained” to a dead or abusive marriage whose husband refuses to grant her a Jewish writ of divorce) and are in need of free advice and legal representation in matters pertaining to the process of obtaining a religious divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Father-of-divorce-refuser-avoids-jail-time-but-banned-from-leaving-Israel-478620|title=Father of Divorce Refuser Avoids Jail Time, But Banned From Leaving Israel|first=Jeremy|last=Sharon|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=16 January 2017|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.708903|title=In Historic Ruling, Israeli Rabbinical Court Jails Father for Abetting Son's Refusal of Divorce|first=Yair|last=Ettinger|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date=15 March 2016|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary Jewish leadership==
Ohr Torah Stone’s Rabbinical Seminary prepares rabbis to be both fluent in secular learning as well as the [[Talmud]]. The curriculum is one which is immersed in contemporary concerns as well as Jewish law and legal texts. At the same time, the OTS Educators Institute comprehensively trains educators to teach Judaic Studies in both Orthodox and non-Orthodox state and community schools across Israel and the Diaspora.

An additional OTS yeshiva is geared towards young men both with and without previous yeshiva backgrounds from North America, [[Europe]], [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]].

Hundreds of OTS-trained teachers and spiritual leaders have served in communities spanning the globe.&lt;ref&gt;http://hamodia.com/2017/04/19/torn-torah-scrolls-laid-rest-74-years/, Hamodia Staff, "Torn Torah Scrolls Laid to Rest After 74 Years," Wednesday, April 19, 2017 at 6:38 pm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ots.org.il/straus-seminary-musmach-appointed-chief-rabbi-frankfurt/, "Straus Seminary Musmach Elected Chief Rabbi of Frankfurt", March 9, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many of the OTS graduates have joined the ranks of OTS trained Jewish Cultural Facilitators who provide formal and informal Jewish education for Israelis of all ages and backgrounds. This initiative works in conjunction with Israeli Community Centers. Media coverage has reported that these facilitators actively promote Jewish values, national unity, and heritage awareness in a non-coercive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/723/995.html|title=We Need to Serve as a Light Unto the Nations and Serve as a Model of Unity|first=Gil|last=Kopatch|publisher=[[Nrg.co.il|NRG]]|date=8 September 2015|access-date=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leiber-jpost" /&gt;

==OTS high schools==

OTS has established 6 modern Orthodox high schools within the Jerusalem and Gush Etzion regions. All of these high schools offer official matriculation and have been awarded recognition of excellence from the Israeli Ministry of Education.

==OTS around the world==

Each year, OTS sends spiritual and educational leaders to serve as emissaries in Jewish communities all over the world. These emissaries are active in [[Synagogue|synagogues]], campuses and schools, and Jewish communities across the globe.

'''OpenStax''' (formerly OpenStax College) is a nonprofit ed-tech initiative based at [[Rice University]]. Since 2012, OpenStax has created peer-reviewed, [[open textbook|openly licensed textbook]]s, which are available in free digital formats and for a low cost in print. Most books are also available in [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] versions on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]] and in the [[iBooks]] Store. OpenStax's first textbook was ''College Physics'', which was published online, in print, and in iBooks in 2012. OpenStax has also launched OpenStax Tutor, an adaptive courseware based on cognitive science principles, machine learning, and OpenStax content.

In 2017, OpenStax announced that they were partnering with UK Open Textbooks to spread the use of their open content in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.rice.edu/2017/09/12/rice-university-based-openstax-partners-with-uk-open-textbooks-2/|title=Rice University-based OpenStax partners with UK Open Textbooks|website=news.rice.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and partnering with Katalyst Education to form OpenStax Polska, bringing Polish-language versions of select OpenStax books to universities in Poland.

== Editorial process ==
OpenStax textbooks follow a traditional peer review process to ensure they meet high quality standard before publication. Textbooks are developed and peer-reviewed by educators to ensure they are readable and accurate, meet the scope and sequence requirements of each course, are supported by instructor ancillaries, and are available with the latest technology-based learning tools.

The free, online version of OpenStax books are kept up-to-date on an ongoing basis. Instructors are encouraged to submit errata suggestions via the OpenStax website, and errata suggestions are reviewed by subject matter experts. Revisions are made when it is determined to be pedagogically necessary. New PDFs and print versions of the books are released each summer when substantial changes are present.

==List of textbooks==

OpenStax's original goal was to publish openly licensed textbooks for the 25 highest-enrolled undergraduate college courses, and they exceeded that goal in 2016. All books are available for free in web view and PDF format on openstax.org. The books are also available for a low cost in print, and many of them exist in iBooks. {{As of|2018}}, the OpenStax library includes the following&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Subjects - OpenStax | url = https://openstax.org/subjects | access-date = 2018-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a textbook name followed by “2e” indicates a second edition):

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">'''The Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Associated Literature''' was established in 1995 as part of the Institute for Jewish Studies at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Its overarching aim is to stimulate all aspects of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Over the years it has hosted a series of symposia bringing together many of the world's experts on the scrolls to give papers on topics related to the specific theme of that year's symposium. Past symposia have examined such subjects as the Damascus Document, wisdom literature and the reworking of biblical literature. Many of these symposia have been published by the center.

Since 1999 the Orion Center has held regular seminars relating to the Dead Sea Scrolls in memory of Professor [[Jonas C. Greenfield]]. [[Emanuel Tov]] gave the inaugural seminar on "The Greek Texts from the Judaean Desert".

A '''paradox''' is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=paradox|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/paradox|website=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bolander|first1=Thomas|title=Self-Reference|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-reference/|accessdate=21 June 2016|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A paradox involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. K. and Lewis, M. W. (2011). Toward a theory of paradox: A dynamic equilibrium model of organizing. ''Academy of Management Review,'' 36, pp. 381-403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Y., Waldman, D. A., Han, Y., and Li, X. (2015). Paradoxical leader behaviors in people management: Antecedents and consequences. ''Academy of Management Journal,'' 58, pp. 538-566&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Waldman and    David E. Bowen (2016), Learning to Be a Paradox-Savvy Leader, ''Academy of Management -- Perspectives,'' vol. 30, no. 3, 316-327, {{doi|10.5465/amp.2015.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some logical paradoxes are known to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]] arguments but are still valuable in promoting [[critical thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eliason |first=James L. |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9604072434/using-paradoxes-teach-critical-thinking-science |title=Using Paradoxes to Teach Critical Thinking in Science |journal=Journal of College Science Teaching |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=341–44 |date=March–April 1996 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions assumed to be rigorous, and have caused [[axioms]] of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is [[Russell's paradox]], which questions whether a "list of all lists that do not contain themselves" would include itself, and showed that attempts to found [[set theory]] on the identification of sets with [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] were flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Crossley | first1=J.N. | last2=Ash | first2=C.J. | last3=Brickhill | first3=C.J. | last4=Stillwell | first4=J.C. | last5=Williams | first5=N.H. | title=What is mathematical logic? | zbl=0251.02001 | location=London-Oxford-New York | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1972 | isbn=0-19-888087-1 | pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Curry's paradox]], are not yet resolved.

Examples outside logic include the [[ship of Theseus]] from philosophy (questioning whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship). Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, [[M.C. Escher]] featured [[Perspective (visual)|perspective-based]] paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aminotes.tumblr.com/post/653017235/the-mathematical-art-of-m-c-escher-for-me-it |title=The Mathematical Art of M.C. Escher |website=Lapidarium notes |editor-first=Amira |editor-last=Skomorowska |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, the word "paradox" often refers to statements that may be both true and false i.e. [[irony|ironic]] or unexpected, such as "the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking".&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/paradox |title=Paradox |website=Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical paradox==
{{See also|List of paradoxes}}
Common themes in paradoxes include [[self-reference]], [[infinite regress]], [[circular definition]]s, and confusion between different levels of [[abstraction]].

[[Patrick Hughes (artist)|Patrick Hughes]] outlines three laws of the paradox:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Self-reference: An example is "This statement is false", a form of the [[liar paradox]]. The statement is referring to itself. Another example of self-reference is the question of whether the [[barber]] shaves himself in the [[barber paradox]]. One more example would be "Is the answer to this question 'No'?"
;Contradiction: "This statement is false"; the statement cannot be false and true at the same time. Another example of contradiction is if a man talking to a genie wishes that wishes couldn't come true.  This contradicts itself because if the genie grants his wish, he did not grant his wish, and if he refuses to grant his wish, then he did indeed grant his wish, therefore making it impossible either to grant or not grant his wish because his wish contradicts itself.
;Vicious circularity, or infinite regress: "This statement is false"; if the statement is true, then the statement is false, thereby making the statement true. Another example of [[vicious circle|vicious circularity]] is the following group of statements:
:: "The following sentence is true."
:: "The previous sentence is false."

Other paradoxes involve [[false statement]]s ("'impossible' is not a word in my vocabulary", a simple paradox) or [[half-truths]] and the resulting [[cognitive bias|biased]] assumptions.  This form is common in [[Howler (error)|howlers]].

For example, consider a situation in which a father and his son are driving down the road.  The car crashes into a tree and the father is killed.  The boy is rushed to the nearest hospital where he is prepared for emergency [[surgery]].  Upon entering the surgery-suite, the surgeon says, "I can't operate on this boy.  He's my son."

The apparent paradox is caused by a [[hasty generalization]], for if the surgeon is the boy's father, the statement cannot be true.  The paradox is resolved if it is revealed that the surgeon is a woman — the boy's mother.

Paradoxes which are not based on a hidden error generally occur at the fringes of context or [[language]], and require extending the context or language in order to lose their paradoxical quality.  Paradoxes that arise from apparently intelligible uses of language are often of interest to [[logic]]ians and [[philosopher]]s.  "This sentence is false" is an example of the well-known [[liar paradox]]: it is a sentence which cannot be consistently interpreted as either true or false, because if it is known to be false, then it is known that it must be true, and if it is known to be true, then it is known that it must be false. [[Russell's paradox]], which shows that the notion of ''the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all those sets that do not contain themselves'' leads to a contradiction, was instrumental in the development of modern logic and set theory.

[[Thought-experiment]]s can also yield interesting paradoxes. The [[grandfather paradox]], for example, would arise if a [[time-travel]]er were to kill his own grandfather before his mother or father had been conceived, thereby preventing his own birth. This is a specific example of the more general observation of the [[butterfly effect]], or that a time-traveller's interaction with the past — however slight — would entail making changes that would, in turn, change the future in which the time-travel was yet to occur, and would thus change the circumstances of the time-travel itself.

Often a seemingly paradoxical conclusion arises from an inconsistent or inherently contradictory definition of the initial premise.  In the case of that apparent paradox of a time-traveler killing his own grandfather, it is the inconsistency of defining the past to which he returns as being somehow different from the one which leads up to the future from which he begins his trip, but also insisting that he must have come to that past from the same future as the one that it leads up to.

==Quine's classification&lt;!--Linked from 'Willard Van Orman Quine'--&gt;==
{{see also|Veridicality}}

[[W. V. Quine]] (1962) distinguished between three classes of paradoxes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Ways of Paradox, and other essays | last1 = Quine | first1 = W.V. | authorlink = W.V. Quine | year = 1966 | publisher = Random House | publication-place = New York | chapter =  The ways of paradox }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''veridical paradox'' produces a result that appears absurd but is demonstrated to be true nonetheless.  Thus the paradox of Frederic's birthday in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' establishes the surprising fact that a twenty-one-year-old would have had only five birthdays if he had been born on a [[leap day]].  Likewise, [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] demonstrates difficulties in mapping voting- results to the will of the people.  The [[Monty Hall paradox]] demonstrates that a decision which has an intuitive 50–50 chance is in fact heavily biased towards making a decision which, given the intuitive conclusion, the player would be unlikely to make.  In 20th-Century science, [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and [[Schrödinger's cat]] are famously vivid examples of a theory being taken to a logical but paradoxical end.
* A ''falsidical paradox'' establishes a result that not only ''appears'' false but actually ''is'' false, due to a fallacy in the demonstration.  The various [[invalid proof|invalid mathematical proofs]] (e.g., that 1 = 2) are classic examples, generally relying on a hidden [[division by zero]]. Another example is the inductive form of the [[All horses are the same colour|horse paradox]], which falsely generalises from true specific statements.  [[Zeno's paradoxes]] are 'falsidical', concluding, for example, that a flying arrow never reaches its target or that a speedy runner cannot catch up to a tortoise with a small head-start.
* A paradox that is in neither class may be an ''[[antinomy]]'', which reaches a self-contradictory result by properly applying accepted ways of reasoning.  For example, the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]] points out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of truth and description.
A fourth kind has sometimes been described since Quine's work.
* A paradox that is both true and false at the same time and in the same sense is called a ''[[dialetheia]]''.  In Western logics it is often assumed, following [[Aristotle]], that no ''dialetheia'' exist, but they are sometimes accepted in Eastern traditions (e.g. in the [[Mohists]],&lt;ref name="SchoolOfNames"&gt;The [[School of Names|Logicians]] ([[Warring States period]]),[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/school-names/paradoxes.html "Miscellaneous paradoxes"] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gongsun Longzi]],&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Zen]]&lt;ref&gt;Chung-ying Cheng (1973) "[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Philosophical/OnZenLanguage.htm On Zen (Ch’an) Language and Zen Paradoxes]" ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'', '''V. 1''' (1973) pp. 77-102&lt;/ref&gt;) and in [[paraconsistent logic]]s.  It would be mere equivocation or a matter of degree, for example, to both affirm and deny that "John is here" when John is halfway through the door but it is self-contradictory simultaneously to affirm and deny the event.

==In philosophy==
A taste for paradox is central to the philosophies of [[Laozi]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Bhartrhari]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[G.K. Chesterton]], among many others.  Søren Kierkegaard, for example, writes in the ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' that
&lt;blockquote&gt;But one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow.  But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall.  This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |editor1-first=Howard V. |editor1-last=Hong |editor2-first=Edna H. |editor2-last=Hong |title=Philosophical Fragments |year=1844 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuMoXUAaEr0C&amp;pg=PA37 |publisher=Princeton University Press |publication-date=1985 |isbn=9780691020365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In medicine==
A [[paradoxical reaction]] to a [[drug]] is the opposite of what one would expect, such as becoming agitated by a [[sedative]] or sedated by a [[stimulant]]. Some are common and are used regularly in medicine, such as the use of  stimulants such as [[Adderall]] and [[Ritalin]] in the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (also known as ADHD) while others are rare and can be dangerous as they are not expected, such as severe agitation from a [[benzodiazepine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Psychopharmacology of Agitation: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA Psychopharmacology Workgroup |pmc=3298219 |website=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patricia Flatley Brennan''' is the director of the [[National Library of Medicine]]. Prior to that, she was the Lillian L. Moehlman Bascom Professor, School of Nursing and College of Engineering, at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Brennan received a [[Master of Science]] in [[Nursing]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and a Ph.D. in [[Industrial Engineering]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].&lt;ref name="Brennan bio"&gt;[http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ie/faculty/brennan_patricia.html Patricia Brennan faculty page]&lt;/ref&gt; She served as chair of [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] College of Engineering's Department of Industrial Engineering from 2007 to 2010.

==Career==
Following seven years of clinical practice in [[critical care nursing]] and [[psychiatric nursing]], Brennan held several academic positions. She developed ComputerLink, an electronic network designed to reduce isolation and improve self-care among [[home care]] patients.

Brennan is the National Program Director of Project HealthDesign, a [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]]-funded initiative designed to stimulate the next generation of personal health records. In the context of that project, she coined the phrase "[[Observations of Daily Living]]" with her team, referring to observations people make about their health in everyday life. Additionally, she leads the WI-TECNE project, a statewide nursing faculty development effort supported by [[Health Resources and Services Administration|HRSA]] that aims to improve the integration of informatics and [[telehealth]] into nursing curricula. As of June 2009, Brennan was a theme leader of the Living Environments Lab at the [[Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery]], researching home health care technologies using virtual reality and simulation technology.&lt;ref name="Brennan Health Systems Lab"&gt;[http://healthsystems.engr.wisc.edu/index.html Brennan Health Systems Lab]&lt;/ref&gt;

A fellow of both the [[American Academy of Nursing]] (1991) and the [[American College of Medical Informatics]] (1993), Brennan was elected a member of the [[Institute of Medicine]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="MNRS Honors Brennan"&gt;[http://www.son.wisc.edu/news/brennan.html MNRS Honors Brennan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727201226/http://www.son.wisc.edu/news/brennan.html |date=2009-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, she was appointed director of the [[National Library of Medicine]], where her term started in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-appoints-patricia-flatley-brennan-rn-phd-lead-national-library-medicine|title=NIH appoints Patricia Flatley Brennan, R.N., Ph.D., to lead the National Library of Medicine|date=2016-05-09|website=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rajiv D. Banker''' (born 1953) is an accounting researcher and educator, recognized by the Institute for Scientific Information ([[Web of Science]]) as one of the 150 most influential researchers in economics and business.&lt;ref name="Rajiv D. Banker"&gt;https://sites.temple.edu/banker/bio/&lt;/ref&gt; He is the Director of the Center for Accounting and Information Technology at the [[Fox School of Business and Management]], [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name="Rajiv D. Banker" /&gt; He is also President of the International Data Envelopment Analysis Society &lt;ref&gt;http://deasociety.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and Editor-in-Chief of the Data Envelopment Analysis Journal.&lt;ref&gt;http://deasociety.org/home/journal&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and early career ==

Banker obtained his Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Bombay in 1973, and his PhD at [[Harvard University]] in 1980.

His early research focused on [[productivity]],&lt;ref&gt;“Productivity Measurement and Management Control,” The Management of Productivity and Technology in Manufacturing, P. Kleindorfer (Ed.), Plenum, New York, NY, (1985), pp. 239-257.&lt;/ref&gt; [[economies of scale]],&lt;ref&gt;“Scale Economies in New Software Development,” with C. Kemerer, IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 15, 10, (October 1989), pp. 1199-1205.&lt;/ref&gt; [[operational efficiency]],&lt;ref&gt;“Measuring Gains in Operational Efficiency from Information Technology: A Case Study of the Positran Deployment at Hardee’s, Inc.,” with R. Kauffman and R. Morey, Journal of Management Information Systems, (Fall 1990), pp. 29-54.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[data envelopment analysis]]. His research on data envelopment analysis includes 15 articles co-authored with [[William W. Cooper]] from 1984 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;“Models for Estimating Technical and Scale Inefficiencies in Data Envelopment Analysis,” with A. Charnes and W.W. Cooper, Management Science, 30, 9, (September 1984), pp. 1078-1092.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Returns to Scale in DEA,” with W.W. Cooper, L. Seiford and J. Zhu, in Handbook on Data Envelopment Analysis, W.W. Cooper, L. Seiford and J. Zhu (Eds.), Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA, (2011), pp. 43-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Banker co-authored a textbook called ''Management Accounting'' with Anthony Akinson, [[Robert S. Kaplan]] and Mark Young.&lt;ref&gt;Management Accounting, with A. Atkinson, R. Kaplan and M. Young, Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ, First edition (1995). {{ISBN|0131854488}} {{ISBN|9780131854482}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This textbook is now in its third edition. He also co-authored a book on the [[balanced scorecard]].&lt;ref&gt;Balanced Scorecard: Linking Strategy to Performance, with S. Janakiraman and C. Konstans, Financial Executives Research Foundation, Morris Town, NJ (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

From mid 2004 to early 2005, Banker served only a short term as Dean of the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management (AGSM) at the University of California Riverside, during which he spent considerable time in India conducting research, and then later served as a "special assistant" in the chancellor's office after leaving his position as Dean.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Auditor-blasts-UC-s-pay-practices-University-2519099.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/18/local/me-uc18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://newsroom.ucr.edu/656&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==

'''''Rome: Caesar's Will''''' is an educational adventure game released in 2000.

== Production ==
A substantial part of the game's promotion was focused on an "innovative dialogue and artificial intelligence engine" called ReActiveAttitudes technology, which meant that the player could have a personality or "mask" when speaking to a character. If the player approaches the character in a "friendly" or "insulting" way, this would affect how the character interacted, resulting in branching narratives of allies and enemies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Rome/Rome.shtm|title=Review: Rome: Caesar's Will|date=2001-07-18|access-date=2017-02-02|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010718111326/http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Rome/Rome.shtm|archivedate=2001-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The game revolves around a murder mystery set in 44BC. As a Roman legioner, the player takes on the role of detective who has to prove Aurelia didn't poison her husband, and solve the crime before time runs out.

== Gameplay ==
The game has a time limit of 40 hours; actions such as moving locations via the map cause the player to lose precious seconds. The interface contains an inventory of items, a notepad to write down clues, and an encyclopedia to give the player additional background knowledge as they play.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jeuxvideo.com/articles/0000/00000625_test.htm|title=Test Rome : Le Testament De Cesar sur PC|newspaper=Jeuxvideo.com|language=fr|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
''Jeux Video'' praised the music and sound effects for creating a sense of atmospheric suspense.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tom Houston of ''Just Adventure'' criticised the ReActiveAttitudes technology for not delivering a diverging series of stories as promised.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Scott Spencer''' (born September 1, 1945 in [[Washington, D.C.]]) is an American author who has written eleven novels. He also wrote the screenplay for the 1993 movie ''[[Father Hood]]''. Two of Spencer's novels, ''Endless Love'' and ''[[Waking the Dead (novel)|Waking the Dead]],'' have been adapted into films. ''Endless Love'' was first adapted into a [[Endless Love (1981 film)|motion picture]] by [[Franco Zeffirelli]] in [[1981 in film|1981]], and a [[Endless Love (2014 film)|second adaptation]] by [[Shana Feste]] was released in 2014. ''[[Waking the Dead (film)|Waking the Dead]]'' was produced by [[Jodie Foster]] and directed by [[Keith Gordon]] in [[2000 in film|2000]]. The novels ''Endless Love'' and ''A Ship Made of Paper'' have both been nominated for the [[National Book Award]], with ''Endless Love'' selling over 2 million copies. Spencer has heavily panned both film adaptations of ''Endless Love''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/09/10/spoiler-alert/ | location=Paris | work=The Paris Review | first=Scott | last=Spencer | title=Spoiler Alert | date=September 10, 2013 | accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alex-pettyfer-endless-love-remake-680560 | location=Hollywood | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Tim | last=Appelo | title='Endless Love' Author Trashes Remake: 'Stick With the Paperback' | date=February 14, 2014 | accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed in ''The New York Times'', Spencer once said: "It may be time for serious, literary novelists to take back some of the subject matter we abandoned to hack novelists and the movies."  [[Joyce Carol Oates]], writing about ''A Ship Made of Paper'' in [[The New Yorker]], said: "Like [[John Cheever|Cheever]], Spencer has imagined for his... infatuated lover melodramatic crises that verge on the surreal; like [[John Updike]], Spencer is a poet-celebrant of Eros, lyrically precise in his descriptions of lovers' fantasies, lovers' lovemaking, lovers' bodies..."  ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' has said: "There are few novelists alive who use the English language as Scott Spencer does... Every ache of feeling, every failed effort at restraint, every attempt at self-deception is captured in precise, beautifully cadenced prose."

Spencer has also worked as a journalist. He has published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[GQ]]'', ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]'', and he is a regular contributor to ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

He has taught at [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Iowa]], [[Williams College]],  Bard College's [[Bard Prison Initiative]], and the University of Virginia. Spencer attended the University of Illinois,  [[Roosevelt University]], and graduated from the University of Wisconsin. In 2004, he was the recipient of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].  For the past twenty years, he has lived in a small town in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]].

For some of his latest works, two sequenced [[Horror fiction|horror novels]], Spencer has chosen the pseudonym ″Chase Novak″.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Cole Garner|title=Chase Novak Lampoons Manhattan Parenting in First Horror Novel, "Breed"|url=http://www.booksnreview.com/articles/1034/20120913/chase-novak-breed-lampoons-manhatten-parenting-first-horror-novel.htm|publisher=Books &amp; Review|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scottish Credit and Qualifcations Framework Logo.png|thumb|right|100px|SCQF logo]]
The '''Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework''' (SCQF) is the national [[Credit (education)|credit transfer system]] for all levels of qualifications in Scotland. The Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework Partnership promotes [[lifelong learning]] in the country. Through the SCQF, learners can gain a better understanding of qualifications and plan their future learning. 

The SCQF is in the custody of, and managed by, the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework Partnership (SCQF Partnership). Since its creation in November 2006 the SCQF Partnership, which is a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity, has aimed to: ensure that, where appropriate, all assessed learning and qualifications are included within the Framework and extend the recognition of informal and non-formal learning; fully develop and promote the Framework as a [[lifelong learning]] tool; and develop relationships with other frameworks internationally.

Its members are the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]]; [[College Development Network]]; the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]]; and [[Universities Scotland]]. 

==Background==
===SCOTCAT===
[[List of further education colleges in Scotland|Scottish higher education institutions]] had long used the ''SCOTCAT'' (''Scottish Credit Accumulation and Transfer'') system for equating courses from different institutions.  ''SCOTCAT'' had three levels.  Level 1 was equivalent to University 1st Year, an [[Higher National Certificate|HNC]] or a [[Certificate of Higher Education]] (Cert HE).  Level 2 was equivalent to University 2nd Year, an [[Higher National Diploma|HND]] or a [[Diploma of Higher Education]].  Level 3 was equivalent to Years 3 and 4 at a Scottish University, and generally these credits lead to a [[Bachelor's degree|Special]] or [[Bachelor's degree|Honours Degree]].

===Scottish Qualifications Authority===
{{main|Scottish Qualifications Authority}}
Following the creation of the  [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] by the merger of the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority|Scottish Examinations Board]] and [[Scottish Qualifications Authority|SCOTVEC]], efforts were made to unite the different levels of vocational and academic qualifications.  The aim was to make it easier for employers and [[Education in Scotland|education institutions]] to understand the level to which a person had been educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/4595.html |title=Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework |publisher=Scottish Qualifications Agency |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A secondary aim was to remove prejudice against vocational and non-traditional qualifications.

===Establishment===
Following from these two efforts, all the education and training providers in Scotland agreed to create a common framework for all qualifications, both current and historical.  This led to the development of a 12-level framework with courses, units, modules and clusters being placed at a specific level with a credit weighting.

Changes have been made to [[Higher Education]] level courses to prepare the Scottish system for the [[Bologna process]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==The Framework==
The Framework has 12 levels.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:KazakhStudentOlympiadDiploma.jpg|thumb|right|A diploma awarded in the Republic Student Olympiads, in the [[Kazakh SSR]], 1989]] --&gt;
'''Soviet Student Olympiad''' was an annual set of contests for students in [[USSR]]. There were two separate multi-round competitions every year: for higher education (universities) and general education (starting from 7th to 10th/11th grade). Both competitions had several rounds, and winners from lower rounds would go to the next round. Not only individual members, but teams were awarded too. The main difference between two Olympiads was that the school one had separate threads for every grade, while the university one was for all students.

==Contest format==
Both Olympiads had the same format of the contests. Students would come in teams representing their location, e.g. schools or republics. Each contest could have 2-3 parts. For instance, the Republican round of University Olympiads on physics could have three parts: theory, lab and computer modeling. All students were given the same set of problems to solve. They would work on solutions strictly individually - no teamwork was allowed - and then they were scored by judges. Team scores were simply sum of individual member scores. Earlier rounds could take just one round, while the later rounds could span for a week having several parts.

==Olympiads in schools (general education)==

===Overview ===
Contests were conducted on many subject of Soviet school curriculum such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and others.  These Olympiads had several levels based on Soviet Union's administrative structure.  These were:  School, District (''[[Raion]]''), City, Regional (''[[Oblast]]''), Republican and All-Union contests.  These competitions were organized separate for every school grade.  Depending on the subject and geographical region the highest round of the Olympiads varied from the All-Union level in Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry to the Regional level in some other disciplines.

In addition, at certain time Moscow carried out joint "Olympiads in Linguistics and Mathematics" (Олимпиада по языкознанию и математике).  After each such Olympiad its problems were printed in the ''[[Science and Life (Russian)|Science and Life]]'' (''Наука и Жизнь'') [[popular science]] magazine.  There were numerous other Olympiads in Moscow including interdisciplinary "Lomonosov tour".

Besides, there were correspondence Olympiads, in particular, Olympiads carried out by some newspapers, journals and universities.  One of the important correspondence Olympiads was organized by the [[Kvant magazine]]. Its winners were admitted to the Republican round of the All-Union Physics and Mathematics Olympiads.

Also, there were team contests organized for schools to compete for District, City or Regional honors.  There also was a "Physics fight" contest organized by the [[Moscow State University]].  In maths, there were contests organized for cities to compete for Republican and All-Union honors.

===School round===
Every school was supposed to have a school round competition. Judges were from subject teachers. The winners from this round could compete in the next round, representing their schools. Each grade could send 3-4 students to the next round. This round was usually conducted in the beginning of the school year.

===District (Raion) round===
This round was for schools of the administrative division called "Raion" (district), a district of a larger city or of an [[oblast]]. Area rounds were organized by RaiONOs (Russian abbreviation for "District Department of People's Education"). Participants would come in teams, but both teams and individual members were recognized and awarded. The winners form teams representing their areas, consisting of 3-4 students from every grade. Usually, area rounds on each subjects took place in different days, so one student could participate in competitions on several subjects. This round was usually conducted in the first half of the school year.

===City round===
This round was for students of the big cities, which had several areas (Raions). The winners from the previous round could participate. City round was organized by GorONO, i.e., City Department of People's Education. Again, the winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their city. This round's contests on different subjects were conducted on the same day, so a student could compete only in one subject. Depending on a demographic situation, in some places this round was skipped. This round was usually conducted in the first half of the school year.

===Regional (Oblast) round===
This round was for students of the whole region (oblast). The winners from the previous round could participate. Regional round was organized by OblONO, i.e. regional council of education. Again, the winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their region (Oblast). They were joined by the winners of the [[Kvant magazine]] competition and of the republican and All-Union olympiads of the previous year. This round was usually conducted in the second half of the school year.

===Republican round===
This round was a major round, since it recognized the best students of the 15 [[Republics of the Soviet Union]], which are now [[Republics of the Soviet Union#Independent Countries|Independent Countries]]. The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. Republican round was organized by Republican Ministries of Education. The winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their republic. This round was usually conducted in the second half of the school year. In Russia the competition was conducted separately in four zones and was known as the zonal round. Moscow, Leningrad, a few specialized mathematical schools, and the schools of the transportation ministry system did not compete at the republican level and sent their teams directly to the All-Union round.

===All-Union round===
[[File:MathOlympics1969.jpg|150px|thumb|Badge of the participant of III All-Union [[Mathematical]] Olympiad of general education students ([[Kiev]], 1969)]]
This round was a final round for Soviet students. It recognized the best students of the Soviet Union in each subject for every grade. In America, it would be on a national level. The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. This round was organized by Soviet Ministry of Education. This round was usually conducted at the end of the school year.

===Awards===
The winners were awarded with the diplomas. Material prizes were minor and usually included scientific books that were otherwise difficult to obtain.

===History===

===Notable winners===

[[Vladimir Drinfeld]] who was later awarded a 1990 [[Fields medal]] for the development of [[quantum group]]s is considered by many as the most outstanding "mathematical sportsman" in the history of the All-Union Mathematical Olympiads.
His first scientific publication was based on a generalization of an Olympic problem.
Many other winners of the Mathematical Olympiad became outstanding mathematicians and physicists. [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] who solved the [[10th Hilbert problem]] in 1970 was the absolute winner of the 1964 Olympiad.
[[Grigori Perelman|Grisha Perelman]] also had an exceptional Olympic record.

==Olympiads in universities (higher education)==

===Overview ===
Contests were conducted on several subject of Soviet higher education curriculum such as Math, Physics, Programming. These Olympiads had several rounds. The rounds were formed following Soviet Union's administrative structure. So, there were University, Republican and All-Union rounds. There was one contest for all students regardless of their year in the university.

===University round===
Every university was supposed to have its own competition. Judges were from faculty staff. The winners from this round could compete in the next round, representing their university. This round was usually conducted in the beginning of the school year.

===Republican round===
This round was a major round, since it recognized the best university students in each of the republics. The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. Teams had up to a dozen students each. Republican round was organized by Republican Ministries of Education. The winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their republic. This round was usually conducted in the second half of the school year.

===All-Union round===
This round was a final round for Soviet university students. It recognized the best students of the Soviet Union in each subject. In America, it would be on a national level. The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. Teams had 4-5 members. This round was organized by Soviet Ministry of Education. This round was usually conducted in the beginning of the next school year.

===Awards===
The winners were awarded with diplomas and minor material prizes in some cases.

==Moscow Olympiads in Linguistics and Mathematics==
An interesting experiment was olympiads in [[linguistics]] and mathematics, at which students were challenged to solve problems in both seemingly non-related domains. It was argued that problems in linguistics often require logical reasoning akin to that required in mathematics. After the olympiads, the problems (and solutions) were published in the ''[[Science and Life (Russian)|Science and Life]]'' [[popular science]] journal.

'''St. Louis Senior High School''' is a [[Ghana]]ian second-cycle institution in the [[Oduom]] suburb of [[Kumasi]] in the [[Ashanti Region]] for Girls.

==History==
Most Rev. Hubert Pailissen, [[Society of African Missions|SMA]], in early 1949, said; "In this country, scarcely 15 percent of the school-going youth are girls. The people now begin to realize that more must be done in favour of this much–neglected part of the human race, and the chiefs, conscious of their duty towards their subjects, asked us to establish schools for girls in their respective villages…. But to obtain results, it is necessary that the direction of girls' schools should be in the hands of '''Sisters of a Teaching Order''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' with the necessary experience in the latest development of pedagogic methods."&lt;ref&gt;http://stlouisshs.edu.gh/about-us/brief-history&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, on 18 October 1947, the first St. Louis Sisters arrived in the country. They were to continue the running of an already-established elementary school, the St. Bernadette School, now popularly called '''Roman Girls''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'. True to character, the St. Louis Sisters, who never do things by the halves, decided to establish a new secondary school on the same compound.

In 1952, St. Louis Secondary was opened, with an initial group of 12 girls. Only some out of this group survived to join the second group of 1953 to make 42. By December 1957, when the surviving group wrote their "O" Level Examination, they numbered 11.

Most of the salaries of the Sisters, funds raised, and Diocesan contributions went into developing the compound and acquiring necessary inputs.

The church wanted the Apostolate of Education to develop the essential task of forming strong and enlightened Christians, capable of exercising much influence in social and political affairs. Perhaps, there is no branch that needed more attention than female education.

Long before "''Girl child"'' education became a popular slogan, the Catholic Church and St. Louis understood the depth of its importance. That is why the St. Louis Sisters and the Church always adopted an holistic approach to education.

&lt;nowiki/&gt;''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

Despite staffing and financial difficulties, the student population continued to grow. It was clear that further accommodation had to be provided. Through the kindness of Nana Osei Agyemang Prempeh II (the then Asantehene of blessed memory), the requisite site was given, and funds were provided by both the Diocese and the Sisters.

Succeeding reports of inspectors testified to the excellence of teaching given by the Sisters. These reports paid tribute to the school’s "''air of efficiency''" and its "''very good organization and discipline''". It was upon these commendations that the Ministry of Education, in 1960, wished the Sisters would open a Training College on the site on which St. Louis Secondary School now stands. That same year, 1960, a change-over took place, and St. Louis Secondary School moved to its present site. The foundation stone was laid by the late Otumfuo Osei Agyemang Prempeh II, Asantehene, on 25 March 1960 (the feast of Annunciation) and was blessed by Rt. Rev. Andrew van den Bronk (SMA), then Bishop of Kumasi.

In the same year, the Sixth Form Arts class began with five students. In 1964, the Administration Block was built and dedicated appropriately to the "Annunciation" (for we have ''good news'' to tell). More buildings were put up to meet the school's expanding needs. In 1964, the Sixth Form Science stream was started. Past students will recall the butterfly collection with Sister Elizabeth (Mary Roch) and Sr. Philomena McGuinness, (Mary Iosagan), the delightful training in Music and Singing that left such a rich tradition, as well as the insightful Drama performance. There was also the planting of shrubs, shade trees, and general landscaping with Sr. Aideen. Today, the school has many more buildings, including a library complex.

==Community Outreach==

To attend the shortage of missionary priests and nuns, the students formed a strong lay apostolate to go to the outlying compounds to teach Catechism, prepare candidates for Baptism, and visit lapsed Christians to re-awaken their faith. Students also got an opportunity to broaden their outlook by visiting neighbouring countries.

In the early 1970s the school began admitting boys into Sixth Form. This continued until the early 1980s when the program ended due to the problem of control. {{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Alliance==
The school maintains an ongoing alliance with the [[Opoku Ware Senior High School]], popularly called ''AkataSlopsa''.

'''Standard Macedonian''' or '''Literary Macedonian'''&lt;ref&gt;Victor Freidman. "Macedonian", (2001) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-mk|Книжевен македонски јазик}} or Македонски литературен јазик)&lt;ref&gt;Transliterated, ''Kniževen makedonski jazik''. Also, "Литературен македонски јазик" (''Literaturen makedonski jazik'').&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Standard language|standard]] [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the [[Macedonian language]] and [[official language]] of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] used as a [[Literary language|written language]], in formal contexts, and for communication between different [[Isogloss|dialect areas]]. Several [[prestige dialect]]s have developed around the major urban centers of [[Skopje]], [[Bitola]], [[Veles (city)|Veles]] and [[Prilep]].

It was only in the 1940s, however, that the Macedonian language was able to be implemented, after being formally declared the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]]. The rapid pace at which the standardization process took place was in part owing to an already existing interdialect (see [[Spoken Macedonian]]). The standard language is [[Macedonian phonology|phonologically]] and [[Macedonian grammar|morphologically]] based on the central [[Western Macedonian dialects]] (in particular, the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect|Prilep-Bitola]] and [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]) with its [[lexicon]] influenced by all [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|Macedonian dialects]].

Educated speakers will usually use, or aim to use, the formal standard in public settings and in most forms of [[written language]]. Probably the best exemplars of this type of speech, though not always the case, are [[actors]], [[teachers]] and writers. A high degree of [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|social prestige]] and [[respect]] is assigned to those who correctly use the standard language in the appropriate situations. In extremely rare examples, some speakers will use the formal code exclusively in everyday conversational speech.

While acquisition of the formal code constitutes a significant part of elementary education, during which children are taught the relationship between their local dialect and the target code, the formal [[literary language]]. Most educated speakers [[Code-switching|switch]] to the colloquial register of the standard language, [[Spoken Macedonian]], when communicating in less formal circumstances, but tend to aim for more formal usage in circumstances where educated speakers are present or as a sort of "[[Ausbausprache - Abstandsprache - Dachsprache#Dachsprache|interdialect]]" in the case where the company is not exclusively local.

'''''Stavros S Niarchos''''' is a British [[brig]]-rigged [[tall ship]], now renamed "Sunset".  She was previously owned and operated by the [[Tall Ships Youth Trust]] (TSYT). She was primarily designed to provide young people with the opportunity to undertake voyages as character-building exercises, rather than pure sail-training. She was also used for adult voyages and holidays, which helped subsidise the operation of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berthon.co.uk/press-release/60m-tall-ship-stavros-s-niarchos-priced-to-sell/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
In the late 1990s the two [[schooner]]s (''[[Malcolm Miller]]'' and [[Sir Winston Churchill (schooner)|''Sir Winston Churchill'']]) then owned by the Tall Ships Youth Trust (then called the [[Sail Training Association]] (STA)) were showing their age and becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. The hulls for the two new brigs (''Stavros S Niarchos'' and her sister ship, [[Prince William (ship)|''Prince William'']]) were obtained half-completed from another project in [[Germany]]. These were transported to [[Appledore Ship Yards]] in [[Devon]], where they were modified to the TSYT's requirements, and fitted out. She was completed in January 2000.  The rig was designed by Michael Willoughby, who wrote a few comments on the overall design of the brigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Willoughby |first=Michael |title=The New Brig: Get Clued Up! |website= |url=http://www.tallship.co.uk/magazine/issue007.phtml?orderID=0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316171527/http://www.tallship.co.uk/magazine/issue007.phtml?orderID=0 |archivedate=2005-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable voyages ==
Following completion of [[sea trial]]s she was handed over to the STA at [[Avonmouth|Avonmouth Docks]]. She sailed for her maiden voyage, a training voyage for permanent and volunteer crew, on 13 February 2000. She arrived in [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] three days later.

During that trip she encountered a south westerly gale as she came round Land's End. She achieved an indicated speed through the water of {{convert|14|kn}} under lower tops'ls and fore topmast stays'l alone.

In January 2006 ''Stavros S Niarchos'' rescued the two women crew from a vessel taking part in the 2005 Atlantic Rowing race.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotsman.com/news/world/novice-sailors-rescue-atlantic-rowing-pair-1-688700&lt;/ref&gt; The rescue was made in heavy weather, with the assistance of a [[USCG]] [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] aircraft. In late 2006 TSYT Captain Darren Naggs was awarded the Thomas Gray Silver Medal of the [[Marine Society]], for exemplary seamanship during the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Warships International Fleet Review  December 2006  pp48-9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rig ==
''Stavros S Niarchos'' is a [[brig]], that is a two masted vessel with [[sail|square sails]] on both masts. She carries five [[yardarm|yards]] on each mast (moving up: [[Course (sail)|Course]], [[Topsail|Lower Topsail]], [[Topsail|Upper Topsail]], [[Topgallant sail|Topgallant]] and [[Royal (sail)|Royal]]), and a total of 18 [[sails]]. In good conditions she has managed speeds of just over {{convert|13|kn}}.

== Crew ==
''Stavros S Niarchos'' (and her sister ship, ''Prince William'') normally sail with a crew of up to 67 people. The crew consists of 6 permanent salaried crew, 11 to 13 volunteer crew and up to 48 voyage crew. The voyage crewmembers, those paying to sail on the ship, are divided into three watches (Red, White and Blue) of 16. Each of these watches has a Watch Leader from the volunteer crew. The remaining crew are assigned as follows:

'''Permanent crew:'''
* [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] (Master)
* [[Chief Mate]]
* [[Second Mate]]
* [[Chief Engineer]]
* [[Boatswain]] (Bosun)
* [[Chief Cook|Cook]]

'''Volunteer crew:'''
* [[Third Mate]]
* [[First aid|First Aid]] [[Purser]]
* 2nd Cook
* [[Messman|Assistant Cook]]
* Assistant Engineer
* 3 × Watch Leaders
* 2 × Deckhands (3 on adult voyages)
* 2 × Youth Mentors (youth voyages only)
* 2 × Supernumeraries (optional, adult voyages only)

On youth voyages the two Youth Mentors (YMs) are responsible for the various entertainment activities and competitions as well helping with any problems young people aboard may have. They are usually professionally qualified teachers or youth workers.

The 2 or 3 deckhands act as assistants to the bosun and as such are mostly concerned with the cleaning and maintenance of the ship.

In November 2011, the Tall Ships Youth Trust announced plans to sell ''Stavros S Niarchos'', its last remaining tall ship, to focus on smaller vessels. Much of this is due to the high cost of running a vessel of such size due to pilotage charges and mooring fees for a vessel over 400 tonnes.  This has become a contentious issue with the trust and its supporters where some see this as the abandonment of the tall ships for yachts within the trust.  For others this is a return to the days of ''Sir Winston Churchill'' and ''Malcolm Miller'' which as smaller vessels didn't incur these charges and perhaps had better sailing and penetration and operation within UK sailing ports and waters. Although the schooners were smaller, some say they ran a much better programme and fulfilled the mandate of the former Sail Training Association, before it became TSYT.

The ship will continue in operation until a buyer is found, which the Trust expects to take several years based on their experience of selling ''Prince William''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter |url=http://www.keepandshare.com/doc/3287458/important-letter-pdf-november-20-2011-12-05-am-354k?da=y |work=Letter from Tall Ships Youth Trust |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was sold at auction on 30 September 2017 by C.W. Kellock &amp; Co. Ltd., a London-based ship broker. It is no longer part of the Tall Ships Youth Trust fleet.  On 16 October 2017, the ship's AIS broadcast name changed to "Sunset".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunset (Ship) IMO 9222314|url=https://www.fleetmon.com/vessels/sunset_9222314_49165/|website=Fleetmon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">'''Péidú māmā''' (陪读妈妈), or '''study mamas''' are foreign women who accompany their children to [[Singapore]] while their children receive primary and secondary-level education. The study mama phenomenon began in 2000, after the Singapore Government relaxed its immigration policies to attract more foreigners. Most of the study mamas are from [[mainland China]].&lt;ref name="stw"&gt;{{cite news|title=Who owes them a living?|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]|date=2006-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore possesses records that suggest that there are at least 7,800 study mamas of various nationalities, with two-thirds of the 6,800 study mamas in Singapore in July 2005 coming from China. Of these 6,800 study mamas, only 1,000 have been issued work permits.&lt;ref name="stw" /&gt; Most working study mamas are employed in the service sector.

== Jobs ==
In an article in ''[[People's Daily]]'', it is estimated that peidu mamas require [[RMB]]¥1 million (approx [[S$]]217,000) of living and education expenses for their child to receive education from Primary 1 to Secondary 4 in Singapore.&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pconline.com.cn/pcjob/language/info/10311/248244.html|title=新加坡:中国"陪读妈妈"苦水多|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717192424/http://www.pconline.com.cn/pcjob/language/info/10311/248244.html|archivedate=2006-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Singapore Government allowed them to come to Singapore, primarily to accompany their children during their studies here.&lt;ref name="stw" /&gt; Peidu mamas are only allowed to obtain work permits after staying in Singapore for a year and are permitted to work in certain service sectors only.&lt;ref name="to"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/129342.asp|title=Study mamas in embassy protest|publisher=[[TODAYOnline]]|date=2006-07-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311164815/http://www.todayonline.com/articles/129342.asp|archivedate=2007-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government ==
The government places restriction on the employment of study mamas, arguing that their primary purpose of stay here is to take care of their children. Hence they should not be working, especially not as [[Hostess bar|hostesses]] in bars or [[pub]]s at night. They are not allowed to work at food stalls, but can work in other services industries if given permits.&lt;ref name="stw" /&gt;

==Incidents==
In October 2004, the daughter of a study mama, [[Huang Na]] went missing and was subsequently found murdered.

In June 2006, a female Chinese national who owned a [[massage parlour]], which allegedly provided sex services to clients, was stabbed to death in [[Ang Mo Kio]]. This drew public and media attention to vice-related activities at some of these massage parlours. In early July 2006, the government conducted a crackdown on illegal employment at the parlours and imposed stricter regulation on their operations. This led some peidu mamas to hold a protest outside the Chinese [[Embassy]], despite the prohibition of such gatherings in Singapore.&lt;ref name="to" /&gt;

'''''These Girls Are Missing''''' is a 1995 [[documentary film]] from directors [[Shari Robertson]] and [[Michael Camerini]] about the gender gap in education in [[Africa]]. Its world premiere was at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women.  The film grew out of an initiative by the [[FAWE]], The Forum for African Women Educationalists, with additional support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and [[UNICEF]].

The film's purpose was to address, as Robertson puts it, "the elephant in the room" about girls in school and allow for discussion of attitudes about the effect of education on African girls and their societies. It is currently used for training within the [[Peace Corps]] who, in statements, have described the film as "rich in its learning opportunities as well as being beautifully filmed."

== Synopsis ==

''"A film about men and women, about marriage... families... having babies, about tradition, and the modern world... about who goes to school in Africa... and why girls are missing." - Official tag-line.''

Every year, girls in African schools "go missing," from school classrooms. This film analyzes the stories of five schoolgirls and examines the causes and consequences of the high dropout rates among girls. The stories are told directly by Malawian and Guinean girls and their families.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/uploads/files/810ee710-87ef-4011-8786-f006a9f30c65-1995.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part I: Nadouba and Bintu in the West-African village of Gbonko, Guinea.
* Part II: Ethel and her mother, in Muluma village, Malawi.
* Part III: Taz and Patricia from elite St. Mary’s Secondary School in Zomba, Malawi.
Also presented is a group of elders from a Malinké village conversing about the issue.

==Release==

''These Girls Are Missing'' was initially commissioned by [[FAWE]], The Forum for African Women Educationalists, and premiered at the [[United Nations]]’ 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing. Because of its wide range of intended audiences, the film is available in seven languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Malinké]], [[Susu language|Susu]], Poular, Ki-Swahili and [[Chichewa]].

Since its release, the film has been distributed widely by the Ministries of Education in both [[Guinea]] and [[Malawi]], and used in focus groups and workshops promoting girls’ education. FAWE also distributed the film unto associate members in Ministries of Education in [[Zanzibar]], [[Angola]], [[Cameroon]], [[Namibia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Senegal]], [[Mauritius]], [[Seychelles]], [[Botswana]], [[São Tomé e Principe]], [[Mozambique]], [[Uganda]] and [[Ghana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epidavros.org/ss/our_work/projects/these_girls_are_missing?page=2&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has also screened at [[Cinema du Reel|Cinema du Reel, Paris]]; [[Comparative Education#Comparative and International Education Society|CIES (Comparative and International Education Society) Conference]], [[Buffalo, NY]]; [[Marymount Manhattan College]], [[New York City|NY]]; and the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]], [[Princeton University]]. It has also been screened for the [[U.S. State Department]], [[U.S. Agency for International Development]], [[Inter-American Development Bank]], [[World Council for Comparative Education Societies]] and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|U.S. National Academy of Sciences]].

==The Girls Know it==

The filmmakers also produced a shorter version of the film called '''''The Girls Know It''''', released in 1997. It is hosted, on screen, by The Honorable Aicha Bah, Minister of Education in Guinea. The film is shorter, at 47 minutes and was released in 1997. It is available in seven languages as well. This 47-minute cut is available in the same seven languages as the 60-minute film.

==Educational Use==

[[UNICEF]], [[USAID]], and the Peace Corps have made extensive use of ''These Girls Are Missing'' as a training and education tool.

==Critical reception==

The film received the Cine Golden Eagle under the Documentary Feature category&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cine.org/archives/winner-archives/pdfs/1996-CINE-Winner-Directory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and a Silver Plaque as part of the 31st annual [[Chicago International Film Festival]].

March, 1998 ''Moving Pictures Bulletin'' reviewed the film as analyzing and contrasting situations "represent[ing] a new generation who may finally break the cycle of girls in Africa forced to miss out on their education."

The '''University of French Polynesia''' ({{lang-fr|Université de la Polynésie française}}) is a [[France|French]] [[University]] located in [[Punaauia]], [[Tahiti]], [[French Polynesia]], France.

== History  ==

=== History  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upf.pf/Historique.html|title=Université de la Polynésie Française - Tahiti|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Created by a decree of May 29, 1987, the university was originally called French Pacific University and was split between two sites, one located in [[New Caledonia]] (now University of New Caledonia) and the other in Tahiti. The administrative headquarters of the university was in Papeete. Both centers have become autonomous with the Decree No. 99-445 of 31 May 1999.

The University of French Polynesia is based in Outumaoro, Punaauia, Tahiti. The number of students is growing steadily, with a significant increase of over 60% since 1999, and so has the range of course offerings.

The University of French Polynesia is often the talk of local newspapers, especially because of its proactive policy for the employability of its graduates. One can mention, among others, the Employers' Forum, the sponsorship of class valedictorians by private companies, the Public Employment Fair, the innovative teaching methods developed by the academic community.

=== Presidents ===
* Pierre Verin (1997-1999), president of the [[French Pacific University]]
* Sylvie André (2001-2005), interim director between 1999 and 2000
* Louise Peltzer (2005-2011)
* Eric Conte (2011 -)

== Organization &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upf.pf/Les-instances-universitaires.html|title=Université de la Polynésie Française - Tahiti|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
The university is headed by the President, who has authority over all the staff. He determines the policy of the institution with the assistance of the Board. As the executive authority, he prepares and implements the multi-year contract with the French Ministry of Higher Education and concludes agreements and conventions on behalf of the university. He is the chief officer of  revenue and expenditure for the university budget and responsible for maintaining order. He is elected for a four-year term by a majority of elected Board members.

Professor Eric Conte was elected President of the University of French Polynesia on June 23, 2011.

He is assisted by four vice-presidents :
# Board of Trustees: Patrick Capolsini, associate professor in computer science;
# Scientific Council: Alban Gabillon, full professor in computer science;
# Student Life: Vincent Dropsy, associate professor in economics
# Student Vice President: Andrew John; he is the spokesman of student representatives in various committees.
