      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2197">'''Alexander Hastie''' MP (1805&amp;ndash;1864) was a late 19th century Scottish Whig politician who served as [[Lord Provost of Glasgow]] from 1846 to 1848.&lt;ref&gt;http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F36433&lt;/ref&gt; He was MP for Glasgow from 1847 to 1848 and from 1852 to 1857.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/17701/alexander_hastie/glasgow&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the few people to simultaneously have been Lord Provost and MP for the same city.

He was noted as an anti-slavery activist.&lt;ref&gt;Clotel and Other Writings, William Wells Brown&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born on 24 April 1805 in [[Fife]], the son of Robert Hastie (1774-1827). The family moved to [[Glasgow]] around 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1815&lt;/ref&gt; His father was President of the Glasgow Philosophical Society.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwoods Magazine vol 21, 1827&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1822 to 1827 he lived and worked in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Men from Fife, M F Conolly&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked for the family firm of R. Hastie &amp; Co, based first at Somerville Place&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1830&lt;/ref&gt; and later at 13 John Street in Glasgow. The company traded with America and the East Indies.

In 1837 he joined Glasgow town council as a councillor. At the time of his being Lord Provost in 1846 he lived at 212 Bath Street in the Glasgow city centre.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office directory 1848&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1863 he purchased [[Luscar House]], near [[Dunfermline]] in [[Fife]].

He had an attack of [[cerebral palsy]] at home in Bath Street in January 1864. He died on 13 August 1864 at Luscar House.

==Family==

In 1852 he married Ann Napier daughter of Robert Napier of West [[Sherndon]]. They had two daughters, Isabella Napier Hastie and Jane Alexia Hastie.

In 1873 Isabella ("Ella") (1854-1919) married Thomas Charles Perceval Lefroy and became Isabella Napier Lefroy. She was an author under the name of E. N. Leigh Fry.&lt;ref&gt;The Selected Letters of Katharine Tynan&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ames Gate Lodge''' is a celebrated work by American architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson|H. H. Richardson]]. It is privately owned on an estate landscaped by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], but its north facade can be seen from the road at 135 Elm Street, [[North Easton, Massachusetts]]. In 2013, the Ames Gate Lodge was protected by a preservation easement held by Historic New England.

The lodge was designed and constructed in 1880-1881 for [[Frederick Lothrop Ames]], son of railway magnate [[Oliver Ames, Jr.]], as the northern entrance to his Langwater estate. Although Langwater dated from 1859 with 1876 additions, its northern regions had until then remained unfinished. Ames thus engaged Richardson and Olmsted in collaboration on its creation. Olmsted's landscape designs were implemented in 1886-1887.

The Gate Lodge is a remarkable synthesis of oversize stone wall, arched gate, and gatehouse building, perhaps based in part on Richardson's appreciation of the [[Central Park]] bridges designed by [[Calvert Vaux]]. It forms a long, low mass lying directly athwart the estate's entry road, which runs southward within its dominating, semicircular arch. The massive walls appear to be crude heaps of rounded boulders from the estate soil -- "cyclopean rubble" in [[Vincent Scully]]'s memorable phrase—trimmed in Longmeadow brownstone. The blocky, two-story lodge proper stands west of the arch, and originally housed the estate gardener on the lower floor with rooms for bachelor guests above. Across the arch is a long, low wing ending in a circular bay, once used for storing plants through the winter.

The lodge's public (northern) facade is relatively flat and austere; its southern facade, by contrast, is highly shaped with protrusions and a large porch featuring carvings by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]. Capping all is the lodge's prominent, hipped, reddish-tiled roof with its eyelid dormers. As [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] once wrote, "The presence of a building is in its roof, and what a roof the Ames Gate Lodge has!"

The nearby [[F. L. Ames Gardener's Cottage]] (1884–85) was also designed by Richardson, and built some {{Convert|400|ft}} east of the Gate Lodge when the gardener's family outgrew the lodge. It was later enlarged by Richardson's successors, [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]], and has subsequently been shingled and otherwise modified.

Reviewing ''Les Couleurs de la Vie'' for Kenzi+, Kenza Tazi describes the work as a collection of philosophical reflections that tell us about the different colours of life and their relation to experiences such as "self-esteem, love, the need to have objectives and to fight to reach them."&lt;ref name="Kenziplus" /&gt; She says that the book encourages optimistic and positive thought to cope with life's difficulties and to move forward, and that it is therapeutic for readers who are overwhelmed by negativity.&lt;ref name="Kenziplus" /&gt;

'''McCormick Apartments''', also known as '''Andrew Mellon Building''', '''Mellon Apartment''', or '''1785 Massachusetts Avenue Northwest''', is a landmark [[apartment building]] on [[Embassy Row]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], whose inhabitants once included [[Andrew W. Mellon]]. It will soon become home to the [[American Enterprise Institute]].

==History==
The Andrew Mellon Building was built by Stanley McCormick, heir to the International Harvester fortune, in 1915 and completed in 1917. Washington-based [[Jules Henri de Sibour]] was architect of the building. This was one of the first Washington [[apartment]] buildings for luxury living. The structure was meant to fit in with other [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] buildings in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood. The building's composition is three principal elevations, to serve as a pivot point for a residential boulevard and two street intersections. The six units it originally contained had quarters for more than forty servants. Some of the Capital's most distinguished personalities once lived here. A partial listing of these residents, from the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]], includes:
* [[Thomas F. Ryan]], 1920–1922
* [[Robert Woods Bliss]], 1920–1923
* [[Edwin T. Meredith]], 1921
* [[Andrew W. Mellon]], 1922–1937
* [[Sumner Welles]], 1921–1927
* [[Alanson B. Houghton]], 1930–1934

The millionaire industrialist Andrew Mellon is perhaps most significant of these past occupants. He was [[Secretary of the Treasury]] from 1921 to 1932. This was the longest tenure since [[Albert Gallatin]]. Mellon made this his residence shortly after taking on that role, occupying the top floor from 1922 until his death in 1937. Among his accomplishments include authoring the "[[Andrew W. Mellon#Mellon plan|Mellon Plan]]" which stimulated the economic boom of the 1920s, and founding the [[National Gallery of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1400&amp;ResourceType=Building Andrew Mellon Building, 1785 Massachusetts Avenue Northwest, Washington, District of Columbia, DC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606172855/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1400&amp;ResourceType=Building |date=June 6, 2011 }}, from [[National Historic Landmarks Program]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 Mellon paid $21 million for paintings and sculptures owned by [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Sir Joseph Duveen]], an art dealer leasing the apartment below. At the time this was the largest art transaction on record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/traveler/deals/dc.html Washington, D.C. Embassy Row Walking Tour], from [[National Geographic Traveler]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1941, the building was used for offices and eventually partitioned. The property was conveyed by deed from Katherine Dexter McCormick to the American Council on Education on March 31, 1950. Later the property was conveyed to [[The Brookings Institution]] on January 2, 1970. Finally, the building was sold to the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] on October 28, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/dc/dc0100/dc0133/data/dc0133data.pdf |title=McCormick Apartments |last=Wheeler |first=Lucy Pope |date=1978 |website=Historic American Buildings Survey |publisher=Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C. |page=3 |accessdate=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Andrew Mellon Building was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Andrew Mellon Apartment, McCormick Apartments / 1785 Massachusetts Ave. Office Bldg.,  Brookings Institution|url={{NHLS url|id=73002100}} |format=pdf|date=January 1976 |author1=Cathy A.

===2013 sale===
The National Trust put the building up for sale in mid-2009.  The organization said it had outgrown the {{convert|60000|sqft|m2}} building, and needed about {{convert|80000|sqft|m2}} of space. Real estate experts believed the structure would sell for $1,000 a square foot, or $60 million. Potential buyers considered turning it into a museum or luxury apartments again, but there were no offers at any price. After Trust president Richard Moe stepped down in early 2010 and was replaced by Stephanie Meeks, the organization's board of directors decided to pull the building off the market so that Meeks would not have to devote all her time to finding the National Trust a new home. Instead, National Trust officials said they would rehabilitate some of the structure's windows, [[HVAC]], and mechanical systems and possibly add a [[green roof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Plumb |first=Tierney |date=June 28, 2010 |title=National Trust Building Goes Off the Market After No Offers |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2010/06/28/story21.html |newspaper=Washington Business Journal |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2013, the National Trust sold the Mellon Building to the [[American Enterprise Institute]] for $36.5 million.  The Trust said it will lease space on the top two floors of the [[Watergate Complex|Watergate Office Building]]. The National Trust holds a permanent historic preservation easement that protects both the interior and exterior of the Mellon Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sernovitz |first=Daniel J. |date=June 28, 2013 |title=National Trust for Historic Preservation Lands at the Watergate |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2013/06/national-trust-for-historic.html |newspaper=Washington Business Journal |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=O'Connell |first=Jonathan |date=June 27, 2013 |title=National Trust for Historic Preservation Moving Offices to the Watergate |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-business/post/national-trust-for-historic-preservation-moving-offices-to-the-watergate/2013/06/27/b03b5e82-df60-11e2-b2d4-ea6d8f477a01_blog.html |newspaper=Washington Post |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=June 26, 2013 |title=CBRE Arranges Sale of Iconic Headquarters of National Trust for Historic Preservation |url=http://dc.citybizlist.com/article/cbre-arranges-sale-iconic-headquarters-national-trust-historic-preservation |publisher=CityBizList.com |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309084722/http://dc.citybizlist.com/article/cbre-arranges-sale-iconic-headquarters-national-trust-historic-preservation |archivedate=March 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asil Nadir''' (born 1 May 1941) is a [[Turkish Cypriot]] businessman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://famagusta-gazette.com/applause-for-asil-nadir-as-he-returns-to-work-p33943-69.htm|title=Applause for Asil Nadir as he returns to work|website=famagusta-gazette.com|access-date=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was chief executive of [[Polly Peck]], which he took over as a small textile company, growing it during the 1980s to become one of the United Kingdom's top 100 [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]]-listed companies, with interests in consumer electronics, fruit distribution and packaging. 

In 1990, Polly Peck collapsed following an investigation by the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] and charges were brought against Asil Nadir on 70 counts of false accounting and theft, which he denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/fugitive-asil-nadir-hires-top-criminal-barrister-for-defence-735342.html |title=Asil Nadir hires top criminal barrister for defence |publisher=The Independent|date=11 November 2003|accessdate=26 August 2010 | location=London | first=Saeed | last=Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1993 until 2010 Nadir lived in [[northern Cyprus]], having fled there to escape a trial in the UK. He remained a fugitive from British justice until 26 August 2010, when he returned to London to face trial. His trial commenced at the [[Old Bailey]] on 3 September 2010, on 13 [[specimen charges]] of false accounting and theft totalling £34m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11093271 |title=Fugitive Polly Peck tycoon Asil Nadir returns to UK |publisher=BBC News|date=26 August 2010|accessdate=26 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100826051340/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11093271| archivedate= 26 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found guilty of 10 counts of theft totalling £29m and on 23 August 2012 was sentenced to 10 years in prison.&lt;ref name="Jailed"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19352531 |title=Asil Nadir jailed for 10 years for Polly Peck thefts|publisher=BBC News|date=22 August 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Nadir was born in 1941 in Lefka, Cyprus. His father, Irfan Nadir, was a local businessman and police constable in the colonial police department. When he was six years old he began selling newspapers, and he moved with his family to London in the 1950s when his father expanded the family clothing business from a base in the [[East End of London]].&lt;ref name=GuardProf26Aug&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/26/asil-nadir|title=Profile: Asil Nadir's finances have fascinated media for 40 years|author=Owen Bowcott|publisher=The Guardian|date=26 August 2010|accessdate=26 August 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100829055107/http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/aug/26/asil-nadir| archivedate= 29 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Nadir studied economics at [[Istanbul University]], but returned to Cyprus before graduation to set up a clothing business. He returned to London in the 1960s, but after the invasion by Turkey of [[northern Cyprus]] in 1974, accepted the appeal of the authorities to bolster the new region economically. The Turkish occupation enabled him to take over a Greek-Cypriot owned clothing factory in [[Nicosia]], where he greatly expanded exports to the Middle East.&lt;ref name=GuardProf26Aug/&gt;

===Polly Peck===
{{main article|Polly Peck}}
In the late 1970s he purchased a small British textile company, [[Polly Peck]], which he turned into a portfolio company with which to make various [[corporate raiding]] purchases in clothing, fruit packing and later consumer electronics. Through this he came to prominence in the 1980s as a [[tycoon]] and the CEO of an organisation by then with over 24,000 shareholders and interests ranging from produce to electronics. Within a decade, Nadir had built Peck from almost nothing into a member of the [[FTSE 100]].

His alleged criminal mismanagement led to its collapse in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Martin | last=Baker | author2= | title=Indicted Polly Peck Chief Finds No Place Like Home | date= 6 May 1993 | publisher= | url =http://www.iht.com/articles/1993/05/06/poll_0.php | work =[[International Herald Tribune]] | accessdate = 14 June 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escape to northern Cyprus==
Nadir was prosecuted on various counts of theft and fraud, amounting to 66 charges, but failed to appear at the trial in 1993 having travelled to the unrecognised [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], which has no [[extradition treaty]] with the United Kingdom, where he resided until 2010. Although a UK arrest warrant was subsequently issued for his breach of bail, it was not valid due to procedural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams |first=Stephen |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/cyprus/7918866/Judge-grants-Polly-Pecks-Asil-Nadir-bail.html |title=Judge grants Polly Peck's Asil Nadir bail |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=30 July 2010|accessdate=26 August 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100802022227/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/cyprus/7918866/Judge-grants-Polly-Pecks-Asil-Nadir-bail.html| archivedate= 2 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2003 interview with the [[BBC]], Nadir vowed to return to the UK to attempt to clear his name. However, he said that he was fearful of the consequences to his health and refused to go back until the British government agreed to give him bail and not remand him in prison until his trial. On 26 August 2010, having provided bail of £250,000 and secured an agreement to not be remanded in prison until his trial, he returned to the UK.&lt;ref name=FugiReturns&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11093271|title=Fugitive Polly Peck tycoon Asil Nadir returns to UK|date=26 August 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100826051340/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11093271| archivedate= 26 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Dimond (pilot)|Peter Dimond]], the pilot who flew Nadir out of the UK from [[Compton Abbas Airfield]] in a twin-engined private plane, was jailed for two years in August 1998 for committing an act intended to pervert the course of justice, but he was freed by the [[Court of Appeal]] in January 1999 when it quashed the conviction after it was discovered that Nadir was not technically on bail at the time of his escape as his bail had lapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/255831.stm|title='Angry' Asil Nadir pilot freed |date=15 January 1999|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==

Nadir ran a business in northern Cyprus called the Kıbrıs Media Group, which ''inter alia'' publishes the newspaper ''Kıbrıs'' (Turkish for 'Cyprus') and the English language weekly ''[[Cyprus Today]]''. It also owns a radio and TV station. Nadir's outlets published articles critical of the [[Republican Turkish Party]]/[[Reform Party (Northern Cyprus)|Reform Party]] coalition government in the run-up to the April 2009 general election and actively supported the then opposition [[National Unity Party (Northern Cyprus)|National Unity Party]] and [[Democratic Party (Northern Cyprus)|Democratic Party]]. On 12 March 2009 Kıbrıs Media Group was suddenly presented with a tax demand in the amount of 11 million Turkish Lira ($6.3 million) payable the following day, on pain of the sequestration of its assets. Leading opposition politicians branded this action as an attempt to gag the free media. The edition of 14 March 2009 of ''Cyprus Today'' appeared as usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_world_1_14/03/2009_105506 |title=Media tycoon Asil Nadir cries foul |publisher=Kathimerini |date=14 March 2009 |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministers subsequently awarded him a multimillion-euro contract to operate [[Lefkoniko Airport]] in northern Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/09/14/nadir-back-business-lefkoniko-airport-contract/ |title=Nadir wins Lefkoniko airport contract |publisher=Cyprus Mail |date=19 June 2010 |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to UK==
On 30 July 2010 it was reported that a British judge had granted Nadir bail, which it was said would pave the way for him to return to the UK to face trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10819293 |title=Fugitive Asil Nadir to return to the UK to stand trial |publisher=BBC News|date=30 July 2010|accessdate=26 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100813141943/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10819293| archivedate= 13 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August 2010, Nadir returned to the UK with his wife Nur in a private Boeing 737 aircraft, leased from Onur Airlines,&lt;ref name=FugiReturns/&gt;&lt;ref name=TycoonReturns&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7965040/Polly-Peck-tycoon-Asil-Nadir-returns-to-Britain-to-face-fraud-charges.html|title=Polly Peck tycoon Asil Nadir returns to Britain to face fraud charges|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 August 2010 | location=London | first=Heidi | last=Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt; to face trial.  His bail conditions included the £250,000 bail surety already paid to the court, surrendering his passport, wearing an electronic tag, reporting to a police station once a week, and being prohibited from going near any airport.&lt;ref name=FugiReturns/&gt; He appeared at the [[Old Bailey]] on 3 September 2010 to comply with bail conditions.&lt;ref name=TycoonReturns/&gt; Nadir stayed in a £20,000-a-month rented house.&lt;ref name=TycoonReturns/&gt; Owing to the complexity of the allegations, his trial did not begin until 23 January 2012.&lt;ref name=QandA&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11095364|title=Q&amp;A: Asil Nadir|publisher=BBC News|date=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 August 2012, Asil Nadir was found guilty on ten counts of theft of nearly £29m from Polly Peck. The jury found him not guilty on three counts. The jury had been advised at the start of the trial that the 13 were specimen charges and the overall amount allegedly stolen was about £146m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9795df1a-ec4a-11e1-a91c-00144feab49a.html#ixzz24IA2w2PS |title=Asil Nadir guilty of £29m Polly Peck theft |work=Financial Times |date=22 August 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19352531 |title=Asil Nadir jailed for 10 years for Polly Peck thefts |publisher=BBC |date=23 August 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transferred to Turkey==

In April 2016, Asil Nadir was transferred to a [[Turkey|Turkish]] prison. A [[Ministry of Justice]] spokesman said: "It is right that foreign criminals are properly punished but not at the expense of British taxpayers. This government is committed to removing foreign criminals to their own countries. Since Asil Nadir has now repaid the £2 million he owed the [[Legal Aid Agency]], plus £5 million in compensation he paid earlier, arrangements were made with the Turkish government for his removal as part of our [[Prisoner Transfer Agreement]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36107048|title=Jailed tycoon Asil Nadir transferred to Turkish prison|publisher=BBC News|date=21 April 2016|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Nadir was born to a Turkish Cypriot family. He is the father of four children, one by his mistress when aged 19, two by his first wife and one by a former mistress.&lt;ref name=Anything&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1291383/Why-fugitive-Asil-Nadir-wife-43-years-junior-ANYTHING-return-Britain.html#ixzz0xil3CGCo |title=Why fugitive Asil Nadir will do ANYTHING to return to Britain|publisher=Mail Online|date=2 July 2010 | location=London | first=Tom | last=Rawstorne}}

&lt;/ref&gt;  Nadir was listed at 36th on the ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]'' in 1990.&lt;ref name=QandA/&gt;

It also provides audit services for [[newspapers]], [[web sites]], events, email newsletters, digital magazines and other advertiser-supported media produced by its members. The company is a [[not-for-profit]], ([[501(c)(6)]] organization, and is the largest auditor of media in the world in terms of membership,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} which consists of media owners, marketer companies and advertising agencies. BPA is similar to [[Alliance for Audited Media]], providing independent, third-party verified data that media owners provide to media buyers and advertisers.

The company operate the "iCompli" brand, documenting compliance to defined standards. iCompli verifies adherence to the recommended guidelines of industry bodies{{which|date=December 2014}} and government regulations{{which|date=December 2014}}, as well as self-declared or internal policies and controls{{which|date=December 2014}}.

== History ==
In 1931, Controlled Circulation Audit Inc (CCA) opened in [[New York City]]. Their first audit, ''Drug Topics'', was completed in September of that year.

In 1946, they became the first firm to equally audit titles that practiced [[Magazine#Paid_circulation|paid circulation]], non-paid circulation, or a combination thereof. The first BPA audit to report paid and controlled circulation on single report was released in 1953.

In 1954, the CCA changed its name to BPA, which at the time stood for Business Publications Audit of Circulation, Inc. In the same year that they opened their first satellite office in [[Chicago, Illinois]].

In 1970 BPA completed its first audit of a European title, ''Vision''. In 1976, the Supplementary Audit of product usage and buying influence was introduced. This report allowed publishers to provide advertisers with [[demographics]] of which products their readers were currently using, and their role in making future purchases.

In 1980, the first audit of pass-along individuals was conducted for ''[[Architectural Record]]''. This report used surveys to qualified subscribers to determine how many additional individuals also read their copy of the publication.

In 1985, BPA opened their West Coast office in [[Los Angeles, California]].

By 1990, the count of business publication members reached 1,200 members. In 1995, BPA was changed to BPA International with the addition of their first overseas office in London. In 1998, the [[Canadian Circulations Audit Board]] (CCAB) merged with BPA International. With the addition of their audited titles, total media owner membership exceeded 2,500 members and 500 employees.

BPA changed the business model they had operated under for the previous seventy years and replaced on-site audits at clients' offices with clients shipping them "boxed" audits of materials required. This was now possible since the majority of clients records were being stored electronically and accessible via the internet. By 2002, BPA downsized its satellite offices in the US and moved its headquarters to [[Shelton, Connecticut]]. By 2003, more than 70% of all US audits were "boxed" and sent to Connecticut.

In 2004, [[BPA International]] changed its name to BPA Worldwide. This coincided with the opening of an office in Beijing, China. In 2006, they opened an office in [[Dubai Media City]].

BPA launched its Brand Report product in 2008. The statement allows media owners to report all of their audience "touch points" on a single statement.

In 2012, BPA opened a branch office in [[Shenzhen]], [[Guangdong Province]] in China. BPA opened another office in [[Hong Kong]] in March 2001. 

BPA Worldwide currently performs nearly 2,600 audits in over 20 countries.

The BPA Media Exchange was launched in 2017.

A '''Bachelor of Business''' ('''BBus, BBus (Major)''') is a three-year undergraduate business [[Bachelor's degree|degree]] offered by traditional and newer universities from the post-Dawkins era in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and [[Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dbs.ie/course/full-time-undergraduate/full-time-undergraduate-bachelor-of-business|title=Full-time Undergraduate - Bachelor of Business|website=www.dbs.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is similar in format and structure to a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] (BCom).

In Australia, it was traditionally awarded by former non-university tertiary institutions which include institutes of technologies, such as [[Queensland University of Technology]], [[RMIT University]] and the [[University of Technology, Sydney]]. Some former Institute of Technologies and Colleges such as Ballarat College of Advanced Education ([[University of Ballarat]]), Swinburne Institute of Technology ([[Swinburne University]]) the South Australia Institute of Technology ([[University of South Australia]]) and the Western Australia Institute of Technology ([[Curtin University of Technology]]) have renamed their Bachelor of Business programs to Bachelor of Commerce after achieving university status.

Many universities such as [[Monash University]] and the [[University of Queensland]] are offering Bachelor of Business degrees as a way to further specialise students study needs while other universities such as [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[University of Tasmania]], [[James Cook University]], [[Griffith University]] and [[La Trobe University]] have replaced many of their traditional general Commerce programs with Business programs.  Within Australia, Bachelor of Business degrees are as common as Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Economics degrees.

In Ireland this award can also be offered as an honours degree '''B Business (Hons)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dorset-college.ie/course/131/bachelor-of-business-honours-in-international-business|title=HETAC/QQI Bachelor of Business in International Business Level 8 - Dorset College Dublin|website=www.dorset-college.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a further one year study than the ordinary level Bachelor degree.

Examples of such include:

'''Bayer AG''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|.|ər|,_|ˈ|b|aɪ|.|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈbaɪɐ|lang}}) is a [[Germany|German]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]] and [[life sciences]] company. Headquartered in [[Leverkusen]], where its illuminated corporate logo, the Bayer cross, is a landmark, Bayer's areas of business include human and veterinary pharmaceuticals; consumer healthcare products; agricultural chemicals and biotechnology products; and high-value [[polymers]]. The company is a component of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.boerse-frankfurt.de/index/constituents/Euro_Stoxx_50#Constituents|title=Euro Stoxx 50, Börse Frankfurt (Frankfurt Stock Exchange)|publisher=Deutsche Boerse|access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Werner Baumann]] has been CEO since 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thomas |first1=Natalie |title=Bayer confirms Werner Baumann as new chief |url=https://www.ft.com/content/33118c7f-c1af-3ea0-8eaf-134a0530c04f |work=Financial Times |date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in [[Barmen]] in 1863 as a [[Dye|dyestuffs]] factory, Bayer's first and best-known product was [[aspirin]]. In 1898 Bayer [[trademarked]] the name ''[[heroin]]'' for the drug diacetylmorphine and marketed it as a cough suppressant and non-addictive substitute for [[morphine]] until 1910. Bayer also introduced [[phenobarbital]]; [[prontosil]], the first widely used antibiotic and the subject of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine; the antibiotic Cipro ([[ciprofloxacin]]); and Yaz ([[drospirenone]]) [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pills]].

In 1925 Bayer was one of six chemical companies that merged to form [[IG Farben]],{{sfn|Tammen|1978|p=195}} the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company. The [[Allied Control Council]] seized IG Farben after [[World War II]],{{efn|name=seized}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Law No. 9 |url=http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/PropControl/reference/history.propcontrol.i0039.pdf |publisher=Allied Control Council|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922015412/http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/PropControl/reference/history.propcontrol.i0039.pdf|archive-date=22 September 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of its role in the [[Nazi]] war effort and involvement in [[the Holocaust]], which included using slave labour from concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|2001|pp=xxi–xxii}}; {{harvnb|Dickerman|2017|p=440}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was split into its six constituent companies in 1951, then split again into three: BASF, Bayer and Hoechst.{{sfn|Hayes|2001|p=xxii}}&lt;ref name=Schneibel19Aug2011&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dw.com/en/stock-of-former-nazi-chemicals-giant-to-be-delisted/a-15327052| first=Gerhard|last=Schneibel| title=Stock of former Nazi chemicals giant to be delisted|work=Deutsche Welle| date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer played a key role in the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] in post-war [[West Germany]], quickly regaining its position as one of the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical corporations. In 2006 the company acquired [[Schering AG|Schering]], in 2014 it acquired [[Merck &amp; Co.]]'s consumer business, with brands such as Claritin, Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's, and in 2018 it acquired [[Monsanto]], a leading producer of genetically engineered crops, for $63 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Neate |first1=Rupert |title=Monsanto to ditch its infamous name after sale to Bayer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/04/monsanto-to-ditch-its-infamous-name-after-sale-to-bayer |work=The Guardian |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayer CropScience develops [[genetically modified crops]] and [[pesticides]].

==Early history==
===Foundation===
[[File:Farbenfabrik vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Comp 1908.jpg|left|thumb|Share of Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Comp in Elberfeld, issued 1 May 1908]]

Bayer AG was founded as a [[Dye|dyestuffs]] factory in 1863 in [[Barmen]] (later part of [[Wuppertal]]), Germany, by [[Friedrich Bayer]] and his partner, Johann Friedrich Weskott, a master dyer.{{sfn|Lewis|Zitzlsperger|2016|p=92}} Bayer was responsible for the commercial tasks. [[Fuchsine]] and [[aniline]] became the company's most important products.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The headquarters and most production facilities moved from Barmen to a larger area in [[Elberfeld]] in 1866. Friedrich Bayer (1851–1920), son of the company’s founder, was a chemist and joined the company in 1873. After the death of his father in 1880, the company became a joint-stock company, Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayern &amp; Co, also known as Elberfelder Farbenfabriken.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[File:Bayer-Kreuz.jpg|thumb|upright|Bayer cross, [[Leverkusen]]]]
A further expansion in Elberfeld was impossible, so the company moved to the village Wiesdorf at Rhein and settled in the area of the [[alizarin]] producer [[Carl Leverkus|Leverkus and Sons]]. A new city, [[Leverkusen]], was founded there in 1930 and became home to Bayer AG's headquarters. The company's corporate logo, the Bayer cross, was introduced in 1904, consisting of the word ''BAYER'' written vertically and horizontally, sharing the ''Y'' and enclosed in a circle.{{sfn|Sánchez-Serrano|2011|p=51}} An illuminated version of the logo is a landmark in Leverkusen.&lt;ref&gt;Europe Tourism. 5 March 2015 [http://europetourism.ga/category/landmarks/ landmarks Landmarks: Cologne: Nearby Attractions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aspirin===
[[File:Aspirin-Fläschchen.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bottle of Bayer aspirin, 1899]]
Bayer's first major product was [[acetylsalicylic acid]]—first described by French chemist [[Charles Frederic Gerhardt]] in 1853{{sfn|Schrör|2016|p=12}}—a modification of [[salicylic acid]] or [[salicin]], a [[folk remedy]] found in the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of the [[willow]] plant.{{sfn|Schrör|2016|p=8}}&lt;ref name=Mahdi2006/&gt; By 1899 Bayer's trademark [[Aspirin]] was registered worldwide for Bayer's brand of acetylsalicylic acid, but it lost its trademark status in the United States, France and the United Kingdom after the confiscation of Bayer's US assets and trademarks during [[World War I]] by the United States, and because of the subsequent widespread usage of the word.&lt;ref name=Tulett28May2014/&gt;

The term ''aspirin'' continued to be used in the US, UK and France for all brands of the drug,&lt;ref name=Tulett28May2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27026704|title='Genericide': Brands destroyed by their own success|first=Simon|last=Tulett|date=28 May 2014|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is still a registered trademark of Bayer in over 80 countries, including Canada, Mexico, Germany and Switzerland. As of 2011 approximately 40,000 tons of aspirin were produced each year and 10–20 billion tablets consumed in the United States alone for prevention of cardiovascular events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fuster|first1=Valentin|last2=Sweeny|first2=Joseph M. |title=Aspirin: A Historical and Contemporary Therapeutic Overview |journal=Circulation |volume=123 |issue=7 |pages=768–778 |date=22 February 2011 |pmid=21343593 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.963843 |url=https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.963843}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]], the most important medications needed in a basic [[health system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1 |publisher=World Health Organization |date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an unresolved controversy over the roles played by Bayer scientists in the development of aspirin. [[Arthur Eichengrün]], a Bayer chemist, said he was the first to discover an aspirin formulation that did not have the unpleasant [[adverse effect|side effects]] of [[nausea]] and [[gastric pain]]. He also said he had invented the name ''aspirin'' and was the first person to use the new formulation to test its safety and efficacy. Bayer contends that aspirin was discovered by [[Felix Hoffmann]] to help his father, who had [[arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Felix Hoffmann ist der "Vater" des Aspirin|date=September 1999|publisher=Bayer AG, courtesy of LaHave Media Services Limited|url=http://pressearchiv-kubitschek.www.de/pharma-presse/presseerklaerungen/texte/pharma_medikamente/bayer/bayer_110999.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928132933/http://pressearchiv-kubitschek.www.de/pharma-presse/presseerklaerungen/texte/pharma_medikamente/bayer/bayer_110999.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various sources support the conflicting claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|date=1999|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|url=http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/1999/annconf99press3.pdf|title=Jewish Scientist's Claim to Discover Aspirin Denied by Nazis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050528215006/http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/1999/annconf99press3.pdf|archive-date=28 May 2005|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sneader&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sneader, Walter|date=23 December 2000|title=The discovery of aspirin: a reappraisal|journal=BMJ|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/321/7276/1591|volume=321 |issue=7276 |pages=1591–1594 |year=2000 |pmid=11124191 |pmc=1119266 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most mainstream historians attribute the invention of aspirin to Hoffmann and/or Eichengrün.&lt;ref name=Sneader/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mahdi2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mahdi|first1=J.G.| last2=Mahdi|first2=A.J.|last3=Mahdi|first3=A.J.|last4=Bowen|first4=I.D. |title=The historical analysis of aspirin discovery, its relation to the willow tree and antiproliferative and anticancer potential |journal=Cell Proliferation |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=147–155 |date=April 2006  |pmid=16542349 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00377.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heroin===
[[File:Bayer Heroin bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|Bayer Heroin bottle]]
[[Heroin]] (diacetylmorphine), now illegal as an addictive drug, was introduced as a non-addictive substitute for morphine,&lt;ref name=TimesUnion&gt;Moore, Deborah (24 August 2014). [http://www.timesunion.com/518life/article/Heroin-A-brief-history-of-unintended-consequences-5705610.php "Heroin: A brief history of unintended consequences"]. ''Times Union''.&lt;/ref&gt; and trademarked and marketed by Bayer from 1898 to 1910 as a cough suppressant and over-the-counter treatment for other common ailments, including pneumonia and tuberculosis.{{sfn|Fernandez|Libby|2011|p=22}} Bayer scientists were not the first to make heroin, but the company led the way in commercializing it.&lt;ref name="CHFBio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Felix Hoffmann|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/felix-hoffmann|website=Science History Institute|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heroin'' was a Bayer trademark until after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards Jim (17 November 2011).

''Business Insider''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phenobarbital===
In 1903 Bayer licensed the patent for the hypnotic drug [[diethylbarbituric acid]] from its inventors Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering. It was marketed under the trade name Veronal as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action at Bayer led to the discovery of [[phenobarbital]] in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912. Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of epilepsy through the 1970s, and as of 2014 it remains on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications.&lt;ref name="Yasiry Z, Shorvon SD 26–39"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yasiry Z, Shorvon SD |title=How phenobarbital revolutionized epilepsy therapy: the story of phenobarbital therapy in epilepsy in the last 100 years |journal=Epilepsia |volume=53 Suppl 8 |issue= |pages=26–39 |date=December 2012  |pmid=23205960 |doi=10.1111/epi.12026 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="López-Muñoz F, Ucha-Udabe R, Alamo C 329–43"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=López-Muñoz F, Ucha-Udabe R, Alamo C |title=The history of barbiturates a century after their clinical introduction |journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=329–343 |date=December 2005 |pmid=18568113 |pmc=2424120 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
[[File:BayerHeroin1911.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Bayer advertisement, 1911]]
During [[World War I]] (1914–1918), Bayer's assets, including the rights to its name and trademarks, were confiscated in the United States, Canada and several other countries.&lt;ref name="bayer1"/&gt; In the United States and Canada, Bayer's assets and trademarks, including the well-known Bayer cross, were acquired by [[Sterling Drug]], a predecessor of [[Sterling Winthrop]] and were not reclaimed until 1994.

In 1916 Bayer scientists discovered [[suramin]], an anti-[[trypanosomes|parasite]] drug that is still sold by Bayer under the brand name Germanin. The formula of suramin was kept secret by Bayer for commercial reasons, but it was elucidated and published in 1924 by [[Ernest Fourneau]] and his team at the [[Pasteur Institute]].{{sfn|Sneader|2005|pp=378–379}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fourneau | first1 = E. | last2 = Th | last3 = Vallée | first3 = J. | year = 1924 | title = Sur une nouvelle série de médicaments trypanocides | url = | journal = Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences | volume = 178 | issue = | page = 675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO Model List of EssentialMedicines|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/93142/1/EML_18_eng.pdf?ua=1|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IG Farben merger==
===Research===
In 1925 Bayer became part of [[IG Farben]], a German conglomerate formed from the merger of six chemical companies: [[BASF]], [[Bayer AG|Bayer]], [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] (including [[Cassella Farbwerke Mainkur Aktiengesellschaft|Cassella]] and Chemische Fabrik Kalle), [[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa]], Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron, and [[Weiler-ter-Meer|Chemische Fabrik vorm. Weiler Ter Meer]].{{sfn|Tammen|1978|p=195}} In the 1930s [[Gerhard Domagk]], director of Bayer's Institute of Pathology and Bacteriology, working with chemists Fritz Mietzsch and Joseph Klarer, discovered [[prontosil]], the first commercially available antibacterial drug.{{sfn|Vardanyan|Hruby|2016|p=645}} The discovery and development of this first [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] drug opened a new era in medicine.{{sfn|Hager|2006}}{{page needed|date=September 2018}} Domagk won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1939 "for the discovery of the antibacterial effects of prontosil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gerhard Domagk |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1939/domagk/biographical/ |publisher=Nobel Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was forced by the [[Nazi Party]] to relinquish the reward; German citizens had been forbidden from accepting Nobel prizes since the Nobel committee had awarded the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize to a German pacifist, [[Carl von Ossietzky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gerhard Domagk |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/gerhard-domagk |publisher=Science History Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531170910/https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/gerhard-domagk |archivedate=31 May 2018 |date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II and the Holocaust===
{{further|Forced labour under German rule during World War II|IG Farben Trial}}

===Overview===
In 1953 Bayer brought the first neuroleptic ([[chlorpromazine]]) onto the German market.{{sfn|Bangen|1992}}{{page needed|date=September 2018}} In the 1960s Bayer introduced a pregnancy test, [[Primodos]], that consisted of two pills that contained [[norethisterone]] (as acetate) and [[ethinylestradiol]]. It detected pregnancy by inducing [[menstruation]] in women who were not pregnant; the presence or absence of menstrual bleeding was then used to determine whether the user was pregnant. The test became the subject of controversy when it was blamed for [[birth defect]]s, and it was withdrawn from the market in the mid-1970s. Litigation in the 1980s ended inconclusively. A review of the matter by the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] in 2014 assessed the studies performed to date and found the evidence for adverse effects to be inconclusive.&lt;ref name=MHRAreview2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/comms-ic/documents/websiteresources/con404471.pdf|title=Assessment of historical evidence on Primodos and congenital malformations – a synopsis|publisher=Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency|date=2014|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alka-Seltzer Ged Handelsmerk.JPG|thumb|Bayer has owned [[Alka-Seltzer]] since 1978.]]
In 1978 Bayer purchased [[Miles Laboratories]] and its subsidiaries Miles Canada and [[Cutter Laboratories]], acquiring along with them a variety of product lines including [[Alka-Seltzer]], [[Flintstones chewable vitamins|Flintstones vitamins]] and [[One A Day|One-A-Day]] vitamins, and Cutter [[insect repellent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/adualtrusttrans02cuttrich/adualtrusttrans02cuttrich_djvu.txt "Cutter Laboratories: 1897–1972. A Dual Trust"]. The Bancroft Library, University of California/Berkeley, Regional Oral History Office, transcript 1972–1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the purchase of Cutter, Bayer acquired Cutter's [[Factor VIII]] business. Factor VIII, a clotting agent used to treat [[hemophilia]], was produced, at the time, by processing donated blood. In the [[History of HIV/AIDS#1981: From GRID to AIDS|early days of the AIDS epidemic]], people with hemophilia were found to have higher rates of AIDS, and by 1983 the CDC had identified [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|contaminated blood products]] as a source of infection. According to the ''New York Times'', this was "one of the worst drug-related medical disasters in history". Companies, including Bayer, developed new ways to treat donated blood with heat to decontaminate it, and these new products were introduced early in 1984. In 1997 Bayer and the other three makers of such blood products agreed to pay $660 million to settle cases on behalf of more than 6,000 hemophiliacs infected in United States. But in 2003 documents emerged showing that Cutter had continued to sell unheated blood products in markets outside the US until 1985, including in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and Argentina, to offload a product they were unable to sell in Europe and the US; they also continued manufacturing the unheated product for several months. Bayer said it did this because some countries were doubtful about the efficacy of the new product.&lt;ref name = NYTimes2003&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/22/business/2-paths-of-bayer-drug-in-80-s-riskier-one-steered-overseas.html | title = 2 Paths of Bayer Drug in 80's: Riskier One Steered Overseas | last1=Bogdanich|first1=Walt|authorlink1=Walt Bogdanich|last2=Koli|first2=Eric|authorlink2=|work=The New York Times |date=19 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer has been involved in other controversies regarding its drug products. In the late 1990s it introduced a [[statin]] drug, Baycol ([[cerivastatin]]), but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. The side effect was [[rhabdomyolysis]], causing [[renal failure]], which occurred with a tenfold greater frequency in patients treated with Baycol in comparison to those prescribed alternate medications of the statin class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Spin off of Covestro===
In September 2015 Bayer spun out its $12.3 billion materials science division into a separate, publicly traded company called [[Covestro]] in which it retained about a 70% interest.&lt;ref name="WSJCovestro2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, Joyce (1 September 2015).

''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''.&lt;/ref&gt; Bayer spun out the division because it had relatively low profit margins compared to its life science divisions (10.2%, compared with 24.9% for the agriculture business and 27.5% for healthcare) and because the business required high levels of investment to maintain its growth, and to more clearly focus its efforts and identity in the life sciences.&lt;ref name=WSJCovestro2015&gt;Alessi, Christopher (1 September 2015).

==Corporate structure==
In 2003, to separate operational and strategic managements, Bayer AG was reorganized into a [[holding company]]. The group's core businesses were transformed into limited companies, each controlled by Bayer [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]. These companies were: Bayer CropScience AG; Bayer HealthCare AG; [[Bayer MaterialScience|Bayer MaterialScience AG]] and Bayer Chemicals AG, and the three service limited companies Bayer Technology Services [[GmbH]], Bayer Business Services GmbH and Bayer Industry Services GmbH &amp; Co. OHG. In 2016, the company began a second restructuring with the aim of allowing it to transition to a [[life sciences]] based company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manufacturingchemist.com/news/article_page/Bayer_organises_its_Life_Science_businesses_into_three_divisions_Pharmaceuticals_Consumer_Health_and_Crop_Science/112053|title=Bayer organises its Life Science businesses into three divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Consumer Health and Crop Science|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By divesting its Chemicals division in 2004 and with the aim of off-loading its Materials division by mid-2016, Bayer will be left with the four core units, as depicted below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bayer.com/en/profile-and-organization.aspx | title=Names, Facts, Figures about Bayer | date=31 December 2015 | publisher=Bayer | accessdate=7 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-aligns-organization-with-Life-Science-businesses|title=Bayer aligns organization with Life Science businesses - Bayer News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bayer CropScience===
Bayer CropScience has products in crop protection (i.e. [[pesticides]]), nonagricultural [[pest (animal)|pest]] control, [[seeds]] and plant [[biotechnology]]. In addition to conventional agrochemical business, it is involved in [[Genetically modified food|genetic engineering of food]].&lt;ref name="AR2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.annualreport2010.bayer.com/en/bayer-annual-report-2010.pdfx |title=Annual Report 2010 |accessdate=1 March 2011 |publisher=Bayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Bayer AG acquired Aventis (now part of [[Sanofi]]) CropScience and fused it with their own agrochemicals division (Bayer Pflanzenschutz or "Crop Protection") to form Bayer CropScience; the Belgian biotech company [[Plant Genetic Systems]] became part of Bayer through the Aventis acquisition.&lt;ref name="AR2010" /&gt;  Also in 2002, Bayer AG acquired the Dutch seed company Nunhems, which at the time was one of the world's top five seed companies.&lt;ref&gt;Fruitnet. 4 April 2014 [http://www.fruitnet.com/americafruit/article/161152/bayer-announces-nunhems-rebranding Bayer Cropscience rebrands Nunhems]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ram HH and Yadava, R. Genetic Resources and Seed Enterprises: Management and Policies. New India Publishing, 2007 {{ISBN|9788189422653}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|270}} In 2006, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that Bayer CropScience's LibertyLink genetically modified rice had contaminated the U.S. rice supply. Shortly after the public learned of the contamination, the E.U. banned imports of U.S. long-grain rice and the futures price plunged. In April 2010, a Lonoke County, Arkansas jury awarded a dozen farmers $48 million. The case is currently on appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. On 1 July 2011 Bayer CropScience agreed to a global settlement for up to $750 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bloomberg|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/business/02rice.html|newspaper=The New York Times | title=Bayer Settles With Farmers Over Modified Rice Seeds|date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, the firm announced plans to invest $1 billion in the [[United States]] between 2013 and 2016.  A Bayer spokesperson said that the largest investments will be made to expand the production of its herbicide Liberty.  Liberty is an alternative to Monsanto's product, [[Glyphosate|Roundup]], which are both used to kill weeds.

[[Reuters]], 4 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, as part of the wholesale corporate restructuring, Bayer CropScience became one of the three major divisions of Bayer AG, reporting directly to the head of the division, [[Liam Condon]].&lt;ref&gt;Patel, Nikhil (30 September 2015).

Bayer CropScience Limited is the Indian subsidiary of Bayer AG. It is listed on the Indian [[stock exchanges]] viz. the [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] &amp; [[National Stock Exchange of India]] and has a [[market capitalization]] of $2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/pesticides-agro-chemicals/bayercropscience/BC12|title=Bayer CropScience|work=moneycontrol.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayer BioScience, headquartered in [[Hyderabad, India]] has about 400 employees, and has research, production and an extensive sales network spread across [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayergroupindia.com/bio_science.html Bayer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104000201/http://www.bayergroupindia.com/bio_science.html |date=4 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/agri-biz/bayer-launches-multicrop-breeding-station-in-hyderabad/article5200943.ece|title=Bayer launches multi-crop breeding station in Hyderabad|author=Our Bureau|work=The Hindu Business Line}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bayer Consumer Health===
Before the 2016 restructuring, Bayer HealthCare comprises a further four subdivisions: Bayer Schering Pharma, Bayer Consumer Care, Bayer Animal Health and Bayer Medical Care.&lt;ref name="AR2010" /&gt; As part of the corporate restructuring, Animal Health was moved into its own business unit, leaving the division with the following categories; Allergy, Analgesics, Cardiovascular Risk Prevention, Cough &amp; Cold, Dermatology, Foot Care, Gastrointestinals, Nutritionals and Sun Care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borderless.net/bayer-restructures-appoints-new-board-members/|title=Bayer restructures, appoints new board members - Borderless for leaders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayer Consumer Care manages Bayer's OTC medicines portfolio. Key products include analgesics such as Bayer Aspirin and Aleve, food supplements [[Redoxon]] and [[Berocca]], and skincare products Bepanthen and Bepanthol.&lt;ref name="AR2010" /&gt; Women's healthcare is an example of a General Medicine business unit. Bayer Pharma produces the birth control pills [[drospirenone|Yaz]] and [[Yasmin (drug)|Yasmin]].

In 1904, the company founded the sports club TuS 04 ("Turn- und Spielverein der Farbenfabriken vorm. Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co."), later SV Bayer 04 ("Sportvereinigung Bayer 04 Leverkusen"), finally becoming [[TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen]] ("Turn- und Sportverein") in 1984, generally, however, known simply as [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]]. The club is best known for its football team, but has been involved in many other sports, including athletics, fencing, team handball, volleyball, boxing, and basketball. TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen is one of the largest sports clubs in Germany.

His grandfather was a textile trader and owned a small textile store. His father transformed the store to Arun Emporium which is considered to be Nepal’s first department store.&lt;ref name=Chaudhary&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.chaudharygroup.com/index.php/about-us/history.html|work=Chaudhary Group|publisher=CG Touching Life Everyday|accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Republica&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharma|first=Rupak|title=Binod Chaudhary family is world's 1,342nd richest|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=50984|accessdate=16 April 2013|newspaper=MyRepublica|date=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chaudhary converted the store to a conglomerate which is one of the biggest corporate houses in Nepal.

==Business and Industry==
Inspired from his industrious father, Chaudhary always envisioned to become a very big industrialist of Nepal. With more than four decades of continuous hard work, he is living his dreams as he developed the Chaudhary Group to the biggest conglomerate of Nepal which is worth a billion dollars and more. Forbes magazine has listed him as a billionaire in 2014 and he is the 1,460th richest person in the world. Now(2018), he is the 1561st richest person in the world.&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;&lt;ref name=Republica /&gt;

Today CG stands as a transnational conglomerate which consists of nearly 80 companies spanning five continents. It has more than 60 brands in 30 countries with more than 6000 employees.&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;  Of its food brands, ‘Wai Wai’ noodles has been the most successful business. The brand produces more than a billion packets of noodles annually and is traded over 35 countries worldwide.  The Group’s other notable areas of interests are finance, banking, cement, real estate, hotels, electronics and home appliances, education, energy, biotech, power, retail.

Chaudhary has publicly stated that much of his success doing business in Nepal has come from his ability to make connections with the right people. He has had close connections with the Nepalese royalty, and credits his decision to give half ownership of a steelmaking company to the then-king's brother in 1982 as "the main reason for my success."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
[[File:Shaswat Dham , Nawalparasi nepal 3.jpg|thumb|Shashwat Dham in Nawalparasi Nepal built by Binod Chaudhary]]
Chaudhary has founded the Chaudhary Foundation which makes significant contributions on the fields of education, health, sports and youth empowerment.&lt;ref name=Binod /&gt;

Gyan Udaya Scholarship, which provides scholarships for needy students (more than 350 students have received this scholarship to date) and Samata Siksha Niketan, which provided a fund of Rs. 3.5 million for infrastructure are some of the major initiatives taken by CG foundation in education field.

'''CDT''' is an Australian digital television station broadcasting in remote central and eastern Australia. It is jointly owned by [[Southern Cross Austereo]] (owner of [[QQQ|Southern Cross Central]]) and [[Imparja Television|Imparja Television Pty Ltd]] (owner of [[Imparja Television]]) and operates under the company name ''Central Digital Television''.&lt;ref name="LicenceAlloc"&gt;{{cite web

The station is available via satellite and terrestrial platforms&lt;ref name="VAST-East"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.digitalready.gov.au/getattachment/81e1f2ff-ea8a-4571-a8d1-47e1e6033d37/Viewer-Access-Satellite-Television-service-for-cen

| publisher = digitalready.gov.au
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[free-to-air]] on a number of digital terrestrial transmitters, in remote areas of Australia.

The station is similar to other joint venture services already available in [[TDT (TV station)|Tasmania]], [[MDV (TV station)|Mildura]], [[DTD (TV station)|Darwin]] and [[West Digital Television|Western Australia]]. Officially, the service's call sign is CDT in the Remote Central and Eastern Australia TV2 licence areas, and '''IDQ''' in the [[Mount Isa]] TV1 licence area (reflecting the status of existing [[Southern Cross Television]] station [[QQQ|ITQ]]).

== History ==
Central Digital Television began broadcasting ''10 Central'', ''[[10 Boss]]'' and ''[[10 Peach|10 Peach]]'' as digital satellite channels on 30 June 2010, the same day as the Viewer Access Satellite Television service was partially launched. [[QQQ|Southern Cross Central]] and Imparja Television also commenced broadcasting digital satellite channels on the same day. The launch of the commercial digital channels coincided with the first analog television transmitter switch off in [[Mildura, Victoria]]. This was so viewers in the area who lost adequate television coverage were able to utilise VAST as an alternative source.&lt;ref name="DBCDEAnnualReport"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.archive.dbcde.gov.au/2012/october/annual_report_2010-11/section_2_-_performance_review/program_1.3_broadcasting_and_digital_television

| accessdate = 23 November 2013
| date = October 2012
| work = Department of Communications (previously DBCDE)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2010, VAST officially launched and began granting access to viewers in the Remote Central and Eastern Australia licence areas. This brought digital television to satellite viewers in the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia for the first time.&lt;ref name="DBCDEAnnualReport" /&gt; Digital terrestrial transmissions began in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory]] and Mount Isa, Queensland on 2 May 2011,&lt;ref name="TerrLaunch1"&gt;{{cite web

| title = Commercial digital television services switch on in Alice Springs and Mt Isa on 2 May

| date = 29 April 2011
| work = Australian Communications and Media Authority
}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other areas launching between 2012 and 2013.

== Programming ==
CDT is affiliated to Network Ten, but sources programming from two stations. ''Ten Central North'' is based on [[TVQ]] [[Brisbane]], and airs ''[[Ten News First]] Brisbane'' nightly at 5pm, as well as sports and events live in the Brisbane market. ''10 Central South'', 10 Peach and ''10 Boss'' are based on [[TEN (TV station)|TEN]] [[Sydney]], including news and sports such as ''[[Ten News First]] Sydney''. Both ''Ten Central'' channels also air programming produced by [[Southern Cross Austereo]]. ''10 Peach'' is the same as it is in every region.

The '''Confederation of Women Entrepreneurs''' (COWE)is a [[NGO]]/[[social organization]] engaged in the social and economic "upliftment of women through entrepreneurship". The slogan "Gearing women power" stands for the democratic structure of COWE and stands for "Of the women, for the women and by the women".

It was inaugurated on 22 December 2004 by Honourable [[Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh]], [[Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy|Shri Y.S.Rajasekhara Reddy]] at Jubilee Hall, [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], [[India]]. It has over four hundred and fifty [[entrepreneur]] members in the fields of [[food processing]], [[information technology]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[printing]], [[packaging]], [[manufacturing]], [[retailing]], [[industries]], [[textiles]] and the like.

COWE's vision is to build a group of women who are economically empowered, valued citizens of the nation by combining the dormant talent, skills, practical knowledge and resources of women with dedication and commitment.

COWE's mission is to enhance women's opportunities by creating a resource base of technical know-how, management, marketing skills, finance, infrastructure and equipment to promote [[entrepreneurship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co-we.com ]&lt;/ref&gt;

COWE partners with [[ZDH-SEQUA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zdh.de/english.html |title=&gt; english |publisher=www.zdh.de |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequa.de |title=sequa gGmbH |publisher=Sequa.de |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Study tours by delegates of COWE have been undertaken to Australia, Sri Lanka, Germany and Egypt with the support of the ZDH-SEQUA Partnership Programme.

To enable women entrepreneurs to showcase their products and to [[business networking|network]] with member organisations in India and abroad, COWE organised its first trade fair, COWE Trade Carnival, on 26–28 October 2007, at the [[Necklace Road]] in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. A sequel to it was organised in 2008.

An automotive park with 25 women entrepreneurs is being developed in the {{convert|30|acre|m2}} allotted to COWE by Government of Andhra Pradesh.

The Andhra Pradesh government allocated {{convert|90|acre|m2}} of land in three different areas in Medak district for COWE to set up exclusive industrial estates for women.

{{Business administration}}

'''Corporate governance''' is the mechanisms, processes and relations by which [[corporation]]s are controlled and directed.&lt;ref&gt;Shailer, Greg. ''An Introduction to Corporate Governance in Australia'', Pearson Education Australia, Sydney, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Governance structures and principles identify the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in the corporation (such as the board of directors, managers, shareholders, creditors, auditors, regulators, and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]) and includes the rules and procedures for making decisions in corporate affairs.&lt;ref&gt;The Corporate Governance of Iconic Executives, 87 Notre Dame Law Review 351 (2011), available at:http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040922&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate governance includes the processes through which corporations' objectives are set and pursued in the context of the social, regulatory and market environment. Governance mechanisms include monitoring the actions, policies, practices, and decisions of corporations, their agents, and affected stakeholders. Corporate governance practices are affected by attempts to align the interests of stakeholders.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/oecdprinciplesofcorporategovernance.htm|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tricker, Adrian, ''Essentials for Board Directors: An A–Z Guide'', Bloomberg Press, New York, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-57660-354-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the corporate governance practices of modern corporations, particularly in relation to accountability, increased following the high-profile collapses of a number of large corporations during 2001–2002, most of which involved accounting fraud; and then again after the recent [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis in 2008]].

[[Corporate scandals]] of various forms have maintained public and political interest in the [[regulation]] of corporate governance. In the U.S., these include [[Enron]] and [[MCI Inc.]] (formerly WorldCom). Their demise led to the enactment of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in 2002, a [[U.S. federal law]] intended to restore public confidence in corporate governance. Comparable failures in Australia ([[HIH Insurance|HIH]], [[One.Tel]]) are associated with the eventual passage of the [[CLERP 9]] reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Janet &amp; Shailer, Greg. The Effect of Board-Related Reforms on Investors Confidence. ''Australian Accounting Review'', 18(45) 2008: 123-134.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar corporate failures in other countries stimulated increased regulatory interest (e.g., [[Parmalat]] in Italy).

==Stakeholder interests==
In contemporary business corporations, the main external stakeholder groups are shareholders, debtholders, trade [[creditor]]s and suppliers, customers, and communities affected by the corporation's activities. Internal stakeholders are the [[board of directors]], [[Executive (management)|executives]], and other employees.

Much of the contemporary interest in corporate governance is concerned with mitigation of the [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interests]] between stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Goergen, Marc, International Corporate Governance, (Prentice Hall 2012) {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In large firms where there is a separation of ownership and management and no controlling shareholder, the [[principal–agent problem|principal–agent issue]] arises between upper-management (the "agent") which may have very different interests, and by definition considerably more information, than shareholders (the "principals"). The danger arises that, rather than overseeing management on behalf of shareholders, the board of directors may become insulated from shareholders and beholden to management.&lt;ref&gt;Pay Without Performance – the Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, Harvard University Press 2004, 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;  This aspect is particularly present in contemporary public debates and developments in regulatory [[policy]].&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt; More explicitly, the danger is that executives paid by stock option have incentive to divert the retained earnings of the firm into buying shares of own company stock, which will then cause the share price to rise.  However, retained earnings will then not be used to purchase the latest equipment or to hire quality people. Over the thirty or forty years that the model has been in place, the diversion of retained earnings to stock price manipulation has gradually eroded the competitiveness of the US industrial base.  While the public blames low wages in China for eliminating US jobs, the reality is that many US firms compete with high wage nations such as Canada, Germany, or Japan.  It is failure of large publicly-held corporations to invest in new equipment and people that holds the US back and erodes the middle class (fewer engineers, chemists, CNC machinists, accountants are needed as plants are left to age out).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/36211184/Deindustrialization_in_the_Granite_State_Part_2_Rising_Asset_Bubbles_Distort_the_Industrial_Base; see also https://www.npr.org/2017/02/06/513713606/glass-house-chronicles-the-sharp-decline-of-an-all-american-factory-town; see also https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ways of mitigating or preventing these conflicts of interests include the processes, customs, policies, laws, and institutions which affect the way a company is controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Financial Times Lexicon|url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=corporate-governance|work=[[The Financial Times]]|accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; An important theme of governance is the nature and extent of [[corporate accountability]]. A related discussion at the macro level focuses on the effect of a corporate governance system on [[economic efficiency]], with a strong emphasis on shareholders' welfare.&lt;ref name="DainesKlausner"&gt;Daines, Robert, and [[Michael Klausner]], 2008 "corporate law, economic analysis of," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.

==Other definitions==
Corporate governance has also been more narrowly defined as "a system of law and sound approaches by which corporations are directed and controlled focusing on the internal and external corporate structures with the intention of monitoring the actions of management and directors and thereby, mitigating agency risks which may stem from the misdeeds of corporate officers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sifuna|first=Anazett Pacy|title=Disclose or Abstain: The Prohibition of Insider Trading on Trial|journal=Journal of International Banking Law and Regulation|year=2012|volume=27|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate governance has also been defined as "Is the act of externally directing, controlling and evaluating a corporation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grcglossary.org/terms/corporate-governance |title=Corporate Governance via GRC Glossary |publisher=Open Compliance and Ethics Group |date=21 April 2010 |website=GRC Glossary |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related to the definition of Governance as "The act of externally directing, controlling and evaluating an entity, process or resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grcglossary.org/terms/governance |title=Governance via GRC Glossary |publisher=Open Compliance and Ethics Group |date=21 April 2010 |website=GRC Glossary |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, governance and corporate governance are different from management because governance must be EXTERNAL to the object being governed. Governing agents do not have personal control over, and are not part of the object that they govern. For example, it is not possible for a CIO to govern the IT function. They are personally accountable for the strategy and management of the function. As such, they “manage” the IT function; they do not “govern” it. At the same time, there may be a number of policies, authorized by the board, that the CIO follows. When the CIO is following these policies, they are performing “governance” activities because the primary intention of the policy is to serve a governance purpose. The board is ultimately “governing” the IT function because they stand outside of the function and are only able to externally direct, control and evaluate the IT function by virtue of established policies, procedures and indicators. Without these policies, procedures and indicators, the board has no way of governing, let alone affecting the IT function in any way.

One source defines corporate governance as "the set of conditions that shapes the [[ex post]] bargaining over the [[quasi-rent]]s generated by a firm."&lt;ref&gt;[[Luigi Zingales]], 2008.

[http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000370&amp;edition=current&amp;q= Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; The firm itself is modelled as a governance structure acting through the mechanisms of contract.&lt;ref&gt;• [[Oliver E.

==Principles==
Contemporary discussions of corporate governance tend to refer to principles raised in three documents released since 1990: The [[Cadbury Report]] (UK, 1992), the Principles of Corporate Governance (OECD, 1999, 2004 and 2015), and the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002 (US, 2002).  The Cadbury and [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) reports present general principles around which businesses are expected to operate to assure proper governance.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, informally referred to as Sarbox or Sox, is an attempt by the federal government in the United States to legislate several of the principles recommended in the Cadbury and OECD reports.
* '''Rights and equitable treatment of shareholders''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Articles II and III|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial service Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Sections 3.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002'', US Congress, Title VIII&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should respect the rights of shareholders and help shareholders to exercise those rights. They can help shareholders exercise their rights by openly and effectively communicating information and by encouraging shareholders to participate in general meetings.
* '''Interests of other stakeholders''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Preamble and Article IV|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should recognize that they have legal, contractual, social, and market driven obligations to non-shareholder stakeholders, including employees, investors, creditors, suppliers, local communities, customers, and policy makers.
* '''Role and responsibilities of the board''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, 2004, Article VI|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Section 3.4&lt;/ref&gt; The board needs sufficient relevant skills and understanding to review and challenge management performance. It also needs adequate size and appropriate levels of independence and commitment.
* '''Integrity and ethical behavior''':&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Sections 3.2, 3.3, 4.33, 4.51 and 7.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002'', US Congress, Title I, 101(c)(1), Title VIII, and Title IX, 406&lt;/ref&gt; Integrity should be a fundamental requirement in choosing corporate officers and board members.  Organizations should develop a code of conduct for their directors and executives that promotes ethical and responsible decision making.
* '''Disclosure and transparency''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OECD Principals of Corporate Governance, 2004, Articles I and V|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/18/31557724.pdf|work=[[OECD]]|accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992, Section 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations should clarify and make publicly known the roles and responsibilities of board and management to provide stakeholders with a level of accountability. They should also implement procedures to independently verify and safeguard the integrity of the company's financial reporting. Disclosure of material matters concerning the organization should be timely and balanced to ensure that all investors have access to clear, factual information.

==Models==
Different models of corporate governance differ according to the variety of capitalism in which they are embedded. The Anglo-American "model" tends to emphasize the interests of shareholders. The coordinated or [[multistakeholder model]] associated with Continental Europe and Japan also recognizes the interests of workers, managers, suppliers, customers, and the community. A related distinction is between market-oriented and network-oriented models of corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;[Sytse Douma] &amp; [Hein Schreuder] (2013) ''[http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page Economic Approaches to Organizations]'', 5th edition, chapter 15, London: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe (Two-tier board system) ===
{{main article|Aktiengesellschaft}}
Some continental European countries, including Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands, require a two-tiered board of directors as a means of improving corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;Tricker, Bob, ''Essentials for Board Directors: An A–Z Guide, Second Edition'', Bloomberg Press, New York, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-57660-354-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the two-tiered board, the executive board, made up of company executives, generally runs day-to-day operations while the supervisory board, made up entirely of non-executive directors who represent shareholders and employees, hires and fires the members of the executive board, determines their compensation, and reviews major business decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Hopt, Klaus J., "The German Two-Tier Board (Aufsichtsrat), A German View on Corporate Governance" in Hopt, Klaus J. and Wymeersch, Eddy (eds), ''Comparative Corporate Governance: Essays and Materials'', de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York, {{ISBN|3-11-015765-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] Committee on Corporate Governance defines corporate governance as the "acceptance by management of the inalienable rights of shareholders as the true owners of the corporation and of their own role as trustees on behalf of the shareholders.

===United States, United Kingdom===
The so-called "Anglo-American model" of corporate governance emphasizes the interests of shareholders. It relies on a single-tiered board of directors that is normally dominated by non-executive directors elected by shareholders. Because of this, it is also known as "the unitary system".&lt;ref&gt;Cadbury, Adrian, ''Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance'', Gee, London, December, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallin, Christine A., "Corporate Governance Developments in the UK" in Mallin, Christine A (ed), ''Handbook on International Corporate Governance: Country Analyses, Second Edition'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84980-123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this system, many boards include some executives from the company (who are [[ex officio]] members of the board). Non-executive directors are expected to outnumber executive directors and hold key posts, including audit and compensation committees. In the United Kingdom, the [[CEO]] generally does not also serve as Chairman of the Board, whereas in the US having the dual role has been the norm, despite major misgivings regarding the effect on corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, William G, ''The Board Book: An Insider's Guide for Directors and Trustees'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York &amp; London, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-393-06645-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of US firms combining both roles is declining, however.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russellreynolds.com/newsroom/splitting-the-ceo-and-chairman-roles-yes-or-no&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, corporations are directly governed by state laws, while the exchange (offering and trading) of securities in corporations (including shares) is governed by federal legislation. Many US states have adopted the [[Model Business Corporation Act]], but the dominant state law for publicly traded corporations is [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which continues to be the place of incorporation for the majority of publicly traded corporations.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004&gt;Bebchuck LA. (2004).[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=387940 The Case for Increasing Shareholder Power].''Harvard Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual rules for corporations are based upon the [[corporate charter]] and, less authoritatively, the corporate [[bylaw]]s.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004/&gt;
Shareholders cannot initiate changes in the corporate charter although they can initiate changes to the corporate bylaws.&lt;ref name=Bebchuck2004/&gt;

It is sometimes colloquially stated that in the USA and the UK 'the shareholders own the company'. This is, however, a misconception as argued by Eccles &amp; Youmans (2015) and Kay (2015).&lt;ref&gt;http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/materiality-in-corporate-governance-the-statement-of-significant-audiences-and-materiality; https://next.ft.com/content/7bd1b20a-879b-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founder centrism===
Recent scholarship from the [[University of Oxford]] outlines a new theory of corporate governance, founder centrism, which is premised upon a narrowing in the separation between ownership and control. Through the lens of concentrated equity ownership theory, a new theory of the firm, the traditional checklist of best practices are inapplicable, as evidenced by the significant outperformance of technology companies with dual-class share structures and integrated CEO/Chairman positions:

{{Cquote|
"Founder-run companies, such as Facebook, Netflix and Google are at the forefront of a new wave of organizational structure better suited to long-term value creation. Founder centrism, an inclusive concept within CEO theory, integrates the capacity of founder and non-founder senior leadership to adopt an owner’s mindset in traditionally structured corporations, such as Thomas J. Watson Sr. and Thomas Watson Jr. with IBM, Steve Jobs and Tim Cook with Apple, Jamie Dimon with JPMorgan Chase, Lloyd Blankfein with Goldman Sachs, Rick George with Suncor Energy, and many others. In substance, all fall within the ambit of founder centrism – leaders with a founder’s mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective, and an intense focus on exponential value creation without enslavement to a quarter-by-quarter upward growth trajectory. In traditionally structured firms, high performing executives gain deference, become highly influential, and take on the qualities of concentrated equity owners. To the extent these leaders embrace founder centrism, their companies will experience efficiency advantages relative to competitors operating within traditional parameters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rojas|first1=Claudio|title=Eclipse of the Public Corporation Revisited: Concentrated Equity Ownership Theory|url=https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2017/06/eclipse-public-corporation-revisited-concentrated-equity-ownership|publisher=The University of Oxford|accessdate=June 27, 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;|100%|cquote}}

An article published by the Australian Institute of Company Directors called 'Do Boards Need to become more Entrepreneurial?' written by Nigel Hennessy FAICD also considered the need for Founder Centrism behaviour at board level to appropriately manage disruption. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hennessy|first1=Nigel|title=Do boards need to become more Entrepreneurial|url=http://www.aicd.companydirectors.com.au/-/media/cd2/resources/advocacy/governance-leadership-centre/pdf/the-entrepreneurial-board.ashx|publisher=AICD|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
{{Corporate law|doctrines}}

Corporations are created as [[legal person]]s by the laws and regulations of a particular jurisdiction. These may vary in many respects between countries, but a corporation's legal person status is fundamental to all jurisdictions and is conferred by statute. This allows the entity to hold property in its own right without reference to any particular real person. It also results in the perpetual existence that characterizes the modern corporation. The statutory granting of corporate existence may arise from general purpose legislation (which is the general case) or from a statute to create a specific corporation, which was the only method prior to the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In addition to the statutory laws of the relevant jurisdiction, corporations are subject to [[common law]] in some countries, and various laws and regulations affecting business practices. In most jurisdictions, corporations also have a constitution that provides individual rules that govern the corporation and authorize or constrain its decision-makers. This constitution is identified by a variety of terms; in English-speaking jurisdictions, it is usually known as the Corporate Charter or the [[memorandum of association|Memorandum]] and Articles of Association. The capacity of shareholders to modify the constitution of their corporation can vary substantially.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The U.S. passed the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) in 1977, with subsequent modifications. This law made it illegal to bribe government officials and required corporations to maintain adequate accounting controls. It is enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Substantial civil and criminal penalties have been levied on corporations and executives convicted of bribery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/guidance/ DOJ Website – Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Guidance – May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK passed the [[Bribery Act 2010|Bribery Act]] in 2010. This law made it illegal to bribe either government or private citizens or make facilitating payments (i.e., payment to a government official to perform their routine duties more quickly). It also required corporations to establish controls to prevent bribery.

===Sarbanes-Oxley Act===
The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002 was enacted in the wake of a series of high-profile corporate scandals. It established a series of requirements that affect corporate governance in the U.S. and influenced similar laws in many other countries.  The law required, along with many other elements, that:
* The [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB) be established to regulate the auditing profession, which had been self-regulated prior to the law. Auditors are responsible for reviewing the financial statements of corporations and issuing an opinion as to their reliability.
* The [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) and [[Chief Financial Officer]] (CFO) attest to the financial statements. Prior to the law, CEOs had claimed in court they hadn't reviewed the information as part of their defense.
* Board audit committees have members that are independent and disclose whether or not at least one is a financial expert, or reasons why no such expert is on the audit committee.
* External audit firms cannot provide certain types of consulting services and must rotate their lead partner every 5 years. Further, an audit firm cannot audit a company if those in specified senior management roles worked for the auditor in the past year. Prior to the law, there was the real or perceived conflict of interest between providing an independent opinion on the accuracy and reliability of financial statements when the same firm was also providing lucrative consulting services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ204/pdf/PLAW-107publ204.pdf Text of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Codes and guidelines==
Corporate governance principles and codes have been developed in different countries and issued from stock exchanges, corporations, institutional investors, or associations (institutes) of directors and managers with the support of governments and international organizations. As a rule, compliance with these governance recommendations is not mandated by law, although the codes linked to stock exchange [[Stock exchange#Listing requirements|listing requirements]] may have a coercive effect.

===Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development principles===
One of the most influential guidelines on corporate governance are the [[G20]]/[[OECD]] Principles of Corporate Governance, first published as the OECD Principles in 1999, revised in 2004 and revised again and endorsed by the G20 in 2015.&lt;ref name="oecd.org" /&gt; The Principles are often referenced by countries developing local codes or guidelines. Building on the work of the OECD, other international organizations, private sector associations and more than 20 national corporate governance codes formed  the [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting]] (ISAR) to produce their Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/iteteb20063_en.pdf Guidance on Good Practices in Corporate Governance Disclosure.]&lt;/ref&gt; This internationally agreed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/c2isard31_en.pdf TD/B/COM.2/ISAR/31&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; benchmark consists of more than fifty distinct disclosure items across five broad categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Standards of Accounting and Reporting, Corporate Governance Disclosure |url=http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=2920&amp;lang=1 |work=[[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123092039/http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=2920&amp;lang=1 |archivedate=2008-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Auditing
* Board and management structure and process
* Corporate responsibility and compliance in organization
* Financial transparency and information disclosure
* Ownership structure and exercise of control rights

The [http://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/guidelines-corporate-governance-soes.htm OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises] are complementary to the [http://www.oecd.org/corporate/principles-corporate-governance.htm G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance], providing guidance tailored to the corporate governance challenges unique to [[state-owned enterprise]]s.

===Stock exchange listing standards===
Companies listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) and other stock exchanges are required to meet certain governance standards. For example, the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires, among many other elements:
* Independent directors: "Listed companies must have a majority of independent directors...Effective boards of directors exercise independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities. Requiring a majority of independent directors will increase the quality of board oversight and lessen the possibility of damaging conflicts of interest." (Section 303A.01) An independent director is not part of management and has no "material financial relationship" with the company.
* Board meetings that exclude management: "To empower non-management directors to serve as a more effective check on management, the non-management directors of each listed company must meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management." (Section 303A.03)
* Boards organize their members into committees with specific responsibilities per defined charters. "Listed companies must have a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors." This committee is responsible for nominating new members for the board of directors. Compensation and Audit Committees are also specified, with the latter subject to a variety of listing standards as well as outside regulations.

===Other guidelines===
The investor-led organisation International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) was set up by individuals centered around the ten largest pension funds in the world 1995. The aim is to promote global corporate governance standards. The network is led by investors that manage 18 trillion dollars, and members are located in fifty different countries. ICGN has developed a suite of global guidelines ranging from shareholder rights to business ethics.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]] (WBCSD) has done work on corporate governance, particularly on [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515141435/http%3A//www.wbcsd.org/Pages/EDocument/EDocumentDetails.aspx?ID%3D80%26NoSearchContextKey%3Dtrue Accounting and Reporting], and in 2004 released [https://archive.is/20140625080626/http://www.wbcsd.org/Pages/EDocument/EDocumentDetails.aspx?ID=15610&amp;NoSearchContextKey=true Issue Management Tool: Strategic challenges for business in the use of corporate responsibility codes, standards, and frameworks]. This document offers general information and a perspective from a business association/think-tank on a few key codes, standards and frameworks relevant to the sustainability agenda.

In 2009, the International Finance Corporation and the UN Global Compact released a report, [http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/Corporate_Governance/Corporate_Governance_IFC_UNGC.pdf Corporate Governance - the Foundation for Corporate Citizenship and Sustainable Business], linking the environmental, social and governance responsibilities of a company to its financial performance and long-term sustainability.

Most codes are largely voluntary. An issue raised in the U.S. since the 2005 Disney decision&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akingump.com/docs/publication/795.pdf The Disney Decision of 2005 and the precedent it sets for corporate governance and fiduciary responsibility, Kuckreja, Akin Gump, Aug 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615105810/http://www.akingump.com/docs/publication/795.pdf |date=2007-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the degree to which companies manage their governance responsibilities; in other words, do they merely try to supersede the legal threshold, or should they create governance guidelines that ascend to the level of best practice.  For example, the guidelines issued by associations of directors, corporate managers and individual companies tend to be wholly voluntary, but such documents may have a wider effect by prompting other companies to adopt similar practices.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== United States of America ===
[[Robert E. Wright]] argues in ''Corporation Nation'' (2014) that the governance of early U.S. corporations, of which over 20,000 existed by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] of 1861-1865, was superior to that of corporations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries because early corporations governed themselves like "republics", replete with numerous "checks and balances" against fraud and against usurpation of power by managers or by large shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Wright, Corporation Nation (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; (The term [[Robber baron (industrialist)|"robber baron"]] became particularly associated with US corporate figures in the [[Gilded Age]] - the late 19th century.)

In the immediate aftermath of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] legal scholars such as [[Adolf Augustus Berle]], Edwin Dodd, and [[Gardiner C. Means]] pondered on the changing role of the modern corporation in society.&lt;ref&gt;Berle and Means' ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'', (1932, Macmillan)&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Chicago school of economics]], [[Ronald Coase]]&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Coase, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the notion of transaction costs into the understanding of why firms are founded and how they continue to behave.&lt;ref name="catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk"&gt;[[Sytse Douma]] &amp; [[Hein Schreuder]] (2013) "Economic Approaches to Organizations", 5th edition, London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page]&lt;/ref&gt;

US economic expansion through the emergence of multinational corporations after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] (1939-1945) saw the establishment of the [[managerial class]]. Several [[Harvard Business School]] management professors studied and wrote about the new class: [[Myles Mace]] (entrepreneurship), [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] (business history), [[Jay Lorsch]] (organizational behavior) and Elizabeth MacIver (organizational behavior). According to Lorsch and MacIver "many large corporations have dominant control over business affairs without sufficient accountability or monitoring by their board of directors".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In the 1980s, [[Eugene Fama]] and [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Fama]] and [[Michael C. Jensen|Michael Jensen]] ''The Separation of Ownership and Control'', (1983, Journal of Law and Economics)&lt;/ref&gt; established the [[principal–agent problem]] as a way of understanding corporate governance: the firm is seen as a series of contracts.&lt;ref&gt;See also the 1989 article by [[Kathleen Eisenhardt]]: "Agency theory: an assessment and review", ''Academy of Management Review'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 1977 to 1997, corporate directors' duties in the U.S. expanded beyond their traditional legal responsibility of duty of loyalty to the corporation and to its shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Curtis J.

In the first half of the 1990s, the issue of corporate governance in the U.S. received considerable press attention due to a spate of CEO dismissals (for example, at [[IBM]], [[Kodak]], and [[Honeywell]]) by their boards. The [[CalPERS|California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS)]] led a wave of ''institutional'' shareholder activism (something only very rarely seen before), as a way of ensuring that corporate value would not be destroyed by the now traditionally cozy relationships between the CEO and the board of directors (for example, by the unrestrained issuance of stock options, not infrequently [[Options backdating|back-dated]]).

In the early 2000s, the massive bankruptcies (and criminal malfeasance) of [[Enron]] and [[Worldcom]], as well as lesser [[corporate scandals]] (such as those involving [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia Communications]], [[AOL]], [[Arthur Andersen]], [[Global Crossing]], and [[Tyco International|Tyco]]) led to increased political interest in corporate governance. This was reflected in the passage of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] of 2002. Other triggers for continued interest in the corporate governance of organizations included the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|financial crisis of 2008/9]] and the level of CEO pay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Steven N.

In 1997 the [[East Asian Financial Crisis]] severely affected the economies of [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[South Korea]], [[Malaysia]], and the [[Philippines]] through the exit of foreign capital after property assets collapsed.

==Stakeholders==
Key parties involved in corporate governance include stakeholders such as the board of directors, management and shareholders. External stakeholders such as creditors, auditors, customers, suppliers, government agencies, and the community at large also exert influence. The agency view of the corporation posits that the shareholder forgoes decision rights (control) and entrusts the manager to act in the shareholders' best (joint) interests. Partly as a result of this separation between the two investors and managers, corporate governance mechanisms include a system of controls intended to help align managers' incentives with those of shareholders. Agency concerns (risk) are necessarily lower for a [[controlling interest|controlling shareholder]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In private for-profit corporations, shareholders elect the board of directors to represent their interests. In the case of nonprofits, stakeholders may have some role in recommending or selecting board members, but typically the board itself decides who will serve on the board as a 'self-perpetuating' board.&lt;ref&gt;Dent, George W., Corporate Governance Without Shareholders: A Cautionary Lesson from Non-Profit Organizations (2014). Delaware Journal of Corporate Law (DJCL), Vol. 39, No. 1, 2014; Case Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2014-34. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2481646 Available at SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of leadership that the board has over the organization varies; in practice at large organizations, the executive management, principally the CEO, drives major initiatives with the oversight and approval of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://perma.cc/2YHV-KXNR|title=Why Nonprofits Have a Board Problem - HBS Working Knowledge - Harvard Business School|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Harvard Business School|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsibilities of the board of directors===
Former Chairman of the Board of [[General Motors]] John G. Smale wrote in 1995: "The board is responsible for the successful perpetuation of the corporation.  That responsibility cannot be relegated to management."&lt;ref name="HBRGov1"&gt;{{cite book
| last = Harvard Business Review
| first = HBR
| year = 2000
| title = HBR on Corporate Governance | publisher = Harvard Business School Press
| isbn = 1-57851-237-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[board of directors]] is expected to play a key role in corporate governance. The board has responsibility for: CEO selection and succession; providing feedback to management on the organization's strategy; compensating senior executives; monitoring financial health, performance and risk; and ensuring accountability of the organization to its investors and authorities. Boards typically have several committees (e.g., Compensation, Nominating and Audit) to perform their work.&lt;ref name="Charan 2005"&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 0-7879-7139-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OECD Principles of Corporate Governance (2004) describe the responsibilities of the board; some of these are summarized below:&lt;ref name="oecd.org" /&gt;
* Board members should be informed and act ethically and in good faith, with due diligence and care, in the best interest of the company and the shareholders.
* Review and guide corporate strategy, objective setting, major plans of action, risk policy, capital plans, and annual budgets.
* Oversee major acquisitions and divestitures.
* Select, compensate, monitor and replace key executives and oversee succession planning.
* Align key executive and board remuneration (pay) with the longer-term interests of the company and its shareholders.
* Ensure a formal and transparent board member nomination and election process.
* Ensure the integrity of the corporation's accounting and financial reporting systems, including their independent audit.
* Ensure appropriate systems of internal control are established.
* Oversee the process of disclosure and communications.
* Where committees of the board are established, their mandate, composition and working procedures should be well-defined and disclosed.

===Stakeholder interests===
All parties to corporate governance have an interest, whether direct or indirect, in the [[financial performance]] of the corporation. Directors, workers and management receive salaries, benefits and reputation, while investors expect to receive financial returns. For lenders, it is specified interest payments, while returns to equity investors arise from dividend distributions or capital gains on their stock. Customers are concerned with the certainty of the provision of goods and services of an appropriate quality; suppliers are concerned with compensation for their goods or services, and possible continued trading relationships. These parties provide value to the corporation in the form of financial, physical, human and other forms of capital. Many parties may also be concerned with [[corporate social responsibility|corporate social performance]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A key factor in a party's decision to participate in or engage with a corporation is their confidence that the corporation will deliver the party's expected outcomes. When categories of parties (stakeholders) do not have sufficient confidence that a corporation is being controlled and directed in a manner consistent with their desired outcomes, they are less likely to engage with the corporation. When this becomes an endemic system feature, the loss of confidence and participation in markets may affect many other stakeholders, and increases the likelihood of political action. There is substantial interest in how external systems and institutions, including markets, influence corporate governance.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

===’Absentee landlords’ vs. capital stewards===
[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]]  experts insist that “institutional asset owners now seem more eager to take to task [the] negligent CEOs” of the companies whose shares they own.&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. Nicolas J. |last1=Firzli |title= Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth? |url= https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth |accessdate=1 November 2016 |work=Analyse Financière| date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This development is part of a broader trend towards more fully exercised asset ownership – notably from the part of the [[board of directors|boards of directors]] (‘trustees’) of large UK, Dutch, Scandinavian and Canadian pension investors:

: “No longer ‘[[absentee landlords]]’, {{bracket|[[pension fund]]}} trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their [[governance]] prerogatives across the boardrooms of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Benelux]] and [[America]]: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups […] to ‘shift the [whole economic] system towards sustainable investment’.”&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M. Nicolas J. |last1=Firzli |title= Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth? |url= https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth |accessdate=1 November 2016 |work=Analyse Financière| date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could eventually put more pressure on the [[CEO]]s of [[public company|publicly listed companies]], as “more than ever before, many [North American,] UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]]”, and other [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-centric]] investment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In Britain, “The widespread social disenchantment that followed the [2008-2012] [[great recession]] had an impact” on all stakeholders, including [[pension fund]] board members and investment managers.&lt;ref name="Pensions Age"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Louise |last1=Farrand |title= Investing in Change |url= http://www.pensionsage.com/pa/images/activism_Nov2016.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2017 |work=Pensions Age| date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the UK’s largest pension funds are thus already active stewards of their assets, engaging with [[corporate board]]s and speaking up when they think it is necessary.&lt;ref name="Pensions Age"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Louise |last1=Farrand |title= Investing in Change |url= http://www.pensionsage.com/pa/images/activism_Nov2016.pdf|accessdate=2 April 2017 |work=Pensions Age| date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control and ownership structures===
Control and ownership structure refers to the types and composition of shareholders in a corporation. In some countries such as most of Continental Europe, ownership is not necessarily equivalent to control due to the existence of e.g. '''dual-class shares''', '''ownership pyramids''', '''voting coalitions''', '''proxy votes''' and '''clauses in the articles of association that confer additional voting rights to long-term shareholders'''.&lt;ref name="Goergen, Marc 2012"&gt;Goergen, Marc, ''International Corporate Governance'', Prentice Hall, Harlow, January, 2012, Chapter 3, {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership is typically defined as the ownership of cash flow rights whereas control refers to ownership of control or voting rights.&lt;ref name="Goergen, Marc 2012"/&gt; Researchers often "measure" control and ownership structures by using some observable measures of control and ownership concentration or the extent of inside control and ownership. Some features or types of control and ownership structure involving [[corporate group]]s include pyramids, [[cross ownership|cross-shareholdings]], rings, and webs. German "concerns" (Konzern) are legally recognized corporate groups with complex structures. Japanese [[keiretsu]] (系列) and South Korean [[chaebol]] (which tend to be family-controlled) are corporate groups which consist of complex interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. Cross-shareholding is an essential feature of keiretsu and chaebol groups[http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/1397.html]. Corporate engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders can differ substantially across different control and ownership structures.

====Family control====
Family interests dominate ownership and control structures of some corporations, and it has been suggested that the oversight of family-controlled corporations are superior to corporations "controlled" by institutional investors (or with such diverse share ownership that they are controlled by management). A recent study by Credit Suisse found that companies in which "founding families retain a stake of more than 10% of the company's capital enjoyed a superior performance over their respective sectorial peers." Since 1996, this superior performance amounts to 8% per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.credit-suisse.com/research/en/ Error 404&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081111151350/http://www.credit-suisse.com/research/en/ |date=2008-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forget the celebrity CEO. "Look beyond Six Sigma and the latest technology fad.

====Diffuse shareholders====
The significance of institutional investors varies substantially across countries. In developed Anglo-American countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, U.K., U.S.), institutional investors dominate the market for stocks in larger corporations. While the majority of the shares in the Japanese market are held by financial companies and industrial corporations, these are not institutional investors if their holdings are largely with-on group.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The largest pools of invested money (such as the mutual fund '[[Vanguard 500]]', or the largest investment management firm for corporations, [[State Street Corp.]]) are designed to maximize the benefits of diversified investment by investing in a very large number of different corporations with sufficient [[liquidity]]. The idea is this strategy will largely eliminate individual firm [[financial risk|financial]] or other risk. A consequence of this approach is that these investors have relatively little interest in the governance of a  particular corporation. It is often assumed that, if institutional investors pressing for changes decide they will likely be costly because of "[[golden handshake]]s" or the effort required, they will simply sell out their investment.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Mechanisms and controls==
Corporate governance mechanisms and controls are designed to reduce the inefficiencies that arise from [[moral hazard]] and [[adverse selection]]. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sytse Douma]] &amp; [[Hein Schreuder]] (2013) "Economic Approaches to Organizations", 5th edition, chapter 15, London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page]&lt;/ref&gt; Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) in the case of privately held companies or a firm belonging to a [[business group]]. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers' behavior occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the [[external auditor]]) attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal monitoring and control system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing [[incentive alignment]] toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals are tempted to cross lines of ethical behavior, for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.&lt;ref name="catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk"/&gt;

===Internal corporate governance controls===
Internal corporate governance controls monitor activities and then take corrective actions to accomplish organisational goals. Examples include:
* '''Monitoring by the board of directors''': The board of directors, with its legal authority to hire, fire and compensate top management, safeguards invested capital. Regular board meetings allow potential problems to be identified, discussed and avoided. Whilst non-executive directors are thought to be more independent, they may not always result in more effective corporate governance and may not increase performance.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagat &amp; Black, "The Uncertain Relationship Between Board Composition and Firm Performance", 54 Business Lawyer&lt;/ref&gt; Different board structures are optimal for different firms. Moreover, the ability of the board to monitor the firm's executives is a function of its access to information. Executive directors possess superior knowledge of the decision-making process and therefore evaluate top management on the basis of the quality of its decisions that lead to financial performance outcomes, ''ex ante''. It could be argued, therefore, that executive directors look beyond the financial criteria.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Internal control procedures and internal auditors''': Internal control procedures are policies implemented by an entity's board of directors, audit committee, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance of the entity achieving its objectives related to reliable financial reporting, operating efficiency, and compliance with laws and regulations. Internal auditors are personnel within an organization who test the design and implementation of the entity's internal control procedures and the reliability of its financial reporting.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Balance of power''': The simplest balance of power is very common; require that the President be a different person from the Treasurer.  This application of separation of power is further developed in companies where separate divisions check and balance each other's actions.  One group may propose company-wide administrative changes, another group review and can veto the changes, and a third group check that the interests of people (customers, shareholders, employees) outside the three groups are being met.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Remuneration''': Performance-based remuneration is designed to relate some proportion of salary to individual performance. It may be in the form of cash or non-cash payments such as [[share (finance)|shares]] and [[share option]]s, [[superannuation]] or other benefits. Such incentive schemes, however, are reactive in the sense that they provide no mechanism for preventing mistakes or opportunistic behavior, and can elicit myopic behavior.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* '''Monitoring by large shareholders''' and/or '''monitoring by banks and other large creditors''': Given their large investment in the firm, these stakeholders have the incentives, combined with the right degree of control and power, to monitor the management.&lt;ref&gt;Goergen, Marc, ''International Corporate Governance'', Prentice Hall, Harlow, January, 2012, pp. 104–105, {{ISBN|978-0-273-75125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In publicly traded U.S. corporations, boards of directors are largely ''chosen'' by the President/CEO and the President/CEO often takes the Chair of the Board position for him/herself (which makes it much more difficult for the institutional owners to "fire" him/her). The practice of the CEO also being the Chair of the Board is fairly common in large American corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Tom C. W., The Corporate Governance of Iconic Executives (2011). 87 Notre Dame Law Review 351 (2011). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2040922&lt;/ref&gt;

While this practice is common in the U.S., it is relatively rare elsewhere. In the U.K., successive codes of best practice have recommended against duality.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===External corporate governance controls===
External corporate governance controls the external stakeholders' exercise over the organization. Examples include:
* competition
* debt covenants
* demand for and assessment of performance information (especially [[financial statements]])
* government regulations
* managerial labour market
* media pressure
* takeovers
* [[proxy firm]]s

===Financial reporting and the independent auditor===
The board of directors has primary responsibility for the corporation's internal and external [[financial report]]ing functions. The [[chief executive officer]] and [[chief financial officer]] are crucial participants, and boards usually have a high degree of reliance on them for the integrity and supply of accounting information. They oversee the internal accounting systems, and are dependent on the corporation's [[accountant]]s and [[internal auditor]]s.

Current accounting rules under [[International Accounting Standards]] and U.S. [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] allow managers some choice in determining the methods of measurement and criteria for recognition of various financial reporting elements.  The potential exercise of this choice to improve apparent performance increases the [[information risk]] for users. Financial reporting fraud, including non-disclosure and deliberate falsification of values also contributes to users' information risk. To reduce this risk and to enhance the perceived integrity of financial reports, corporation financial reports must be audited by an independent [[external auditor]] who issues a report that accompanies the financial statements.

One area of concern is whether the auditing firm acts as both the independent auditor and management consultant to the firm they are auditing. This may result in a conflict of interest which places the integrity of financial reports in doubt due to client pressure to appease management. The power of the corporate client to initiate and terminate management consulting services and, more fundamentally, to select and dismiss accounting firms contradicts the concept of an independent auditor.  Changes enacted in the United States in the form of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] (following numerous corporate scandals, culminating with the [[Enron scandal]]) prohibit accounting firms from providing both auditing and management consulting services. Similar provisions are in place under clause 49 of Standard Listing Agreement in India.

==Systemic problems==
* Demand for information: In order to influence the directors, the shareholders must combine with others to form a voting group which can pose a real threat of carrying resolutions or appointing directors at a general meeting.&lt;ref name=6.9&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K8zJw-CshBYC&amp;pg=SA6-PA9&amp;dq=%22A+barrier+to+shareholders+using+good+information+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E_vkT8HeH66I2gW44dTZCQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20barrier%20to%20shareholders%20using%20good%20information%20%22&amp;f=false Current Trends in Management] 6.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monitoring costs: A barrier to shareholders using good information is the cost of processing it, especially to a small shareholder. The traditional answer to this problem is the [[efficient-market hypothesis]] (in finance, the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) asserts that financial markets are efficient), which suggests that the small shareholder will free ride on the judgments of larger professional investors.&lt;ref name=6.9/&gt;
* Supply of accounting information: Financial accounts form a crucial link in enabling providers of finance to monitor directors. Imperfections in the financial reporting process will cause imperfections in the effectiveness of corporate governance. This should, ideally, be corrected by the working of the external auditing process.&lt;ref name=6.9/&gt;

==Issues==

===Executive pay===
{{main article|Say on pay}}
Increasing attention and regulation (as under the [[Swiss referendum "against corporate rip-offs" of 2013]]) has been brought to executive pay levels since the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. Research on the relationship between firm performance and [[executive compensation]] does not identify consistent and significant relationships between executives' remuneration and firm performance. Not all firms experience the same levels of agency conflict, and external and internal monitoring devices may be more effective for some than for others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=current/&gt; Some researchers have found that the largest CEO performance incentives came from ownership of the firm's shares, while other researchers found that the relationship between share ownership and firm performance was dependent on the level of ownership. The results suggest that increases in ownership above 20% cause management to become more entrenched, and less interested in the welfare of their shareholders.&lt;ref name=current/&gt;

Some argue that firm performance is positively associated with share [[Option (finance)|option]] plans and that these plans direct managers' energies and extend their decision horizons toward the long-term, rather than the short-term, performance of the company.  However, that point of view came under substantial criticism circa in the wake of various security scandals including mutual fund timing episodes and, in particular, the backdating of option grants as documented by University of Iowa academic Erik Lie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X06001644 | doi=10.1016/j.jfineco.2005.12.003 | volume=83 | issue=2 | title=Does backdating explain the stock price pattern around executive stock option grants? | year=2007 | journal=Journal of Financial Economics | pages=271–295 | last1 = Heron | first1 = Randall A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported by James Blander and Charles Forelle of the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref name=current&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K8zJw-CshBYC&amp;pg=SA6-PA14&amp;lpg=SA6-PA14&amp;dq=Some+researchers+have+found+that+the+largest+CEO+performance+incentives+came+from+ownership+of+the+firm%27s+shares&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ihr3qx-hpF&amp;sig=P9L9MBVyoD8BsKIvr6nxOn8NPj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xuDkT4fuHeW42wXIn5XaCQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Some%20researchers%20have%20found%20that%20the%20largest%20CEO%20performance%20incentives%20came%20from%20ownership%20of%20the%20firm%27s%20shares&amp;f=false Current Trends in Management]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/7193 As Companies Probe Backdating, More Top Officials Take a Fall] |Charles Forelle and James Bandler| October 12, 2006| wsj.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the negative influence on public opinion caused by the 2006 backdating scandal, use of options faced various criticisms.  A particularly forceful and long running argument concerned the interaction of executive options with corporate stock repurchase programs.  Numerous authorities (including U.S. Federal Reserve Board economist Weisbenner) determined options may be employed in concert with stock buybacks in a manner contrary to shareholder interests.  These authors argued that, in part, corporate stock buybacks for U.S. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 companies surged to a $500 billion annual rate in late 2006 because of the effect of options.  A compendium of academic works on the option/buyback issue is included in the study [http://ssrn.com/abstract=927111 ''Scandal''] by author [http://ssrn.com/author=665434 M. Gumport] issued in 2006.

A combination of accounting changes and governance issues led options to become a less popular means of remuneration as 2006 progressed, and various alternative implementations of buybacks surfaced to challenge the dominance of "open market" cash buybacks as the preferred means of implementing a [[share repurchase]] plan.

===Separation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board roles===
Shareholders elect a board of directors, who in turn hire a [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) to lead management. The primary responsibility of the board relates to the selection and retention of the CEO.  However, in many U.S. corporations the CEO and Chairman of the Board roles are held by the same person. This creates an inherent conflict of interest between management and the board.

Critics of combined roles argue the two roles should be separated to avoid the conflict of interest and more easily enable a poorly performing CEO to be replaced. [[Warren Buffett]] wrote in 2014: "In my service on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I’ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocre CEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letters-Warren Buffett-2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates argue that empirical studies do not indicate that separation of the roles improves stock market performance and that it should be up to shareholders to determine what corporate governance model is appropriate for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/opinion/the-jamie-dimon-witch-hunt.html?_r=0 NYT – Jeffrey Sonnenfeld – The Jamie Dimon Witch Hunt – May 8, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, 73.4% of U.S. companies had combined roles; this fell to 57.2% by May 2012. Many U.S. companies with combined roles have appointed a "Lead Director" to improve independence of the board from management. German and UK companies have generally split the roles in nearly 100% of listed companies. Empirical evidence does not indicate one model is superior to the other in terms of performance. However, one study indicated that poorly performing firms tend to remove separate CEOs more frequently than when the CEO/Chair roles are combined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3290632/SHOULD_THE_USA_FOLLOW_THE_UKS_LEAD_AND_SPLIT_THE_DUAL_CEO_CHAIRPERSONs_ROLE University of Cambridge-Magdalena Smith – Should the USA follow the UK's lead and split the dual CEO/Chairperson role?]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3819">'''David Ford''' (born 1944) is a British organizational theorist, Professor Emeritus at the [[University of Bath School of Management]], and co-founder of the [[International Marketing and Purchasing Group]] (IMP Group) in the mid 1970s. He is known for his work with [[Håkan Håkansson]] on [[business network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, Cyril. "Interdependencies, trust and information in relationships, alliances and networks." ''Accounting, Organizations and Society'' 26.2 (2001): 161-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gummesson, Evert. "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.199.5179&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=41 Relationship marketing in the new economy]." ''Journal of Relationship Marketing'' 1.1 (2002): 37-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Ford obtained his BSc in Mechanical Engineering at the [[University of Salford]], his MSc at the [[University of Bradford]], and his PhD at the [[Manchester Business School]]. In 2007 he was awarded an Honorary Degree from the [[Uppsala Universitet]], Sweden for developing "a worldwide system for improving the way companies interact with customers and suppliers."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/2007/10/25/sweden-degree.html Honorary degree for researcher who improved customer-supplier relations]," ''Internal News,'' University of Bath, 25 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford started his academic career at the University of Bath as lecturer, and promoted to senior lecturer, reader and in 1989 Professor of Marketing. In 2008 he retired as Emeritus Professor, and became Affiliate Professor at [[KEDGE Business School]] in Marseille, France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kedgebs.com/sites/default/files/cv/cvsep12.pdf DAVID FORD, Curriculum Vitae] at kedgebs.com. Accessed 28.01.2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 he was co-founder of the [[Industrial Marketing and Purchasing Group]] (IMP group).&lt;ref&gt;''International Journal of Technology Management.'' Vol. 14, Nr. 5-8. (1997) p. 596.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ford's research interests are in the field of "relationships between companies develop and how they can be managed effectively. It also involves issues of technological development within and between companies. I am currently working as part of the team on the "Newmark" project. This study is looking at ways in which complex networks of companies operate and how companies behave within them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bath.ac.uk/management/faculty/david_ford.html David Ford - University of Bath] at ''bath.ac.uk.''

# A European management approach needs to take into account the various [[cultures]] across [[Europe]] and how they impact business practice, to pinpoint cultural commonalities and particularities in different organizational environments and management habits.

'''Exxon''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|ɒ|n}} was the brand name of oil and natural resources company Exxon Corporation, prior to 1972 known as [[Standard Oil Company of New Jersey]]. In 1999, Exxon Corporation merged with [[Mobil]] to form [[ExxonMobil]]. The ''Exxon'' brand is still used by ExxonMobil's [[Downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] operations as a brand for certain gas stations, motor fuel and related products (the highest concentration of which are located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states). Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was one of the [[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]] that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to the ExxonMobil Historical Collection, 1790-2004: Part 1|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00352/cah-00352.html|website=Briscoe Center for American History|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Exxon replaced the [[Esso]], [[Enco (oil company)|Enco]], and [[Humble Oil|Humble]] brands in the United States in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1973/03/10/it-will-grow-on-you|title=IT WILL GROW ON YOU|last=Brooks|first=John|date=1973-03-03|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Esso name was a trademark of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, and attracted protests from other [[Standard Oil]] spinoffs because of its phonetic similarity to the acronym of the name of the parent company, Standard Oil. As a result, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was restricted from using Esso in the U.S., except in those states awarded to it in the [[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States|1911 Standard Oil antitrust settlement]].

In states where it was restricted from using the Esso name, the company marketed under the Humble or Enco brands. The Humble brand was used at Texas stations for decades, as those operations were under the direction of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey affiliate [[Humble Oil &amp; Refining Company]]. In the middle to late 1950s, use of the Humble brand spread to other southwestern states, including [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Oklahoma]].

In 1959, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey secured full control of Humble Oil and restructured it into its U.S. marketing and refining division, to market nationwide under the Enco, Esso and Humble brands. Enco was created as an acronym for the phrase "Energy Company". Humble introduced the Enco brand in 1960 in [[Oklahoma]] and surrounding states, to replace Humble's subsidiary Oklahoma and Pate brands. Humble also tried marketing under Enco in [[Ohio]], but [[Standard Oil of Ohio|Standard Oil Company of Ohio (Sohio)]] protested that the Enco name and logo (a white oval with blue border and red lettering) too closely resembled that of Esso. Consequently, stations in Ohio were rebranded as Humble, and remained so until the Exxon brand came into use.

After the Enco brand was discontinued in Ohio, it was moved to other non-Esso states. In 1961, Humble stations in Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and [[Texas]] were rebranded to Enco. That same year, Enco appeared on former Carter stations in the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest.

In 1963, Humble Oil and [[Tidewater Oil Company]] began negotiating a sale of Tidewater's West Coast refining and marketing operations. The sale would have given Humble Oil a large number of existing Flying A stations and distributorships, as well as a refinery in [[California]], the nation's fastest-growing gasoline market. However, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] objected to the sale on anti-trust grounds. (In 1966, [[Phillips Petroleum Company]] bought Tidewater's western properties and rebranded all Flying A outlets to [[Phillips 66]].)

Humble Oil continued to expand its West Coast operations, adding California to its marketing territory, building a large number of new Enco stations and rebranding others. In 1967, Humble Oil purchased all remaining Signal stations from [[Standard Oil Company of California]] ([[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]) and rebranded them as Enco outlets, greatly increasing Enco's presence in California. Finally, in 1969, Humble Oil opened a new refinery in [[Benicia, California]].

In 1966, the U.S. Justice Department ordered Humble Oil to "[[cease and desist]]" from using the Esso brand at stations in several southeastern states, following protests from [[Standard Oil of Kentucky]] (Kyso), which was a Standard Oil of California subsidiary in the process of rebranding its Standard stations to Chevron. By 1967, Humble Oil's Esso stations in the Southeast were rebranded to Enco.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, Humble Oil continued to have difficulties promoting itself as a nationwide marketer of petroleum products, despite a number of high-profile marketing strategies. These included the popular "Put a Tiger in Your Tank" advertising campaign and accompanying tiger mascot, introduced in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.exxonmobil.com/Corporate/history/about_who_history_alt.aspx| title=ExxonMobil - Our History| accessdate=2010-02-13}} And see also the fact, that almost at [[Newport Jazz Festival]] 1960 the musician [[Muddy Waters]] performed his hit "Put a Tiger in Your Tank", slating the Esso advert by applying the slogan to [[Gender|special masculinity's]] sexual wishes towards a woman, cf. {{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqnXT-Cgr2M| title=Muddy Waters - Tiger In Your Tank| accessdate=2010-02-13}} and its recording on the album ''[[At Newport 1960]]''. 1959 as the year of the final slogan message is also mentioned by: [[Brian Ash (bibliographer)|Brian Ash]], ''Tiger in Your Tank: The Anatomy of an Advertising Campaign'' (1969), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Different persons are credited with originating the slogan, such as Austrian born American-based psychologist and marketing expert [[Ernest Dichter]], British artist [[List of fictional tigers#Tigers in advertising|John Berry]] or Chicago copywriter Emery Smith, cf. http://www.petcaretips.net/famous_cats_tony_tiger.html--&gt; to promote Enco Extra and Esso Extra gasolines. Humble Oil also used similar logotypes, use of the Humble name in all Enco and Esso advertising, and uniform designs for all stations regardless of brand. In addition, Humble Oil was a major promoter and broadcast sponsor for college football in the Pacific-8 (now [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]]) and Southwestern conferences.

But Humble Oil still faced stiff competition from national brands such as [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Texaco]], which at that time was the only company to market under one brand name in all 50 states. By the late 1960s, Humble officials realized that the time had come to develop a new brand name that could be used nationwide.
[[File:ExxonGasKellerTX.jpg|thumb|220px|left|A Exxon gas station in [[Keller, Texas]] with a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store that opened in 2001.]]
At first, consideration was given to simply rebranding all stations as Enco, but that was shelved when it was learned that the word "Enco" is similar in pronunciation to the Japanese slang term ''enko'', meaning "stalled car" (an abbreviation of ''enjin no kosho'', "engine breakdown").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879122,00.html|title=On with Exxon|accessdate=2008-12-25|work=TIME|publisher=Time.com|date=1972-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Exxon was unveiled as the new, unified brand name for all former Enco and Esso outlets. At the same time, the company changed its corporate name from Standard Oil of New Jersey to Exxon Corporation. The rebranding came after successful test-marketing of the Exxon name, under two experimental logos, in the fall and winter of 1971–1972. Along with the new name, Exxon settled on a rectangular logo using red lettering and blue trim on a white background, similar to the familiar color scheme on the old Enco and Esso logos.

The company initially planned to change its name to "Exon", in keeping with the four-letter format of Enco and Esso. However, during the planning process, it was noted that [[j. James Exon|James Exon]] was the governor of Nebraska. Renaming the company after a sitting governor seemed ill-advised. George T. Piercy, a senior member of the board of directors suggested adding an X resulting in the new EXXON name.

The unrestricted international use of the popular Esso brand prompted Exxon to continue using it outside the U.S. Esso is the only widely used Standard Oil descendant brand left in existence. Others, such as [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], maintain a few Standard-branded stations in specific states in order to retain their trademarks and prevent others from using them.

==Exxon Office Systems==
Under the guidance of its paid consultants at Boston Consulting Group, Exxon announced in the 1970s that it would compete against IBM and Xerox.  The mantra was ‘Information Is the Oil of the 21st Century’.  It launched Exxon Office Systems, which predictably failed, since "the giant oil company failed to fully realize the subtleties of managing small high-tech companies."  In the early 1980's, Exxon retailed its fax machines and software through [[Sears]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=ANDREW POLLACK |title=EXXON CLOSES PLANT AND LAYS OFF 1,100 IN OFFICE COMPANY |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/02/business/exxon-closes-plant-and-lays-off-1100-in-office-company.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=2 December 1981 |quote=To beef up its marketing, Exxon is selling its electronic typewriters through Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company's new business equipment stores.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exxon announced the closure of the venture at the end of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=By Mark Potts |title=Exxon to Quit Office-Systems Business |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1984/11/28/exxon-to-quit-office-systems-business/16cdefe3-1664-48f9-9e8a-a3b6e51988ed/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5995c0a71e7f |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Washington Post |date=28 November 1984 |quote=Analysts repeatedly have rapped Exxon for its performance in office systems, saying that the giant oil company failed to fully realize the subtleties of managing small high-tech companies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jean-Louis Gassée |title=The Exxon Delusion |url=https://mondaynote.com/50-years-intech-part-4-the-exxon-delusion-d92ada84f6e |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=Monday Note |date=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent years==
In 1989, Exxon announced that it was moving its headquarters, including about 300 employees, from [[Manhattan]], New York City to the [[Las Colinas]] area of [[Irving, Texas]]. Exxon sold the [[Exxon Building (New York)|Exxon Building]] (1251 Avenue of the Americas), its former headquarters in [[Rockefeller Center]], to a unit of Mitsui Real Estate Development Co. Ltd. in 1986 for $610 million. John Walsh, president of Exxon subsidiary Friendswood Development Company, stated that Exxon left New York because the costs were too high.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Anne and Ralph Bivins. "[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1989_659330 Exxon moving corporate headquarters to Dallas]". ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. Friday October 27, 1989. A1. Retrieved on July 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Exxon partnered with Turner Ridge Capital Management to develop and finance their U.S. alternative energy infrastructure.

In 2016, ExxonMobil successfully asked a U.S. federal court to lift the aforementioned trademark injunction that banned it from using the Esso brand in various states. By this time, as a result of numerous mergers and rebranding, the remaining Standard Oil companies that previously objected to the Esso name had been acquired by [[BP]]. ExxonMobil cited trademark surveys in which there was no longer possible confusion with the Esso name as it was more than seven decades before. BP also had no objection to lifting the ban.&lt;ref name="CSP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cspdailynews.com/industry-news-analysis/corporate-news/articles/return-esso-gasoline|title=The Return of Esso Gasoline?|date=16 February 2016|publisher=CSP Daily News| accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ExxonMobil did not specify whether they would now open new stations in the U.S. under the Esso name; they were primarily concerned about the additional expenses of having separate marketing, letterheads, packaging, and other materials that omit "Esso".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.law360.com/articles/740293/after-78-years-exxon-asks-court-to-use-esso-name-again|title=After 78 Years, Exxon Asks Court To Use 'Esso' Name Again|date=21 December 2015|publisher=CSP Daily News| accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo==
[[File:Exxon logo.svg|thumb|Exxon's original logo, which began to be phased out in 2016.]]
The rectangular Exxon logo, with the blue strip at the bottom and red lettering with the two 'X's interlinked together, was designed by noted industrial stylist [[Raymond Loewy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5068132/raymond-loewy-the-man-who-designed-everything|title=Raymond Loewy: the man who designed everything|last=Savov|first=Vlad|date=2013-11-05|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interlinked 'X's are incorporated in the modern-day ExxonMobil corporate logo; in mid-2016, as part of a corporate rebranding accompanying the launch of ExxonMobil's "Synergy" fuel products, the mixed-case Exxon wordmark from the ExxonMobil corporate logo became the brand's main logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cspdailynews.com/fuels-news-prices-analysis/fuels-news/articles/exxonmobil-debuts-synergy-fuel-imaging|title=ExxonMobil Debuts Synergy Fuel, Imaging|work=CSP Daily News|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, [[Minolta]] introduced an autofocus SLR camera system named "Maxxum" in the United States. Originally, cameras (such as the [[Minolta Maxxum 7000|Maxxum 7000]]) lenses and flashes used a logo with the X's crossed in 'MAXXUM'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://basepath.com/images/PhotoArticles/big/MaxxumCrossedXX.jpg Minolta Maxxum camera with original crossed 'XX' logo]&lt;/ref&gt;  Exxon considered this a violation of their trademark, and as a result, Minolta was allowed to distribute cameras already produced, but was forced to change the stylistic 'XX' and implement this as a change in new production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://basepath.com/Photography/Minolta7000.php Minolta Maxxum camera with modified double 'X' logo]&lt;/ref&gt; ExxonMobil similarly sued [[21st Century Fox]] over its cable channel [[FXX]], but the parties agreed to dismiss the suit in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/fox-exxonmobil-hit-brakes-fxx-833113|title=Fox, ExxonMobil Hit Brakes on "FXX" Trademark Dispute|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Branding ==
[[File:Exxon footprint 2012-08.png|thumb|Map of Exxon stores in the United States]]

Exxon is ExxonMobil's primary retail gasoline brand in most of the United States, with the highest concentration of retail outlets located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states. The Exxon brand also has a market presence in the following metropolitan areas:

{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}

'''Factor analysis''' is a [[statistics|statistical]] method used to describe [[variance|variability]] among observed, correlated [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called '''factors'''. For example, it is possible that variations in six observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved (underlying) variables. Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved [[latent variable]]s. The observed variables are modelled as [[linear combination]]s of the potential factors, plus "[[errors and residuals in statistics|error]]" terms. Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables. The theory behind factor analytic methods is that the information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset. Factor analysis is commonly used in biology, [[psychometrics]], [[personality]] theories, [[marketing]], [[product management]], [[operations research]], and [[finance]]. Proponents of factor analysis believe that it helps to deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying/latent variables. It is one of the most commonly used inter-dependency techniques and is used when the relevant set of variables shows a systematic inter-dependence and the objective is to find out the latent factors that create a commonality.

Factor analysis is related to [[principal component analysis]] (PCA), but the two are not identical.&lt;ref name="Bartholomew2008"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bartholomew |first1=D.J. |last2=Steele |first2=F. |last3=Galbraith |first3=J. |last4=Moustaki |first4=I. |title=Analysis of Multivariate Social Science Data |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2008 |isbn=1584889608 |edition=2nd |series=Statistics in the Social and Behavioral Sciences Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been significant controversy in the field over differences between the two techniques (see section on [[#Exploratory factor analysis versus principal components analysis|exploratory factor analysis versus principal components analysis]] below). PCA can be considered as a more basic version of [[exploratory factor analysis]] (EFA) that was developed in the early days prior to the advent of high-speed computers. Both PCA and factor analysis aim to reduce the dimensionality of a set of data, but the approaches taken to do so are different for the two techniques. Factor analysis is clearly designed with the objective to identify certain unobservable factors from the observed variables, whereas PCA does not directly address this objective; at best, PCA provides an approximation to the required factors.&lt;ref name="Principal Component Analysis"&gt;Jolliffe I.T.

==Statistical model==

===Definition===
Suppose we have a set of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; '''observable random variables''', &lt;math&gt;x_1,\dots,x_p&lt;/math&gt; with means &lt;math&gt;\mu_1,\dots,\mu_p&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose for some unknown constants &lt;math&gt;l_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; unobserved random variables &lt;math&gt;F_j&lt;/math&gt; (called "'''common factors'''," because they influence all the observed random variables), where &lt;math&gt;i\in {1,\dots,p}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j \in {1,\dots,k},&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;p&lt;/math&gt;, we have

: &lt;math&gt;x_i-\mu_i=l_{i1} F_1 + \cdots + l_{ik} F_k + \varepsilon_i.\, &lt;/math&gt;

Here, the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; are '''unobserved stochastic error terms''' with zero mean and finite variance, which may not be the same for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

In matrix terms, we have

: &lt;math&gt;x-\mu=LF+\varepsilon. \,&lt;/math&gt;

If we have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; observations, then we will have the dimensions &lt;math&gt;x_{p\times n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_{p\times k}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F_{k\times n}&lt;/math&gt;. Each column of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; denotes values for one particular observation, and matrix &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; does not vary across observations.

Also we will impose the following assumptions on &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;:

# &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; are independent.
# &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}(F) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}(F)=I&lt;/math&gt; (to make sure that the factors are uncorrelated).

Any solution of the above set of equations following the constraints for &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ''factors'', and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; as the '''''loading matrix'''''.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}(x-\mu)=\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Then note that from the conditions just imposed on &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, we have

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}(x-\mu)=\mathrm{Cov}(LF+\varepsilon),\,&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = L \mathrm{Cov}(F) L^T + \mathrm{Cov}(\varepsilon),\,&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = LL^T + \Psi.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that for any [[orthogonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, if we set &lt;math&gt;L=LQ&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F=Q^T F&lt;/math&gt;, the criteria for being factors and factor loadings still hold. Hence a set of factors and factor loadings is unique only up to an [[orthogonal transformation]].

===Example===
Suppose a psychologist has the hypothesis that there are two kinds of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], "verbal intelligence" and "mathematical intelligence", neither of which is directly observed. [[Evidence]] for the hypothesis is sought in the examination scores from each of 10 different academic fields of 1000 students. If each student is chosen randomly from a large [[population (statistics)|population]], then each student's 10 scores are random variables. The psychologist's hypothesis may say that for each of the 10 academic fields, the score averaged over the group of all students who share some common pair of values for verbal and mathematical "intelligences" is some [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] times their level of verbal intelligence plus another constant times their level of mathematical intelligence, i.e., it is a combination of those two "factors". The numbers for a particular subject, by which the two kinds of intelligence are multiplied to obtain the expected score, are posited by the hypothesis to be the same for all intelligence level pairs, and are called '''"factor loading"''' for this subject. For example, the hypothesis may hold that the average student's aptitude in the field of [[astronomy]] is

:{10 × the student's verbal intelligence} + {6 × the student's mathematical intelligence}.

The numbers 10 and 6 are the factor loadings associated with astronomy. Other academic subjects may have different factor loadings.

Two students assumed to have identical degrees of the latent, unmeasured traits of verbal and mathematical intelligence may have different measured aptitudes in astronomy because individual aptitudes differ from average aptitudes and because of measurement error itself. Such differences make up what is collectively called the "error" — a statistical term that means the amount by which an individual, as measured, differs from what is average for or predicted by his or her levels of intelligence (see [[errors and residuals in statistics]]).

The observable data that go into factor analysis would be 10 scores of each of the 1000 students, a total of 10,000 numbers. The factor loadings and levels of the two kinds of intelligence of each student must be inferred from the data.

===Mathematical model of the same example===
In the following, matrices will be indicated by indexed variables. "Subject" indices will be indicated using letters a,b and c, with values running from 1 to &lt;math&gt;N_a&lt;/math&gt; which is equal to 10 in the above example.  "Factor" indices will be indicated using letters p, q and r, with values running from 1 to &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt; which is equal to 2 in the above example. "Instance" or "sample" indices will be indicated using letters i,j and k, with values running from 1 to &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt;. In the example above, if a sample of &lt;math&gt;N_i=1000&lt;/math&gt; students responded to the &lt;math&gt;N_a=10&lt;/math&gt; questions, the ''i''th student's score for the ''a''th question are given by &lt;math&gt;x_{ai}&lt;/math&gt;. The purpose of factor analysis is to characterize the correlations between the variables &lt;math&gt;x_a&lt;/math&gt; of which the &lt;math&gt;x_{ai}&lt;/math&gt; are a particular instance, or set of observations. In order for the variables to be on equal footing, they are normalized:
:&lt;math&gt;z_{ai}=\frac{x_{ai}-\mu_a}{\sigma_a}&lt;/math&gt;
where the sample mean is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_a=\tfrac{1}{N_i}\sum_i x_{ai}&lt;/math&gt;
and the sample variance is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_a^2=\tfrac{1}{N_i-1}\sum_i (x_{ai}-\mu_a)^2&lt;/math&gt;
The factor analysis model for this particular sample is then:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}z_{1,i} &amp; =  &amp; \ell_{1,1}F_{1,i} &amp; + &amp; \ell_{1,2}F_{2,i} &amp; + &amp; \varepsilon_{1,i} \\
\vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \vdots \\
z_{10,i} &amp; =  &amp; \ell_{10,1}F_{1,i} &amp; + &amp; \ell_{10,2}F_{2,i} &amp; + &amp; \varepsilon_{10,i}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

or, more succinctly:
:&lt;math&gt;
z_{ai}=\sum_p \ell_{ap}F_{pi}+\varepsilon_{ai}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;F_{1,i}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i''th student's "verbal intelligence",
* &lt;math&gt;F_{2,i}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''i''th student's "mathematical intelligence",
* &lt;math&gt;\ell_{ap}&lt;/math&gt; are the factor loadings for the ''a''th subject, for ''p'' = 1, 2.

In [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] notation, we have
:&lt;math&gt;Z=LF+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
Observe that by doubling the scale on which "verbal intelligence"—the first component in each column of ''F''—is measured, and simultaneously halving the factor loadings for verbal intelligence makes no difference to the model. Thus, no generality is lost by assuming that the standard deviation of the factors for verbal intelligence is 1. Likewise for mathematical intelligence. Moreover, for similar reasons, no generality is lost by assuming the two factors are [[uncorrelated]] with each other. In other words:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i F_{pi}F_{qi}=\delta_{pq}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{pq}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] (0 when &lt;math&gt;p \ne q&lt;/math&gt; and 1 when &lt;math&gt;p=q&lt;/math&gt;).The errors are assumed to be independent of the factors:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i F_{pi}\varepsilon_{ai}=0&lt;/math&gt;
Note that, since any rotation of a solution is also a solution, this makes interpreting the factors difficult. See disadvantages below. In this particular example, if we do not know beforehand that the two types of intelligence are uncorrelated, then we cannot interpret the two factors as the two different types of intelligence. Even if they are uncorrelated, we cannot tell which factor corresponds to verbal intelligence and which corresponds to mathematical intelligence without an outside argument.

The values of the loadings ''L'', the averages μ, and the [[variance]]s of the "errors" ε must be estimated given the observed data ''X'' and ''F'' (the assumption about the levels of the factors is fixed for a given ''F''). 
The "fundamental theorem" may be derived from the above conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i z_{ai}z_{bi}=\sum_p \ell_{ap}\ell_{bp}+\sum_i \varepsilon_{ai}\varepsilon_{bi}&lt;/math&gt;
The term on the left is the (a,b) term of the correlation matrix (an &lt;math&gt;N_a \times N_a&lt;/math&gt; matrix) of the observed data, and its &lt;math&gt;N_a&lt;/math&gt; diagonal elements will be 1's. The last term on the right will be a diagonal matrix with terms less than unity. The first term on the right is the "reduced correlation matrix" and will be equal to the correlation matrix except for its diagonal values which will be less than unity. These diagonal elements of the reduced correlation matrix are called "communalities" (which represent the fraction of the variance in the observed variable that is accounted for by the factors):
:&lt;math&gt;
h_a^2=1-\psi_a=\sum_p \ell_{ap}\ell_{ap}
&lt;/math&gt;
The sample data &lt;math&gt;z_{ai}&lt;/math&gt; will not, of course, exactly obey the fundamental equation given above due to sampling errors, inadequacy of the model, etc. The goal of any analysis of the above model is to find the factors &lt;math&gt;F_{pi}&lt;/math&gt; and loadings &lt;math&gt;\ell_{ap}&lt;/math&gt; which, in some sense, give a "best fit" to the data. In factor analysis, the best fit is defined as the minimum of the mean square error in the off-diagonal residuals of the correlation matrix:&lt;ref name="Harman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harman |first=Harry H. |year=1976 |title=Modern Factor Analysis |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=175, 176 |isbn=0-226-31652-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^2 = \sum_{ab,a\ne b} \left[\sum_i z_{ai}z_{bi}-\sum_p \ell_{ap}\ell_{bp}\right]^2&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to minimizing the off-diagonal components of the error covariance which, in the model equations have expected values of zero. This is to be contrasted with principal component analysis which seeks to minimize the mean square error of all residuals.&lt;ref name="Harman"/&gt; Before the advent of high speed computers, considerable effort was devoted to finding approximate solutions to the problem, particularly in estimating the communalities by other means, which then simplifies the problem considerably by yielding a known reduced correlation matrix. This was then used to estimate the factors and the loadings. With the advent of high-speed computers, the minimization problem can be solved iteratively with adequate speed, and the communalities are calculated in the process, rather than being needed beforehand. The [[Generalized minimal residual method|MinRes]] algorithm is particularly suited to this problem, but is hardly the only iterative means of finding a solution.

If the solution factors are allowed to be correlated (as in oblimin rotation, for example), then the corresponding mathematical model uses [[skew coordinates]] rather than orthogonal coordinates.

===Geometric interpretation===
[[File:FactorPlot.svg|thumb|350px|Geometric interpretation of Factor Analysis parameters for 3 respondents to question "a". The "answer" is represented by the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a&lt;/math&gt;, which is projected onto a plane defined by two orthonormal vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;. The projection vector is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a&lt;/math&gt; and the error &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to the plane, so that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a=\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a&lt;/math&gt;. The projection vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a&lt;/math&gt; may be represented in terms of the factor vectors as &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a=\ell_{a1}\mathbf{F}_1+\ell_{a2}\mathbf{F}_2&lt;/math&gt;. The square of the length of the projection vector is the communality: &lt;math&gt;|\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a|^2=h^2_a&lt;/math&gt;. If another data vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_b&lt;/math&gt; were plotted, the cosine of the angle between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_b&lt;/math&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;r_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; : the (a,b) entry in the correlation matrix. (Adapted from Harman Fig. 4.3)&lt;ref name="Harman"/&gt;]]

The parameters and variables of factor analysis can be given a geometrical interpretation. The data (&lt;math&gt;z_{ai}&lt;/math&gt;), the factors (&lt;math&gt;F_{pi}&lt;/math&gt;) and the errors (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ai}&lt;/math&gt;) can be viewed as vectors in an &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Euclidean space (sample space), represented as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Since the data are standardized, the data vectors are of unit length (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a\cdot\mathbf{z}_a=1&lt;/math&gt;). The factor vectors define an &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional linear subspace (i.e. a hyperplane) in this space, upon which the data vectors are projected orthogonally. This follows from the model equation 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a=\sum_p \ell_{ap} \mathbf{F}_p+\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a&lt;/math&gt;
and the independence of the factors and the errors: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_p\cdot\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a=0&lt;/math&gt;. In the above example, the hyperplane is just a 2-dimensional plane defined by the two factor vectors. The projection of the data vectors onto the hyperplane is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a=\sum_p \ell_{ap}\mathbf{F}_p&lt;/math&gt;
and the errors are vectors from that projected point to the data point and are perpendicular to the hyperplane. The goal of factor analysis is to find a hyperplane which is a "best fit" to the data in some sense, so it doesn't matter how the factor vectors which define this hyperplane are chosen, as long as they are independent and lie in the hyperplane. We are free to specify them as both orthogonal and normal (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_p\cdot \mathbf{F}_q=\delta_{pq}&lt;/math&gt;) with no loss of generality. After a suitable set of factors are found, they may also be arbitrarily rotated within the hyperplane, so that any rotation of the factor vectors will define the same hyperplane, and also be a solution. As a result, in the above example, in which the fitting hyperplane is two dimensional, if we do not know beforehand that the two types of intelligence are uncorrelated, then we cannot interpret the two factors as the two different types of intelligence. Even if they are uncorrelated, we cannot tell which factor corresponds to verbal intelligence and which corresponds to mathematical intelligence, or whether the factors are linear combinations of both, without an outside argument.

The data vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a&lt;/math&gt; have unit length. The correlation matrix for the data is given by &lt;math&gt;r_{ab}=\mathbf{z}_a\cdot\mathbf{z}_b&lt;/math&gt;. The correlation matrix can be geometrically interpreted as the cosine of the angle between the two data vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z}_b&lt;/math&gt;. The diagonal elements will clearly be 1's and the off diagonal elements will have absolute values less than or equal to unity. The "reduced correlation matrix" is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}_{ab}=\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a\cdot\hat{\mathbf{z}}_b&lt;/math&gt;.

The goal of factor analysis is to choose the fitting hyperplane such that the reduced correlation matrix reproduces the correlation matrix as nearly as possible, except for the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix which are known to have unit value.  In other words, the goal is to reproduce as accurately as possible the cross-correlations in the data. Specifically, for the fitting hyperplane, the mean square error in the off-diagonal components 
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^2=\sum_{a,b\ne a} \left(r_{ab}-\hat{r}_{ab}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

is to be minimized, and this is accomplished by minimizing it with respect to a set of orthonormal factor vectors. It can be seen that 
:&lt;math&gt;
r_{ab}-\hat{r}_{ab}= \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_a\cdot\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_b
&lt;/math&gt;

The term on the right is just the covariance of the errors. In the model, the error covariance is stated to be a diagonal matrix and so the above minimization problem will in fact yield a "best fit" to the model: It will yield a sample estimate of the error covariance which has its off-diagonal components minimized in the mean square sense. It can be seen that since the &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}_a&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal projections of the data vectors, their length will be less than or equal to the length of the projected data vector, which is unity. The square of these lengths are just the diagonal elements of the reduced correlation matrix. These diagonal elements of the reduced correlation matrix are known as "communalities":

:&lt;math&gt;
h_a^2=\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a\cdot\hat{\mathbf{z}}_a = \sum_p \ell_{ap}\ell_{ap}
&lt;/math&gt;

Large values of the communalities will indicate that the fitting hyperplane is rather accurately reproducing the correlation matrix. It should be noted that the mean values of the factors must also be constrained to be zero, from which it follows that the mean values of the errors will also be zero.

===Types of factor analysis===
[[Exploratory factor analysis]] (EFA) is used to identify complex interrelationships among items and group items that are part of unified concepts.&lt;ref name=Polit&gt;{{cite book |author=Polit DF Beck CT |title=Nursing Research: Generating and Assessing Evidence for Nursing Practice, 9th ed. |year=2012 |publisher=Wolters Klower Health, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researcher makes no ''a priori'' assumptions about relationships among factors.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt;

[[Confirmatory factor analysis]] (CFA) is a more complex approach that tests the hypothesis that the items are associated with specific factors.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt; CFA uses [[structural equation modeling]] to test a measurement model whereby loading on the factors allows for evaluation of relationships between observed variables and unobserved variables.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt;  Structural equation modeling approaches can accommodate measurement error, and are less restrictive than [[least-squares estimation]].&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt;  Hypothesized models are tested against actual data, and the analysis would demonstrate loadings of observed variables on the latent variables (factors), as well as the correlation between the latent variables.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt;

===Types of factor extraction===
[[Principal component analysis]] (PCA) is a widely used method for factor extraction, which is the first phase of EFA.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt; Factor weights are computed to extract the maximum possible variance, with successive factoring continuing until there is no further meaningful variance left.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt; The factor model must then be rotated for analysis.&lt;ref name=Polit/&gt;

Canonical factor analysis, also called Rao's canonical factoring, is a different method of computing the same model as PCA, which uses the principal axis method. Canonical factor analysis seeks factors which have the highest canonical correlation with the observed variables. Canonical factor analysis is unaffected by arbitrary rescaling of the data.

Common factor analysis, also called principal factor analysis (PFA) or principal axis factoring (PAF), seeks the least number of factors which can account for the common variance (correlation) of a set of variables.

Image factoring is based on the [[correlation matrix]] of predicted variables rather than actual variables, where each variable is predicted from the others using [[multiple regression]].

Alpha factoring is based on maximizing the reliability of factors, assuming variables are randomly sampled from a universe of variables. All other methods assume cases to be sampled and variables fixed.

Factor regression model is a combinatorial model of factor model and regression model; or alternatively, it can be viewed as the hybrid factor model,&lt;ref name="meng2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meng |first=J. |title=Uncover cooperative gene regulations by microRNAs and transcription factors in glioblastoma using a nonnegative hybrid factor model |journal=International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing |year=2011 |url=http://www.cmsworldwide.com/ICASSP2011/Papers/ViewPapers.asp?PaperNum=4439 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123144133/http://www.cmsworldwide.com/ICASSP2011/Papers/ViewPapers.asp?PaperNum=4439 |archivedate=2011-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose factors are partially known.

===Terminology===
Factor loadings: Commonality is the square of standardized outer loading of an item. Analogous to [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson's r]], the squared factor loading is the percent of variance in that indicator variable explained by the factor. To get the percent of variance in all the variables accounted for by each factor, add the sum of the squared factor loadings for that factor (column) and divide by the number of variables. (Note the number of variables equals the sum of their variances as the variance of a standardized variable is 1.) This is the same as dividing the factor's [[eigenvalue]] by the number of variables.

Interpreting factor loadings: By one rule of thumb in confirmatory factor analysis, loadings should be .7 or higher to confirm that independent variables identified a priori are represented by a particular factor, on the rationale that the .7 level corresponds to about half of the variance in the indicator being explained by the factor. However, the .7 standard is a high one and real-life data may well not meet this criterion, which is why some researchers, particularly for exploratory purposes, will use a lower level such as .4 for the central factor and .25 for other factors. In any event, factor loadings must be interpreted in the light of theory, not by arbitrary cutoff levels.

In [[Angle#Types of angles|oblique]] rotation, one may examine both a pattern matrix and a structure matrix. The structure matrix is simply the factor loading matrix as in orthogonal rotation, representing the variance in a measured variable explained by a factor on both a unique and common contributions basis. The pattern matrix, in contrast, contains [[coefficient]]s which just represent unique contributions. The more factors, the lower the pattern coefficients as a rule since there will be more common contributions to variance explained. For oblique rotation, the researcher looks at both the structure and pattern coefficients when attributing a label to a factor. Principles of oblique rotation can be derived from both cross entropy and its dual entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Liou | first=C.-Y. | last2=Musicus | first2=B.R. | title=Cross Entropy Approximation of Structured Gaussian Covariance Matrices |journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=3362–3367 |year=2008 |doi=10.1109/TSP.2008.917878 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=4545272&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communality: The sum of the squared factor loadings for all factors for a given variable (row) is the variance in that variable accounted for by all the factors, and this is called the communality. The communality measures the percent of variance in a given variable explained by all the factors jointly and may be interpreted as the reliability of the indicator in the context of the factors being posited.

Spurious solutions: If the communality exceeds 1.0, there is a spurious solution, which may reflect too small a sample or the choice to extract too many or too few factors.

Uniqueness of a variable: The variability of a variable minus its communality.

Eigenvalues/characteristic roots: Eigenvalues measure the amount of variation in the total sample accounted for by each factor. The ratio of eigenvalues is the ratio of explanatory importance of the factors with respect to the variables. If a factor has a low eigenvalue, then it is contributing little to the explanation of variances in the variables and may be ignored as less important than the factors with higher eigenvalues. 

Extraction sums of squared loadings: Initial eigenvalues and eigenvalues after extraction (listed by SPSS as "Extraction Sums of Squared Loadings") are the same for PCA extraction, but for other extraction methods, eigenvalues after extraction will be lower than their initial counterparts. SPSS also prints "Rotation Sums of Squared Loadings" and even for PCA, these eigenvalues will differ from initial and extraction eigenvalues, though their total will be the same.

Factor scores (also called component scores in PCA): are the scores of each case (row) on each factor (column). To compute the factor score for a given case for a given factor, one takes the case's standardized score on each variable, multiplies by the corresponding loadings of the variable for the given factor, and sums these products. Computing factor scores allows one to look for factor outliers. Also, factor scores may be used as variables in subsequent modeling. (Explained from PCA not from Factor Analysis perspective).

===Criteria for determining the number of factors===
Researchers wish to avoid such subjective or arbitrary criteria for factor retention as "it made sense to me". A number of objective methods have been developed to solve this problem, allowing users to determine an appropriate range of solutions to investigate. Methods may not agree. For instance, the parallel analysis may suggest 5 factors while Velicer's MAP suggests 6, so the researcher may request both 5 and 6-factor solutions and discuss each in terms of their relation to external data and theory.

====Modern criteria====
[[John L. Horn|Horn]]'s parallel analysis (PA): A Monte-Carlo based simulation method that compares the observed eigenvalues with those obtained from uncorrelated normal variables. A factor or component is retained if the associated eigenvalue is bigger than the 95th percentile of the distribution of eigenvalues derived from the random data. PA is one of the most recommended rules for determining the number of components to retain,{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} but many programs fail to include this option (a notable exception being [[R (programming language)|R]] ).&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal | last1 = Ledesma | first1 = R.D. | last2 = Valero-Mora | first2 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Determining the Number of Factors to Retain in EFA: An easy-to-use computer program for carrying out Parallel Analysis | url = http://pareonline.net/getvn.asp?v=12&amp;n=2 | journal = Practical Assessment Research &amp; Evaluation | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Anton Formann|Formann]] provided both theoretical and empirical evidence that its application might not be appropriate in many cases since its performance is considerably influenced by [[sample size]], [[Item response theory#The item response function|item discrimination]], and type of [[correlation coefficient]].&lt;ref&gt;Tran, U. S., &amp; Formann, A. K. (2009). Performance of parallel analysis in retrieving unidimensionality in the presence of binary data. ''Educational and Psychological Measurement, 69,'' 50-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Velicer's (1976) MAP test&lt;ref name=Velicer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Velicer|first=W.F.|title=Determining the number of components from the matrix of partial correlations|journal=Psychometrika|year=1976|volume=41|pages=321–327|doi=10.1007/bf02293557}}&lt;/ref&gt; “involves a complete principal components analysis followed by the examination of a series of matrices of partial correlations” (p.&amp;nbsp;397). The squared correlation for Step “0” (see Figure 4) is the average squared off-diagonal correlation for the unpartialed correlation matrix. On Step 1, the first principal component and its associated items are partialed out. Thereafter, the average squared off-diagonal correlation for the subsequent correlation matrix is then computed for Step 1. On Step 2, the first two principal components are partialed out and the resultant average squared off-diagonal correlation is again computed. The computations are carried out for k minus one step (k representing the total number of variables in the matrix). Thereafter, all of the average squared correlations for each step are lined up and the step number in the analyses that resulted in the lowest average squared partial correlation determines the number of components or factors to retain.&lt;ref name=Velicer/&gt; By this method, components are maintained as long as the variance in the correlation matrix represents systematic variance, as opposed to residual or error variance. Although methodologically akin to principal components analysis, the MAP technique has been shown to perform quite well in determining the number of factors to retain in multiple simulation studies.&lt;ref name="Warne, R.

==== Older methods ====
Kaiser criterion: The Kaiser rule is to drop all components with eigenvalues under 1.0 – this being the eigenvalue equal to the information accounted for by an average single  item. The Kaiser criterion is the default in [[SPSS]] and most [[statistical software]] but is not recommended when used as the sole cut-off criterion for estimating the number of factors as it tends to over-extract factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=D.L. |last1=Bandalos |first2=M.R. |last2=Boehm-Kaufman |chapter=Four common misconceptions in exploratory factor analysis |editor1-first=Charles E. |editor1-last=Lance |editor2-first=Robert J. |editor2-last=Vandenberg |title=Statistical and Methodological Myths and Urban Legends: Doctrine, Verity and Fable in the Organizational and Social Sciences |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFAnkvqD8CgC&amp;pg=PA61 |year=2008 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8058-6237-9 |pages=61–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variation of this method has been created where a researcher calculates [[confidence interval]]s for each eigenvalue and retains only factors which have the entire confidence interval greater than 1.0.&lt;ref name="Warne, R.

The Cattell scree test plots the components as the X axis and the corresponding [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalues]] as the [[Y-axis]].  As one moves to the right, toward later components, the eigenvalues drop. When the drop ceases and the curve makes an elbow toward less steep decline, Cattell's scree test says to drop all further components after the one starting the elbow.  This rule is sometimes criticised for being amenable to researcher-controlled "[[Wiktionary:fudge factor|fudging]]".  That is, as picking the "elbow" can be subjective because the curve has multiple elbows or is a smooth curve, the researcher may be tempted to set the cut-off at the number of factors desired by their research agenda.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Variance explained criteria: Some researchers simply use the rule of keeping enough factors to account for 90% (sometimes 80%) of the variation.  Where the researcher's goal emphasizes [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] (explaining variance with as few factors as possible), the criterion could be as low as 50%.

===Rotation methods===
The unrotated output maximizes variance accounted for by the first and subsequent factors, and forces the factors to be [[orthogonal]]. This data-compression comes at the cost of having most items load on the early factors, and usually, of having many items load substantially on more than one factor. Rotation serves to make the output more understandable, by seeking so-called "Simple Structure": A pattern of loadings where each item loads strongly on only one of the factors, and much more weakly on the other factors. Rotations can be orthogonal or oblique (allowing the factors to correlate).

[[Varimax rotation]] is an orthogonal rotation of the factor axes to maximize the variance of the squared loadings of a factor (column) on all the variables (rows) in a factor matrix, which has the effect of differentiating the original variables by extracted factor. Each factor will tend to have either large or small loadings of any particular variable. A varimax solution yields results which make it as easy as possible to identify each variable with a single factor. This is the most common rotation option. However, the orthogonality (i.e., independence) of factors is often an unrealistic assumption. Oblique rotations are inclusive of orthogonal rotation, and for that reason, oblique rotations are a preferred method.  Allowing for factors that are correlated with one another is especially applicable in psychometric research, since attitudes, opinions, and intellectual abilities tend to be correlated, and since it would be unrealistic in many situations to assume otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russell |first=D.W. |title=In search of underlying dimensions: The use (and abuse) of factor analysis in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=28 |issue=12 |pages=1629–46 |date=December 2002 |doi=10.1177/014616702237645 |url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/28/12/1629.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quartimax rotation is an orthogonal alternative which minimizes the number of factors needed to explain each variable. This type of rotation often generates a general factor on which most variables are loaded to a high or medium degree. Such a factor structure is usually not helpful to the research purpose.

Equimax rotation is a compromise between varimax and quartimax criteria.

Direct oblimin rotation is the standard method when one wishes a non-orthogonal (oblique) solution – that is, one in which the factors are allowed to be correlated. This will result in higher eigenvalues but diminished [[interpretability]] of the factors. See below.{{Clarify|date=May 2012}}

Promax rotation is an alternative non-orthogonal (oblique) rotation method which is computationally faster than the direct oblimin method and therefore is sometimes used for very large [[dataset]]s.

==In psychometrics==
{{see also|G factor (psychometrics)|label 1=''g'' factor}}

===History===
[[Charles Spearman]] pioneered the use of factor analysis in the field of psychology and is sometimes credited with the invention of factor analysis. He discovered that school children's scores on a wide variety of seemingly unrelated subjects were positively correlated, which led him to postulate that a general mental ability, or ''g'', underlies and shapes human cognitive performance. His postulate now enjoys broad support in the field of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence research]], where it is known as the [[General intelligence factor|''g'' theory]].

[[Raymond Cattell]] expanded on Spearman's idea of a two-factor theory of intelligence after performing his own tests and factor analysis. He used a multi-factor theory to explain intelligence. Cattell's theory addressed alternative factors in intellectual development, including motivation and psychology. Cattell also developed several mathematical methods for adjusting psychometric graphs, such as his "scree" test and similarity coefficients. His research led to the development of his theory of [[fluid and crystallized intelligence]], as well as his [[16 Personality Factors]] theory of personality. Cattell was a strong advocate of factor analysis and [[psychometrics]]. He believed that all theory should be derived from research, which supports the continued use of empirical observation and objective testing to study human intelligence.

===Applications in psychology===
Factor analysis is used to identify "factors" that explain a variety of results on different tests. For example, intelligence research found that people who get a high score on a test of verbal ability are also good on other tests that require verbal abilities. Researchers explained this by using factor analysis to isolate one factor, often called [[crystallized intelligence]] or verbal intelligence, which represents the degree to which someone is able to solve problems involving verbal skills.

Factor analysis in psychology is most often associated with intelligence research. However, it also has been used to find factors in a broad range of domains such as personality, attitudes, beliefs, etc. It is linked to [[psychometrics]], as it can assess the validity of an instrument by finding if the instrument indeed measures the postulated factors.

===Advantages===
* Reduction of number of variables, by combining two or more variables into a single factor. For example, performance at running, ball throwing, batting, jumping and weight lifting could be combined into a single factor such as general athletic ability. Usually, in an item by people matrix, factors are selected by grouping related items. In the Q factor analysis technique, the matrix is transposed and factors are created by grouping related people: For example, liberals, [[Libertarianism|libertarians]], conservatives and socialists, could form separate groups.
* Identification of groups of inter-related variables, to see how they are related to each other. For example, Carroll used factor analysis to build his [[Three Stratum Theory]]. He found that a factor called "broad visual perception" relates to how good an individual is at visual tasks. He also found a "broad auditory perception" factor, relating to auditory task capability. Furthermore, he found a global factor, called "g" or general intelligence, that relates to both "broad visual perception" and "broad auditory perception". This means someone with a high "g" is likely to have both a high "visual perception" capability and a high "auditory perception" capability, and that "g" therefore explains a good part of why someone is good or bad in both of those domains.

===Disadvantages===
* "...each orientation is equally acceptable mathematically. But different factorial theories proved to differ as much in terms of the orientations of factorial axes for a given solution as in terms of anything else, so that model fitting did not prove to be useful in distinguishing among theories." (Sternberg, 1977&lt;ref name=Sternberg&gt;{{cite book |last=Sternberg |first=R. J. |title=Metaphors of Mind: Conceptions of the Nature of Intelligence |year=1977 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=85–111 |isbn= }}{{Verify source|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This means all rotations represent different underlying processes, but all rotations are equally valid outcomes of standard factor analysis optimization. Therefore, it is impossible to pick the proper rotation using factor analysis alone.
* Factor analysis can be only as good as the data allows. In psychology, where researchers often have to rely on less valid and reliable measures such as self-reports, this can be problematic.
* Interpreting factor analysis is based on using a "heuristic", which is a solution that is "convenient even if not absolutely true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factor Analysis |accessdate=July 22, 2004 |url=http://comp9.psych.cornell.edu/Darlington/factor.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040818062948/http://comp9.psych.cornell.edu/Darlington/factor.htm |archivedate=August 18, 2004 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; More than one interpretation can be made of the same data factored the same way, and factor analysis cannot identify causality.

==Exploratory factor analysis versus principal components analysis==
{{see also|Principal component analysis|Exploratory factor analysis}}
While [[exploratory factor analysis]] and [[principal component analysis]] are treated as synonymous techniques in some fields of statistics, this has been criticised (e.g. Fabrigar et al., 1999;&lt;ref name=Fabrigar&gt;{{cite web|last=Fabrigar|title=Evaluating the use of exploratory factor analysis in psychological research.|year=1999|url=http://www.statpower.net/Content/312/Handout/Fabrigar1999.pdf|publisher=Psychological Methods|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suhr, 2009&lt;ref name=Suhr&gt;{{cite web|last=Suhr|first=Diane|year=2009|title=Principal component analysis vs. exploratory factor analysis|url=http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/203-30.pdf|publisher=SUGI 30 Proceedings|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In factor analysis, the researcher makes the assumption that an underlying causal model exists, whereas PCA is simply a variable reduction technique.&lt;ref name=Sas&gt;{{cite web|title=Principal Components Analysis|url=http://support.sas.com/publishing/pubcat/chaps/55129.pdf|work=SAS Support Textbook|author=SAS Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have argued that the distinctions between the two techniques may mean that there are objective benefits for preferring one over the other based on the analytic goal.  If the factor model is incorrectly formulated or the assumptions are not met, then factor analysis will give erroneous results. Factor analysis has been used successfully where adequate understanding of the system permits good initial model formulations. Principal component analysis employs a mathematical transformation to the original data with no assumptions about the form of the covariance matrix. The aim of PCA is to determine a few linear combinations of the original variables that can be used to summarize the data set without losing much information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meglen|first1=R.R. |title=Examining Large Databases: A Chemometric Approach Using Principal Component Analysis|journal=Journal of Chemometrics |volume=5 |issue=3|pages=163–179 |date=1991 |doi=10.1002/cem.1180050305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments contrasting PCA and EFA ===
Fabrigar et al. (1999)&lt;ref name=Fabrigar /&gt; address a number of reasons used to suggest that principal components analysis is not equivalent to factor analysis:

# It is sometimes suggested that principal components analysis is computationally quicker and requires fewer resources than factor analysis. Fabrigar et al. suggest that the ready availability of computer resources have rendered this practical concern irrelevant.
# PCA and factor analysis can produce similar results. This point is also addressed by Fabrigar et al.; in certain cases, whereby the communalities are low (e.g., .40), the two techniques produce divergent results. In fact, Fabrigar et al. argue that in cases where the data correspond to assumptions of the common factor model, the results of PCA are inaccurate results.
# There are certain cases where factor analysis leads to 'Heywood cases'. These encompass situations whereby 100% or more of the [[variance]] in a measured variable is estimated to be accounted for by the model. Fabrigar et al. suggest that these cases are actually informative to the researcher, indicating a misspecified model or a violation of the common factor model. The lack of Heywood cases in the PCA approach may mean that such issues pass unnoticed.
# Researchers gain extra information from a PCA approach, such as an individual's score on a certain component – such information is not yielded from factor analysis. However, as Fabrigar et al. contend, the typical aim of factor analysis – i.e. to determine the factors accounting for the structure of the [[Correlation and dependence|correlations]] between measured variables – does not require knowledge of factor scores and thus this advantage is negated. It is also possible to compute factor scores from a factor analysis.

=== Variance versus covariance ===
Factor analysis takes into account the [[random error]] that is inherent in measurement, whereas PCA fails to do so. This point is exemplified by Brown (2009),&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=J. D.|title=Principal components analysis and exploratory factor analysis – Definitions, differences and choices.|date=January 2009|url=http://jalt.org/test/PDF/Brown29.pdf|publisher=Shiken: JALT Testing &amp; Evaluation SIG Newsletter|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who indicated that, in respect to the correlation matrices involved in the calculations:

{{Quotation|"In PCA, 1.00s are put in the diagonal meaning that all of the variance in the matrix is to be accounted for (including variance unique to each variable, variance common among variables, and error variance). That would, therefore, by definition, include all of the variance in the variables. In contrast, in EFA, the communalities are put in the diagonal meaning that only the variance shared with other variables is to be accounted for (excluding variance unique to each variable and error variance). That would, therefore, by definition, include only variance that is common among the variables."|Brown (2009)|Principal components analysis and exploratory factor analysis – Definitions, differences and choices}}

For this reason, Brown (2009) recommends using factor analysis when theoretical ideas about relationships between variables exist, whereas PCA should be used if the goal of the researcher is to explore patterns in their data.

===Differences in procedure and results===
The differences between principal components analysis and factor analysis are further illustrated by Suhr (2009):&lt;ref name=Suhr /&gt;
* PCA results in principal components that account for a maximal amount of variance for observed variables; FA account for common variance in the data.
* PCA inserts ones on the diagonals of the correlation matrix; FA adjusts the diagonals of the correlation matrix with the unique factors.
* PCA minimizes the sum of squared perpendicular distance to the component axis; FA estimates factors which influence responses on observed variables.
* The component scores in PCA represent a linear combination of the observed variables weighted by [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]]; the observed variables in FA are linear combinations of the underlying and unique factors.
* In PCA, the components yielded are uninterpretable, i.e. they do not represent underlying ‘constructs’; in FA, the underlying constructs can be labeled and readily interpreted, given an accurate model specification.

==In marketing==
The basic steps are:
* Identify the salient attributes consumers use to evaluate [[product (business)|products]] in this category.
* Use [[quantitative marketing research]] techniques (such as [[statistical survey|surveys]]) to collect data from a sample of potential [[customer]]s concerning their ratings of all the product attributes.
* Input the data into a statistical program and run the factor analysis procedure. The computer will yield a set of underlying attributes (or factors).
* Use these factors to construct [[perceptual mapping|perceptual maps]] and other [[positioning (marketing)|product positioning]] devices.

=== Information collection ===
The data collection stage is usually done by marketing research professionals. Survey questions ask the respondent to rate a product sample or descriptions of product concepts on a range of attributes. Anywhere from five to twenty attributes are chosen. They could include things like: ease of use, weight, accuracy, durability, colourfulness, price, or size. The attributes chosen will vary depending on the product being studied. The same question is asked about all the products in the study. The data for multiple products is coded and input into a statistical program such as [[R (programming language)|R]], [[SPSS]], [[SAS System|SAS]], [[Stata]], [[STATISTICA]], JMP, and SYSTAT.

=== Analysis ===
The analysis will isolate the underlying factors that explain the data using a matrix of associations.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, N. (2012). A comparison of distribution-free and non-distribution free methods in factor analysis. Paper presented at Southwestern Educational Research Association (SERA) Conference 2012, New Orleans, LA (ED529153).&lt;/ref&gt; Factor analysis is an interdependence technique. The complete set of interdependent relationships is examined. There is no specification of dependent variables, independent variables, or causality. Factor analysis assumes that all the rating data on different attributes can be reduced down to a few important dimensions. This reduction is possible because some attributes may be related to each other. The rating given to any one attribute is partially the result of the influence of other attributes. The statistical algorithm deconstructs the rating (called a raw score) into its various components, and reconstructs the partial scores into underlying factor scores. The degree of correlation between the initial raw score and the final factor score is called a ''factor loading''.

===Advantages===
* Both objective and subjective attributes can be used provided the subjective attributes can be converted into scores.
* Factor analysis can identify latent dimensions or constructs that direct analysis may not.
* It is easy and inexpensive.

===Disadvantages===
* Usefulness depends on the researchers' ability to collect a sufficient set of product attributes.  If important attributes are excluded or neglected, the value of the procedure is reduced.
* If sets of observed variables are highly similar to each other and distinct from other items, factor analysis will assign a single factor to them.  This may obscure factors that represent more interesting relationships. {{Clarify|date=May 2012}}
* Naming factors may require knowledge of theory because seemingly dissimilar attributes can correlate strongly for unknown reasons.

==In physical and biological sciences==
Factor analysis has also been widely used in physical sciences such as [[geochemistry]],  [[hydrochemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Subbarao |first1=C. |last2=Subbarao |first2=N.V. |last3=Chandu |first3=S.N. |title=Characterisation of groundwater contamination using factor analysis |journal=Environmental Geology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=175–180 |date=December 1996 |doi=10.1007/s002540050091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[astrophysics]] and [[cosmology]], as well as biological sciences, such as [[ecology]], [[molecular biology]] and [[biochemistry]].

In groundwater quality management, it is important to relate the spatial distribution of different chemical
parameters to different possible sources, which have different chemical signatures. For example, a sulfide mine is likely to be associated with high levels of acidity, dissolved sulfates and transition metals. These signatures can be identified as factors through R-mode factor analysis, and the location of possible sources can be suggested by contouring the factor scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Love |first1=D. |last2=Hallbauer |first2=D.K. |last3=Amos |first3=A. |last4=Hranova |first4=R.K. |title=Factor analysis as a tool in groundwater quality management: two southern African case studies |journal=Physics and Chemistry of the Earth |volume=29 |issue= |pages=1135–43 |year=2004 |doi=10.1016/j.pce.2004.09.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geochemistry]], different factors can correspond to different mineral associations, and thus to mineralisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barton |first1=E.S. |last2=Hallbauer |first2=D.K. |title=Trace-element and U—Pb isotope compositions of pyrite types in the Proterozoic Black Reef, Transvaal Sequence, South Africa: Implications on genesis and age |journal=Chemical Geology |volume=133 |issue= |pages=173–199 |year=1996 |doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(96)00075-7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In microarray analysis==
Factor analysis can be used for summarizing high-density [[oligonucleotide]] [[DNA microarrays]] data at probe level for [[Affymetrix]] GeneChips. In this case, the latent variable corresponds to the [[RNA]] concentration in a sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Sepp |last1=Hochreiter |first2=Djork-Arné |last2=Clevert |first3=Klaus |last3=Obermayer |title=A new summarization method for affymetrix probe level data |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=943–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16473874 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btl033 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/8/943.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
Factor analysis has been implemented in several statistical analysis programs since the 1980s:

*[[BMDP]]
*[[JMP (statistical software)]]
*[[Python (programming language)|Python]]: module [[Scikit-learn]]&lt;ref&gt;http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.FactorAnalysis.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[R (programming language)|R]] (with the base function ''factanal'' or ''fa'' function in package '''psych'''). Rotations are implemented in the ''GPArotation'' R package.
*[[SAS (software)|SAS]] (using PROC FACTOR or PROC CALIS)

'''Félicien Kabuga''' (born 1935) is a Rwandan businessman, accused of bankrolling and participating in the [[Rwandan genocide]].

==Early life==
Kabuga was born in Muniga, in the [[Commune (administrative division)|commune]] of Mukarange, [[prefecture]] of Byumba, present-day Rwanda. Kabuga amassed his wealth by owning tea farms in northern Rwanda, among other business ventures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpxy4NxqboQ&amp;feature=relmfu|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multimillionaire,&lt;ref name=Economistfall&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9441341 How the mighty are falling], ''The Economist'', 5 July 2007. Accessed online 17 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; he was closely connected to [[Juvénal Habyarimana]]'s [[Mouvement républicain national pour la démocratie et le développement|MRND]] party and the [[Akazu]], an informal group of Hutu extremists from northern Rwanda that strongly contributed to the Rwandan genocide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kabuga was also allegedly heavily involved in the founding and bankrolling of [[RTLM]], as well as [[Kangura]] magazine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trialinternational.org/latest-post/felicien-kabuga/|title=Felicien Kabuga - TRIAL International|work=TRIAL International|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, at an RTLM fundraising meeting organised by the MRND, Felicien Kabuga allegedly publicly defined the purpose of RTLM as the defence of [[Hutu Power]].&lt;ref&gt;ICTR Case No. 99-52-T; The Prosecutor against Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, Amended Indictment, pg. 19, 6.4; http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/ICTR/BARAYAGWIZA_ICTR-99-52/Judgment_&amp;_Sentence_ICTR-99-52-T.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[ICTR]]'s so-called "media trial", former RTLM presenter [[Georges Ruggiu]] named Kabuga as the "Chairman Director-general" of the station, with duties such as "presiding over RTLM" and "representing RTLM."&lt;ref&gt;ICTR-99-52-T Prosecution Exhibit P 91B; "A DOCUMENT TITLED RTLM ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE RUGGIUS REPRESENTATION.PDF"&lt;/ref&gt;

From January 1993 to March 1994, a total of 500,000 [[machetes]] were imported into Rwanda, statistically one for every three adult Hutus in the country. Kabuga has been named as one of the main importers of these machetes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, Martin (2006). ''[[The State of Africa]]'', p. 501. Simon &amp; Schuster UK Ltd., London. {{ISBN|978-0-7432-3222-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kabuga is married to Josephine Mukazitoni. Two of their daughters are married to two of Habyarimana's sons.&lt;ref name="unictr.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-chronicles.net/index.php/features/685-where-is-rwandas-most-wanted-fugitive-kabuga.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indictment by ICTR==
On 29 August 1998, the prosecutor of the [[ICTR|United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]], [[Carla Del Ponte]] indicted Kabuga. In the amended indictment dated 1 October 2004, prosecutor [[Hassan Jallow]] charged Kabuga with:
* Conspiracy to commit genocide
* Genocide, or alternatively
* Complicity in genocide
* Direct and public incitement to commit genocide

In June 1994, after Rwanda was conquered by the [[Rwandese Patriotic Front|RPF]], Kabuga fled the country. He first attempted to enter [[Switzerland]], but was ordered to leave. He went to [[Kinshasa]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and was later believed to be residing in [[Nairobi]], Kenya.

In September 1995, before any indictment and before he was named as a suspected planner of the genocide, Kabuga registered and ran a business named 'Nshikabem Agency' in Nairobi, operating out of the Kilimani area located along Nairobi’s Lenana Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Criminal Tribunal For Rwanda: Delayed Justice|url=http://cms.crisisgroup.org/africa/central-africa/rwanda/international-criminal-tribunal-rwanda-delayed-justice|language=en|date=7 June 2001|work=[[International Crisis Group]]|page=16n31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpxy4NxqboQ|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech given on 28 August 2006 during his visit to Kenya, then US Senator [[Barack Obama]] accused Kenya of "allowing him [Kabuga] to purchase safe haven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

According to June 2008 reports by a Norwegian-based blogger calling himself African Press International (API), Kabuga was in hiding in [[Oslo]], and might be seeking to turn himself in. Authorities dismissed this claim as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2458892.ece|title=Rwandan war criminal reportedly in Oslo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603110323/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2458892.ece|archive-date=3 June 2008|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=- Etterlyst krigsforbryter oppholder seg i Norge|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/6zyPO/--Etterlyst-krigsforbryter-oppholder-seg-i-Norge|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=1 June 2008|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KTN news network in Kenya reported on 14 June 2008 that Kabuga had been arrested by Kenya Police the day before and was being held at Gigiri Police Station in [[Nairobi]]. Later, the suspect was found to be a local university lecturer, not Kabuga as previously thought, and released. It is suspected that Kabuga is in Kenya,&lt;ref name=iopqz&gt;{{cite news |last=Nyawo |first=James |date=4 August 2011 |title=Risking Irrelevance: The Threat of Impunity to the African Union |url=http://jurist.org/forum/2011/08/james-nyawo-africa-justice.php |publisher=[[JURIST]] |access-date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to be running businesses and enjoying protection from either the Kenyan government or some influential figures within the country.&lt;ref name=iopqz /&gt;

== History ==

=== Early history ===
{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}
In 1924, Alexander Richardson Grant, a 26 year old senior accountant with Ernst &amp; Ernst (later Ernst &amp; Young) decided to leave the firm and start his own business with William O’Brien. Alexander Grant &amp; Co. was built in Chicago and it provided services as a middle market firm.  The firm was growing rapidly and nationally under the guidance of several new leaders during the next three decades.

In 1961, the company established its national office in Chicago and earned net revenue of more than $5 million. During this time, a competitive firm that was also committed to providing services to middle market established in Europe, and this firm later became known as Binder Dijker Otte &amp; Co. ([[BDO International|BDO]]).

During the mid-1960s, the firm decided to expand its business internationally. In 1969, Alexander Grant &amp; Co. merged with companies from Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom to form an organization called Alexander Grant Tansley Witt.

By 1980, Alexander Grant &amp; Co. had joined with 49 international accounting firms, including a UK firm named Thornton Baker, and formed a professional global network, Grant Thornton International.

[[File:Discover Scuba Diving -- St. Croix, US Virgin Islands.jpg|thumb|Discover Scuba Diving in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands]]
'''Introductory diving''', also known as '''trial diving''' and '''resort diving''' are dives where people without diver training or certification can experience [[scuba diving]] under the guidance of a recreational [[diving instructor]].&lt;ref name="Schnuppertauchen" /&gt; Introductory diving is an opportunity for interested people to find out by practical experience if they would be interested in greater involvement in scuba diving.&lt;ref name="dsd2" /&gt; For scuba instructors and diving schools is it an opportunity to acquire new customers. An introductory diving experience is much less time-consuming and costly than the completion of [[autonomous diver]] training, but has little lasting value, as it is an experience program only, for which no certification is issued. Introductory scuba diving experiences are intended to introduce people to recreational diving, and increase the potential client base of dive shops to include people who do not have the time or inclination to complete an entry level certification program.

== Procedure ==
[[File:PADI-Ausbildungssystem.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|PADI education system]]
Participants are usually required to read and sign waivers to minimise liability of the program provider, and to provide a declaration that they do not suffer from any medical condition listed that would be an unacceptable risk for diving. Prior to the dive itself, an instructor teaches essential theoretical knowledge, so that the participants can dive with a low level of risk, and with informed consent. After putting on the necessary [[diving equipment]], the participant enters the water under close supervision of the instructor. First of all, breathing from the [[Diving regulator|scuba regulator]] is practiced at the water surface. At shallow water depth, some scuba skills are learned: Clearing the [[diving mask]], removing the regulator from the mouth and replacing and clearing it of water. These two skills are essential for the safety of the participants. Afterwards, there may be an opportunity to either play underwater games or explore the surroundings in shallow water. Trial diving usually takes about two to four hours.&lt;ref name="dsd"/&gt;

The participant learns the basic minimum safety guidelines and skills needed to dive under the direct supervision of a diving professional. If an open water dive is included, a few more basic skills will be practiced in confined water. The course includes:&lt;ref name="discover"/&gt;
*Introduction to the scuba equipment used to dive and how to move around underwater using the equipment.
*Breathing underwater on open circuit scuba and how to avoid [[barotrauma]].
*Learning some of the key skills that are used during every scuba dive.
*Swimming around and exploring within the limits of the program and the local environment.
*Information on how to enroll in a training course to become a certified entry-level recreational scuba diver through the providing agency.

=== Venue ===
Usually the introductory diving first takes place in ''[[Underwater diving#Diving environment|confined water]]'', which usually means a [[swimming pool]] or a very shallow and safe place in a [[lake]] or the [[sea]]. Depending on the offer, after the first dive in confined water, a second or further shallow dives may be done in suitable confined or open water.&lt;ref name="dsd2" /&gt;

===Altitude and flying after diving===
{{see also|Decompression practice#Flying and ascent to altitude after diving}}
People can go directly from high altitude to scuba diving, but should not scuba dive then go up in altitude without allowing an interval, depending on the time and depth of the dive, to reduce risk of [[decompression sickness]]. The [[Divers Alert Network]] (DAN) Flying after Diving workshop of 2002 recommended a 12-hour surface interval for uncertified individuals who took part in an introductory scuba experience before flying or ascending to an altitude greater than, or [[cabin pressure]] less than, an altitude equivalent of {{convert|2000|feet|meters}}.&lt;ref name="DAN-FAD 2002" /&gt;

== Prerequisites ==
[[File:CMAS-Ausbildung.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|CMAS education system]]
The diving school may ask that the participants of the trial dive prove their [[medical fitness to dive]] with a medical certificate, but more commonly they will use a standardized form for the participant to declare their self assessment of fitness to dive.

From the age of 8 years it is possible to take part in an introductory dive,&lt;ref name="Schnuppertauchen"/&gt; but some providers require a greater age. The participant should be able to swim at least {{convert|25|m|ft}} without any buoyancy aid.

== Introductory diving programs==
The international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]&amp;nbsp;11121&lt;ref name="ISO-Introductory" /&gt; standardizes the minimum requirements for an "Introductory Training Program". Despite the standardization, the title and contents of the program vary depending on the provider and their membership of a [[List of diver certification organizations|diver certification agency]]. The following programs are based on ISO&amp;nbsp;11121.

=== CMAS ===
The [[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques|CMAS]] Introductory Scuba Experience participants should be at least 14 years of age and able to swim.&lt;ref name="cmas" /&gt; The "Introductory Scuba Experience" includes a theory lesson, a confined water dive where several diving skills are practiced and an open water dive to a maximum depth of {{convert|10|m}}.

=== NAUI ===
Participants in a [[National Association of Underwater Instructors|NAUI]] Try scuba / Passport Diver program must be at least 10 years old. However, it is possible to take part in a confined water dive from the age of 8 years. The "Try scuba" program includes a theory lesson and a confined water dive where participants practice several dive skills and one or more open water dives. The first open water dive has recommended depth limit of {{convert|6|m}}. For further dives there is a limit of {{convert|12|m}}. Participants who have completed two open water dives will receive an "NAUI Passport Diver" confirmation. It enables them to participate in further open water introductory dives later on, guided by a NAUI instructors, without repeating the confined water dive.&lt;ref name="naui" /&gt;

=== NAUI Tandem Diver ===
The "Tandem Diver" program is an alternative to the "NAUI Try scuba" and differs mainly by the individual supervision of the participant and lack of the opportunities offered by the "NAUI Passport Diver".&lt;ref name="naui" /&gt;

=== PADI ===
[[File:SSI-education system.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|SSI education system]]
Participants in a [[PADI Discover Scuba Diving]] program should be at least 10 years old and should be able to swim.&lt;ref name="padidsd" /&gt; The "Discover Scuba Diving" program includes a theory lesson and a confined water dive where basic diving skills are practiced. Afterwards, one or more directly supervised open water dives can be done to a maximum depth of {{convert|12|m}}. Discover Scuba Diving includes the theoretical content and skills of the first lesson of the [[Open Water Diver|PADI Open Water Diver]] course, and this experience may be credited as the first confined water dive of a PADI [[Open Water Diver]] course if done within for one year,&lt;ref name="dsd" /&gt;

The PADI Discover Scuba Diving course allows for repetitive diving experiences within a time limit at the discretion of the dive instructor and dive shop.  This is a common request for people who try diving, then want to repeat the activity (often at a different location).

=== PADI Bubblemaker ===
The "Bubblemaker" program is a trial dive in the swimming pool for children from 8 years of age. The participants are introduced to scuba diving in a playful way by a scuba instructor.&lt;ref name="padimanual " /&gt; The maximum allowed diving depth is {{convert|2|m|ft|0}}.&lt;ref name="padibubblemaker" /&gt;

=== [[Scuba Schools International|SSI]] Try scuba ===
Participants must be at least 8 years old. The "Try scuba" course takes place in confined water and includes a theory session.&lt;ref name="SSI" /&gt; The participant may be submerged to a maximum depth of {{convert|5|m}}.&lt;ref name="SSI"/&gt;

=== SSI Try Scuba Diving ===
Participants must be at least 10 years old. SSI "Try Scuba Diving" is similar to the Try Scuba (Pool) program. The main difference is that it includes an open water dive and can be credited towards an [[Open Water Diver|SSI Open Water Diver]] course later. For open water dives there is a depth limit of {{convert|12|m}}.&lt;ref name="ssitsd" /&gt;

== Other types of introductory diving ==
There are programs for advanced divers that are also called introductory diving. These include programs that allow an experienced diver to try out [[technical diving]],&lt;ref name="tec" /&gt; [[rebreather]],&lt;ref name="Rebreather " /&gt; or [[cave diving]].&lt;ref name="hoehle" /&gt;

'''James A. Kelly Jr.''' (May 11, 1926 – August 9, 2013) was an American politician who served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] from 1959 to 1965 and the [[Massachusetts Senate]] from 1965 to 1979. In 1983, he was convicted of extortion.

==Early life==
Kelly was born on May 11, 1926 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] to James and Florence Kelly.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt;&lt;ref name=PublicOfficers /&gt; During [[World War II]] he served in the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite news|title=James A. Kelly (In Memoriam)|newspaper=The Gazette|date=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Becker College|Becker Junior College]] and in 1950 earned a [[Bachelor of Applied Arts]] from [[Clark University]].&lt;ref name=PublicOfficers&gt;{{cite book|title= Public Officers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1977-1978|url=https://archive.org/stream/publicofficersof19771978bost#page/54/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Clark, Kelly met and married Elisabeth Kelly. He became a [[Certified Public Accountant]] and established a practice in [[Leicester, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt;

==Political career==
Prior to becoming a state legislator, Kelly served one term on the Leicester School Committee and was clerk and treasurer of the [[Oxford, Massachusetts|Oxford]] – Rochdale Sewer District.&lt;ref name=PublicOfficers /&gt;

In 1958, Kelly was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives by defeating Republican incumbent [[John E. Riley (Massachusetts politician)|John E. Riley]] 6456 votes to 6045.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Election Statistics Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1958|url=https://archive.org/stream/electionstatisti19571958mass#page/328/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later he ran for the 4th Worcester District Senate seat that was being vacated by [[Joseph Gibney]]. He won a five-way Democratic primary with 37% of the vote and won the general election with 66%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Election Statistics Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1964|url = https://archive.org/stream/electionstatisti1964mass#page/476/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1965 to 1971, Kelly chaired the Joint Committee on State Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davidson|first=Sara|title=State Welfare Reform Urged|newspaper= The Boston Globe|date=August 23, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, he also chaired the Special Committee Special Senate Committee to investigate the activities of the commissioner of administration, John J. McCarthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='...No Evidence Selection of Ritchie Was Dictated'|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date= December 27, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this role, Kelly had an opportunity to bring down the administration of popular Republican Governor [[John A. Volpe]]. However, Kelly, according to a Volpe aide, assisted the governor's team by keeping them abreast of what was going on behind the scenes and assisting them in planning their strategy. Many, including fellow committee member [[Beryl Cohen]], believed that Kelly leaked a damaging report to the Volpe administration, which gave it time to counterattack. After the investigation, Kelly enjoyed a close relationship with Volpe's Commissioner of Administration and Finance Anthony DeFalco and was able to get patronage from the Volpe's administration.&lt;ref name="Oxford's Kelly back in the spotlight" /&gt; In 1971, Kelly backed [[Kevin B. Harrington]] for the Senate Presidency over Ways and Means Committee Chairman James F. Burke. Harrington defeated Burke and chose Kelly to replace Burke as Chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, one of the most powerful positions in the legislature.&lt;ref name="State house bills await chairman Kelly's nod"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kenney|first=Michael|title=State house bills await chairman Kelly's nod|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 11, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure in the legislature, Kelly was described as businesslike, accessible, and accommodating and was the only legislative leader to openly describe himself as a liberal.&lt;ref name=Budget&gt;{{cite news|last=Kenney|first=Michael|title= Enter Kelly---with a budget|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=May 2, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; He increased funding for existing social welfare programs and budgeted money for new ones, eliminated funding for the [[Massachusetts State Police]]'s [[Red squad|Subversive Activities Control Unit]], supported of constructing a new stadium, opposed using state funds to pay for desegregation in Boston Public Schools, and played a major role in establishing the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Were There Two Sen. Kellys?|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=April 2, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=William J.|title=Greater Boston Will Have Sports Stadium|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=June 10, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Kelly opposes state funds for Boston desegregation|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=May 2, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly was honored by Massachusetts [[Fair Share Action|Fair Share]], [[Public Interest Research Group]], and [[Americans for Democratic Action]] for his work for the poor, elderly, and disabled.&lt;ref name="Oxford's Kelly back in the spotlight"&gt;{{cite news|last=Farrell|first=David|title=Oxford's Kelly back in the spotlight|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 30, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his power as Chairman of Ways and Means and his effectiveness as a member of the Senate leadership, Kelly was widely known as the "Wizard of Oxford".

In 1976, federal prosecutors sought to have Kelly named as an unindicted co-conspirator for his role in the [[MBM scandal]]. According to Anthony Mansueto, one of MBM's senior vice presidents, Kelly told him that he had talked with Senator [[Joseph DiCarlo]], chairman of a special legislative committee investigating one of the company's contracts, and "For $100,000, MBM's problems could be solved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=William F.|title=Sen. Kelly named co-conspirator in extortion case|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 26, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Judge [[Walter Jay Skinner]] ruled that the prosecution had failed to link Kelly to the conspiracy and ordered that all references to him be removed from the indictment (Kelly's name was replaced with "[[John Doe]]" in the indictment).&lt;ref name=Hogarty&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogarty|first=Richard A.|title=Massachusetts Politics and Public Policy: Studies in Power and Leadership|year=2002|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|pages=242–246|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PUp71Q9xngAC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sen. Kelly won't seek re-election" /&gt; During the MBM investigation, it was also alleged that Kelly had endorsed a $2,000 check from MBM to Boston Mayor [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]] and that Kelly himself had received a $1,000 from MBM. Campaign contributions from corporations were illegal in Massachusetts. Kelly denied the allegations and the state declined to prosecute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=David|title=White says he knows nothing about check|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 10, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State won't charge Kelly in check case|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 26, 1978|author=Robert L. Turner|author2=Robert J. Rosenthal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 1977, Kelly announced that he would not run for reelection in 1978. He said that although the MBM scandal had no effect on him in his district, it likely meant that he could never advance in the Senate leadership. It was also possible that [[William Bulger]], who was likely to become the next Senate President, would not allow Kelly to remain as Ways and Means Chairman.&lt;ref name="Sen. Kelly won't seek re-election"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lockman|first=Norman|title=Sen. Kelly won't seek re-election|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=December 16, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his departure from the Senate, Kelly moved to [[Miami Beach, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Five Main Actors in an Unlovely Story|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=July 20, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Kelly and his wife had eight children (five sons and three daughters). One of his daughters died as an infant.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt;

In 1970, Kelly and his wife separated.&lt;ref name="Kelly enjoys competition but craves the victories" /&gt; After their separation, Kelly moved to the [[Jamaicaway]] Towers in [[Boston]]. While residing in Boston he was known to have breakfast at [[Taj Boston|the Ritz]], drive a [[Mercedes-Benz]], go out with young women, and play a daily game of squash at the [[Harvard Club of Boston]].&lt;ref name=Budget /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly enjoys competition but craves the victories"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sales|first=Bob|title=Kelly enjoys competition but craves the victories|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=July 1, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extortion case==
In 1980, Worcester architect Frank Masiello testified before the [[Ward Commission|Special Commission Concerning State and County Buildings]] that his company paid Kelly's accounting firm a $500 monthly retainer after Kelly threatened to have his firm's contracts with the state cancelled. The payments allegedly began in January 1971 when Kelly became chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and ended in September 1976. He also stated that his company paid for Kelly's travel, entertainment, and YMCA memberships. Kelly's firm received a total of $9,500, but never performed any work for Masiello and Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Nick|title=Kelly's Firm Paid $9500, Says Masiello|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 31, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; James L. Bauchat of Masiello and Associates' parent company Kassuba Development Corp., testified that Kelly demanded $10,000 in exchange for state design contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Walter V.|title=Witness Says Kelly Solicited $10,000|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=April 8, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly appeared before the Commission on June 27, 1980, [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Self-incrimination|pleaded the Fifth Amendment]] and refused to answer any questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kelly Takes the Fifth, Won't Answer Probe Panel's Queries|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=June 27, 1980|author=Ray Richard|author2=Walter V. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 1980, Kelly was indicted on charges of extorting $34,500 from Masiello and Associates. The indictment was based on the [[Hobbs Act]], which makes it illegal for a public official to solicit money from people trying to influence his official conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury indicts Kelly in payoff case|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=September 24, 1980|author=William F. Doherty|author2=Walter V. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 30 he pleaded not guilty and was released by [[United States magistrate judge]] [[Peter W. Princi]] on $10,000 bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=William F.|title=Kelly pleads not guilty of extortion|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=September 30, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; His trial began on March 18, 1981 and ended on April 29. After eleven hours of deliberation, the jury remained deadlocked 11 to 1 for conviction. Judge [[Joseph L. Tauro]] declared a mistrial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=William F.|title=Citing ties, prosecutor may ask judge in Kelly trial to step down|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=June 2, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the retrial, the prosecution attempted to have Tauro removed from the case, citing his pro-defense rulings during the trial and having received assistance from Kelly when Kelly was chair of a committee investigating the Volpe administration and Tauro was Volpe's chief legal counsel. The United States Court of Appeals ruled that there was no legal basis to bar Tauro from presiding over the retrial. Also prior to the retrial, two of the prosecution's witnesses had committed [[perjury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=William|title=Court says Tauro can preside at Kelly retrial|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=December 8, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hammond|first=James|title=Judge refuses to quash Kelly trial|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=July 27, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly's retrial began on November 15, 1982, and ended on December 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=William F.|title=Ex-senator Kelly retrial to begin|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=November 14, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=William F.|title=Kelly Jury Deliberates Into Night|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=December 23, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the jury found Kelly guilty of extortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=William F.|title=Kelly Found Guilty|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=December 23, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 1983, Judge [[Rya W. Zobel]] sentenced him to two years in prison.&lt;ref name="Kelly Given Two Years For $35,500 Extortion"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kelly Given Two Years For $35,500 Extortion|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 20, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was allowed to remain out of prison until the outcome of his appeal, which was rejected on December 1, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Doherty|first=William F.|title=Ex-Sen. Kelly's Bribe Appeal Denied|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=December 1, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly then sought to have his sentence delayed until April 1984 so he could complete his studies for a master's degree in business administration at [[Florida International University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Sen. Kelly Requests Delay of Prison Term|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=December 30, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request was denied and Kelly began his sentence in March 1984. He was incarcerated in [[Federal Prison Camp, Eglin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Short Circuits|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 18, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
Kelly spent his later years in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. He died on August 9, 2013 in [[Aurora, Colorado]], from complications following a hip fracture. He was buried in Leicester, Massachusetts, near his parents and daughter.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt;

He was the head of the [[Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co.]] as well as director of numerous companies.

'''Ulysses Lee''' "'''Junior'''" '''Bridgeman''' (born September 17, 1953) is an [[Americans|American]] businessman and former professional [[basketball]] player.

==High school career==
Born in [[East Chicago, Indiana]], Bridgeman was a member of the 1971 East Chicago Washington High School Senators basketball team, which went undefeated (29-0) and won the Indiana state high school basketball championship. Among his teammates were his brother Sam, [[Pete Trgovich]] (who played at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]) and [[Tim Stoddard]] ([[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|N.C. State]]), who would go on to have success as a [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]].

==College and professional career==
A {{height|ft=6|in=5}} tall [[guard (basketball)|guard]]/[[forward (basketball)|forward]] from the [[University of Louisville]], Bridgeman was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in [[1975 NBA Draft|1975]] and immediately traded with [[Brian Winters]], [[David Meyers (basketball)|David Meyers]] and [[Elmore Smith]] to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] for [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. Bridgeman went on to have a solid 12-year NBA career, spent mostly with the Bucks, and he scored 11,517 total points. Although he was a sixth man for most of his career, he averaged double figures in scoring for nine consecutive seasons. He played in 711 games for the Bucks, still the most in franchise history, although he started only 105 times.

==Post-playing career==
During the off-seasons of his playing career, Bridgeman used to work and learn the business model of [[Wendy's]] fast food restaurant franchise. After retiring from the NBA, he started owning various Wendy's and [[Chili's]] restaurants, and then sold them in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=David |title=How A Former NBA Player Turned $350,000 into $400 Million |url=https://www.themaven.net/blackwealthchannel/investing/how-a-former-nba-player-turned-350-000-into-400-million-FyRtXUpz5E6XFmVi6NhedA/ |website=Black Wealth Channel |accessdate=September 4, 2018 |date=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schuyler |first1=David |title=Junior Bridgeman selling restaurant franchises to become Coca-Cola distributor |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2016/04/20/junior-bridgeman-selling-restaurant-franchises-to.html |website=www.bizjournals.com |accessdate=September 4, 2018 |date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Bridgeman became a bottler for [[The Coca-Cola Company]],&lt;ref name="Coca Cola"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mandel |first1=Eric |title=NBA legend, NHL entrepreneur joint venture completes Coca-Cola's bottling overhaul |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2018/03/09/nba-legend-nhl-entrepreneur-joint-venture.html |website=www.bizjournals.com |accessdate=September 4, 2018 |date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2018, he signed a letter of intent to buy bottling operations in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="Coca Cola" /&gt;

==Honors==
Bridgeman's no. 2 jersey was retired by the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in 1988. He was inducted into the [[Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame]] in 1999.

==Personal life==
Bridgeman is a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartfordalphas.com/alphaphialpha.php?ID=3 |title=Hartford Alphas |accessdate=October 15, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712054014/http://www.hartfordalphas.com/alphaphialpha.php?ID=3 |archivedate=July 12, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2016, Bridgeman was appointed to the University of Louisville Board of Trustees by Governor of Kentucky [[Matt Bevin]] following an administrative reorganization in which Bevin abolished the university's former governing board. The appointment of the new board, including Bridgeman, was challenged by the state's Attorney General [[Andy Beshear]] on grounds that the governor did not have the power to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/32335039/gov-matt-bevin-names-10-new-appointments-to-u-of-l-board-of-trustees |title=Gov.

'''Lim Chin Tsong''' ({{zh|c=林振宗|p=Lín Zhènzōng|poj=Lîm Chín-chong}}; {{lang-my|လင်းချင်းချောင်း}}) was a [[Burmese Chinese]] tycoon and merchant, with business interests ranging from rice to oil. Throughout his career, he served as the sole partner of Lim Soo Hean &amp; Company, originally established by his father, a Chinese emigre to Burma.

During his own lifetime he was known as the most successful Chinese merchant in Rangoon. He entertained the social elite of the city in lavish parties hosted at his residence, Chin Tsong Palace, and gave generously to charities, including a hospital, a temple, and several schools. In modern Yangon, he is mostly remembered for the sudden and mysterious circumstances of his bankruptcy and death.

==Life==

===Background===
Lim was born on October 28, 1867 to Lim Soo Hean (林仕興), a Chinese man of [[Hokkien]] origin who migrated from [[Xiamen]] to Burma in 1861,&lt;ref&gt;''The Straits Times'' 1923&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after the family arrived in Burma from China.&lt;ref name="Latham98"&gt;Latham 98&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving from China, his father apprenticed for a Chinese milling firm before beginning his own business, originally importing goods from China and the [[Straits Settlements]].&lt;ref name="Wright307"&gt;Wright 307&lt;/ref&gt; He later established a rice trading firm, "Lim Soo Hean" (林仕興商行).&lt;ref name="sury"&gt;Suryadinata 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, Lim's father also began marketing oil, with Lim working as his assistant.&lt;ref name="TBW2"&gt;''The Bull Wheel 2''&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim's father, believing that his own poor English ability was hampering his ability to do business, sent Lim to the best English-language schools in Yangon. Lim attended [[Rangoon College]] and [[Basic Education High School No. 6 Botataung|St. Paul's School]] (now BEHS No. 6 Botataung).&lt;ref name="Wright307"/&gt; He also spoke Chinese, but was not [[literate]] in the language.&lt;ref name="TBW2"/&gt;

===Career===
[[File:Lim Chin Tsong Palace entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Lim Chin Tsong Palace in 1945.]]

In 1888 Lim's father died. Lim took over his father's company and expanded from the rice trade to petroleum.&lt;ref name="Latham98"/&gt; In 1891, he became the exclusive local agent of the [[Burmah Oil|Burmah Oil Company]], handling the internal distribution of oil throughout Burma. After acquiring a fleet of steamships he also began exporting oil to [[Penang]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shantou]] and [[Xiamen]].&lt;ref&gt;Latham 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; Lim played a prominent role in negotiating the oil company's rights to extract oil from properties in Upper Burma, and was rewarded with a small commission from every barrel produced from those wells.&lt;ref name="TBW5"&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim diversified his business interests into [[rubber plantation]]s, [[cotton gin]]s, peanut mills, and into earth metal extraction, including tin, copper, lead, wolfram and gold.&lt;ref name="latham99"&gt;Latham 99&lt;/ref&gt; Besides exporting oil, his steamships carried passengers, especially labourers from [[Fujian]].&lt;ref name="Wright309"&gt;Wright 309&lt;/ref&gt; Lim owned a match factory whose matches were favored by the viceroy of India, [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 4&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1900s, in which Lin was one of the most prominent merchants in Rangoon, he donated generously to schools and hospitals.&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt; Before 1910 a biographer noted that he led the local the Chinese community to contribute generously to the upkeep of a maternity hospital.&lt;ref name="Wright309"/&gt; In 1897 he donated the resources of his steamship company to have materials for [[Guanyin Gumiao Temple|Rangoon's Guanyin temple]] shipped from China.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 64&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, Lim and his partners established Anglo-Chinese Boys' and Girls' Schools in Rangoon (中華義學). In 1907, Lim founded the Lim Chin Tsong School (林振宗中西學校).&lt;ref name="sury"/&gt; Lim's schools employed teachers hired from England, and the quality of education was good enough that some families from Hong Kong and Macau sent their children to be educated there.&lt;ref name="Zaw"&gt;Zaw&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of Lim's schools, by teaching Chinese students in English, was to increase the competitiveness of Chinese businessmen and professionals abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim Chin Tsong maintained good relations with the social and economic elite of colonial Burma. He was made an honorary magistrate, sat on the Rangoon Municipal Committee,&lt;ref name="Wright309"/&gt; and served as a member of the [[Legislative Council of Burma]].&lt;ref name="TBW2"/&gt; In 1919, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire]] for his fundraising efforts during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt; The funds raised by Lim included his donation of a steamship, which entered service as the HMAT A49 ''Seang Choon''. The ship transported a regiment of [[Australian light horse]] to the battlefields of WWI in 1916. It was later sunk by a torpedo off the coast of Ireland on July 10, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;''Australian Light Horse Studies Center''&lt;/ref&gt; Lim owned the Rangoon Turf Club, a racing stable.&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt;

===Decline and fall===
Lim's financial fortunes declined drastically following WWI. He had been in heavy debt since at least 1911, and by 1914 all of his properties and businesses were mortgaged. In 1915 he won a civil suit over the cancellation of a steam ship charter, but he used the money to import a [[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost]] from England. In 1919 his lack of ability to repay what he owed to the Burmah Oil Company led the company to cease employing him as an agent. He also lost enough money through gambling and by making bad loans for his business associates to criticize him for it. Later in 1919, Lim took his family, relatives, and friends on a five-month vacation to England, where they lived and spent lavishly. Lim hoped that the value of the freight he carried back from England would be sufficient to clear his debts, but his hopes were not fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim attempted to corner the local rice market in 1921. His resulting monopoly led to a sharp increase in the price of rice, which led the British government to ban the exportation of rice outside of India (which Burma was then a part of). Because of this ban, the rice market in Burma collapsed.&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt; By 1922 he was on the verge of bankruptcy. By 1923 he was evading arrest, never appearing in public while refusing to answer the door or answer phone calls. There was an application to the High Court of Burma asking that he be judged insolvent, the proceedings of which Lim did not attend. The court agreed to temporarily halt the trial and to renew efforts to arrest Lim, when he died suddenly in November 2, 1923.&lt;ref name="TBW6"&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim died in his sleep, possibly of a heart attack.&lt;ref name="lath"&gt;Latham &amp; Heite 135&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of his death he had been suffering from [[influenza]] and fever. Before his death he had been notified that the telephone company had threatened to cut his phone service due to non-payment of fees, and his resulting distress may have contributed to his death.&lt;ref name="TBW7"&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 7&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the timing of his death, some people speculated that he had committed suicide.&lt;ref name="Roberts42"&gt;Roberts 42&lt;/ref&gt; His estate was declared insolvent on June 10, 1924, shortly following his death.&lt;ref name="lath"/&gt;

==Chin Tsong Palace==
[[File:Lim Chin Tsong Palace.jpg|thumb|Lim Chin Tsong Palace in 1920]]

Between 1915 and 1918,&lt;ref name="Roberts42"/&gt; Lim built a lavish residence in the Golden Valley area of Rangoon at a cost of over 2,000,000 rupees. The building includes a mixture of Eastern and Western architectural styles, and its five-story tower was built to resemble the Fu Xing Pavilion in the [[Summer Palace]], in [[Beijing]]. Building material was imported from both China and Italy, and foreign artists were employed to decorate its interior. The most notable artists to work on the building included the English painters [[Dod Procter|Dod]] and [[Ernest Procter]].&lt;ref name="Zaw"/&gt; The fusion of Chinese and Western architectural elements was not unusual in other British colonies with strong Chinese communities (such as [[Penang]] and [[Melaka]]), but was unique in Rangoon.&lt;ref name="Roberts42"/&gt;

The original name of the property was "Mount Pleasant",&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;Shaw&lt;/ref&gt; but after it construction the property became popularly known as "Chin Tsong Palace".&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt; After the construction of Chin Tsong Palace, Lim and his wife regularly threw lavish parties and entertained the social elite of Rangoon.&lt;ref name="TBW6"/&gt; The most notable guest entertained by Lim at the residence was [[Georges Clemenceau]], who visited Burma in 1920.&lt;ref name="Zaw"/&gt;

During the [[Japanese occupation of Burma]], from 1941–45, the house was the headquarters for a Japanese radio station that broadcast propaganda, the "All Burma Broadcasting Station". Following Japan's defeat the house was owned by an Indian businessman, before being nationalized by the newly-independent Burmese government in 1950. After the Burmese government took ownership of the house, they turned it into a guesthouse and changed its official name to "Kanbawza Yeiktha". In the late 1960s the building was converted into a hostel for female students attending the Institute of Economics and the [[University of Yangon|Rangoon Arts and Science University]], which were nearby. Today, the house is used as an office and arts school by the Fine Arts Department of [[Ministry of Culture (Myanmar)|Myanmar's Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name="Zaw"/&gt;

In 2015 the Chin Tsong Palace was designated a heritage site by Myanmar's Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref name="Zaw"/&gt; It is undergoing renovations and, as of 2017, remains open to the public. The renovations are scheduled to be completed in 2018, on the 100th anniversary of its construction.&lt;ref name="Downing"&gt;Downing&lt;/ref&gt; After the renovations, the Ministry of Culture plans to open the space as a cultural center.&lt;ref&gt;Than&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Lim was married to Tan Guat Tean (Po U in Burmese). She was illiterate, required an assistant to write and read for her, and signed her name with an "X".&lt;ref name="TBW7"/&gt; The couple had 8 children, including Lim Kar Chang, Lim Kar Hin, Lim Kar Kim, Lim Kar Taik, Lim Kar Tye, and Lim Gaik Kee. His second eldest son, Lim Kar Hin, died on 11 November 1916, preceding his father.&lt;ref&gt;''Straits Times'' 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

He sent his sons to be educated in England.&lt;ref name="TBW5"&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 5&lt;/ref&gt; After Lim's death, many of his children left Burma, and his descendants now live in various [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, including [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Lim and his family were generally popular during his later life. When his eldest son was married (in the newly-completed Chin Tsong Palace), all of the notable European and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] residents of Rangoon attended. The day after the wedding, another wedding party was held in which all of the notable Burmese residents of Rangoon attended. Two days after the initial wedding, another party was held in which the notable Muslim members of the city attended. Finally, three days after the wedding, another party was held in which all of the notable Chinese people in Rangoon attended.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bull Wheel'' 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lim Chin Tsong's death, Lim Kar Chang, Lim's eldest son, took over the management of his company. Lim Kar Chang attempted to ameliorate his father's debts partially through repossession of property and businesses and partially through applying to have them written off.&lt;ref name="TBW7"/&gt; Despite Lim's efforts, the legal ownership of his properties was still in the process of litigation by at least 1929.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Lim's bank, Xie De Yuan (協德園), was acquired by [[Nam Hwa Bank]], a Japanese-owned firm, after it went bankrupt.&lt;ref name="sury"/&gt;

In 1938, executives at the Burmah Oil Company discovered that Lim's widow, Tan Guat Tean, though still living in Chin Tsong Palace, was destitute. Reminded of the long association that had existed between Lim and the company in its early years, they arranged for a modest payment to be made to provide for her well-being, which she received in January 1938.&lt;ref name="TBW7"/&gt;

==Legacy==
During his lifetime Lim was known for kindness and generosity among the Chinese community in Rangoon, and he donated a percentage of his commissions to maintaining schools for Chinese students.&lt;ref name="TBW5"/&gt; Today, Lim is not well known in Myanmar, and those who do know him mostly know that he was very wealthy, but that he died in ignominious circumstances. Among the [[Chinese people in Myanmar|Sino-Burmese]] community of Yangon, Lim is remembered as a man whose fall was partially caused by his hubris: in China, an [[Bagua|octagonal tower]] was only constructed by those with claims to imperial authority; by building his home in such a shape, believers in [[Feng shui|Chinese geomancy]] claim that he overstepped his place in the world and unwittingly caused his own demise. As a wealthy Chinese man from a colonial era, most modern Burmese people feel they have little connection to Lim.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 45&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lim's death, many stories circulated orally among the residents of Yangon concerning the sudden circumstances of his financial ruin and death. According to popular lore, Lim ran a counterfeiting operation from a secret chamber under his estate, and the construction of his residence included a network of secret tunnels leading to [[Inya Lake]], which were used to dispose of bodies. In popular legends, his sudden financial ruin is explained as being the result of a betrayal by a foreign wife employed by a [[Special Branch#United Kingdom|police special branch]], who uncovered his counterfeiting operation and reported him to the British authorities.&lt;ref name="Downing"/&gt;

Possibly corroborating these stories, a jockey living on Lim's estate, Thein Pe, claimed to have discovered Lim's counterfeiting operation shortly before his financial difficulties became acute, forcing Thein Pe to quickly pack his belongings and "flee".&lt;ref&gt;Win&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Lim's death, there was a foreign woman living on his estate who may have been close to him ("Miss Hannah Boudeville"). She went to court to challenge Lim's creditors' legal right to repossess her home, claiming that Lim had given the house to her as a gift.&lt;ref name="latham99"/&gt;

As executive producer of ''The Alzheimer's Project'', Shriver earned two [[Emmy Awards]] and an [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] award for developing a "television show with a conscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2010/05/glee-cory-monteith-kevin-mchale-chris-colfer-mark-salling-maria-shriver-al-gore-television-academy-h.html |title=TV academy honors 'television with a conscience' |publisher= |accessdate=October 8, 2014 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is related to the [[Kennedy family]]; her mother, [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]], was a sister of [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and [[Ted Kennedy]]. Shriver is currently a special anchor and correspondent for [[NBC News]].

==Early life==
Shriver was born in [[Chicago]], Illinois, the second child and only daughter of the politician [[Sargent Shriver]] and activist [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]]. Shriver is a niece of United States President [[John F. Kennedy]], [[U.S. Attorney General]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]], U.S. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], and five other prominent siblings. A Roman Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Winfrey |first=Oprah |url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Oprah-Interviews-Maria-Shriver/2 |title=Oprah Talks to Maria Shriver |work=[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] |quote= |date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is of mostly [[Irish American|Irish]] and [[German American|German]] descent.

Shriver attended [[Westland Middle School]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and graduated in 1973 from [[Stone Ridge School of the Sacred Heart]] in Bethesda. She attended [[Manhattanville College]] for two years, then transferred and went on to receive a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[American studies]] from [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., in June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shriverreport.com/awn/contributors.php About the Contributors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504134055/http://www.shriverreport.com/awn/contributors.php |date=May 4, 2011 }} ''[[The Shriver Report]]''.

Accessed May 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Media career and advocacy===
In her book ''[[Ten Things I Wish I'd Known Before I Went Out Into The Real World]]'' (2000), Shriver says that she became passionate about [[broadcast journalism]] after being sent to the back of the campaign plane with the [[press corps]] while volunteering for her father's [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 U.S. vice presidential race]], calling these orders "the best thing that ever happened to me." After her journalism career began with [[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, she co-anchored ''[[The Early Show|The CBS Morning News]]'' with [[Forrest Sawyer]] from August 1985 until August 1986, co-anchored [[NBC News]]'s ''[[Weekend Today|Sunday Today]]'' from 1987 until 1990. Shriver also served as Saturday anchor  from 1989–1990 of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]''. She was a contributing anchor on ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' from 1992 until 2004. In August 2003, Shriver took an unpaid leave of absence from NBC News when her husband became a candidate in the [[California gubernatorial recall election, 2003|2003 California gubernatorial recall election]].

Following her husband's November 17, 2003, inauguration as the 38th Governor of California, she became the First Lady of California. She then returned to reporting, making two more appearances for ''Dateline NBC''.

On February 3, 2004, Shriver asked to be "relieved of [her] duties at NBC News," citing concerns the network had over the conflict of interest between her role as a journalist and her status as the First Lady of California and her increasing role as an advocate of her husband's administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,587213,00.html |title=Terminated |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=February 4, 2004 |accessdate=July 23, 2012 |author=Susman, Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved on August 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
McCaskey, son of current Bears principal owner [[Virginia Halas McCaskey]], is the oldest grandchild of [[George Halas]]. He became president of the Bears in 1983 after Halas' death. McCaskey held that post until 1999, when he succeeded his father [[Ed McCaskey|Ed]] as Chairman of the Board until 2011. He is the brother of current Bears Chairman [[George McCaskey]].

McCaskey frequently clashed with [[Mike Ditka]], who had been hired by Halas, but the volatile coach retained his job with an extension in 1984; The Bears won [[Super Bowl XX]] the following season. McCaskey finally fired Ditka after a losing season in 1992. Ditka's replacement was McCaskey's first coaching hire, [[Dave Wannstedt]], who was a heavily-sought-after candidate by several teams. However, after a 1994 playoff appearance, the Bears posted more losing seasons; Wannstedt was fired after the 1998 season and, after a botched hiring of [[Dave McGinnis]], McCaskey was stripped of much of his operational responsibilities and limited to the position of chairman of the board.

McCaskey is an alumnus of the [[Weatherhead School of Management]], at [[Case Western Reserve University]]. He served in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.whatlike.story&amp;story_id=544&amp;assign_cat_id=2&amp;dis_code=0 | title = Peace Corps Turning 40 | accessdate = 2010-09-15 | last = Kelly | first = Michael | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527232401/http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.whatlike.story&amp;story_id=544&amp;assign_cat_id=2&amp;dis_code=0 | archivedate = 2010-05-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught at the business schools at UCLA and Harvard University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1138367/10/index.htm | title = The Owners | accessdate = 2010-09-15 | last = Steinbreder | first = John | work = Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to becoming president of the Bears.

'''North Coast Harbor''' is a district in [[Downtown Cleveland|downtown]] [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] on the shore of [[Lake Erie]]. The district serves as the home of the [[Great Lakes Science Center]], the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum]], [[FirstEnergy Stadium (Cleveland)|FirstEnergy Stadium]], the [[Steamship William G. Mather Maritime Museum]], the [[USS Cod (SS-224)|USS ''Cod'']], [[Burke Lakefront Airport]], [[George Voinovich|Voinovich]] Bicentennial Park, and the [[Port of Cleveland|Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority]].

==Events==
The harbor was the site of the [[Great Lakes Exposition]], a historic event starting in 1936 that commemorated the [[centennial]] of Cleveland's incorporation as a city.

North Coast Harbor has been the home of multiple events over the years: [http://www.clevelandpride.org/home/ Cleveland Pride], [http://www.roverradio.com/tag/content/RoverFest RoverFest], [http://www.clevelandairshow.com/ Cleveland National Air Show], [http://ingenuitycleveland.com/ Ingenuity Festival], [http://pacificsportsllc.com/cleveland-tri-event-info/ Cleveland Triathlon],  [http://cmsd-artseducation.com/joomla/index.php/rockyourworldwithsteam Rock Your World with STEAM Family Festival], [http://www.gg9cle.com/ Gay Games], [http://runrocknroll.competitor.com/cleveland Rock'N'Roll Cleveland 1/2 Marathon]

In the summers of 2007 and 2008, the harbor hosted the [[AST Dew Tour]]'s [[Right Guard Open]]. In the summers of 2010 and 2013, the [http://www.portofcleveland.com/ Port Authority] sponsored an event called  [http://www.clevelandtallships.com/ Cleveland Tall Ships], which visits Cleveland's North Coast Harbor every 3 years and is presented by [http://www.clevelandtallships.com/festivalinfo/whatisrotary/ The Rotary Club of Cleveland].

The [[Cleveland Browns]] are spearheading development plans to construct an entertainment and commercial district in the area behind FirstEnergy Stadium and the Great Lakes Science Center.

[[Randy Lerner]], the former owner of The Browns, stated: 
"This is a unique opportunity for Cleveland to come together. We think the time has come to make the Lakefront a more dynamic and inviting area. We are very pleased to help with this concept, and we hope our interest attracts other private sector development geared toward making the Lakefront what it could and should be for the Cleveland community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelakefrontdistrict.com/ |title=Cleveland Browns Join Civic Efforts to Improve Lakefront |publisher=The Lakefront District |date=2011-02-28 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Browns aren't getting into the real estate business, they would like to stimulate private investment, "bridging a gulf that local governments and foundations aren't flush enough to fill."&lt;ref name="cleveland1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michelle |last=Jarboe McFee |url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2011/04/cleveland_browns_pitch_mixed-u.html |title=Cleveland Browns pitch mixed-use lakefront vision, hope to attract Cleveland Clinic, private investors |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland politicians and planners have floated many ideas for lakefront development over the years, yet much of the city's downtown waterfront is undeveloped and inaccessible.&lt;ref name="cleveland1"/&gt;

On March 19, 2012, Cleveland City Council approved key pieces of Mayor [[Frank G. Jackson|Frank Jackson]]'s lakefront plan, a development plan to transform the waterfront by remaking the shoreline from the Cuyahoga River east across Burke Lakefront Airport, while building on existing attractions, such as the East Ninth Street pier, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the Great Lakes Science Center and FirstEnergy Stadium. Architectural drawings include shops, restaurants, offices and a hotel tied together by walking and bicycle paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Thomas |last=Ott |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2012/03/cleveland_council_oks_lakefron.html |title=Cleveland City Council OKs lakefront plan |work=The Plain Dealer |date=2012-03-20 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rock &amp; Dock at the North Coast Harbor Transient Marina in Downtown Cleveland opened behind the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Grant |title=Transient marina opens new waterfront doorway to downtown Cleveland |url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2014/06/transient_marina_opens_new_wat.html |work=The Plain Dealer |date=2014-06-26 |accessdate=2014-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Cumberland Development, LLC and Trammel Crow Company were selected by City of Cleveland to develop 20+ acres surrounding Cleveland's North Coast Harbor. Phase 1; a restaurant on E9th pier was complete July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2016/07/06/first-look-nuevo-modern-mexican-on-the-e-ninth-street-pier&lt;/ref&gt; Ground breaking for Phase 2; multi-use space located in the former skate park just north of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame is scheduled for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2015/06/cleveland_lakefront_constructi.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3180">[[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield]] was appointed as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in June 1929 by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in the [[Labour Government 1929–1931|second Labour government]].  
He called a Colonial Office Conference in June–July 1930 to discuss general colonial questions including the Colonial Development Fund, communication and transport, trade questions, films and colonial labour reform. As part of the proceedings of the conference, Passfield issued what was termed the '''Passfield Memorandum''' of 1930, officially the '''Memorandum on Native Policy in East Africa''', which was a [[memorandum]] circulated to [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|colonial governors]] in the [[British Empire]]. This was an emphatic reassertion of the principles of the paramountcy of native interests first set out in the [[Devonshire Declaration]] of 1923, and in its place advocated a policy of trusteeship, whereby the imperial state would protect the interests of Africans.&lt;ref&gt;H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa: The Imperial Response of 1931 and Subsequent Implications. African Affairs, Vol. 78, No. 311, pp. 210-227 at p.217&lt;/ref&gt;

Devonshire’s successor as Colonial Secretary from 1924 to 1929 [[Leo Amery]], had sought to qualify this assurance, both during his 1927 tour of [[Southern Rhodesia]], when he suggested that the colony could amalgamate with [[Northern Rhodesia]] regardless of the substantial African majority in the later and in a [[White paper]] on East Africa in the same year. Passfield stated his intention of re-establishing Devonshire's principle of trusteeship, and rejected settler wishes for self-government in [[Kenya]] or Northern Rhodesia.&lt;ref&gt;H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa pp. 213-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Rhodesia, one effect of the Passfield Memorandum was to lessen the support of settlers for self-government as a separate entity in favour of amalgamation with Southern Rhodesia. However, Passfield and his Colonial Office officials would only consider transferring a relatively small area north of the [[Zambezi]] which contained the majority of settler farms to Southern Rhodesia.&lt;ref&gt;H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa pp. 217-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Labour Government in August 1931, there was no immediate change in the policy stated in the memorandum, but the 1938 report of the [[Bledisloe Commission]] recommended closer cooperation the two Rhodesias and [[Nyasaland]] possibly leading to future amalgamation or a loser federation. This marked a rejection of Passfield’s policy.&lt;ref&gt;H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa pp. 222-3.&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
The memorandum also "introduced a new era in colonial [[labour policy]]. [[Trade unions]] were to be encouraged, even though subject to registration".&lt;ref&gt;D. I. Davies, 'The Politics of the TUC's Colonial Policy', ''[[The Political Quarterly]]'', Vol. 35, No. 1. (1964), pp. 23-34&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Renato Usatîi''' (born 4 November 1978 in [[Fălești]]) is a [[Moldova]]n businessman and politician, since 13 April 2014 the chairman of [[Partidul Nostru (Moldova)|Our Party]], a left-wing populist opposition party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ru.publika.md/link_1288031.html|title=Бизнесмен Ренато Усатый стал председателем "Нашей партии"|date=14 April 2014|publisher=General Media Group|pages=Publika.md|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he was [[Moldovan local elections, 2015|elected]] the mayor of [[Bălți]] with the support of around 72% of votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ria.ru/world/20150615/1070004929.html|title=Бизнесмен Ренато Усатый лидирует на выборах мэра Бельцов в Молдавии|date=15 June 2015|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|language=Russian|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a leader of the pro-Russian opposition in Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.realitatea.net/renato-usatii-a-plecat-la-moscova-dar-promite-noi-dezvaluiri_1813799.html|title=Renato Usatîi a plecat la Moscova, dar promite noi dezvăluiri despre liderii de la guvernare|date=20 October 2015|publisher=realitatea.net|language=Romanian|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usatîi graduated in foreign languages from the [[Alecu Russo State University of Bălți|Bălți State University]]. In 2005 he started his own business, founding in Russia ″VPT-NN″, a company producing railway equipment. Since 2011, he was the major stakeholder of [[Universalbank]], one of the major banks of Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/spravka/20150615/1069200105.html|title=Биография Ренато Усатого|date=15 June 2015|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|language=Russian|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 October 2015 Usatîi was arrested in [[Chișinău]] and charged with illegal tampering of phone of [[Vlad Filat]], the former prime-minister who himself was arrested for corruption charges.

The '''Ritz Theatre''' is an African-American oriented theatre in the [[LaVilla, Jacksonville, Florida|LaVilla]] neighborhood of [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. The theater, which seats 426, is used for a variety of music, dance and theatrical productions, as well as movies. The spacious lobby is also used for private functions. Just off the lobby is the [[LaVilla Museum]] which holds
{{convert|11000|sqft|m2}} of exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coj.net/Departments/Ritz+Theatre+and+La+Villa+Museum/LaVilla+Museum.htm City of Jacksonville website]&lt;/ref&gt; LaVilla is considered "the mecca for African American culture and heritage" in Florida.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2840482-ritz_theatre_lavilla_museum_jacksonville-i Yahoo Travel Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Ritz Theater was designed in the [[Art Deco]] style by local architect Jefferson Powell and constructed in 1929.&lt;ref name=downtown&gt;[http://www.downtownjacksonville.org/detail/?loc_id=1904&amp;page_id=12 downtownjacksonville.org - Location Detail: Ritz Theatre &amp; LaVilla Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912131028/http://www.downtownjacksonville.org/detail/?loc_id=1904&amp;page_id=12 |date=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
LaVilla had a thriving, vibrant culture from 1921 to 1971, when it was known as the "Harlem of the South".&lt;ref name=Frommers/&gt; From the 1970s, the entertainment district of LaVilla went into decline and crime increased,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/showstory.php?Story_id=44708 Jax Daily Record:  03/10/2006 - Mullaney: decade of growth]&lt;/ref&gt; but Mayor Ed Austin's [[River City Renaissance]] plan included $4.2 million to renovate the theatre and museum. The groundbreaking for the project was in 1998, and the pair were reopened on September 30, 1999. The sign and northwest corner are all that remain of the original building.&lt;ref name=Frommers&gt;[http://www.frommers.com/destinations/jacksonville/A29920.html Frommers Destinations]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''undervalue transaction''' is a transaction entered into by a [[company (law)|company]]&lt;ref&gt;Some legal systems also apply undervalue transactions to insolvent individuals&lt;/ref&gt; who subsequently goes into [[bankruptcy]] which the court orders be set aside, usually upon the application of a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] for the benefit of the debtor's creditors.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in the [[United Kingdom]], and section 558FB of the [[Corporations Act 2001]] in [[Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Australian insolvency law]] they are referred to as '''uncommercial transactions'''.

Under ordinary principles of [[contract law]], the courts will not generally look into the adequacy of the [[consideration]] provided by either side.  However, if a company is in real peril of going into bankruptcy, many legal systems provide a mechanism that transactions which are seriously commercially disadvantageous to the company can be unwound, so as to prevent prejudice to the creditors of the company.

Normally, for a transaction to be set aside as an undervalue transaction, the liquidator or equivalent must demonstrate that:
#the consideration received by the company in the transaction, in money or money's worth is significantly less than the value, in money or money's worth, provided by the company;
#the transaction was entered into during the "vulnerability period"; and
#at the time of the transaction, the company was unable to pay its debts as they fell due, or became unable to pay its debts as they fell due as a result of the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;This is the ''cash-flow'' test of insolvency.  Some jurisdictions (although not many) apply the ''balance-sheet'' test of insolvency to undervalue transactions, either as an alternative to the cash-flow test, or in addition to it.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vulnerability period is the period of time immediately prior to the company going into bankruptcy.  The length of the vulnerability period varies between countries, and some countries apply different vulnerability periods in different circumstances.  For example, in the United Kingdom, the vulnerability period is either:
#two years, if the person with whom the company entered into the transaction with is a "connected person",&lt;ref&gt;Connected person is usually defined under the relevant legislation, e.g. in the United Kingdom, see section 249 of the Insolvency Act, and which is drafted so as to try and catch all insiders and affiliates, other than employees&lt;/ref&gt; or
#6 months, in all other cases.
The period is calculated by reference to the period of time immediately preceding the company going into liquidation or administration.

The effect of a successful application to have a transaction declared as an undervalue transaction varies.  Inevitably the other party to the transaction who received the benefit has to return the benefit (or account for it) it to the liquidator.  In some countries the assets are treated in the normal way, and may be taken by any [[secured creditor]]s who have a [[security interest]] which catches the assets (characteristically, a [[floating charge]]).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd'' (1997) BCC 282, now superseded by legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some countries have "ring-fenced" recoveries of unfair preferences so that they are made available to the pool of assets for [[unsecured creditor]]s.

Many jurisdictions which have prohibitions on undervalue transactions also provide for an exception in the case of transactions entered into in the [[ordinary course of business]] where the [[Board of directors|directors]] are of a view that it is for the benefit of the company, and such transactions are usually either validated or presumed to be validated.

'''Universal Annuity System''' is when an [[international community]] (e.g. the [[United Nations|UN]]) establishes a [[Funding|fund]] that the governments or communities of the world add to every year. These funds are invested.  The gains on these [[investment]]s are distributed evenly among the people as [[income]].  This process is known as the Universal Annuity System. A [[sovereign wealth fund]] at an international level.

He worked as a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a "botanic physician" and sold elixirs.{{Sfn | Chernow | 1998 | p = 11}} He was known to buy and sell horses, and was also known at one point to have bought a barge-load of salt in Syracuse. Land speculation was another type of his business, and the selling of elixirs served to keep him with cash and aided in his scouting of land deals. He loaned money to farmers at twelve percent, but tried to lend to farmers who could not pay so as to foreclose and take the farms.{{Sfn | Hawke | 1980 | pp = 10,24,25}} Two of his sons were Standard Oil co-founders [[John D. Rockefeller|John Davison Rockefeller Sr.]] and [[William Rockefeller|William Avery Rockefeller Jr.]]

== Family ==
William Avery Rockefeller was born in [[Ancram, New York]]{{Sfn | Hawke | 1980 | p = 4}}. He was the eldest son of businessman/farmer [[Godfrey Lewis Rockefeller]] (September 24, 1783, [[Albany, New York]] – September 28, 1857, [[Richford, New York]]) and Lucy Avery (February 11, 1786, [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]] – April 6, 1867). Godfrey and Lucy had married on September 20, 1806, in Amwell, Hunterdon County, New Jersey. Bill had two elder sisters—Melinda and Olympia—as well as seven younger siblings; Norman, Sally, Jacob, Mary, Miles, Mary Miranda, and Egbert.

== Ancestry ==
The Rockefellers trace their patrilineal line to Goddard Rockefeller (born Gotthard Rockenfeller) (1590) of Fahr, today part of [[Neuwied]], Germany. The first Rockefeller to emigrate to America (1723) was Johann Peter Rockenfeller (1710, Segendorf, [[Neuwied]]; 1787, [[Amwell Township, New Jersey]]), who changed his name to Rockefeller. Godfrey Lewis Rockefeller was a son of distant cousins William Rockefeller (1750–1793) and Christina Rockefeller (1754–1800).

Lucy Avery was born to Miles Avery and Melinda Pixley, New England Yankees of mostly English descent. She was descended by her father from [[Edmund of Langley]]'s first marriage (through [[James Touchet, 5th Baron Audley|5th Baron Audley]]'s second marriage)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogia.netopia.pt/pessoas/pes_show.php?id=986 GeneAll.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[Mary Boleyn]]'s first marriage (through the 2nd [[Baron de la Warr|Barons de la Warr]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogia.netopia.pt/pessoas/pes_show.php?id=2621 GeneAll.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage and children ==
Rockefeller married his first wife, Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 – March 28, 1889), a daughter of farmer John Davison and Cynthia Selover,&lt;ref name="Rockefeller Parents"&gt;{{cite web|last=Herrin|first=Donna|title=RootsWeb: DAVIDSON-L Re: [DAVIDSON-L] John Davison Rockefeller's parents|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/DAVIDSON/1999-01/0917239062|publisher=rootsweb|accessdate= 2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on February 18, 1837 in Niles, Cayuga Co., New York. John highly opposed the union. Since Cynthia had died when Eliza was twelve, Eliza had been raised by her elder sister, Mary Ann Davison, and father John. 

Rockefeller met Eliza on one of his business trips in Upstate New York. It is said that Rockefeller pulled out a slate and chalk to communicate when he arrived at the Davison residence, as he often pretended to be deaf and dumb on his selling trips. Eliza is to have supposedly remarked, "If that man were not deaf and dumb, I'd marry him."{{Sfn | Hawke | 1980 | p = 10}}

Bill and Eliza were the parents of three sons and three daughters: 
*Lucy Rockefeller (1838–1878), married Pierson Briggs
*[[John D. Rockefeller|John Davison Rockefeller Sr.]] (1839–1937), married [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller|Laura Celestia "Cettie" Spelman]] (1839–1915) 
*[[William Rockefeller|William Avery Rockefeller Jr.]] (1841–1922), married Almira Geraldine Goodsell (1844–1920)
*Mary Ann Rockefeller (1843–1925)
*[[Frank Rockefeller|Franklin "Frank" Rockefeller]] (1845–1917) [twin]
*Frances Rockefeller (1845–1847) [twin]

Bill once bragged, "I cheat my boys every chance I get. I want to make 'em sharp."{{Sfn | Segall | 2001 | pp = 15–16}} Although Bill abandoned the family while Lucy, John, and William Jr. were teenagers, he remained legally married to Eliza until her death. In 1856, having assumed the name Dr. William Levingston, he married Margaret Allen (1834–1910) in [[Norwich, Ontario]], Canada. Bill and Margaret had no children together. Before leaving his first wife, he also had two daughters with his mistress and housekeeper Nancy Brown:
*Clorinda Rockefeller (c. 1838–?, died young)
*Cornelia Rockefeller (c. 1840–?)

Before marrying Eliza, Bill had been in love with Nancy. However, he ended up marrying Eliza since her father was to give her $500 when she married, and Nancy was poor.&lt;ref name=Titan&gt;{{cite web|last=Chernow|first=Ron|title=The Flimflam Man|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/c/chernow-titan.html|publisher=New York Times|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When John D. Rockefeller started his own produce commission business with Maurice B. Clark in 1859, Clark initiated the idea of the partnership and offered $2,000 towards the goal. John D. Rockefeller had only $800 saved up at the time and so borrowed $1,000 from his father, "Big Bill" Rockefeller, at 10 percent interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Freeman Hawke|title=John D. The Founding Father of the Rockefellers|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, 1980|page=26|isbn=978-0060118136}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bill visited with his grandchildren at the Forest Hill estate in Cleveland and at Pocantico Hills in Tarrytown. He taught his grandchildren how to shoot and played fiddle in the evenings for them. Prior to Bill's visits, John D. would invite some of Bill's Upstate New York relatives and friends.{{Sfn | Hawke | 1980 | pp = 5,6}}

The court document reads, "That William A. Rockefeller late of the Town of Moravia in the County of Cayuga, on the first day of May in the year of the Lord Thousand Eight hundred and forty eight, with force and arms at the Town of Moravia in said County, in and upon one Ann Vanderbeak in the Peace of God with the People of the State of New York then and there being, violently did make and assault on her, the said Ann Venderbeak, then and there make violently and against her will feloniously did ravish and carnally know […]". William Cooper, the Rockefeller family Doctor, also indicated with the assault and battery with the intention of raping Ann Vanderbeak.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Because of the allegations, William sold the Moravia home and moved to [[Oswego, New York]], possibly to avoid trial,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; under the pretence of providing better opportunities for the boys.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Four days later, Eliza's father sued Bill in the Supreme Court of Cayuga for failure to pay a $1,175 debt. His plea states that Bill had asked him for help with his bail for the rape charges, but that Eliza's father had not seen Bill since. Eliza also informed authorities that her husband had "absconded and cannot now be found within the state."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; William assumed the title Doctor Bill Levingston&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and worked as a travelling [[snake oil]] specialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/13/books/from-dimes-to-millions-and-mystery.html|title=From Dimes To Millions And Mystery|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|date=1998-07-13|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although nothing became of the charges William left the family penniless.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gQwgjVVnJOcC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=snake+oil+rockefeller&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KqE-whyxei&amp;sig=DXgrW3ncuMO6BUKvmJTWLWhdw-s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4zJO73abQAhVpAcAKHdNcDpg4ChDoAQgnMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=snake%20oil%20rockefeller&amp;f=false|title=Money &amp; Power: The History of Business|last=Means|first=Howard|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After hearing rumours that John D. Rockefeller—then the richest man in the world at the height of his fame—had a shameful family secret, the press went into a frenzy. [[Joseph Pulitzer]] offered a reward of $8,000 for information about "Doc Rockefeller," who was known to be alive and living under a false name, but whose whereabouts were a family secret. Despite slender clues picked up from interviews with family members and an 18-month search, the journalists failed to track him down before he died. The full story was not exposed until two years later.

== Death ==
Rockefeller had spent some time in [[Park River, North Dakota]] under the Levingston alias. He died on May 11, 1906, at the age of 95 in [[Freeport, Illinois]]. He was buried there in Oakland Cemetery. John D. Rockefeller never publicly acknowledged the truth about his father's life as a [[bigamy|bigamist]], and the cost for Bill's grave marker was paid by the second wife's estate.
